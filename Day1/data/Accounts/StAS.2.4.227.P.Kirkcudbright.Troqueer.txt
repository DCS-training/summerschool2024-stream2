from oblivion by the published narrative of the Rev. Mr Crichton.
It is said that Lagg, who was the terror of the Covenanters of his
time over the whole south of Scotland, resided occasionally in this
parish at a place which is called Hag-hall to this day.
	Antiquities.--Close by the manse, and directly opposite to the
spot, on the other side of the river, where Cummin's castle for-
merly stood, is a moat of a circular form and considerable height,
where, according to oral tradition, the kings of Scotland, or their
vassal chiefs who were entrusted with the keeping of it, used to
hang offenders, and the most daring of their captives taken in
battle, or in acts of pillage and robbery. The more probable con-
jecture is, that it was one of the circular mounds where the baron
or judge of the district held courts of Justice in the open air.
	Parochial Registers.--The register of proclamations begins
April 1713; that of baptisms, 14th June 1734. The parish re-
cords begin about the same time. All of them are, for a long pe-
riod, extremely meager and scanty. It may be mentioned here,
that the records of the Presbytery of Dumfries commence 5th
August 1647.

			  IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Rental of the Parish.--In the year 17512, the rental was ascer-
tained before the Court of Session to be L.950; in the year 1791,
it was nearly L.5000; and in the year 1819, L.12,000. And
though landed property has fallen considerably in value of late,
yet the rental of the parish may still be regarded as L.11,000.
	Fishery.--There is a fishery in the Nith, drawn on the Troqueer
side of the river opposite to Dumfries, which furnishes salmon,
grilse, and herlings, more than sufficient for the supply of the two
burghs and the adjoining country.

	Maxwelltown.--Maxwelltown, fnrmerly Bridgend, has a claim to
a particular account. About twenty-one years ago, it was erected
into a burgh of barony, with a provost, two bailies, and four coun-
cillors elected annually; and it was named in Honour of Mr Max-
well of Nithsdale, its superior. It stands opposite to the burgh
of Dumfries, with which it is connected by two bridges. It stands
