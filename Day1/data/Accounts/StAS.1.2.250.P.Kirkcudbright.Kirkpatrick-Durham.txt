west,-by Glencairn and Duscore, on the north,-and by
Holywood and Kirkpatrick-Irongray, on the east.  The church

its extent, is, in a very large proportion, covered with heath.

the grain, which is produced on such spots as have been culti-

   -The chief excellence, for which it is distinguished, is the
store of game, with which it abounds.  Kirkpatrick moor has
long been celebrated for that production; and, on the return
