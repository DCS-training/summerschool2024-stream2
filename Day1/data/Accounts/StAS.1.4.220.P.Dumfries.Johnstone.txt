There are 6 labouring oxen at Raehills.  During the 5 last
years, there have been annually ploughed, at an average,
850 acres, most of which is employed in rasing oats.  Per-
haps an 8th or 9th part is sown with bear, barley, rye,
peas, etc.  Next to oats, bear is the staple grain here.
Rye holds the next place.  Our peas and flax take but
little room.  The land on which they sow bear, barley
and rye is generally the potato and turnip ground of the
preceding year.  The sowing of grass is a new piece of
husbandry with us, and is still in its infancy.  There were
40 acres sown with artificial grasses last season.  As the
land is only beginning to be improved, the pastures are but
poor, and must be extensive; they comprehend all the re-
manent parts of the parish, excepting what is taken up by
roads and plantations.  The commonty, which was very
considerable, was divided not long ago.  In ordinary sea-
sons, the farmers are employed from the middle of March
to the middle of April, in sowing oats; in the end of April
they plant potatoes.  Such as sow barley and grass-seeds, do it
early in May, though sometimes the grasses are sown later.
Towards the middle of July, they begin to cut their rye-grass
and clover.  Meadow hay is about a month later in ripening.
September is usually the harvest month for barley and oats;
but in some untoward seasons, there is often a good deal to
cut down at the commencement of October.  The whole
rental is said to be at present about L. 1300; but owing to
the improvements now going on, it must soon be more than
double.  Best arable and pasture land is said to rent from
8 s. to 12 s. the acre; inferior, from 3 s. to 6 s.  Average
size of farms is 160 acres, and their number is mucn in-
creased these last 10 years.  Most of our farmers have 2
ploughs a-piece; one strong and heavy, for breaking
