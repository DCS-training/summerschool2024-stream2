     of Nielston.

One of these, and the principal of them, is called Lavern-wa-
ter, rising in the high grounds in the south part of Nielston,
and running north-east through the district.  Its stream is na-
turally small; but within these few years, some companies
concerned in the cotton-mill, the Faraneze print-field, and
several bleachfields situated along its banks, not without
some difficulty in settling with a number of heritors, in this and
the neighbouring parish of Mearns, obtained a lease, with liber-
ty to get the source of this water dammed up, with a breast-work
of about 16 feet high.  The springs above this being numerous,
and the land level, a tract of country, of about a mile in
length, and half a mile in breadth, called the Long-Loch,
is overflowed, so that, during the greatest drought in sum-
mer, by drawing the fluice three inches, there is a plentiful
supply of water to drive all the machinery in the public works
erected, and still erecting on this stream.  This bason, extend-
ing along part of the march between Nielston and Mearns,
was formerly a loch, though, it is believed, not so extensive
as at present, and had been drained many years ago by the
surrounding proprietors, by which they obtained a considerable
tract of coarse hay and pasturage.  Some trout from Lavern
have lately been put into it, where, it is expected, they will
thrive exceedingly.  When the present lease expires, the a-
bove companies must make a new agreement with the pro-
prietors*, who, no doubt, are by this time, fully apprised of
its increased value.
   There is another loch in the west end of the parish, called

*It is said, that at the last settlement, Archibald Speirs, Esq.
of Elderslie, who is a very considerable, if not the greatest pro-
prietor of the adjacent lands, was very disinterested, wishing to en-
courage manufactures.
