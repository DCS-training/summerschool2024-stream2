to their great disappointment, they found nothing there but
the ashes of Olaus.-General Campbell converted this mount
into a family burying place.  It is inclosed and planted.  On
the top of it a neat monument is built; and there the Ge-
neral lately deposited the remains of his only son, a pro-
mising youth of 3 or 4 years of age, whose death must have

for the above reason, avail themselves of the advantage to
any extent.  Besides, by the intervention of the point Kin-

prosperity and happiness of the Highlands in general, and
to raise its inhabitants to that degree of political importance,
which their local advantages might enable them to attain,
two things are necessary, an exemption from the coal duty,
and a canal at Crinan, to open an expeditious and safe com-
munication with the more improved and opulent parts of the
kingdom.  To accomplish either of these objects, is no doubt,
