     Statistical Account

   Lord Airly gave the example of enclosing, draining,
and otherwise improving the soil.  His enclosures are all 
of the most substantial kind:  The walls are brought to 2 
level at the height of 4 feet; then covered with large flag
stones, projecting 2 or 3 inches on each side; and to bind
and keep all fast, there is set above these a capping of 
stone, placed on edge, which stands strong like an arch.
The enclosures of Ballbeuchy are done after the same 
manner:  Those of Dronlaw and Scotston are carrying on 
in a similar style:  The 2 Adamston were enclosed many
years ago; but, from the want of good materials, the 
fences are not so complete as those upon the other estatcs
in the parish.  Proprietors and tenants are now so well
convinced of the superior advantage of enclosed ground to
open fields, and such is the present prevailing spirit of im-
provement in all the branches of agriculture, that it is
thought, within a few years hence, the whole arable land
of the parish will be enclosed.  These walls are built at
24s. the rood:  8s. for quarrying, 8s. for driving, and 8s.
for building.
   As to cropping, the farmers differ somewhat in opinion,
and vary in practice.  Yet all are agreed, that their inte-
rest lies in sowing out annually a large portion of their
farm with grass seeds, chiefly red and white clover, and
rye-grass; and also in having a good deal of pease, tur-
nips, potatoes, and yams.  Oats and barley are our prin-
cipal crops.  Some wheat is sown, but it does not often 
prove beneficial.  Pease meliorate the ground, and yield
excellent fodder.  It is for these reasons they are sown,
and not for any other return they make; the encrease, in 
most seasons, being rather scanty.  Turnips, potatoes, and
yams, succeed remarkably well.  With the former, great 
number of cattle are sed every winter for the butcher.
