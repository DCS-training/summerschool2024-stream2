     John Scott, the last of Whitslade, sold that estate, which then
consisted of Whitslade, Castleside, the Readforgreens, Ashkirk,
Ashkirk-mill, Salanside, Bradley, &c. only about the year 1722.
And Thomas Scott, the last of Todrig, who had been a brave
warrior, both by sea and land, only sold Todrig in 1748, hav-
ing sold the estate of Wester Essenside a few years before.  He
died in 1753, and was buried at Ashkirk in an isle now removed.
His arms were cut in wood on his seat in the old church, bearing
the date 1622.  It will be seen from the list of land-owners al-
ready given, that Synton and Woll are the only properties that
now remain in the possession of the illustrious name of Scott.
     The details now given may be regarded by some of the mere
utilitarians of the age, as fit onlv to amuse the idle hours of the
antiquary, but they will appear in a different light to the philoso-
pher and historian, who are anxious to unfold the laws that regu-
late the distribution of wealth and property among the great fa-
mily of mankind.
     Antiquities and Traditions.--Besides the ruins of the Palace
of the Bishop of Glasgow, already mentioned, there are two Dan-
ish encampments on the farm of Castleside,--the one entire, but
the other much effaced by the plough.  There was formerly a
very strong tower or keep on the lands of Salantiside, but now the
ruins are scarcely visible.  There are also in various other places
vestiges of encampments, but their origin cannot be very accurate-
ly ascertained.
