a female servant had from L.3 to L.3., 1Os. yearly, and now from L.5,
1Os. to L.6, 10s. Then a married workman, with house, garden,
peats, two cows' grass, and potatoe-land, had L.1 of money; now
he gets from L.7 to L.8. Common labourers had from 1s. 2d. to
1s. 4d., and tradesmen from 2s. to 2s. 4d. per day; now the for-
mer have from 1s. 6d. to 2s., and the latter from 2s. 6d. to 3s.
6d. per day.
   The improvements of which the parish is susceptible cannot be
here stated, even in the Most general way.  Much of it is in a state
of nature, and requires draining, enclosing, &c.  The cottages
are often deficient in every comfort, and farm-houses and stead-
ings ill constructed and difficult to maintain.  Lochgilp ought to
be dredged, so as to permit steam-boats and other vessels of bur-
den to go to the village. These and other improvements may
safely be entrusted to the self-interest of parties. There is a re-
warkable bank, formed of sand and debris from the bills on each
side of Locbfyne at Ottar. This bank, with the other depositions by
which the bed of Lochfyne must necessarily be raised in its level from
year to year, by the disintegration of rocks, the carrying away of
banks, &c., may possibly effect great changes upon the character of
the loch above Ottar on some future day, by obstructing the ingress
of the tide, and converting that upper portion into a fresh water
lake with its river entering the sea; and would it not be worthy
of the heritors to take some measure of making such observations
on each- side of the Ottar, as may be necessary to ascertain the
rate of increase of this bank, if any ; whether there be a tendency
to the formation of a similar bank down on the north side, &c. &c.?
