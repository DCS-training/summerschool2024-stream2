ably past 70 years, upwards of 40 of which he taught
a charity school.  The Society have given him an as-
sistant.  He has the grass of 2 cows from the Duke of
Argyll, and a piece of ground for potatoes and other
crop.  The parochial school is stationed in Ross, near
the only church in the parish; but such is the wretched
state of this school, that the schoolmaster is a man who,
upon examination, was refused by Dr. Kemp to be the
assistant to the charity school of I.  The school stent of
the parish, is 8 L. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling yearly*.
   There are, at an average, 60 upon the poors list.
These may be said to depend entirely upon the humanity
of the people.  The collections upon Sundays, and a few
fines, are the only funds the session have for their re-
lief; and these do not exceed 5 L. or 6 L. yearly.

   Post Office.-There is no post office in the parish.
The nearest post office is Aross, which is at the distance
of 20 long computed miles from the point of Ross.  To

*The Duke of Argyll pays his share, which is between 4 L. and 5 L.;
but the rest of the heritors pay none, pleading as an execuse, that the
school is of no service to their properties.  There was a charity school
stationed in Airdmeanach for 2 years; but as the heritors of that dis-
trict did not accommodate the schoolmaster according to the regulations
of the Society, the school was withdrawn.  The people of the parish
wish to have schools; but cannot support them without assistance.
There are at present boys teaching in different corners of the parish;
but it would be better to want teachers who can hardly read them-
selves.  The incumbent, who, though within a mile of the parochial
school, was obliged to get a teacher from the Low Country, is joined by
many of his neighbours (who did not choose to have their children un-
der the tuition of the parochial schoolmaster) in building a school-house,
and in paying some of the tutor's wages.
