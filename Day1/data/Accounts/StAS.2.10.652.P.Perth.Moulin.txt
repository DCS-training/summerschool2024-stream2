Fatal as was the Asiatic cholera of 1831-2, it was'not a severer
scourage than the fell epidemic of 1837. From the ravages of the
former we happily escaped, and those who were carried off by the
latter were persons of consumptive and asthmatic habits ; or indivi-
duals of extreme old age.  Of the 24 who attained the age of
seventy or upwards, 12 were eighty and of these again, 4 were
upwards of ninety years of age; of the 24, there were 11 males,
and 13 females, and their united ages amounted to 1908 years.

   Language.-The language generally spoken is the Gaelic, and
it is evident from a little intercourse with the people, that it has
lost ground very considerably within the last fifty years. The
older people of the parish speak it with classical correctness,
where its the rising generation intermixes it with many Anglicisms.
   Habits of the People, &c.-The population is composed princi-
pally of respectable tenants and tradesmen, In their babits they
are cleanly. Their dwellings are kept for the most part, in good
order ; they undergo more or less of daily purification ; and it is
not unusual to see the most part of Saturday devoted to this healthy
operation.  Their style of dress is fast assimilating itself to that of
their - southern neighbours. Home made cloths are little worn.
It were well however, if, some of our young people would find
way to the Pitlochry Saving's  Bank and not throw away
their scanty earnings on exterior personal embellishment. It is so no
doubt, extremely pleasing anf highly becoming, to see our youth
