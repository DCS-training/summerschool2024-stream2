   Rental.-Wandell is valued in the cess books at L. 1300 Scots,
real rental, L. 1396 Sterling; Lammingtoune is valued in the same
at L. 1300 Scots, real rental, L. 1843, IOs.  It is curious to note
the fluctuations of the value of landed property at successive periods.
For instance, the rental af Lammingtoune estate in 1656 was
L. 4000 Scots, or L. 333 Sterling.  In 1775, it was L. 448 5s. 2d.
In 1792, Mr Mitchell states it at between L. 700 and 800, and in
1824, the then factor, Mr Stobie, stated it to me, on raising my
process of augmentation, at L. 2250.
   There are two uninhabited houses in Wandell, and the same
number in Lammingtoune, besides the new inn not quite completed.
There are in the parish, I blacksmith, I tailor, whose, wages per
day, when he goes out to work in families, are Is. 4d. besides vic-
tuals; 3 shoemakers, 4 weavers, 2, wrights.  There are two shops
in the village, where " tea, sugar, tobacco and snuff" are sold, with
a variety of other small groceries; and loaf bread is retailed in
them, from the bakers in Biggar.  There, has long been an inn,
or rather public-house in the village, at which carriers frequently
put up; and, though contrary to act of Parliament, the keeper
of the toll-bar at Hartside, a short distance to the south of the inn,
has always a license to sell whisky and ale.  There are now no corn-
mills in the parish, so that it lies under the disadvantage of having
to send all grain either to Culter or Robertoun, three miles distant.
   Character of the people.-The people, generally speaking, are
healthy and robust, of good size and of active habits; and not pe-
culiarly subject to any particular ailment or disease, if we except
perhaps rheumatism, here commonly called the pains.
are, on the whole, cleanly, orderly in their household economy,
sober, temperate, peaceable,  industrious, and neighbourly and oblig-
ing to one another.  They are much less given to intemperance
