with different alterations and amendments, renewed at the
end of every 7th year.  By the present law, (which is to ex-
pire in 1793,) they have 30 s. per ton, when they make two-
thirds of a full cargo, and only 20 s. per ton, when they
have less.  The hardship of having the bounty less, when
they have little or no fish, and therefore stand most in need
of it, is obvious.  It is not then sufficient, they say, to de-
fray the expence incurred by the number of men, which they
must have by the law, more than are necessary for the busi-
ness.  They hope, therefore, that, upon a renewal of the act
they may be allowed 30 s. per ton, whatever may be their
success in fishing.  With respect to the article of salt, the
present law gave satisfaction, as being wise and liberal.  This
article they can now have from their neighbours at Liver-
pool, on easier terms than they had it formerly from Spain
and Portugal.  But they still complain of the many incon-
venient and embarrassing regulations, to which they are sub-
jected at custom-houses, before salt bonds can be cancelled.
It is the general opinion, that the whole present system of
laws, respecting salt for curing fish anti other articles, stands
much in need of being revised and amended.
   The following is the average state of the fishing business
in this place, for the last 7 years.

   In a successful year, the profits of a voyage, between fish
and bounty, are said to be considerable: But it is reckoned
a bad business, when a vessel falls short of catching half its
cargo.  One thing is evident, that neither individuals, nor
the community here, have made much by prosecuting the
fishery on the present plan; and one may venture to say, they
