neral Dispensary; the five, medical men previously attending con-
tinued to officiate, and, in fact, the only changes consisted in the
establishment of a single dep" of medicines, the election of a
single set of managers, and the allotment of the town and suburbs
into five districts, of which one was assigned to each of the medi-
cal attendants ; lately a sixth medical attendant has been added,
and a district has been assigned to him by a new division of the
town.
   For several years, there was a midwife attached to each district,
to whom was assigned the care of all ordinary cases, (for which a
small allowance was made according to the number of cases,) the
medical attendants giving their assistance when cases of difficulty
occurred ; but in 1834, the low state of the funds compelled the
managers to discontinue the allowance, and since that time the
medical attendants have taken charge of all the midwifery cases
applying at the institution, which, however, have been of late com-
paratively few.
     In 1831, the smallpox being very prevalent in Aberdeen,'it
appeared to the medical attendants of the dispensary, that in vi-
siting among the poor, they possessed peculiar facilities for en-
couraging among them the practice of vaccinating their children,
which was too generally neglected.  It was therefore resolved to
give attendance weekly at the dispensary for the purpose of vac-
cinating children.
   Mr John Burnett had by his will, dated 1783, bequeathed a
sum of money to be applied for the prevention of small-pox, and
on the promulgation of Dr Jenner's discovery, this sum was ap-
propriated to defray the expense of an institution for vaccination.
For a good many years, the numbers who were benefited by this
institution were considerable, but in consequence partly of the in-
creasing prevalence of the custom of midwives Vaccinating the
children at whose birth they had assisted, and partly of the ne-
gligence of parents to avail themselves of the means of avoiding
a disease wbose ravages were become much less formidable than
they had formerly been, the Vaccine Institution declined very
much, so that at the time when the medical attendants of the
General Dispensary began to vaccinate, the office of the Vac-
cinator had become little better than a sinecure, and medical meet
often experienced great inconvenience from the inadequate supply
of lymph that could be obtained at the Vaccine Institution.  These
circumstances, and the success which had attended the attempt to
