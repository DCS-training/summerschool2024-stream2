of the masters of the Hioh School of Edinburgh.  In 1739 he
was appointed by the Duke of Buccleuch to the grammar school
of Dalkeith.  Having taught here with great ability apd success
for eleven years, he died on the 20th September 1750, at the age
of 55.  His character is thus described by Ruddiman: " For his
uncommon knowledge in classical learning, his indefatigable dili-
gence, and strictness of discipline without severity, Mr John Love
was justly accounted one of the most sufficient masters in the
country."
   Mr James Barclay was appointed master of Dalkeith Grammar
School in 1750.  He conducted the business of the school with
great ability and success, and died in 1765. ++
