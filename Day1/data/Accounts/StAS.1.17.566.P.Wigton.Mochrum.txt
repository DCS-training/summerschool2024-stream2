usual increase.  The 3 d year, every good farmer allows to
each acre about 50 cart loads of dung, or sea-weed, lows on
it 4 or 5 bushels of bear, with 2 of rye-grass, and 12 or 14
lbs. of red and white clover.
   The ordinary produce of bear, upon land so treated, is from
10 to 14 seeds.  The 4th year concludes the process with a
hay crop, the acre commonly yielding between 200 and 300
stones.  The land is then turned into pasture, for 6 years at
least; and, when opened again, is generally dunged on the
first plowing, and the same order of cropping observed as be-
fore.  The oats, when properly cleaned, weigh about 38 lbs.
and the bear 48 lbs. a bushel.
   Of the former, Mochrum annually exports about 6,000,
and of the latter 10,800 bushels.-The oats at 1 s. 10 d. and
the bear at 2 s. 9 d.
   This grain is chiefly carried to the markets of Liverpool
and Whithaven, and sometimes a little of it is taken to
Greenock.  Some two-rowed barley and wheat are raised;
but of these the quantities are so small, as scarcely to deserve
notice.  It is a common observation here, that Galloway is
not a wheat country, which is certainly true; but owing,
perhaps, more to this than any other causes, that it is very
little attended to, or sown.
   The harvest usually begins about the middle of August,
and is finished about the end of September.
   Fallowing the soil is too seldom practised, and turnips are
so rare a sight, that no sooner do they make their appearance
in a field, than the neighbouring boys set upon them, like
apples in an orchard, and eat or carry them away.

   Servants wages.-The ordinary wages given to a man ser-

they are all engaged, and to a woman servant from 30 s. to
