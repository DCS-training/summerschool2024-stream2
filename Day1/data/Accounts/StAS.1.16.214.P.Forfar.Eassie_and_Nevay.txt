   Rivers, etc.-The Dean, which flows from the loch of
Forfar, forms the northern boundary of Essie, and runs
westward to the Isla, into which it falls near Meigle.  As
this deep and sluggish river passes through a very level
country, there are few falls sufficient for the purpose of ma-
chinery.  Between its source and termination, the difference
of elevation does not exceed 40 feet in the space of ten
miles.  At Cookstown, however, a mile W. N. W. of the
church of Essie, there is a corn and a lint mill, both on the
north bank of the river, and a communication to the south-
ward is opened by a bridge lately constructed.  This river
is noted for the large size and delicious taste of its trouts.
It contains also pike and perch, but no salmon, except a few
black fish or kelt in autumn.
   A rivulet, which rises in the hill of Nevay, and is aug-
mented by a small stream from a drain in the marsh al-
ready mentioned, forms the western limit of the parish of
Essie, and county of Forfar.  In its progress northward it
turns a mill, below which it loses itself in the Dean.
   Another rivulet, called the burn of Essie, descends from
a hill in the Sidla ridge, bathes the wall of the church-
yard, and falls into the Dean.  On this rivulet there is a
lint-mill about a quarter of a mile S. E. of the church, on
the turnpike-road to Glammis.  There is no lake nor stag-
nate water in either parish.
