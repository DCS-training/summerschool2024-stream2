   Live-Stock.-The common breeds of sheep are the black-faced
and Cheviot on principal tacks, and the small Highland kind on
the possessions of the crofter. The Highland breed of cattle is
universally reared, with the exception of a few Ayrshire cows, which
some tacksmen keep for their milk. . As the latter require more
provender, and are but little in demand at market, they are sel-
dom reared.The breeds of sheep and cattle have of late years
been greatlyimproved, by purchasing at high prices superior tups
and bulls.Small tenants seldom rear bulls for their own little
stock, but are supplied with the same from the tacksmen's stocks,
which tends greatly to improve the general breed of the parish.
The indigenous Highland breed are known over all the kingdom
for their symmetry and hardiness, and, though generally small in
size, they fetch higher prices at market, than cattle of inferior
breed, though of greater weight. The sheep on large farms ate
regularly smeared every season with butter and tar. This.process
seems indispensable for rendering the stock healthy, andifor de-
fending them against.tbe effects of a wet and boisterous climate.
   Husbandry.-It must be acknowledged, that, with the excep-
tion of large farms, the state of husbandry is still very unimprov-
ed. The tillage is conducted in a slovenlv and unprofitable man-
ner, and no encouragement can possibly effect any niateriaV itA_
provement, while the place remains burdened with a redundant
and helpless population. The lotting system has proved ruinous
to the country, in so far as it has been the means of increasing the
