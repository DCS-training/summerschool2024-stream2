scription was opened for building a bridge, and the contri-

   Remarkable Customs, etc.-A number of trisling ceremo-
nies, which had their origin in superstition, are still conti-
nued at christenings, burials, and other solemn or festive occa-
sions; but they seem to be retained rather from an attach-
ment to old usages, than from the belief, that the obser-
vance or omission of them is attended with any important
effect.  It is observable that those gymnastic exercises,
which constituted the chief pastime of the Highlanders 40 or
50 years ago, have almost totally disappeared.  At every
fair or meeting of the country people, there were contests
at racing, wrestling, putting the stone, etc.; and on holidays,
all the males of a district, young and old, met to play at
football, but oftener at shinty*.  These games are now prac-
tised only by school-boys, having given place to the more ele-
gant, though less manly, amusement of dancing, which is
become very common, especially on holidays.  A shooting
match, for some small prize, occupies part of the day; and
in tne evening, they repair to a ball, in a barn or tap-room,
where they enjoy all the pleasures of rural festivity.

*Shinty is a game played with sticks, crooked at the end, and balls of
wood.
