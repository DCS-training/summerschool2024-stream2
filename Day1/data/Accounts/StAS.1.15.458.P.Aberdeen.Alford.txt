been lately introduced by Mr Leith of Whitehaugh, upon his
own very extensive farm, in the neighbouring parish of Til-
lynessle; they possess the advantage of ripening three weeks
before the common oat, and therefore the extension of their
use will be a great improvement
   The bear grown in this country by common farmers, is
all of the Scotch kind; and though the seed is procured in the
same way as that of oats, weighs, in general, 18 stones per
boll+, and will, in particular situations and seasons, even
come to 20 and 21 stones.  A considerable quantity of meal
and bear, probably from 800 to 900 bolls, is annually sent
from this parish to Aberdeen, our only or chief market for
grain.  Bear and oatmeal have given good prices of late years,
though the smallness of our meal is a great disadvantage to it
in the West country market, to which it was usually sent
some years ago.  Oats are never carried to market by our far-
mers, though there is a demand for them; a circumstance
which must be attributed more to habit than the effects of
thirlage.  Potatoes are not much used here, though every per-
son who rents land plants a small quantity.  The common peo-
ple are not very fond of them, and they think them unwhole-
rome; nor will farm servants make a meal of them, or even
eat them without milk or butter, so readily as in other parts
of Scotland.  To pease-meal or bear-meal they have rather a
dislike; and in general, garden vegetables of all sorts are not
so much cultivated or used as in other parts of the kingdom.
Very little flax has been hitherto raised in this country; and
as we have excellent soil for it, and the country people are
under the necessity of buying all the linen, when they might
get it much cheaper by manufacturing it at home, this want
of flax must be attributed to the difficulty in dressing the lent;
