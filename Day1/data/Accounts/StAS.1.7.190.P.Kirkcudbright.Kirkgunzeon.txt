     Statistical Account

   Rent and Productions.-The whole rent of the parish does
not yet amount to 2000 L. Sterling; but any farms that have
been lately out of lease, have been raised one third.  The
number of farms are about 50.  None are under 5 L. or more
than 100 L. of yearly rent.  The average rent of the arable
or pasture ground cannot be easily ascertained.  As some of
the best grounds are either in the possession of the proprie-
tors, or are set by the lump; but according to the rate of the
country, the arable might set from more than 1 L. to less than
5 s.; the pasture from 5 s. to 1 s.; the meadows, of which
there are a considerable proportion, are mostly valued at 1 L.
per acre.  The staple commodities of the parish are black
cattle and oat meal, the former bought up for the English
markets, the latter for the manufacturing towns in the west
of Scotland.  Liverpool and Whitehaven afford a ready mar-
ket for barley, and whatever other articles the parish pro-
duces, such as mutton, wool, pork, butter, cheese, poultry,
&c. are generally sold at Dumfries, which is 9 miles distant.
The principal feuel is peats, of which there are abundance.
English coal may be had at much the same price as in Dum-
fries.

   Roads.-The principal road, which divides the parish in
almost equal parts, was made by the commutation money,
and is in good repair; as also two bridges upon it, that were
built at the expence of the county.  The more private roads
are improving yearly.  The statute labour, while it conti-
nued, was of little effect.  There has lately been some pro-
posals of bringing the great road from London to Portpatrick
through this parish; should this ever take place, it would
prevent many disagreeable pulls, that cannot otherwise be
avoided; but in this case there would be 7 or 8 miles of en-
