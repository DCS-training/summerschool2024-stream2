   The rent of the salmon-fishing in the Tay, opposite to
this parish, may be rated at L. 27 Sterling.  The salmon
caught here are sold to Perth, and from thence are sent to
the London market.  The following are the prices paid, of
late years, for them per lb. viz. early in spring, 8 d.; in
April, 6 d.; in May, 4 d.; and during the remainder of the
season, 3 d.  The average weight of a Tay salmon here is
18 lb.  Dutch weight.  One, however, was caught which
weighed 63 lb. 3 oz.
   Some years ago, mussels were gathered in the bed of the
river in considerable numbers, for the sake of the pearls
they contained.  Crowds of people were seen daily wander-
ing in search of them.  But a London dealer, who had pur-
chased the pearls, becoming bankrupt, with the price in his
hands, the spirit of this traffic was damped, and has not
again revived.  Several pearls then found were sold for
10 s. 6 d. and one brought 13 s.
   Loch Ordie abounds with trout and eel.  It is favourite
resort of anglers from Dunkeld, who have often agreeable
reason to remember the amusement which its banks afford.

time employed as a manure, but was found not to suit the soil here.  It is
now used by the poor as fuel.
