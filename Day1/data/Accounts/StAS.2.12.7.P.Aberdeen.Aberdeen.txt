very seldom above 60&deg;.
   The following Table, drawn up by Mr George Innes, shows the
monthly mean temperature for the last seven years- the thermo-
meter being placed freely exposed to the E. N. E., and at the
height of 16 feet above the surface of the ground, and the obser-
vations being made daily at 8 A. M. and 9 P. M.

   The fluctuations of the barometer are not in general either very
great or very sudden.  It scarcely ever rises above 30.5 inches, or
sinks below 28.  The effect of the east wind in raising it, or in
preventing its fall on the approach of rain, is very frequently to be
observed.  In the following table Mr Innes has collected the
monthly mean for the last seven years-the barometer being
placed at the height of 45 feet above half flood, and observed night
and morning.

   No series of observations with the hygrometer has been record-
ed, nor indeed are such very satisfactory when they are made.
The principles of the various instruments of this kind that are in
use are liable to several fallacies which it is not easy to remove,
and nearly impossible to make due allowance for.  Some of them
