were afraid of going in search of him, the story spread
that he bewildered himself in the cave, and was lost.
People might also find it their interest to propagate this
story, and give a horrid idea of the cave, as it was used
for a place of shelter in troublesome times.  There is a
cave in Inimore, called the Nun's Cave.  It is singular
in nothing but its being the habitation of nuns  Tra-
dition is silent as to the time they lived here; whether
before the dissolution of the nunnery at I, or whether
they sheltered themselves in this sequestered place upon 
that revolution's taking place.  Several crosses are cut
in the sides of the cave, but the initials of names are
modern.

   Quadrupeds and Birds.-The only wild quadrupeds
in the parish are deer, foxes, and rabbits.  The rabbits
may be called strangers, having appeared first within
these few years.  The deer have always been natives.
In harvest, they often leave the mountains, and eat the
corns in the low grounds of Ross and Brolass; and, in
severe winters, they have been known to mix with the
black cattle, and take their share of the corn with
which they were fed.  The mountains being now stock-
ed with sheep, may, in the course of a few years, banish
them from the island of Mull.  There is all the va-
riety of land-birds found in the parish, that are gene-
rally met with in other parts of the Highlands; such as
eagles, hawks, kites, wild geese, pigeons, moor fowls,
black cocks, tarmagans, &c. &c.  The sea fowls are as
numerous as the kinds are various; such as cormorants,
scarts, teels, scale drakes, ducks of various kind, etc.
The migratory are swans, swallows, cuckoos, lapwing,
