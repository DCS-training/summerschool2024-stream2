good sward, abounding with excellent pasture-grasses, which
retain, even in dry seasons, a beautiful verdure.  Some
patches of heath and bent grass, here and there, interrupt the
uniformity of the verdure.  The soil is generally not deep,
and is incumbent on whinstone.  These high lands remain
mostly uninclosed, except by a few dikes of earth or turf,
that formerly had, in irregular forms, chiefly circular, been
drawn round some small parcels of ground, once in tillage.
These small inclosures, if they deserve the name, are now
very properly left in pasture, except one or two adjoining
to each dwelling-house, and which are cropped mostly with
oats and potatoes.  The produce in these high situations is
extremely scanty, and the harvest very late.  This muir-
land district is much intersected by deep and very narrow
glens; the verdant sides of which afford not only pasture,
but sometimes an excellent shelter for sheep.  Large clumps,
and stripes of trees, are much desiderated in these naked and
exposed places.  There is every reason to believe, that their
growth would be so quick as amply to repay any necessary
expences.
   These muirs are pastured mostly with the speckled-faced
sheep, chiefly from the sheep districts, north of Strathearn,
as Killin, etc.  This variety of sheep is preferred to the
black-faced Linton breed, for their weight and hardiness,
and being sooner ready for the market.  Severe colds, and
long storms in winter, are the greatest evils to which sheep
are exposed in this high district.

   Agriculture.-In the lower and arable parts of the parish,
considerable improvements have of late been made in agri-
culture.  Summer-fallow and green crops are introduced
into every farm; and a regular succession of crops is gene-
rally observed.  Some farmers have adopted what is here
commonly called the Carse of Gowrie system, which is,
