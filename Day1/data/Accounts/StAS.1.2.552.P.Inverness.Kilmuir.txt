than the wall which senced them, and then withered.-This
parish has more land, employed in raising corn, than any other
in this island.  In the particular district in which the incum-
bent lives, the eye can at one view fee four miles, wich look
like one continued field of corn, there not being the smallest por-
tion of muir within that extent.  The rest of the parish also, is
well enough calculated for the production of corn, though not
equal to this part.  It supplies itself with provision, and in plen-
tiful years it furnishes oatmeal to those adjacent; but when the
crop happens to sail, the inhabitants live worse than those in
other parishes.  The slatness of the country, disqualifying it
for breeding sheep; and their finest being in tillage , sum-
mer grass is rendered more scarce, and less productive of
milk.  When meal, therefore, their chief support, is not
abundant, there is but little else to supply the deficiency; and
when it is very scarce, as happened in the year 1778, the
people are deeply distressed.-They sow in March, April,
and the beginning of May, and reap from tha 20th of August
to the 20th of October.  In 1782 and 1783, the crop failed,
and the people were in a very bad situation, till a supply of
meal, (which sold at a very high price), was brought from
Banss and Murray.

   Poor.-The number of poor, receiving alms, is about 60.
The funds for their supply are very trisling, consisting only of
a few halspence, collected on Sunday, and fines exacted from
delinquents: so that the Session cannot give them: at an ave-
rage, above 3 s. or 3 s 6 d at most, per annum, even to
the most distressed, and still less to others.  They are there-
fore principally supported by the generosity of the people at 
large; and a heavy burden it is.  The whole poor's funds do 
not exceed L. 7. L. 8. a year.
