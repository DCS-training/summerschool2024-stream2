     Statistical Account

   The channels of the river having now, however, been de-
termined by the lapse of time, and even, in some instances,
fixed down by the hand of man, these changes have at length
become less frequent, and less remarkable.  The accessions
of soil from the mountains have been gradually diminished
by the consolidation of their strata.  The streamlets that run
down from the hills have hollowed out a regular channel for
themselves.  In tracing their progress, we find that their ef-
fects are perceptible only as they approach the valleys;
whereas, towards their sources, near the summit of the
mountains, these are reduced almost to nothing.

   Rare Plants.-There are few districts, perhaps, of the
same extent, which present such a fertile field to the botanist
as Aberfoyle.  Besides the vegetables common to the lower
grounds, many of the rarer Alpine plants are to be found
upon the mountains.  Nor are the natives ignorant of the
medical uses of many of their vegetables.  A decoction of
the lichen pulmonarius is applied externally, with success, to
the cure of inflammations in the throat.  The roots of the
Angelica and meum are used as aromatics.  The tuffilago is
used in pulmonary complaints.  The roots of the orobus tu-
berosus, which abounds, are held in high esteem; and it is
imagined that their juice invigorates, and enables to resist
hunger for a long time.  To avoid prolixity, a list of some
of the rarer plants is subjoined in a note*.
