The boys frequently catch them for their amusement.
There are also occasional visits of the herrings.  These vi-
sits, however, are rare, having happened only thrice during
the present centure, viz. in the years 1718, 1753, and
1786, continuing commonly two or three seasons at each
visit.  No migratory birds are seen on this coast, except
those which are common to the whole island, unless some sea-
sowls of the duck kind are to be reckoned among the num-
ber.  When there happend to be a hard frost in the depth

As the two last winters have been very mild, there have
been few or none of these visitors.

   Popuation.-About the time that New Port-Glasgow

have been small.  Though the writer of this paper be not
possessed of materials, sufficient to enable him to ascertain,
with precision, what that number was, yet, from tradition-
al report, as well as from an old register of births and
marriages, now in his hands, it would seem, that, before
the commencement of the present century, the number of
inhabitants did not exceed 350, or 400 at most.  From the
year 1700 it gradually increased, till the year 1718, when
the present parish kirk was built.  At this last period, the
number of inhabitants could scarcely have amounted to
800, as the kirk can hardly contain that number.  From
the year 1718 it had, in like manner, gradually increased
till the year 1775, when the present incumbent was ordain-
ed.  If it be true, as is generally understood, that the po-
pulation of a parish may be known with sufficient accuracy,
by multiplying the number of births by 26, the state of
