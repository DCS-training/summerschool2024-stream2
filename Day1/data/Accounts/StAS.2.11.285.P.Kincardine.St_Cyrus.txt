the parish, and in the last of these years, the name of every indi-
vidual, with his place of residence, occupation, and age, is entered
in the minute-book of the kirk-session.
	The following table shows the state of the population from the
time of Dr Webster's account to 1841.

1755,              1271                     1801,               1622
1781,              1687                     1811,               1664
1785,              1704                     1821,               1641
1788,              1750                     1831,               1598
1792,              1763                     1841,               1600
1798,              1638

	The population appears to have remained nearly stationary
since the year 1798. The larger returns from 1781 to that year
are accounted for, by the circumstance of the lime-quarries of
Milton and Mathers being then in full operation, and the diminu-
tion in 1798, by the removal from the parish of a number of fa-
milies dependent on the prosecution of these works, which, about
that period, were partially, and not long after, entirely abandoned.
