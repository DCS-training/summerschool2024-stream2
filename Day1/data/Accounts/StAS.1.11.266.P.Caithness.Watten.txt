Proprietors may trim up and adorn a few acres, around their
own mansions, but it is only the judicious, diligent, persevering
efforts of the husbandman, which extends improvement, and
renders it beneficially lasting to the public at large.

   Method of Plowing.-Their yoke consists of 4 beasts;
horses, oxen, or cows, as they happen to have, or can afford
them, all going abreast, and drawing by theets.  One treads
constantly upon the tilled land, another goes in the furrow, and
two upon the stubble, or white land.  The person driving
walks backwards, holding the cattle tied with halters,
and taking care that each beast has its equal share of the
draught.  This, though most aukward to appearance, is a
method of yoking, by which the creatures evidently seem to
have most power.  Were they yoked in any other way, it does
not appear that they would be able to draw a plough, with
any thing like a furrow, after them.  One, not accustomed to
their manner, upon looking at their pitiful size, and lean con-
dition, would not think they were able, many of them, so far
to blacken a rig (raise a furrow), as to cover the seed: Yet
some of them will turn over the mould to the depth of about
4 inches; and it is surprising what good crops their shuffling
labour produces, both of bear and oats.  When the season is
dry, a part of the ground is plowed, after the corns are ga-
thered in, generally for the following bear crop.  During the
winter season, and the first month of spring, nothing without
doors is done.  The whole of their time is employed in
threshing down and manufacturing the crop.  As soon as the
weather sets in dry, and the land becomes fit for plowing,
which generally is not before the beginning or middle of
March, they are on the fields, labouring from morning to
night.  When once they begin, greater activity, or more per-
severance, is not to seen amongst any body of people. The
