     of Perth.

   At both Luncarty and Huntingtower, there is sometimes
in the throng of the season, above 60 Scots acres at each work
covered with linens.

   Leather Manufacture.-The manufacture of shoes and boots
is carried on here with great nicety, to the extent of at least
L. 8000 per annum, chiefly shipped for the London market.
   They prepare at the tan-works, from 4 to 5000 hides, and
about 500 dozen calf skins annually; and do business in tan-
ning to the extent of L. 10,000 sterling yearly.

   Paper Mills.-There are 3 mills for the manufacture of
paper in this neighbourhood, which contain at present 6
vatts; but are constructed, so as to admit of 9.
   These mills produce at present, from 9 to 10,000 reams of
writing and printing paper; and from 7 to 8000 blue; car-
tridge, brown, grey, and other packing papers, value above
L. 8000 sterling per annum; and increasing in value in pro-
portion to the quantity of fine paper manufactured.  This
manufactory, though only lately taken up by Morison and
Lindsay of this town, is allowed to produce uncommonly fine
writing paper, which is chiefly sent to the London market.

   Lintseed Oil.-The crushing of lintseed into oil, has been a
trade in this town and neighbourhood for many years past
but it is now on the decline: the first mill erected in Scot-
land for the above purpose, was at Huntingtower about 2
miles from this town.

   Salmon Fishing.-The salmon fishery on the Tay is very
extensive; and the rent considerably increased of late.  It
may be stated at L. 7000 sterling per annum; of which the
community of Perth draws above L. 1000 sterling of rent.
