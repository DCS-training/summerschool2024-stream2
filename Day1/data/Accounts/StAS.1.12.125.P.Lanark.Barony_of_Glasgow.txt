tween Forth and Clyde passes through part of this parish, as
does also that from Monkland.  The Forth and Clyde naviga-
tion was begun to be cut on the 10th of July 1768, and was
opened as far as Stockingfield in this parish, 10th July 1775;
a side-cut was brought forward to Hamilton-hill, November
1777, where a large bason was formed for the reception of
vessels, and large granaries and other buildings erected.  They
are now carrying forward this side-cut, in order to form a
junction with the Monkland Canal, which runs eastward
through this parish to the collieries in Monkland parish, and
extends to 12 miles in length.  On this side-cut, a new bason
is to be formed at Hundred Acre Hill in this parish, within
half a mile of Glasgow; here granaries, and other buildings
are to be erected, and a new village built, to be called Port-
Dundas.  The Canal was opened from sea to sea on the 29th
day of July 1790, and is carried over four aqueduct bridges
in this parish.  The great bridge over Kelvin was begun in June
1787, and finished in April 179 L.  It is carried over a valley
400 feet long, and 65 deep.  It consists of 4 very large ar-
ches of excellent mason work; is in height about 83 feet
from the bed of the river to the top of the bridge, and is one
of the most stupendous works of the kind perhaps in the
world.  The Canal is about 56 feet wide at the surface, and
27 feet at the bottom, is 8 feet deep, and admits vessels of 19
feet beam, and 68 feet keel.  On the Canal there are 5
locks in this parish, within the space of 200 yards, each lock
is 74 feet between the gates, and 20 between the walls.
There is also a very good dry dock for the vessels employed
upon the Canal.

the people, as yet, is that of sobriety and industry, though, from
