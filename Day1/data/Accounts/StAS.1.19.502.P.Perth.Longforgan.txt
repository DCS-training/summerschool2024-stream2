tion; so that, now, its value is already doubled, if not
more.
   About eighteen years ago, in the intermediate space be-
tween the bank of Forgan and the clay, there were about
20 acres of morassy ground, called the Laceh, so much im
pregnated with water, that in many places it arable, a
deep ditch was dug along the bottom of the brae-land, (ri-
sing ground), to cut off the springs from above, and the
space divided by cross ditches, with another between it and
the clay to carry off the water; and now the whole is fine
arable land, as good as any clay soil in the carse.  It was
let then at 5 s. per acre; it is now worth from 50 s. to
L. 3 per acre.

   Embanking.-The encroachments made by the river Tay
upon the Carfe, part of its boundaries, having made the pro-
prietors of these lands think of embanking for their defence,
the late Mr Crawford of Monorgan, who was the only heritor
in this parish whose lands were in danger, began to em-
bank about thirty years ago, and built stone-fences at a very
great expence; but being injudiciously constructed, and
built of bad materials, they have required repair almost e-
very year.  Now, since Monorgan has been annexed to the
estate of Caftle-Huntly, the proprietor has begun to em-
bank upon a new plan.  He has cut the earth into sloping
banks, falling to its greatest height at an angle, everywhere
much above 45o, and paving the whole extent of the flope
as far as the tide reaches, with good long stones, with their
ends inwards, and towards the land; so that the waves
wash over it, and, as they meet with no resistance, they do
no injury.  The expence of this is no doubt considerable,
but perhaps not much, if any thing, more than what has
been done by other carse proprietors along the banks of the
river, and bids fair to be infinitely more durable.  However
