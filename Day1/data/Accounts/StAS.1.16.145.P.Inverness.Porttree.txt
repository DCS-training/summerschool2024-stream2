     of Portree.

   With regard to the Roman Catholic chapels, no man
alive remembers to have seen any of them with a roof
on them; the walls are pretty entire.  One of them is in
Kirktown in Raasay, and is surrounded with a plantation of
trees.  In one of its windows are the bones of a man, ama-
zingly large, preserved by the inhabitants with a kind of
religious care, as a monument of the great strength and
size of their forefathers, though the present generation is
in these respects but little superior to their neighbours,
For the same reason they shew, about the middle of the
island, near the high road, a large round stone, which they
say Fobn Garbb, the foresaid chief, and one or two of his
people, used to list on their knees: Such is its weight, that
scarcely could the united strength of two of the stoutest men
now to be found in the country be able to raise it one inch
from the ground.  On the right hand, coming into Portree
between the towering cliffs above mentioned, and where
the fir was some time ago unsuccessfully planted, is a high
rock, washed at the foot in some places by the sea; on the
top of this rock is a beautiful plain, consisting of near 4
acres of good arable ground; and above it is a steep decli-
vity, almost equally high with the rock below.  Near the
west end of this plain is the other Roman Catholic chapel
formerly mentioned; and there, before Portree was erected
into a separate parish, and some time afterwards, was the
only burying ground in this end of the barony of Troter-
nish; but now, on account of its retired situation, it is al-
most entirely given up, a new place of interment being
marked out at the church of Portree, about 45 years ago,
where the whole people have at length begun to bury their
dead.  Down through the declivity two oblique paths
were made to the plain and chapel; and two others lead
from the shore, one at each end of the rock below.  In
different parts of the plain are springs of excellent water;
