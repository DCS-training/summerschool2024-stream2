Scotch; the real rent about 1000 l. Sterling, converting the
victual at 10 s. per boll.  Rent of acres is from 6 s. 8 d. to
20 s. Sterling.  Most of the farms have pasture grass, on
which they feed cattle.  The young store, the butter and
cheese they make from their cows, and the linen yarn spun
by the women to the manufacturers in Huntly, are the prin-
cipal funds for paying their rents.  Butter sells from 5 d. to
7 1/2 d. per pound; cheese at 4 s. and 5 s. per stone; and beef
and mutton at from 3 d. to 4 1/2 d. per pound.  Men's servants
wages run from 4 l. to 5 l. and some 6 l. per year; and wo-
men's wages, at an average, may be computed at 2 l. 5 s.-
Oats, barley, and a few pease, are the ordinary crops the
country produces; only, of late, some few have sown turnip,
and planted potatoes in the fields after the plough; and have,
with next crop, laid down clover and rye-grass, which have
succeeded very well.

   Church, Poor, and School.-The Duke of Gordon is patron.
The stipend is 36 bolls oat-meal, 16 bolls bear, and 46 l. 6 s.
8 d. Sterling of money, with a glebe of about 15 acres of
arable and grass ground.  The manse and office-houses were
built in 1772.  The church, which was quite ruinous, is this
year very sufficiently rebuilt.  There are only two heritors,
neither of whom reside.-There are few begging poor in the
parish, but several householders that are in indigent circum-
stances; and these, to the amount of between 30 and 40,
get such assistance as the funds will admit.  The collec-
tions in the church do not exceed 7 l. or 8 l. at most in the
year; but mortifications, to the extent of 150 l. Sterling,
help in part.-The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks.  There
were, this winter, 32 scholars at the school.
