   It is difficult to make out a state of the average actual re-
turns of the parish; so much depends upon the circumstances
of the times, and of the farmer's family, on his prudence and
attention and on the size of his farm, and the condition of
it, as to improvements that to make out a table of this sort
is to found much upon uncertainty.  Attention to general
facts and circumstances, may, however, be useful to give one
an average idea of farm charges, returns, and produce.  Two
methods may be used for computing the returns from a farm
in Wamphray, according to the present rates of things and
mode of management.  The first is the most comprehensive
method, viz.

     Debit the farm with

Men's labour, including all that labour on it, at 22 l. each,
board and wages.
Women, at 15 l. each, do.  do.
Boys at 12 l. do. do.
Keeping of each horse at 12 l.
Harness and shoeing of each at 1 l. 1 s.
Farm utensils, per year, for 70 l. rent, 5 l.
Incidental labour and charges on ditto, 3 l.
10 per cent. on all stocks and utensils to cover risk and wear.
Rent of the farm.
Twice a servant's board and wages, as allowance to the farmer.
