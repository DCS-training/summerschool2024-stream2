brought from a distance, chiefly from Mid-Lothian.  The
flour is chiefly furnished by the county of Fife, though there is
occasionally a supply from England.
   The flesh market is well supplied in all seasons, and the
consumption of butcher-meat very considerable, probably
three times what it was twenty years ago.  The average of
the number, weight, and value of the different kinds of cat-
tle which have been annually killed, and sold here for some
years, is as follows.

   Of this quantity, a full third goes into the consumption of
the neighbouring parishes: About 700 stones are bought for
sea-stones, by the shipmasters of the place; whose principal
supplies of salt-beef are from Ireland: The remainder (about
12.530 stones tron; or 275.660 lib. English), is consumed in
the parish; and is nearly in the proportion of 4 stones, 11 lib.
or 103 lib.  English, to every man, woman, and child in it.
   The supply of fish is lessened, and the price raised, by the
nearness of the metropolis.  There are no fishers that belong
to this parish: About the beginning of summer, a family or
two usually come from Buck-haven, the principal fishing
station on the south coast of Fife, and reside here for a few
months, for the convenience of supplying the inhabitants.
But the chief supply is carried from Buck-haven and Wemyss,
