     of Ardnamurchan.

Salen, a creek of Loch Sunart, to the west end of Loch
Sheil, extend, in one range, from east to west; the others,
in Inverness-shire, lie parallel to each other and to Sunart,
from which Moidart is separated by the above lake; the ri-
ver Sheil, being the boundary between the north-east cor-
ner of Ardnamurchan, and south-west of Moidart, for about
three miles, to its fall into the sea at Castle Tioram.
Straight lines drawn between the extreme points, would
form the parish into a figure of four unequal sides, the south
being the longest, the north shortest, and the west exceed-
ing the east side.  From the above calculations, the best that,
for want of surveys of half the parish, could be made, it
may be reduced to a square of something more than 20
English miles of land and water, extending to 273,280
acres; of which, it is believed, above 200,000 are land.

   Surface, Soil, etc-Of so large a space, a minute descrip-
tion will not be expected.  It consists, principally, of moun-
tains, hills, and high moors, in general more rugged and
precipitous than of great elevation; the highest, being only
of the third or fourth rate among the Highland mountains,
i. e. probably not exceeding, in any instance, 1000 yards;
a height which four or five of them seem to approach.
There are certainly many, in all the gradations, from 400
to 900 yards.  They are in general pointed at top, though
none can be called regular cones*.
