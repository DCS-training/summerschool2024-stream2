   Climate, Diseases, and Longevity.-In the carse, intermittent
fevers were very frequent some time ago, occasioned, princi-
pally, by the dampness of the country; but since the ground
has been drained, and the inhabitants are more comfortably
lodged and fed, all distempers, arising from a relaxed habit,
are neither so common nor severe.-There is nothing extra-
ordinary in the stature or longevity of the people.  About
the beginning of 1794, there died in the carse a person aged
93.  Several persons, now alive, enjoy good health at the
age of 80.  The people in general are healthy and hardy,
inured, from their infancy, to the laborious exercises of agri-
culture, which, by their improved stile of living, they are
not only enabled to undergo with success, but with comfort
and ease.

   Produce, etc.-The produce is wheat, barley, oats, pease,
beans, clover, and rye-grass; and in up-lands less wheat and
beans, but in their place more turnips, flax, and potatoes of
various kinds.-The wheat is sown in the latter end of Sep-
tember, and during the whole month of October, usually af-
ter summer fallow.  The farmers begin to low pease and
beans in February, and oats as early in March as the season
will allow.  The sowing of barley is generally finished by
the 1st of May.  Potatoes are planted about the middle of
May, which is also the season for the barley seed time in the
up-land.  The turnips are sown in June.  The wheat yields
about 10 bolls an acre, having 8 or 10 chalders of lime laid
on the preceding fallow.  The harvest begins about the mid-
dle of August, and is finished in 6 weeks thereafter, when the
season is favourable.  The wheat sells generally at 21 s. and
sometimes more, by the boll; the barley from 18 s. to 22 s.;
meal commonly at 16 s.  The barley is sometimes sown by
itself, and sometimes mixed with Chester bear.  The oats,
