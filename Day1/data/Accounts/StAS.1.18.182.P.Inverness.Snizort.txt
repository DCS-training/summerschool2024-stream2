     Statistical Account

several valleys, or, as we call them, glens; yet there are some
fields pretty extensive, level and arable.  The land as well as
the soil is various.  The land for the most part is thin and
dry, with some hanging and spouty ground; and the soil
poor, light, and gravelly; and yields no produce, unless it is
laid over with a thick coat of manure.  In the north part,
and in a few spots in the west, the land is deeper, and the
soil more fertile; and in the east side of the parish, the land
is in general deep, and clay.  The quantity of arable ground
has never been ascertained; but by far the greater part of
this district consists of uncultivated lands, overgrown with
heath and heather; of moor and moss; of hills and moun-
tains, a few of which, are green and dry to the top; the
greater number however, are wet and heathy.  There is a
ridge of very high mountains, steep and rocky on that side
facing the east, running from south to north, and separating
the east part of this district of the barony of Trotornish from
the west.
   The principal crops in the parish, are oats and potatoes.
When the seasons are favourable, such a quantity of each, as
is necessary for the maintenance of its inhabitants, is raised
within the bounds of the parish; but when unfavourable,
which more frequently happens to be the case, there is a ge-
neral demand for imported meal.  The seed time is from
about the 20th of March, to near the middle of May.  The
harvest seldom begins before the middle of September, and
often not till October; and the crop is rarely got totally into
the barn-yards, before the beginning of November, and fre-
quently much later; the late harvests are generally bad, and
always precarious in this country; from the lateness as well
as from the uncertainty of the seasons, this district, and in-
deed most of the island, seems calculated by nature, more
for grazing and green pasture, than for raising corn.
