     Statistical Account of the

sensible, that, four nations, only, being at first admitted into
the University of Paris, the Scots were placed next to the
French, properly so called, and above the Picards and Nor-
mans.  It appears that, so long ago as the reign of King
Malcom IV. there existed at Old Aberdeen a Studium gene-
rale in Collegio Canonicorum Aderdonensium; where there were
professors and doctors, both of Divinity, and of Canon and
Civil Laws.  This Collegium Canonicum was instituted by Ed-
ward bishop of Aberdeen, anno 1157, soon after the episco-
pal fee had been translated from Mortlach; and subsisted as
we find in Hector Boece's lives of the bishops of Aberdeen,
until the foundation of the College by Bishop Elphinston.

   Institution of the University, etc.-In the year 1494, Pope
Alexander VI. by a Bull dated at Rome, February 10th, in-
stituted in the city of Old Aberdeen, or Aberden, as it is there
called, an University, or Studium generale et Universitas Studii
generalis, for Theology, Canon and Civil Laws, Medicine,
the liberal arts, and every other lawful faculty in it, eccle-
siastics laics, masters and doctors, are appointed to read,
and teach those who come to pursue their studies, from what
parts soever, in like manner as in other privileged Universi-
ties.  It is farther appointed, that the students, according to
merit, shall receive the degrees of Baccalaureat, Licentiate,
Master and Doctor; and powers of granting the same are
specially conferred.  With these degrees are bestowed all the
privileges, pre-eminencies, liberties, exemptions, favours and
indulgencies, which are known to belong to any other Uni-
versity; and that, not only within this, but every other Uni-
versity, ubicunque terrarum, without any farther examination.
Lastly, it is appointed, that William Elphinston, then bishop
of Aberdeen, and his successors in office, should be chancel-
lors of the University, and sole judges in all causes criminal
