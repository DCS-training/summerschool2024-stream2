When it does, it is often as high as 8 d. the lb.  These 3 
rivers all abound in excellent trout, but particularly the
Wauchope.  Those in the Tarrass are larger than in the 
other rivers.  The Wauchope and Tarrass trout are of a 
more delicate flavour than those either of the Esk or the
Ewes.  No district in the S. of Scotland affords more a-
musement to a sportsman, either for fishing or fowling,
than Langholm.

   Woods.-After what has already been said in the prece-
ding pages with regard to the extent of wood in this parish,
it is only necessary to add, that it consists of some very ve-
nerable and valuable oaks, ash, birch, alder, and a variety
of other trees, with which it is intermixed, such as beech
and firs of all kinds, which are thriving, and adding much
to the natural beauties of the place.  There is a species of
the fallow, known here by the name of the gray saugh,
which grows to a large size, and is much prized by cabinet
makers for its beautiful red colour, and the fine polish it is
capable of receiving when applied to domestick purposes.
The copse is finely diversified by a profusion of wild rasps,
strawberries, blue (or blae) berries, etc, etc.  The Dean
banks (through which the post road passes along the W.
side of the Elk) and the woods of Broomholm on the op-
posite side, form a fine forest, consisting of many valuable, 
well as beautiful trees.

   Poor, etc.-The annual average of paupers in Langholm
is about 35.  The poor-rates* were instituted in this, and
