     Statistical Account

   The most essential improvement of this part of the coun-
try would be to inclose the grounds with broad belts of
planting for shelter.  The village of Carnwath (many parts
of the parish are higher is no less than 650 feet above the
level of the sea; it may therefore be easily judged that shelter
is absolutely necessary.  This district ought to be made a graz-
ing rather than a corn country, the spring season being un-
commonly wet, so that the lands are seldom in a proper con-
dition when they are sown, and the frosts come on so early,
that they often hurt, and sometimes almost destroy the crop.
The fatal effects of these frosts are so justly and distinctly des-
cribed in the Statistical Account of the parish of Linton in
Tweeddale, as to render it unnecessary to say more on the
subject.  From the causes now mentioned, there has scarce
been a crop in the muirland part of this parish since 1783,
which has repaid the farmer for seed and labour, and in
many of these years his returns have by no means done so.
Were the fields inclosed in the manner mentioned above, and
laid down in good heart into grass, few parts of the country
would produce more or better, and were these fields plough-
ed only after lying 6, 7, or 8 years in pasture, the produce
of one acre might well be computed equal to the produce of
two in the general mode of farming at present.  There is
plenty of limestone in the middle of the parish, and a seam
of coal immediately under it, sufficient to burn the stone: It
is sold at 5 1/2 d. per boll slacked lime.  To have this ma-
terial so near at hand is certainly of advantage for the im-
provement of the district.  It is found that laying lime upon
lands which produce sour coarse grass, sweetens it much,
and increaseth the quantity.  As Carnwath is situated at a
little distance from an wool country (Tweeddale), fuel cheap,
and the houses low rented, it would be a proper place for es-
