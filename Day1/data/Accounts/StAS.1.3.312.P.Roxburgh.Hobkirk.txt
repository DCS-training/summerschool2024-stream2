summit, you have a view of both east and west seas, though
both are at the distance of 40 miles.  The parish abounds
with free stone.  Beyond Winbrough there are very good
lime stone quarries, and three lime kilns; two of them upon
the lands of Sir Francis Elliot of Stobs, and another upon
the lands of Mr Elliot of Harrot.  A little below the last
mentioned lime kiln, there is a place called Robert's Linn,
where there are large rocks of pebbles, of which are made
feals and buttons of different kinds.  Most of the rock is of
a light blue colour.  There are other parts of it finely varie-
gated with strokes of red and yellow; and so much are
they esteemed, that great quantities are carried as far as
Sheffield and Birmingham.
