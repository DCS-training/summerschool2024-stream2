ter a great deal of innocent mirth and pleasntry, the creel
falls at length to the young husband's share, who is obliged to
carry it generally for a long time, none of the young women
having compassion upon him.  At last, his fair mate, kind-
ly relieves him from his burden; and her complaisance, in
this particular, is considered as a proof of her satisfaction
with the choice she has made.  The creel goes round again;
more merriment succeeds, and all the company dine together,
and talk over the seats of the field*.

   Church, Manse, Stipend, and Patron.-The church is an-
tient, probably built before the  Reformation.  The manse was
built in 1727; but has since been frequently repaired.  The
stipend is 8 chalders, or 12.8 bolls of meal, and about L. 8 in
money, with a glebe.  The living was the same 100 years a-
go.  Miss Scot is patron.

   State of the Poor.-The collections for the poor, with the
interest of a small sum of money, bring in about L. 40. per an-
num, which is distributed among two classes.  The first class con-
sists of the old, the infirm, young children, orphans, etc. who
have a weekly pension.  Such as are rendered unfit, by tem-
porary sickness, to provide for themselves and families, re-
ceive only an occasional or interim supply.
   The Session takes an inventory of the goods of such as have
a weekly provision which, at their death, are sold for the be-
hoof of the poor.-Intimation is given from the pulpit
from time to time, to let no houses to any person who is like-
ly to be a burden on the parish.  There are no native beggars,
but too many of that description from other parishes.  The

Perhaps the French phrase, "Adieu panniers, vendauge;
" sont sailes," may allude to a similar custom.
