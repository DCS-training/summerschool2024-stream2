road leads directly cross the little, but occasionally rapid ri-
ver or burn of Ski-ak, through the farms of Upper and
Lower Achmores*, that of Edra-chalda, cross the small river
of Chalda, then through the farm of Culin and Half Ca-
more+; here, about the eastern end of Loch-Assint, are the
parochial kirk and manse.  The way thence leads cross
the river Tralegal, which, at a little distance enters Loch-
Assint, then through the farms of Inch-nadaff, Sronchruby,
and Laing, cross A-na-ka-un river, by Ry-an-cro-vich farm,
thence, advancing a little, there is a path which strikes off
for Leadbeg farm-house, but the public road is continued to
Auldan-nakal-gach++; the farms from thence westward (in
the direction of Cloich-glas maul-a-chirn, etc. formerly de-
scribed), and lying within that line of march, are Ledmore,
Cromauld, Auld-an achy, Alpine, and Knock^^.  The nar-
rator having now faithfully mentioned every particular
farm and inhabited place, the manner they are situated
along shore, and how they lie in the inland tracks, he leaves
the consideration and decision respecting public roads to the
Honourable Commissioners of the county; only adding,
that if these roads were begun and finished, bridges built,
and regular stages fixed, probably no less curious and use-

*Upper Tubeg is adjoined to Inisnadaff farm, Lower Tubeg to Stron-
chouby farm.

   +From the principal road a track or path strikes off by Achmore farm-
house for Unpool farm, which is the eastern end of Slichachilish.

   ++ The other half of Camore is the minister's glebe.

   ^^The unfortunate person, by whole single evidence (in time of the
clan conflicts) the grazings or farms of Auldy-vulin, Auldan-farn.  Strath-
ses-kach, Knock-kurny, and Glas-wel, with all parts and pendicles, were
severed from Assint, is handed down to this very day as having land violent
hands on himself.  I had limb once of this parish was sweeped away when
the intrepid lairds of Macleod held all the parish.

   ^There is a tract on bad road from Knochan to the village of Ula-pool
