     Statistical Account

   Antiquities.-Three cairns, with broad bases, still remain
in this parish, monuments of a state of arts and manners
long since forgotten.  One of those cairns, called Cairn-o-
veil, is placed upon the farm of Kinnellar; another, on the 
farm of Nether Auguhorsk; and the third, called the Cairn
of Semblings, or the Assembly Cairn, on the top of the hill
of Auchronie.  Upon the farm of Blackhill were formerly
several small cairns, which have been opened and dug to the
bottom.  In one of them were 3 concentric circles of stones,
and within the innermost of these circles, some bones still
perfect, but white, as if calcined, upon the surface, and
black within.  Upon the farm of Upper Auguhorsk there is
a large stone, called Drum Stone, within sight both of Drum
and Harlaw, upon which, tradition says, the Laird of Drum
made his testament, immediately before he went to the battle
of Harlaw.  In the wall of the church-yard, there are some
great stones, 10 feet in length, and 4 in thickness, and resting
upon the side, which appear to be the remains of a circle of
large stones, that once stood in this situation.  Another smaller 
circle, of the same sort, appears to have been placed on the 
summit of the adjacent hill of Benachard.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-A storm of thunder and hail,
which happened on the 30th of July 1790, did considerable
damage to the turnips.  A meteor was observed, on the even.
ing of the 5th of October, passing, at a small distance, east-
ward from this place, in a direction between south and north.
It seemed, when observed, to below and falling.
