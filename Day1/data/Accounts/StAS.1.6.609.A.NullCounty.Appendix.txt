   In 1763-It was the fashion for gentlemen to attend the
drawing rooms of the ladies in the afternoons, to drink tea,
and to mix in the society and conversation of the women.
   In 1783-The drawing-rooms were totally deserted; invi-
tations to tea in the afternoon were given up; and the only op-
portunity gentlemen had of being in ladies company, was
when they happened to mess together at dinner or supper; and
even then, an impatience was sometimes shewn, till the ladies
retired.  Card parties, after a long dinner;-and also after 2
kite supper were frequent.
   In 1763-It was fashionable to go to church, and people
were interested about religion.  Sunday was strictly observed
by all ranks as a day of devotion; and it was disgraceful to be
seen on the streets during the time of public worship.  Fami-
lies attended church, with their children and servants; and
family worship was frequent.  The collections at the church
doors, for the poor, amounted yearly to L. 1500, and neglected,
and particularly by the men; Sunday was by many made
a day of relaxation; and young people were allowed to stroll about
at all hours.  Families thought it augenteel to take their do-
mestics to church with them:  The streets were far from being 
void of people in the time of public worship; and, in the evenings
were frequently loose and riotous; particularly owing to bands
of apprentices boys, and young lads.  Family worship was almost
disused.  The collections at the church doors for the poor 
had fallen to L. 1000.
   In 1791-The collections at the church doors had risen to
L.1200*.
