still continue.  There, is, however, a good fund; the inte-
rest of which, together with the collections at the church
doors, should be sufficient, with a little assistance, to supply
the poor of the parish.  But the opulent, who do not chuse to
attend divine service, should send their mite regularly to
the poor; otherwise people of inferior rank, may be temp-
ted to imitate their example, not in absenting themselves
from the church, but in with-holding their contributions.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is no regular market
here, though butcher-meat can be had occasionally.-
The average price of oat-meal, for some years past, has been
1 s. per peck;-potatoes 8 d. (double the measure of Edin-
burgh);-mutton from 5 d. to 8 d. per pound;-beef from
5 d. to 8 d.- and hens 3 s. a pair.  Servants and day-labourers
wages are very high.  There are men now living, who,
when young, thought L. 2: 10 a year, great wages; and
now, a hired servant by the year gets L. 10.  Women remem-
ber, when they thought L. 1: 10 a year, great wages; and
now they are L. 2 a half year.  Day-labourers now alive,
have wrought for 5 d. and 6 d. a day.  Day-labourers are
now scarce, and not to be got under 1 s. 6 d. a day; and at
this moment, women are receiving 1 s. 4 d. a day, and 1 s. a day,
and their victuals.-Thirty or forty years ago, dung was
got for 6d. and 8d. a cart, and the proprietors courted the
farmer to take it away.  The farmer, with difficulty, can
now procure it at 2 s. 6 d. and makes interest to purchase it
at that price.-Horses, that some years ago were thought
extravagantly high at L. 18, now bring L. 30 and L. 35.
   All the parish is inclosed, and the farmers are abundantly
sensible of the benefit of inclosures.-The character of
the people, is, on the whole, respectable.  Many of them
