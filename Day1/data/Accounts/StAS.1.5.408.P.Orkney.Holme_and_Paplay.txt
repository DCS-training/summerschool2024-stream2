which more than supplies the demands of the parishioners;
and the surplus is transferred to the burgh of Kirkwall,
mostly in malt, being the kind of rent the farmers are
obliged to pay to the superior and landmaster.  There is 
likewise an inferior kind of grey oats, of a lean quality, of
which is made a weak but wholesome meal, not exceeding
the demands of the parish.  No other grain is propaga-

docet.-The usual time of sowing oats is from the begin-
ning of March, and of big from the beginning of May,
both O. S. and they are usually reaped in September.
This parish has been in the practice of sowing flax-feed
for 100 years back, and for the last 30 years to a very
considerable extent; by their manufacturing whereof, their
domestic requisites are furnished completely, and no contemp-
tible quantity is sent annually to the east coast of England.
The common grift of the cloth is from 900 to 1200, and
some have exceeded 1800.  By an accurate account, taken
for several years previous to the 1787, there were upwards
of 20,000 yards manufactured and bleached yearly in this

May, and pulled after the middle of August.  Since the year
1765, (when the crop was blasted by a hurricane on the 7th
of August, over the whole of this county), potatoes have
been introduced and propagated with much success; and 
every individual now shares in this public benefit.  They
are planted in the end of April after the plough,
and raised about the end of August.  The climate and soil
is peculiarly favourably for cabbages, both in gardens
and in the fields, although in the latter not so common.
They stand out the severity of winter, and are whole-
some and firm in April.  The seed is sown in June, in a 
small pennorbught, and the plants are transplanted into the
gardens, in the March following, and into the fields about
