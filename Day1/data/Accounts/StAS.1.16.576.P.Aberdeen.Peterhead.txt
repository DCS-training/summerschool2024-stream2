ounces English, being the ancient Scotch trone pound;
chee e from 3 s. to 5 s. the stone, 20 lb. Dutch each stone.
I know of three cows for several weeks one summer,
yielding each of them daily 1 lb. of butter, 16 ounces
Dutch each pound; and of one cow, which calved about
Christmas, yielding 11 lb. of butter in five days, the pound
consisting of 16 ounces; she gave from 8 to 9 pints of
milk, and was fed with hay and cabbage.  A farmer, who
has an extensive farm, and is very attentive to his dairy,
informs me, that with good management "A cow will,
"during the summer, be worth about L. 5 Sterling.  I
"have seven cows, which give about 8 pints of milk each
"day, and yield me profit in that proportion."

   Leases.-The leases are in general for 19 years; some for
that period, and the life of the tenant; there are a few for
two or three nineteen years, with one or two lives.  On
the farms, which have the longest leases, the lands are in
the highest state of cultivation.

   Planting.-There is very little planting in the parish.
There are some trees at Invernettie and Little Cocklaw
some young timber at Alehousehill, Blackhouse, and
Grange.  At the manse, within 200 or 300 yards of the
sea, there is a thriving plantation of elder and willows
lately raised.  I should not have mentioned this trifling
circumstance if I had any merit in raising the plantation;
last year there was a shoot of elder, the growth of the sum-
mer, of five feet in length.  It would add much to the or-
nament of this country, if heritors would be at some pains
in raising such trees as are suited to the climate; formerly
there were large forests in the parish.
