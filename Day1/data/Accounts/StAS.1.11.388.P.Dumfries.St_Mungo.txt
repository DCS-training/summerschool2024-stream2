port of a teacher.  Proper measures are now taking to reme-
dy this shameful defect.

   Poor.-The number of persons receiving alms from the
parish does not at present exceed 8; though it is sometimes
greatly more.  They are supported by the collections at the
church, and by the charity of their neighbours.  Though
none of them are permitted to beg from house to house, yet
we are greatly molested with vagrants from other parishes.
Some wise regulations, obliging the poor to content them-
selves with seeking charity within the bounds of their re-
spective parishes, were lately adopted by the justices of the
peace, and had for a time a salutary effect.  The officers
however, have become more remiss in enforcing these regula-
tions, and vagrants are nearly as numerous as before.

   Proprietors, Rents, Improvements, etc.-There is one con-
siderable proprietor, and about 19 others, who all reside, ex-
cept two or three.  One half of them possess their whole pro-
perty themselves.  The annual real rent is about 1800 L.
Sterling, and the valued rent 2285 merks Scotch.  The farms
are in general let from 20 L. to 80 L. per annum; and a few as
low as 10 L.  About the year 1769, a spirit of improvement
was introduced into the parish, the good effects of which are
visible, in the substantial farm houses, enclosures, domestic
economy, and the general appearance of the inhabitants.
The whole parish is now enclosed, and the commons are un-
der cultivation, which must, in a few years, greatly increase
both the rent and the number of inhabitants.  The greatest
part of the parish is thirled to the mill of Castlemilk, and
pays, of multure, nearly a 9th part of the whole; which is a
very heavy drawback on the improvement of the country.
