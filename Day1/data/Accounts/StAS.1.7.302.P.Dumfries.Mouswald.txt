   Advantages and Disadvantages.-One great advantage which
the tenants of the Duke of Queensberry enjoy, is, that they
have got leases for 19 years, and are freed from all public
burdens whatever, road-money excepted, which they pay in
lieu of the statute labour formerly exacted; and have all their
farms, (most of which, in former tacks, lay run-ridge), now
laid by themselves, and are setting about inclosing them with,
ditch and hedge at their own expence.  Some are already
inclosed and subdivided, so sensible are they of the benefit of
inclosing.  All the tenants in the parish have been so fully
satisfied of this, that they have been for several years past
willing to pay 5 per cent. to their landlords for money to lay
out in this way.  Another advantage they enjoy is good
roads, and the easy access they have to lime from the parishes
of Cummertrees and Ruthwell, (the latter quarry discovered
and wrought only about 13 years ago), and the ready mar-
ket they find at Dumfries for every article they can spare.
The lime at these places is Sold at 11 d. the Carlisle bushel,
containing 3 of Winchester, 4 bushels making an ordinary
single cart-load.  It might be sold lower, were it not for the
high duty laid on English coals brought across the Frith,
which duty is heavily felt, and is a great discouragement
both to agriculture and manufactures.  The thirlage to the
two mills is light and easy.  Some of the tenants 1. the pa-
rish, however, have still various services exacted from them;
and tacks only for 9 years, both which are certainly great
discouragements to improvement.
