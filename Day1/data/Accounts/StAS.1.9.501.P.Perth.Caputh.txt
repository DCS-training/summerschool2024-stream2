   Rent of a house and garden, L. 1. The garden, which the man dresses
in the mornings and evening, affords the family cabbages, greens, and
potatoes, to the amount of the rent. Fuel costs 105; but after dung

ground (given by the farmer) as produces potatoes worthg 10 s.

     No.II.

youngest an infant.
   They have an acre of land, grass for a cow, and a house and garden;
rent, at an average, L. 2, 10 s  The eldest boy or girl earns for itself,
by keeping cattle. The acre of land, &c. enables this family to gain
I. 1 more a-year than No. 1. They have, therefore, L. 4:9:4 for
defraying annual expenses.
