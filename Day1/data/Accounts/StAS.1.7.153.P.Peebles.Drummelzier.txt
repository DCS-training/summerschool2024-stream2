     NUMBER XIV.

     PARISH OF DRUMMELZIER.

     (County of Tweedale.-Presbytery of Peebles.-Synod of
     Lothian and Tweedale.)

     By the Reverend Mr WILLIAM WELSH.

     Name, Soil, and Climate.
   THE antient and modern name of this parish is the
same, and is said to signify, in the Gaelic, "Here is
a plain," which accords very well with the situation of the
village that is built on a rivulet called Pow Sail, at the head
of a haugh of about 300 acres of inclosed land, divided into
sixteen parks, in grass, rented about 20 s. per acre; 30 years
ago, uninclosed, they set at 7 s. per acre.  The parish is 12
miles long, and, at an average, about 3 broad.  The face of
the country is beautifully varied with hill and rock, rivulets
and small plains, lying on the Tweed.  The soil is light, but
fertile.  The air is healthy.  The most frequent diseases are,
slow fevers, consumptions, and rheumatisms.  There are no
fish but trout and salmon.
