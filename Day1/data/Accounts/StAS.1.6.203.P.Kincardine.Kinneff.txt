and light soils, after being dressed in a similar manner, carry
good crops of turnips, barley or bear, oats, pease, and grass.

   Produce.-Crops of wheat yield from 40 to 50 Winchester
bushels per acre; and the subsequent crops of beans, barley,
or bear, on strong land, produce nearly the same quantity.
On the higher grounds and light soils, the first crops of oats
and bear, after thorough dressing, are nearly the same in quan-
tity with those already mentioned.-It may farther be remark-
ed, that the best and most experienced farmers are of opini-
on, that it is for their interest to have at least one-half of their
arable land (or perhaps more) in fallow, grass, and green crop.
-All the farmers raise turnips for their cows and young cat-
tle; and they in general are of opinion, that this is a more
profitable way of using turnips than to feed cattle for the butch-
er.  Cabbages in the field have been tried; but cattle always
prefer turnips when they can get them.  The only advantage
of cabbage is, that in time of very deep snow, or hard frost,
they may be got when turnips cannot be had.
   From the account given of the number of inhabitants, the
mode of cultivation, and the returns the land makes, it is evi-
dent the farmers raise much more grain, and many more black-
cattle, than can be consumed in the parish.  What grain and
meal are sold from the middle and south part of the county, find
in general a ready market at Berrie, Johnshaven, and Mon-
trose; being sent from these places by the canal to the west
country.  The farmers have, for some years past, regretted the
failure of the Firth distillers, as the great consumers of their
bear and barley.  The north part of the parish and county,
send what grain they have to spare to Stonehaven and Aber-
deen.  The parish may annually export about 4500 bolls of
grain, and about 300 black-cattle.-Several attempts have been
