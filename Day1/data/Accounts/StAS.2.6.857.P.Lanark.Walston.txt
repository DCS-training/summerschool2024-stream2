so held by them till the Reformation.  In Bagimont's Roll, the
Vicarage of Walston, in the Deanery of Lanark, is taxed at L. 2,
13s. 4d., being a tenth of the estimated value of the spiritual re-
venues.  At the Reformation, the rectorial revenues were let to
the parishioners for L. 40 yearly, and it was reported by Sir Da-
vid Dalgleish, who then held the vicarage, that its revenues were let
for 50 merks yearly payable to him, and 20 merks more, payable
to Lawrence Leschman,-a minister who bad been placed in the
church of Walston by the Reformers.  The rectorial revenues
were afterwards granted to the College of Glasgow. *  In 1708,
the stipend, on an average of years, did not not exceed 600 merks.
In 1755, it amounted to L. 58, 5s.; in 1798, to L. 77, 16s. 6d.
   Ministers of Walston.-Robert de Lamberton, rector of the
church of Walston, swore fealty to Edward L in 1296, and there-
upon obtained a mandate for the delivery of his property.  He
held the benefice during his life.  In 1502, Mr Edward Sinclair
obtained a presentation from the King to the vicarage of Walston,
which was vacant by the decease of Mr William Crichtoun.  How
the presentation came to be with the King does not appear. + He
was succeeded by Sir David Dalgleish and Lawrence Leschman al-
ready mentioned.  On the death of Sir David Dalgleish, Walter
Tweedie was presented, (20th May 1567,) by James Earl of Bothwell,
the patron, to the vicarage of the parish church of Walston; but
Bothwell being denounced a rebel before his collation, he obtained
a grant of the benefice from the Regent Murray in September 1567. ++
In the "Register of ministers in Clydesdale sen 1567," we find at Wal-
ston John Fotheringham, exhorter, xl merkis; Thomas Lindsay,
exhorter, xl merkis.  Thomas Lindsay is, in 1576, found as mi-
nister with a stipend of L. 66, 13s. 4d., and Robert Kinross,
reader, with L. 16.  Thomas Lindsay, as appears from his tomb-
stone in the churchyard, died minister of Walston, 17th June
1609, and was succeeded by his son Thomas Lindsay, who died
in 1654.  Patrick Anderson was inducted in 1655 and ejected.
for non-conformity in 1663.  In September, 1672, he was ordered
by the council, under the Act of Indulgence, to repair to the parish
of Kilbirnie, and there to remain confined, with permission to
preach and to exercise the other parts of his ministerial function,-
which order he did not obey.  In 1673,he was called before the
council, and ordered to his confinement betwixt and the 1st of
