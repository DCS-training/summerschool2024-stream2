	ters per acre, and of wheat from six to seven quarters per acre.
	He commenced liming in 1829 and manuring in 1835, the rota-
	tion up to that period being potatoes, and wheat or oats alternate-
	ly.  In 1833, Sir John Richardson reclaimed 18 acres more at an
	expense of L. 1200; and by means of head-dikes, breakwaters,
	&c., which he is from time to time throwing out in the river for the
	purpose of accumulating silt, upwards of 150 acres more may ul-
	timately be added to the parish; of these from 15 to 20 may be
	banked off in the course of two years.  It is worthy of being men-
	tioned here, that Sir John, in a paper on his Embankments, read	before the Highland Society, and for which be received the So-
	ciety's medal, states, " that if various conflicting interests could be
	reconciled, there would be added to the Carse of Gowrie a tract
	of land equally rich with that which has been described, and extend-
	ing to many thousands of acres."  He adds, " This scheme was ori-
ginally suggested by my grandfather forty years ago, and I trust
	that before another forty years are gone, the now barren sand-banks
	of the, estuary of the Tay may be converted into fertile fields."
	   Fishings.-The oniv fishing carried on here is the salmon, the
	right to which belongs solely to Sir John Richardson.  The an-
	nual rent is estimated at about L. 1000.

	   The valued rent of the parish is L. 1300 Scots.  The real rent
	is about L. 4000 Sterling.
	   Manufactures.-The only branch of manufacture carried on in
	the parish is that of linen and coarse canvass, the flax and hemp
	being supplied to hand-loom weavers by Dundee merbhants, who
	pay so much per web for weaving.  The number of these weavers
	does not exceed a dozen, and their labours at the loom are con-
	fined to the winter months, as they prefer being employed at the
	salmon-fishery during the rest of the year.
