Weymouth, or New England pine, seems much more de-
licate, and does not attain to any great size.  The spruce
fir, when young, grows fast, from its conical figure, makes
an excellent nurse to hard wood trees, but appears short
lived, as here, even in the most favourable situations, when
about 40 years old, it begins to die at top, and quickly-
decays.  In planting the larix, which is now so justly va-
lued, there generally prevails what appears an error.  It
is commonly planted out from a foot to 18 inches, or more
in height, with feedling, Scotch, or spruce firs as nurses, grow-
ing much faster than either, its tender shoots are always
exposed to the violence of the storm, and much waved by
the wind.  It might perhaps succeed as well to plant the
nurses 3, 4, or even 5 years before, by which time, ha-
ving attained some size, they would be a better shelter to
the larix; there seems no danger of this being smothered
by the others, as no tree grows better in the shade, and by
consequence it answer well for filling up wants in planta-
tions.  The enclosures here are generally let from years to
year in pasture, and in that way yield perhaps and higher
rent than they would do in tillage.  There are in the pa-
rish a few enclosures, and some plantations belonging to
Mr Carmichael of Eastend.  Lord Douglas has also enclo-
sed a bill, containing near 300 acres, to be planted next
season, which, when grown, will be an ornament to the
country, being seen in several directions at a great di-
stance.

   Agriculture.-Agricultural is for the most part carried
on in the old manner.  The division into croft and outfield
is generally retained.  Formerly the croft was kept con-
stantly in crop, by which, particularly in wet seasons, the
crops, though bulky, being much filled with weeds, yield-
ed little good grain.  Convinced of the impropriety of this
