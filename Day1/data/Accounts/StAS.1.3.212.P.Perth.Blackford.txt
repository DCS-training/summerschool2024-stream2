     Statistical Account

   The women are the only manufacturers in this parish.
From the flax that is raised in it, they spin a good deal of
linen yarn, and make many pieces of coarse linen cloth for
sale; and, by their industry, raise a part of the rent that is
paid to the landlord.

   The roads in the district are naturally good, owing to the
gravelly soil.  They are easily kept up, and till lately, this
was done by the statute labour, which was very ill perform-
ed.  They have now fallen into the method of commuting
the statute labour for money, at the rate from 8 s. to 12 s. each
plough; and little tenants and cottagers are charged such small
sum; as they are able to pay.  Within these few years, bridges
have been thrown over several rivulets which come from the
Ochils, and in floods were very troublesome to travellers.
These were mostly built at the expence of the county.  The
late.  Sir William Moncrieff received L. 30 from the county
run with which he built three very necessary bridges at
Blackford.
