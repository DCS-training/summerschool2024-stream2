   Stipend, School, Poor, &c.-The church is an old
building, without any date.  It was repaired in 1789,
and is now a decent and comfortable place of worship.
The manse was built in 1739, and repaired in 1769.
The Stipend consists of 4 bolls wheat, 67 meal, 41 bar-
ley, and 27 l. 10 s. of money, with a glebe of 4 acres.
There are 5 heritors in the parish, 3 of whom reside
occasionally, and 2 constantly.  The Earl of Mansfield
is patron.-The school and school-house were built in
1769, and are in tolerable repair.  The schoolmaster's
salary, paid by the heritors, was lately augmented by
them, from 100 to 200 merks.  From his office of ses-
sion-clerk, and as precentor, he may have about 4 l., and
nearly as much from his school-fees making altogether
