	In the above table, those are entered as belonging to the Esta-
blished church, who, whilst members of the same, were sitters at
the time in other places of worship, in consequence of the want of
church accommodation in the Establishment. In the subsequent
tables, all are entered according to the church, chapel, or meet-
ing-house, in which they professed to attend worship in ordinary.
Some, in consequence, are entered as dissenters, who profess to be
members of the Establishment.

	It appears by the foregoing table, that, amongst every 1000
persons professing to attend worship, there are, in the Establish-
ed church, 484 communicants; and among the dissenters, 435
communicants;--that, in the Established church, the proportion
of persons above twenty years of age who are not communicants
is 98 in 1000: and, amongst the dissenters, 134 in 1000;--and
that in the Established church, the proportion of the number of
persons in families, and portions of families, amongst whom there
is not a single communicant, is 55 in 1000; whilst, amongst the
dissenters, the proportion is 157 in 1000.
