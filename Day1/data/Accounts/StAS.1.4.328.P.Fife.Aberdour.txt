south of this ridge, both the soil and the climate are much
more kindly.  The cold winds in Fifeshire blow from the
N. and the E.  The Collello Hills, which form the above
mentioned ridge, afford shelter on the N.; the Gorry Hills,
and a track of high ground, on the E.  These fall gradually
towards the W. running out into different branches, with
little straths between them.  The soil here is generally a
black loam, more or less mixed with sand.  The air is 
dry and healthy.

   Agriculture and Rent.-The north part of the parish is
but poorly cultivated.  Little has been done in the way of
draining or inclosing the fields.  Where farms are small and
leases short, little improvement can be expected upon poor
lands.  The south part is well cultivated, and generally in-

Sterling.  The valued rent is L. 7015, 10 s. Scots.  The
best arable grounds are worth 40 s. the acre.  Some of the
lands about the village have been recently lat at 50 s. and
L. 3, 5 s.  The farmeres are 23 in number.  They sow their 
wheat in the months of August, September and October;
beans and oats in March; barley in the end of April and
beginning of May.  Harvest begins about the end of
August, though it is not general till about the middle of 
September, and the crop is commonly got in by the end of
October.  The north part of the parish is considerably
later.  The old Scots plough continues to be used.  Small's
plough had been lately introduced.  There are about 58
ploughs in the parish; 18 of which are upon the village
acres.  There may be as many carts as ploughs, and per-
haps 160 horses, and about 130 milk-cows.  The rotation
of crops observed by the farmers by is various.  Some sow
