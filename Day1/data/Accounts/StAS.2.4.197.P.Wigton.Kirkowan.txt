	The real rental of the pairish is about L.5000.
        Mansion Houses.-Craighlaw-House, the residence of W. C.
Hamilton, Esq. is the only one worthy of notice in the parish. It
is an old but commodious and comfortable house.
	There is no traditionary or written account of antiquities that
merits attention.

                                IV.-INDUSTRY.
        Agriculture.-
The number of imperial acres in the parish, either cultivated or occasionally
 	in tillage, is                                                     6802 1/2
	(of this number 985 1/2 acres belong to the Marquis of Bute.)
Of acres constantly waste or in pasture,                                  23779
	(of this number, 10287 belong to the Marquis of Bute.)
Of acres that might be cultivated with a profitable application of capital, 628
	under wood, (planted)                                               280
	covered by lochs,                                                   167
	A decided improvement has taken place in agriculture since the
date of last report. The roads are gdnerally in a much better
condition. Arable farms, in respect of subdivision, fencing, rota-
tion of crops, and general management, are in an improved and
improving state. Kirkowan being more a partoral than an arable
district, less attention is consequently paid to tillage, while its in-
land position presents an impediment to those who have a taste
and desire to extend the sphere of cultivation.
        Live-Stock.-The black-faced breed is held in the highest esti-
mation by the holders of this description of stock, being found to
suit the soil and climate better than the more valuable but less
hardy breeds. The number of sheep which constitute the regular
stock may be about 9000. Their merits in respect of wool, &c. are
not inferior to those of other sheep in the adjacent parishes. The
annual clip of wool averages about 1200 stones of 26 lbs. to the
stone, value from 9s. to 17s. per stone.
	The Galloway breed is all but without a rival in this parish.
The land being not rich enough to develope the peculiar excellencies
of this breed, farmers generally dispose of their sale stock when
two years old. These are resold at Dumfries, thence driven
southward, and after a year's feeding on the fertile plains of Eng-
