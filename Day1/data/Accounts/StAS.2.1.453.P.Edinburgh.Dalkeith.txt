   The wide-spreading and magnificent beech trees on the Esks
more particularly, point out this to be their congenial, if not na-
tive region; while the butter-bar, in luxuriance along the sandy
margins, indicate the climate suitable for wheat cultivation: and
perhaps nowhere in Great Britain is agricultural enterprise con-
ducted with more success. Even the Turkey oak (Quercus cerris)
thrives well here; the oak forest of the park, consisting almost
entirely of the common British oak (Quercus Robur) has all the
picturesque effect of gnarled and unwedgeable grandeur; and in
it may be found some "monarch of the wood," which could have
been no sampling when Dr Johnson visited Scotland, and which
even now may bear a comparison with the aged and lordly
forms in some of the parks in England. There are also many
fine specimens of the cedar of Lebanon (Pinus cedrus),+ as well
as of the larch (Pinus larix). Some of the formerare at pre-
sent in fruit, bearing apparently very good cones; and the latter
from the open and exposed situation in which they grow, have
taken the spreading and contorted form of the weathered oak
which has braved many a storm.

<FOOTNOTE>The Tusuilago fragrans, a native of Italy, and here probably the outeast of the
garden, grows luxuriantly, and covers a considerable space in the woods at Eakbank,
    Since writing the above, the Indian cedar (Piltus Deodara), and a few plants of
the Araucaria imbricata, have been planted within the new garden. They are
growing well; and as an indication of climate and season, the Rhododendrou Dauri.
Cum, freely exposed, was in full flower on 9th January 1844.
