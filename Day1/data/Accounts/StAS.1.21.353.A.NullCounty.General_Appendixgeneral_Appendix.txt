     The Statistical Account.

   From these estimates it appears, the cost of the Devon
navigation was the chief article, and very likely struck a fa-
tal blow against the measure.  In attempting any new plan
of improvement, the very cheapest and simplest mode ought
to be first adopted, leaving the more complex and expensive
to experience.  The Devon navigation seems to have been a
favourite object in 1774; and yet the only benefit to be de-
rived is the carriage of coal, and that, too, only with the
contracted view of lowering the price of coal at other places.
There seems no solid reason for incurring so much expence
to obtain an object of such a trifling nature.
   We must keep in view the two grand commodities requi-
red to the countries along the Forth and Teith, viz. coal and
lime: and surely, if these articles can be procured nearer
than Rackmill or Cobble-Crook, or the lime craigs of Lord
Elgin, we should embrace the cheapest.
   We then find that coal can be procured at Bannockburn
and Auchinbowie, and lime at Sauchie and Murrayshall.  A
small canal could be very easily cut from the Forth at Baad,
near Craigforth, to within half a mile of the lime works at
Murrayshall, and two miles of the coal works of Bannock-
burn, to which last works the canal could be extended by
one or two locks.  The greatest stretch of this canal would
not exceed three miles: and it is to be remembered, that the
Forth above the Baad is naturally navigable; and as the works
at Craigforth, mentioned in the estimate of 1774, lie below
the Baad, and would have cost 4033 l. this sum would nearly
complete the proposed canal from Baad to Bannockburn.
From the estimates in 1774, it appears, that no more than
2370 l. would be necessary for making the Forth navigable
from Baad to Gartmore.
   Putting, then, the Devon navigation out of the question;
the present object is, whether it would be cheapest to bring
