the Low Countries, debility and effeminacy would there soon
extinguish their heroic spirit and martial ardour.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The greatest height, which any
individual in the parish has attained, is 6 feet 7 1/2 inches, with-
out shoes and stockings.  The general size of the people is 5 feet
7 1/2 inches; they are tight and well-built.-There are 2 four wheel
chaises, one of them belonging to the vintner at Fort William,
which he lets to travellers:  There are other 3 kinds of ma-
chines of two wheels each; one of these also belongs to the
same vintner.  There may be about two dozen carts.  Sledges
are chiefly used in leading home hay and corn.  Peats, for
the most part, are carried in creels upon horseback.-There
are between 80 and 100 boats in the parish.  Of these, 60
belong to Maryburgh; where there are also 4 sloops, from 20
to 40 tons, and 1 brig of 200 tons.-There are 8 stated ser-
ries; 5 of which are on the salt water.-Bridges and govern-
ment roads are in a good state; but the country roads, which
are carried on at the expence of the counties, have been, and
still are, much neglected.  The statute labour is commuted at
6 d. per day.-In 1782 and 1783, the parish was remarkably
well supplied with provisions.  The Duke of Gordon sent
two cargoes for its relief, one of pease meal, and the other of
potatoes; and the Commissioners of the Annexed Estates sent
two more, one of oats and pease, and the other of potatoes.-
There are no ale-houses in the parish, but many whisky re-
tailers.  Indeed they are so numerous, that they are a nuisance,
and tend, very much, to encourage idleness, and to corrupt
the morals of the people, In Fort-William there are two
inns; and, in almost every other house in Maryburgh, whisky
is sold.-There are 4 students attending universities.-The
