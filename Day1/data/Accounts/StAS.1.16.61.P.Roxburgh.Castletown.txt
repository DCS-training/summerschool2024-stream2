     of Castletown.

   Erection, Form, and Extent.-This parish formerly be-
longed to the Presbytery of Jedburgh; but when the five
churches of Eskdale were erected into the Presbytery of
Langholm, it was added to them in the year 1743.  This
was done on account of its great distance from the former
seat of the presbytery.  Its form approaches nearly to that
of a triangle, whose base runs from east to west, along the
head of Teviotdale, and whose opposite vertex points to
Solway frith.  It contains, according to the map of the
county, about 52,160 acres.  It is the largest parish in the
south of Scotland, being upwards of 18 miles in length, and
14 in breadth.

   General Appearance, Woods,etc.-The general appear-
ance of the upper part of the parish is mountainous; the
lower part is hilly; and all of it, at a distance from the
banks of the rivers, is bleak and wild to a high degree.
But its appearance along the banks of the rivers is altoge-
ther different.  These are generally covered with natural
woods, or young plantations in a very thriving state.  The
barren wilds are entirely hid from the view; the windings
of the river, and the fine holm land on every side, present
the most picturesque scenes, or exhibit rich prospects to the
eye.  These are justly described by our native poet, Dr
Armstrong, in his poem on Health*.  The inhabited part
