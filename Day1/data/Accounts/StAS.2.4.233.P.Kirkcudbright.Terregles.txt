much decayed.
	Upon the farm of Terregles-town, about a mile to thd east
from the church, there was at one time a village of considerable,
extent. Its population is said to have amounted to about 300.
The pavement of the street is still seen, and extends a considerable
length. In the immediate neighbourhood there is a place called the
Gallows-hill, where, according to tradition, criminals were exe-
cuted at an early period.

numents.

maining L.39, 7s. 8d. is obtained from the Exchequer.

dale family, and, subsequently, was exercised by the late Duke of
Queensberry. At present, it is in the possession of the Duke of
Buccleuch.
	Education.--The parochial is the only school in the parish.
A new and cnmmodious school-house has lately been erected.
