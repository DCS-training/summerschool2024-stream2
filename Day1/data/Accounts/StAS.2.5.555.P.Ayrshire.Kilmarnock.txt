It has since been repaired in 1831, at an expense of about
L. 1200. It affords sittings for 1457 persons,-the number of
seats allottdd to the poor being 16. The spire is believed
to have been built in 1410. Being a collegiate church, there are
two manses and. two grebes. The manse attached to the first
charge was built about 1763, and repairs and additions were made
in 1780 and 1802. The glebe extends to 12 acres; and its pre-
sent annual value is about L. 30. Both ministers are entitled to
no more than the minimum stipend of L. 150 the teinds being
exhausted. The manse of the second charge was erected in 1826;
and having been superficially finished, has required to be repeat-
edly and considerably repaired. The glebe consists of 4 1/2 acres,
partly occupied by manse, offices, &c, and yields at present in
grass L. 12 a-year. A new and handsome place of worship, in
the Gothic style with a very elegant front and massive tower, was
lately built in the town subscription, and opened 1836, ca-
pable of containing about 1700 sitters; but as the debt upon it is
considerable, and no separate parish has yet been assigned to it,
the duty, by a temporary arrangements, is done by the two mini-
sters of the collegiate church alternately.
	Since the year 1834, there has been a missionary in the parish,
paid by means of an annual voluntary subscription, and employed
as an additional labourer in the midst of our crowded town popu-
lation; and there has, moreover, been for some time a service in
an old chapdl in the village of Crooked Holm, conducted by a li-
centiate of the church who resides there.
	Within the Laigh parish quoad sacra, there is a large place of
worship belonging to the Relief Synod which is rather remarkable,
from its being ornamented with a tall spire, and haviog a bell for
summoning the meetings of the congregatin. The Cameronians,
the United Secession, and the Independents, have each a meeting-
house; and a small body of Original Seceders assemble for wor-
ship in a hall of the academy.
	The parish quoad sacra contains between 16,000 and 17,000
inhabitants. In February 1836, an ecclesiastical survey was made,
which, although not quite completed, was the means of ascer-
taining the situation of about 15,2000 of the people. The same
questions being asked in every house, 8957 were returned as be-
longing to the Established Church; 6119 as connected with other
denominations of all sorts; and 174 as not known to belong to any
denomination. The Established Church must have suffered most
