near the middle of this century, Criess had continue for 
ages to be the great mart to which the dealers in England
annualy resorted, to purchase, for the English markets, the
droves of black cattle reared in the Highlands of Scotland.
And old people here sometimes speak with deep regret of 
the glorious seene displayed to view, when 30,000 black
