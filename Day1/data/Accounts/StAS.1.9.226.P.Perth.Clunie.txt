lower tire of the Grampian mountains, to S.E. where it
stretches downwards into Strathmore to the neighbourhood
of the Roman encampment at Meiklour.  Its greatest
breadth is about 4 miles from N. E. to S. W.; and it is
intersected towards the S. E. by a small arm of the parish
of Caputh.

   Name and Language.-The English language has made
considerable progress here among the better sort of people,
since the Union of the Scottish and English crowns; but
the vulgar still continue to speak the Scotch, a dialect of
of the Dano-Saxon, which was brought from the other side
of the German Ocean, by the Danish invaders of the ninth
and eleventh centuries.  Some of the people who border on
the Highlands, have a smattering of, and retain a predilec-
tion for the Gaelic or Celtic, which seems to have been the
original language of the whole island.  Of this language
there are many traces here, particularly in the names of
places; which names either mark the local situation, or
refer to some transaction that has taken place there in di-
stant times.  For example, Clunie, which has time imme-
morial been the name of the parish, is the modern ortho-
graphy of the old Celtic word Cluaine, which signifies,
"plain green pasture between woods:" A plain, green
pasture, called the Meadow, lies a little to the north of the
church; on the north side of this plain, there is still natural
wood growing, and on the south side of the plain, we find
vestiges of old trees in a small moss or mire, which makes
a part of the glebe*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Stron, situated at the entrance of the hill of Clunie, signifies the
"nose, promontory, or heel of the hill."  Dullatir, (in Gaelic, Dui-
lea-tire, the "black, bleak half side of the country,") lies in the heath,
on a high, cold, northern exposure, perfectly corresponding to its name.
