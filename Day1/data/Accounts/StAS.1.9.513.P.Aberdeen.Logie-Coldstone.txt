writer of this was settled here in 1779; the number of in-
habitants since that time is considerably decreased.  At
that period, all the farms were occupied by tenants and
subtenants; but at present there are about 20 families quite
extirpated, and their possessions in natural grass.  In 1780,
there were 1300 souls in the parish, at present (1793)
there are 1182.  The annual average of births since 1780
is 23; of marriages, 10.  The people follow, in general,
the occupation of husbandry.  There are 2 smiths, 1 car-
penter, 2 shoemaker, and 4 shopkeepers, who sell small
articles for the good of the country.  The chief manufac-
ture, till about 1789, was that of knitting stockings by the
women, the wool brought by manufacturers from Aber-
deen.  For 3 years past spinning on the two-handed wheel
is much introduced, and found more profitable.  The lint
is given out to spin, just in the same way as the wool, by
manufacturers from Aberdeen, Brechin, and as far south as
Dundee.  The whole inhabitants are members of the E-
stablished Church, and speak all that dialect of English,
common in the north of Scotland.

   Agriculture.-Oats and common bear are the principal
productions of the parish; some pease and rye are also raised;
but the quantity of these kinds of grain is but small, when
compared with oats and bear.  Potatoes are of late culti-
vated by every family, whether of farmers or labourers,
for their own subsistence: a few turnips are sown, some in
drills and some in broadcast; but for want of inclosures, as
winter herding is not introduced, they must be pulled before
they come to much perfection.  The old Scots plough is al-
most universally used.  Some of the most substantial tenants
put 12 oxen in the plough, others 10, others 8, the poorer
fort 2 horse, and 2 cows, some of them 1 horse, 2 cows, and
2 small oxen.  Clover and rye-grass have been cultivated on
