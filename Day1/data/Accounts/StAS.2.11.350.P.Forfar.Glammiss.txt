amount to L.25 per annum. The other teachers depend on the
school fees. One of them is allowed, by the farmers in his district,
a few bolls of meal yearly. The number of their scholars may
amount to 100 or 120.
	There are four Sabb`th schools in the parish, generally well at-
tended. An infant school was opened in the village of Glammiss
at Whitsunday last, and is very flourishing. It is attended by
about 60 scholars, who pay 1d. each per week. The school-
mistress has a salary of L. 25 per, annum, which is paid by a sub-
scription in the parish and neighbourbood. The Trustees of the
late Earl of Strathmore have generously allowed the teacher a house
and garden, with play-ground, and have fitted up the school in the
best manner for the purpose; and they and the other heritors are
now about to erect a new parochial school at Glammiss, the pre-
sent one being found much too small and inconvenient. Mr Ja-
mieson Willis, the minister's assistant, besides his other labours,
has regular classes through the week in different parts of the pa-
rish, for instructing the young people in the knowledge of the great
truths of the Gospel.
