   Church-The Earl of Moray is patron of the parish of
Petty.  The church and manse are near each other, and are
situated on an eminence facing the south east, near the head
of a small by slung out of the Frith.  This situation is
both healthy and agreeable, as it is dry, and commands an
extensive view of the country; but the church is situated ra-
ther inconveniently for the parishioners, as, instead of being
in or near the center, it is placed on a spot almost detached
from the rest of the parish.  The church was built about
three and twenty years ago, has received very little repara-
tion since, and appears to be in a sufficient state.  The
manse was built about forty years ago, and has been repaired
different times.  The stipend is 78 bolls of barley, 2 bolls of
oat-meal, and thirty pounds Sterlng of money, with about
ten acres of glebe land, most of it a poor light soil.  The
present incumbent, Mr William Smith, was admitted in
September 1775, was married in 1779, and has five child-
ren; two of them sons, and three daughters.  His prede-
cessors in office were Mr John Morrison admitted in 1759,
who died in November 1774; Mr Aeneas Shaw admitted in
1742, who was translated to Forres in 1758; Mr Lewis
Chapman admitted in 1738, who died in 1741; Mr John
Duncanson admitted in 1728, who died in 1737; Mr
Daniel M'Kenzie admitted in 1719, who was translated to
Inverness in 1727.  He was preceded by Mr Alexander Du-
noon the last Episcopal minister of this parish, who was
admitted in 1684, and continued till his death in 1718.
All the inhabitants of this parish are of the established
church.
