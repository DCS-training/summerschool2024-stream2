for it.  The leading costs the poor people dear; no less in re-
turn than a day's reaping in harvest, equal to 8 d. for each
cartfull.  Ten of these cartfulls suffice for a labourer's family,
and that quantity may be cast by one man in one day.
Dry broom, furze, and branches of decayed fir-trees, aid the
scanty quantity of peats to many, and wholly supply their
place to some.  A few families use a little coal, which is im-
ported from England, at the price of about 4 1/2 d. per Winches-
ter bushel, or 1 d. per stone avoirdupois.  There is lime-stone
in the parish, though in no great quantity; and, from the
scarcity of fuel, no attempt has been made to burn it.

   Antiquities.-The principal monument of antiquity in the
parish, is a famous Cistertian abbey, founded by Devorgilla,
daughter of Allan, Lord of Galloway, wife to John Baliol,
Lord of Castle-Bernard, and mother of John Baliol, King of
Scotland.  It was first called the Abbey of Sweet-heart, from
the circumstance of her husband's heart being embalmed, and
inclosed in a box of ivory bound with silver, which was built
into the walls of the church: but that name was afterwards
changed into that of Newabbey.  This structure stands in the
middle of a fine level field of about twenty acres, called the
precinct, inclosed by a stone wall 8 or 10 feet high, built of
granite stones of great size, some of them, even near the top
of the wall, seem to be no less than a ton in weight.  The
abbey itself, which was erected towards the end of the twelfth
century, is a beautiful and lofty building, of the light Gothic
stile of architecture; its church is 194 feet long, 102 feet
broad at the cross, and 66 feet at the ends, with a tower up-
wards of 90 feet high.  This place is frequently visited by
strangers; and is particularly described by Grofe and Cardon-
nel, in their late publications on the antiquities of Scot-
land.
