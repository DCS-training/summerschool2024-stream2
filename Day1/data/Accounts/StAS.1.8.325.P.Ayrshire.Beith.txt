     of Beith.

   Dissenters.-There are two dissenting meetings in the town
of Beith:  One of them, which is attended by that class of Sece-
ders, called Antiburghers, commenced above 30 years ago.
The first minister ordained to this charge soon after renounced
his connection with that society, and embraced the communion
of the Established Church.  He published at Edinburgh in
1764, the reasons which induced him to this measure, under
the title of A farewel Address to the Associate Congregation of
Beith, by John Laidly, A. M.  It mutt be mentioned to the
honour of this congregation, that they co-operate, as far as
their weekly collections can allow them, with the Established
Church, in supporting the poor of the parish.  They contri-
bute for this purpose at the rate of about 7 L. annually, which
is distributed jointly with the parish funds formerly mention-
ed;-an example worthy to be imitated; by all dissenters.
The other dissenting meeting is connected with the society,
who are called Relief.  It commenced about 9 years ago.

   Antiquities.-Before the reformation, there were 2 chapels
for public worship in this parish; one where the present
church now stands, (whereof a small fragment of the wall is
still to be seen,) and the other upon the lands of Treehorn,
one end of which remains entire.  This chapel, with two
acres of land adjoining to it, belonged to the monastery of
Kilwinning, as appears from a charter under the great seal,
in the possession of the proprietor, dated in the year 1594*.
   There were formerly several castles, or square towers in
the parish.  All of them have been razed to the foundation
but one, which forms at present a stately ruin.  It was an-
tiently the seat of the Montgomeries of Giffan.
