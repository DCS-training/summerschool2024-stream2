   Fairs.-There are three fairs or trysts held annually in the vil-
lage of Gifford; viz. on the last Tuesday of March, the third Tuesday
of June, and the first Tuesday of October. At these fairs, about
500 cattle, as many horses, and between 3000 and 4000 sheep are
usually offered for sale. Many purchasers come from a considerable
distance; and generally a good deal of business is done. At the
last-mentioned fair, the Agricultural Society of East Lothian meet
at Gifford to award premiums for the best pens of sheep of diffe-
rent kinds. About twenty years ago, leave was obtained to hold a
tryst on the Monday mornings during harvest for hiring shearers.
This has of late been a great nuisance to the parish; as the shearers,
to the number often of 500, flock to Gifford on Sabbath; and not
only wait to be hired, but profane the Lord's day by drunken and
disorderly conduct. A bill, like that of Sir Andrew Agnew, would
be no small blessing.
   Inns,-Alehouses, &c.-Of these there are seven in the parish.
   Fuel.-All our coal is brought from the parishes of Salton and
Pencaitland,-a distance of six miles. The price of a cart-load is
7s.6d., viz. 4s. for 12 cwt. of coal, and 3s.6d. for carriage.
