     General Appendix to [Vol. v.

'conversions in money, or the statute services, (if exacted as
'herein before provided,) shall, in the discretion of the
'trustees, be solely applicable to the several roads men-

'think proper, but only till such time as the toll levied
'thereon shall be sufficient to pay the interest of the money

bitants of the parish of Ochiltree can only conclude that it
has been applied to the reduction of the debts contracted for
making the turnpike roads, and are thence encouraged to
hope that part at least of the statute money will soon be ap-
plied to the repair of parish or cross roads; from the badness
of which, at present conjoined with the exterior position of much of
the turnpike roads, the inhabitants of Ochiltree pa-

intercourse.
   Finally, on this subject, we shall take notice of an objec-
tion, which, from having formerly heard it, we suspect may
be renewed against the above statement, and we do so the
rather, because we believe that the consideration of this ob-
jection may serve to throw light on the whole subject, and it
is the following, viz. that the parishes of Ochiltree and Stair
are but one parish.  In answer, we observe, that said parishes
were disjoined above a century ago, before there was any act
for turnpike roads or statute money in this country; And
