under the command of MacDougall's son, and, both parties en-
gaging, MacDougall's son and some of his adherents were slain,
and the rest pursued till the night and woods did separate them.
There are yet cairns or some heaps of stones remiaining, which were
made in the places where the dead were found, denominated from
the persons killed. Thus the knight got possession. Not long
after this, MacDougall, bearing that the knight had sent a few
men to take tip the rents in the country, sent a party to surprise
them, and cut them off; but they, getting intelligence hereof,
were in readiness to receive them, and repelled them with the loss
of two of MacDougall's men. A third encounter they had, but

year 1637, annexed to be one charge, together with the parish of
Ardchattan or Baillevaodain, on the other side of Loch Etive ; yet
was a part of the diocess of Dunkell, and the Bishop of Dunkell,
titular of the whole tithes, parsonage and vicarage, within the
same, and patron of Killesbuigkerill, it being one of his mensal
kirks; but the knigbts of Calder were always tacksmen of the
tithes, and paid a certain feu-duty to the bishop, besides the mi-
nister's stipend. The knights of Calder have other lands adjoin-
