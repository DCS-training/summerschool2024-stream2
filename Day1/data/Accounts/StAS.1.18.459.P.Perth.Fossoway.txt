the lands of Tulliebole; some of them on the northern, but
the greatest number on the southern branch of Fossaway.
They are partly in larger plantations, partly in smaller
stripes; and where they are sufficiently fenced, are, in
general, in a thriving state.  The trees are of various kinds;
Scotch fir, plane, larch, oak, elm, beech, ash, spruce
fir, and laburnum.  The Scotch fir are in the greatest num-
ber; and the larch grows quickest.  The last will soon add
greatly to the beauty of the country, and afford excellent
shelter.

   Cultivation and Produce of the Parishes.-Some of the origi-
nal inhabitants still retain the old method of ploughing,
using the old Scotch plough, and joining oxen with horses.
Those who are attached to the old modes of farming, are so
far from troubling themselves with improvements, that they
are not fond of changes of any kind.  If a large stone lies in
the field, or, if the furrows are drawn crooked, they are un-
willing to remove the one, or alter the other; observing that
they were so in their fathers days, and that the crops were as
good then as they are now.  The greatest part of the farmers
have happily different views.  The new method of ploughing
with two horses, and Small's plough, is very generally a-
dopted.  In the improvement of their lands, a considerable
number of the farmers spare neither pains nor expence.
They bring ploughmen from every quarter, and have brought
the art of ploughing to a very high degree of perfection.
The number of ploughs cannot be ascertained; because on

the culture in use.  The ploughs in the parish of Fossaway,
according to the statute work, are upwards of 50; those of
the parish of Tulliebole, about 24; more ploughs, however,
are occasionally used.  Besides, several of the proprietors
