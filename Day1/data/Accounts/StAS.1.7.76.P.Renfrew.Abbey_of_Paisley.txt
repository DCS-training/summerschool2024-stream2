which is still but too common.  This has been ascribed to the
water used by the inhabitants in Paisley: It more probably
proceeded from, it certainly was greatly aggravated by, poor
living, and by the damp shops which were necessary for the
linen manufacture; for, since silk-weaving became the gene-
ral employment, and increase of trade has introduced better
living, this disorder is less-frequent.  From the same causes
probably it is that swelled and sore legs, once extremely com-
mon here, are now but rarely met with.  Dysentery raged
with great violence in 1765; since that time it has been
scarcely complained of.  Nervous fevers at times appear, but
they are neither very general nor uncommonly fatal.  It is to
be apprehended, that the confinement and sedentary posture
of the weaver, and the laborious life of the bleacher, are
frequent causes of consumptive complaints.  Intermittents,
which, from the damp air, and adjoining moss, might be ex-
pected to be common, are not so much as known.

   Water.-The water in Paisley and the suburbs is but in-
different; and there is scarce any thing more wanted for the
convenience and comfort of the inhabitants than a plentiful
supply of good spring water.  But now, that every spring and
rill is occupied and become valuable property, this is scarcely
to be hoped for.

   Rivers.-Besides the Black Cart, which, rising in Castle
Semple Loch, partly bounds the parish on the north, and
the river Levern, which marks it on the south-east, the
parish is watered by the river White Cart.  It rises in the
high grounds about Kilbride, and, entering this parish from
the east, flows in a pretty direct westerly course towards the
town.  After forming a beautiful fall at Seedhill-mill, it
turns northerly, and, about a mile below the town, enters
