the various accidents to which they are liable.  The princi-
pal methods of improvement which have been adopted of
late years are, stocking lightly; taking low farms for winter,
or reserving winter grass in the lowest parts of the same
farm; selecting the best rams, which they often bring from
distant places where they can find them, of better size and
shape, and equally hardy; selling off the weak ewes in the
latter end of the season, and the small lambs either at that
time or about Lammas.  Where the farm is large, dividing
the sheep into different flocks, which are kept separate all
the year round, and changing the rams from one flock to an-
other; sending the rams to richer pasture in the winter and
spring; smearing much lighter than was formerly the prac-
tice.  It is never found advantageous to give up smearing al-
together, though it has often been tried.  The sheep always
became worse, and the wool less in quantity, and inferior in
quality, unless the season was remarkably mild.
   The farmers here have certainly given less attention to the
improvement of wool than it merits.  The only sheep used is
the common black and grey faced, and no fair trials have
been made, whether any other species with finer wool would
thrive with them, though they are invariably of opinion that
they would not.  Hence the wool is in general coarse.  It

lity till the wedder is 6 years old.  They are usually sold at
three.  A wedder of this age weighs 10 or 11 lib. averdu-
pois per leg, has 6 or 7 lib. ditto of fat, and sells at 11 s.
