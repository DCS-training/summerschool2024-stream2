        Hydrography.--The parish is watered by no stream of note,
except on the eastern boundary, for some miles by the Garnock;
and on the south-east, for a short space, by the mingled waves of
the Gardock and Irvine, before they fall into the sea. The wind-
ings of the Garnock, from Kilwinning to its junction with the
Irvine, bear some resemblance to the celebrated windings of the
Forth at Stirling. The banks of the rivulet, which flows through
Stevenston, are of considerable bauty at Grange, and as far up
as the Glen, where there is a picturesque little cascade. It is at
present sub judice, whether Ashgrove Loch be in whole, or only in
part, within this parish. It covers thirty or forty acres.
