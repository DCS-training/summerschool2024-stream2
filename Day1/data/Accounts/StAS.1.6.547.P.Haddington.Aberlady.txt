     of Aberlady.

   Soil and Surface.-Within this border, for a considerable way,
the soil is, for the most part light, with a mixture of loam;
but the middle part of the parish, almost from the E. to the
w. extremity of it is generally poor, flat, sandy, and partly
liable to be flooded during heavy rains.  From this flat, the
ground rises gradually toward the S. being part of that fertile
bank of land which extends from Fawsyde to Whitekirk.
The landed property of this parish, exclusive of a small part of
Redhouse, is divided into four baronics, Aberlady, Gosford,
Balncrieff, Lussness.

   Population.-The whole of that landed property, exclusive
of some enclosures about the houses of Balncrieff and Gos-
ford, and a few acres belonging to feuars in Aberlady, is pos-
sessed by eight farmers.  The farms are large, which is un-
friendly to population.  The village of Gosford is entirely de-
stroyed, and that Balncrieff falling into decay.  The return to
Dr. Webster in 1755, however, was only 739 souls.  By an
accurate enquiry very lately made, from house to house, the
number of souls was found to be precisely 800, of which
number 386 were in the village of Aberlady.  At an average
of births and marriages for the last 25 years, there have been
exactly 4 births to each marriage.

   Parochial Funds.-There are no charity funds or mortified
money in the parish, except 1600 merks by Sir Peter Wedder-
burn of Gosford; the yearly interest of which is ordered to be
paid to backgone tenants, and others on these lands.  The
poor, who are not very numerous, are supported by the week-
ly collections at the church doors, aided occasionally by a vo-
luntary parochial assessment, of which the tenants pay one
half.  These assessments have been so moderate, that for 21
