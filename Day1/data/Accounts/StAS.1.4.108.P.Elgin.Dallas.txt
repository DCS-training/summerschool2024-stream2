   Miscellaneous Observations.-The air is sharp and dry.
The inhabitants are generally healthy.  The small-pox is
become less fatal by means of inoculation.
   There are some chalybeate springs, but seldom resorted

is likewise a freestone quarry of excellent quality.

niche on the outside of the wall, stands a stone weather-
