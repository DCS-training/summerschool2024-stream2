ground be but a little higher than the level of the sea; after
which there is a gradual ascent, with a few variations, to the
upper part of the parish.  As the parish lies very flat, there
are few springs of soft water; and, in dry summers, many
have considerable difficulty, and must go to a great distance to
procure water for themselves and their cattle.  There are a few
streams of soft water in the parish, arising from mosses; but
they contain very little water in summer.  The moss consi-
derable of these streams, or burns, divides the parish of Cri-
mond from Loanmay, and falls into the Loch of Strathbeg;
but its whole course, with all its turnings, will not exceed 4
miles.  Yet, though there is rather a scarcity of soft water,
there are many mineral springs; most of them are supposed
to be much impregnated with iron.  None of them, however,
have been much used for any medicinal purpose.

   Heritors and Rent.-The parish is divided among 4 heri-
tors: Mr. Irvine of Drum, proprietor of the lands of Crimond
and Millhill; Mr. Harvey of Broadland, proprietor of the lands
of Rattray and Broadland; Mr. Duff of Feteresso, proprie-
tor of Logie; and Mr. Annand of Haddo, proprietor of Had-
do; besides 2, who possess only a few acres each.  Of these,
Mr. Harvey of Broadland generally resides.  The valued rent
of the parish is 2172 L. 13 s. 4 d. Scotch; the real rent is above
13 col. Sterling.  The value of the land here has risen very
considerably during the lair 50 or 60 years.

   Manufactures and Commerce.-From the scarcity of water in
the parish, there can be no manufactures established here.  The
women, however, are employed partly in spinning flax, for
the manufacturers of Aberdeen and Peterhead; partly in
spinning tow, which is manufactured into a coarse kind of
narrow cloth, called barn, which labouring people use for
