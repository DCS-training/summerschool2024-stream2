   Woods, Rent, etc.-On several estates in the parish, as well
as on the property of the burgh, are thriving plantations of fir
from 20 to 30 years old, and it is generally supposed that an
acre of thriving fir trees 30 years old, would bring its proprie-
tor at least, 20 s. for every year of its growth, after paying all
expences.  This is certainly turning waste lands (and such in
general are the lands on which fir thrive best here) to very
good account; besides that by the annual shedding of the leaves
the soil is enriched, and rendered sitter for the purposes of a-

rent is probably about as much sterling*.
   There are 3 large farms which bring about L. 200 of rent

L. 40 to L. 100 and the rest are small possessions occupied in

try part of the parish, as well as in the town, form the most
considerable body of labourers.  A weaver in the country, in
general, has as much land as will maintain a cow or two, and
sometimes a horse, throughout the year; and on most estates
in the parish, are little villages peopled chiefly by tenants
of this description, who join their horses together to form a
