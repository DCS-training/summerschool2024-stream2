     Statistical Account

the north-west are seen a number of gentlemen's seats, and
plantations around them, the whole range of Ochil-hills, the
celebrated Grampian mountains, Campsie hills, and the
towering top of Benlomond.  This prospect, which includes
also a view of the towns on the opposite coast, must charm
the spectator of taste, and afford high entertainment to all
who take pleasure in contemplating the sublime and variegated
works of nature and art.  From the high grounds in a clear
day, the eye may take a pleasing range over part of II coun-
ties, in cultivation equal, if not superior, to any in Scotland.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-When the navigation by the
canal between Forth and Clyde was first projected, it was

this town and its harbour, the east termination should have
been here, and not at Grange-burn.  It would serve no good
purpose at present, to point out the causes which combined
to place the termination otherwise.  Suffice it to say, the public
would, in all probability, have been much better accommo-
dated, and Bo-ness would have increased ten fold.  To prevent
this town from suffering the disadvantages apprehended from
the termination of the canal at Grange-burn, a subscription
was opened in the year 1782, on an estimate for a canal of
communication from the harbour of Borrowstownness to
Grangemouth, supposed to cost about L. 12,000, and sub-
scriptions for L. 10,000 were procured.  The canal was cut
from Avon-water eastward, within a mile of the town, and
an aqueduct bridge of stone built for crossing the Avon.
The expence, however, of this work, and that of procuring
two Acts of Parliament, together with salaries and heavy
incidental charges, had, in 1789, exhausted half the subscrip-
tion.  Doubts were then entertained, whether the navigation
could be properly executed for the estimates as the works
