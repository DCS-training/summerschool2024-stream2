   Fisheries.-The fisheries are at a low ebb, the oyster fish-
ery being much degenerated from what it was about 59 
years ago, when eleven large boats belonging to Cramond
were constantly occupied during the season in dragging
oysters, the greatest part of which was sold to Dutch vessels at
an average of 4 s. the herring barrel.  The scalps were then
so productive, that it was usual for a boat with five hands to
make 30 s. a day; but they are now so much destroyed, pro-
bably with over fishing, as to employ at present no more
than 4 or 5 boats, and these only occasionally.  The scalps
about Inch Mickery, belonging to Lady Greenwich, are let
at a rent of L. 24 per annum, to the Newhaven fishers.
The Amon formerly abounded with a variety of fish such as
trouts, grilfes*, some salmon, and great plenty of smelts,
but owing to liming the adjacent grounds, and watering flax
in the river, it was for some years almost totally deserted by
these different kinds of fish, which are still extremely scarce.
Whales have sometimes been stranded on the lands here, parti-
cularly in 1690, when no less a number than 25, though of the
very smallest fort, were left by the tide on the shore south
of Cramond Island; and in 1769, two of the spermaceti
kind, each 54 feet long, were cast ashore not far from the
village of Cramond.

   Minerals.-Free-stone abounds in several places, as also
whin-stone, moor-stone, and granite.  Iron-stone is found
along the shore at Caroline Park; and there is a great ap-
pearance of coal on the sea side in the eastern part of Roys-
toun, and the adjacent lands of Wardie, where large seams
