	Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church, though now 290 years
old, is in very good repair. In 1834 it received an addition to the
accomodation of 120 sittings, by the erection of a gallery, and was
at the same time new-seated. A division of the area also took
place last year, under direction of the Sheriff, when it was appor-
tioned among the landward heritors according to their valued rent.
The communion table affords 44 sittings, which are free. In a
certain sense, indeed, all the seats are free, none of them being let
for money, though in a few instances some small services, such as
shearing in harvest, &c. may be rendered by the occupants to the
proprietors. The church is conveniently situate, as there are not
more than four or five families who are above three miles from it.
Divine service is well attended. The average number of commu-
nicants is 400.
	The manse, which was built in 1805, and received ap addition
in 1827, is a very good house. The glebe contains 10 acres, which
may be worth L. 30. The stipend is 17 chalders, half oatmeal
and half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The
average amount of stipend for the last three years is L. 239, 7s. 4 6/12d.
	A congregation of Burghers was formed in this parish in 1760,
and still exists. Their chapel contains 450 sittings, 360 of which
are let. They give their minister L. 130 per annum. There is
also a Relief congregation, which was formed in 1780. Their cha-
pel contains 700 sittings, 320 of which are let. They pay their
minister L. 110 per annum. The members of these congrega-
tions are collected from fifteen different parishes. Of the 404 fa-
milies which this parish contained in 1831, 118 belonged to the
Relief congregation, 48 to the Burghers, and 236 to the Church.
Of the two remaining families one was Roman Catholic and the
other Cameronian.
	Religious Societies.--A Bible Society was formed here in 1810,
since which time it has paid away L. 950. It used to be auxi-
liary to the British and Foreign Bible Society, but withdrew from
that body five years ago, and is now auxiliary to the Edinburgh
Bible Society. It consists indiscriminately of Churchmen and
Dissenters; but there is also a Bible and Missionary Society, con-
sisting exclusively of Dissenters.
	Education.--There is only one parochial school, which is very
ably conducted by Mr John Gray. The branches taught are,
English, writing, arithmetic, geography, Latin, Greek, French, and
mathematics. The average number of children attending the school
is 170. The number at present is 180, of whom 12 are learning La-
