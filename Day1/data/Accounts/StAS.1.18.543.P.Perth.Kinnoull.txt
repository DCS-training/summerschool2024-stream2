of potatoes are planted by some farmers, which are sold,
when growings in small lots, to tradesmen and labourers, in
Perth and Bridge-end, and usually bring from L. 8, to L. 12
per acre.  Few or no sheep have been kept in the parish, since
the hills were planted, and the practice commenced of laying
down so much ground with clover, and other green crops.
The English plough is generally used. it is drawn by a pair
of horses, and managed by one man without a driver.  All
other implements of husbandry have of late been greatly im-
proved.  The valued rent of the parish, is L. 4775:18:6
Scots.  The real rent may be at present about L. 3017:13:6,
including L. 520 for salmon fishings.
   A considerable part of the parish is inclosed with hedges
of hawthorn, or beech, which makes a fine warm fences as
it does not shed its leaves in the winter; some part with stone
fences.

   Air, Climate, and Diseases.-The air is generally pure and
salubrious; although in winter, the hoar frosts are sometimes
very severe near to the river.  The inhabitants are afflicted
with no peculiar diseases; nor are epidemical infections
either common or remarkably fatal.  Fevers are rare, and are
commonly of the slow and nervous kind, and chiefly among
the lower class.  Rheumatic and asthmatic complaints are
the most prevalent, and especially among the aged of the
poorer fort, which is probably owing in a great measure to
scarcity of fuel, and to cold lodging.  The small-pox is the most
fatal disease among children, as the practice of inoculation has
not even yet become general; at times too, the measles and
hooping cough carry off many infants, when those diseases
prevail in the neighbourhood.  But the people in general,
enjoy good health, and many of them live to old age, though
there are few instances among them of remarkable longevity.
