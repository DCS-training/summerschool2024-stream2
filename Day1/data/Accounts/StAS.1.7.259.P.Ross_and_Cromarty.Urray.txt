people convene and get drunk.  These tipling huts are kept
by such only as are not able to pay a fine, or procure a li-
cence.  They are the greatest nuisance in the parish.  It is a
pity that no effectual mode has as yet been projected for sup-
pressing them.

   Language.-Gaelic is the vernacular language of the whole
parish, except in gentlemen's families.  Several of the inha-
bitants read the English Bible, and can transact business in
that language; but they, as well as the bulk of the people,
prefer religious instruction in Gaelic; and therefore are at
pains to read the Gaelic New Testament, and Psalm Book,
etc.  The names of the places are uniformly Gaelic, expres-
sive of their situation, or of some circumstance which struck
the fancy of the original inhabitants.  Some names of places
recall to view the family economy of the great Barons,
while the feudal government subsisted in its full vigour.  The
wages of their menial servants and tradesmen seem to have
been paid in land.  Hence we find the Smith's Croft, the
Arrow-maker's, the Bow-maker's the Waulker's, the Cook's,
the Baker's, the Piper's, the Fiddler's Croft, etc.  Of there there
are, in this parish, Belnagown, the town of the smiths;
Teanasile, the residence of the siddle; and Cruitach, the field
of the harp, or harper's field.  All the above names, and
more from the same origin, are to be found near ancient seats.
