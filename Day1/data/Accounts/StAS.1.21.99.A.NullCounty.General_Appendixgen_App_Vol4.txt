to the lead-brash.  A cat, when seized with that distemper,
springs like lightning through every corner of the house, falls
into convulsions, and dies.  A dog falls into strong convul-
sions also, but sometimes recovers.  A cow grows perfectly
mad in an instant, and must be immediately killed.  Fortu-
nately this distemper does not affect the human species.
   About 30 years ago, most of the smelters died either mad-
men or idiots.  Now they retain their senses as well as other
people.  The reason given is: formerly spirits were cheap,
and the smelters partook liberally of them at their work.
For many years past they drink nothing at their work, but
pure spring water; they now live as long and as rationally
as others.
   The Leadhills library contains some trash, but as many va-
luable books as might be expected to be chosen by promiscu-
ous readers.  They are the best informed, and therefore the
most reasonable common people that I know.
