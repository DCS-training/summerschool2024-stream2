ly; was a substantial building, all of ashlar Kingoody stone;
and from a very handsome cross on the east gavel, and seve-
ral recesses of hewn stone within, probably for altars, or
shrines of some favourite faints, it had every appearance of
having been the original church when the Roman Catholic
religion prevailed; and from uniformity of building with
the church of Fowlis Easter, it is probable that both were
built sometime in the twelfth century, by the fame Lady
Gray, to whom both estates then belonged.  The west end
of the church, although apparently older, must have been
of a much later date.  It was a very insufficient building,
of bad materials, and had every appearance of that ill-
judged parsimonious simplicity, so much affected by the en-
thusiastic first reformers.  This, therefore, would appear to
have been added to it at the Reformation.

   Steeple.-Upon the west end of the church is the steeple,
which was built by Earl Patrick of Strathmore about 130
years ago.  It has three bells and a clock, which last is the
property of the inhabitants of the village; but it is not well
kept.  On the east end is a square building, also built by
his Lordship.  It stands diagonally, and was formerly joined
to the church, but they are now distinct buildings.  The
lower part is the Castle-Huntly burying-place, and over it
is a room, to which the family used to retire during the in-
terval of divine service.  This room the proprietor has gi-
ven leave to the kirk-session to use for a session-house during
his pleasure.

   New Church.-In room of the old church, a handsome
new one was finished in 1795, with large Gothic windows
in front, towards the south, extremely well finished, and
well seated, with an elegant circular gallery.  The whole
church is capable of containing 1000 hearers and upwards.
