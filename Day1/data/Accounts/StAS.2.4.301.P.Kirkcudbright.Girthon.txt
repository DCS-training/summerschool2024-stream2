			GIRTHON.                          301

which the quantity cultivated may be about 4000 ; leaving the
remainder, or 9480 acres, either as waste or in permanent sheep
pasture. There neither is, nor ever has been, any land in the pa-
rish in a state of individed common. The total rental of Girthon
putting a reasonable value on the house and garden of Cally,
may be estimated, at L.5000, making an average of about,6s. 6d.
per imperial acre. The total old valuation of the parish in the
cess book is L.3281,3s. 6d. Scots, or L.273, 8s. 7 1/2d. Sterling
The average rate of grazing is, for a cow, L.3; for a ewe or full-
grown sheep, 3s.
	The following table must be regarded as only an approximation
to the truth, as the amounts are necessarily variable, to a greater
or less extent, almost every year.

	The duration of leases extends to nineteen, years; and the old
tenants on Mr Murray's estates generally, are seldom removed,
the progenitors of several of the existing farmers having held lands
on the estate for successive generations. The farm-buildings and
inclosures in the parish are generally in a respectable and efficient
state; and the most liberal encouragement is afforded by the
proprietor to his tenants.
	Fisheries.--The Fleet produces salmon and grilse; but the
fishery is seldom let; and, when let, only for a nominal sum.
