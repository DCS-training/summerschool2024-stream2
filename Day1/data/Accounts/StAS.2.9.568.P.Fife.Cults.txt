The real rental of the parish (including feu-duties, and the rent
of lime-quarries) may be stated at L.3000 Sterling.
   Mausion Houses.-Crawfurd Castle and Priory is the only mo-
dern mansion which merits particular notice under this head.
It is a magnificent castellated building in the Gothic style of
architecture. It was erected in 1812-13, by the late proprietor,
Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd. The old seat of the Earls of
Crawfurd and Lindsay was Struthers House, now in ruins, in the
adjacent parish of Ceres. The old mansion house of Bunzeon, on
the estate of that name, was formerly the seat of the Bruces of
Bunzeon. Since the junction of this property with the Crawfurd
estate, it has been converted into a farm-house. Bruce of Bunzeon
represented the burgh of Cupar in the Scottish Parliament of
1703, before the Union.
   Monuments.-There are no ancient monuments of any note in
the church-yard of Cults. On the Walton hill, there is the mau-
soleum of the Crawford family, a handsome Grecian building,
erected by the father of the late Earl. And Sir David Wilkie has
adorned the interior of the church with a noble piece of sculpture
to the memory of his parents. It is executed by Chantrey in the
best style of that distinguished sculptor. The medallion liknesses
which it presents of Mr and Mrs Wilkie, from portraits by Sir
David, are considered very striking.
