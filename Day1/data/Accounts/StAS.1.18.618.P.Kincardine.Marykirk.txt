man died here aged 103 years.  An instance of the mildness
of the climate is apparent from the little quantity of snow
that commonly falls here, and from its short continuance on
the ground.  In 1782, while the Grampian hills were deeply
covered with snow, for the space of 8 or 10 days, the people
in this neighbourhood were busily employed in cutting down,
and gathering their corns; and it is to be observed, that it
was in a great measure owing to this very circumstance,
that many poor individuals were kept alive.  Add to this,
that the bounty of government, and the great care taken by
the heritors, to keep a good part of their grain for the con-

the most necessitous of the inhabitants needed, put this pa-

most of the neighbouring parishes.

   In 1774, Mr Garden stated, probably with less accuracy,
the number of souls to be 1030; since that time, it is evident,
they have been increasing considerably, by the list that is
hereto subjoined.  The increase can easily be accounted for,
by, asserting, that there were not so many families in Luther-
moor then, as there are at present.  At that time, there were
only a few houses in it, belonging to a small number of
feuars; but now it is presumed, there are more families
scattered over it, than there are families in the village of
Mary-kirk.  It was then only a moor, all covered over with
heath; but now, most part of it, is either corn ground, or
planted with trees: and although the soil is cold, spungy,
and wet, yet by trenching, draining, inclosing, and planting
