			UNITED PARISH OF

		    LIBBERTON AND QUOTHQUAN.

        PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

              THE REV. ALEXANDER CRAIK, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Extent.--THE, parish of Quothquan was annexed to that of
Libberton in the year 1669. The united parish extends from north
to south about seven miles, and from east to west about four and
a-half miles. It contains nearly 14 square miles, or 8703 impe-
rial acres.
	Topographical Appearances.--Along the whole course of the
Clyde in this parish, there is a great extent of low level land, con-
sisting of a strong clay soil, a considerable portion of which is covered
with water as often as the Clyde overflows its banks, which gene-
rally happens ten or twelve times in the year; and the soil being
enriched by these inundations, produces luxuriant crops, without
any other manure. Where these holm lands are embanked, (which
is done when it can be effected without great expense,) the crops
are protected against the inroads of the river; but in this, as in other
cases, manure is required to renew the soil.
	The banks of the Clyde rise gently, but in some places rather
suddenly, to the height of 50 or 60 feet above the stream, and ex-
tend to the distance of half a mile or more beyond it. The land
on the banks of the Clyde is generally early and fertile, and its
average rent L. 2, 10s. per acre. As the land recedes from the
Clyde, it becomes more elevated, later, and less productive; and
though there are some early and fertile spots near the Medwim, the
banks of that river are for the most part poor and moorish.
	Meteorology.--On this head, it may be only remarked, that a
greater quantity of rain falls here than on the east coast.
	The climate is neither so warm nor so dry as to render the cul-
ture of wheat an object; but other kinds of grain succeed very well
