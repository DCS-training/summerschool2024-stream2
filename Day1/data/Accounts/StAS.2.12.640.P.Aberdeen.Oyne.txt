      The population by the census in 1821 was     .      676

              Shewing in the last 28 years an increase of 268
                      In 1841,           .          .     796

   The cause of the temporary decrease was the letting of the
lands in larger farms, and discouraging the croft system, in the
end of the last century: but those farms having been again redu-
ced and subdivided, and numerous crofts set apart for labourers
and tradesmen, the population has increased, and is increasing.
There are no villages in the parish, nor any hamlet containing
more than twelve dwelling-houses.
