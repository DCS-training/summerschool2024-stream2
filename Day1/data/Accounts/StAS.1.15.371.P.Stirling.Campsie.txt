rather disposed to give their children a good education; at the
time this account was wrote, there were thirteen Latin scho-
lars at the two parish schools; the other children are certain
of being taught to read English, write and cast accompts;
the common style of education is carried on in the follow-
ing manner:  They learn the sounds of the letters, and the u-
nion of syllables, in the small spelling book; then they receive
the large spelling book; then they get the New Testament,
and the Bible, in which they commonly read some time; and
then the Collection: they get a question in the common cate-
chism to repeat every morning: there is a public repetition
on Saturday, with a psalm on Monday.  There being seve-
ral public works in the parish, the night-school is considera-
ble, being wholly made up of grown persons, who attend for
the purposes of writing and arithmetic, etc.  The wages are
fixed for the parish schools by the heritors and session, at 1 s.
6 d. per quarter for children, half-a-crown for writing and a-
rithmetic, and 3 s. for Latin per quarter, besides what they
voluntarily give as a new-year's-gift.  It is evident that the
encouragement is too low; perhaps it would be the interest
of Government that they should have some little addition of
salary given to them; let the wages remain as low as pos-
sible, to induce the people to send their children to school;
from this circumstance of the want of encouragement, and
likewise from being in the neighbourhood of an University,
from whence students come to be our schoolmasters, who
have farther prospects, there have been no less than thirteen
school-masters in the parish school, since the year 1759.
Upon the whole, I would style the common education of
Scotland, partly religious, and partly philosophical; It would
not be our interest to see it violently broken in upon; it is
this mode of education which gives the Scotch nation such an
attachment to speculation in religion; it is only following
out what they have been taught in the early period of their
