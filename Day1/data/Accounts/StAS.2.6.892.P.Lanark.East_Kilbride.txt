This cairn was peculiar, from having in the bottom a circle of
large flags set on edge, not perpendicularly but sloping a little
outward.  They were of a hard gritty schistus, found plentifully
in the neighbourhood.  It is to be regretted that Mr Ure's advice
has been neglected, that what still existed of this circle should be
allowed to remain as an example ofthe peculiarity, which is very rare.
   Mansion-Houses, &c.-There is no mansion-house in the parish
which is entirely modern, except that of Mr Kippen at Lawmuir.
The greater part of Crossbasket House is modern.  Calderwood
House is now receiving an extensive and most beautiful addition.
Torrance House has been added to at different times.  The old-
est part is about 500 years old.  It may here be noticed, that the
property of Mains now belongs to the Torrance family, and that
a stone having the arms of Scotland cut upon it, which was for-
merly placed over a beautifully arched gate at the chief entry to
Mains Castle, by the drawbridge, was, about 100 years ago,
transferred by Colonel Stuart to the front of Torrance House,
above the entrance.  Limekilns House has also been gradually
brought to its present state by successive additions.  The House
of Kirktoun Holm, belonging to Sir Alexander Montgomerie
Cunningham, was a very elegant modern structure in the time of
Mr Ure; but it is not occupied as a family residence at the pre-
sent day.  Cleughern Lodge, belonging to Lady Montgomerie,
is a pleasant and convenient residence for shooting quarters.
The new manse, with its offices, is a very elegant modern building,
as well as a most comfortable habitation, which does great credit
at once to the taste and consideration of the heritors.  It stands
very conspicuously at the south-east end of the village, close to
the Strathavon road.

                         III.-POPULATION.
