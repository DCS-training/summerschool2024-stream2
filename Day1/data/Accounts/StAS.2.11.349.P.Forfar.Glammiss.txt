with  L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The glebe and
garden contain nearly 7 acres Scots. The last augmentation was
settled in 1824. The teinds are not exhausted. The present in-
cumbent was ordained in 1780.
        Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of p`upers who re-
ceive regular parochial aid is 25, exclusive of occasional paupers.
One old woman, who is bed-ridden, costs the kirk-session 5s. per
week. Another,who is deranged, is boarded at the rate of L. 12
per annum. Some receive from 2s. 6d. to 10s. monthly; and
others from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. weekly, according to circumstances.
The amount paid out by the kirk-session in 1834, was L. 136,
5s. 6 1/2d. The poor's funds of the parish being exhausted, the
heritors, wishing as long as possible to avoid a general assessment,
have agreed to advance what is necessary for the support of the
indigent. The church collections and the money received for mar-
riage proclamations, the use of the mortcloth and hearse in 1834,
amounted to L. 77, 19s. 5 1/2d.
        Friendly Societies.-There are two friendly societies in the pa-
rish, namely those of the Masons and the Gardeners. Some years
ago they erected a handsome building in the village, where they
hold their meetings. It consists of two large halls, and some smaller
apartments. There are about 200 members in each society. Each
member of the Masons' Society pays 1s., and of the Gardeners
Is. 6d. per quarter. When any of the members are in distress and
unable to work, they have a weekly allowance for their support. The
widows of masons are allowed L. 1, 10s. yearly and their children

tnder seven years of age are allowed 10s. each per annum. Their
orphans have 10s. yearly till they are ten years old. The widows
of gardeners are allowed L. 1 per annum, and their children under
ten years of age are allowed 1Os. each yearly. The stock of the
Mason Lodge amounts to L. 350; and that of the Gardeners to
about L. 300
        Library.-In-1828, a subscription library was formed in the vil-
lage of Glammiss, and now contains from 600 to 700 volumes,
managed by a commitee of the members. The annual subscrip-
tion is 4s.; entry-money, 5s. Various donations of books have
been given by individuals in the neighbourhood.
        Education.-Besides the parochial school, there are three pri-
vate unendowed schools in the parish. The salary of the paro-
chial schoolmaster is the maximum, with a good house and garden.
The average number of his scholars is about 70. His fees may
