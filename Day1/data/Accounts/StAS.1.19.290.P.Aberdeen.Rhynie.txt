     Statistical Account

   Boundaries.-The parish of Rhynie is bounded by the
parishes of Cairnie, Cabrach, Auchindore, and Gartly.

   Extent and Contents, etc.-The figure of the parish is
nearly square, it being 5 English miles long, and nearly as
broad.  It contains 8 of the 48 davachs or davachs of the
lordship of Strathbogie.  A davach contains 32 oxen-
gates* of 13 acres each, or 416 acres of arable land.  At
this rate, the whole lordship of Strathbogie anciently was
estimated at 19,968 acres, or, in round numbers, 20,000
acres of arable land.  About one-third of this is infield or
croft-land, and two-thirds outfield.

   Lordship of Stratbogie.-As this lordship was one of
the five divisions of the county of Aberdeen, anciently
called Lordships or Thanages, as it included the whole ori-
ginal estate which King Robert Bruce gave to the noble
family of Gordon, and as it has been overlooked by Dr
Anderson in his Survey of the County of Aberdeen, the
writer of this account thinks himself bound to take notice
of it.  The whole lordship of Strathbogie comprehends
120 square miles, including both the arable and unculti-
vated lands.  It lies on both sides of the river Bogie
which empties itself into the Deveron, near Huntly.  In
1424, when the proprietor of it was one of the hostages for
the ransom of Ring James I. his rental was stated to be
L. 400 Scotch money of that age, while the estates of the

*By act of  , March 11. 1585, an oxengate, or oxgate, contains
 , 4 oxengate a twenty-shilling land, 8-oxengate a forty-shilling
land.  Some of the oxengates in the lordship of Strathbogie are not
6 acres; others above 19 acres-The hills are less cultivated, and the low
grounds, formerly in wood, are now more in culture.  That has probably
occasioned the inequality.  Therefore, in the above account, the legal mea-
sures of a davoch and oxgate are preferred to indefinite measures.
