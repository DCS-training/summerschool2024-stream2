   No man who can work is at any loss to provide comfort-
ably for himself and family, because the price of labour is
now a great deal more than it was some years ago, is in-
creased since last year, and increasing still, while that of
meal, the chief article of living, is nearly, at an average,
the same it was 20 or 30 years ago*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The encouragement given to men, women, and children, by manu-
facturers, hath drawn so many people from the country to them, that the
few remaining avail themselves of the scarcity of hands, for obtaining an
augmentation of wages.  A labourer, in summer, earns a-day, accord-
ing to his ability for work, his known diligence and dispatch in working,
from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 4 d. and 1 s. 6 d.; from the 12th of November to the
12th of February, 1 s. or 1 s. 2 d.; in autumn, those who are engaged
for the whole harvest, whether men or women, receive from L. 1, 5 s. to
L. 1, 10 s. with their victuals; those hired by the day, during that sea-
son, 1 s. 6 d.; of late more has been given, and their diet also furnished.
Hay-cutters, if paid by the day, receive from 1 s 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d; if by
the acre, from 1 s 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d. sometimes 2 s. 6 d. according to the
 se or difficulty which evidently attends the work to be performed.  The
wages of a carpenter, the day, are 1 s. 6 d.; of a mason, 1 s. 8 d.; both of
late 2 s. Of a tailor, 1 s.; but a deduction of 4 d. is always made from
the above, when the employer furnishes provisions.  Many kinds of work
are contracted for by the piece, and cars is taken by the worker, that no
engagement of this sort small afford less to him, upon the whole, than
some, if not the highest, of the above mentioned wages, the day.  Every
tradesman estimates his work, one day with another, at 1 s. 6 d. and 2 s.
