     LING.-PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD).

     By the Rev. Mr COLIN MACVEAN, Minister.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE name is evidently derived from the Gaelic Cean
mor, (pronounced Kenmore) in that language signify-
ing great head; and is probably so called from a beautiful
head-land projecting into the east end of Loch Tay, and on
which the village and church of Kenmore are built.  This
parish is situated in that division of Perthshire called Bread-
albane, in the presbytery of Dunkeld, and synod of Perth
and Stirling.  On the east it is bounded, about two miles
below the village of Kenmore, with the parishes of Dull and
Weem; on the west, by a part of the parishes of Killin and
Weem; on the south and north, by those hills which rise
to a considerable height from the sides of the loch, and bor-
dering on the south with the parishes of Comrie and Mo-
nivaird, etc. and on the north with the parishes of Fortin-
gale and Weem.  This parish is about 7 miles in breadth,
and extends to the west, from the village of Kenmore, on
both sides of Loch Tay, about 8 miles, without any other
parish intervening.  It is then intersected, for a very short
space, with Crannich, and part of Ardernaig, in the parishes
