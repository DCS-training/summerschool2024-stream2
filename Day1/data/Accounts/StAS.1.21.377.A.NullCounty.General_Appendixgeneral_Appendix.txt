but the people seem rather displeased with the discovery,
their latter reason overbalancing every other.  In proof of
this observation, Thomas Tennison, Esq. who has a large st-
tate in this district, has, within the last 2 years, erected 3
very fine kilns for burning lime, for the use of his tenants,
as well as his own, and has manured many fields in his pos-
session with lime; the effect was admirable, and yet I think
his tenants profit little by his example.
   The district running east of the lake from Drimshanbo to
Doobally is totally neglected.  The face of the country is the
same it was 200 years ago, except that the woods have been
consumed by Drimshanbo foundery.
   The parts west of the lake, as also the part lying north,

and made several fine ditches.  The Rev. Mr Crawford has
built a good house, and is introducing the cabbage husband-

of industry, by his example, as well as advice, having limed
and divided many waste fields.

or corn has been ever attempted, until this last season, that
Mr Tennison's limed ground has produced very fine barley.
Potatoes rate, in general, at 6 d. per cwt. but this year at 5 d.
The corn is all distilled into spirits.  Many horned cattle are
bred in the vallies, and reared on the mountains, but the
breed is bad.  No sheep are bred here; though I am
tain, if the dry grounds lying between the mountains and
lake were sanded or limed, they would afford an excellent
sweet pasture for these useful animals.
