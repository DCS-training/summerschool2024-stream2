     Statistical Account

common bear from the last period till Whitsunday.  Bar-
ley, bear, and Peebles, or early oats, are reaped from the
end of August to the middle of September, common oats
to the end of October; and sometimes in very late seasons,
and backward weather, the harvest continues till the be-
ginning, nay middle of December, as in 1782.  There
may be about 400 acres in plantations.  Each farm
has a proportion of pasture-ground set apart for the
cattle and sheep; and it must be acknowledged there is
too much waste ground.  There are some inclosures in the
parish; but the greatest part of it is uninclosed, as the
people, though sensible of the benefits of inclosing, cannot
afford the outlay of money necessary for that purpose.

   Rent, Wages, etc.-Best arable or meadow ground lets in
general at 14 s. or 15 s. the acre; inferior, from 5 s. to 10 s.
The rent of the whole parish is above L. 1622. Landed
property is not often changing.  The daily wages of a
labourer in husbandry are 9 d.; in harvest from 1 s. to
1 s. 3 d.; of a carpenter 1 s.; of a masons 1 s. 3 d.; of a
slater 1 s. 2 d.; of a tailor 10 d.  When men and women
are employed for the whole year in husbandry, the wages
of the former are from L. 4 to L. 6, and of the latter, from
L. 2 to L. 2, 10 s. exclusive of victuals and lodging, with
which they are also supplied by their masters.  None have
been obliged to leave the parish for want of employment.
The fuel commonly used in peat, turf, heath, broom, whins,
(all found in the parish), and English coal, landed at Banss
or Portsoy.  There is a very fine clay, of a yellowish
brown colour, (called here clay-marl), to be got in great
quantities, in which very little sand appears.  It is only
used as a compost for manure, or is laid upon grass-ground
with little propriety or judgment.
