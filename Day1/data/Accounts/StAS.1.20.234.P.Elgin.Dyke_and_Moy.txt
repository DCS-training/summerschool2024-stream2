highest, in a place where the river had formerly run.  This 
shews, that the river has been damed up by the drifting of 
sand; and that this had most probably happened during the 
high winds in the last century, which gave the finishing 
stroke to the depopulation of Culbin.  As the river then en-
tered the frith so near to Maviston hills, it is presumable, that 
the sand had then choked and filled up the mouth and bed 
of the river, and this, with concurrence of the first land spet,
has made the river cut its way through the easter end of 
the flat and narrow neck before mentioned, so as to leave it,
with the old town and harbour, on the left side.
   People alive 40 years ago, remembered to have seen the
stones of old Findern removed to the easter side of the new 
channel, and applied in building the first houses of the pre-
sent town, on the Meurton side, from which the old bar,
now contiguous to the parish of Dyke, had been completely 
disjoined. 
   Since the former channel was deserted, both ends of the
old bar have been considerably washed away and shortened 
by the tides.  Some of the stones of the old town, which 
have subsided, are yet to be seen at ebb of tide, in a clear 
day, lying at the bottom of the salt-water, when boats are 
passing over them.  And these remnants of the old houses,
are more than half-a-mile west of where the present town 
stands.

   But though the river forced a direct passage into the sea,
it has not been able to keep a clear channel into the deep 
water.  A new bar, opposite to its present mouth, is 
stretching westward, between which and the old bar, the 
safest access into the present harbour is from the west.
