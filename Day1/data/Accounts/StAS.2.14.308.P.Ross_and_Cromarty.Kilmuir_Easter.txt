    derable quantity of waste land might be advantageously reclaimed.

          There is no land in the parish in a state of undivided common.
        A considerable quantity of butter and cheese is annually made and
        sold, of which it would be difficult to estimate the exact amount and
        value. There are, in all, fourteen farms in the parish, besides a
        number of small holdings, averaging each from 2 to 10 or 12 acres.
        These small holdings are in detached spots, and in general on the
        outskirts of the larger farms.
           Quarries.-Tbere is a quarry of fine white freestone at Kinrive,
        on the property of Kindace, resembling the Craigleith stone, ca-
        pable of a high polish, and very durable. There are likewise se-
        veral quarries of red stone, but much inferior in value to that of
        Kinrive. The quarry of Kinrive extends in a continued ridge to
        Camscurrie, to the north of Tain, a distance of ten or twelve miles.
           Fisheries.--There is no regular fishery of any kind in the pa-
        rish, though there is a village (Portlich), the inhabitants of which
        were once almost all fishers.' The descendants of these people
        have, in general, betaken themselves to trades, and probably find-
        ing a more certain livelihood by these means, have almost entirely
        abandoned fishing, though there are occasionally some boats which
        go from this village to the herring fishing.
