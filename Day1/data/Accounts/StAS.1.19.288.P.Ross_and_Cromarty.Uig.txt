     Statistical Account

   At Melista are the remains of a nunnery, called still in
the language of the country, Teagh na n cailichan dou, or,
The house of the old black women.  At Carlaway there is
a Danish fort, or doune, with a double wall of dry stone; it
is, perhaps, the most entire of any of the kind in Scotland;
it is very broad at the base, and towards the top contracts
in the form of a pyramid; the height of the wall is 30
feet; the fabric is perfectly circular.  In ancient times
there were many battles fought in this parish between the
Macaulays and Morisons, who had perpetual feuds.
   This parish gave birth to the father of Alderman Mac-
aulay, now living in London, whose uncle George Mac-
aulay is still at Calarnish.  The people of this parish are
remarked for their cleanliness and hospitality more than
their equals in any other part of the island.  The number
of boats is not below a hundred.  Two or three open boats
go annually from this parish to Glasgow with salted beef,
dry salted fish, tallow, etc.  The people are very economi-
cal, and are not fond of a military life.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-If manufactures were intro-
duced here upon a great scale, they would tend to melio-
rate the condition of the people, because such employment
would afford bread to the increase of population which pre-
vails here, as well as in all the parishes of the Highlands.
Very near the manse there lives a woman, who has four di-
stinct breasts or mammae.  She has had several stout healthy
children, and suckled each of them, and likewise one of the
minister's children.  She has nipples and milk in each of
the four breasts; the two upper are situated immediately
under the arm-pits, and by being distended with milk, are
very troublesome to her for the first two or three months
after her delivery.  Such a lusus naturae is very uncom-
mon.
