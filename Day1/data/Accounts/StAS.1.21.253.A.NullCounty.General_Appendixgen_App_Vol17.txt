   The estate of Prestongrange was purchased in 1746, at a
judicial sale, by Mr William Grant, then his Majesty's Ad-
vocate, and afterwards one of the Lords of Session and Justi-
ciary, whose eminent talents and humanity will long be grate-
fully remembered.
   The barony of Preston was sold by Sir William Hamilton
to James Oswald of Fingleton about the end of last century:
and Lord Grange purchased it at the beginning of the present
century.  In 1752, it was sold by Lord Grange partly to Wat-
son's Hospital, and to his factor William Ramsay; and in 1770
he sold it to Dr. Ramsay, who had been tutor, first to David
Lord Elcho, and afterwards factor to his Grace the Duke of
Roxburgh; and Mr Shaw purchased the same soon after,
as stated in the volume and page above referred to, of the
Statistical Account of this parish.
   The estate of Northfield, anciently part of the barony of
Preston, was purchased by Mr A. Nisbet, surgeon in Edin-
burgh, about 1722; and was lately sold to James Sime, slater
in Edinburgh, the present worthy proprietor.
   The late Lord Drummore prochased his farm in this parish
some years after; upon which he built a very good house,
and planted and embellished the grounds very elegantly.
Upon his Lordship's death, the Rev. Dr. Finlay bought this
property, which is an ornament to this part of the country.
   The estate of Olivestob (formerly Holystop, now called Bank-
ton) was long the property of another respectable branch of
the great family of Hamilton.  Several of the family of Olive-
stob made a figure both at home and abroad.  Colonel Tho-
mas Hamilton, when a younger brother, served in the Swe-
dish army.  On his return to Scotland, about 1670, he
became an eminent merchant, and was afterwards one of
the magistrates of Edinburgh:  and Lord Kames, in his Law
Tracts, and Lord Fountainhall, in his Decisions, mention him
