     Statistical Account

   Ecclesiastical State.-This is an united parish, as already ob-
served, made up of the original parishes of Moy and Dalaros-
sie.  There is no account, written or traditional, when the
annexation took place; yet, in many respects, the parishes are
distinct and separate, though under the charge of one minister.
There is frill a church kept up in each, in which divine ser-
vice is performed alternately.  These churches are 9 miles dis-
tant from each other: the road is at all times rough, and in
the stormy season, frequently impassable.  The church of
Moy was built in the year 1765, and is still in good repair.
The church of Dalarossie was rebuilt in the year 1790.  Mr.
Rose of Kilravock is accounted patron, and has hitherto al-
ways presented to it.-The stipend is 69 L. 14 s. 2 d., with a
small glebe in each parish.  The manse was built in the year
1765, and has lately received some reparation, which has
made it tolerably comfortable.-All the inhabitants of this
parish are of the Established Church, except a few indivi-
duals, who are of the Episcopal Communion, but commonly
attend divine service in the parish church.

   Schools.-There is a parochial school established in this pa-
rish.  The school-house was rebuilt in 1784, in a pretty suf-
ficient manner.  The salary is 100 L. Scotch.  The school-
master is ordinarily session-clerk, by which he makes about
2 L. 10 s. Sterling annually.  The School fees are, 1 s. for reading
and writing, 1 s. 6 d. for arithmetic, and 2 s. for Latin.  All these
emoluments put together, will make about 20 L. Sterling in
the year.  The poor are much inclined to give a little edu-
cation to their children; but so extensive is the parish, that a
very inconsiderable part of them only can be accommodated
by the parochial school.
