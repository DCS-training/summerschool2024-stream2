pied, will be an important addition to the industry, and po-
pulation of the parish; the work, it is presumed, being as yet

factory manner, a great quantity of britannias, diapers, and
every other sort of cotton and linen cloth.  As labourers
are scarce in this part of the country, the only thing wanting

house-hold cloth, or in working for masters in Perth.

Hay, alias John de Luce, chief of the Hay's, was a native of
this parish.  The inhabitants still point to the village, and
even to the vestiges of the house, in which he lived, when,
