which is also the case with respect to the lime quarries.-
On the estate of WOODSTON, there is another quarry of free-
stone, in every respect resembling that of Laurieston.  The
only advantage, that the latter has, is, that it easily discharges
the rain water that falls into it, owing to a stream that runs
through the den.-There is another quarry at WHITE CRAIGS,
facing the North Esk, from which are turned out stones, of
any dimensions, of a beautiful whitish colour, similar to those
used in the New Town of Edinburgh; but being reckoned too
hard for the mason's chizel, they are used only in ruble build-
ing.  There is another quarry of the scurdy, or whin-stone
kind, in the Heughs of St. Cyrus, of a dark blue colour,
which is also used in ruble building.
   All these quarries are inexhaustible.  The two last men-
tioned are parts of long chains of rocks, which run through
the parish, from W. to E. all the way along the coast.  Near
the E. end of them begins a species of rock, consisting of
pebbles, baked, as it were, with a hard cement, (which we
call the plumb-pudding rock), which continues, with some
interruptions, beyond Stonehaven.-The scurdy rocks, called
the Heughs of St. Cyrus, may perhaps have been in a state
of vitrification at some remote period.  Upon this supposition,
the word scurdy may be a corruption of the scoria, which are
the effects of volcanic fire.  However that may be, the beautiful
pebbles, and spars of different sorts, which are intermixed
with these rocks, deserve to be mentioned, as they are cer-
tainly well worth the attention of those who delight in
mineralogy.

   Cave.-Nigh the fall of the burn of Woodston, on the W.,
there is a natural cave, formed by the rude junction of stu-
penduous rocks, after the manner of a Gothic arch.  The en-
trance to it is on a level with the sea, and the rocks and earth
