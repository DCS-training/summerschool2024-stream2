3 carts, the amount will be 200 horses, 480 cows, and 120
carts.  The carts are always drawn by one horse only.-There
are some sheep, mostly in the upper part of the parish.  They
are supposed not to exceed 5 score.

   Roads and Bridges.-The roads are not in good repair;
and it is not easy to say, how they can be made better.  They
are much hurt by the carriage of coal and lime.  Materials
to mend them are ill to be got.  There are no turnpikes with-
in the parish.-Two bridges over the Avon were both
swept away by one flood, in the year 1771: but they were
rebuilt in a year or two after,-partly by private contributions,
and partly from the county funds.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The produce of the year 1782
sell short of what was necessary, for the consumption of the
parish.  The deficiency was made up, by some of the more
wealthy inhabitants, who purchased foreign grain, and fold it
without profit.-By sobriety, frugality, and a more diligent
attention to business, the difficulties of that unfortunate season,
were got over more easily than could have been expected.-
The parochial school-master has 100 merks of salary, which
at present is paid by 47 different hands.  His perquisites, at an
average, amount to 20 s annually.  The number of his scho-
lars are about 50;-his wages 1s 3 d. per quarter;-one third
is deducted for the vacation quarter.  The amount of the
whole about L. 18:-his payments are ill made; and
something ought to be done, to make his situation more comfor-
table.  He has a house, and school-house allowed him by the
parish.  They were built in 1781; and cost the heritors up-
wards of L. 40.-Besides the parochial school, there is one ge-
nerally at the head, and another, sometimes, at the foot of the 
parish.  The expence is desrayed by the parents of the children.
