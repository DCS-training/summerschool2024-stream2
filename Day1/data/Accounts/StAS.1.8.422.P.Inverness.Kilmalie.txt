largeness of the rock, however, where it is, and some fit trees
on its top, will lead to a discovery of it.

   Cascades.-Just opposite to the rock, where the last men-
tioned cave is, on the other side of the river, there is a most
beautiful cascade, falling down, by a gradual slope, from Be-
nevis, upwards of half a mile before it reaches the bottom of
the valley, where it unites its streams with those of the Nevis.
The appearance of this sheet of water, immediately attracts
one's attention, dilates the heart, and kindles, in the mind,
those lofty and grand sentiments of devotion, and those plea-
sing elevated feelings, which the sublime sound of a cascade,
or the war of many waters, naturally excite.  The windings of
the river,-the verdure of the trees,-the wildness of the
rocks,-the terrific aspect of the hills,-the mist, flying swift-

the lonely situation, remote from human eye,-every thing
conspires to make this fall of water, one of the grandest ob-

which cannot be beheld with so much complacency.  It is,
indeed, awful and sublime; but has too much of the terrible
in its appearance.-About two miles further up the river Ne-
vis, there is another cascade, which, after forcing its way
through hills and rocks, has a fall of, at least, 500 feet per-
pendicular.  It is on the same side of the river with the cave.
This parish, as may naturally be expected, from the number
of hills in it, abounds with cascades, that compose a beautiful
and picturesque scenery.

   Woods.-There can be little doubt, but that the greatest part
of the parish was once over-run with wood.  At present, it is said,
there are about 14,000 acres under it.  The most considerable,
and the most valuable plantation, belongs to Mr. Cameron of
