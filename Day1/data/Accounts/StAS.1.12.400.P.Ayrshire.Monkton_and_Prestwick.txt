     Statistical Account

otherwise disposed of, 399 bolls.  The oats, bear, and barley, 
are reckoned to be of the best quality, and bring a high price 
in the market There is little wheat sown, though in most 
places the soil is sufficiently strong, and when sown, produces 
good crops.  The culture of turnips is only beginning to be 
introduced.  One farmer has sowed 6 or 7 acres, and finds 
his account in it, by feeding black cattle for the market, and 
preparing the soil for bear and wheat, and likewise sending 
them to the market of Ayr.  Potatoes are mostly planted for 
family use, and reckoned to amount to about 23 or 24 acres 
in the whole parish at present, about 13 in Monktown, and 
10 in Prestick. 

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls in 1755, was 1163.  In Monktown there are 6 
heritors, 3 of whom reside.

   The present calculation will not correspond to Dr. Web-
ter's as that account was given to him before the disjunction 
and erection of Newtown.  That the population is greatly 
increased, cannot be doubted, as the farms have been divided 
into small proportions, and new farm houses built.  There 
have been built, 8 new houses in Monktown village, and 4 
new farm houses, besides 2 cotton houses for hand jennies, 1
of them for 9, the other for 6, which employs a considerable 
number of hands within these few years.
