ter which they were barbarously massacred.  The general,
on this occasion, seems to have been a nice casuist:  he
thought he kept his word, by distinguishing between the
discretion of the Estates, (which was the expression made use
of in the treaty), and his own discretion, by which they

sons of the year, with haddocks, whitings, skate, mackerel, etc.
On the water foot or Oariskey, also, there are several hundred
salmon taken in a good season.  The casual mention made
