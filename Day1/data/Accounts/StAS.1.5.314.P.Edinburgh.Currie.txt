name of this parish also has probably given rise to the fir-
name of Corrie or Currie; for anciently it was the prac-
tice for men of property to take their firnames from the
lands they possessed, of which there are numerous ex-
amples in Scotland; while, in modern times, we find this
custom reversed, men of property being now more inclined
to confer their firnames on the property they acquire.

   Situation and Climate.-The situation of this parish is
very elevated.  At Ravelrig, about the middle of it, (but
by no means the highest point,) it is, according to a late
very accurate measurement, not less than 800 feet above
the level of the sea.  This extreme height, and its vici-
nity to the range of the Pentland Hills, renders, it cold and
damp, and, what is a remarkable proof of the moisture of
the atmosphere, there is almost no house in the parish,
however high its site, but displays marks of this state of the
climate internally on the walls.  In spite of this, however,
it is pretty healthy, which may be considered as an effect
of the constant winds that prevail here, and carry off those
feeds of disease, which are generated by the cold and
dampness of the climate.  Rheumatism seems the chief
disorder to which its inhabitants are subject.  But if oc-
casional diseases are not frequent, yet the constitutional
disorder of scrophula, which is still worse, is very preva-
lent here, and the same remark may be extended, it is be-
leived, to all the parishes where the climate is cold and
damp, and where the living of the inhabitants is poor, and
princiapally of the vegetable kind.  The miseries this dis-

the manor of Ingleston, from a pillar dug up there, which place is like-
wise in the vicinity of Curne.  These circumstances tend to prove, that it
must have originally been a Roman station, traces which have lately
been found in the neighbourhood.
