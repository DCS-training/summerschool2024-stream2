   Climate, Surface, Soil and Air.-The lands in both parishes
are in a high situation; the frost begins sooner, the snow falls
earlier, and both continue a longer time than in most of the
neighbouring parishes.  Except on the banks of the river
Dovan, or at the bottom of the hills, where the effect of
the sun is considerable, the northern branch of Fossaway is
the coldest district.  It is one continued range of hills.  The
hills are of various heights, from 600, perhaps to 1100 feet
perpendicular above the level of the sea; yet they afford ex-
cellent pasture, both for sheep and black-cattle.  Some of
the hills have moss and heath; but the greatest part of them
is covered with grass, to the very summit.  Tulliebole, and
the southern branch of Fossaway, lying lower, are warmer.
On these parts, there are some moss, some marshy ground,
and some little hills; but by far the greatest part is arable
land.  The soil is various; some gravelly; some clay; some
silly; some loam; and all these soils are capable of conside-
rable improvement.  Tulliebole, although in appearance it
resembles a plain country, when compared with the hills on
the north and south; yet contains the highest grounds of
any parish in the plain, between Stirling and Kinross.  Here
the springs of water divide themselves, some running west
towards Stirling, others east towards Kinross.  In a dry
summer, there are more frequently flying showers here, than
any where around.  These showers are sometimes seen coming
from the south-west, along the Ochil-hills, and the Cleish
hills at the same time; and when they come opposite to
Tulliebole, a part of them has been observed to separate on
both sides, from the main body of the clouds, and meet on
a rising ground, adjoining to the Crook of Dovan.  From
