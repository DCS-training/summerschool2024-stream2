ling.-There are 11 heritors, many of whom have but little
property in the parish; Mr. Drummond of Perth being pro-
prietor of more than two thirds of it.  Three of them are con-
stant residenters: other three have houses, at which they reside
occasionally; all of whom deserve great praise for what they
have done, in planting, inclosing, and otherwise improving, the
fields that lie around their seats.

   Church, etc.-The church is an old fabric, that has stood for
some centuries, and has often been repaired.  It is said to
have been built by Ochiltree Bishop of Dumblane, before the
Reformation:  The precise year is not known.  It has how-
ever all the marks of antiquity:  The roof is supported by a
double row of pillars, with aisles on each side; and there is a square
steeple at the west end; directly opposite to which, thee is in
the east end a quire, which is a narrow building, with a large
Gothic window.  Near to it, are still to be seen the vestiges
of three steps up to the altar.-The manse is a little out of the
village and was rebuilt about 9 or 10 years ago.  The glebe
consists of 8 acres, and the stipend is about 100 guineas*.-The
patronage is in the Crown, as coming in the room of the Bishop
of Dumblane.  Besides the parish church, there are other
three places of worship, viz. a chapel of ease, a church of
England meeting house, and Popish chapel.  There are also
the remains of a Roman catholic church at Strageath, and a
chapel 2 miles to the southward.

*The present minister is Mr. John Scott, who succeeded his father in April
1767, whose predecessor was Mr. William Hally, the first Presbyterian minister
after the Revolution, and who, for several years after his ordination, was obliged
to preach from a tent in the church-yard, while the Episcopal incumbent kept
possession of the church.
