   The stock of the Royal Infirmary, which in 1750 was
L. 5000, in 1790 was L. 36,000.-This Infirmary admits
above 2000 patients annually; and, on an average, one only
in 25 dies.  This, on comparison with other hospitals, is not
to be equalled in Europe.  An account of the most celebrated
hospitals in Europe has been published; and, in some, 1 in
11 dies; in others, 1 in 13, and 1 in 16.  It is daily attended
by three physicians; and the members of the royal College of 
surgeons attend monthly in their turns.-During the sitting 
of the College, (from October to May), two of the Prosessors
of Medicine give clinical lectures, on the cases of a selected
number of patients.
   In 1763, One hundred students attended the Infirmary.
   In 1791, Three hundred and twenty-three students attend-
ed the Infirmary.
   In 1776, A public Dispensity was built by subscription, and
supported by voluntary contributions.-This charity is for
patients afflicted with chronic diseases, or such as render ad-
mission to an hospital improper or unnecessary.  They receive
advice and medicine gratis; and, in the year 1791, no less
than 15,450 patients had been relieved

   The first spring water brought to supply Edinburgh was in
1681.  A leaden pipe of 3 inches bore was then laid from Co-
miston, about 3 1/2 miles south west of the city, by one Bruschi,
a German engineer, and there was no other pipe completed
till about were found insufficient for supplying the inhabitants;
and, in 1787, an iron pipe of 5 inches diameter was added.-
