			 BORTHWICK.                          187

   The manse, being partly very old, is not in all respect so con-
venient as most of the houses which have recently been erected
or repaired for the use of parish ministers,-but it is a velnerable
mansion,-and at no very distant period must be replaced by one
more suited to the taste of the present times.
  The glebe consists of rather more than 12 acres, some of
which are of excellent soil and arable,-the rest marshy and for-
merly deemed incapable of improvement; but during the, incum-
bency of the present minister, the whole of this part has been drain-
ed, and, with the exception of one small spot, made to carry excel-
lent crops.  It is rented at L. 28 per annum.  The garden is large,
and has a good variety of soil; it produces most abundantly crops
both of the larger and smaller fruits, and has indeed few rivals in
so far as the size and quality of its gooseberies and currants are con-
cerned. Apples, pears, and plums, also thrive well in it, and most
of the common flowers ornament its borders.
   The stipend, besides the manse and other usual appendages con-
sists of 124 bolls, with some additional firlots, pecks, and lippies
of grain-the one-half being barley, and the other oatmeal, and
L. 78 of money.
   The present incumbent is the nineteenth minister who has had
the pastoral superintendence of the parish of Borthwick since the
Reformation.  The following is a list of his predecessor in office
-with the years of their induction and removal:-Mr Thomas
Cranston, 1567-1569 ; Mr John Colthen, 1586 ; Mr James
Hunter, 1593;- Mr, Adam Scott, 1595-1596; Mr John Murray
1596-1603; Mr Patrick Turner, 1604-1629; Mr James Por-
teous, 1629-1651 ; Mr Archibald Turner,1648-1649; Mr John
Weir, 1652-1657; Mr Thomas Paterson, 1657-1688 Mr Tho-
mas Paterson,1683-1689; Mr John Campbell 1689-1690;
Mr William Trail, 1699-1714; Mr William Robertson, 1714-

   Of 300 families, which is about the number in the parish, 60
maybe reckoned as belonging to the Secession-and 240 to the
Established Church. But,Dissenting meeting-houses commonly
are so situated as to draw their attendants from several parishes.
There is one meeting-house of Dissenters in the eastern extremity

great perseverance and success.
