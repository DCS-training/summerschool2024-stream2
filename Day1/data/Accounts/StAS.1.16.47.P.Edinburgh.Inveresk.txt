     of Inveresk.

   Roads.-The roads, too, in the parish are thought to be
in a worse state than any in the county of Mid-Lothian, for
which the magistrates are not to blame, as their street,
which make /4ths of a mile of the post road, are kept in
very good order.  Considering how largely the inhabitants
of this parish contribute to the roads, by paying at the
turnpike gates between this and Edinburgh and Leith. and
that the very numerous carriages of the parish have for
many years been under the direction of the county, this
seems very unaccountable.  The roads leading to the coal
pits are kept in better order, which is of much advantage
to the inhabitants, not merely for their own supply with
fuel, but for the fake of a great number of people, who
earn their livehood by the carriage of that article*.  The
pavement or causeway of the streets is kept in tolerable
good order; but the foot paths in wet weather are shamefully 
dirty, which is the more inexensable, as the town
draws above L. 70 per annum for the dung of the streets,
which formerly were a charge to them.  It may likewise
be observed here, that too little attention is paid to the 
accommodation of trades people and labourers, who have occation
to travel so frequently to the neighbouring town of
Dalkeith.  Forty years ago, when the fields were uninclosed,
the road to that town from Fisherrow was a mile
nearer than it is now.  The road from Musselburgh has
likewise been much lengthened by means of inclosures.
The road is narrow, and the people who travel on foot are
forced to go, for at least a mile, in mud over the shoes, between
two walls or hedges, or to break over the fences; a
little attention, and a very small expence, might rectify
this.

through the parish.
