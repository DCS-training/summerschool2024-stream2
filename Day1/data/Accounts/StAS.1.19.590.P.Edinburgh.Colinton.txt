The air is salubrious, and the soil in general dry, without
any ground fogs or stagnating water.

   River.-On the river of Collington, which rises on the
north side of the Pentland Hills, and after a course of about
16 miles, runs into the sea at Leith, there is much of that
romantic scenery for which the small rivers in Scotland are

of about 10 miles it drives the following Mills:

           Barley-mills,    12
           Flour-mills,     20
           Lint-mills,      2
           Wauk-mills,      5
           Paper-mills,     4
           Snuff-mills,     5
           Leather-mills,   2
           Saw-mills,       7
                   Total,  71

   Agriculture.-The husbandry here is entirely regulated
by the supply of dung which is brought from the city of
Edinburgh.  This local advantage leads to a peculiar me-

   Cattle.-The number of work-horses in the parish is about
