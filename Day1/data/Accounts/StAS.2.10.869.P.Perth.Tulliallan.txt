 Agriculture.-The arable land in this parish is in a state of
yearly improvement.

   Imperial acres, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, about 305     5
                  remaining waste or in pasture,                         2     0

   The valued rent is about L. 2589, 9s. 6d.  Scotch, but the real
rental of the landward part of the parish is L.4549, 5s. 4d.  Ster-
ling, and this added to the rental of the town, which is L.1772,
14s., makes the whole rental of the parish L.6322, 1s. 4d.  The
average rent of land per acre is about L.2, 1Os.  The most im-
portant improvement in the parish for the last twenty years, is the
addition made to the arable land by two extensive embankments,
one on the west, the other on the east of the town of Kincardine.
The former of these was commenced by the late Lord Viscount
Leith, in the spring of 1821, and was completed in 1823.  The
length of this embankment is 2020 yards.  It height is 11 feet
6 inches above the level of the river Forth.  The land thus re-
claimed is equal to 152 imperial acres, and the expense of the
embankment was L.6104, Os. 7d.  The other embankment to the
east of the town, extending from the shipping pier on the west to
Longannat point on the east, is in length 3040 yards, or nearly
one mile and three-quarters. Its height averages 16 feet.  The
land reclaimed is equal to 214 acres of alluvial mud, which, when
the salt is extracted, will bear the richest crops.  This embank-
ment was commenced by the Trustees of the late Lord Viscount
Keith, in 1829, by a stone embankment, by way of a break-water,
and was finished with a head embankment inside the stone in
1839.  The work proceeded slowly, in order to allow an accumu-
lation of mud inside, and the tide water which deposited the mud,
was not excluded until the month of January 1838.  This em-
bankment cost nearly L.14,000, and is regarded by competent
judges to be one of the best in Scotland.  The land thus reclaim-
ed constitutes a new farm, and is a great improvement to the
parish.  The soil is strongly impregnated with salt, which must
be extracted by the sun, rain, and frost, before vegetation com-
mences, and the first plants which appear on the surface are
always those which are to be found in salt-marshes, and on the
shores of the sea.
