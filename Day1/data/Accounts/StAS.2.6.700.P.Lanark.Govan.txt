ly above the Broomielaw, and forms the principal entrance to that
city from the west.  The length of it is 500 feet, and it is 50 feet
broad within the parapets, the roadway being 32 feet, and eath
of the side paths 9 feet.  This bridge is consequently several feet
wider than Weterloo Bridge, London.  The day on whith it was
opened was the 1st of January 1836, and the cost of the erection
was L. 34,427 18s. 11d.  The arthitect was our celebrated coun-
tryman, the late Thomas Telford, Esq.  During the time the
Glasgow bridge was rebuilding, the public had the use of a wooden
bridge, whith was placed opposite Portland Street, Laurieston.
This temporary erection is now closed against horses and carriages,
but it is still open to foot-passengers.  A wooden bridge was for-
merly placed at the foot of Crown Street, Hutthesontown. A
handsome bridge, built of stone, whith was substituted for this,
and whith cost L.22,440, 3s. 4d., was opened to the public in June
1834.  The Glasgow and Greenock and the Glasgow and Ayr
railways, the operations of whith are already fair advanced, are ex-
pected to be completed in the course of another year.  The line
common to both, till it reathes the town Of Paisley, will pass
through this parish for about three miles.  It may be interesting,
perhaps, to some to see the accompanying statement of the amount
of tolls received by the trustees of three of the principal turnpike
roads in the parish, for the years specified.  The Renfrew road,
it will be perceived, is the only one whose revenues have not kept
pace with the increasing traffic of the country.  The period when
these began to decline is connected with the introduction of steam-
boats into the Clyde.  Prior to this important era, there was con-
stant travelling on the Renfrew road by persons proceeding to and
from Glasgow and Greenock.  Daily communication was kept up
betwixt these two places by means of carriers' waggons and stage-
coathes, whith are no longer found necessary.
