4 tenants: all of them should be restricted to 2 occupiers.
The reason is, that 4 tenants, with their families, are too
great an expence upon the land, which is not able to support
them properly, and pay the rent.  Reduce the tenement to 2
families, and both have a comfortable subsistence; they have
a greater interest in the object; the little contentions which al-
ways distract 4 are reduced to 2, and therefore a greater unani-
mity subsists: the 4 also, by having too much time upon their
hands, are perpetually turning up the ground not in heart, and
that ought to lie fallow; their labour in fact is not worth 3 d.
per day; whereas, at real day labour under a master, they
might earn 1 s.

   State of the People, Productions, etc.-The population of
this country cannot properly be said to be upon the decline,
except as to one particular, and that is, the monopoly of a
number of grass farms in the hands of single individuals.  The
high price of cattle, for some years back, is the cause of this
check upon population.  There are single men who occupy
some 8 and some 10 tenements, upon each of which there is
only one herd.  This misfortune would not be so very much
to be lamented if there monopolizers had actually enriched
their country in the same proportion that they have been the
means of reducing the number of its inhabitants.  If the men
must take their departure, the least apology should be, that a
greater number of cattle are raised: this is by no means the
case; for, if 1 or 2 tenements out of 8 or 10 are excepted, these
ingrossers of land breed no cattle: their chief employment is
to purchase cattle, and to prepare them for the Scotch and
English markets.
   There are very few real good cattle bred in the country, tho'
so very well calculated for the purpose.  The proprietors of
land, such as reside upon the spot, for the accommodation of
