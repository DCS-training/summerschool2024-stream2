on the south, next the recess, a row of laburnums, now of a
large size.  North of the court were the offices, and in front,
up to the high road, distant about half a mile, extended an
avenue pointing to that end of the nearest hill, where, with
an almost equal arch and the same brightness of unbroken
verdure, the northern hill of Spittal, on the other side of the
Old Spittal House, passes behind it, and dips from the view.
At some distance from the pigeon-houses, this was crossed
by another avenue at right angles, stretching south-east and
north-west.  Behind the house was a small level green, sur-
rounded by a terrace-walk, terminating in an arbour to the
east beneath which are some very old elder or bowertrees,
laburnums, and birdcherries.  This arbour looks over the
new washing-house, on the holm and river winding far be-
low, before it turns round the Steel, that like a gently in-
clined plain, crossing an opening in the glen, shows its higher
bank beyond, on this side of the lake.  On the other side of
the farthest Spittal Hill, the Esk takes its rise, and about a
mile and a half west, forcing its way midst rough and pointed
rocks, in a deep ravine through the Pentland ridge, betwixt
the south hilt of Spittal and Carlops, above where it is crossed
by a bridge under the high road, it turns directly eastward
to the Frith of Forth.  Above this bridge have been found
several pieces of very rich iron ore; and a great way up
the Carlops Hill, is a strong petrifying spring.  From this
bridge, following the shape of a glen in which it is situated,
runs a village, begun in 1784, with a triangular area at the
turn of the pass or den about its middle, and a street, stretch-
ing from it to the bridge, and also southwards, forming part
of the high road 60 feet wide.  Most of the houses are
covered with tiles and slates.  Having purled its way from
the bridge, beneath the wooded craggs of the Spittal Hill,
and a steep part of the high road called Woodbrae, the river
