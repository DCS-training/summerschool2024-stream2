   This hill has been long famous for the number of pebbles
found in it, consisting of fine agates, onyx, and a few corne-
lians.
   There is a steep and hollow descent betwixt two tops of the
hill, which is called the Windy Gowle.  Near to this place, in
certain positions, there is a remarkable echo, that repeats
above 9 times; and on the face of the hill there is a cave, in

mon people, that Sir William Wallace hid himself in this
hole of the rock, when he absconded for some time.

yearly wages of a plough-man have increased at least one
