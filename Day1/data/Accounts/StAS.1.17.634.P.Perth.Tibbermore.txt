   The principal crops are oats, barley or bear, and clover
with rye-grass.  Wheat also, though not hitherto universally
cultivated, is becoming every year more common.  A preju-
dice was long entertained against sowing wheat upon fields
that are naturally wet, from an idea that such a soil, when
swelled with the winter rains, would be apt to cast out the
roots of the young plants; but experience has clearly shewn
that this objection, however specious in theory, is not entitled
to much practical regard;-where early sowing has been at-
tended to, the wetness of the soil has seldom, if ever, prov-
ed fatal to the crop of wheat.  Pease and beans having been
found precarious crops, are rather less cultivated than they
were some time ago.  Turnips, though not altogether ne-
glected, are neither a general crop, nor raised in great quan-
tities.  Where the fields are wet, the farmer is afraid of
poaching the soil, in carting them off during the winter; be-
sides, the consumption of the butcher market of Perth is by
no means equal to the supply of fat cattle which the wide
and rich country around is capable of affording; and many
farmers, who might otherwise have large fields of turnips,
are thereby induced to content themselves with such a quan-
tity as they find to be useful in rearing their young Lock.
The quantity of potatoes is inconsiderable, being cultivated
chiefly for family use.  Flax is by no means a crop high in
the farmer's estimation; besides the trouble attending it, it

spirit superior to their former condition, gradually enlarged
their views, raised, in some sense, their rank in society, and thus
prepared them to devise and execute such plans of improvement
as man in a more depressed situation, will never attempt.
