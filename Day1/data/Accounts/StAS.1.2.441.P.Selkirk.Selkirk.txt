firs, however, from their resinous nature, (if such plantations
are weeding) will be found still more effectual*.
   The other disease, known only within these 50 years, is of
a much more alarming nature, as it affects not only our whole
stocks, but the shepherds and their dogs.  It is a species of
tick, with which our pastures swarm.  They begin to appear
about the end of March, and retire about the middle of Au-
gust.  Unlike to the other animals of the blood-sucking tribe,
which fall off when full, these seldom let go the hold, till, if
their number is sufficient, they drain the whole blood in the
body of their suffering victim.  Numbers of sheep, of all ages,
but especially the young, die of this disease.  The sheep too,
that survive it, pestered with these vermin, feed not to the
condition or value they otherwise would.  Burning the benty
pastures where they breed in the spring, is found to lessen the
evil; but no means are yet discovered by which it can be era-
dicated.  An experiment was tried, last year, by a farmer in
this parish, who anointed the bare part of the thigh of six of
the most diseased lambs in his flock with mercurial ointment;
and the shepherd, who was to observe the consequence, de-
clared, that the following day he carefully examined them, and
found not a single tick upon one of them; and being further
desired to watch if they remained clean, declared they did.-
Should this remedy prove effectual, it will cost only a halfpen-
ny per sheep*.

will kill these vermin when on the skin.  In the pasture, liming,
or watering, will answer the purpose effectually.
