The only antiquity* worth remarking, is a large artificial
cave, dug out of a bold rocky eminence, on the banks of the
river Calder, in the estate of Monkland, in a molt romantic
and sequestered spot, and which seems to have been a very
laborious undertaking.  But whether it has been intended as
an asylum in barbarous times, or the abode of the melan-
choly hermit, tradition is perfectly silent, although the for-
mer is most probable.

*There were also to be seen, a few years ago, the remains
of a Roman Catholic chapel, at a place called Kipps, which was
destroyed at the Reformation.  At this chapel, the abbots of
Newbottle held annual courts, for levying the rents and feus of
the hundred pound land of the barony of Monkland, then be-
longing to the Abbey of Newbottle; but this venerable monu-
ment of antiquity is now demolished, a more than rustic farmer
having lately removed the walls, and turned the scite of it into a
corn field.  Upon a rising ground, there is still to be seen an up-
right granite stone, where it is said, in former times, they burns
those imaginary criminals, called witches.
