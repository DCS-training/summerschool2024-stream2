     of Blair-Atholl and Strowan.

   Crops.-The principal crops are barley, oats, potatoes, and
flax, with some pease and rye.  In high, wet, and late grounds,
they use early oats.  The proprietors, and such tenants as
have inclosed land, sow turnips, clover, and rye-grass.  The
feed-time and harvest are rather late, than otherwise, espe-
cially in the glens.  Grain of all kinds is dearer here, than in
the low countries.  Some fruits is raised; but the country,
in general, is too high and frosty for orchards.

   Imports and Exports.-The common imports are feed-corn,
of the different kinds, meal, and barley for a few stills.  The
potatoes have considerably lessened the demand for meal.  As
to foreign articles, they are the same as people of the same
rank and abilities import elsewhere.  Our exports are a few
black cattle, sheep, and linen-yarn.  It was this last article
which principally brought ready money into the country, to
pay the rents.  The materials were raised at home; and almost
every one had a share in that business.  It has already felt the
baneful effects of the cotton manufactures, the materials of
which are brought from afar, and by which few gain in pro-
portion.

   Church, etc.-The Duke of Athol is patron.  The stipend
consists of L. 55: 17 in money, and glebes that are reckoned
worth L. 20;-in all L. 75: 17 sterling.

   Poor.-By a gift and mortification of the Marquis of A-
thol's dated in 1687, provision was made, in meal and mo-
ney, for six poor men in the parish; which is now divided a-
mong eight men, presented by the Duke, as follows:  Six men
have each 2 bolls of oat meal, and L. 4 Scots, yearly, and each
of the other two has L. 8: 6: 8d. Scots.  The number of the
other poor, who receive alms, is at an average, about 75.
