confined here, three for rioting, and two for theft.  The longest
period any of them was confined here was ten days.
   Fairs.-There are three fairs held in the parish, the Peters-
mas, in the end of June; the Georgemas, in July; and the Mary-
mas, in the beginning of September.  They are intended chiefly
for the sale of cattle and sheep.
   Inns and Alehouses.-There are 2 or 3 inns and about 30 ale-
houses in the parish.  These last cannot but have an injurious ef-
fect; but it is hoped both their number and their influence are
decreasing.
   Fuel.-A good deal of English coal is used in the town of
Thurso; but many of the town's people, and all the people in the
country, with a few exceptions, consume nothing but peats.
These are to be found in abundance in the parish; and the tenants
have a right to take of them at no other cost but that of the time
and labour, (which, however, are considerable,) required for cast-
ing them and carrying them home.
