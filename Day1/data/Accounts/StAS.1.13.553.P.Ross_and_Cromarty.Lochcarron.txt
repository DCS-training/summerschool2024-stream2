   Long Leases. -The greater part of the people of Lochcar-
ron have lately got leases for 25 years.  This has excited
a spirit of industry and improvement. They are now build-
ing comfortable houses, and turning their lands to the best
advantage.  The great error, hawever, of the Highland
farmers is overstocking.  If they kept only two cows for
every three they do at present, they would improve their
breed of cattle, and be in no danger of losing them by se-
vere winters or springs.  Three bad cows will devour more
grass and straw than two good ones, but will never fetch
as good a price from any drover.  The price of cattle was
very high for some years pass.  A highland cow would 
sell for L.5 or L.6, and sometimes for L.7 sterling.  If
this be a good cause for augmenting the rents, it is to be
hoped, that propietors will see that the fall of the price of
cattle, when that happens, is a good cause for diminishing
them again.

were let blood in the fever, it had the appearance, when
it congealed, of the blood of a boiled pudding, or of an ug-
ly kind of jelly.  Their breath smelled strong of fish.  In
