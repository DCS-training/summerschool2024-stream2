where very particular attention is paid, L. 4: 10: 0.  The
cows are, at an average, from 26 to 30 stones weight.  The
cows being generally housed, their dung is carried to crosts
in the vicinity, which occasions the proportion of outfield to

Linton.

old breeding ewes, at Martinmas, about (1 s.; the wool about
1 s. per stone dearer than at Linton.  Scarcely any ewe milk
cheese is made for sale in the parish.
