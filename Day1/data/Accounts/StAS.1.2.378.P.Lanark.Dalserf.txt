toes; but in the vallies, where this root succeeds exceeding 
well, and is of an excellent quality, it has been carried to
considerable extent, and with great success.  The produce of
an acre has been found to weight, from 12 to 13 tons, and ge-
nerally sells, upon the ground, at from L.10 to L.14 sterling.
Indeed every where the husbandmen cultivate them less or more;
and where circumstances admit, raise them, not only for the
use of their families, but for feeding cattle, particularly milch-
cows:  The inhabitants of the villages also, rent spots of land in
their neighbourhood, by the year, for raising this root.
   The management of the dairy, in making butter ad cheese,
and fattening calves, has been diligently studied, and much

profits, on a milch-cow, are from L.3 to L.4.

is impossible to give an accurate account of the quantity of
land, annually applied to any particular purpose, or of the a-

extensive orchards are planted, and every hedge and fence is
filled with plumb trees; even the tenants along the sides of
the Clyde, have all large orchards near their houses.  The
fruit generally come to great perfection, and are exceedingly
well flavoured.  The whole are, some years, worth about
L. 400 sterling, and are mostly sold at Glasgow and Paisley;
