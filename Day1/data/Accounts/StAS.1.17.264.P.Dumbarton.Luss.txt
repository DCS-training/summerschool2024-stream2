to 360,000 states, and from the latter quarry, from 100,000
to 170,000 slates have been annually exported.  Some of
them were sent to Greenock, Glasgow, and Paisley, but
the greater part to the banks of the Leven, and across Loch-
1omond to Stirlingshire.  The slates are of an excellent qua-
lity, and were sold at from 1 L. 4 s. to 1 L. 15 s. the thou-
sand.  From 10 to 20 hands have been employed in the
Camstraddan quarry, and about 10 in the other.  Some of
them work upon days wages; but the greater part by the
piece.  They commonly get at the rate of 15 s. per 1000,
and it takes 1 s. 4 d. per 1000 to lead the slates from the
quarry to the shore.  In the south end of the parish there
is likewise a very good free-stone quarry, from which the
stones to the house of Rosedoe, and the other principal houses
in the parish have been taken; but it is only wrought occa-
sionally.

   Manufactures.-In 1790, a cotton-mill was erected near
the village of Luss.  It is of the size most suitable to the
place, sufficiently large to give bread to such as might other-
wise be in want of employment, but not to give encourage-
ment to the vices which are so apt to abound, wherever a
promiscuous multitude of people are assembled.  From 30
to 40 hands, young and old, have been usually employed in
it.  Of late, owing to the general stagnation of trade, little
work has been carried on in it.  A thread manufacture, upon
a small scale, is likewise carried on at Dunfin, near the south
end of the parish.

   Antiquities.-About a mile and a quarter south from Luss,
there are the remains of a large cairn, or heap of stones,
called Carn-ma-cheasoig, or, the Cairn of St. Kessog, who is
said, at an early period, to have suffered death there, and
