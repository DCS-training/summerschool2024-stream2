be ploughed, a more permanent and steady system of improvement
may be expected to proceed. A good deal of attention has been
directed to improvement by top-dressing with lime, and draining
the extensive meadow lands for hay. The same system should ex-
tend to the low-situated rough pastures. No fences should be
erected, excepting to be well kept. These improvements, parti-
cularly the liming, require great outlay on the part of both pro-
prietor and tenant; and they can only be attended to on the part
of the latter, where the farms are moderately and under-rented.
Should there be no great depression in the price of farm produce,
there is every reason to expect, that, from the encouragement by
the landlords, and increasing intelligence of the tenants on this
class of farms, a steady system of improvement will proceed;--al-
though it may be noticed, that, hitherto in this district, in general
these mixed cattle farms in cold districts have made much less ad-
vance in value by improvement and management, than either the
dry arable farms of the lower country, or the more elevated and
extensive sheep farms.
	A circumstance may be mentioned, which will explain why the
above species of farms has not, in many instances, thriven in this
parish. The buying and selling of their black-cattle, a necessary
part of the business of the farmers, has led to the habit of frequent-
ing markets on all occasions, and ultimately to cattle-dealing, upon
which, consequently, has followed inattention to their farms, and
in too many cases, from the precarious nature of the business, loss
and ruin. The changes, however, in the tenantry have already
not been numerous from this or any other cause;--there being,
since the peace in 1815, only two or three farms out of nearly
forty in the parish, which have changed occupants.
	Produce.--The average amount of raw produce raised in the
parish may be stated as follows:--
