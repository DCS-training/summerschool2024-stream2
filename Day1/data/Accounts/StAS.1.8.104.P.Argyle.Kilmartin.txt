   Church.-The living, as modified by decreet in the year
1765, is 1000 L. Scotch, including communion elements; a
considerable part being in victual, make it, communibus annis,
about 100 L. Sterling, with the glebe, which is supposed to be
legal as to extent, with 4 sourns grass, in common with the
cattle of the farm.  The grass is not considered as worth 10 s.
each sourn, in the year, notwithstanding the great, rent of grass
lands, that a cow's grass cannot be got below 25 and 30 s. on
some of the pasture farms.-The Duke of Argyll is patron.-
The church was built in the year 1601.  The walls are strong,
but the plan is incommodious.  It is a long narrow stripe,
and has had no reparation or improvement since it was built,
except giving it a new roof.  The pulpit is a curiosity, and is
thought not to he matched in Scotland.  It is an old Gothic
structure of stones and lime, about 7 feet from the level of the
floor, and is coeval with the church.  The manse was built in
the year 1789, and is a tolerable commodious house.

   Schools and Poor.-There is a parochial school, with a sa-
lary of 14L. 4s., made up by 6d. on the pound valuation, and
mortified money, besides session emoluments and quarter wages.
The number of scholars will be, in winter, from 80 to 90;
but fewer in summer.  There is also a society school, with 9L.
salary, attended by about 40 scholars in winter.  The taste
here does not run much on the learned languages, there being
few gentlemen's children.-The number of poor upon the pa-
rish list. is generally from 28 to 32.  There is no established
fund for them besides the church collections; and in a country
parish, where there are but few gentry, and the lower class
of tenants rather poor, and rarely having money in their hands,
the collection must be very inconsiderable.  The principal
tacksmen do not reside.  This small fund, may, with the sa-
cramental collection, amount to 10L. or 12 L. a-year, and is dis-
