   Rain.-The quantity of rain that falls in any district is regulat-
ed chiefly by the absolute humidity of the air; but it is modified
in a considerable degree by the local circumstances which con-
tribute to produce an intermixture of the different strata of the
atmosphere, particularly the vicinity of lofty mountains, and the
vicissitudes of temperature. The hills around Perth being of mo-
derate elevation, the quantity of rain observed to fall in the imme-
diate neighbourhood of the town seems to correspond pretty nearly
with the mean quantity for the latitude.
   The following table exhibits the mean quantity of rain for each
month, derived from a period of rix years, viz. from the begining
of 1829 to the close of 1834, together with the deviations in ex-
cess and defect during the period:-

   The columns entitled "deviations in excess and defect" ex-
hibit the extent to which the extreme quantity of rain for each
month has most exceeded or fallen short of the monthly mean
during the entire period of observation; and the column entitled
"total range" shows the difference between the greatest and least
quantity for each month during the same time. Hence it appears,
that the greatest anomalies with respect to rain occur in different
seasons in the month of July; and the smallest in November.
The former is to be ascribed to the partial but heavy rains which

within certain limits the results of observation; for it is deserving of remark, that
while no explanation founded on physical principles is assigned as the basis of the ex-
pression, the formula fails in its application to some important cases,  particularly in
determining the temperature of places to the leeward of mountain range, within  the
greatest c    whi kewrding to the blypotbm" am in 8V
tropics. The meridian of greatest cold, which, according to the hypothesis, are in 80\g
east longitude, in the case of the Asiatic pole; and in 100&deg; of west longitue, in the
case of the Ameriam pole; are, in each continent, to the leeward of the loftiest
mountain ranges by which they are traversed, nearly in a meridional direction; be
ing the very positions where we ought to expect, according to the views given in the
text, the commencement of the depressed temperature that is experienced to the east-ard of the Stoney Mountains in America, and of the Uralian mountains in Asia.
On the other hand, should it be established by subsequent observations, that the me-
ridians of greatest cold advance to the westward of the chain of these mountains, the
hypothesis of Sir David Brewster woul acquire some claim to the attention of phi-
losophers, however little it may be supported at present by any known analogies.
