     of West-Calder.

of the Cairn hills, this parish is exposed to considerable de-
grees of cold and mouisture.  The chief storms of wind and
rain are from the south and south-west.

   Agriculture and Produce.-The modes of agriculture most
generally practised, in all probability have been nearly the
same, since any part of the parish was cultivated.  Hence
agriculture, except in those instances when the common me-
thods are departed from, is in its simplest and rudest state.
The whole process consists of spreading dung on lee; allowing
it to lie for some time on the surface, and then taking three
or four crops of oats.  After this, the field lies three or four
years in grass, and the process begins again.  In place of
dung, the middle of a high ridge, is sometimes opened with
the plough, and the furrow mixed with lime, and spread
over the surface.  It is somewhat astonishing, that notwith-
standing this mode of agriculture, the farmer frequently
reaps apparently luxuriant crops; and perhaps the only pro-
bable way of accounting for it is, that in many intances, the
crop is not sufficiently ripe to exhaust the manure.  The
farmers here have discovered, that lime acts as a powerful
solvent on all kinds of mossy earth; and they have applied
the discovery, with great success to the purposes of agricul-
ture.  The spirit of improvement has now begun to reach
this place.  The soil in many cases, has been by some of the
intelligent proprietors ameliorated, by enclosing with double
rows of hedges and ditches, leaving a considerable space be-
tween, to be filled up with young trees, adapted to the cli-
mate.  This has served the double purpose of enriching the
soil, and rendering the appearance of the country more beau-
tiful. One proprietor in particular, has improved his grounds
on the best principles of agriculture; and he has succeeded
in raising turnips, and in a proper rotation of crops.
