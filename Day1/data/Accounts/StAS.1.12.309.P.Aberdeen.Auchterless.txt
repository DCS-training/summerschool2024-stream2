for a certain number of short and long carriages, i.e. errands
with horses and carts; a certain number of reapers a day in
harvest, and plough yokings and harrowing on the heritor's
mains.  These are all estimated as part of rent.  On other e-
states few of these are exacted.  On estates where the proprie-
tors live at a distance, the customs and carriages are convert-
ed.  These services and customs are great discouragements and
hardships on the industrious improving tenant, which, it is
to be hoped, will, ere long, become obsolete.

   Agriculture, etc.-About 20 years ago, oxen-ploughs were
mostly in use.  Now there are only 14 oxen-ploughs in the
parish.  The improving tenants, in general, use the light Eng-
lish plough, drawn by 2 horses, of which some employ 3 or 4.
Though the expense of horses is great, yet the large quanti-
ties of meal and bear they carry to market, or a sea-port, and
the great quantity of lime they bring home for their grounds,
obliges them to use horses for every purpose.  Double carts
for some years have been used by all the farmers who have
strong horses.  Oats, bear and pease, are the only kinds of
grain sown here, principally the two first.  Of these great
quantities are raised, and much meal exported every year.  Ex-
tensive fields are laid out yearly for hay and pasture.  The
grass-seeds are sown in with bear or oats; what is designed
for hay is generally after turnip, of which large quantities are
sown, some in broad cast, some in drills.  The turnips are
used for feeding, not only for the butcher and their own fa-
milies, but principally for their young cattle, which the far-
mer finds much more for his advantage; as being fed on tur-
nip through the winter and spring, and full grazing in the
summer, they rise to a considerable size, and bring from 5 L.
to 7 L. or upwards, at 3 years of age.  Potatoes are planted in
great abundance on every farm and croft.  Upon the S. side
