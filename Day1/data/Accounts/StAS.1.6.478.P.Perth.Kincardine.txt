it*.
   Kincardine is situated in the widest part of the valley called
the Strath of Monteath, which is bounded in the N. and W.
by a part of the Grampian mountains.  Among these Ben-
Lomond on the W. Ben-Lady on the N. W. Ben-Vor-
lich and Stoontachrone on the N. are the most conspicuous.
-On the S. the valley is bounded by a chain of hills, com-
mencing near Bannockburn, and stretching S. W. towards
Dumbarton.  On the E. are the Ochills, which are separated
from the Grampian mountains, by Srath Allan, and from the
S. hills by the carse of Stirling, in which stand the detached
rocks of Abbey craig, Stirling capped with the castle, and Craig
Forth.  These altogether afford such a variety fo striking ob-
jects, so well disposed, as very rarely to be equalled.
   There has not been any measurement made of the whole pa-
rish; but it is computed to contain somewhat more than 6000
acres.  The soil is distinguished ordinarily into Carse and dry-
field.-The Carse, containing about 4000 acres, lies along the
Forth, and the dry-field, containing about 2000 acres, along
the Teath.-Only one half of the Carse is arable, the re-
mainder being covered by the mosses of Kincardine and Flan-
ders.  Its general appearance is that of a dead flat.-And
its soil is a rich blue clay, beyond any depth that has been
examined, excepting one corner, where a bed of gravel rises
near the surface, as it approaches the Teath, and dips to-
wards the Forth at the rate of one foot in the hundred.-
There are many thin beds of shells, particularly of oysters, at
different depths in the Carse, and one of considerable thickness
at the bridge of Goody, which is in that part of Kilmadock, that
