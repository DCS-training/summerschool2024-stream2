   Seed-Time and Harvest.- Wheat is sown from the end
of October to the middle of November:  oats, pease, and
beans (the two last are not much cultivated), from the be-
ginning to the end of April:  barely, potatoes, and lint-
seed in small quanties, for private use, from the end of
April to the 25th of May:  turnip from the middle to the
end of June.  The beginning and end of harvest varies,
according to the seasons and situations within the parish.
Oats of the early kind sown here, on the 7th of April,
have been cut down the first week of August.  But, in
general, the harvest does not commerce before the end of
August, nor is concluded before the end of October.  The
lateness is owing to the wetness and coldness of the soil
in the higher situations, and perhaps also to the custom
of sowing later than in other parts of the country.
   The crops are cut down with the common fickle, the
farm of Woodhouseless excepted.  Mr. Bell, the tenant,
has for many years past used the scythe, fitted up for the
purpose.  By which mode, he has found from experience,
that much grain and sodder are saved.  He affirms, that 
two mowers, and three attendants for collecting and sheav-
ing the corn thus cut, will do more work, and to better
purpose, than double that number in the other way.  This
gentleman possesses one of the principal farms in the pa-
rish; which, by his superior skill and unremitting atten-
tion to all the operations of farming, he has brought from
the worst to the highest state of improvement.  Mr. Bell
has the merit of having first introduced into his parish
the improvement of land by turnip and clover; of both
which he raises the best crops in the country.
   Of late years, the tenants who possess the best lands,
have been laying down their fields into grass, upon the
