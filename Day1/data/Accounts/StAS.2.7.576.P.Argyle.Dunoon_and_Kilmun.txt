         While the above table distinctly enough shows, that, accoi-didg

to the number of days throughout the year on which it occurs,
the east is the prevailing wind, yet it must be also considered that,
throughout the greater part of the year, the winds are exceedingly
variable, and the south-west is by far that most experienced, as bring-
ing both rain and heavy gales. During the winter and spring
months, till towards the end of March, it may be said that the
south-west, varying to west and north-west, prevails; and during
the month of April, sometimes commencing earlier, onwards to
the middle and frequently till the end of May, easterly winds pre-
vail, when the winds again become very vari`ble till the coill-
was unwearied and constaut, and its accuracy may be most fully relied upon. The
register itself is a daily one; and the average results of each month, as exhibited in the
table, have beln very carefully drawn out and collated. The term "frosty" is to be
understood as indicating a day on whicb there was any froat, the thermometrical ob-
servation of the day allowing the degree of it.
