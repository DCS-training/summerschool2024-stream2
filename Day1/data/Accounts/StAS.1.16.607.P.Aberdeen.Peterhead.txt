     of Peterhead.

   Thirty years ago, peat-stacks and dunghills stood on the
principal streets in front of the houses; there nuisances are
now removed, and it is allowed by strangers to be as clean
and neat in its appearance as any town in Scotland.
   The houses are not magnificent, but they are commo-
dious and elegant, and are built of the finest granite, which
is dressed so as to have a most agreeable appearance, and
remains long without being sullied by the weather.
   Near the head of the principal street, where the tolbooth
formerly stood, is an elegant town house, 60 feet long and
40 feet wide, with a spire, which is 110 feet from the
threshold to the ball; within the spire there is an excellent
bell and a very fine clock.  This house has cost L. 1600,
and before being finished, will cost L. 2000 Sterling.

   Water.-There is no soft water in the town.  This is
inconvenient for the purposes of washing, and deprives the
inhabitants of one great luxury, the pleasure of drinking
pure spring water, and this circumstance is peculiarly dis-
agreeable to strangers.
   The water within the town is seldom used for tea; wa-
ter for that purpose is brought from a well about 70 yards
eastwards from the manse, where there is a eastern which
was formerly open, and where people employed to carry
the water dipped their ankers very freely, without much
attention to cleanness.  That nuisance is now removed;
the eastern a few years ago was covered; the water taken
from this well is not soft, but it is pleasant to the taste,
and is supposed to extract the taste and flavour of tea bet-
ter than water that is much softer.  It has for time im-
memorial been called the Tea Well, and many people
subsist entirely by carrying water from it to the town.
   The water in the town, and at a small distance from it,
is found from a long experience to be well calculated for
