tells us,* that, "In Clydesdale at present if you will
"ask the common people about any ancient castle or the
"like, they will tell it was erected by the Brets or the
"Piks."  Now although they ascribe some of their an-
cient buildings, such as the high church of Glasgow, to the
Picts, or Peghs, as they call them, yet it is matter of noto-
riety that the word Bret is utterly unknown to the com-

for the purpose of supporting a favourite system, and to

of Clydesdale.  Mr Pinkerton also avers that the lan-
guage of this part of Scotland still retains something of
the Welsh accent.  This is equally groundless, nor can
he point out one single instance of it; and although nu-
merous words used in the county are Gaelic, yet none
are Welsh, unless in common with the Gaelic.

this Saint was called "Kyentyren quod interpretatur
"capitalis Dominus," which is pure Gaelic at this day;
and not Welch.  His other name of Munghu "quod
"(says Josceline) Latine dicitur carus amicus," is not
Welsh but more probably Gaelic; thus Eun caomb may
have been spelt Munghu, the Gaelic pronounceation being
pretty, similar, the literal signification of which is Dear
