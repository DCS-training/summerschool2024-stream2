     NUMBER XXVII.

     PARISH OF EWES.

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF DUMFRIES, PRESBYTERY OF
     LANGHOLM.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN LAURIE.

     Situation, Extent, and Name.

   THE parish of Ewes is situated in the eastern extre-
mity of the county of Dumfries.  Its length from
N. to S. is 8 miles; and its medium breadth about 5 1/2.
The water of Ewes runs through the parish, taking its rise
in the height of the country, at the northern extremity,
and losing itself in the Esk at Langholm, 2 miles below its
southern boundary, dividing it almost into two equal parts.
In the E. part of the parish, the water of Tarras takes its
rise, and, running nearly S. W., discharges itself likewise
into the Esk, nearly 3 miles below the town of Langholm.
-I have no guess of the etymology of the name of the 
parish, unless it be taken from its being a pasture country,
and fed mostly by sheep of that description.
