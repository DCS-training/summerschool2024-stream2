nip crop is consumed by cows and young stock, while the quantity
eaten off the ground by sheep is yearly increased.
   Oat-sowing, even in favourable seasons, seldom commences un-
til about the second week of March. Barley sometimes at this
period, but generally later, occasionally not even until May.
Many consider late preferable to early sowing, in regard to weight
of crops. Reaping takes place at most uncertain periods, and not
unfrequently the harvest labours are not over before the beginning
of November.*/f The greater part of the crops is cut down by a
scythe, having two handles, which is considered as in every respect
superior to that formerly in use. But the sickle is not altogether
discontinued.
   Farm-Buildings.-- These were generally, in former times, of a
very poor description. Year after year, however, new steadings
have been erected, well adapted to the respective possessions, both
as to family accommodation, and out-buildings. The number of
thrashing-mills is continually increasing, the greater number hav-
ing horse-power, many water, and one steam.
	Leases, Rent.-- Leases, almost universally, endure for nineteen
years. There are farms of considerable extent,--one of 80 acres
imperial, the rent of which is L.39 4s. per acre; and three of 200,
130, and 120, L.2, 5s.; several L.1, 10s. to L.2; and from that sum
every rate down to 5s. All of there rents are considered, taken in
comparison with other districts of the country, high; and few of
the tenantry pay them without the exercise of their own personal
labour, while they live in a very plain and frugal manner.

<FOOTNOTE>For a considerable period the seasons have, on the whole, been favourable. A
short notice may be given respecting some of those during the latter period of the
last century, as experienced in this district. The years 1770 and 1771 were very
bad. In each, continued snow for thirteen weeks after Christmas. 1772 and 1773,
better, but grain scanty and dear. 1774, much damage from sea blight, the best oats
on the coast not producing above 7 pecks of meal per boll. 1775, oats, with fodder,
sold at L.2 per boll. 1776, very abundant. From 1777 to 1781, good. In 1779,
the seed was all sown in February, and the harvest finished in the middle of August;
oats with fodder sold at from L.1, 10s. to L.2 per boll, while meal did not exceed
13s. 4d. 1782, disastrous beyond all precedent. 1783, loss from the badness of the
seed. 1784, very abundant. 1795, bad crop and harvest,--blasting, shaking, and
rotting. 1799, oats sowing began 15th April, barley sowing, 15th May. Not two
dry consecutive days from the beginning to the end. With the exception of 1782,
the worst crop ever remembered. The Kincardineshire fiar prices of that crop were,
barley, L.2, 7s., meal, L.2, 3s. per boll. With regard to the precent century, it may
only be noticed, that the crop of 1815 was, perhaps, the greatest ever known in Bri-
tain. At the Martinmas Stonehaven market, the prices were, oats, 8s. to 9s. per
boll; meal, 10s. 6d., barley, 10s. to 12s. Barley, for which at the time he was of-
fered 11s., a tenant on the estate of Ury, (who, no doubt, often, greatly to his loss,
was accustomed long to retain his grain when prices were unsatisfactory), afterwards
sold at L.1. 10s. to L.2, and the remainder, in autumn 1817, bringing him nearly
L.500 at L.3, 3s per boll.
