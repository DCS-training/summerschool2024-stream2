   Produce and Cattle.-Oats, barley, rye, potatoes, flax, and
some wheat, are produced in the parish.  The oats and po-
tatoes are generally consumed at home, and the barley is ex-
ported from Annan, either to Liverpool or Lancaster, or to
some of the manufacturing towns near Glasgow.  The wheat
is sold to the bakers in Dumfries.  The average price of oats
is 2 s.-of barley, 2 s. 6 d.-of rye, 5 s.-and of wheat, 5 s. 6 d.
the Winchester bushel.  The farmers, and even the cottagers,
feed twine for the market, which weigh from 10 to 20, or 22
stone each, 14 lib. to the stone.  They are sold for the Eng-
lish market, from 3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. a stone.  The inhabitants
likewise rear a considerable number of young cattle, which
they generally sell when a year old; and there is hardly a
farmer who does not rear a foal annually, which at a year old
generally sells at from 8 L. to 12 L.

   Wild Animals.-There are plenty of partridges and some
muir-fowl in the parish.  The swallow, cuckoo, wheat-ear,
and woodcock, are the only birds of passage.  The king's-
fisher frequently appears on the banks of the rivers.  The sea-
gull from the Solway Frith, 6 miles distant, is the forerunner
of excessive rains or high winds.  There are also plenty of
hares, and several foxes, in the parish.

   Roads, Fuel, etc.-The great turnpike road from Car-
lisle to Glasgow runs through the E. end of the parish, by the
bridge over the river Milk.  The conversion of the statute
labour into money, has contributed greatly to the improve-
ment of the roads in the neighbouring parishes; and it is
hoped, that this practice will soon be more effectually intro-
duced into this. The want of a bridge over the river Annan,
