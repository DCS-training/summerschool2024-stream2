most useful manures, lime and dung; both of which are to
be got in the town and neighbourhood of Berwick, which is
only 4 miles distant.  These local advantages have not been
unattended to, by those persons who occupy the lands.  Great
quantities of line are annually bought, and are employed
both in improving the waste lands, and in manuring those
that are already improved.  And even dung is now begin-
ning to be brought in considerable quantities from Berwick,
a practice which, if persevered in, must in time greatly add
to the fertility of the soil; and, notwithstanding the expence,
with which the purchasing and driving of it is attended, will,
without doubt, ultimately turn out to the advantage both of
the proprietors and tenants.

management than to the manuring of the lands.  Unfetter-
ed by those prejudices, and that obstinate attachment to an-
cient customs, which are so great a bar to cultivation, and
have so much retarded the progress of agriculture in other
parts of Scotland, a spirit of improvement as well as of indus-
try is discernible among the farmers in this and the neigh-
bouring parishes:  In consequence of which, every species
both of white and green crops are raised, and, in general, in
the greatest perfection; particularly barley, oats, pease, tur-
nips, and artificial grasses.  Though the soil is, in many pla-
ces, suitable for wheat and beans, yet they are raised in smal-
ler quantities than the other kinds of grain; probably be-
cause the former does not so readily fall in with a rotation,
in which green crops are chiefly studied, and because there
is not, in this part of the country, a ready market for the lat-
ser.  Potatoes are raised not only for home consumption, but
great quantities from this neighbourhood are also annually
