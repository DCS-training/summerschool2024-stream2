became bankrupt.  For twenty years and upwards, we have
had at least two wholesale merchants, who import wood, iron,
flax, tar, and other foreign goods.  There is one good inn,
and too many alehouses.

   Manufactures.-We have no manufactory here; nor is
there any in the whole county, except two paper-mills, one
near Dunse, and the other near Ayton.

   Fishing.-There are only six fishing crews in this place,
who take abundance of fishes, the greater part of which are

and of a good quality.  We have also a herring fishery;
and, in some years, millions are caught; and, after serving
the country demand, the rest are partly salted, and made into
what are called white herrings, and partly manufactured into
red herrings, and both are sent to London, and foreign
parts, where they generally bring a good profit.  Formerly
they caught the herrings at what they called the Ground
Drove, which lasts only a few days; but now they also fish
for them by a Float Drove, which last for some months; so
that they now get ten times the number they got formerly,
and the herrings are of a far better quality, because they ne-

   Fuel.-There is no other fuel than coal.  If we were not
almost prohibited from supplying ourselves with Scottich coals,
with one of the most unreasonable duties that ever was im-

We complain of another grievance.  This port is a branch
of the Customhouse of Dunbar, and our merchants are obli-
ged to go there, which is a distance of 20 miles, to report e-
