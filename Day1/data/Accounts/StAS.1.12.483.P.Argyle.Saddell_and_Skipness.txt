     Of Saddel and Skipness.

del, Carradell, and Skipness, every species of improvement
has been carried on to a high degree of melioration.  From
the mansion-houses, the eye is entertained with an extensive
prospect of regular enclosures, sheets of verdant pasture, na-
tural woods and clumps of planted trees, with all the variety of
crops, which systematical cultivation, carried on with a libe-
ral hand and persevering attention, may be supported to pro-
duce, in a soil naturally adapted for such valubale productions.
But with these, and a few other exceptions, the rest of the
arable land in the parish, is in the same state of non-improve-
ment with every country under similar disadvantages.  The
chief obstructions to improvement in agriculture, hitherto,
have been the want of manure, and fuel; or, at least, the too
high expense of money and time necessary or procuring them.
There is no kind of manure in this parish, except dung and
sea-weed, no limestone nor marl being yet discovered in it;
and the inhabitants have been long subjected to many incon-
veniencies as to their fuel.  Turf of peats were their only
fuel: they are found in the hills; but the cutting, with the
whole expensive process of drying and carrying them home,
used to occupy the farmer and his whole family for a great
part of the summer season;  and in a wet season, he ran the
dreadful risk of wanting fire to dress his victuals, or warm
him during the inclemency of winter.  This was the de-
plorable situation of the people here, and over all the High-
lands, two years ago, and is in a great measure so, even this
season (1793).  It is very evident, that neither agriculture 
(that surest and most permanent source of national wealth),
nor any manufactures, can ever be carried on to any purpose,
in a country without manure and without fuel*.
