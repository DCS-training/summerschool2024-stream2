     Statistical Account

inhabitants may now amount to 3450, of which number,
there are 500 Protestants, and the remaining 2950 Roman
Catholics.  The great cause of the decrease of population
in the parish, is owing principally to the vast numbers that
have emigrated of late years to the island of St John's,
Nova Scotia, and Canada.  Emigration from the parish
commenced in 1772; and again, no less than 400 stout
young fellows since that period, have gone as recruits to
the army and navy from the parish.  The inhabitants are
industrious, and a very hardly set of mankind, able to un-
dergo great fatigue; they are particularly attached to the
Royal Family, and the Established Constitution.

   Stipend, Heritors, Poor.-The value of the living in the
parish, including the glebe, is about L. 50 Sterling.  It is
a royal patronage.  The heritors are, John Macdonald of
Clanranald, Esq; and Colin Macdonald of Boisdale, Esq;
The manse is in ruins, and quite uninhabitable; the incum-
bent dwells in a farm-house in the middle of the parish.
   In a district of the parish, called Benbecula, a millionary
resides, with L. 30 of a salary, paid by the trustees for 
managing the royal bounty.  There has been no church
built in the parish since the time of the Reformation.
The Protestants assemble in two school-houses, which are
now in good order and repair, and the Roman Catholics
have three mass-houses in the parish.  As to the state of
the poor of the parish, there is only a fund of L. 10 Ster-
ling yearly, which was mortified by Alexander Macdo-
nald of Boisdale, Esq; lately deceased; the fund is distri-
buted impartially by his son Colin Macdonald, Esq; with
additional donations of his own.  The people of both per-
suations, in general, are attentive and generous to the poor,
in supplying them with meal, according to their abilities,
in seasons of scarcity.
