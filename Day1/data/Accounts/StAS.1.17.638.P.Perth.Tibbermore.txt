tages to the manufacturer in other departments; and accor-
dingly a bleachfield, under the firm of Richardson and Co.
whose buildings and machinery were erected here in the year
1775, has become a very large and important concern.  The
brown cloth to be bleached is brought chiefly from Perth,
Dundee, Dunfermline, Edinburgh, and Glasgow; but such,
is the increasing character of the field, and the high reputa-
tion of the acting partner of the company, that, for some
years past, a considerable quantity of diapers in particular,
have been regularly sent to him from Darlington in England.
About 70 Scotch acres are commonly covered with cloth,
and the work employs or maintains about 100 men, women,
and children.  There are also some other fields in this pa-
rish, employed, as bleaching ground, in connection with a
work whose buildings and machinery are in the parish of
Perth*.  And it ought not, perhaps, here, to remain unob-
served, that at present the quantity of cloth bleached in the
neighbourhood of Perth, far exceeds the quantity that is
woven or otherwise manufactured in the town and district
around.  This would lead us to presume, either that there
must be something in the situation peculiarly favourable to
the operation of bleaching, or that nothing is wanted but
equal enterprise in the other departments: And that the last
supposition may be the just one, is rendered probable, by the
uncommon success of some late attempts, of which a remark-
able example naturally presents itself in the case of a print-
field, under the firm of Young, Ross, Richardson, and Caw+,
which was established in this parish upon the same canal, to
lately as the year 1792, and has already become an object
of such importance; as to be entitled to a distinguished place
