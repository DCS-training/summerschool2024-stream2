   Market-Town.--The only market-town in the parish is the
town of Blairgowrie, which was erected into a barony in favour of
George Drummond of Blair, the then proprietor of the estate of
Blairgowrie, by a Royal charter from Charles I., dated 9th July
1634. In the year 1809, the town was created a free burgh of
barony by a charter from Colonel M'Pherson, the feudal supe-
rior, whereby the burgesses were empowered to elect a bailie and
four councillors for the management of the affairs of the burgh.
The bailie and two of the councillors vacate their offices every
two years, and their places are supplied by others elected by the
burgesses qualified to vote in terms of the charter.
   The population of the town in 1841, the period when the last
census was taken, was 2242. Since the publication of the last
Statistical Account, its population has  been quadrupled, as will
appear from the following table:

   The police of the town is regulated by the provisions of
the General Police Act, and is under the management of the
chief magistrate and four commissioners, the latter being elected
annually by the L.10 householders. These commissioners have
the power of levying, for the purposes of the act, an assessment
to the extent of 8d. per pound on rents at and above L.2; and
the funds thus raised are applied under the management of these
commissioners, to defray the expenses of lighting and cleaning
the streets of the town, and other necessary charges connected
with the police of the place. The provisions of the Act regarding
watching, and paving have not been adopted, the householders
being bound by the charter of constitution, either themselves to
take their turn of watching, or to provide substitutes. This is
not a very burdensome duty, as it only devolves about once a-year
on each inhabitant.
   The town is now well lighted with gas, supplied by a joint-stock
company established in l894, and gas is now very generally sub-
stituted for oil and candles, both in the shops and private dwel-
