   Manners.-There is no difference in manners and habits
between the cottager and the master of the farm.  The mas-
ter often turns to cottager, and the cottager sometimes be-
comes the master.  They all take social snuff together.  Their
houses and their furniture are exactly the same.  They all,
without distinction, sit at the oar in their boats; and at land
they all jointly perform the same labour and work.  Youth
and old age constitute the only distinction of rank.  The old
often are so reduced, that they betake themselves to going
from house to house for sustenance; and then they are well
received; and it is not accounted beggary when they do so.
