and rustic gallantry, than from a settled malevolence of dis-
position.  The more improved manners, and a more general
intercourse with society, have, in a great measure, done away
this turbulent disposition; still the natives of Campsie may be
considered as a keen tempered people, by no means averse to
expose themselves to bodily danger at any time: the young
people have no objection to a military life, being fond of no-
velty and adventure; during the present war, no less than 28
have enlisted in the land service, and seven have entered on
board the navy; these remarks chiefly apply to the lower class
of people.  The gentry, for at least these 40 years, have been
remarkable for their sobriety, decent behaviour, and ocono-
mical habits; of course, they are all in prosperous circum-
stances; rigid oconomy was not the virtue of their forefa-
thers*.

the manufacturing part of the community, as more regular than they were e-
ven five years ago.
The people of Campsie cannot be said to be of a litigious disposition:  It is
true, from their apparent keenness, you would be apt to imagine that they
should be constantly engaged in lawsuits.-The reverse is the case: The high-
er born and better informed class of people, studiously avoid litigation.  A-
mongst the other description of the inhabitants, much threatening, and a few
hasty words, generally terminate the dispute.  Neither writer nor messenger
at arms reside in the parish; at the same time, considering the number of the
transactions which must inevitably take place in a rich and populous district,
(even though no law-suit intervenes) a great deal of business is afforded to
both professions.  Although I could not take upon me to say that the inhabi-
