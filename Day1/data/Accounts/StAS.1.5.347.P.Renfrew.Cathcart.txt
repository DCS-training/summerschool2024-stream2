   Plants and Woods.-The banks of the Cart, have long
been resorted to, by the botanical student.  Such is the
warmth and shelter, in some of these sequestrated spots,
that almost a perpetual verdure is to be found.  Here, spe-
cimens of most of those plants, which the clearing the
grounds of the woods, with which they were originally co-
vered, have banished from the country, still shoot up in
their native luxuriancy and vigour.  Of these, we could
easily produce a catalogue, but we are conscious that there
are none, but what are sufficiently known to the lovers of
botany, and to others, their bare names will afford but li-
tle entertainment.  It is much to be regretted, that such
indiscriminate havock, should have been made of the origi-
nal plantations of the country.  By the war, which, for
ages past, has been waged against the forests of Scotland,
they are now indeed reduced within very narrow limits;
and the small remnants, which have been fortunately left,
in glens and on the steep banks of rivers, more from negli-
gence than design, are dwindling fast away.  Hence we
will not only be deprived of many of those beauties,
which nature, in its rude forms, presents to the view of e-
very person of taste and discernment; but also many of
those humble plants, which grew up under their shelter,
will only be known by their names.  The boar, the wolf,
and even the deer, to whom these woods proved a defence,
are now no more to be found in this country; and it is to
be feared, that their more harmless vegetable inhabitants,
will also share the same fate.  The complaint of a late ce-
lebrated scholar and moralist, although no favourite of the
inhabitants of this country, is but too well founded, when
he reflects upon the scarcity of trees in Scotland.  They
