Aborigines of this district, than in the more eligible country
in which, after quitting this parish, they establish their set-

some of them have been executed, they have a tendency to
divert the eye from the native deformity of the surface.
This emboldens us to say, that if heritors in general were
more liberal in their encouragement to the tenantry, and
were they relieved from those setters which their ancestors
had imposed upon them, frequently beyond their abilities, 
that we would soon observe and exuberance of produce, and
