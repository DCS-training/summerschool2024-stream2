The moor and waste ground might be improved by letting
it, free of rent, for a certain number of years.  This in-
ducement would do more than counterbalance every ob-
stacle; for the most of it is dry, free of stones, of a sandy
bottom, and the means of improvement at hand.  Encou-
ragement for inclosing, especially where the leases are short,
would be beneficial.  The multures exacted at mills are
considered as a grievance, and some of the heritors are con-
verting them into money.  The distance from any sea-
port, or market place, is another disadvantage.  This, how-
ever, might in a great measure be removed, by leading a
canal from Peterhead to the neighbouring parish of Deer,
which, by most people, is thought not impracticable.  If a
fund sufficient for this purpose could not be raised by contri-
bution in the neighbourhood, application might be made to
Government for some assistance, which is seldom made in-
vain, when public utility is the petitioner.
