     Statistical Account

that the Court of Mantua ordered 'a general mourning for
him; and this circumstance alone, independent of every o-
ther panegyric, throws an indelible lustre on his memory.
Among the many epitaphs that lamented his death, it may
not be improper, in a repository of this kind, to insert the
following one by Johnson in his inscriptions on Scottish he-
roes:

     JACOBUS CRITONIUS CLUNIUS*

   Musarum pariter ac Martis alumnus, omnibus in studiis,
ipsis etiam Italis admirabilis, Mantu‘ a ducis Mantuani fi-
lio nocturnis infidiis occisus est anno Christi 1581.
     Et genus et censum dat Scotia; Gallia pectus
     Excolit: Admirans Itala terra virum
     Ambit, et esse suum vellet: Gens ‘mula vitam
     Abstulit; an satis hoc dicat ut illa suum?
     Mantua habet cineres, scelus execrata nefandum;
     At tumuli tanto gaudet honori tamen.

*For the sake of those who seem to be of opinion that the wonderful
Crichton was not a cadet of the Clunie family of that name, but of the
family of Elliock, we here beg leave to quote the following intelligence,
collected from the chartulary of the Earl of Airly, and obligingly com-
municated to us by Mr Thomas Mitchell at Craig, present factor on the
Airly estate: "The loch island, and chapel of St Catharine, within the
loch, together with other parts of the barony of Clunie, and teinds of the
whole, anciently belonged to the Bishop of Dunkeld, the rest of the ba-
rony to the Herons of Glasclune.  About the commencement of the Re-
formation, that part which pertained to Heron was apprised from him by
Robert (afterwalds Sir Robert) Crichton of Elliock, King's Advocate of
Scotland; and at the same time George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld,
who was a brother of Sir Robert's, disponed to him his whole property
in the barony, with this remarkable reservation, that it should be in the
Bishop's power, at any time he pleased, to resume it, and incumbent on
the disponee to yield it, ahd all title thereto, and to remove therefrom,
