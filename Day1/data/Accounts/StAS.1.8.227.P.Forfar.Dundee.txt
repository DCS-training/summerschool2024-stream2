surer is alone unlimited.  When two persons have thus
been leeted, for every one of these seven offices, the pow-
ers of two particular old counsellors, as to any farther

counsellors is reduced to 26.  The leets are then transmitted
to the convener of the 9 incorporated trades, to be by him

should take place among the counsellors, and at the same tune
the deacons remain united, this controul must be of very lit-

of intelligence and public spirit, than falls to the common lot
of humanity, such a society must be under strong induce-

munity; anti having different interests, it will certainly be
suspected of entertaining such persuasions, and its conduct, e-
