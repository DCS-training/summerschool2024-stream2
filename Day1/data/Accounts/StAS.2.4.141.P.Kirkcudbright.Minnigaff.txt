beauty of situation, it is surpassed by none in the south of Scot-
land. The glebe extends to twenty acres, and is worth L. 25

ton and Creetown; Reformed Presbyterian, 43, do. in Newton-
Stewart; Relief, 26, do. do.; Episcopalians, 8; Baptists, 2; Ro-

	In 1702, Anthony Stewart, in Larg, bequeathed the sum of
L. 50 Scots for behoof of the poor; and some years subsequently,
Archibald Stewart, in Larg, mortified 500 merks to provide an
assistant to the minister. The records funish no information how
the money was expended. In 1811, Lady Elizabeth Heron left
L.21 Sterling to the poor. The other benefactions are L. 100 in the
3 per cent. consols, bequeathed by--Dunbar, Esq. the inte-
rest of which is to be expended on the poor; and L. 100, less legacy
duty, left by--M'Taggart, Esq. As the minutes of session
contain no notice of either of these two donations, the writer is
unable to furnish any particulars beyond the surname of the do-
nors. Previous to 1827, Nicholas Simpson bequeathed to the
session, for behoof of the poor, a house in Millcroft, worth L. 5
yearly.
	The only Society for religious purposes connected with the pa-
rish is the Newton-Stewart and Minnigaff Missionary Association,
instituted in 1839, the income of which has averaged L. 14 annu-
ally. A Bible Society was formed by the kirk-session in June
1839; 28 copies of the Bible have been distributed gratis, and
50 sold at a low price; 21 Testaments have been given gratis, and
28 sold; making 127 copies of the Scriptures circulated.

teacher's salary is L. 34, 4s. The school fees average L. 28, 4s.;
