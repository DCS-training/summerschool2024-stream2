ship paid the balance, which was a great and seasonable relief
to the industrious poor at that time.

   Castle.-The old castle of Douglas was burnt by accident
about 33 years ago.  The Duke, in his lifetime, built one
wing of a new castle, of very strong and elegant work, in
which there are betwixt 50 and 60 fire-rooms.  This wing
was finished by Lord Douglas, but it still wants a front and
another wing to complete the plan.  The dining room is a
most elegant one, being 40 1/2 feet long, 25 feet broad, and 18
feet high.  There is also a beautiful hanging stair, which is
much admired by all people of taste.

   General Character of the People.-They are a sober, decent,
and industrious set of people; attend regularly on the ordi-
nances of the gospel, and are remarkably charitable and
humane; they even turn their innocent amusements to the
advantage of the poor; for, during the severe frost last winters
when they went to curling on the ice, a favourite diversion
here, they, more than once, played for a certain sum each,
and applied the forfeited money, to purchase coals for the
poor.
