   Dress.-Since the year 1745, there is a considerable change
on the dress of the people of this district.  By a singular kind
of policy, as if rebellion lurked in the shape and colour of a
coat, at the above period, the ancient dress was proscribed
and none durst wear it without running the risk of a rigor-
ous prosecution.  It was consequently superseded by the Low
Country dress.  To the ancient braccae, or truish* and belted
plaid, succeeded strait breeches, and an awkward coat of a
uniform colour; sometimes a long surtout dangling down to
the heels, encumbering the freedom of motion.  The barbar-
ous policy of Edward the First, did not more effectually de-
stroy the spirit of the indignant Welsh, by the murder of
their bards, than the prohibition of their ancient garb, that
of the poor Highlanders.  In the enthusiasm of patriotism,
Mr Fraser of Lovat got the prohibitory act repealed, in or-
der, according to his own emphatic words, "to divert the
minds of the people from Transatlantic notions."  Let meta-
physicians, if they choose, trace the connexion.  But, though
this respectable gentleman, with the view of making them
good subjects, procured liberty to the Highlanders of exposing
their naked posteriors to the north wind, on their bleak
mountains, few have availed themselves of the privilege.
Habit reconciles them to the present, and they seem to have
no desire of resuming their ancient garb.  The blue bonnet,
however, with the exception of some round hats, still main-
tains its ground.  Since the year 1745, the women too, like
the men, have altered considerably in their apparel.  Before
that period, they wore sometimes white blankets covering
