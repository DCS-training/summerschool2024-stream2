			AUCHTERHOUSE.                  651

	   Good Sir John Ramsay, and the Ruthven true,
	   Barclay and Bisset, with men not a few,
	   Do Wallace meet,--all canty, keen, and erouse,
            And with three hundred march to Ochterhouse.
         At no great distance from the House of Auchterhouse, and in
other parts of the parish, some of those subterraneous abodes,
called weems, have been found, one of which contained the stones
of a hand-mill and some bones, and a brass ring, and another the
bones of some animal, and a parcel of the ashes of burned wood;
and near the bottom of the south declivity of the Hill of Sidla,
stands a Druidical altar in a very entire state. On a farm in the
south-east district of the parish, several traces of a battle have
been recently discovered. In one place, the spade and mattock
were opposed by a strong plate of vitrified stones. The stones
were of the same kind with those on the surface of the contiguous
corn-field. The plate was of a circular figure, of four yards dia-
meter, and on it lay a bed two inches thick, of nearly decomposed
human bones, covered by a surface of the ashes of burned wood;
and, in other places, stone-coffins, containing htm`n bones, have
been disinterred in the prosecution of agricultural improvements.
May we suppose that these human bones and ashes of human
bones are part of the sad remains of the last sanguinary struggle
betwixt the Scottish and Pictish nations for the ascendency in
Scotland, which commenced at Restenet, and closed at Pitalpie?
