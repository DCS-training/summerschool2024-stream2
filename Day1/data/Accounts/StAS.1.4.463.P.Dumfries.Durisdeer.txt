of them have been very successful in the West Indies.  The
people, in general, live comfortably.  Some of the princi-
pal farmers and storemasters are in affluent circumstances,
and live in a genteel manner.-The rent of cot-houses is
from 10 s. to 20 s. a-year.  farmers, tradesmen, labourers and
servants, are much better lodged than 20 or 30 years ago.
The removal of the burden of hay and corn labour, coal car-
riage, the payment of fowls and other servitudes, would me-
liorate the condition of some of the farmers.  A moderate
advance of yearly rent, instead of high grassums, (which
take away the money that would enable the farmers to
improve their ground), would have the same effect.  Were
the tax on horses taken off, it would tend to meliorate, in 
some degree, the condition of the clergy.  They must con-
sider themselves aggrieved in being subjected to pay a tax for
horses only employed in labouring their glebes, and in car-
rying them to discharge the offices of their profession.  They
plead an exemption, because the law allows them a horse in
landward parishes; because glebes, by act of parliament, be-
fore the Union, were from taxation, and because every
privilege belonging to the Church of Scotland before the U-
nion, was expressly stipulated to be continued.-There are
9 houses, where whisky, porter, and ale are fold by licence.
The morals of the people will. probably, be hurt by drink-
ing more spiritious liquors since the malt-duty was raised so

ferent.  The statue-labour is commuted.  A road from the
village of Durisdeer would connect the Wallpath road with the
new turnpike to Sanquhar and the west country, and would
be of very great service to all the inhabitants of Carron water
for the article of coals.  A bridge over Nith, even though it
were constructed of timer, would be of material advantage;
