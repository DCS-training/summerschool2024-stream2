     of Ruthwell.

minates in the parish of Tinwald, a few miles to the north-
ward, separating the two vallies of Nith and Annan.

   Soil, Climate, etc.-The soil, though in some places shal-
low and inclined to sand, is, in general, when properly ma-
nured and managed, sufficiently fertile; and, as the exposure
is good, the crops are early, a singular advantage in this part
of the country.  Situated upon the sea, the air is of course
moist, but by no means unhealthy.  Many persons from dif-
ferent parts of the country repair here in summer for the be-
nefit of bathing, and sea air.  The sea has rather receded
from the Scotch side of the Frith of late years, and the tides
do not rise to the same height they did formerly, so that the
land has gained considerably, and large tracks of green merse
now appear, where the tides flowed over a surface of land.
It was, some time ago, in the contemplation of Lord Stor-
mont, the proprietor of these lands, to attempt an embank-
ment for recovering a considerable track of these flat sands,
and preventing their being inundated, as is done in Holland,
but the violence of the tides discouraged the undertaking,
and nature is herself now performing what art was to have
accomplished; the green ground or merse extending almost
a mile further than it did some years ago.  At the mouth
of the Lochay there is a small port, where barks and little
coasting vessels load and deliver coals and grain.

   Population.-The parish is the property of four heritors,
(but much the greatest part of it belongs to the Viscount of
Stormont,) of these only two are resident.  The number of
fouls is 1061, whereof 519 are males, and 542 females.  The
inhabitants have increased within this last twenty years in
he proportion of five to three, which may be ascribed first
to the division of large farms into smaller possessions, and
