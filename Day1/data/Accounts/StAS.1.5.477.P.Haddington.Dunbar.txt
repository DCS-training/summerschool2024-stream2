Thirlage to a mill, and all kinds of feudal servitude to the
landlord, are extremely inconvenient to the farmer, and ho-
stile to all improvements.  Indeed, these Gothic customs
are justly falling into disuse among the sensible part of the
gentlemen in Scotland.

   Population.-By an accurate survey, in the present year,
(1792), it appears, that there are 3700 inhabitants in the
parish, of all ages.  The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, a-
mounting only to 3281, there is consequently an increase of
419 souls.  The following is an abstract from the session re-
gister, of births, marriages, and burials for the last 10 years :

   This account is pretty accurate, in respect of marriages
and burials, but is considerably deficient in regard to births,
as many neglect to get the names of their children entered
in the public register.  If any regulation could be made to
supply this defect, and to enable the session-clerk to keep
the parish register exact, and to oblige him to give in annu-
ally to some public office, a true list, signed also by the mi-
nister, of all the births, marriages, and burials, which have
happened in the parish for that year ; it would ascertain
the population of every particular parish, as well as of
Scotland in general; and might answer many valuable na-
tional purposes.
