There is nothing impracticable in the undertaking, if
the publick will lend the suitable aid.  An experienced
architect, Mr. Stevens, who built the bridge at Dublin,
and is now building that at Montrose, surveyed the ri-
ver at that place 2 years ago, and found the work per-
fectly practicable, and that the rock, at the W. side of
the river, run across the whole way, at a moderate
depth below the bed of the river.  The breadth of the
river at that place is about 98 yards.  This he proposed
to cover with 3 arches.  The expense he estimated at
14,000 L. at the highest.  No such sum as this, even for
an object of the greatest utility, can be expected to be
raised in the country, either by subscription, or by a
toll, or by both.  This could only be expected in the
neighbourhood of a great town.  It is only by the ef-
fectual aid of government, that a work of such magni-
tude can be undertaken in the country, and especially
in such a distant part of the country as this.  And to
that effectual support, this work appears to have the
justest claim, not only from its great utility to so consi-
derable a part of the kingdom as above mentioned, but
likewise for reasons in which government is more im-
mediately concerned.  At present, a flood in Spey may
very materially affect the administration of justice, by
stopping the judges in going on the circuit to Inverness,
or in returning from thence to Aberdeen: Or the troops
may, by the same cause, be retarded in their march to
or from Fort George, or the other forts in the North,
or from the country on the one side of the Spey to the
other; and cases may occur, in which this may be of
very bad consequence to the peace of the country, to
the protection of the subjects, and to other purposes of
