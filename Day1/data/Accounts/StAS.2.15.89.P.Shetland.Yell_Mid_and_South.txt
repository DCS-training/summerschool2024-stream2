tivated; and the remaining 33-000 acres are in pasture, to which
the tenants renting the amble and enclosed lands have a common
right of pasture effeiring to their respective rents. Perhaps the
half of the enclosed grass grounds might be profitably cultivated
with a view to improving them as pasture; while almost the whole
of the unenclosed common might be rendered more valuable by, a
regular system of surface draining, which, wherever attempted,
has had the effect of ameliorating both the soil and grass. But a
want of capital is the great bar to improvements of this or any
other description ; and, with the exception of what has been dorie
by Mr Bruce of Burravoe, and by Mr Ogilvy of Quarff, little has
this remote district been benefited by the modern discoveries in
agriculture.
   No attention has hitherto been paid to the selection of proper
breeding, stock, either from the native black-cattle, sheep, or
horses. This is the more to be regretted, because the native are
the animals best adapted to the climate and food, and because no
other description of cattle bred in Shetland will ever be so much
sought after for the south country market. No animal, in propor-
tion to its size of bone, has ever been known to carry a greater
weight of fat; and compared with it, our present mongrel breeds
are an ugly gaunt-looking race, utterly unfit for Shetland keep,
and assuredly never to be sought after by those who know the
points which characterize a good animal.
