   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 2009.  The population of Crawford amounts
at present to about 520 persons, exclusive of Leadhills,

1490.  The baptisms of children belonging to parents of
the Established Church are commonly from 12 to 14 an-

ceives from L. 6 to L. 8 yearly; beasides these who live
in the master's house, and have victuals there, there are
herds who commonly live in a separate house.  They
are allowed grass for a cerain number of sheep and cows,
and a certain quantity of meal for board, which in all a-
mounts from L. 10 to L 12 a-year.  Every shepherd is
attended by his dog; he stands in the valley, and sends
the dog up the hill to the sheep.  When the animal hath
executed in part the commission with which he was sent
out, he turns, looks at his master, and waits for further
