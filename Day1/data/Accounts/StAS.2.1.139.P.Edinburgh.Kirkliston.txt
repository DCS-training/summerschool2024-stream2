<TABLE=POPULATION>

                              III.-POPULATION.

   There are no means of determining what may have been the
ancient state of the parish in regard to population.
         By return made to Dr Webster in   1755, the population was 1461
         By former Statistical Account in  1792,                    1504
         By Parliamentary census taken in  1801,                    1647
                                           1811,                    1682
                                           1821,                    2216
                                           1831,                    2265

   The great increase of population since 1811 is supposed to have
been owing to the extraordinary numbet of labourers, cheifly Irish-
men, who were empolyed in the parish in the years 1818, 1819,
1820, and 1821, in the construction of the Union Canal, many of
whom became, from that time, settle inhabitants.
   Number of inhabitants residing in villages in the country:-
Kirkliston village, 600: Winchburgh, 165: Newbridge, 90;
Gogar Stane: in the country, 1235; total 2265.
   The average of births cannot be exactly ascertained, as the duty
of inserting the names of their children in the parish register has
been for many years greatly neglected by parents; in this respect,
however, a decided improvement of the number of children baptized
in the Established Church, in public and private, during the seven
years beginning 1931:-
