the Reformation, the temporalities of the subdeanry of Glas-
gow, which consisted of the parishes of Cadder and Monkland,
(the last of which was afterwards split into two parishes, call-
ed Old and New Monkland), together with the patronage of
the churches, came into the possession of the noble families of
Hamilton and Kilmarnock, and were by them transferred to
the College of Glasgow, for a considerable sum of money,
about the year 1656.-The parish of Cadder, as well as that
of Monkland, availing itself of the act of Parliament 1690, by
paying 600 merks Scotch, as directed in the act, to the College
of Glasgow, obtained a renunciation of the right of patronage
by that learned body; in consequence of which, the heritors
and elders of the parish became the electors of the minister.
It is a pity, however, that the act 1690 has not defined pre-
cisely what constitutes an heritor; for this defect has been at-
tended with great inconveniences to the parish of Cadder.
When the church of Cadder was formerly vacant, about the
year 1745, there were keen disputes as to the title of several
persons claiming a right to vote under the character of heri-
tors; in consequence of which, the kirk was vacant for near
two years.  And though the late worthy clergyman, who suc-
ceeded on the occasion, died in June 1790, the church still con-
tinues vacant, owing to a warm dispute, with respect to the
title of a number, who voted at a late election of a minister, and
which is at present under litigation before the Court of Session.
It ought however to be mentioned, that the College of Glas-
gow, who are still titulars of the tiends, upon application be-
ing made to them, generously consented, much to their honour,
as well as to the benefit of this parish, to allow part of the va-
cant stipend to be laid out, in paying the expence of a preacher,
to officiate at Cadder church during the vacancy, under the
direction of the presbytery of Glasgow.-The living is 8 chal-
