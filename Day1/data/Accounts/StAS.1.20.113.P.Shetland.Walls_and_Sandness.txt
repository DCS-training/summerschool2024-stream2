as it is somewhat under water.  Unacquainted with the me-
chanic arts, it is surprising how the ancient people convey-
ed together, and erected, such large stones as compose these
rude fabrics.  As these buildings are not all similar, either
in bulk or shape, it is probable they were used either as
sorts or places of strength; places of observation, or watch-
towers; or places of worship.  When large, having a double
or triple wall around, as is the case of some such buildings,
they may be denominated fortresses, or places of residence,
whither the inhabitants retired for shelter in times of danger.
When these Pictish erections were meant as watch-towers,
they were smaller in size, were only single walled, and were
placed on eminences, from which signals might be displayed,
and seen, when an invasion threatened the inhabitants.  Such
are always in the view of some other one.  Others, that are
small in bulk, and yet so situated as not to be seen by any
other, were probably places where superstitious rites were
performed.  There is the vestige of one of there latter build-
ings, that stands on a piece of ground jutting into a sheet
of water that lies contiguous to the manse.  It is surround-
ed with the water, except in front, and has a small cause-
way leading to it.  Beside the circular building in the mid-
dle, there is a range of large stones, that runs across the neck
of land, and may have been intended to inclose the spot, as a
place of burial, which the building does not occupy.-There
is a stone, very long, that lay time immemorial in the church-
yard of Papa, but was lately built into one of the corners of
the church, which stone has all the appearance of having been
used as an anchor to a ship, before iron anchors were used.
It is about eight feet in length, and two in diameter.  It
has a groove, continued on each side the whole length, turn-
ing narrower towards both ends, in which a rope would be
