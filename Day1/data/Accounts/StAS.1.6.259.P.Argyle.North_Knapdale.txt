there 30 years, the face and condition of this country has un-

   Extent, Soil, Climate, etc.-The extent of this parish is a-
bout 12 miles in length, and 3 in breadth, An arm of the sea
intersects it nearly into two equal parts.  It is bounded on the
west by the Atlantic ocean.  The soil, for pasture and tillage
is excellent; and of arable ground there is a very great proporti-

numbers of children used to die of the small-pox, when it
made its attack by contagion.
   Among the hills of this parish there are many small lakes
abounding in the finest trout.  Salmon is got in many places
along the coast; and the herring pay an annual visit to many
arms of the sea, though not in great numbers.
   The hill called Cruach-Lussa is the highest in the parish.
From the top of this eminence a stranger, fond of the sub-

objects in North Britain.  From it may be seen, towards
the west, as much of the Atlantic as the eye can command,
diversified with a considerable number of the Hebrides, Islay,
Jura, Scarba, Mull, Seil, and many smaller islands, fer-
tile in corn, and abounding in the finest pasture.  The
