when digged into, and appear to have been destroyed by
fire.  On the west there was a place of worship, the remains
of which still appear; also a burying ground, which the peo-
ple of Broughead use to this day.  The whole seems also to
have been surrounded on the top of the rocks with a very
thick stone wall.  From all that I can learn, this fort was
built by the Danes, as a place of safety for their arms and
other effects in times of dangers also a place of residence to
some of their families.  When, or by whom it was burnt I
cannot learn.  A fabulous story prevails among the country

place of defence.
   The bay to the west of there rocks forms the safest and

and the shipmasters say there is not a place north of Leith
that is so well calculated for a sea port.  Ships of any bur-

being defended on the north and east by the rocks; and the
bottom of the bay consists of clay and moss; and if a few
hundred pounds were well laid out, it would be the best har-
bour in Scotland; and, in the present situation of this coun-
try, it would be productive of the most advantageous effects,
both in getting coals, and all mercantile goods imported, and
