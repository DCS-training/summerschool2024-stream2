   Roads and Markets.-The roads are made and repaired
by the money-conversion of 12s. on every 100 merks, in-
stead of the statute-labour.  From Scroggs to Debate, a dis-
tance of about 5 or 6 miles, there is an excellent road.  The
market-towns to which the inhabitants of this parish usually
resort are, Lockerby, Annan, Dumfries.  The black cattle
are sold at Dumfries, and at Lockerby, but more especially

   Poor's Funds.-The poor are supported from the interest

   Minister, Benefice, School.-The present minister is the
Reverend Mr Paxton, a batchelor.  His three last prede-

victual.  There was in the year 1795 no parish-school in
