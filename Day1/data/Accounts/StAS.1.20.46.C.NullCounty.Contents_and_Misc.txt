   The following is a Copy of the Unanimous Vote of the
  General Assembly, in favour of the Statistical Account
  of Scotland.

                              "Edinburgh, 27th May 1793.

   " Which day, in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
"upon a motion made and unanimously agreed to, the Moderator,
"from the chair, recommended to such Ministers as have not yet furnished
"Sir John Sinclair, with Statistical Accounts of their respective parishes, to
"contribute, with all the expedition in their power, to complete a Work
"of such apparent public utility."

     No. III.  Circular Letter, dated the 4th of October 1793.

     SIR

   His Majesty having been graciously pleased, to place me at the head of
the Board of Agriculture, constituted for the purpose of promoting
the internal improvement of the country, (a situation which, I find, will be
attended with a great labour and fatigue), I am therefore extremely desi-
rous, of bringing the Statistical Account of Scotland, as quickly as possible,
to a conclusion; and I flatter myself, that it can easily be now completed
before Christmas.  Your exertions for that purpose, I am persuaded, will
not be wanting; and I will trouble you to inform me, in course of post,
when your return may be expected, as, without such information, the
printing of the remaining volumes cannot well be arranged.  I remain,
with much esteem, Sir, your very obedient humble servant,

     JOHN SINCLAIR.

   EDINBURGH,
   Oct. 4, 1793.

     No IV.  Circular Note, dated the 3d of November 1793.

   SIR JOHN SINCLAIR presents his compliments, with the inclosed ar-
rangement of the Agricultural Surveys, now going forward, which are
to be completed against Christmas next, although they extend all over the
kingdom.  He is perfectly astonished at not having heard from you before
this time; and he should consider it disgraceful to the Church of Scotland,
