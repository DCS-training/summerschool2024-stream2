undertaking for such a place; but it will doubtless contribute
much to the advantage of Montrose, will add to the va-
lue of lands in that neighbourhood, and, if the roads are once
put in proper order, will be an additional inducement, to
bring the mail coach, along this coast, to the north of Scot-
land, the benefit of which will be very great.

   Bason.-The bason of Montrose is a beautiful piece of
water, nearly circular, and about three miles in diameter.  At
low water, it is mostly dry, but at high water, it has a charm-
ing effect from the west side of the town, washes the garden-
walls, and tends much to the cleanliness of the place.  Ves-
sels, of 50 or 60 tons burden, come to the east and west side
of the bason, without any risk.  This is of great advantage
to the surrounding heritors, as they can bring lime and coals,
by water, very near their different estates.
   In the last century, an attempt was made to cut off a con-
siderable part of the bason, and convert it into arable land,
by running a dike from near the Fort hill, along the bank of
the river Southest, towards the estate of Dun.  The scheme
was nearly carried into execution; and, as the soil is a strong
clay, it would have been very advantageous to the proprie-
tors.  But the persons who had the management of this un-
dertaking, quarrelling among themselves, the work went on
but slowly; and when the dike was nearly completed, a
storm arose, and levelled the whole with the ground.  The
foundation of this dike is stell visible, and the scheme ap-
pears rational; but all thoughts of carrying it into execution,
even on a smaller scale, seem at present, to be abandoned.
Some houses in the town, are known to have been built of
stones, which composed a part of this dike.  It is still called
the Drainers dike.
