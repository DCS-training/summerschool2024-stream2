ing improvements rapidly around him; and there is now a
probability, that agriculture will advance apace; though, in
this part of the country, it must be confessed she is but in her

of this hill; and, on the very spot where they meet, is a ter-
minus, or mark, from which is seen the greater part of Caith-
ness, Ross, Banff, Murray, etc. the windings of the Devern,
part of Spey, the Murray Firth, the German ocean, etc. etc.
as far as the eye can reach.  In short, this hill affords one of
