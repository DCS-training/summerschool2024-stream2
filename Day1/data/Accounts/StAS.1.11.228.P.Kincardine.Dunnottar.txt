approached, and commanded on every side.  In the year 1685,
Dunnottar Castle was employed as a place of confinement
for a body of Presbyterians, to the number of 167 men and
women, who had been seized at different times in the west of
Scotland, during the persecution under Charles II.; and after
being some time prisoners in Edinburgh, were sent to Dunnot-
tar, upon the news of Argyll's invasion.  Here they were treated
with the greatest cruelty, which is particularly described in
Woodrow's History; the whole number being confined, during
the warmest season of the year, in one vault, which is still
to be seen entire, and called "the Whig's Vault."  A list of
their names is upon record, in the sheriff-court office of the
county; and a grave stone, in the church-yard of Dunnottar,
placed upon a number of them who died under confinement,
narrates the fact.  The false policy of those times requires no
comment: And it must afford satisfaction to every liberal
mind to reflect, that the principles of toleration are now fully
established; which not only secure the rights of conscience to
every individual, but also tend, in a high degree, to preserve
the peace of society, if not abused and perverted by factious
and designing men.

   For all this steady service to the Crown, attended in its consequences with
many years confinement, and much loss of property, Governor Ogilvy received
no farther mark of royal favour, or reward, but the title of Baronet, and a new
coat of arms, expressive of the action, as the motto bears," PRECLARUM REGI
"ET REGNO SERVITIUM;" while some other persons, of higher interest, claim-
ing merit on the same ground, received ample honours and emoluments.  The
whole original letters, relating to the siege of Dunnottar, and the preservation of
the regalia, are in the possession of Sir DAVID OGILVY, present proprietor of
BARRAS, in this parish.
