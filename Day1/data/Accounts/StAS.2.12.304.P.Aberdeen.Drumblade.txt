   At one time, there was evidently a chapel or religious house in
the parish besides the church.  There are now no remains of the
building; but the form of a burying-ground is still seen, now fenced
and planted, and a well called the Chapel Well.
   Land-owners.-There are altogether five heritors, viz. the Duke
of Richmond, who now inherits the Gordon property, and posses-
ses exactly half the valued rent of the parish; William Bisset, Esq.
of Lessendrum; Archibald Duff, Esq. of Drummuir, (lands of
Dummuies); John Humphrey, Esq. of Comalleggie; and John
Lawson, Esq. of Chapelton.
   Modern Buildings.-The only mansion-bouse in the parish is
that of Lessendrum, William Bisset, Esq. who is the only residing
heritor.  It is partly an old and partly a modern building, it hav-
ing recently undergone a very extensive addition and repair at the
hands of the present proprietor.
