There is no appearance of lime or building of any kind about the
cairn, nor does tradition, nor any record to which I have bad ac-
cess, tend to throw light upon what may have been the cause of its
original formation.  The common belief, in which I am disposed
to acquiesce, is that some hostile encounter had taken place in the
neighbourhood, at a period of remote antiquity.  There would
appear to have been a line of cairns in that part of the country.
In the adjoining parishes of Tarves and Methlick, the names of
many of the farms have either the prefix or affix of cairn.  Within
a distance of about ten miles there are several thus designated, as
Cainbrogie, Cairn-norrie, Conchercairn, &c. &c.

                    III.-POPULATION.
   I have not been able to ascertain much concerning the ancient
population of the parish; but within the last half century, it has
greatly increased.  By the Government census of 1831 it was 3252;
(males, 1586; females, 1666;) and there is a farther increase since
that period.  It is pretty equally spread over the country, and not
concentrated in any quarter in a town or village; the chief cause of
the increase is the reclaiming of waste land and the formation of
new settlements.  The yearly average of births for the last seven
years is 93; of marriages, within the same period, 21. *  There is no
register of deaths kept, but for the last six years a register has
been kept of burials within the parish churchyard, the yearly ave-
rage of which during that period is 51.  Several of these came
from the neiohbouring parishes; but it is probable that about an
equal number of persons who died in this parish were buried out of
it, so that the above may be held as a fair average of deaths.
The following table of the ages of the present population is
drawn up from notes taken in course of a pastoral visitation in
1836.

<TABLE>
Under 15.    Between 15 and 30.	 Between 30 and 50.  Between 50 and 70.
  1258.               768.                  837.                303.
                Between 70 and 90.      Between 90 and 100. Total 3305.
                         144.	                   5.
The number of unmarried men, bachelors,	and widowers, above 50 years of age, is
                         about                                                 65
                        women upwards of 45 years of age, including widows,
                         about                                                150

   There is 1 insane person, 5 fatuous, 3 blind, 3 deaf and dumb;
-three of those who are fatuous are also deaf and dumb.

<FOOTNOTE>It often happens that only one of the parties proclaimed resides within the pa-
rish.  In the above estimate two such proclamations are accounted equivalent to one
marriages.
