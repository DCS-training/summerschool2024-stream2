   Black Cattle-The breed of black cattle is, in general, in-
ferior in shape and pile to the Argyll-shire or Isle of Sky cows,
but superior to those, in the low parts of the north of Scot-
land.  Their number is about 2400 When properly fed,
they give plenty of milk, and bring between 5 L. and 6 L. a
piece, in the market.

   Sheep and Goats.-About 20 years ago, the farmers began
to stock with sheep  At that time, the number of sheep was
1000; now it is 18,000, all of the black faced kind.  They
are generally smeared in the beginning of winter.  The lambs
are often attacked, on the approach of their first winter, by the
braxy, a disease which seems to he of the nature of the gastritis.
Goats are not so numerous as formerly.

   Wild Quadrupeds and Birds.-Red deer come here for food
and shelter in severe winters.  Roes breed in our woods.
Hares, rabbits, foxes, wild cats, badgers, otters, moles, pole-
cats, weasles, and black martins, are also to be found here.
Our domestic, migratory, and water fowls, and birds under the
denomination of game are the same as in other places of this
country, as well as our birds of prey.

   Fish.-Salmon are found in the Teath, and in the northern
branch thereof, all the way to Balouhidder.  They are more
rare in the southern branch, owing probably to the large pikes
in Loch Vennachoir and Loch Achray, which are enemies to
other fish.  Trouts abound in all the lakes and streams of this
parish; and pass in every stream.  Whitlings, which some
fishermen say are young salmon, and which others reckon a
distinct species of trout, are common in the Teath, in July and
August.  Char have been discovered in Lochlubnaig; and,
when pickled, are found to equal any from the lakes in the
