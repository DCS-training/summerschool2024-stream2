cing annually large crops of grass, very fit for hay or pa-
sturage.  These, because of their low situation, are drenched
with water mostly all the winter and spring, which cir-

crop.  Most of our hills or rising grounds, and also of our
moors, are well adapted for what we call ordinary or High-
land pasturage, and capable of maintaining a very great
number of cattle.  These circumstances, together with the
want of inclosures and winter herding, are in a great
measure the causes why the people do not trouble them-
selves with raising any crops of clover and rye-grass.
Of late years, indeed, several attempts have been
made this way, which have been very successful; and
it is to be hoped, that this useful pratice will soon
become more general.  The rest of the parish consists
of swamps, marshes, bogs, or deep moss, all of great
extent, but very fit for Highland pasturage for the
greatest part of the year.  When to these are added the
great number of lakes or lochs, small and great, which are
almost in every quarter of the parish, there is reason to be-

all, it will be allowed, that it has the greatest variety, the
greatest advantages, as well as the most pleasant and enter-
taining prospects, of any parish in the county.

another,-Disadvantage from that Influence.-Though the
climate is not in general very agreeable, yet I am persua-
ded it is much better than it is represented and imagined
to be by people of other countries.  For they who come
only for a start into the country, have no great opportunity
of knowing it; and they who never were in it, are, from
the report of those who were, prejudiced against it.  Be-
sides, from its more northern situation, they are apt to con-
clude that the difference between this climate and theirs is
