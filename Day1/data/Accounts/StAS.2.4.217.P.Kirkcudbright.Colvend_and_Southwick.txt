                 COLVEND AND SOUTHWICK.               217

The state of farm-buildings and enclosures has undergone a great
change in the last forty years. Number of farms, 71; rent from
L.10 to L.560.
	Live-Stock.--There are fed in the parish between 40 and 50
score of black-faced sheep, and a few score of other kinds. The
cattle are almost all of Galloway breed.
	Quarries.--There are two mill-stone quarries in, the parish; but
they have not been wrought of late.
	Navigation.--Coasting vessels are employed in shipping grain
to Liverpool, Dublin, Glasgow, &c.; in the herring fishery; and
in bringing coal and lime from the English side. There are an-
nually exported from the parish, about 4000 bushels of barley, and
5000 stones of meal.
	The Barnhourie sand-bank, so fatal to vessels, especially to those
which are strangers to the coast, runs from the mouth of the Urr
to the Nith. Nearer to the English side is another bank called
the Robin Rig.
			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church is extremely ill situated
for the united parishes. The nearest part of Southwick is four
miles, and some farms are distant seven miles. It was built in
1771, and is too small for the present population.
	The manse was built in 1804. There are about twelve acres
of globe, partly at Colvend, and partly at Southwick: value of
both glebes about L. 20 per annum. The teind was exhausted by
last augmentation in 1824, and amounts to L.232.
	There is a meeting-house belonging to the Secession, about
seven miles from the parish church. It is ill attended, and would
be still more so, if the parish church were centrically placed.
	Poor.--There are on the poor's roll, at this time, 44 persons.
The fund for distribution arises chiefly from the collections, in
church.

	February 1844.
