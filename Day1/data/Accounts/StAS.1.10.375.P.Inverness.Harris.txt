   In the north end of the Island Of Calligray, there are saint
traces of a very ancient building, called Teampull na h' Annait,
i.e. the temple of Annat, a goddess mentioned by mytholo-
gists, as having for her particular province the care of young
maidens.  Near this temple is a well of water, at which the
worshippers purified themselves, called tobar na h'Annait,
and the point of land on which it is situated is called Ru
na h'Annait.
   Among the monuments of antiquity, we rank the Danish
forts, with which the whole coast of the Hebrides and wes-
tern continent is lined, and of which there is here a consi-
derable number.  They scarcely deserve a particular enu-
meration, and their general description is well known.  They
are situated on high eminences, and built in a circular form,
of large square stones strongly knit together without any ce-
ment.  Two of them are always placed in sight of each o-
ther.  They were used as signal towers as well as fortresses.
The alarm of the first appearance of the invading foe, being
almost instantaneously communicated to the whole country
by means of a fire lighted in the tower from whence the dan-
ger was first observed, and immediately repeated by the next
in view, till the communication ran almost as quick as light-
ening, through the whole chain.  For this purpose a centi-
nel, called Gokman, was continually kept on the highest part
of the wall, whose bussiness it was, on espying a fleet at sea,
to light the fire, and the gokman on duty in the fort im-
mediately communicating with this, instantly repeated the
signal.  One of the largest and most conspicuous of these
forts is situated in Borve or Borough, on the mainland of
Harris, which, from this circumstance as well as the name,
appears to have been, for some time, the residence of a bo-
dy of Danish marauders headed by a chief.  It is remarkable
that in the Long lsland there are several places of this name,
