and a sum is paid by the Exchequer to bring it up to the legal
minimum of L.150.
	The patronage of the church and parish belonged, of old, to the
Bishop of Galloway, who is supposed to have had a residence at En-
rig in the parish ; and some venerable trees there are still called the
Palace trees." Soon after the Reformation, namely, in 1587,
the patronage was transferred to the King, but was, next year, be-
stowed on William Melville, commendator of Tongland, after-
wards a Lord of Session, under the title of Lord Tongland after
who died in 1618.* (Murray's Lit. Hist. of Galloway, 2d edit.,
1832, p. 23.) On the re-establishment of Episcopacy in 1606,
the patronage of Girthon was anew vested in the Bishop of Gal-
loway, but this was not to take effect till Melville's death; and at
the Revolution it was restored to the Crown, to which it has ever
since belonged. (Caledonia, iii. 330.)
	At the Reformation, the revenues of the parsonage and vicarage
of Girthon were let to John Gordon of Kenmure, for L.11.3, 6s,
8d. Scots; but owing "to the non-payment of the pasch fines,
cors present, and umest [uppermost] claithes," the lease was re-
duced. (1b.)
	There is at present a small " Free Church" congregation in
Gatehouse, who assemble in the Mason Lodge, having no sepa-
rate place of worship of their own. The Independents had, for,
thirty years, an ordained minister here; but at his death, a few
years ago, no successor was appointed. Of the fate of the Epis-
copal chapel we have already spoken.

ent sects of Christians in the parish, previously to the late disrup-
