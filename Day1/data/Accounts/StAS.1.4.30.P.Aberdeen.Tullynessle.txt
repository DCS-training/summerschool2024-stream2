generally sends to market a good deal of meal, as also cheese,
butter, poultry, and eggs.  The rent of 2-3 ds of the pa-
rish occupied by tenants, may amount to L. 254: 10.4
in money, and 140 bolls of meal.  The best infield land lets
at an average for about 16 s. 8 d. the acre; inferior about
10 s and outfield from 2 s. 6 d. to 5 s. according to its qua-
lity; but, in general, the tenants pay in meal, in place of
money, for the outfield grounds.  Land is sold at an ave-
rage at 25 years purchase; but no change of property has
taken place in this parish for many years, or is likely to
happen for many more.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-It may without exaggeration be as-
serted, that the prices of provisions are double, if not triple,
of what they were about 30 years ago.  About that time,
an ox sold for 20 s. which now costs at least L. 5, or L. 6;
sheep, 3 s. to 4 s. for the best wedders; now the common
price is from 6 s. to 10 s. 6 d.; 2s. 6 d. to 3 s. for the best
ewes and lambs; now they fetch from 5 s. to 7 s. or more.
Hens then sold for 3 d. now 6 d.; eggs 1 d. the 14, now 2 d.
the dozen; meal was sold in general for 6 s. 8 d. the boll,
now it sells from 10 s. to 12 s.

   The ordinary wages given to labourers when hired by the
day are 6 d.; tailors 5 d. or 6 d; wrights 8 d.; masons 1 s. 2 d.;
all exclusive of victuals.  The annual wages of men-ser-
vants employed by farmers, are in general above L. 5; of
women-servants, from L. 2, to L. 2, 10 s.  Thirty years
ago, the wages of the former run from L. 1: 6: 8, to L. 1,
13 s. 4 d.  Harden cloth sold for 2 1/2d. the ell, (it now sells
for 8 d. or 9 d.,) and shoes for 1 d. the inch in length.

able to work, may and do bring up their families tolerably
