      Character -fthe People.-The peasantry are intelligent sober,
   and industrious,although the practice, wbich has become so universal,
   of hiring servants at markets is found to be producing detriorat-
   ing effects on morals. The fishing people are here a distinct race
   distinguished eminently,, the female sex more especial for their
   great civility, sobriety, cleanness, and proper behaviour in . every
   respect. Instances of thoughtlessness and improvidence may be met
   with, and then misery and want will be met with, too, as inseparable
   concomitants; but the careful and the temperate live contented
   and happy, having abundance of the necessaries and a few even of
   the luxuries of life, in neat, well furnisbed, and comfortable cabins.
   Taken as a bod , the inhabitants, both seafaring and landward,
   respect religious ordinances, and regularly attend on them, and
   when they come out on the Sabbath, dressed in their best attire,
   the very respectable appearance and devout manner they exhibit,
   seldom fail to attract the notice of a stranger. It is to. be hoped
   too, that whilst, with very few exceptions, they have all the form
   of godliness, many of them are blest by the experience of its power.
