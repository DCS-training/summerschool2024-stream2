     The Statistical Account.

There is hardly any continuance of frost in this valley to in-
terrupt the navigation in the winter season.  Lochness never
freezes, and Loch Lochy seldom.  Now, if the canal were
made on a large scale, (from 16 to 18 feet deep,) there mould
be almost a certainty of its continuing always open; especial-
ly when we take into the account the number of springs
which abound at the bottom of such high mountains, many
of which must be opened in the tract of the canal.
   Another thing worthy of notice is, that the summit (or
highest ground at Lagan-achandrom', between Loch Lochy
and Loch Oich, which is a flat, about two miles long, and
half a mile broad,) could be constantly supplied with water
from both sides by two burns; one shelving down the hill on
the south side, about the middle of the ground, and another
larger one on the north side, which runs into Loch Lochy at
the west end of the summit, but which could easily be
brought into the canal, if found necessary.
   Upon the whole, the facility of accomplishing a work of
such magnitude and importance, highly deserves the atten-
tion of every one who has the interest of his country at
heart.  May I, therefore, be permitted to indulge the pleas-
ing hope, that one, who has so eminently distinguished him-
self, in promoting national improvements, as Sir John Sin-
clair, will, at some seasonable time, use his influence to di-
rect the attention of government and of the public to this
great object?  The happiness of thousands of virtuous and
loyal subjects, as well as the internal wealth and strength
of the British empire, might be promoted by it.  This, at
least, is the persuasion of one, who, though little acquaint-
ed with the world, and confined to a retired corner, re-
joices in the prosperity of his country, and, if in his power,
would cheerfully promote it.  This being his firm persua-
sion, he humbly hopes, it will be deemed a sufficient apo-
