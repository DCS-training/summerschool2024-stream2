cattle to the English markets After every accession of agri-
cultural and mechanical knowledge, it is a question but the
old observation on Galloway, and especially this part of it,
may hold good, "Universa pecoris quam frumenti fertelior."
More especially of late, many creditable people have conten-

tures regarding them liberal.  There is not one village in all
the parish, nor is there any kind of manufacture.  Indeed,
for many years past, the want of fuel seems to have acted as
a prohibition respecting both.  Even the vestiges of some
villages, of which we read in the charters of some estates,
cannot now be discerned.  Of wood there may be growing,
and even fit for cutting, at this day to the value of 10,000 l.
and the late plantations abundantly repay the care and in-
dustry of the owners.  Ash and oak are the trees most com-
