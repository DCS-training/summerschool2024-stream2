     PARISH OF SCONE.

     (COUNTRY OF PERTH.)

     By ROBERT THOMAS, Preacher of the Gospel.

     Name.

   THIS parish has always borne its present name.  It is
sometimes written Scoon, but more frequently Scone.
The word is supposed to be of Gaelic original.  The people in
the Highlands call it Skain, those who live at a remote distance
pronouncing both vowels, and those who live nearer pro-
nouncing the a only, which they sound like the English
long a.
   The word Skain in Gaelic is said to signify a rent.  But
though there are several chasms, or deep openings of the
earth formed in several places by the constant action of two
brooks; yet, there is no mark of any such convulsion of na-
ture, as this origin of the name might be supposed to in-
dicate.

   Situation, and Extent.-It is situated nearly due north from
Perth, in the county and presbytery of Perth, and in the
synod of Perth and Stirling.  It is bounded on the west by
the river Tay, which separates it from the parishes of Perth
