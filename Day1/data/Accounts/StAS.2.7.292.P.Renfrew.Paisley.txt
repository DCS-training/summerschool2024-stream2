   Among the friendly societies of Paisley, we cannot omit noti-
cing the "Female Union" and the "Female Friendly" both found-
ed in 1820, and managed entirely by respectable females of the
operative classes, and for their relief in sickness.  They have suc-
ceeded on the whole remarkably well, and deserve to be exten-
sively imitated.
   Dispensary and House of Recovery.-In 1786, a public Dispen-
sary was established in Paisley by subscription; and about fifteen
years after, a commodious "House of Recovery" or public infirmary
for the reception of persons labouring under contagious disease was
erected.  Additions have from time to time been made to it; and
it now accommodates about 45 patients.  It is managed by a com-
mittee, annually chosen by the subscribers, along with all those who
may be annual subscribers to the amount of L.3, 3s. and upwards.
Its more immediate superintendence is committed to a house sur-
geon and apothecary; a matron, and two or more house-servants,
as may be required.  Six of the medical practitioners in town act
as medical directors, and visit the patients in the house, and those
on the rolls of the dispensary.  Two of the managers, with a me-
dical director, visit the house weekly, or oftener if necessary, and
report their observations in a book kept for the purpose.  In 1835,
the patients admitted to the benefits of both departments were
1595; and the number in all since 1786 has been 36,268.  The
expenditure of the year 1835 was L. 466, 11s. 10 1/2d.; a small sum
indeed, when we take into view the immense good done to the fa-
milies of the poor, and to the general health of the place.  An an-
nual report is published, of the numbers and cases admitted, with
the several results, the lists of diseases on the journals of the house,
state of accounts, and general management for the year.
   The following table will shew the comparative number of Fever
cases, and those of general distress, wbich have been received into
the house during the last ten years.

a philosophical institution, embracing all the branches of physical
