or a line of our psalms in metre, and does not begin to rever-
berate till the voice of the speaker has ceased.  When the
speaker moves a few yards from his first station, 2 echoes are
heard, and, proceeding a little farther, in the same direction,
3 echoes are repeated.  The form of the ground from the
church to the station of the speaker is hollow, and nearly
in the shape of a semicircle.-About 3 miles westward
from the church, are seen the vestiges of Castlegory, or
Castlegregory, where it is said that Gregory, king of Scot-
land, resided; and the names of several places in the neigh-

Park Conon.  A proprietor in the parish has informed the

seems to have been very much adapted to both the above
mentioned purposes.  On the top of this hill there is a large
cairn, now covered with grass, and hollow in the middle,
where the baron held his courts.  From it there is one of the
most extensive prospects in this country.  There is a view of
the Grampian hills, for more than 30 miles, the coast of Fife
for about 18 miles, the Isle of May, the Lowmonds of Fite,
Largo-law, and the German Ocean for above 50 miles.
