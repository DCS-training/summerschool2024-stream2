flooded.  The water is brackish in its taste, fromthe quantity pour-
ed by the Beauly into the Frith.  In the broadest part, the Frith of
Beauly may be three miles.  Its depth may average from one to
six or seven yards. There are several, excellent springs in the parish.
   Geology and Mineralogy -There are no limestones, granites,
or porphyries, as yet discovered in this parish, the prevailing rock
being the old red sandstone. Mines are not here known.  The
quality of the soil, as already stated, is various.
     Zoology.--Serpents are found, but are not numerous.  There are
also foxes and polecats; but, as there are not many sheep reared
in the parish, their haunts are not narrowly looked after.  There
are no rare species of animals known in this parish, nor am I aware
that any which formerly existed in it are not now to be met with.
The roe and roebuck are now more numerous than they have been'
owing to the shelter and protection afforded them in the extensive
plantations on the Redcastle property. The different species of
cattle now reared in the parish are, horses, cows, hogs, and sheep.
  The insects which are common to other parts of the country are to
be met with in this parish.  Mussels and whelks are plentiful on our
side of the Beauly Frith, in the east end of the parish.  The mus-
sels are used by the fishers of the parish of Avoch for bait for their
small lines: and both are used for food by the poor people in SUM-
mer when meal is scarce.
  Botany.--There are no very rare natural plants known here.
There are very large plantations of Scots fir and -larch, intermixed
with hard wood, particularly oak, ash, and birch, on both the pro-
perties, but chiefly on that of Redcastle.  The wood plantations
are very extensive, occupying 2533 imperial acres, 2 roods, 'and
14 falls.  The plantations are seemingly thriving.  Ash, elm,
beech, and plane trees, of very large dimensions, are also to be met
with in various.parts of the parish.
