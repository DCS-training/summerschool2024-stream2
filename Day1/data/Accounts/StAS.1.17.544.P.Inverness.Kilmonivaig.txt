     Statistical Account

   Soil.-Owing to the irregular surface, and vast extent of
this parish, the soil is extremely various, but chiefly partakes
of a light sandy nature, and sometimes of a Black loam.

   Agriculture-has made little progress in this country, as
the whole parish is more suited to grazing, particularly sheep-
farming; another cause that may be assigned for this, is, that
the wetness of the climate is an invincible bar to the raising
of corn, sufficient for the subsistence of the inhabitants.  The
only crops are barley, oats, and potatoes; the last of which
is the staple commodity.  The number of sheep in this parish
amounts to about 60,000, that of black cattle to 1500, and
the number of horses may be computed at 500.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants amounts to about
2400, of whom about 1200 are Protestants, and 1200 Roman
Catholics.  The return to Dr Webster in 1755, was 1400
Papists, and 1595 Protestants, total 2995.  The decrease
consequently is, at least, 495 souls.

   Wages and Prices.-Masters of families in this country la-
bour undcr difficulties in regard to servants, being obliged to
give a shilling per day to the men, and a sixpence to the
women.  The prices of most of the commodities of life are
exceedingly extravagant, oat meal in particular, which, com-
munibus annis, may be rated at 18 s. only 8 stones to the boll,
and seed corn at the same price.  Owing to the want of a
public market, the price of beef and mutton cannot be as-
certained; none being nearer than that of Inverness.

   Manners.-The same hospitality which characterised the
ancient Caledonians, of whom they may be considered the
genuine descedants, continues to be practiced.  Another
