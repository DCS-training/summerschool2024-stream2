near 2 1/2 miles, and the N. side one mile.  The low grounds
taken alone form also an oblong, the length of the sides
from E. to W. being rather more than 2 1/4 miles, and the
breadth from S. to N. about 1 1/2 mile.

   Extent and Elevation.-Tillicoultry consists of more than
6000 Scotch acres, of which quantity, 4000 are in the
Ochils, and the remaining 2000 acres form the low arable
ground at the foot of the hills, and to the south of the bank
dykes.  About 1100 or 1200 acres of arable land, by far the
best and most valuable in the parish, lie between the bank
dykes, at the foot of the hills, and the lowest part of the
banks of Balharty and Coalsnaughton, south of the Dovan,
and about 800 or 900 acres lie south of the river, from the
foot of the banks.  The hills, according to an actual survey,
exclusive of the Mill-Glen farm, contain 2902 acres.  The
elevation of the ground, on the north banks of the Dovan;
at the bridge, is not more than 20 feet, or at most 30 feet
above the level of the Forth, at spring tides; and the S. W.
corner of Tillicoultry, which approaches nearest to that river,
is distant from it about 3 miles.  The ground at Coalsnaugh-
ton is near 300 feet above the Dovan; and at Balharty it is
about 300 feet.

   Soil and Surface.-The soil is in general dry-field, rich in
quality.  When properly taken care of, it bears excellent
crops, both of corn and hay, and gratefully repays the labour
of the husbandman.  At the foot of the hills, the soil is a
fine quick loam, but not very deep.  The crofts are, in many
places, covered with stones almost innumerable, smooth in
their surface, and in general twice as large as a man's fist.
They appear to be natural to the soil, and not brought thi-
ther by any inundation; but many entertain a different opi-
