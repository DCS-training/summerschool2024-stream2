as can supply the inhabitants of the parish.  The last consti-
tute a large proportion of the food of the families of the far-
mers in winter, and a still larger of those of the labourers and
tradesmen.-The proportion of the ground employed in rai-
sing oats is yearly diminishing.-Formerly the distinction 
betwixt infield and outfield was universal, and on the infield
one crop of barley was followed commonly by two crops of
oats.  The outfield was alternately three years in ley, and
three years in tillage, and oats alone were sown on it.-But this
slovenly method of distinguishing grounds into outfield and in-
field is fast wearing out; some farmers have gone so far even
as to reverse that management which formerly was reckoned
good; and instead of taking two crops of oats and one of bar-
ley, they take two of barley and one of oats.  This can suc-
ceed only on such grounds as are well cultivated.-This mode of ma-
nagement is after the ground has been one, two, or even three
years under grass, to lay dung on the surface in the beginning
of winter, and plough it in immediately, harrow in spring, un-
til the ground furrow is so much broken, that the ground ap-
pears quite smooth, and plough it for sowing the barley in
the beginning of May.-The produce, in this management, far
surpasses any that has been known on these grounds, in any o-
ther mode of cropping; a field of 5 1/4 acres was sown with 3 1/3
bolls of barley, and produced 52 bolls.  The second crop is oats,
the third barley and grass seeds.-The culture of flax was tried
to some extent some years ago for sale, but it is now confined
in a great measure, to what is used in the farmer's family.-
Turnips are little cultivated, although dryfield is well adapted
for them, and their culture secures an essential part of good hus-
bandry, as so much rain falls ordinarily in harvest, as will e-
ver prevent pease from being cultivated to advantage.-The 
small extent of the farms, the want of a sufficient number of
