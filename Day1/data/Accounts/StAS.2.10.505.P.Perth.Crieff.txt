the parish, viz. Ferntower, Inchbrakie, and the Broich; and the
chief manufactories are three tan-works; a barley, a flour, and two
corn mills; a bark mill; a flax, anf a flax-seed-oil mill; a saw and
turning mill; a woollen manufactory, and two distilleries. All these
manufactories (with the exception of the tan-works) are situated
on the river Turret, and within the space of three quarters of a mile.

			III.-POPULATION.
     The population of the town has for a long time been increas-
ing; sometimes rapidly;* and Crieff now contains more inhabi-
tants, perhaps, than it dhd at any former period. But, owing to
the decrease of the country population, especially that of Glen-
almond, the gross population of the whole parish, quoad civilia,
has been proportionally slower in its growth than the population of
the town.
  The following table presents a view of the population from
1755 to 1837, and contains all the information which we have
been alble to collect on the subject.

<FOOTNOTE>The principal cause assigned for the rapid increase of the population of Crieff,
previous to the year 1792, is that, having little trade, and being ignorant of the
meants by which any money they had acquired, could be improved to advantage, the
people thought themselves fortunate in having it in their power to invest it in a house
and garden of their own property; a spirit which the proprietors of the town were
then disposed to encourage and gratify, by granting small feus to those who were in.
clined to build upon them.
