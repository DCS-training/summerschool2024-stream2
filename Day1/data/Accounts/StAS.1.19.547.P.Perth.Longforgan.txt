the spring by another furrow, as early as the season will per-
mit; immediately after which it is harrowed, then plough-
ed across the ridges, and the beans sown in every third fur-
row*:  After sowing, hurrow the field well, and then let it
lie until the beans be near appearing through the ground;
then barrow it again to destroy the annuals; and after the
beans appear distinctly, hand-hoe them, harrow between
the drills with a narrow harrow, and proceed as in dressing
other drilled crops.  Upon black land, beans are sown in ge-
nerally in longitudinal drills, in the month of March; pease,
March and April; outs, March and April; barley, from
April to June, according to the species of the grain; the
Lincolnshire should be sown very early.  Grass feeds, which
consist of rye-grass and red clover, are generally sown with
the barley, because the ground is better prepared; but they
answer fully as well with oats+, or even among wheat,
when sown early in the spring; the ground being first open-
ed with a light harrow, and then rolled in; which operation
is, in general, of great advantage to the wheat, as it opens
the soil, and makes the young plants stock or tillar better.
   The principal reason of sowing the grass feeds amongst
barley, is probably on account of the rotation of fixes.  How
far this practice ought to be adhered to, or if any variation
may be introduced with success, the experience of farmers
must judge.  But, in general, the barley in clay is but an
indifferent crop, and therefore some farmers are trying
early oats in their room, or even common oats, which, in
general, gives the best crop.

<FOOTNOTE>

*This is by much the best method clay, as every drill, nay, every
furrow, serves as a drain, and keeps the ground perfectly dry; as all the
rain will fall into the furrows between the ridges, which must be kept open
for that purpose.

+Perhaps the crop of grass is more certain, as it has a better chance from
the spring rains.
