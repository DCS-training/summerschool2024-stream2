of drainage.  So that the only impediment to navigation, is
the mill dam below Thornhill, and a small natural fall in the
river, at that place where it is thought that the bottom is
soft: and the rise could easily be lowered, and the cut above
it deepened, by sluices.
   The tideway of the Forth commences at Craigforth dam,
which is 26 miles distant from Alloa by the river, and 7 miles
in a straight line.
   It is excessively crooked; and its greatest bendings lie near
Stirling, where its channel is narrow, when compared with
that which it occupies at Alloa.  It has several fords in it
above Manor, which do not permit vessels drawing 5 feet
water to pass over them in neap tides.  The tides are three
hours later at Craigforth dam than at Alloa; and the port
at Manor is the highest accessible at all tides for vessels draw-
ing 9 feet water.  That port lies above two great turns of
the river; and vessels may be often hindred from coming to
it by contrary winds and freshes.  The port of Cambus lies
3 3/4 miles farther down, and below the most considerable of
these turns; and the Forth is wider and deeper there.  It
lies in the mouth of the river Devon; is 3 3/4 miles from Al-
loa; and has in the harbour 9 feet water in low neap tides,
and 13 feet and a half in Spring tides.  The bottom at the
quay is composed of loose stones, and may be easily made a
foot or two deeper, as it rises more than that height above
the low waters in the Forth opposite to it.  The bottom of
Devon, above the quay of Cambus, is composed of shelving
rocks, not difficult to quarry; the stones of which may be
useful for building such works as are wanted there.
   The river Devon is smaller than the upper Forth, and lar-
ger than the Goodie.  It comes from the east, and runs for
many miles through a fine valley, where it has a crooked
channel; and the surface of the water is not far below that
