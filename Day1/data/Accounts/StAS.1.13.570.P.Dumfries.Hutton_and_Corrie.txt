Northumberland, that live in the higher parts of these
counties, who would on no account buy any other than
short sheep.  They lay these of a year old on commons and
high fells, where they say long sheep would not thrive.
There are as many farmers in the same counties, who pre-
fer the long sheep, and buy no other; both from an idea
that the kinds they graze thrive best on their grounds, and
consequently make the surest return.  The sheep of the
south of Scotland may be said to be driven wholly to these
countries, and while so decided a preference is by different
buyers given to each kind, it seems at least prudent in the
Scotch breeders, to continue the kinds for which they find
the best demand.
   From the trials made of breeding long sheep upon high
farms in this parish and the neighbourhood, it does not
seem to be well ascertained that black-faced sheep are the
most hardy.  On the farm of Mackmaw, the second highest
in this parish, long sheep were laid in the year 1759; they
were continued for 9 years, and it is granted that no
farm of the neighbourhood returned more to the tenant
than Mackmaw did.  This tenant removed in 1768.  He
was succeeded by a man from Tweeddale, who stocked with
the black-faced sheep he was acquainted with.  This man
cannot be said to have thriven, but there is a difference in
men as well as in sheep.  The present tenant with black-
faced sheep thrives.  It is observed, when there is a gene-
ral failure in sheep by wet and cold seasons, that long
sheep are more generally affected with the rot.  This it is
believed is the case; but it is also the case, that short sheep
generally inhabit the drieft grounds.  Let the farmers who
posses wet grounds in seasons such as 1799, 1791 and
1792, and have short sheep, speak to the advantages they
have had.  If they had such, it is unknown to their
neighbours.
