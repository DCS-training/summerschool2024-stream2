the site of the old manse; its front is to the south, and
the garden before it declines like a hot-bed; the manse is
built in a temporary manner; the walls being insufficient to
hold out rain, consequently, the house is often filled with wa-
ter, and the ceiling destroyed.
   The school-house was built in 1769:  it consists of only 2
apartments; the one is used as the school-house, the other
as the schoolmaster's room.
   The living of this parish, at present, glebe, manse, etc.
included, will be about L. 120 Sterling.  The glebe consists
of 8 Scotch acres, of a good rich soil, and is contiguous with
the manse.-The schoolmaster here, as in many parishes of
Scotland, officiates as session-clerk; his salary is L. 200
Scotch, which, with school-fees and other emoluments, make
his income considerable; as in winter there are upwards of
100 scholars, and in summer there will be 60.
   There are few poor upon the roll, as the other 3 places of
worship support their own poor.
   The school-fees are, English 1 s. 6 d.; writing, 2 s.; arith-
metic, 2 s. 6 d.; and Latin, 3 s. 6 d. per quarter.  Mr Gra-
ham of Kinrofs is the patron.
   In the village of Millnathort there are no fewer than 4
places of worship, viz. the Establishment, the Antiburgh-
ers, Burghers, and Reformers, commonly called Camero-
nians.
   The primary cause of there being Seceders in this parish,
was a Mr Mair, a minister of the Establishment, who, chan-
ging his opinions, preached up the erroneous doctrine of uni-
versal redemption, and was in consequence of this dismissed
from his charge; notwithstanding of this he still continued
in the village, preaching this doctrine, till the day of his
death, to his adherents, who were very numerous, and who
built that large chapel presently occupied by the Burghers.
