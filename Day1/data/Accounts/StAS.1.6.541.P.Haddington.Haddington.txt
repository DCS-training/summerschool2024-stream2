     of Haddington.

   School.-There is no legal parochial school.  The salaries of
the teachers of public grammar, and English schools in Had-
dington, are paid wholly by the town council out of the reve-
nue of the burgh.  The salary of the restor of the grammar
school is 400 merks Scots; and the salary of the master of the
English school, to which the office of music master is conjoin-
ed, is about L. 15 Sterling.

   State of the Poor.-The money expended for the mainte-
nance of the poor is under the management of a committee of
L 1; consisting of the two ministers, 3 chosen annually by the
heritors, 3 by the twon council, and 3 by the kirk session.  The
money required for this purpose, amounted about 40 years a-
go, only to about L. 100 Sterling annually, of which the heri-
tors of the landward parish gave L. 40 Sterling, the burgh
L. 30 Sterling, and the kirk session L. 30; but the expence
has been since gradually increasing, and amounted last year
(1791) to above L. 270 Sterling.  The number of weekly
pensioners is about 130, besides many others who receive oc-
casional charity from the kirk session.
   The increase of the number of poor in this place, is
in a great degree owing to the prevailing custom amongst the
heritors and farmers in the county preserving no cottagers, un-
less such as are absolutely necessary for persons employed in
cultivating their farms; this drives many of the aged and in-
firm into town, where, after a few years residence, they claim
a legal maintenance.  If the number of persons who resort to
this county from the Highlands as reapers, continues to dimi-
nish in the same proportion as it has done for several years
past, our landholders and farmers will fell the baneful ef-
fects of this piece of ecconomy, when it is too late.
