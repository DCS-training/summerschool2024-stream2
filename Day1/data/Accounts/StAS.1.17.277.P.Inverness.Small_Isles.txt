and solan geese.  The periods of their arrival and departure
are too well known to be insisted on.

   Tides Islands, and Harbours.-ln general, the tide of flood
sets north, the tide of ebb south; but it often varies, accor-
ding to the situation of the coasts of the isla ds.  On the
south coast of Eigg, there is a small island called Eillan Chef-
tel which is good for pasture, and a pendicle of a contiguous
farm in Eigg.  A few persons, tending cattle, live upon it
during a part of the summer months only.  The sound be-
tween this island and Eigg, makes a tolerable harbour for a
few vessels not exceeding 70 tons.  It has no great depth of
water, and consequently, with spring tides, such vessels are
apt to take the ground, the consequence of which, in severe
weather, might be dangerous.  This harbour is in the
course of vessels from the point ot Ardnamurchan to isle
Oronsay in Sleat, opposite to Loch Urn, and nearly equi-
distant from the latter and Tobermory.  There are two
entrances to it, the one from the south-west, and the o-
ther from the north-east, in a line parallel to the above
course, and so must be a good outlet for either of the afore-
said barbours.  Within this harbour, a pier has been built
by the inhabitants for the security of fishing boats and small
vessels, but on a plan not sufficiently exfensive for accommo-
dating vessels of the above mentioned size; besides that, it
has been neglected for some time, and become in a manner
ruinous.  If a pier properly planned to afford protection in
case of storms, were built here, this harbour might facilitate
the navigation of herring busses, both north to the fishing,
and south to the market.  It lies in a centrical situation, be-
tween the two former harbours and, if accommodated as a-
bove, might prevent busses, when overtaken by contrary
winds or disagreeable weather, from driving back to either,
