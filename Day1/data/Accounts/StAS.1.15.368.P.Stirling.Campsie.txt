     Statistical Account

consisted originally of three parts: 1st, What they called the
kirk; 2 d, the quire; and, 3 d, the vesty; which corresponded
to the uses required in the Roman Catholic times; it was
repaired in the year 1772:  At present it would be by far too
small for the parish, if a relief meeting-house had not been
erected.  The kirk of Campsie, like most of the churches in
popish times, is situated at the end of the parish; whether
this was from accident, or from choice of the clergy, to fix it
in the most desireable spot, is not easy to determine.  If, how-
ever, the population of this district continues to increases,
there will be an absolute necessity of building a more com-
modious church in a more centrical spot, for the better ac-
commodation of the inhabitants.  I observed, that in the
1649 there was a disjunction and an annexation of consi-
derable portions of this parish to Kilsyth and Baldernock; it
appears, however, by a dispute which lately took place be-
twixt the minister of Baldernock and the heritors of Camp-
sie, anent the augmentation of the stipend of Baldernock,
that the part disjoined was only annexed quoad sacra; and
the probability is, that the proportion annexed to Kilsyth is
in the same predicament.  All the lands in the parish are
now valued, and the free unpropriated tithe is better than
600 L. Sterling annually, as the fund from which the clergy-
men may have future augmentations.  Mr Campbell of Shaw-
field is titular, in virtue of his being the purchaser of the
estate of Kilsyth, from the creditors of the York-building
There is an opinion entertained by some people, that if an
act of Parliament does not render all ministers stipendiaries,
that on account of certain peculiar circumstances, the mini-
ster of Campsie is still titular of the tithes.
   The duties of this parish consist in visiting and regularly
examining the congregation once in the year, besides preach-
ing three discourses every sunday, from the 10th of April till
