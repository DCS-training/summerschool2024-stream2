creased melioration, as well as the inducement which they
would probably require to hold out to improving tenants in
a diminution of the rent.  No man of this description can
commence his operations on a proper scale, without a capital
equal to at least 5 years rent, for reasons obvious to every
person in any measure acquainted with husbandry; and no
man, who is in possession of a capital to thus extent, will be
induced to take a farm, unless he can have the prospect of a
comfortable maintenance, and full melioration for his expen-
diture in building and improvements.  The rent that can be 
afforded by such a farmer must of course be proportionally
low, as the sum which he advances on entering, as the value
of his stocking, (say the necessary horses, farming utensils,
etc.), together with the probable requisite expenditure, are
high; because he has to add the annual interest of these, be-
ing at least 8 per cent.  to his rent.  It is therefore evident,
that the difference betwixt the value of melioration, expen-
diture, and stocking, necessary for the present mode of con-
ducting husbandry, and the value of those as requisite for
the effectual introduction of the more generally approved
system, must be altogether against the proprietors.  This
difference is very considerable.
   Let us view both in a few particulars, as in their probable
consequences affecting the lands in this parish.  First, By
the present system of farming, it is believed that the full
melioration does not exceed two-thirds of the rent, lay, (for
the sake of even numbers) 1400 L.  the interest of which is an
annual tax on the different properties of 70 L.  But by the
modern system, 3 years rent for melioration will be requisite,
say 6300 L. raising the tax to 315 L. per annum.
   Farther, by the present system, the different operations of
husbandry are principally carried on by oxen.  Horses are
(I believe with very few exceptions) used for conducting the
