     Statistical Account

At about the middle part there is a stem or cruive, having
two chests, across to catch salmon, and to prevent their get-
ting up to a great pond below the fall, whence they cannot
be taken by reason of great stones, roots of trees, and other
obstacles carried yearly there in time of great speats; no
fish was ever known to have surmounted the Cascade.  This
river at last disembogues itself into the ocean, at a very short
distance south of Inverkirkag farm house.  There, at cer-
tain times of every tide during the fishing-season, fishers ply
with a yoal, (a little boat), oars, and nets, to catch salmon.
The quantity taken throughout the season is said not to ex-
ceed one and a half last, though in a favourable year, the
fishing may turn out to a few barrels more; however, the
salmon, in regard of quality and relish, are allowed not to
yield to any in Great Britain, being spawned in a river
whose many springs are the purest sources, and also being
catched instantly as they come from the ocean.
   Leaving Coigach barony (which has no right to fish sal-
mon here) south of Inverkirkag river, to which river the
present marches of this parish, with those of Edrachilish,
Creech, Kincardine, and Lochbroom parishes, have been
all along particularly pointed out, the narrator now pro-
ceeds to describe the coast of this parish from the river of
Kirk-ag to the point or land end of Row-store, from which
place he began to show the circuitous march of it.
   The length of this part of the coast, if the uneven, winding,
and in some places, rocky foot road from farm to farm* be
followed, may be found at least to measure 15 miles. The

<FOOTNOTE>

*The farms on this track of coast, and in its neighbourhood, are.  In-
verkirkag, Baddy-na-ban, Knock-nan-nach, Culag, Filin-wintering,
Drumswordland, and Duchlash.  These, as situated betwixt Kirk-ag and
Inver rivers, are called Ed-ra-isk farms. They lie S. S. E of the river of
Inver.
