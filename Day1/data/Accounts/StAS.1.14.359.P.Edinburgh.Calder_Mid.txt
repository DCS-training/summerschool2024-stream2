derably above it.  Though a small part in the southern
part of it be open, swampy, and moorish, yet it is so far
from being pernicious to the health of the inhabitants, that
it seems to have an opposite effect.  I know a person who,
when he lived in a dry country, and on the sea coast, had
frequent and severe fits of the ague; but, upon coming
into the neighbourhood of the marshy part of this parish,
which I have been taking notice of, and into a moorish
situation, he was soon relieved; and for a considerable
time past, he has had no returns of his disease.  In damp
countries, and particularly among the fens of Lincoln-
shire, the ague is a prevailing malady.  Query.  Is
there any antiseptic quality in the water and exhalations
of mossy* ground which has a tendency to prevent this,
and other epidemic diseases?  It is to be remarked, that
the ague is not a very common malady in Scotland.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-It is much to be la-

which can be called a manufacture, is established in this
town or neighbourhood.  A few women and girls get

young men, who remain here, have no other engage-
ments of profit, but common labour, and the mechanical
pursuits which are necessary for the demands of the
town and parts adjacent.  As there is little in which
children can be employed, they remain for a long time
a burden on the industry of their parents.  Mid-Calder
is well situated for trade; the markets supply plenty of
