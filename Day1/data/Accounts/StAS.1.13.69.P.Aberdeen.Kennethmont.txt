consists of infield and outfield.  The former has its name
from being kept under continual culture; and the latter,
from being allowed to go to ley or pasture, after bearing
a certain number of crops.  Of the infield, one-third is an-
nually prepared for bear, and two-birds are laid down
with oats.  The third intended for bear receives a fallow-
ing in autumn, and remains in that state till spring, when
it is harrowed, manured, and gets the seed furrow.  Af-
ter reaping the bear, this field is understood to be in a state
of culture, capable of yielding two crops of oats succes-
sively.  Each of the other two-thirds, in its turn, under-
goes a similar preparation, and is expected to make the
same returns.  Of the outfield, there are two sorts, a bet-
ter and worse.  One half of each is generally in ley, and
the other under tillage.  The better sort usually remains
in a state of rest for 5 years, and is prepared for cropping,
by watering, liming, folding, or pasturing; adding to
this last method, if it can be spared, a little manure of
any kind.  With this preparation, it is judged fit for
breaking up and bearing 4 or 5 crops of oats in succession.
Instead of the common Scotch oats, when a field has been
limed or watered, it is not unusual to sow it with barley
oats, which are reckoned 10 days or a fortnight earlier.
The worse sort of outfield receives a ploughing early in
summer, and remains in that state till towards seed-time,
when it gets a second ploughing, and is sown with a small
black hairy oat.  This is a bad unproductive grain, not
much used; and, with proper culture, might easily be dis-
pensed with, and totally extirpated.  By the above mode
of cultivation, the average produce of the bear may be
5 returns, of the common and barley oats 4, and of the
small black oats 3.  Turnips and potatoes have, for many
years, been cultivated by the heritors with great success,
and the tenants raise a few of each sort for family use only.
