25, and a householder), as 1 to 18.  Marriages, at an a-
verage, produce about 4 children.  The number of inha-
bited houses is 185, and the average of inhabitants for each
exceeds 6, and does not rech 7.

   Agriculture.-Formerly the whole lands in the parish
were employed in rasing corn.  Two-thirds of the ground
was sown with rough bear, and the remaining third with
wheat, oats, peas and beans.  Still a larger proportion of
bear and barley is fown than of any other grain.  Of late
years green crops have been introduced.  Fields are laid
down with clover and rye-grass; cabbages and kail are
raised in the fields, for winter food.  The average rent of
lands may be L. 1, 15 s. and acre.  For the best, L. 2:12:6
is paid.  The land is generally not inclosed, and the rent
is such, that the proprietors imagine the increase would not
be a sufficient compensation for the expence of inclosing.

   Stipend, Church, Poor, etc.-The value of the living,
including the glebe, and converting the victual at 10 s. the
boll (which is rather a low conversion) is L. 82.  The
patron is Sir John Anstruther.  When the church was
built is uncertain.  It certainly was not originally intend-
ed for a church.  Concerning it there are two traditions,
one of which is, that it was some of the cloisters of an
abbey, and the other, that it was the large barn or gra-

which last seem probable.  The manse was built about
the 1720, and received reparations afterwards.  There are
22 proprietors, 7 of these are communities, viz. 3 kirk-
sessions, 2 sea and 2 trade societies; 10 of the heritors re-
side in the burgh.-The number of poor in the parish is
proportionally great.  At the two last general distribu-
