near expired, to take so many crops of oats as to leave his
ground in as bad, if not in a worse state than when he got it.
And it was likewise a general method to pare and burn the
mossy ground, which gave a temporary manure, at the ex-
pence of the soil.  This estate was in 1782 fold before the
Court of Session, in terms of an act of Parliament.  The
managers of the sale divided it into 16 different lots.  It was
exposed at 24 years purchase, amounting to 22,963 l. 1 s. 8 d.

patches of sown grass, turnip, and potatoes; and winter
herding is universally established, which was known of late
years only in this country.  A great bar to improvement,
high multures, are mostly taken away; and the personal ser-
vices paid in the parish are very trifling, and in some places
quite abolished.  The greatest drawback to improvement still
remaining is the casting, drying, and leading of peats or fuel,
which consumes a great part of the summer time that might
be much better employed, and will continue to do so while,

   The wages of a day-labourer is 8 d. sometimes 9 d. a day;
and as, in general, they are but indolent workmen, their pay-

England.  The women employ themselves in knitting stock-
