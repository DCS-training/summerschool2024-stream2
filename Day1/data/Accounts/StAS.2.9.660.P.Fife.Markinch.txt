     But the strata vary in thickness, as well as the coal seams, at
different points in the field. In general the depths from the sur-
face to the different seams may be set down as follows:---From
surface to upper seam, 17 1/2 fathoms; to main coal, 23 do.; to
under coal, 30 do.
     At Balbirnie the engine is erected on the main seam, with a
draft of 25 fathoms, two fathoms being cut below the coal for what
is called a sump or well, so that there are no shafts 30 fathoms
deep. Cuts are carried rights and left from the bottom of the shaft
to the upper and under seams, the depth being 25 fathoms, or 50
yards, as noted above. This engine stands on the lowest part of
the seam, the coal rising on either side of it. The whole field is
thus rendered accessible to the miner, if we except about twenty
acres of the lower seam, which can only be drained by an addi-
tion of power to the water-engine, and by sinking the shaft seven
fathoms deeper. Various bores have been made with a view to the
discovery of new seams of coal, but without success. One in par-
ticular, from the pavement of the main coal, near the centre of
the coal-field, was carried down to the depth of 67 feet 4 inches,
till interrupted by a bed of stone, so hard, that in a whole weed
only six inches were bored through, and the attempt was, there-
fore, relinquished.
     The average price of Balbirnie coal may be stated at 8s. per
ton; but the price varies according to the quality.
     The colliers, in addition to their daily earnings, are allowed a
free house and garden. Coals for their own use are charged to
them at the chewing rate. The following table will give a compa-
rative view of the rate of wages for the years specified. We pre-
mise that a single collier is reckoned to hew at an average ten
loads per diem.
