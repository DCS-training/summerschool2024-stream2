     NUMBER XLIV.

     PARISH OF CRAIG.

     (COUNTY OF ANGUS.)

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THIS parish was originally called Inch-Brayoick, or Inch-
Broyock; by which name, an island of 34 Scots acres,
near the harbour of Montrose, but within the bounds of this
parish, is still known.  It is probably of Gaelic origin; Inch-
broyock, signifying, in that language, the island of Trouts.-
To this day, two-thirds of the fishing ground, around the
island, go by the name of the Trout-shot.-At what pe-
riod, the parish began to be denominated Craig, cannot now
be ascertained.  The continental part was perhaps commonly
called Craig; and when the place of worship was transferred,
from the island to the continent, the whole might obtain that
name.  It was natural to give it that appellation, as the whole
coast, (about 4 miles in extent,) is lined with rock.  It is al-
ways to be found, by digging the ground a little way; and,
in many places, in appears above the surface.
