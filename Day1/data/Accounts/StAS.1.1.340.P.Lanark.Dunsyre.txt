     Statistical Account

The land rent in 1735 was L. 500; it may perhaps be now
nearly doubled; and the parish is divided into twelve farms,
one of which is wholly sheep pasture.  The day-wages of a
mason and carpenter are 1 s. 6 d. each; of a taylor 1 s.; of
a day-labourer 1 s.; ploughmen get from L. 6 to L. 7, and
women servants from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum.  The people
are sober, economical, and industrious.  The servants are
well fed and treated, and, in feed time and harvest, none
in Scotland can be more alert.  The Medwin produces a few
trouts.

   Antiquities.-There is a row of sepuchral cairns running
from the east end of this parish upon the edge of a muir to-
wards Linton.  Two of them the present incumbent has
been opened; in one the body had been buried in a large
coffin of several unwrought freestones, in the other was found
a small urn.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The soil in the parish, and in
all that tract of country which stretches from hence to La-
nark is in general light and sandy; the arable land being fre-
quently interspersed with, or bordering on, peat-moss.  The
soil is well adapted for raising turnips and potatoes, though it
is only of late that the culture of the former has been intro-
duced.  In general, this tract is still uninclosed.  Inclosures,
with belts and clumps of planting, would much improve the
parish, by sheltering the grounds, and mehorating the cli-
mate.  It is a question of importance how these sences could
be made at the cheapest rate.  Thorn-hedges are impracti-
cable here, as the soil has many variations from good to bad,
where thorns cannot be reared.  Stones are not every where
to be got; and, besides, the poverty of the ground will hardly
bear the expence of erecting atone-walls.  Perhaps turf-dykes,
