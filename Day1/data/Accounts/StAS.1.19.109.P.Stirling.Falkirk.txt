which is very valuable in quality, might easily be enlarged
by encroaching farther on the sea.  Lord Dundas, by this
method, has lately added about 70 acres to his estate.
About the beginning of this century, a Dutchman, who
was well acquainted with operations like these in Holland,
proposed to the Duke of Hamilton to gain for him 2000
acres off the sea, adjoining his estate of Kinneal, in the pa-
rish of Borrowstounness, provided he should be allowed to
possess it rent free for forty years, and be furnished with
timber, etc. from the Duke's wood in the neighbourhood.
The proposal was rejected; and the sea continues to roll
its tides over those shallows, where fruitful fields might
now have been yielding an annual income of L. 4000 or
L. 5000 to the proprietor, and a considerable quantity of
provisions for the supply of this populous part of the
country.
   But the most prominent feature of antiquity, in this pa-
rish is the Roman wall, built in the reign of the Emperor
Antoninus Pius, under the direction of his Lieutenant Lol-

cola had previously erected a chain of forts.  It is more
than 1600 years since the wall was built, and yet in seve-
ral parts, both in this parish and elsewhere, its form and
course are visible.  It extends from the frith of Forth to
the river Clyde, and was about 40 Roman, or 37 English
miles in length.  Carriden, Kinneal, and Blackness, on the
east, Dumglas and Old Kirkpatrick on the west, have, by
different people, been suggested as its boundaries.  Bede
says, that it began two miles from the monastery of Aber-
corn, and ended at Alcluith, which appears to be the same
place which is now called Dumbarton*.  If the wall ter-
