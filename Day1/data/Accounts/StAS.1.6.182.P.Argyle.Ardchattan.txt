rapidity, and at ebb, it returns with a violence and noise une-
qualled by the loudest cataract. But there is sufficient depth
of water, between the ridge of rocks and the land on the west
side, for vessels of any size or burden to pass and repass with
safety in the beginning of stood or ebb.  There is a ferry here,
and notwithstanding its alarming appearance, one of the safest
in Scotland, as no accident has happened at it in the remem-
brance of any man living.
   The sides of Loch-Etie are pleasant; indented into creeks
and bays, affording safe anchorage in any wind whatever; de-
lightfully variegated with hill and dale, meadows and corn-
fields, wood and water.  There are several salmon fisheries on
its shores; and it abounds with small red cod and cuddies;
and, in some seasons, a few herrings are caught in it.  Seals
are its constant inhabitants; and porpoises visit it in the lat-
ter end of April, and take leave of it about the close of July.
   The tide flows six hours, and takes the same time to return:
it runs from Connel in a S. E. direction to Bonawe, and, after
running along the north side of Cruachan-bean, bends its course
N. E. till it terminates in Glenetie, i. e. the valley of Eta, famous
for being the residence of Usnath, father of Nathos, Althos, and
Ardan; the first of whom ran away with Darthula, wife of
Conquhan, King of Ulster in Ireland, which is the subject of
a beautiful poem of Offian.  Many places in and about the
loch and valley of Eta confirm, beyond a possibility of doubt,
that such people were once resident there.  In particular, a
small island, with some vestiges of a house upon it, goes by
the name of Elain Usnich, or the island of Usnath.  There is
also, in the farm of Dalness in Glenetie, a rock rsing in the
form of a cone, on the end of a high hill, commanding a ro-
mantic prospect, which to this day retains the name of Gria-
nan Dearduil, the basking place of Darthula.
