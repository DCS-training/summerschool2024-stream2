yet known for that loathsome disease, is not much prac-
tised.

   Antiquities.-The remains of several encampments, and
rows of stones, called tryst-stanes, are antiquities, probably
of the most ancient date in the parish.  The tryst-stanes are
commonly on high ground.  They are placed perpendicu-
larly in rows, not unfrequently in a circular direction.  It
is said, as also the name imports, that, in times of hostilities,
they marked the places of resort for the borderers, when
they were assembling for any expedition of importance.
The ruins of Whitton-castle and Corbet-house are the only
remains of large buildings or places of strength in the pa-
rish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The roads in the parish, of
which none are turnpike, are very far from being good,
and are often almost impassable.  Two public houses (small
ones) in the village serve the inhabitants and passengers
with refreshment.  Formerly there were four mills in the
parish; now two are found to be sufficient to grind all the
corn that is needed by the inhabitants.  About 20 acres
may contain all the growing wood in the parish, and these
were but lately planted.  The chief dependence for fuel is
on coal brought from the English border, and which sells
at a high price.  There are a few peat-mosses in the parish,
but the people, in general, are so much occupied in the field,
during summer, that the casting and preparing of peats are
greatly neglected.
