   The proportion between the annual births and the
whole population is as 1 to 26; between marriages and it,
as 1 to 85; between annual deaths and it, as 1 to 36.
Each marriage, at an average, produces 7 children.  The
population would still increase were manufactures esta-
blished.  In Dr Webster's report the number is 1790;
but this seems to be exaggerated.  Several go in spring
to the South of Scotland, where they find better encou-
ragement for 1 bour, and most of them return in October
or November following.  None have been ban ed since
the year 1 4, when one suffered that un shment.-
There are 363 houses, 5 in each house at an average;
