home manufacture.  The timber would lay a foundation for
ship-building, and the making of farming utensils; the
charcoal and minerals, for furnaces and founderies; the bark,
for tanneries; and the wool, for spinning, carding, weaving,
and all the other branches of the woolen trade.  No where
are there to be found streams better adapted than thole which
run into Lochow, from their copious and constant supply of
water, to give motion to the machinery used in the various
branches of manufacture.  One of those, the Water of Avich,
which gives name to the parish of Dalavich, merits notice,
from its being particularly suited to the purposes of an exten-
sive cotton work.  It is fed by a fine lake, 3 miles in length,
by one in breadth.  It was never known to have been frozen.

rary was frozen, so as to admit horses and carts, when most
of the corn mills in Scotland were shunt up for a length of

kept constantly going, and afforded relief to the surrounding
counties.
   The introduction of coal would tend to the prosperity of
Lochow and Glenurchy; not only by giving rise to the esta-
blishment of manufactures, but likewise, by enabling the far-
mers to make greater quantities of lime, and to employ, in
the improving of their mosses and moors, that time which is
now consumed in spoiling them, by searching for peats, or in
the more hurtful occupation of cutting down the woods for fuel.
   The promoting of the Lochow Canal, is particularly recom-
mended to those noblemen and gentlemen who have already
subscribed to that of Crinan.  The two canals will be so mu-
tually beneficial to each other, that they ought to have been
included in one common survey, estimate and subscription.
Does Crinan Canal bring the communication with the sea
nearer to Lochow?  The Lochow Canal doubly repays that
