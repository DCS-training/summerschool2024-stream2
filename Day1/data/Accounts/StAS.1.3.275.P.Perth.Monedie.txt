on it, but in seems to have been built before lime known

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is but one public house
at present, which rather deserves the name of a two-penny
house, as there is no entertainment to be had in it, but ale
and Scots spirits.  We have two meal, and two lint mills.
The people are now emancipated from the disagreeable obli-
gation to particular mills, and smithies; and left at full liber-
ty to go where they please.  Some of the meal mills grind
bear into pot barley pretty well, without any additional machi-
nery.  The only river in the parish is Shochie, which is but
small.  It is clear and rapid, owing to its great declivity; it
abounds with trouts, and a stone bridge was lately built over
it, opposite to the kirk, which stands on the south side of it.
There was another bridge built last year, over Condrachie,
where the new high-way, planned and formed by Mr
Graham, crosses that rivulet.  This bridge and high-way,
which is much more convenient, and shorter than the old
one, were executed at the sole expence of Mr Graham; as
well as other two new and very convenient roads, communi-
cating with it.
