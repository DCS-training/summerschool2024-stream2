shay are, Linklets Bay on the east, and Stromness Bay on the
south, neither of them perpectly safe.  Its nesses or points are,
Stromness and Twigness on the south; Bridesness on the
east, and Dennisness on the north-east.  The Seal Skerry,
(so called from its being the resort of seals), lies on the north
side.

   Rocks.-The highest grounds may be 500 feet above the
sea.  The uncultivated grounds are covered with a short
heath.  At the extremity of the isle of Sanday, to the west-
ward, on the shore, for about 200 feet, is a ridge of rocks
shelving to the sea, which appears as if it had been once in a
liquid state, or calcined by fire.  There is no tradition con-
cerning it; but it is worthy of remark, that it bears the name
of Heclabir, which name it probably has retained since the
Danes possessed these islands three centuries ago.  Whether
it has got this name from them, on account of its appearance
being similar to any thing produced by the eruptions of He-
cla in Iceland, the learned can best determine, from the ety-
mology of the word bir.  There are no appearances around
it which indicate a volcano, unless the ocean has covered its
effects.
   There is no marble or moor-stone.  There is free-stone at
the west end of Sanday, where the coast bears a resemblance
to the isle of Eday, from which it is disjoined by a narrow
channel, and which is entirely founded on free-stone.  The
surface also is similar, and the extended point of the one is-
land, in some measure corresponds to the indented bay on the
other.  The soil of the north-east end of Sanday, also bears
a resemblance to that of North Ronaldshay, from which it is
separated.  There are some slates of inferior quality.  For
the best houses, Easdale slates are used.-There are no mines
of any kind.
