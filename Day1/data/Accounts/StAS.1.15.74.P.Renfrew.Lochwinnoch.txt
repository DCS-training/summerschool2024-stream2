   Advantages and Hints for Improvement.-The advantages of
this parish arise from the plenty of coal, lime and free-stone
in the greatest part of it; from its vicinity to Paisley, Port-
Glasgow and Greenock; from the good roads already made,
(including the new lines of road to be immediately set on foot)
and from the rapid increase of manufactures, which must
very considerably augment the value of the land.  With
these advantages, it is hoped that many of the feuers and
farmers, who persist in the old fashioned system of agricul-
ture, may be induced, from the example of others, and a re-
gard for their own interest, to use better implements of
husbandry, to follow a proper rotation of crops, and to at-
tempt the culture of turnips, which are particularly adapted
to the soil of this parish.
