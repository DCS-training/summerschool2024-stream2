of Irvine: As also, of six bolls of multure belonging to the
Carmelite order, all united into one tenement, to be called in
time coming, The King's foundation of the School of Irvine.

   Miscellaneous Observations-The town-house stands nearly
in the middle of the street; but the street at that place is of
so great a breadth, that the building may be considered as
no incumbrance.  It is executed in a plain, substantial man-
ner.  In the ground-floor is the town-clerk's office, with a
room for the meetings of council.  The rest is appropriated
to shops.  Over the entry to the council chamber the town's
arms are cut in stone, being a lion rampant-guardant, with
a sword in one of his fore paws, and a scepter in the other.
Motto,-Tandem bona causa triumphat Higher up in the
wall are also the British arms, very neatly cut in stone.
   In the town there are two branches of banking-houses;
that of the Old Parsley Bank, and of the Ayr Bank.  There
is only one fair worth notice; it is called the "Marrymass
Fair," which begins on the third Monday of August, and
continues the whole week.
   The principal commodities are linen, cloth, horses, wool,
etc.-The bridge over the river of Irvine, being the road to
the quay and to the town of Ayr, was rebuilt in 1748, and
consists of four semicircular arches.  It is too narrow for two
carriages to pass each other.  The tide flows about a quarter
of a mile higher.  There is one mill belonging to the town,
and at a little distance from it, on the water of Annock.  It
pays, of yearly rent, about 60 l.  The inhabitants are thirled
to this mill, and pay 6 d. per boll for grinding oats and malt.
The meal and flesh markets are on the north side of the
street, a little to the east of the council-house.  There is no
public slaughter-house.  The inhabitants pay one penny of
toll for each cart of coals.  Coals to the shore for exporta-
tion pay none.
