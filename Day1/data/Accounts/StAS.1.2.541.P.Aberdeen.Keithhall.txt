cuous:  Formerly, these were made of the hides of oxen, killed
by the farmers, and tanned by the shoemakers of the district.
Now they are chiefly made of English tanned leather, and

nearly from Aberdeen to Peterhead.  Near the old house of
Balbithan, there is a small ring ground, called the Law,
where justice was antiently administered.

Blood.  The Scottish army are said to have killed a boar at
Kinmuck, which denoted the boar's head.  This was an omen 
of victory.-A great multitude of small cairns are scattered
over the moor; and General Gordon, one of the heritors, re-
