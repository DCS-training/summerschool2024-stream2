   Surface, Soil, Climate, etc.-The face of the parish is
very rugged and uneven, with slopes and hollows, rocky
eminences and marshy flats interspersed.  Here and there
stands a small conical hill or a conical ridge, surrounded
with arable ground or with swamps, traversed sometimes
by a rivulet.  Towards the river, the uncultivated ground
is covered with furze and broom; the furze predominates.
As we retire from the river northward, there is much
moor-ground, covered with short heath, and scattered bush-
es of broom and furze.  In two of the higher hills, which
are not, however, of great height, the heath is long enough
to afford shelter to moorfowl; but that species of game
does not abound here.  Partridges are very numerous.-
Towards the river, the soil is gravel and sand, with a small
mixture of earth.  Here and there are interjected small
fields of a fine black mould, fit for any garden productions,
or for any farinaceous grain.  Northward, on the higher
grounds, the soil is a red earth, with a clay bottom.  On
the lower ground, it is a mixture of black earth or peat-
moss.  In many places, the surface is covered with rocks-
and large stones, fit for nothing but building fences; but in
the south and west divisions, granite is found.  In the lat-
ter, there is a quarry of great extent, which has never
been opened.  It is believed that it would furnish mate-
rials for building a very large city, perhaps for building
several cities.  Here stones 7 or 8 feet long are found on
the surface.
   The banks of the Dee are noted for salubrity of air.  In
this parish there is little variation of climate.  The houses
are generally built on high ground, and in a dry situation;
and the people are healthy.  I have not, however, heard
of any remarkable instance of longevity.  Several exceed
80, but few or none arrive at the age of 90 years.  Rheu-
matism prevails among both sexes, especially among the
