     NUMBER LV.

     PARISH OF ABERLADY.

     (COUNTY AND PRESBYTERY OF HADDINGTON, SY-
     NOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDALE.)

     Situation.

   ABERLADY church stands near the shore, about 15
miles east of Edinburgh.  The parish is bounded on the N. W.
by the sea, on the S. by Gladmuir and Haddington, and on
the E. by Haddington and Dirleton parishes, being separa-
ted from the last by the water of Pesser, which falls into A-
berlady bay at Lussness point.  From this point the whole bay
between Aberlady and Gulan shores is left dry at low water
for near two miles. At spring tides, vessels of 60 or 70 tons
may come up the Pesser to within a few hundred yards of
Aberlady, and lie perfectly safe upon a lost clay bottom, if
properly secured by anchors against the N. E. wind.  Along
the shore from Aberlady to the westmont part of the parish,
runs a track or border of links or sandy ground, of con-
siderable breadth, abounding with rabbits.
