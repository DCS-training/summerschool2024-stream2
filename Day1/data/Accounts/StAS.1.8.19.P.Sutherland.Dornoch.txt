watering, the want of a mill, and other difficulties, the profits
are extremely precarious, and the whole process is so tedious
and laborious, as now conducted, that little benefit is derived
from it. To give manufactures, of any kind, a fair chance
of success here, a company, composed of the proprietors of
land, and professional men, should be formed:  The latter only
are fit to conduct such business; and without the protection,
the influence, and co-operation of the former, they would
have many obvious and serious difficulties to contend with.
No where can the poor be on a worse footing than here.  The
principal heritors do not reside in the parish, and therefore
contribute nothing towards their support:  Wandering from
one parish, and from one county to another, the most needy
are often overlooked from ignorance of their real circumstan-
ces, while on the other hand, impostors and sturdy beggars
abuse the generosity and credulity of the public.  It is to be
wished that the poor were universally confined to their own
parishes; that by assessments upon heritors, tenants, and o-
thers, in proportion to their several interests, holdings, and
circumstances, a certain provision were made for their
subsistence; and that employment were furnished them,
suitable to the measures of strength and ability, which they
may be found to possess.  This last suggests an additional ar-
gument in favour of manufactures, as thereby the poor,
at least many of them, would be made to contribute some-
what to their own support, and the public burthens propor-
tionally alleviated.  Upon some such plan, the condition of
the poor would be greatly improved, the public relieved from
incefiant teazing and frequent imposition, and the burden fair-
ly divided among all ranks and characters, in place of falling
chiefly, or solely upon the humane and benevolent, and often
those least able to bear it.
