genious Professor Fergusson, who has made a variety of a-
gricultural experiments, on a small property he possesses in
the parish, which he has changed, in a few years, from a
bare heath, to a scene distinguished for beauty and fertili-
ty.  If ever the stipends of the clergy should come to be
increased, (as has been of late proposed), it would be of
much benefit to the country in general, that this increase
should consist solely in the extension of their glebes.  The
life of a country clergyman, always allows him a great
deal of spare time, which must hang heavy on his hand, if
not occupied either in the pursuits of literature or of agri-
culture, since the constitution of the church bounds his
views, in regard to clerical preferment.  From the society
of his parishioners, he would unavoidably become conver-
sant with subjects of agriculture; and if his globe is made
extensive, so as to render it an object for him to study that
business scientifically, from his more enlarged education,
and often, superior abilities, he will frequently be enabled
to point out a new mode of procedure, which cannot fair
to be of much service to his parishioners; for whatever
example the minister sets, if popular, is generally much
followed by them.  Perhaps too, the duties of his office, can-
not be more properly fulfilled, than by teaching his flock,
by his own example, habits of industry and exertion, in
order to better their situation in this life; which probably
would not be found, the worst preparation for the next, as is
illustrated by our Lord, in his beautiful parable of the ta-
lents.  As it is, many of the improvements in the diffe-
rent parishes, of late years, may be traced to the exertions
of the clergy, in which they ought certainly to receive e-
very possible encouragement.
