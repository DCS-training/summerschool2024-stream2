     of Thurso.

     CHAP. XIII. MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.

   SECT. I.  Public Amusements.-The people in general
are remarkably sober, regular, and attentive to business.
Their favourite, and indeed only public amusement, is dan-
cing, in which they are excellent proficients.

   SECT. II. Societies and Clubs.-They have no clubs, but
there are four friendly societies in town, each of which has
its peculiar rules and regulations, and a fund for the re-
lief of indigent members, &c.  These are, the Society of
Weavers, Fishers, Trades, and United Craftsmen.  The
last is only lately established, but promises to be the richest
society of the four.
   There is a lodge of Free Masons, both numerous and re-
spectable, called Thurso St John's which stands No 45. in
the roll of Scotch lodges.  On festival days, from 50 to 60
Brethren commonly attend, and such is the state of their
funds, that they have it now in contemplation, to build an
elegant lodge-room, which they propose to add to the new
town-house.

   SECT. III.  Inns.-There are two very good inns in
town; and the one having been lately set up, in opposition
to the other, has begot an emulation, and a spirit of rival-
ship in both, which operates favourably to the traveller and
the public.  Mr Morrison, the senior innkeeper, is just now
finishing a large assembly room, which he has added to his
house, which will surpass any thing of the kind to the north-
ward of Inverness.  The dimensions are 37 feet long, by
18 1/2 feet wide, and 16 feet in height.  This innkeeper is
deserving of encouragement from the public, and he meets
with it.
