the purchaser from the plantations, uncut into short pieces, from
1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d. the cart load, as much as the carter chooses to
put on his cart. These prices are for hard-wood; fir is cheaper.
			GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
	Since the date of the former Statistical Account, the popula-
tion of the parish has increased from about 2000 to 3461, and
that of Newstonstewart from 900 to 2241.
	I have endeavoured to make a comparison of the average of
seven years, 1791-1797 inclusive, with the average of seven years
1831-1837, and the following is the result: Grain, taking into
account, oats, barley and oatmeal, has risen between six and seven
percent. The boll of oatmeal of 1O stones of 14 lb. in this pa-
rish has risen 9d. only.
	Rents of good arable land have become nearly triple of what they
were during the former period. I refer to the rents of good land
only, and as there is some bad or inferior land in every farm, the
best arable land must be of more than three times its value dur-
ing the former period.
	The rent of sheep stock farms is nearly double of what it was in
1791-1797; these farms were also much higher rented during
the war.
	The proportion of the present rent and real value of arable
good land to the value of the same land, during the earlier period,
is a most satisfactory proof of great improvement, as the price of
grain is now so nearly what it was then. Great improvement has
been made in the roads since 1797.
	The sheep stock of this parish was stated by Dr Boyd in the
former Statistical Account to amount to about 9840; it is now less.
It has been found advantageous to keep smaller stocks, and have
them in a better state. Some farmers h`ve reduced their numbers
one-sixth or nearly one-fifth, and believe they have gained by doing
so. The regular stock sheep are now rather under 7000 in number.
Besides these, there are at present about 1100 feeding on turnips,
and from 400 to 500 of Cheviot, Leicester; and other breeds, in
the south end of the parish. The sheep stocks have been dimi-
nished by the increase of cultivation also. The stock sheep in
value may average about L.12 a score; during 1791-1797, they
were, on an average, about L.8 a score. From better manage-
ment, and from diminishing the numbers, they are now of really
more value at the same rate than they were then.
