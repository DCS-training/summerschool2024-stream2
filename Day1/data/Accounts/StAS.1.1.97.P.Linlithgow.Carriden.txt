     PARISH OF CARRIDEN.

     By the Rev. Mr GEORGE ELLIS.

     Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.

   THE parish of Carriden*, pronounced Carrin, is situated
in the county of Linlithgow, or West Lothian, about
13 miles west from Edinburgh, on the south side of the Frith
of Forth, is in the presbytery of Linlithgow, and synod of
Lothian and Tweeddale.  It is about 1 mile in breadth from
north to south, and about 2 miles in length from east to west;
bounded by Abercorn on the east, Borrowstounness on the
west, and Linlithgow on the south.  The soil is rather of a
light kind, and agrees better with a rainy than a dry season:
The climate, in general, however, is dry and healthy.  The
land is all arable, and produces grain, grass, and vegetables of
every kind.  It is let out to small tenants generally, most of
whom are poor, and live poorly, at 30, 40, or 50 shillings
per acre.  The greatest part of it is inclosed.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The name is certainly of Celtic original.  In that language,
caer signifies a post or station; and, as it is situated at the
eastern extremity of Graham's dyke, the Romans doubtless, had
a considerable station here.  As to the latter part, it may be de-
rived either from readan, a reed, or reidhe, plain, open; the post
among the reeds, the post in the plain.
