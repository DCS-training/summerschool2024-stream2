   Poor and Parochial Funds.-Pauperism is very much upon the
increase in this parish, and the evils resulting from it are griev-
ously felt. The fine feeling of independence, which so nobly
distinguished even the poorest of Scotsmen in past years, and
rendered them the honour and the pride of Britain, is now pas-
sing fast away, and the demoralising influence, arising from the
want of this spirit, is creeping as a pestilence over this neigh-
bourhood. Instead of spurning from them the parish supply, and
striving to support themselves and their children, by their own
independent exertions, as their fathers would have done before
them, they now court the degrading pittance of parochial aid, and
clamour as loudly for a place in the poor's roll, as though the
highest merit lay in such a distinction. There are at present 35
individuals receiving supply from the parish, the average of whose
monthly allowance is 4s. There are others to whom occasional
relief is given. The assessment for the last seven years averages
L. 139.
   Alehouses.-The number of alehouses not only in this but
neighbouring parishes, calls loudly for an improvement in the pre-
sent system of licensing such nurseries of licentiousness and de-
bauchery.

                       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the
parish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical
Account, are to be found in the improved system of agriculture
now pursued, which, in the hands of a skilful and intelligent
tenantry, is producing effects highly advantageous to the commu-
nity, affording a ready supply of labour to the industrious, and
enhancing the value of the properties, where their capital and skill
are exerted.
