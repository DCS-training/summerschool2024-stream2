warm and dry clothing, and to the cold and uncomfortable
houses of the poorer classes.  Though there are no remark-
able instances of longevity, except one man who died about
10 years ago, whose age was 92, (he was born in the parish,
and resided in it all his life), yet the inhabitants arrive, in
general, to a good age.

as North Berwick; likewise to the Eildon Hills near Melrose,
and Cheviot Hills in Northumberland.  The height of this
hill above, the level of the sea was found by Captain Arm-

The mansion-house of Kirkurd is a modern building, with
an extensive policy.  In the gardens are a green-house, an
ice-house, and 3 small hot-houses. This place was vastly
