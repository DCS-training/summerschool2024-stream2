the rivers that discharge themselves into the Solway Frith.
They are of the size of a good burn trout, or herring, and
are of two kinds, the red and the white; but the red are of
a much superior quality to the other, and are remarkably de-
licate: They afford much sport to the angler.  In the Solway
Frith, great quantities of flounders and cod are taken, and some
times turbot and soles are also caught; the prices, therefore,
of both red and white fish, are, in general, moderate.

   Quarries.-Free-stone, of a very hard and durable kind,
and extremely proper for building, abounds in the northern
and central parts of this parish; but the excellent lime-stone
quarry near Kilhead, has been the sole means of bringing the
waste lands into culture, and promoting the improvement of
every part of the parish.  The limestone got here is of an
exceeding fine quality, and is purchased, either calcined, or
in a raw state, by the whole country around.  The price,
when burnt, is high, occasioned by the duty laid upon coals
imported from the opposite side of the Frith, as it is sold at

ter bushels; but if the duty was taken off, might be afford-
ed at 8 d. or 8 1/2 d. which would be a considerable saving to
the poor farmers, and the loss to the revenue so inconsider-
able, especially when balanced by other advantages, as not to
merit any attention.  The duty upon water-born coal ap-

Scotch side of the Frith, because their neighhours on the
English side are exempted from it, although it is difficult to
determine upon what principle such exemption was founded.
Many applications have been made to government upon this
subject, but the duty still remains unrepealed, to the great
obstruction of the improvement and cultivation of the coun-
