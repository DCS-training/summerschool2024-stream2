   This parish was more populous 70 or 80 years ago than it
is at present.  This decline of population is owing to the
failure of peat and turf for fuel, and the removal of several
persons from hence to Aberdeen, with the view of getting
constant employment.

   Stipend, School, Poor.-The value of the living will be
from L. 70 to L. 75 sterling, including a glebe, 10 acres of
which have been rendered arable by the present incumbent,
at a great expence.-The minister, for some years past,
has kept an academy, taught by two of his sons; at which are
usually from 20 to 26 young gentlemen, some from the West
Indies and Americas and others from England.-The poor
receiving alms constantly, are from 30 to 35, and several are
occasionally relieved: the sum of collections, annual-rents,
and penalties, for their use, is from L. 30 to L. 38 per annum,
of which about L. 4 is collected for, and given to the infir-
mary of Aberdeen.  In 1782 and 1783, many lived very
sparingly and hardly in this parish: the kirk-session bought
meal and pease repeatedly at Aberdeen, when they could be
got, and distributed or sold them out at reduced rates; but
the people have not yet recovered the extraordinary stress and
expence of these years.  The heritors are always doing good,
and contributing to the relief of the distressed.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are generally so-
ber arid industrious; and must be economical, as they can-
