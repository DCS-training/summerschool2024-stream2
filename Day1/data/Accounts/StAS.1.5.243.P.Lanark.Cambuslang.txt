water seldom rises more than 17 feet above the bed of the
river; but in the flood of 12th March 1782, the greatest re-
membered, or on record, it rose 20 feet above the bed of the
river, and 1 foot 6 inches higher than a memorable flood on
the 24th September 1712.  There is only one haugh, con-
sisting of 18 acres of very rich land, liable to be overflow-
ed.  Calder water, which is the boundary of this parish,
for upwards of 4 miles, is rapid and shallow; the channel
about 30 feet broad; but, in its ordinary state, never co-
vered with water.  There are several rivulets in the pa-
rish; but none of these, except one, so considerable as to
merit particular notice.  The principal branch of this one
rises on the confines of the parish of Carmannock, and af-
ter a course of more than 3 miles, first E. and the N.
falls into Clyde, about 3 quarters of a mile below the
kirk.  It has different names at different places; but is
here called the Kirk Burn; having lost its ancient name,
which was probably Cam-eas, or the crooked burn.  This
rivulet, for about a mile before it falls into Clyde, is un-
commonly wild and romantic.  Agreeably to its ancient
name, it makes several turnings and windings.  In some
places, its banks are open and covered with trees and
bushes; but for the most part, it is confined by bold and
perpendicular rocks, from 50 to 100 feet high.

   Prospects.-  This parish is distinguished by its beautiful
scenery, and from the top of Dichmount, there is certain-
ly one of the finest inland prospects in Scotland.  From
Stirling castle, and from Moncreiff's hill, there are pro-
spects in some respects superior; but neither of them
comprehends such an extent of cultivated country, and so
great a variety of hills and valleys.  The highest part of
Dichmount is only about 700 feet above the level of the
sea; but even this small elevation gives it a commanding
