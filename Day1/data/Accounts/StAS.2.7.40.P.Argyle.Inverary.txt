of L.283, 6s. 8d. Sterling, of which the kirk-session were consti-
tuted the guardians, together with L.112, 2s.  Sterling, being the
price of teinds in the parish of Appin, purchased from the Duke
of Argyle by Mr Seaton, then of Appin, and made payable by
the Duke of Argyle to the burgh, for behoof of the grammar
school.  For many ydars, also, and until the teinds were evicted
by a late augmentation of stipend, the tack-duty of the treasury
teinds of the parish of Lismore were made payable by the Duke
of Argyle to the town for behoof of the school.  From these several
sources of revenue, the grammar school was supported ; and
the scholars were so numerous, that, in the eighteenth century,
application was made for permission to place all the children
learning the elementary branches under the charge of a second
teacher, so that the other teacher might be at liberty to devote
all his time to instruction in the higher departments.  In
1803, the second school thus formed became the parochial school,
with tile salary appointed by statute, and the teacher retained,
and has since received the interest of the mortified sum of L.283,
6s. 8d. which were probably allowed him in consideration of the
labour imposed on him as second teacher.
   The salaries of the two teachers at present are,-
