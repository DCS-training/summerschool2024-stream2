time, at Prestonpans in East-Lothian.  When the cobalt is
deprived of the arsenic with which it is strongly impregnated,
and in other respects properly prepared, it produces a pow-
der of a beautiful deep blue, and with this, a great variety
both of useful and ornamental pieces of china and glass were
coloured; which clearly shewed that the cobalt found in the
mines of Alva, was in no respect inferior in quality to that
procured from the mines in Saxony.  In consequence of this
discovery, the appearances of cobalt being now fully known,
very considerable quantities of it were discovered among the
heaps of rubbish, that had been taken out of the mines, at
the time when they were worked by the late Sir John Erskine.
This had remained undisturbed, for about fifty years; when
Lord Alva caused a great part of it to be washed, after the
manner practised by miners; and obtained an additional
quantity to that which had been already procured from the
level.  The work was carried on a great length from the
place where the mass of cobalt had been found; but spar and
other vein-stuff appearing, the further working of the mines
in this place was totally abandoned.
   During the time that these works were carried on, avery ac-
curate survey of all the different veins of metals that had been
discovered in the hills of this parish, was made by the agent
for the company, who possessed a very considerable degree of
skill in the practical part of mining.  The several appearances
and specimens of the different ores, which were found in con-
sequence of the trials which were made in the veins; together
with the precise direction which these take into the hills, with
a variety of circumstances relating to them, which it would
be improper to enumerate here, were all accurately taken down
by their agent, in a register or journal, and which is in the
possession of Mr Johnstone, the present proprietor of this ba-
