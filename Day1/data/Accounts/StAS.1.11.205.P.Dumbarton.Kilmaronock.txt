dent, and 22 non-resident.  The valued rent is 3329 L. 16 s. 6 d.
Scotch:  The real rent cannot be easily ascertained, as a great
part of the lands are in the hands of the proprietors.

   Church and Schools.-The church has much the appear-
ance of antiquity.  The manse was built in 1751, and since
that time it has been enlarged and repaired.  The stipend, by
a late augmentation, besides the glebe, is 6 chalders of meal,
1 chalder of bear, and 40 L. 5 s. Sterling in money including
communion elements.  Lord Stonefield is patron.-The pa-
rochial schoolmaster has 100 merks salary.  The number of
scholars is usually about 40.  His living is only about 15 L.
per annum.  Besides the parochial school, there are generally
other two.  The schoolmaster of one of them has 50 merks
salary, besides school fees.  If some suitable encouragement
is not soon given to schoolmasters, it is apprehended, that,
in many places, the education of children will be totally
neglected.

   Prices of Labour, Fuel etc.-The wages of a good plough-
man, for the year, besides board and lodging, are from 8 L. to
12 L. Sterling.  Those of a woman servant, for the year, be-
sides board, are from 3 L. to 4 L. Sterling.  The prices of pro-
visions are nearly the same with the Glasgow and Dumbarton
markets.-Peats are the common fuel.  Coals are brought
from Kilpatrick, a distance of 12 or 14 miles.

   Roads.-The military road from Stirling to Dumbarton,
after crossing the Endrick, by an excellent modern bridge,
passes, from E.  to W., through the parish.  There is also an
excellent turnpike road, which is now nearly completed, lead-
ing from this place by Ealler Kilpatrick to Glasgow.
