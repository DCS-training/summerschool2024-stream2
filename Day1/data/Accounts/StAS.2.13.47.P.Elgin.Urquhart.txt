Earl of Fife; and, under a trust-deed executed by that Earl, has,

                       III.-POPULATION.
  For nearly a century previous to 1755, the annual average of
baptisms recorded in the session register was double what it has
been in the last seven years, and hence the parish must have been
then considerably more populous than it is at present; but proba-
bly not so much more so, as the greater number of births would
indicate, a greater number of children having died then, than die
now, owing to the small-pox and other diseases not being now pre-
valent, or having ceased to be fatal, except in a few instances.

  Character of the People.-The people are shrewd, intelligent,
industrious and well-behaved. They have all of them been taught
to read and write; and though they cannot talk fluently on religi-
ous subjects, they seem sensible of their obligations to live in the
fear of God and in the practice of Christian duties. Their attend-
ance on the public ordinances of religion is upon the whole regular.
