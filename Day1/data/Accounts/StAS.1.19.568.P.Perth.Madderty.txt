is also supplied with 4 blacksmiths, 4 wrights, 2 shoemakers,
2 tailors, and 1 miller.

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-These here are equally
high with any place in the neighbourhood.  A day-labour-
er receives 1 s. 4 d. and sometimes 1 s. 6 d. a-day during
summer, and a shilling in winter; a ploughman's wages are
from L. 8 to L. 10 Sterling a-year.-The price of provisions
the same as in the town of Perth, and frequently conside-
rably higher, as the best prices are often charged for articles
of a very inferior quality.  No ale nor whisky sold public-
ly in the parish.  Coal is the fuel mostly used by the inha-
bitants.  It is mostly brought from Blairingone, in the pa-
rish of Foffaway, at the distance of about 24 miles.  They
are also had from the shipping at Perth, at the distance of
12 miles, but the price is higher than at Blairingone.  Far-
mers here, and in most of the neighbourhood, set a higher
value on a little money than on their own time and labour.
This must always be the case where there is no manufac-
ture, and farming and husbandry are not carried on with
proper vigour.

   Roads.-The parochial roads, for there is no turnpike in
the parish, are extremely bad, being hardly passable in wet
weather.  The communication on both sides the Pow is,
however, kept up, by means of three bridges of stone thrown
across that rivulet.

   Proper Names.-The names of places in this parish are
partly Gaelic, and partly English.  To the former belong
Tillychiandie, Bellycloine, Dallarie, Ardbennie, Balgowan:
But Redhill, Woodend, Dubhead, &c. belong to the
latter.
