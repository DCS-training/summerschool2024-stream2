has been, by some, called the Montpelier of Scotland.  It has
been frequented a good deal of late, in the summer months,
by many persons and families, for the sake of health or amu-
sement; and it would be still more, if there were better accom-
modation.-From Kelly bridge, the parish runs nine miles
south, along the shore, to Fairly, where it borders with the
parish of Kilbryde.  It may be very properly called, in gene-
ral, a stripe of land, between the mountains and the sea; and

   Soil, Produce, Etc-The soil, upon the whole, is rather

which are all green, afford excellent pasture for cattle.-
There is a practice also, which renders it impossible to have

the labour among them is over, they are returned home, often
in a poor state, to go through the work of their own ill-judg-

money, is the excuse made for this strange practice.-The
soil is light, the harvests are as early, and even earlier than
any in the neighbourhood.  The plough is certainly rather ne-
glected; but there is plenty of butter made, and many black
cattle and sheep sattened.

     Population.-In 1755, there was none who could properly
