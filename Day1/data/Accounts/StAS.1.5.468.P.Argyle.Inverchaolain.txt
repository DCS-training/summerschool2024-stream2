the pound); white, from 7 s. to 8 s.  The Society for ex-
tending Fisheries and Improvements, have been the means
of improving the sheep of this country considerably, by
the premiums, which they have been in the use of giving, 
of L. 14 Sterling, to the person who grazed the three best
parcels of tups, 6 to each parcel.-This has raised an e-
mulation among the graziers; and as the flock of the per-
son, who gets the premiums, is esteemed the best, he con-
sequently obtains a higher price for his sheep, in addition
to his premium.  The judges, appointed to determine the
qualities of the tups, presented for a competition, are at a
loss, whether to give it in favour of those whose wool is 
of the best quality, or in favour of the strongest and best
made rams, not knowing which of these points the Society
have principally in view; but they generally determine, 
in favour of those of the greatest strength and beauty, in
preference to those who have a greater quantity of wool,
or of superiority in quality, but an inferior shape or carcase.
Besides the braxy, (a disease common to sheep of the first
year, or hogs, as they are commonly called), by which
nearly a fourth are cut off, there is another disease fatal
to sheep of all ages, during the summer months, called the
sturdy, or dizziness in the head.  The symptoms of this dis-
ease are watery tumours in the fore of back part of the
head; and the only cure, that has been tried, is cutting a-
way these tumours, by which sometimes the animal's life
is preserved; though many die immediately after the o-
peration is performed.  The cause of this disease has never
been ascertained, nor any preventative discovered.

   Black Cattle and Horses.-The rage for sheep stocks has
banished the practice of rearing many black cattle; though
some judicious farmers think, a few on the hills, in sum-
mer, along with the sheep, would pasture on those grasses
