ides the yarn spun on the manufacturers account, a consi-
derable quantity is regularly bought in from the neighbour-
hood; and frequently from Montrose, Brechin, Cupar-An-
gus, etc.  Of the whole linen yarn manufactured, about a
seventh part is spun from flax produced in the country; and
the rest from flax imported, chiefly from Riga, at the average
price of L. 45, per ton.  For some years a considerable
quantity of yarn has bern brought into this port from Bremen
and Hamburgh.  The quantity has in one year amounted to
441,400 lbs; which at 3 lbs. to the spindle, made 147,133
spindles.  Of this, however, but a small proportion is com-
monly used in the parish; and no great proportion in the
neighbourhood.  The far greater part of it is sent to
Perth, Dunsermling, Falkland, Auchtermuchty, and some
other inland towns, in which coarse linen is manufac-
tured.
   Of the yarn used in making checks and ticks, about three-
fourths are whitened, and the remaining fourth dyed.  Most
of the principal manufacturers whiten and dye for themselves;
the rest employ public bleachers and dyers.  The different
operations of heckling, spinning, dyeing, bleaching, warping,
winding, and weaving, may be computed to employ 5 1/2 hands
to every loom; which makes the whole hands employed in
carrying on the manufacture of the place; reckoning men,
women, and children, 4455.  Deducing the price of mate-
rials, (flax, cotton, soap, ashes, indigo, etc.) which, when
those of the best quality are used, will be about one third of
the value of the cloth, there remains L. 30,000 as the price
of labour and the manufacturers profit.  And this being di-
vided among the whole number of productive hands, each is
found to produce annually, to the community about L. 7 Ster-
ling.
