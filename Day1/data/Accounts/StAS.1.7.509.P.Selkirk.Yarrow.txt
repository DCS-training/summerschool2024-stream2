There are 57 persons upon the poor's roll at this time.  None
of them are permitted to stroll and molest other parishes.
They are liberally supported at their own homes.  Every
person's case is duly considered twice in the year, and a sum
is allotted to them suitable to their exigency.  Besides the
weekly collections on Sundays the funds appropriated for
their maintenance are the assessments upon the heritors and

trouble, squander away what they earns and are at no pains
to secure for themselves a subsistence, either when laid upon
a bed of sickness, or subjected to the infirmities of old age.
