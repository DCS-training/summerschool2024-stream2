without the hope of a more comfortable mode of travelling
As we have hitherto had no roads, it is not to be
that we should have had bridges.  The two rivera, Liddal
and Hermitage, divide the parish for about 26 miles; there
never was a bridge on either of them.  From a consider-
able sum of vacant stipend, with, the assistance of the ordi-
nary fund, one was built over the river Hermitage in
1792; and last autumn another was completed over the
Liddal.  These, together with that part of the road alrea-
dy made, are of the greatest service to the country, and to
many travellers, who begin to pass this way from Carlisle
to the northern markets, and to Berwick-shire, the road
being much nearer than by Langholm and Moss-Paul.

   Fuel.-The fuel chiefly used is peat, of which there
an inexhaustible fund in every part of the country.  There
is also coal in the lower part of the parish, wrought on the
estate of My Oliver.  It is sold at the pit at 3 d. per bushel,
or 6 d. per load.  Carriers, who bring goods from Hawick,
commonly return loaded with coal.

   New Castletown.-As there is, not a village in the parish,
labourers and mechanics have long been very inconve-
niently situated for houses.  For their accommodation, and
no doubt to encourage manufactures, the Duke of Buc-
cleugh, has for some time past, intended to build a new
town.  At length a place was fixed on, and a plan made
out.  It is set down on the farm of Park, on the banks of
the Liddal, in a field of upwards of 100 acres of fine land,
and is named Castletown.  It is to consist of two principal
streets, bearing the names of the two rivers, Liddal and
Hermitage, with several cross streets at right angles.  Her-
mitage-street is begun, and advancing rapidly.  There is a
square, called Douglas Square, in the centre, for a market.
