   The fall of the Esks is here, to a considerable extent, made
available as a mechanical power in different corn mills, in a woollen
manufactory, and in raising water for the supply of the town of
Dalkeith. Were reservoirs, however, formed among the bills from
which these streams flow, by which a constant supply of water
might be obtained during every season of the year, the efficiency
of the Esks, in reference to mechanical power, would be very
much increased, and rendered much more valuable. The North
Esk, rising in the Pentlands at an altitude of more than 1100 feet
above the level of the sea, and with a course of nearly nineteen
miles in length, has a fall of about 100 feet per mile from its
sources to Carlops; and from this to Dalkeith, nearly 60 feet per
mile; and from Dalkeith to the sea, 23 feet per mile.
   The various chemical agents employed at present in different
manufactories on the Esks may have in some degree injured the
pastime of angling; but though they may thus compel the disciples
of Walton to extend their walks to the purer stream of the Gala,
they have otherwise added to the wealth and prosperity of the
country.
   Meteorology.-From the observations already made in regard to
atmospheric influence on vegetable and animal life, the climate of
Dalkeith might be pretty justly inferred. The temperature of the
springs already stated, which was 48\d Fahrenheit, may be consi-
dered, not only as the mean temperature of the bed of the Esk
at Dalkeith, but also of all those places having the same elevation
above the level of the sea, as Smeaton. The barometer and ther-
mometer from which the following meteorological table is construct-
ed are placed 95 feet above the level of these springs, and 190 feet
above the mean level of the sea, while the rain-gauge is stationed
only a few feet lower in the adjoining garden.
   In the absence of a series of observations for a period of years,
it may not be uninteresting to compare the following table for 12
months with some observations made in this neighbourhood about
160 years ago by Sinclair, who was Professor of Natural Philosophy
in the University of Glasgow, and one of the first in this country,
to repeat the experiments of Pascal, to ascertain by the barometer
the relative height of mountains, and to register its varying column
in connection with atmospheric changes for indicating the weather,
and for the purposes of navigation, in the form of the marine ba-
rometer. In December 1669, Sinclair observed the highest alti-
tude of the barometer, or horoscope as be names it, to be 29.9
