the country would certainly be great.  It is a pity but that
the gentlemen of the Merse and Teviotdale would take the
hint.  They are by no means defective in public spirit Un-
less such an undertaking be supported by the landed inter-
est, there would be little hope of success.  A private indivi-
dual, fearful of the event, will not be willing to launch into
such a work;-and few, if they had spirit, have the means
requisite to carry it on with advantage.  Such a plan, pro-
perly executed, would facilitate very sensibly the rise of the
value of land in this district.  It would at the same time
obviate a complaint, perhaps justly made by the farmers,
that though the wool brings a good price, yet they receive
not its full values because there is no competition, but what
arises from different persons carrying wool to the same
market, who can combine together and regulate the price.
By a manufactory so near too, the farmers might easily
come to acquire the art of sorting the wool properly, which
might turn considerably to their emolument.
   A plan of this kind will not sail, it is to be hoped, to re-
ceive assistance, should the proposed canal take place be-
tween Kelso and Berwick: a work which would also re-
dound to the great benefit of the country, should it be on-
ly to rouse a spirit of enterprise in the nation.  But other
obvious advantages are not wanting.  The practicability of
carrying the canal up the Teviot, as far as Ancrum bridge,
is not disputed, perhaps it may be carried much higher up
the river.  Corn, which is railed in far greater quantities
than is wanted for the supply of home consumption, by these
means, would easily be conveyed to Berwick, where there is
often a considerable demand for it, and which cannot be sent
but at great expence, the distance between Berwick and An-
crum bridge being 30 miles.  Coal and lime (articles of the
greatest importance of all) could be brought at a reason-
