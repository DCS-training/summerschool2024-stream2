appears to have been great anxiety to wait upon religious ordinan-
ces. Thus, June 6tb 1647, it is noticed, " that the kirk was too
little to contain the people of the parish; " and that " hundreds
were constrained to ly in the kirkyard in time of sermon, about
the doors and windows." An application was in consequence
made to the heritors, who enlarged the church accommodation by
building an aisle. After the occupation of Scotland by Cromwell,
the record exhibits complaints of " disorder," occasioned " by the
troubles of the time;" of disorder " by Englishmen," and " by
English souldiers." And, October 16th 1653, the minister re-
ports to the session, that there were in the parish "ignorant per-
sons, scandalous livers, persons who had not attended diets of ex-
amination, and those who did not profess to keep family worship,
in all near to 200 persons."
   As illustrative of the spirit of our fathers about this period, the
following public collections may be noticed, which were made in
the parish between the years 1631 and 1658 :

   Under the Episcopal usurpation, during the reigns of Charles
II. and James VII., tbo discipline appears to have been maintain-
ed with considerable strictness. None of the festivals or saints'
days seem to have been observed; and the communion was dis-
pensed on a Sabbath, and sometimes on two successive Sabbaths,
by appointment of the session. The first Presbyterian minister
after the Revolution, Mr Allan Logan, was ordained July 24,
1695. His session consisted of thirteen elders; and discipline
continued to be exercised with a very searching strictness. Dur-
ing his incumbency, till he was translated to Culross, in 1717,
Many curious notices are to be found in the record. Under this
head we may notice an oath of purgation, administered, in 1703,
to one Curry, who had been accused of adultery; the appearance
