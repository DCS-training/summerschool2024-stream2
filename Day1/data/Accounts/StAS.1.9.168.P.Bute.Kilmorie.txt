     Statistical Account

night from those on the Mulls of Kintyre, Galloway, and
Cumbray.

   Fish.-The sea-coast abounds with fish of different kinds,
such as herring, salmon, scate, cod, ling, lythe, flounder,
haddock, whiting, etc. but the inhabitants have not ac-
quired the art of being very beneficial to themselves in
fishing any of these but herring.  There is also in these
seas a hugh fish, called Sail-fish, which is caught by sticking
them with sharp-edged instruments, of the harpoon kind;
they are productive of good quantities of oil; but the
fishermen must be dexterous when about to stick the fish,
as the attempt is sometimes dangerous.

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor.-In this parish are two
places of worship, exclusive of that occupied by the cate-
chut in the north-end of the island.  The principal paro-
chial kirk is at Kilmory, in the south end of the island, re-
built in 1785, with Gothic windows, and 1 gallery.  The
other place, called Shitken, is 6 computed miles westward.
The Duke of Hamilton is patron, and sole proprietor, ex-
cepting two farms.  The stipend is L. 70, exclusive of a
manse and glebe.-There are two parochial schools.  The
salary allowed to the principal is L. 50 Scots, the half of
which is paid by the Duke of Hamilton, and the other by
the tenants of the district.  To the other school is allowed
L. 40 Scots, paid also in halves, as aforesaid.  The parish
is divided into 2 parochial districts; each of the school-
masters has in his own district, 1 s. for marriage, 6 d. for
baptism, and L. 6 Scots each for session-clerkship; then
number of scholars may be 50 each, more or less; but
there are also many petty schools.  The wages are invari-
ably 1 s. the quarter for reading, 1 s. 6 d. for writing, and
2 s. 6 d. for arithmetic.
