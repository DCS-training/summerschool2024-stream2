the tenants are bound to dig, to dry, and to fetch home and
build up, as much peat as is necessary for the proprietor's fu-
el through the year.  In this manner the tenants are em-
ployed during most part of the summer.  It prevents them
from fallowing and cleaning their grounds, fetching manures
from a distance, sowing turnip, etc.  On other estates, it is
the duty of the tenants to carry out and spread the dung for
manuring the proprietor's land in the feed time, which fre-
quently interferes with his own work of the same kind.  It
is also the duty od the tenants to fetch from the neighbour-
ing sea-ports all the coal wanted for the proprietor's use.  The
tenants are also bound to go a certain number of errands,
sometimes with thier carts and horses, and sometimes a-foot,
a certain number of long errands, and a certain number of
short ones, are required to be performed.  A long errand
is what requires more than one day.  This is called carriage.
Tenants are also expected to work at any of the proprietor's
work a certain number of days in the year.  In some places,
this obligation, it is said extends to 52 days, or a day in the 
week.

down the proprietor's corn.  This duty he must perform
when called on.  It sometimes happens, that, by cutting 
down the proprietor's crop, he loses the opportunity of cut-
ting down his own.

   This whole catalogue of customs is to adverse to agricul-
ture, and to the true interests of the proprietor, that, in a
short time, their very names will probably be obsolete and 
the nature of them forgotten.
