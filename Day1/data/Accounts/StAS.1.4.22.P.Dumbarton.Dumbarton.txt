diseases are to be attributed to ill-aired and crowded low
houses, and to an over anxiety for constant prayers over
the diseased.

   Rivers and fish.-The Leven is navigable by coasting ves-
sels above the town of Dunbarton; so far up the tides rise.
Salmon and trout are taken in large quantities.  The former
frequently sells so high as 1 s 6 d. per l b. tron, on the spot,
seldom falls below 6 d, and never below 4 d.  Through the
whole spring season, the Leven salmon is excellent, but the
Clyde is not fished before Whitsunday.  Trout generally
sells at 4 d. per pound.  Very large eels, and a large spe-

A species of sea animals, most destructive of the sal-

times two miles higher, but generally keep lower down.
These are called buckers, pellocks, or porpoises.  The sal-
mon fishery employs 16 men.

   Population.-According to the returns made from hence
to Dr Webster about 1750, this parish then contained 1427
souls.  In 1790, the number of examinable persons above
six years of age was found to amount to about 2000
(103 above 70 years of age, and two near 100,) of whom
1850 resided in the town of Dunbarton, and 153 in the 
country part of the parish.  In that year 86 were baptised,
58 were buried, and 30 couples married.  From the regi-
sters, it appears, that in 1644, 44 died; in 1654, 33, in
1664, 42:  In 1690, 73 were baptised, 50 died, and 12
couples were married.  The increase of population is to be
attributed to the establishment of glass-works in the town,
and of printfields in the neighbourhood.  Almost the whole
