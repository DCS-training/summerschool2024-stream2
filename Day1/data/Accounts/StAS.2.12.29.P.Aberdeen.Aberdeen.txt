master of the Grammar School, was summoned before the magis-
trates for contempt of the Church of Rome.  He answered bold-
ly that he did not consider himself amenable to the court of Rome.
But two years afterwards he expressed his contrition, which, as
Mr Kennedy observes, "probably saved him from the dreadful
punishment which generally awaited the enemies of that church."
In 1525, the principles of the Reformation had made such pro-
gress in Aberdeen, that the King sent orders to the Sheriff to
search for and punish those who had in their possession heretical
books, it being alleged that several strangers and others within the
diocese of Aberdeen were busied in propagating the errors of
Luther.
   Ultimately, however, the truth prevailed, and the following ex-
tract from the council records, of date 4th October 1560, shews

gation, and the time of his dmission to the office seems to be near-
ly fixed by tbe following entry in the council records of the same
date with the preceding: "The counsell ordains the thesaurer to
pay Adam Heriot, minister of the towne, the soume of twa hun-

   In January 1561-2, the silver and brass, work belonging to the
church, which had in the meantime been entrusted to the care of
a member of the council, was sold by public roup for the common
