<FOOTNOTE>There have existed in Alloa a few readers of the writings of the New Jerusalem
church for about forty years. About the year 1798, Messrs Wright and Hands, members
of it from London, at Airthrey, Dear Stirling, for the purpose of working a
mine of copper ore, for the reducing which to a metallic they had an establish.
ment in Alloa. After two or three years trial, owing to the mines not yielding a suf-
ficient quantity of pure metal to cover the expense of working it, Messrs Wright and
Hands gave up the undertaking. On leaving Alloa, they presented the readers witb
a few New-Church works, which formed the commencement of their present library.
