   The tradesmen do not fully supply the parish with the
commodities in which they deal.  The weavers, however,
besides the linen and coarse woollen stuffs they made for
the inhabitants, began, a few years ago, to be much employ-
ed in working scrims, a thin narrow linen for the Glasgow
market.  This manufacture ceased all at once, on the com-
mencement of the war January 1793; and as suddenly re-
vived, about June 1794, on the capture of some of the French
West India islands, and the speculation thereby excited a-

   Farmers, Agriculture.-Of the farmers, three have sheep
farms: The largest of these contains 1300 acres, feeds 600
sheep, and yields 75 L. of yearly rent.  The sheep are of the
black faced Linton breed, and of small size; their sleeces
do not exceed two pounds weight each, and sell from 8 s.
to 13 s. a stone.  A ewe and lamb may bring 7 s. 6 d, and
a sheep at Michaelmas, 6 s. 6 d.
   Those in the preceding article stiled small farmers, are such
as cannot yoke a plough without the aid of their neighbours,
and generally pay under 8 L. each for their possessions, which
rarely exceed 8 or 10 acres.  They are commonly either
tradesmens, or work with a horse, in buying and carrying
meal, yarn and other commodities.  Most of the other ten-
ants or farmers pay from 15 L. to 30 L.; eleven from 50 l. to
175 L., and one 300 L. of yearly rent.  Those who pay the
largest rents, give almost universally more for an acre than
those who pay smaller sums.  The rents per acre vary from
1 l. 5 s. and upwards, to 15 s. 13 s. 10 s. and 7 s.  Yet
the mere circumstance of enlarging the farms is far from
being the role cause of their paying more rent by the acre

brought into the best state of cultivation, and have also ge-
