      It is supposed that about two-thirds of the parish are in arable
     land and good natural pasture, and the other third waste and co-
     vered with heath.
       For at least thirty or forty years past, there has been an incli-
     nation in'every farmer who had the opportunity, to reclaim land
     from the waste. Before that period, it was considered as imprac-
     ticable; but the example of a few individuals who bad the forti-
     tude to depart from established custom, showed that the innova-
     tion not only was safe, but might even be attempted with advan-
     tage. In all probability, after a few years, there will be no waste.
     ground in the parish ; and in the course of time, every acre may
     be brought into a state of garden cultivation.
        There are two modes of reclaiming the waste,--First, about or
     after Martinmas, when the ground is socked with rain, it is plough-
     ed and exposed to the frosts of winter, and the beat of the suc-
     ceeding summer. In spring of the next year, ware, dung, or other
     manure is laid on; the ground is broken and made smooth with
     the harrow and roller; and in the last place, cross-ploughed and
     sown with oats. In the second plan, or lazy bed, the ground, after
     being spread with horse or cow dung, is planted with Potatoes.
     The lazy bed now mentioned is perhaps the most effectual way of
     bringing waste ground to a state of cultivation; for in the season
     succeeding the crop of potatoes, oats or bear may be sown with
     or without manure, as suits the convenience of the farmer.
       I shall now describe the rural policy of the parish ; and the de-
     scription will, in general, apply to the whole island of Sanday, or
