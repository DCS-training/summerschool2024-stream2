mate to combat.  The ground is prepared, either with the
plough or crooked spade, a clumsy hand implement, point-
ed with a piece of iron four or five inches diameter, which,
though ludicrous to the eye of a stranger, is absolutely ne-
cessary in shallow stoney ground, where it is impossible for
the plough to move, or for the hand spade to be used; yet
it must be acknowledged, that it is often employed without
necessity.  Oats, potatoes, and barley, are the crops of the
parish; which, as soon after the middle of March as the
ground is properly dried up from the winter storms, are sown
in regular succession, with as little interruption as the wea-
ther permits.  Small oats are much, if not principally fade,
a hardy grain, which, though neither so fruitful nor to nou-
rishing as the large, is found to be best adapted to the feve-
rities of the climate.  The early oats have been tried, but
abandoned, as precarious and uncertain.  Potatoes are much
cultivated, and serve as a subsitute for bread among the
lower class of people, nearly for two thirds of the whole
year.  In a rainy climate, early crops are not to be expected;
yet this parish, notwithstanding its local disadvantages, is re-
markable for an early harvest. The harvest 1782 and 1783,
were singular over all Scotland.  The barley was then cut
in October, and the oats not got in the end of Novem-
ber; yet these were years of plenty; the general scarcity did
not affect this parish, whose crop would bear a comparison
with any year's since that period.  But it is to be observed,
that this is not a corn, but a grasing country, whose crops
rarely supply the parish with meal, a considerable quantity of
surface being waste and useless.

farmer principally derives his emolument, and the landlord
his rent.  There are generally about 3000 black cattle,
