   Stipend and Poor's Funds.-The church was built in 1764,
and the manse in 1778.  The stipend was lately augmented to
L. 61 sterling in money, 34 bolls of meal, and 16 bolls of bear.
The glebe contains 12 acres, much improved by the present
incumbent.  Francis Garden of Dalgety, is patron.
   The poor of the parish fluctuates in number.  At present 30
persons claim a supply, and, according to their respective ne-
cessities, receive from 10 s. to 40 s. each, per annum.  This
small supply, in conjunction with their own industry, and the
charity of neighbours, affords the sober support of life.  A
poor man, with a numerous family, often receives a present;
and the dead of the indigent are buried at the public expence.
The stock of the poor, exclusive of L. 11 mortified for a parti-
cular purpose, amounts to L. 120.  Some time ago, the an-
nual collections produced L. 12, but now produce L. 30 a year.
During last century, the annual collections seldom amounted
to, and never exceeded, L. 3: 10 sterling.

   Progress of improvement.-The parish can boast but of few
persons distinguished for learning, but many eminent for
valuable qualifications have been produced here, at the head
of whom stands Joseph Cumine, late of Auchry.  Nature had
endowed Mr Cumine with an active and vigorous mind.  Cool,
sagacious, penetrating, he connected a sound judgement and

band, by the sale of cattle, and by his work, to furnish bread, During the
infancy and childhood of their family, parents of these classes are generally
poor, but gradually rise to easy circumstances, as their children become capa-
ble of relieving the hand, and assissting in the industry of the mother.  By old
age, or the contingencies of life, some are obliged to appeal to the gratitude
of their children, or to the charity of the public.  But it reflects honour on
the genius of the people, that nothing but the hard hand of necessity can ob-
lige them to adopt this last expedient.
