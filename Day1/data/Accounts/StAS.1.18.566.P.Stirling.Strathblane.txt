rally adopted.  The quantity laid on at once is but small,
being 4 chalders per acre; but this is repeated with equal ad-
vantage, after two rotations of crops, or every 12 th year.
This fact has been ascertained by undoubted experiment.
The crops generally raised, are oats, barley, and grass-seeds.
The usual rotation, is 2 years pasture, 2 crops of oats, 2
of hay, and then pasture again.  The lime is spread upon
the pasture grass, a year previous to ploughing it up for oats.
This gives it time to incorporate with the mould, and both
improves the grass, and meliorates the soil for a future crop,
to a higher degree than when laid on in the same year in
which the ground is ploughed.  The grass seeds are sown
with the second crop of oats, in the quantity of half a boll of
rye-grass seed, and from 4 to 6 pounds of clover seed to an
acre.  This course of cropping is uniformly adhered to, and
is only varied, in as far as barley is partially introduced for the
second crop of oats.  As far as this can be done, it is cer-
tainly an improvement on the plan; but as barley only suc-
ceeds when the ground is well dunged, the sowing of it can-
not be extended any farther than the quantity of that manure
collected in the course of the year will admit.
   This method of croping may be thought too severe, espe-
cially the second crop of hay, which is very impoverishing.
But as this article brings a good price, being usually sold at
6 d per stone, the farmer depends a good deal upon it for his
rent; and it yields ready money the second year, without any
expence of seed or labour; an object worthy of being attend-

   Of late years, however, the farmer's hopes have in a great
measure been frustrated in this respect, by the inattention of
the seed merchants, who have supplied them with rye-grass
seed, which remains only one year in the ground.  The first
appearance of this annual seed, caused a good deal of alarm
