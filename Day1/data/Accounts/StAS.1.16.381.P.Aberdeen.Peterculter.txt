France in the 8th century.  They entered the Seine and
the Loire in their boats, and plundered the country to the
gates of Paris.  At length the French were forced to re-
sign Normandy and Britany to Rollo, their general, anno
876.  After that, they were frequently called Normans.
Norman, too, was sometimes the name of their generals or
chiefs.  About the same time, they harassed the coasts of
Britain, and continued their invasions to the 11th century.
In some of their latest descents, it is likely that they had
penetrated into this country, and formed the encampment
which I have mentioned.  Considering the nature of the
country, the position was well chosen.  Few places, so
near the public road, and of so great extent could be so
easily fortified, or take in so distinct and so wide a pro-

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Farmers and crofters,
and cottagers, are near to a good market, for what they
have to sell; but persons who need to buy, pay as high a
price for poultry, eggs, milk, etc. as is paid at the market-
cross of Aberdeen.  The price of labour is generally the
same here and in town.  It is an advantage to be near to

farms.  It may soon be found an advantage to all classes,
if coals shall become their general firing; and that period
does not seem to be very distant.  If people could be re-
conciled to the use of coals, and were accustomed to the
proper management of them, they would find them cheap-
er firing now than peat and turf; and although plantations
