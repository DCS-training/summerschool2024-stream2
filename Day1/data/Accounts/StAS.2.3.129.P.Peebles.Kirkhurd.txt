   Antiquities.-Several stones of a circular form are standing in
the neibourhood of old Harestanes, supposed to have been erect-
ed by the Druids for religious purposes.
   Near Castlecraig house are two mounts called the Castle and
the Law, supposed to have been sepulchral barrows of ancient
construction, though afterwards used as stations for the admini-
stration of justice to a rude people. To the cast of these is a
circular fortification, on an eminence near Ladyurd, called the
Rings, and another to the west called the erections. They are
supposed to have been military erections.
   At Mount-bill, about the year 1754, a stone chest enclosing a
large clay urn containing human bones was found. And more re-
cently there was found at the bottom of the same hill a stone cof-
fin 4 1/2 feet long, 2 1/2 feet wide, and 2 1/2 feet deep, which contained
human bones, among which were discovered three flint stones,-
one resembling a halbert; another of a circular form; and the third
of a cylindrical form, with a small ring, supposed to have been a
Druidical amulet. In another part of the parish, there was also
found a few years ago another stone coffin, formed of a great many
stones rudely put together, and containing human bones.
   Modern Buildings.-Castlecraig, the seat of Sir Thomas G.
Carmichael, is an elegant and commodious mansion-house, erected
by Sir John G. Carmichael, and enlarged and beautified by the
present proprietor. The garden and pleasure grounds are very ex-
tensive, and tastefully laid out. The house at Cairnmuir, belong-
ing to John Lawson, Esq. is also in excellent one, and well fitted
for the accommodation of a large family.
