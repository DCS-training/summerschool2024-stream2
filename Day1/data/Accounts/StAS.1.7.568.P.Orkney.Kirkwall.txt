     Statistical Account

though the fishery be at present carried on by an opulent
company, it is confined to the south isles, whereas, were it
extended, as indeed it should be through the whole, twice
the number at least might be annually carried to the Lon-
don market.  There are plenty of them to be found every
where around the islands; and though they be sold at the
low price of a penny, or a penny farthing each, where they
are caught, they are said to bring into the country about
800 L. annually.  A sum equal to this might, perhaps, be
received from the capture of herrings.  That most excellent
species of fish comes, it is well known, in several great shoals
from the frozen ocean in the north, and one of these in its
progress south, hovers about the northern isles, and the east
coast of Great Britain.  Vast multitudes of them are taken
on the coast of Shetland in the month of June; and in the
end of July, and first of August, they frequently touch at
Wick, and other places on the shores of Caithness and Su-
therland.  In the intermediate time and space, they might
certainly be got here in no small quantity, for the bays of
Orkney are, in the months of July and August, in some
seasons at least, full of them.  But the people here, are ei-
ther so destitute of spare hands, from their present mode
of agriculture, and from the number of people usefully em-
ployed in burning kelp through the summer, or they are so
void of enterprize, or perhaps of the means of this species of
industry, that though this fishery has an appearance, that
promises profits sufficient to reward those that would under-
take it, there is scarcely at present a herring net in the whole
country.  No small benefit, it is believed, might also be ob-
tained from a cod fishing.  Every where almost around this
country cod are to be found, when the weather permits
boats to get off to them, which indeed is but seldom the
case, as the banks which they usually haunt lie at a consi-
