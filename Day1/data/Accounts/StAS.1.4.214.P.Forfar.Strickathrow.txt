     Statistical Account

   Roads.-The great roads from Brechin to Aberdeen,
and from Brechin to Glenesk, pass through this parish, and
are in tolerable repair; but the road from hence to Mon-
trose, and the private roads, are a disgrace to the country.
In 1789, an act of Parliament was obtained to repair the
roads in this county, by which the statute-labour is con-
verted into money, at the rate of L. 1, 4 s. for every L. 100
Scots of valued rent.  The sense of the parishioners of
Strickathrow, with respect to this act is, that commuta-
tion of labour into money is an advantage both to them
and to the roads, provided the sum is moderate; but in 
the present instance it is deemed too high.

   Antiquities, and Miscellaneous, Observations.-There is a
place in the parish called Blackdikes, which is thought to
be a corruption of Battle-dikes.  This conjecture is strength-
ened by there being the remains of a camp of an oblong
figure, 2 sides of which are still visible, lying in the neigh-
bourhood, in the parish of Brechin.  N. W. from this en-
campment, at the distance of about 3 miles, are 2 bills,
forming a part of the Grampian Mountains, called Cater-
thun, or 'the East and West Cater,' the one surrounded
with an immense assemblage of stones, the other with an
earthen rampart, both being in a favourable situation for a
camp.  It is very strongly conjectured that this is the place
mentioned by Tacitus, where the engagement between A-
gricola and Galgacus, General of the Caledonians, hap-
pened.  Under this head, it may be mentioned that, ac-
cording to some writers, the church-yard of Strickathrow
was the scene of the abject surrender of the Crown of Scot-
land, by John Baliol, to King Edward I. in 1296.-Na-
ture has denied coal to this parish, and that want is more
sensibly felt by a tax of 2 s.  the boll upon importation.
