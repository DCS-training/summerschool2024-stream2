   As the present incumbent has not been long in the parish
of Jura, and as he has not been able to procure former exa-
mination rolls, it is out of his power to give a statement of
the population prior to the date of his own survey.  Emigra-
tions to America have proved, once and again, a drain to this
island; but, in the present mode of management, it may be
said to be still overstocked with inhabitants.  Near half the
farms in the island are in pasture, and require very few hands
to manage them.  Of course, the great body of the people
live in the farms, which are in tillage.  In some of these there
are between 50 and 60 souls.  Such a swarm of inhabitants,
where manufactures, and many other branches of industry are
unknown, are a very great load upon the proprietors, and in
a great measure useless to the state.  The slightest survey of
the situation of the people shows how much improvements in
farming, and the introduction of industry, are wanted.  The
spirit of emigration is still powerful in the island, and requires
considerable alterations to extinguish it*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As there was no register of births and marriages in the parish till
within these few years, the author found it impracticable to trace back the
matter so far as might be wished; but has gone as far back as the commence-
ment of the parish records.
