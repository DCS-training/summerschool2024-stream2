   Eminent Persons.-This parish has given birth to a famous
military character, Colonel William Russell of Ashysteel,
whose heroic exploits in India reflect honour upon himself,
and do credit to his country.  One, in particular, deserves
to be recorded, as it displays the most undaunted spirit, and
the most intrepid valour.  When Manilla, the capital of the
Phillippine Isles, was stormed by the naval and military forces

In preference to all other candidates, she gave her hand to
Scott of Harden.  From this marriage there sprung a daugh-

Stobbs, commonly called "Gibby with the golden garters."
From them are descended the present Sir William Elliot of
Stobbs and Lord Heathfield.  A circumstance relating to
their marriage-contract merits a place in historic records, as
it strongly marks the predatory spirit of the times.  Finding
it inconvenient to take home his wife, Gibby besought his
father-in-law to lodge her for some time.  With this request
he complied, upon condition that he was to receive, for her
hoard, the plunder of the first harvest moon.  A most fin-
