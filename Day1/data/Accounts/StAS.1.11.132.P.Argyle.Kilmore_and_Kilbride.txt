   Manufactures.-Of late a small branch of the cotton ma-
nufacture was introduced into this quarter, by Mr. DAVID
DALE of Glasgow; but its progress has hitherto been greatly
retarded by the dearth of fuel.  That cause being now re-
moved, other gentlemen of enterprise and public spirit have it
in contemplation, to establish works of the same kind.

   VILLAGE of OBAN.-This village is situated on the N. W.
side of the parish, and covered from the Western Ocean by the
Island of KERRERA.  It has two entries, one from the S., and
one from the N.  The first house of any consequence in Oban
was built about 80 years ago, by a trading company of Ren-
srew.  They used the house as a store-room; Oban being
considered, even then, as one of the most convenient situations
