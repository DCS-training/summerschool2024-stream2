     Statistical Account

   From the high price of materials and workmanship,
building is as dear here as in many other parts of the king-
dom.  The best houses, when rented, do not give above
3 per cent. of the cost in building; small houses give 5 or
6 per cent.  It may be thought that traders of small capi
tals might employ their money to more advantage than in
building houses which give such poor returns; neverthe-
less, those who can afford it, rather chuse to build, and oc-
cupy a house of their own, than pay the moderate rent of
such a house.  Small quays are raised to defend the houses
next the sea, and some houses are erected on foundations
built in the sea.

   Farm Stocking.-The number of horses in the following
list will appear great, when compared to the number of
acres cultivated, and the quantity of grain raised.  It is
the pride of the farmers to keep as many, and as good hor-
ses as they can afford, and therefore they give them a con-
siderable part of the oat-crop.  It is usual at a marriage,
when returning from church, to try who can ride foremost
to the wedding house, and they are as keen in the race, and
perhaps as much elated with the victory, as those of higher
rank are at Newmarket.
   The following is an exact list taken in July 1794, ex-
cept that the precise number of sheep and swine cannot be
ascertained:
