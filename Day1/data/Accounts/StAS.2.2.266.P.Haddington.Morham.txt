                 III.-POPULATION.
   The return to Dr Webster in 1755 is said in the former Statis-
tical Account to have stated the population at 345 souls. If the
number be rightly given, a decrease has since that time taken
place, which it is difficult to account for either by the junction of
farms, the larger use of machinery and consequent reduction of
hands employed in agriculture, or any other change to which a
small agricultural parish like this can have been subject. For in
1791 the population had sunk so low as 190, and at no time sub-
sequent has it exceeded 265. It is conceived that some material
error found its way into the return of 1755. And indeed another
authority * takes off just 100 from that return.
   The four last Returns to Government exhibit the following par-
ticulars:
1901. Families in the parish 53; males 137; females 117; total 254.
1811. Families 52; of these employed in agriculture 43; in trade, &c. 9. Males 113;
        females 106; total 219.
1821. Families 52; of these employed in agriculture 46, in trade, &c. 6. Males 121;
       females 120; total 241.

discharge," was formally made with the kirk-treasurer, when the money left in the
little box was transferred to the big box, and a note entered on the session a record Of
the whole monies on hand.
