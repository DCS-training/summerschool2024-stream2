zeing delivery, to pay for every boll 4 lib. of money."--(Register of
Contracts of the Commissariot of St Andrews.)--" He was alive
in March 1596, when he obtained decreet against John Richard-
son, for the few farme of the kirk-lands of Aberbrothock, assigned
to him by the Lords of Counsel, viz. 2 bolls wheat, 28 bolls bear,
and 20 bolls aitmeal." The stipend of Arbroath is stated by
Playfair in his Description of Scotland, to have amounted in 1755
to L. 71, 18s. 0 1/2d. In the Statistical Account of the parish, writ-
ten in 1792, it is said to have consisted of 6 b. of wheat; 22 b.,
2 f. 3 p. and 1. lip. of barley; 23 b. 2 f. and 2 p. of meal; and
L. 54, 8s. l0d., including the rent for the church-yard grass, but
not including L. 4, 3s. 4d. for communion elements, and L. 4, 8s. 11d.
for house-rent. It has since been augmented, and now consists of
wheat, 6 b.; meal, 69 b. 1 f. 3 p. and 1 1/2 lip.; and barley, 68 b.
2 f. and 2 1/2 lip.; besides L. 72, 15s.; a teind of fish yielding L. 6;
and L. 4, 8s. 11d. for house-rent.*
	There is also a permanent assistant minister in the parish, who
officiates as a colleague, and has the charge of one of the two dis-
tricts into which the parish is divided. His stipend arises partly
from the proceeds of an endowment of L. 790, the commencement
of which was a bequest of L. 565 by a Convener Mill in 1776.
The scanty income which this could afford was made up by the
people, at first to L. 50, and afterwards to L. 60 or L. 70. A large
portion of the emoluments of the session clerkship has since been
added, and the sum given by the people greatly increased; so that,
during the last year of the incumbency of the writer of this, the
proceeds amounted to L. 180.
	The patronage of the parish belonged formerly to the Earl of
Panmure, but was forfeited to the Crown in 1715. The patronage
of the office of assistant-minister of the parish is vested in the kirk-
session.
	The population of the parish having greatly increased, a chapel
of ease was erected in 1797, in the north-east corner of the abbey
grounds, under the name of the Abbey Chapel. It accommodates
1268 persons, allowing eighteen inches to each sitter. As in the
parish church, so here also the seats are private property. No
parochial district is assigned to the minister, which we regard as a
great evil. But he may dispense the ordinance of the Lord's
supper, and baptize the children of those parishioners who are

<FOOTNOTE> The allowance for communion elements is L. 8, 6s. 8d.; and the grass of the
church-yard yields annually L. 4, 10s.
