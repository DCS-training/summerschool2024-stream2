      Plantations.-- There are about 750 imperial acres under wood,
   nearly 300 of which have been planted within the last forty years.
   The trees most generally planted are the Scotch fir and larch,
   intermixed occasionally with a considerable proportion of beech,
   ash, oak, elm, plane, birch, alder, horse-chesnut, Spanish chesnut,
   lime, poplar, silver-fir, spruce-fir, service-tree, mountain-asb, la-
   burnum, holly, &c. &c.  Judging by the comparative growth, the
   particular species of trees do not, in every instance, especially in
   the earliest plantations, appear to have been placed in the soil
   most congenial to their growth.  The experience of the past,
   however, will, it is probable, prevent in future the occurrence of
   such mistakes as may have been committed in this respect.  As
   yet, it seems doubtful whether the soil generally is more conge-
   nial to the Scotch fir or to the larch.  It is plain, however, that
   there are many stations more favourable to the one than to the
   other, and not a few unfavourable to both, where, notwithstanding,
   spruce and silver fir, as also beech and oak, are of vigorous growth.
   In regard to Scotch firs,* the result of many experiments seems
   to have rendered it certain, that plants raised from seed collected
   from the natural forest, grow more vigorously, and produce timber
   of better quality than the common plants of the nursery.  The
   fine thriving firs immediately behind the house of Dunlugas were
   raised from plants of the former description, and by the accus-
   tomed eye might be distinguished as such, from the peculiar tinge
   of their foliage.  Upon the whole, with a few exceptions in the
   more elevated localities exposed to the blast of the north, the
   soil of the parish is well adapted to the growth of timber of various
   kinds; and if any opinion may be formed from the success of for-
   mer plantations, the soil, if judiciously selected, is congenial to a

     *	The Scotch fir of this part of the country is, properly speaking, the Canadian
   fir.  The true Scotch fir is more red in the colour, its bark has a cleaner and shining
   appearance, its boughs are more gnarled, its timber is reckoned of superior quality,
   and altogether its appearance is more majestic and picturesque.  It may be seen in
   perfection at Marr Lodge.
