   Of Dalkeith.

It is believed that the various reparations which it has un-
dergone, have cost as much as would have been sufficient to
build an excellent new house on a more desirable situation.
The stipend is 95 L.; but there is a prospect of its being soon
augmented, as the patron, with his usual public spirit, has
generously proposed it, though the whole burden of the aug-
mentation falls on himself.  The glebe is about 6 acres, all
arable, and from its vicinity to the village, is, on that ac-
count, the more valuable.-As the parish is populous, so the
poor are proportionably numerous.  A good many of them
receive a weekly allowance from the kirk-funds, of which
the kirk-session has the management.  These who receive sup-
ply in this manner, may, at an average, be about 16 or 18
in the summer season; but in winter, their number is com-
monly greater, as at that time of the year, such of them as
have health and ability to labour a little in the fields, find no
employment.  Besides the money arising from the weekly
collections at the church doors, which, at an average, is about
15 s. or 16 s. a-week, the kirk-session has the management
of the rents of a few acres of land, and some small feu-duties
belonging to the poor, the amount of which is about 30 L.
Sterling a-year.  To this may be added, the money aris-
ing from the loan of mortcloths, which is, communibus annis,
about 24 L.  There is likewise a charity workhouse belonging
to the parish, in which a considerable number of poor are
lodged, fed, and clothed.  There are at present in the house,
about 23 or 24, But sometimes there are 40 and upwards.
To support these poor, the kirk-session pays annually, the
sums of 40 L. Sterling, the heritors 50 L., and a contribution
by the inhabitants produces about 45 L. yearly.  There is a
housekeeper to superintend the poor in the house; and the ac-
counts are carefully kept by a treasurer appointed for the
purpose, and regularly examined, every month, by a com-
