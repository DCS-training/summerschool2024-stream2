60 years, are commonly employed in this fishery.  Five or
six row in each boat, And there are at present no sewer
than 78 boats in the parish, appropriated to the use  os
the fishing.  These boats measure from 15 1/3 to 18 1/2 feet
in length of keel; are rowed with fix oars, by a number of
rowers proportionate to the size of the boat; and use from
30 to 60 ground lines, each 55 fathoms in length, and ha-
ving from 18 to 20 hook fastened to it, by a smaller line,
half a fathom long.  Piltocks, which are almost always to
be obtained near the shore, are used as baits.  The fisher-
men direct their course in failing, by observations on the
land, called meeths, and formed from the bearingsof two
high eminences.  They distinguish the spots frequented by
the fish from observing the nature of the bottom.  When
successful in fishing, the smaller boats bring in about 300
lings; the larger from 500 to 600 in the season, besides con-
siderable quantities of cod and tusk.  Before the present
year, the value of fresh ling was about 4 s. a hundred
weight, of the fresh tusk, nearly the same, and of cod, 2 s. 8 d.
These prices have fallen, however, 20 per cent. in conse-
quence of the increased attention to fishing throughout all the
north of Europe.  The price of the dried fish is from 11 s.
to 14 s. 6 d. the hundred weight; and Government allows
the curer a bounty of 3 s. a hundred weight, which is call-
ed the debenture.  The attention of both landlords and te-
nants is turned toward the improvement and extension of
this fishery, as their best source of emolument.  The num-
ber of men employed in fishing is about 350, who go out in
70 boats.  The boats are put together here, but the boards
are brought, ready shaped and dressed, from Norway.
Two large boats, with decks, of 10 or 15 tons burden
each, are also employed in conveying fish, salt, etc. between
the creeks of this island and the port of Lerwick.
