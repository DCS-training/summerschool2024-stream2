so far back as November 1626, and those of them which may now
be called ancient, consist of three small folio volumes, densely, and
generally speaking beautifully written.  The first volume extends
from November 1626 to June 1650; Vol. ii. June 1650 to No-
vember 1682; Vol. iii. June 1690 to the end of 1709.  The
fourth volume, which we may regard as embracing a modern pe-
riod, begins with 1710, and ends with 1725.  From this period,
the unbroken line of sessional transactions continues, though com-
paratively barren of interest, and meagre in detail.  Our most an-
cient register of births and marriages is contained in a volume re-
covered some years ago, by the Rev. Dr Lee, who presented it
to the kirk-session of his native parish.  Births in this volume,
6th July 1626, to 30th October 1667; marriages, 9th. January
1641 to 1st Decomber 1671,--leaving a chasm in the register of
marriages from 4th June 1665, to 1st June 1666, a year of much
suffering and persecution in this parish and district.  With this
exception, these registers are complete in so far as insertions have
been made.  That of baptisms, however, gives but a very imper-
fect view of the number of births in the parish.
   In 1650, July 14, the session, considering the dangers of the
time, ordained the money in the poor's box to be taken out and
committed to the box-master.  From November of the same year
till January of the next inclusive, there was "no session keepit
because of the great troubles of the times." 18th May 1651, "the
pillar" (where penitents stood) "being pulled down by the In-
glishmen, and burnt, a forme to be sett before the pulpit," &c.
"The harden gown" (sackloth) "taken away by the Inglishmen."
In 1652, application was made to the session to contribute some-
thing for two women, upon whose corns the English army, upon
their march into England, "did leigar." The answer was, that
"this parish could not," having been itself frequently plundered
of late.
   Without entering farther into particulars, we may have some
notion, from these instances, of the sufferings of this parish and dis-
trict, during Cromwell's usurpation.  But greater evils awaited the
land, in an event which was hailed with a nation's joy; and for
which was appointed in this parish (14th June 1660) "a day of
thanksgiving for the mercies bestowed on the land in calling home
of the king and restoring him to his just right in peace." How
soon this joy was turned into mourning appears on the face of the
record a few months after.  From 1661 to 1664, almost no busi-
