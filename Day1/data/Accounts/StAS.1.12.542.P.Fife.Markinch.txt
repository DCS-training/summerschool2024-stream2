     Statistical Account

a regular one: it lies very nearly in the form of a horse-shoe;
supporting in 5 or 6 times broader than ordinary, and the open
space of the common size.  At the place where first discover-
ed, a little to the N. of the river Leven, the dip was directly
S.  In working forward, the field divided in two; one level
run toward the N. W., another to the N. E., and the crop
was wrought till within 12 feet of the surface.  The two
branches of the level separated further and further, and the
two crops did the same, leaving a space of many hundred sa
thoms between, in which was neither coal, nor appearance of
it: this space resembled the open part of the horse-shoe.  The
encreasing consumption of coal will appear from the following
state:

<TABLE>

From 1740 to 1763, the quantity of coal sold at Balbirnie appears to
  have been 42,135 loads, or 8,427 tons annually, which, in 23 years, is   192,811
From 1763 to 1777, both inclusive, the average sales were 46,719
  loads, or 9,343 tons annually,                                           140,157
From 1778 to 1792, both inclusive, the average quantity was 54,660
  loads*, or 10,932 tons annually                                          163,980
In 1784, owing to a scheme of lowering the price of the coal to all
  who were more than ten miles distant from the coal-works, there
  was an additional quantity sold, not included in the foregoing aver-
  age, of                                                                    4,047
                                                                           --------   
                          Total number of tons sold in 52 years,           500,995

</TABLE>

   On the supposition, that the demand for coal should not in-
crease above the average of the last 15 years, being 10,932
tons annually, but continue the same; and although on half
of the whole field of coal were yet entire (which certainly is
not he case), an equal quantity would be entirely exhausted
in less than 46 years.  But the increasing consumption must
be immense, when it is considered, that during the first 40
years, there was no other coal-work, except this, to supply

<FOOTNOTE>

*The loads in the above computation contain 27 stone Dutch weight each,
which is one third more than the sale load, or load sold to the country.  The
former is known by the name of the collier's load.
