who holds the plough walks by its sides and directs it with a
stilt or handle fixed on the top of it.  The driver, if he can
be so called, goes before the oxen, and pulls them on by a 
rope tied round their horns; and some people with spades
follow the plough, to level the furrow and break the clods.
The only crops are black oats, sown in April, and barley,
sown in May.  Both are reaped in the end of August, or du-
ring the month of September.  The want of inclosures has
prevented any attempts to sow artificial grasses; but the mea-
dows furnish a considerable quantity of natural hay.  The
parish can never supply itself with a meal.  A considerable
number of black cattle and sheep is annually sold to the Ler-
wick merchants, who kill them, and send them packed to 
Leith market; meal, flour, biscuits, barley, and other articles,
being bought in return.  The hills, in general, are covered 
with heath, and afford good pasturage for sheep, which go 
wild without any herdsman to attend them.  They are in 
general, however, so far tame, that they can be driven into
punds or small inclosures, where the wool is pulled off, the 
young lambs marked, and such ram lambs cut as are not in-
tended for tups to the stock.

   Lime has never been used as a manure, except in a very
few instances, where it never failed to produce great returns;
in some thirty, in some sixty, and in some an hundred sold.
But improvements by lime, or any other means, is seldom at-
tempted here, for this obvious reason, that the tenants have
no leases:  They consider themselves as the tenants of a day,
and have neither inclination nor spirit to attempt any effect-
tual improvement of the grounds they possess; thinking, and 
with justness, that another may reap the benefit of all the 
endeavours they might use to meliorate their farms.
