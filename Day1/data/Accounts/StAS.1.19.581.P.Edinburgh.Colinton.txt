     of Collington.

   The arable lands of the parish slope gradually from the
skirts of the hills to the level of the river; and they are in
different places from 250 up to 600 feet above the level of
the sea.  This occasions a great diversity of climate in the
course of three or four miles, and a great difference in the
ripening of the crops.

   Church.-The church was built in the year 1773, and is
a very decent and convenient structure for public worship.
Though plain, and executed at a very moderate expence,
it is rather elegant, both on the outside and inside.  It has
even served as a model for some parish churches that have
since been built.

   Manse.-The manse was built anno 1784, at an expence
sufficiently liberal, but with very insufficient workmanship.
This is the case with the generality of the manses in Scot-
land, and which renders them, in proportion to their size,
the most expensive houses in the kingdom.  Imperfectly
executed at first, and that usually for want of a proper su-
perintendence, their frequent repairs and rebuilding come
to be a matter of great inconvenience to the incumbents,
and of much additional and unnecessary expence to the
heritors.

   Stipend.-The stipend anno 1792 remained what it was
in the year 1635, amounting to L. 55:16:7 4/12 Sterling.
Since that time there has been an augmentation granted by
the Court of Teinds, which is not yet allocated.
   The fall of money in its value is well known to be a
great hardship, and especially of late, upon all persons of a
fixed income, and upon none more than upon the clergy of
Scotland.
