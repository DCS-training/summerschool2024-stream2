sons, of both sexes, is a proof; and the latter is con-
firmed by the early progress, and superior quality of
vegetable productions, beyond any other parish in the
district.  The climate, however, is very different, in
different situations.  In the whole tract of the Elk,
which is sheltered on all hands, the air is generally mild
and temperate, even in cold seasons; while it is sharp
and piercing, within the distance of a mile or two from
that situation.  The diseases incident to this parish are,
rheumatism, and those of the nervoous kind; which may
be induced by the humidity of the air, and coarse man-
ner of living; as the poorer class of the inhabitants are
most commonly affected with such disorders.  I am sorry
that a regard to truth obliges me to mention another
disease, namely, scrofula.  Whether this direful ma-
lady be indigenous, or was at first introduced by inter-
marriages, is not for the writer to determine.  But it
falls under his observation, that numbers in this place
are more of less infected with it.  And as it is an esta-
blished fact, that it may be propagated through a series
of generation, much caution ought to be used in form-
ing matrimonial connexions, as the only effectual way
of preventing the entail of this malignant disorder upon
posterity; thus lightening so far the load of humam woe.
   The prejudices of the people against inoculations are not
yet entirely removed, although many fatal instances 
have occurred, and are, at this very season, daily pre-
sented to their view; which, while they speak to their
feelings, ought also to enlighten their understandings.
The natural small pox has raged here for some time
past, with destructive violence, and swept off multitudes;
while fearcely an individual has suffered, that under-
went the process of inoculations.
