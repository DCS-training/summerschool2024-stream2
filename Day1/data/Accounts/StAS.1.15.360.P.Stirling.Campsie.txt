   Allowing our registers to have been accurately kept, which
I believe to be as much the case as in most country parishes;
it is evident that they are regulated By no general rule:  The
sudden influx of inhabitants have varied these registers ex-
ceedingly.  The following table exhibits all the facts rela-
tive to the present state of population:

   What is now stiled consumption, seems to have been un-
known in this distinct about 60 years ago; and I believe ge-
nerally unknown in Scotland:  Many causes have been as-
signed for this fact, by medical men.  Where people were
c1oathed in plaiding, which somewhat resembles flannel, as
was the case till very lately in this distinct, and where they
seldom were confined to work in warm houses, as is now the
case, great colds, the forerunners of consumption, would not
easily affect them.
