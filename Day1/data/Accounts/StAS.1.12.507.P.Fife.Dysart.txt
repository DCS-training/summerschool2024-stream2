     Of Dysart.

Pathhead, including Sinclairton, contained 1107 inhabitants:
in 1792, 2089.
   There are two villages, Galaton and Borland.  In the for-
mer, nailing was the chief business; and is still carried on.
But many weavers now reside there, who are employed by
the manufacturers in Dysart and Pathhead.  In 1756, it con-
tained 203 inhabitants; in 1792, 432.  Borland was begun in
1736, for accommodating the colliers, and has been since in-
creased.  It contains 196 inhabitants.
   In 1756, the numbers in the country were 241; in 1792,
409.  This increase is not from more farmers residing than
formerly, but from a number of weavers and some smiths
having from time to time built houses along the high road,
and in other places of the country.

   The causes of this increase of population are, an Anti-
burgher meeting-house being erected at Pathhead, which
drew those of that persuasion near it; the advantage of be-
ing near coal, and the encouragement for labour about the
coal-works; and what has contributed much more than either,
the rapid increase of the manufactures.
