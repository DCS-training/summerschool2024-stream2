whin stones quarries, which are easily got at, and good free
stone is to be had, at different places not far distant.  Ex-
cellent cattle are bred in the neighbourhood, which, when
three or four years old, bring, in the market, from six
to ten guineas.  This parish derives considerable advantage
from its situation, being about four computed miles from the
Frith of Tay, and nearly the same distance from St Andrews,
to both which the farmers send a great deal of grain.  Coal
is the fuel generally used here, and costs 2 s. 8 d. at the pit,
for the double horse cart.  The ploughs formerly used here,
were drawn by four oxen and two horses; now they are 
made much lighter, and drawn by two horses only.  There 
is nothing peculiar either in the strength, size, or stature of
the inhabitants, who in general live easy, and are disposed to
be industriuos.  They are a plain and frugal people, and en-
joy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of 
society.  There is a good bridge here over the Eden, consist-
ing of three arches, said to have been built by Archbishop
Spottiswood.  The roads in this neighbourhood are as yet in
bad repair.  The statute work is commuted.  Turnpike roads
are just beginning to be made.  Some of the debt land in 
this parish has been lately let at about 40 s. the acre; other
farms rent from 15 s. 20 s.  The parish in general is un-
inclosed.  There is hardly any alteration in this place more
remarkable, than the change in the people's dress, which,
within these 20 years, has become much gayer than formerly.
