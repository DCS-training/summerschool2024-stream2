pair. And though 106 years have passed away since its erection
it has still the appearance of great neatness, comfort, and dura-
bility. The avenues from the south and the north are lined by
rows of beautiful limes.
	As the church was built from subscriptions raised among the
operatives, residdnt chiefly in the town, for their own accomoda-
tion, it became their property, and was divided among them in
shares proportioned to the amount of their subscriptions. For
many years it was placed on the footing of a chapel of ease, and
received a constitution from the General Assembly. But in 1811,
with the consent of His Grace the Duke of Portland, the patron;
of the ministers of the Low Church; of the presbytery of the
bounds; and of three-fourths of the valuation of the landward he-
ritors,-the proprietors instituted, in the Court of Teinds, a process
of disjunction and erection into a separate parish quoad sacra,
which terminated favourably on the 19th of June the same year.
	The minister's stipend is not to be under 115 bolls of victual,
half meal, half bear, yearly, and not to exceed 144 bolls pay-
able in money, according to the highest fiars prices of the county
of Ayr, together with a sufficient sum for furnishing communion
elements. The minister receives the maximum. He has neither
manse nor glebe, but he receives the Government allowance in
lieu of them.
	There are two Dissenting chapels in the parish: the one is con-
nected with the Original Burgher Synod, and the other with the
United Associate Synod. Both are respectably filled, but what
amount of stipends their ministers receive, the writer of this has
no means of knowing.
	The High Church ir well filled, and the number of communi-
cants averages about 500.
