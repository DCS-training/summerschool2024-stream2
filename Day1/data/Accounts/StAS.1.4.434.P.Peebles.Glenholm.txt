and their meat, and 1 s. without their meat.  The wages
of a male servant are L. 6 a-year.  The wages of a female
servant are L. 1, 5 s. in the winter half year, and L. 2 in the
summer half year.  The reason why the summer wages do
so much exceed the winter, is the labour of the ewes milk-
ing, which is reckoned a severe task, which nothing but
high wages can induce them to engage in; and part of that
wage having been by long use paid in wool, the rise in the
price of that commodity has contributed to raise their
wages.-With respect to fuel, about 40 years ago peat was
almost the only kind of fuel that was used in this parish,
of which there is to be got very good in kind, but at a
great distance, on the top of steep hills, and difficult of ac-
cess; and hence the principal inhabitants have entirely
quitted the use of that species of fuel for many years past,
and find they can more easily provide themselves with
coals, and only such as are thirled to certain mills, (of
which there are 2 in the parish), do cast a few on those
heights for the purpose of drying their grain at the kiln,
which they are obliged to furnish by their thirlage.  The
cottagers are provided with a kind of peat, of an inferior
quality, which are to be found in low damp grounds, near
their dwellings, and are such as require a part of coal to be
used along with them.  The coals are brought from a great
distance; some from Douglas, which is reckoned best in
quality, and is about 14 or 15 miles distant; and some are
brought from Carlop, which is somewhat nearer.  The
price is 1 s. 6 d. a load, the load being 12 stone Dutch
weight.

   Antiquities.-There are in the parish remains or vestiges
of 6 old castles or towers, which were inhabited by the an-
cient proprietors of the grounds, and seem to have been
