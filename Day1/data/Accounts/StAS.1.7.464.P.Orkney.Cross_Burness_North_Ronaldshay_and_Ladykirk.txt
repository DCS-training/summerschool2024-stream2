     Ladykirk parish, now vacant.
                                            Males.  Fem.

As this charge is vacant, the precise population at present

females, in the several parishes, is as follows:

In Crosskirk parish, April 1787, as 5 31/45  males to 7 10/45 females.

In ditto, April 1791, as 5 11/40 males to 4 9/40 females.

have, from a notion they entertain, that those that leave the
