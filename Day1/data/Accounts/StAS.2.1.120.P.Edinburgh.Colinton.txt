looks over a fine expanse of country to the north and east. The old
house has been converted very adroitly into a decorative ruin, which
has attached to it two old fashioned gardens, flanked and divided
by the lofty holly hedges already referred to. Dreghorn Castle
was built about the same time with Colinton House, by Alexander
Trotter, Esq. It is embosomed among trees, some of which are
stately beeches belonging to the olden times, but the greater propor-
sion have been planted by the present proprietor, and are in a very
thriving condition. These are built of hewn freestone. Co-
miston House, the residence of Sir James Forrest, Bart was
built in 1815. And Craig Lockhart House was built by Dr
Monro, about fifteen years ago. It is sweetly situated on the
verge of the sloping wooded bank which runs down to the Wa-
ter of Leith. Lord Cockburn having feued a portion of land
from Gillespie's Hospital, at the foot of the Pentland hills, and
having greatly ornamented the place, built as an addition to the
small house at Bonally, a Peel Tower, which was finished this sea-
son. It is situate in a hollow, commands the pass through the hills,
and has a most interesting air. It is the lion of the parish.

			 III.-POPULATION.

   Before the middle of the seventeenth century this parish ap-
pears to have had but few inhabitants. Their number, however,
continued rather on the increase till the time of the seven years
famine, that is, from the year 1695 till 1702, during which pe-
riod it is said to have much diminished. In an information
presented to the Court of Teinds in 1709, this parish was said to
contain 318 examinable persons; if to these a third part be added
for unexaminable persons, the whole inhabitants would appear to
have then amounted to 424. From a record in possession of the
church, it appears that about the year

		1750, the population amounted to 782
          	1755, by Dr Webster's report,    792
                1791,         -        -        1395
                1801,         -        -        1392
   		1811,         -        -        1605
		1821,         -        -        2019
		1831,         -        -        2232
            Of this last number 1076 were males; and 1156 females.

   The population has since decreased, the amount in 1838 being
1982. The cause of this diminution, perhaps, is to be found in the
facts, that the extra work on many of the farms has been completed;
that in Hailes Quarry, manu fewer hands are employed of late, while
Redhall Quarry is not wrought; and that machinery has been intro-
duced into  three of the paper-mills, producing a great diminution in
