   Produce, etc.-The common crops are barley, oats and
potatoes.  The ordinary returns are, of barley, from 5 to 6
bolls; of oats, from 3 to 4; and of potatoes, from 6 to 8, for
1 boll.  Oats sell at from 13 s. to 15 s. per boll; barley from
15 s. to 17 s. ditto, Linlithgow measure; and potatoes from 2 s.
to 5 s. per barrel of 32 English gallons.

   Lakes, Rivers and Fish.-There is only one considerable
lake in these parishes, named Lochnell, from which one of our
principal heritors takes his title.  It is 2 miles in length:  Its
greatest breadth is 1/2 mile.  It has its name from the Gaelic
word Eal, signifying a swan, a great number of these fowls
frequenting it.  It is closely guarded by a zealous friend of
the family of Lochnell.  There are other lakes, but very in-
considerable.  There is only one small river, which runs about
3 miles, and then falls into an arm of the Western Ocean,
called Loch-feachan.  The fish in these lakes, and in the above
mentioned river, and smaller brooks, are salmon, trouts and
eels.  The salmon are found in considerable numbers in this
small river, but of small size.

   Sea Coasts, etc.-The coast is of a semicircular form; and,
including creeks and bays, may be about 20 miles in extent*.
It is in general high and rocky; but, at the end of the bays,
flat, and somewhat sandy.  The fish caught on this coast are
grey fish of different kinds, lythe, some cod and ling, skate,
flounders, etc.  There are no established fisheries: They have
been tried, but with little success; perhaps owing to want of

*There are vestiges of old castles, or watch towers, along the coasts of this
parish.  It is supposed these towers were built by the Danes.  They are built
in view of one another, that the alarm of an approaching enemy might be given
the more readily.
