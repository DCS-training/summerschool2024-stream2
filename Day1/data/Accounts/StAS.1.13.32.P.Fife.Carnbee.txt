was carried to a great length in this neighbourhood, many
of the farmers and others were, by various means, induced
to give assistance to the smugglers, in carrying away and
disposing of vast quantities of foreign spirits, which had a
very bad effect upon their health and morals.  Happily, how-
ever, that illicit trade is in a great measure abandoned,
and the farmers, with their servants, now employ themselves

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 4 respectable fa-

themselves to the Kirk of Relief; but when they have no
sermon there, they commonly attend the Established Church;
and it is but just to remark here, what must give pleasure

that there is nothing of that blind furious zeal among the sec-
taries in this age which too often disgraced the former.  The
sectaries and those who attend the Established Church, live
together in Christian charity, and act very differently to
one another in society, from what the Jews of old did to

the parish in general, were more attention paid to the cross
roads, and a greater proportion of the statute-work allow-

prietors, while enclosing and subdividing their lands, to allot
more of their ground for planting, it would in a few years
be a considerable advantage to themselves and the public,
as there are large tracts of ground in many parts of the pa-
rish which cannot be employed to better purpose.  Sir Ro-
bert Anstruther, and John Patullo Esq; commissary of St
Andrew's, have of late shown a very proper exampble in
this way, which it is to be hoped will soon be followed by
