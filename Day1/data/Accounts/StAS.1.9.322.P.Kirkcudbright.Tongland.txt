     Statistical Account

   The above is a just and natural description of this tre-
menduous fall of water, and perfectly agreeable to the ap-
pearance in nature.  The found and the sense are admi-
rably imitated by the poet.  Perhaps our favourite and
descriptive poet, Mr Thomson, could not have exceeded it,
had he seen the object with his own eyes.-At a consider-
able distance above the bridge, the doachs or cruives for
taking the salmon, are erected across the river.  In gentle
rises of the water, the salmon run into the cruives, and are
taken out sometimes alive, and sometimes dead, according
to the length of time they have been in the cruives.  Be-
low the bridge there is a place called the Sand-bed, into
which the tide flows at high water; here they take great
numbers by a boat and a very long draught-net, when the
tide flows.  A little above this, there is a deep and large
bason of water, called the Lin-pool, into which the salt-
water flows in spring-tides.  Here they take the salmon by
a boat with drag-nets; but, in general, by far the greatest
number of salmon, grilse and sea trouts, are caught in the
night time, by what they term the fishing with the should-
er-nets.  This mode of fishing is both curious and ingeni-
ous, and merits a minute description.  There is a small net
fixed to a semicircular bow of iron, and this is fixed to a
pole of about 18 feet in length.  The fisherman ties a
small piece of bended wood, with a groove in it, upon his
left shoulder, for the pole of the net to slide upon.  Thus
equipped, he takes his station in the night, upon a rock at
the side of a pool, where he knows the salmon lie, and
throws his net straight before him into the water, into
which it sinks, and draws it straight to him on the bottom,
sliding the pole upon the groove of wood upon his left shoul-
der, and when he has it near him, he gives the net a quick
turn over by the pole, and brings out the fish; and there
