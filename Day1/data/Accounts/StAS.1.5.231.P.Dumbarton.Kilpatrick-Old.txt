spect.  The banks of so fine a river as the Clyde, the
striking figure of Dumbarton castle, the wonderful divi-
sion in the ridge of mountains above Bouling Bay, and the
numerous woods,-all unite in rendering this prospect per-
haps one of the best in Scotland.  Mr Farrington, Royal
Academician of London, some years ago was employed to
take different views upon the rivers Forth and Clyde.  He
is a man of eminence in his prosession, and the view from
Dalnotter hill is supposed by many to be the best of the 
collection.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate is mild and temperate,
though, as is the case upon all the west coast of Scotland,
very rainy at some seasons of the year.  No epidemical
disease, however, prevails among the inhabitants.  They
are generally healthy, and though instances of extreme lon-
gevity cannot be produced, yet a man of the name of Da-
niel Montgomery, belonging to the parish, died within
these 2 years at the well authenticated age of 93; and du-
ring the incumbency of the present minister, he has known
many persons of both sexes live to the age of 85.

   Proprietors and Rents.-There are about 33 heritors,
great and small, in the parish, the principal of whom are
Lord Blantyre, the Lord President, Sir Archibald Edmon-
stone, Mr Hamilton of Barns, Mr Buchanan of Auchintor-
ly, Mr Stirling of Law, Miss Buchanan of Auchintoshan,
and Mr Dreghorn of Ruchill.  The valued rent of the parish
is L. 4441:13:8 Scotch.  The real rent is about L. 5000

closed and subdivided.  The average rent of arable land, in
the low part of the parish, is from 20 s. toe 30 s. per acre.
