     Statistical Account

the lower grounds are generally arable.  The former con
tains several extensive moors and mosses, which are chiefly
occupied in sheep-walks; the latter, (not the half of the
extent of the parish), is for the most part inclosed with
stone-dikes and hedges.  The soil is, for the most part,
of a stiff clay that becomes excessively hard when dry, and
generally has a wet cold tilly bottom.  In some districts,
however, are a few fields of a loamy soil, which produce
good crops of oats, barley and pease.  The climate is very
unfavourable for the culture of wheat; but the cultivation
of lint, potatoes, ryegrafs and clover, is attended with pro-
fit.  There is, however, more cropped with oats than with
all the rest put together.  The cultivation of turnip in the
open field is not practised, although, from some few trials
that were made on that profitable root, there is reason to
believe that it might be attended with considerable advan-
tage in several thousand acres in the parish.  Extremely
few of the lately improved implements of husbandry have
here been brought into practice.  The common Scotch
plough, wrought with four horses, is in general use.  The
farmer, before agriculture can be brought to any tolerable
degree of perfection, must direct his care to free his land
from under water, which almost universally prevails.  But
the practice of draining, although very much needed, meets
here with small attention.
   Few places afford better opportunities for irrigation than
this parish.  The country is abundantly supplied with ex-
cellent water that pours down from the adjacent heights in
springs and small rivulets, which could easily be directed
over the numerous declivities.  This mode of improvement
was a few years ago tried with success in Mr Dunmore's
estate.  The land over which the water was made to flow,
produced grass uncommonly luxuriant, and retained through
the whole year a fine verdure.
