Mr James Hutchison, and Mr James Browne, two of the trus-
tees.
	In virtue of an old charter, the burgess of Dumbarton are
exempt from river dues. From the time the exemption was first
claimed on 9th July 1825, to 8th July 1834, they amounted to
L. 4722, 13s. viz. sailing vessels L. 803, 13s. 4d; steam dittle
L. 3918, 19s. 8d, less L. 170, 3S. 1d. paid  by shareholders in stream-
boats, who were not burgesses of Dumbarton.
	The river dues have been greatly increased by steam naviga-
tion, as appears from the following statement. From 8th July
1833 to 9th July 1834, the river dues collected stood to the gross
revenue as follows; Total tonnage on merchandize 70 1/4 per cent.
ditto by sailing vessels, including ferries, 38 5/6 per cent; ditto by
steam ditto 31 5/8 per cent.; quay dues by ditto, 15 1/6 per cent; dit-
to by sailing ditto 5 1/3 per cent; shed dues 5 7/12 per cent.; ferries,
3 5/8 per cent. Total steam to total sailing vessels as 87 7/60 to 100
	The trusted in 1834, appointed Mr David Logan, civil-enginder,
a gentleman of great experience and scientific acquirements, to di-
rect the improvements of the river. At present great and merito-
rious exertions are making in widening the harbour and the nar-
row parts of the river, and deepening it throughout. While the pre-
sent trustees are entitled to high commendation for their exertions,
it is not our intention to detract from the merits of the former trus-
tees. Mr Golborne laid the foundation of the improvements of
the river, but it is to the praiseworthy exertions of individuals com-
posing the improvement committees during the last twenty years,
while following out the suggestions of the civil-engineers, that the
river has been brought to a state of so great perfection. At that pe-
riod the revenue, as has been already shown, was under L. 6000, yet
with that comparatively small sum, unaided by the large revenue
since obtained from steam navigation, important improvements had
been made, and it is no more than justice to Provost Dalglish (for
a long time chairman of the improvement committee) to say, that,
to the energies of his mind, sound judgement, and unwearied exer-
tions, the public are greatly indebted for the splendid improvements
on the river. The present trustees, with a revenue of L. 31,497,
subject only to the interest of the debt, amounting at last balance to
L. 125,231, 14s. 10d., will be enabldd to do a great deal towards
the general improvement of the river.
