out of which the whole water, when the river is not swelled,
rushes out to the great fall, with great violence, and with a
very striking effect.  As this caldron, which indeed has not
been measured, still appears to be very deep, the aperture
cannot reach to the bottom.  The aperture resembles a door,
or a large window, having a piece of the rock like a lintel still
remaining on the top.  When the whole water makes its
way through this opening, the height of the fall is lessened
perhaps 7 or 8 feet.  To a person looking up from the side of
the pool below, as no part of the river above is to be seen, it
has the appearance of a great body of water, from some pro-
digious spring, gushing out of the rock.  When the river is
large, the water runs over the lintel, as it formerly did at all
times, and then the height of the fall is as great as it ever
was.  Some months ago, a part of the rock on the south side
of the river, adjoining the fall, was broken off, and fell into
the pool below.  Yet this has made little alteration on the
fall; but the force of the water, will no doubt, in process of
time, make a great change on it.  The caldrons may be
equally well seen on both sides of the river; but the great fall
is seen to most advantage, from the south.  There is an access
to the side of the pool below, where the view of the fall is
most complete.  Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
is the most proper time to view it.  The sun then shines di-
rectly in front of the fall; and as there is a gentle vapour
continually arising from the pool, into which the water falls,
it exhibits to the eye, all the different colours of the rainbow
which, by the perpetual agitation of the wind, appear and
disappear, so as to form the most striking and picturesque
scene.
