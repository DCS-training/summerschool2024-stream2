that stream to the highest part of the road over the hill is
443 4/10 feet, above which the highest summit of the hill may
rise about 80 or 100 feet; so that the height of the hill is
about 700, or 720 feet above the level of the sea.  The hill
of dunnichen runs about 3 miles, in a south-east direction;
its summit forming the northern boundary of the parish.
The parish extends, from east to west, about 4 miles, and
from south to north, in one place, about 3 miles, narrowing
a little to the eastward.

Dunnichen, containing   1800

   The soil, in general, is fertile, producing wheat, flax, oats,
and barely.  The seasons are late, on account of its elevation.
One field is now sown with wheat near the summit of the hill
of Dunnichen, and at least 500 feet above the level of the
sea; no small proof of the possibility of extending agriculture
sucessfully on the sides od the high hills of Scotland. Dun-
nichen, containing about 50 acres, is in the center of the pa-
rish.  The moss of it was drained about 30 years ago, and
now affords a large supply of pears:  In all probability it will
furnish the neighbourhood with fuel for about30 years long-
er, and may then be made a rich meadow.  The rest of the
fuel is coal, brought by land from the port Arbroath; and
a small supply from extensive fir plantations, about 30 years
old.
