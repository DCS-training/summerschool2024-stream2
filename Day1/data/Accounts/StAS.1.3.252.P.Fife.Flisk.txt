     NUMBER XXXIV.

     PARISH OF FLISK.

     (County of Fife.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM GOURLAY.

     Situation and Extent.

   THIS parish is situated on the river Tay, opposite to
that beautiful, fertile country, the Carle of Gowry.
It is bounded by Birkhill on the east, and the castle of Bal-
linbrieck on the west, along the Tay.  This castle is an old
edifice, approaching fast to ruin, and which was long the
residence of the Rothes family.  It has been a place of good
accommodation as well as strength.  The extent of this pa-
rish is about three miles in length, and more than a mile in
breadth, in many places.
