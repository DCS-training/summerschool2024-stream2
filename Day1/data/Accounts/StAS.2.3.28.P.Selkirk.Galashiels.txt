greatest barrier to the industry and fertility of the district is its
great distance from coal and lime, and the principal market; all
of which would be brought nearer by a rail-road.  The value of
land would then quickly be doubled; and all the branches of in-
dustry, receiving a new stimulus from this improvement, the most
economical in the end, would commence a rapid growth.
