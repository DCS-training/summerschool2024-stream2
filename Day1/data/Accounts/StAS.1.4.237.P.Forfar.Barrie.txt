     of Barrie.

composed of a thirsty down, which barely suffices for the
grazing of a few stocks of sheep and of young cattle, inter-
spersed with some acres of arable land, which, in showery
seasons, yield a moderate crop of grain.  The upper divi-
sion is partly light loam, partly generous gravel, and a few
fields approach to a deep black soil.  The mould, though
in no respect rich, favoured by inclosure in many parts, and
aided in general by an enlightened husbandry, produces,
crops of wheat, barley, oats, peas, turnip, flax, clove, po-
tatoes, little inferior in quantity and quality to the growth
of the same extent of land in districts distinguished by a va-
luable soil.-Within the bounds of this small parish, a di-
versity of climate is experienced.  The lower division,
from its sandy nature, and the interposing banks which
hide it from the ocean, though sometimes covered with
hazy fogs, is warm is summer, and enjoys a kindly tem-
perature in the winter months.  The upper division, ele-
vated above the level of the sea, is sensibly cooler in the
warmest weather, and in winter feels the almost unbroken
severity of the winds from the E. and the N. W.  The
climate is not uncommonly hostile to the constitution.  The
inhabitants paid an annual tribute to the ague, while the
land continued undrained, and in rainy winters some com-
plaints of rheumatism are still heard of; but there are no
distempers strictly local.  It will readily be perceived, that
a climate, circumstanced as that of Barrie, must be friendly
to vegetable productions.  An early verdure covers the
fields.  The sowing season commences about the middle of
March, and the corns are generally lodged in the barn-
yard before the second week of October.  Migratory birds
visit this place very early in the season.  The parish might
perhaps claim the appelation of beautiful, did not the soil
in some parts, and the vicinity to the sea in others, deprive
it of the verdure of thriving and copious wood.
