times, however, of violence and disorder, this right was
sometimes interrupted, and occasionally exercised by the
King, by the Convention of Estate, by Parliament, or by
the citizens themselves;  but, according to the legal consti-
tution of the burgh, before the Revolution, the bishops and
Archbishops, and the Lord of Regality, on his coming in their
place, did, previous to the 1641, elect the Provost annually,
and also the Bailies, from leets for the latter, sent them by
the Town-council.  In more early times, the Council were
nominated by the Provost and Bailies;  so that, in reality,

1662, which restored the Archbishop to his ancient right
of naming the Provost annually, and of chusing the Bailies
out of the leets sent him by the Council, which gave him

his Privy-council, authorised a new and free election of the
Bailies and Council, by poll of the burgesses, and empower-

terwards, by an act of Parliament in 1690, the Town-
council got the power of chusing their own Magistrates,
and other officers of the burgh, as fully and freely as the
city of Edinburgh, or any other royal burgh:  The form
