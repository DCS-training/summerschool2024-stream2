about 70, exclusive of young ones; the number of black
cattle (December 1793) 380; a number less than usual,
on account of the apprehended scarcity of fodder: The
breed, a mixture of the Merse and Lammermuir kinds.
The sheep amount to upwards of 3500, and are of the Nor-
thumberland, Tweeddale, and Lammermuir breeds.-The
highest yearly rent for land within the parish, paid by one
farmer, is 900 L.; the lowest, 35 L.  There are several small
possessions, which bring from 15 L. to 35 L. of rent; but
the tenants of them are employed chiefly in driving lime
to the greater farmers, coals to tradesmen and others who
have not horses of their own, and stones and gravel to the
highways.  All the enclosed grounds of the parish are let
from 2 L. 2 s. to 15 s. the English acre.  The leases are
usually for 19 years.  The rent is all in money; no kain
or services are asked by the proprietors.  There are 2 corn
mills in the parish, to which the tenants are thirled; but
this restriction has not, in my time, been considered as

books is 3092 L. 14 s. 2 d. Scotch.  The present rent is
nearly 2660 L. Sterling, of which 2600 L. belong to the
estate of Langton; the remainder to two gentlemen who
hold of the proprietor of that estate.  Of the three heri-
tors, two reside in the immediate neighbourhood, and the
principal heritor resides in the parish occasionally.

   Population, &c.-According to Dr. Webster's report,
the population in 1755 was 290.  The number of souls in
the parish, according to a correct: list taken in the month
of July 1793, is 435.  Of there 211 are males, and 224
females.  In the same month, there were 65 married
couples, 8 widowers, and 20 widows.  All the widowers
