frankly feued the site of the village and cotton mills to
the benevolent Mr David Dale, at a very moderate feu-
duty.
   The next fall of consequence is the Stonebyres Lin, si-
tuated about 2 1/2 miles below the Corra Lin.  It is so cal-
led from the neighbouring estate of Stonebytes, belonging
to Daniel Vere Esq; but the grounds adjacent to the
fall, on both sides of the river, have lately been feued
or purchased by Mr Dale.  This cataract, which is about
eighty feet in height, is the ne plus ultra of the salmon, as
none can possibly get above it, although their endeavours,
in the spawning season, are incessant and amusing.  It is
equally romantic with the others; and like the Corra Lin,
has three distinct, but almost precipitate falls.  Wild rug-
ged rocks are equally visible here, and they are equally
fringed with wood; the trees however are by no means
so tall and stately, being composed of coppice wood.  Sal-
mon, pars (samlet,) horses muscle, or the pearl oyster,
though numerous below, are never seen above this fall.
   The next piece of natural curiosity is Cartlane Craigs,
upon the river Mouss, which enters Clyde about a mile be-
low the town of Lanark.  This is a curious and romantic
den, about a quarter of a mile in length, bounded on ei-
ther side by a reef of lofty precipitous and rugged
rocks, which are fringed with coppice wood on the
north side, and with coppice woad and thriving planta-
tions on the south.  The rocky bank on the north
side is about 400 feet in height, and it is not much
lower upon the south side.  Both banks are finely varied
with the different appearances of rock, wood and preci-
pice.  At the bottom runs the river Mouss, which scarce-
ly leaves room for the lonely traveller to traverse the
den; however, here the celebrated botanist, Mr Lightfoot,
