     Education.--There is but one school in the parish, centrically
   situated. The salary attached to the office, and paid by the pro-
   prietor, is L. 10 per annum. Advantage has not hitherto been
   taken of the late Highland School Act. The attendance at school
   averages from 50 to 70; and were it not for the poverty of
   the people, and the smallness of the salary, which prevents the,
   teacher from bestowing gratuitous education upon any, nearly
   double this number would avail themselves of the opportunity of
   receiving instruction, so much desiderated by the whole body of
   the people. None of the charitable educational societies of
   Scotland has yet stepped forward with a helping hand to aid in
   this benevolent object.
      Poor and Parochial Funds.--The funds for the relief of the poor
   are derived from collections in church, donations, and the interest
   an a small fund lodged in the bank. Through the liberality of the
   late Duke of Bedford, the present Dowager Duchess of Bed-
   ford, and the kind interest taken in the welfare of the poor, by
   Mrs J. G. Craig, Edinburgh, daughter to Sir J. P. Grant, the
   annual funds have averaged between L. 50 and L. 70 per annum,
   for the last ten years, which has placed the poor in a state of com-
   parative comfort.
     Fuel, &c.-The common fuel is peats and wood, of which there
   is great abundance in the parish.
     No fairs are held in this parish, and the only public-house is
   one at the boat-house of Inverdruie.
