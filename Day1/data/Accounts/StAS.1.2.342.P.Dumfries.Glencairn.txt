that part, are a good deal impaired, through time, by a rivulet.
There is another moat, or artificial mount, precisely of the
same form, and quite entire, at the march of the parish, south-
west, but within that of Balmaclellan.  Concerning the one in
this parish, there are some fabulous and superstitious traditions,
not worth mentioning.  The most common and credible ac-
count given of it is, that it was intended to be a kind of watch-

   Lake.-At the south-east side of the parish, there is a loch,
called Loch-Orr, out of which the river Orr issues.  It bor-
ders with the parishes of Glencairn, Dunscore, and Balma-
clellan, and is about 3 English miles round.  It is 9 fathoms
at the deepest, and surrounds a small island, where there are the
remains of a stone wall, which appears to have been original-
ly of great strength, and contains within it several apartments
now in ruins.  Its water appears extremely black, the ground 
under and about it, being generally moss covered with heath.
A vast number of water fowls bring forth their young on the
island, where there are some bushes.  Eagles have been known
to breed on it.  At the extremity of the loch, there is a penin-
sula cut by a deep trench.  The only fish in it are pike, (some
of which are said to be about 5 feet 10 inches long,) and a few
very large trouts.

   Miscellaneous Observations and Manners.-There are no
manufactures carried on in this parish, the greater part of

to Galloway were completed, and that from Ayr to Dumfries,

Craigdarroch, (which only wants about 5 miles), considerable
