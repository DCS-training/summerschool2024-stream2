ing demand for country produce, now amply returns the fa-
vour, by equal demands on the towns for their merchandise
and manufactures:-The industry, sobriety, and frugality of
its inhabitants, which virtues, having been confirmed by long
habit, will probably continue to be reputable for a long period
to come.  In addition to these, it must draw the most signal
benefits from the excellent turnpike roads lately constructed,
and continuing to be extended through all the principal dis-

For these the town is entirely indebted to the exertions of a

an almost total want of public walks and open places, to which
sedentary or delicate people may resort, and children be car-
ried for air and exercise.  Several have been, or are about to
be converted to private purposes: one, which is the best and
most important, is generally inaccessible, through the badness
