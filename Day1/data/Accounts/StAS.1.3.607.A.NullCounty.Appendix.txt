same manner over his whole estate, which is very much to
the satisfaction of his tenants, who have readily adopted his
plan of improvements, in croping their respective farms.
Last summer they drove a vast quantity of lime from Perth,
allowing about 30, 40, or 50 bolls of shells to the acre.  As the
length and tediousness of carriage bears rather a little heavy
on the tenants, he has it in contemplation to try to discover
marle on his grounds, and entertains hopes of succeeding.
The hills have been tried for lime stone, but without success.
The crops, till last year, were only black oats, bear, potatoes,
and lint.  This last agrees exceedingly well with the soil,
producing to the amount of 12 l. 14 s. per acre.  But they are
now sowing pease, and intend to try grass crops and turnips,
and it is hoped these experiments will succeed.  They have
already begun to roll after harrowing.  They have entirely
laid aside the old mode of plowing, which was 4 horses,
yoked side by side, with a driver, or rather leader, who plyed
before the horses, held them by the head, and travelled
backwards.  They now plow with only 2 horses, and no dri-
ver.  They still retain the old Scotch plough.  The feed
time, for oats, is in April; for bear, in May.  Harvest be-
gins about the end of September and beginning of October.
In unfavourable seasons it is later.

   Animals.-Formerly all the tenants kept sheep; but they
are now restricted to the farms that are nearest the hills,
which are divided into sheep walks.  The horses and
cows are, as yet, very little improved.  The tenants hitherto
had their apiaries, the honey of which was in very great re-
quest, owing, perhaps, to the bees having no other food but
the blossoms of heath, and other wild mountainous flowers.
The hills of Logie-Amon abound with muir fowl, heath
cocks, and partridges in the corn fields, with plovers
in the season, and a great number of hares.
