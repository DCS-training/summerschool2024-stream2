ant crops, inferior neither in quantity and quality to any in
the country; but, in the far greater part of the parish, the
ground is black, light, shallow, and spungy; incapable of re-
sisting violent impressions either of heat or cold; not reten-
tive of moisture in the droughts of summer, and apt to eject
the roots of tender plants in the intense frosts of winter.-
The air is extremely sharp and piercing.  The most prevalent
distemper is the rheumatism; commonly attributed to the in-
fluence of the east wind, which blows here with unusual keen-
ness.-The river Don*, which forms the north-east boun-
dary of the parish, is well known for its excellent salmon,
which would be more abundant here, were it not for the cruives
placed a little farther down the river.  Pike and trout are also
found in the Don, which is not navigable.  There are also 6
rivulets abounding with small trouts and eel; several chaly-
beate springs; and three very copious springs of water of a
most excellent quality in the parish.

   Produce, Rent, etc.-The principal vegetable productions
are oats, barley, sown grasses, turnips, and potatoes.  About
two thirds of the arable ground are annually cropped with
oats and barley; and large quantities of grass and turnips are
raised upon the more extensive and improved farms in the pa-
rish.  So sensible are the people, in general of the advantages

*About 1730, in a fine summer morning, between 5 and 6 o'clock, the
bed of this river, for the space of 3 miles below the church of Dyce, was found
entirely empty; and was passed and repassed by several persons who gathered
the fish that lay Sprawling in the bottom.  No person observed the commence-
ment of this uncommon phenomenon.  About half an hour after its discovery,
the water came down the channel again in a full body.  This was occasioned
probably by a charm formed by some internal commotion of the earth, which
was sensibly felt by some persons.
