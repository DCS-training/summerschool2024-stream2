sown grass for summer feeding and hay.  They allow that
white clover and rye grass succeed with them, but complain
that the roots of the red clover are frequently thrown out in
spring.  Inclosing, draining, and clearing the ground of
stones, are much wanted in this district.-The crops raised
in it are barley, oats, potatoes, a small proportion of pease,
turnips, sown grass, and some flax.  All the flax raised in the
parish is spun in it; and the rents of many or the smaller farms
are mostly paid, with the money got for the yarn, spun in the
winter months.

   Improvements, Farm Rents, etc.-Greater progress in im-
provement has been made in the southern district, than in
the other.  Here the new method of husbandry is more ge-
nerally practised, and excellent crops are raised of wheat,
pease, barley, oats, potatoes, turnips, grass, and also some
flax.  But even here sufficient attention is not paid to a proper
rotation of cropping.  The following rotations are most uni-
versally observed.  Where wheat is raised, the rotation is this;
after grass comes oats, then summer fallowing; then wheat,
pease, barley, oats with grass feeds The dung is given to
the wheat.  In the division for pease, potatoes and turnips
are raised along with the pease, and get a little dung.  Some-
times the grass is kept 2 or 3 years but more frequently
only one year.  On the farms where wheat is not sown, the
following rotation takes place: After 3 crops of grass, the
ground is broken up for oats, of which one crop is taken.
The oats are followed with turnips, potatoes, and pease in
one division.  Barley, with grass seeds, succeeds the green
crop.  The dung is given to the green crop in the divi-
sion for oats, a proportion of flax is sown, and not unfre-
quently a crop both of barley and oats is taken after the
green crop, and the grass seeds in that case are sown with
