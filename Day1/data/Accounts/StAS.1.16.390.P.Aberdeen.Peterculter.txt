lected in this manner, in dead water at the edge of the ri-
ver, which probably gave rise to the opinion of their pro-
ceeding in shoals.
   Struck with the appearance of the eels when I first ob-
served them, I made an attempt to calculate what number
might pass in a day, or in a season, and found it to be less
than I at first imagined.  Having only made an observa-
tion or two, I am not supplied with sufficient data for
accuracy; but I shall compute by my first observation.
Some assert that 2 eels, at least, pass in one second: Say 3
in 2 seconds, or 90 in a minute; and there being 7 in a
row, the number is 630 in a minute, or 37,800 in an hour;
which, being doubled for both sides of the river, makes
75,600 in an hour, or 1,814,400 in a natural day; the half
of which might be added for the second day, and an eight
part more for the third day.  Another conceit occupied
my mind, and that was, what number there might be at
once betwixt this and the mouth of the river, a space of 10
miles, supposing both sides of the river covered as per ob-
servation first, the ranks close, 7 in each rank, and each of
them 9 inches long?  But I shall not transgress farther on
the reader's patience with this theory or calculation.  I
shall only remark, that the number which appears here
must be less than at some distance below this, because so
many of them make their way up every rill and burn
which runs into the river.
   It is scarce necessary to mention, that eels make a like
annual procession up every river, water, and rivulet, which
disembogues into the sea.

   Whimsical Division of Parishes.-Sometimes a part of a
parish lies on each side of the river, although there be no
bridge, and the communication by boat be frequently im-
practicable.  Generally the parish-churches stand on the
