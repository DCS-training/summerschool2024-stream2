stretching from end to end, very inconvenient from its nar-
rowness, as well as from the badness of its pavement; and,
towards this street, the ends or gables of the houses are ge-
nerally placed, which gives the town rather an aukward ap-
pearance.  The time when, and the persons by whom this
place was founded, are both of them lost in the darkness of
antiquity.  If credit is to be given to the Poems of Ossian,
to the time when they are thought to have been written, and
to the interpretation that has been given of them, it was of
considerable note at a very early period.  This was perhaps
the Carricthura of that justly celebrated work, where was
the Palace of Cathulla King of Innistore, which was be-
sieged by Trothal, on account of an indignity which he ima-
gined he had received from that Prince, and which was af-
terwards delivered by Cathulla's good friend and ally the
mighty Fingal.  The Danes, we are informed, called it Kirk-
ivog, which both Buchanan and Forfeus improperly thought
should have been written Cracoviaca; and that this word
had first been corrupted into Circua, and thence to Kirkwall.
But all these words are said to signify the same thing, name-
ly, Kirkvaa or Kirkwaa, the Great Church, or perhaps the
Church of St Magnus.-The number of houses it contains
amounts to about 300; and, though it be the common prac-
tice for one family only to occupy a house, yet it sometimes
happens that a house lodges two, or even more families.
Many of these houses bear strong marks of old age, as the
doors and windows are very small, the walls uncommonly
thick, and almost all the apartments narrow, gloomy, and
irregular.  To this form, however, there are also many ex-
ceptions; for such of them as have been lately repaired or
rebuilt, and particularly such new ones as have been erected,
may, both for elegance and conveniency, compare with those
of any other town of the same extent in Scotland.
