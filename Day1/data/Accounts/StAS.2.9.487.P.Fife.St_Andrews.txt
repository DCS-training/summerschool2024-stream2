who entertained these sentiments; and having ascertained that his
Sovereign James I., at that period a prisoner in England, heartily
approved of such an establishment, he determined, with the, co
operation of some of the most enlightened of the ecclesiastics of
his diocese, to erect an university at St Andrews. And the,sanc-
tion of the Pope being at that period regarded as necessary to le-
galize such an establishment, he applied to Benedict XIII., who
was recognized by the Scottish nation as the duly constituted head
of the Church, who readily approved of the measure, and who
sent him a bull, sanctioning and confirming the new erection. By
this charter, the bishop of the diocese was recognized as the chan-
cellor of the university, authority being conveyed to him to confer
degrees in theology, laws, medicine, and the arts. The funds at-
tached to the institution were at first extremely limited ; but the
individuals who were appointed to superintend the different de-
partments of study, and who in general enjoyed endowments from
other sources, were enthusiastic in the cause; and although they
received but little remuneration for their labours, they persevered
in their effort and attracted to their prelections multitudes of
young men from the several districts of the kingdom.  At the head
of the institution a rector was placed, of whom, by the charter of
erection, it was required, as a necessary qualification, that he should
be a graduate in one of the faculties, and that he should be in-
vested with holy orders.
   St Salvator's College.--James Kennedy, the successor of Ward-
law in the discharge of the Episcopal functions at St Andrews,
judging the scale of the original institution of the university to be
too limited for the great concourse of students, prepared the way
for its farther extension and improvement, by the erection of the
College of St Salvator in 1455, with which he incorporated for
an endowment the rectorial tithes of the parishes of Cults, Kem-
back, Denino, and Kilmany, the three principal masters of the
college, being constituted rectors of the three first enumerated
parishes; and the fruits of the last being reserved as a common
fund, for the use and maintenance of all the founded persons, who
were thirteen in number, together with their attendants and ser-
vants. This erection was also sanctioned with the Pope's autho-
rity, who bestowed on it the privilege of conferring degrees in the-
ology and the arts.

of the Augustinian Monastery at St Andrews, made an additional
