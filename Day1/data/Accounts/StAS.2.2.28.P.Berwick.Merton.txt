   Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The total number of acres in
the parish is about 5550. The number of acres annually sown,
and the average return per acre, may be nearly as follows:-

                        Acres.    Average return in
				  bushels per acre.
	Wheat,           434                 21
	Oats,            951                 34
	Barley,         1561                 29
         Peas,           139                 22

for bay, as circumstances may require. Much improvement has
taken place within the last twenty years in every department of
farming, though much yet remains to be performed. A good deal
of ground has been drained, and a considerable quantity of lime
used; the expense, however, of the latter is so great, from 10s. 6d.
to. 13s. per single cart,-that an adequate remuneration is seldom
