great expense rendered no less profitable to the proprietor, than

Oats, 6020 bolls, at 18s. per boll,                                          L. 5418 0 0
	As my predecessor, Mr Fraser, in his Statistical Account, states
	   the number of acres sowm in oats forty years ago at 2123, which
	   at only five bolls per acre, a very moderate average, would amount
	   to 10,615 bolls, and as a still greater quantity is produced now,
	   the feed and seed oats cannot be included in the above. Feed
	   oats mean the meal used by the family and servants, and the corn
	   consumed by the cattle on a farm; and seed oats those required
	   to sow it. Many farms in the parish aword an average of 8 or 9
	   bolls per Scotch acre.

				V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Carnwath is the nearest market-town. It	is 2 1/2 miles from
Libberton church.
	Means of Communication.--There is no toll-road in the parish,
except the one betwixt Glasgow and Peebles, which passes through
the north-east corner of it for nearly a mile; and many of the pa-
rish reads are bad, as they extend about 30 miles, and would re-
