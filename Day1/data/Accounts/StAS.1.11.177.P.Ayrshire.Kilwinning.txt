     of Kilwinning.

For a number of years past, quite the reverse has been the
case.  The month of May, in particular, has been very cold
and wet, and unfavourable to vegetation; and, in some years,
we have had very little of what may be reckoned summer
weather.  The harvest of course, then, was much earlier than
it has been since.  In several places in the neighbourhood, it
is said, the harvest was finished about the latter end of August.
The facts themselves are here barely stated:  The physical
causes of so very remarkable a change are left to be accounted
for by others.

   Character of the People.-The people are, in general, very
decent, sober, honest and industrious.  Owing to the silk and
muslin manufactures, several strangers, of late, have settled
in the town.  What effects these, in time, may have, on the
morals of the people, cannot as yet be said.  Though the only
civil officer in the place be a constable, there are fewer riots
committed, than in most other places equally populous and
extensive.  It is now upwards of 22 years since the present
incumbent was ordained, during which time no inhabitant of
the parish has been banished, or suffered a capital punishment.
