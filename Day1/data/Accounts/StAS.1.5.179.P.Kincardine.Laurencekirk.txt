employed principally by him.  The village has also 2
smiths, 3 masons, 4 shoemakers, 5 tailors, 10 wrights, and
1 stocking-maker, besides an attorney, a surgeon, and an ar-
tist for drawing.

   Church and Poor.-The church was built in 1626; the
manse in 1731.  These buildings have been both repaired
from time to time, but at present they stand greatly in need
of farther reparation.  The church is by much too small for
the congregation.  The masters of the New College of St
Andrew's are patrons of the parish.  They were first con-
stituted titulars of the tithes, by Archbishop Hamilton in
1550.  Sixty-two years afterwards they were ordained by
the Commissioners of Parliament, perpetual patrons; and a
stipend of 250 merks Scotch, the kirk lands pertaining to the
college, as glebe, and a manse decerned to the minister.
The present value of the living, including 19 acres of glebe,
and kirk lands, and estimating the victual stipend at 12 s.
Sterling a boll, is, at least, L. 90 Sterling.-About L. 25
Sterling, the annual amount of the Sunday collections,
with the interest of some small mortifications, is divided a-
mong 12 poor householders.

   Population.-The inhabitants of this parish are chiefly of
the established church.  Few Seceders or Episcopalians, and
only two Roman Catholics reside here.  The whole num-
ber, to which the population at present amounts, including
persons of all ages and denominations, is about 1200, which
is about 450 more than the amount in 1755, being at that
time, according to Dr Webster's state of the population of
Scotland, only 757 souls.  The annual average of births is
33, of deaths 30, and of marriages, 15.
