     of Kilmadock or Doune.

   The church, or monastery, it is to be presumed, was there-
fore, originally dedicated to this saint; and hence the parish
obtained the present name.  There are many other names of
parishes in Scotland from the same origin.  Such are Kil-
martin, Kilmalie, Kilmarnock, etc.
   Formerly, the church stood on the spot just mentioned;
but having become ruinous, a new church was built in the
town of Doune, in the year 1756; since which period, the
parish has been frequently called Doune.  The origin of
this name will be explained under the title Doune Castle.

   Situation.-This parish is part of the western district of
Perthshire, and comprehends a considerable portion of the
ancient stewartry of Monteith.  It is situated in the presby-
tery of Dunblane, and synod of Perth and Stirling; and lies
very near the centre of Scotland.
   Both the ancient and present churches lie low.  But the
greatest part of the grounds in the parish command a grand
view of Benlomond, and the neighbouring mountains, and a
beautiful prospect of the castle of Stirling, and the fine coun-
try that enriches the banks of the winding Forth; nor is the
scenery rendered less beautiful, by the romantic banks of
the Teith, which washes the sides of the ancient castle of
Doune, and rolls along the picturesque groves of Blair-
Drummond; and while the eye of the beholder is exhausted
by the endless variety of the objects in view, its fatigue is ge-
nerously relieved by the stupendous hills of Tough, Gar-
gunnock, and Kippen, that extend, in a noble ridge, from
east to west, for the space of 20 miles.

   Extent, Soil, Produce.-This parish lies north and south;
and, like most of the other parishes in Scotland, is irregular
in form.  The neighbouring parishes are, Muthill on the
north, and north-east; Kippen on the south; Dunblane, and
