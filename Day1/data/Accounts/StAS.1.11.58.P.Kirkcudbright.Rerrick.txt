   Manners and Character.-All ranks, both in their appear-
ance and manner of living, make a very different figure from
their immediate forefathers.  The same reasons, that account
for similar changes, that have taken place over all the country,
will no doubt apply here; these alterations being nowise pe-
culiar to the inhabitants of this parish.  The people here, in
general, are peaceable, humane, and hospitable; have a lively
sense of decorum and character; and many of them give in-
dubitable proofs, that their minds are deeply influenced with
rational piety.  As an evidence of their sobriety and tem-
perance, there are not two men in the whole parish, who
are so far enslaved by a habit of drinking, as not to provide
for their families, notwithstanding the many temptations
their are exposed to, from the variety and abundance of fo-
reign spirits, illegally imported on the coast; and (what is
perhaps the cause of a still more general debauchery), the
cheapness of whisky.  In respect, both of civil and ecclesiasti-
cal matters, the inhabitants may justly be said to be a people
who "meddle not with them that are given to change."  The farm-
ers here, as well as through the country at large, are a set of
civilized, conversible, and well informed men, far superior to
those in the same station in many other places of the kingdom.
Their line of business, being chiefly in the cattle branch, by
which they are often led out into the world, and frequently
into the company of gentlemen, who, here, are all either spe-
culative or practical dealers in cattle, gives an illumination to
their minds, and a polish to their manners, which those, in a
mere grain country; are absolute strangers to.
