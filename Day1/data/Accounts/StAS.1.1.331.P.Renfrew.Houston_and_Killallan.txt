ture of small stones and earth, in the form of a barrow or
tumulus.

   But whether these stone coffins were older than the Ro-
man government in this country, or later, or upon what oc-
cation so many people were buried there in that manner, and
several in one stone chest, is not known.  It seems to have
been the consequence of a battle or skirmish between two
hostile parties; which was the case not 200 years ago, be-
tween families, through most part of Scotland, who often
met their enemy, with their vassals and dependants, and
slaughtered one another.

   About half a mile to the south-west of Houstoun mansion-
house, there is a mount composed of a vast number of small
stones, in which was found one of the like stone coffins; and,
opposite to it, directly northward, there is another of the
same kind, composed of earth and small stones, in a circular
form.  They were both lately enlarged, inclosed, and plant-
ed with forest trees.  These two mounts may have been the
ground of two opposite camps of warriors, fighting near the
place where the stone coffins were found.
