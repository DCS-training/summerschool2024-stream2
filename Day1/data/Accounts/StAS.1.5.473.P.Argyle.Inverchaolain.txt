subsistence for themselves and families.  Happily for them,
they were mostly removed to the neighbouring towns,
where they found sufficient employment, and where many
of their children, by the advantages of education, (which
they could not enjoy in their own country), have raised
themselves to independence, become useful members of the 
community, and a support and comfort to their parents in
their old age.  The numbr of families, at present, is 83,
of souls, 504.  The annual average of marriages is 4, and
of births, 12.  There is no register of burials kept.

   Proprietors and Rent.-Seven heritors have property in
this parish, one of whom, (Mr Campbell of South-hall),
has nearly the one half.  Not influenced by the general
taste for dissipation and extravagance, so prevalent among
most young men of fortune, he passes the greatest part of
his time upon his own estate, ornamenting his delightful
place of residence, which commands a beautiful prospect of
the Frith of Clyde, island of Bute, and village of Largs,
with that much admired place belonging to Lord Glas-
gow, called Kelhurn.  He, and Mr Lamont of Knock-
dow, are the only residing heritors.  The valued rent of 
the parish is L. 204:8:5 Sterling, and the real rent may
be about L. 1500 Sterling.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Natural woods, such as oak,
ash, hazzle, birch, etc. are a considerable article of sale.  They
are cut down at 20 years old.  The only planting is about
Mr Campbell of South-hall's mansion house, and Mr La-
mont of Knockdow's.  There are grouse in the hills, and
black cocks in the woods, a few partridges in the low
grounds, and plenty of hares.  The manners of the peo-
ple, dress, prices of labour, and language, are the same
with those of the neighbouring parishes, which have been
already communicated to the public.
