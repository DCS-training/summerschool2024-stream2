hour after 9 o'clock, when the moon is new and full.  It has
from 4 to 6 fathom water, over a bottom of hard clay co-
vered with sand.  On the west side of it is a fine beach, with
abundance of excellent fresh water; and as it opens to the
south-west, it is extremely convenient for ships bound to the
southward.  In antient times it seems to have been called E-
lidarwick; for we are informed by an Icelandic manuscript,
