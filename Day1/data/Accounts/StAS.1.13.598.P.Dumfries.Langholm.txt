which, at the beginning of the last century, was Lord of
the regality of Eskdale, and first erected Langholm, in
1610, into a burgh of barony, designed in the charter Ar-
kinbolm.  He afterward, in 1622, granted a new char-
ter of erection to 10 cadets of the family, upon condi-
tion that each of them should build a house in the town, in
which it is designed Langholm; along with the houses, of 
which 4 only were built, he granted to each of them a
merk land; of these, Mr Maxwell of Broomholm still pos-
sesses five and a half.  Wauchope castle, where the old 
manse stood, was the first residence of the Lindsays in Scot-
land. It appears from history, that they first came into 
this country from the manor of Lindsai in Essex, about the
beginning of the 12th century, with Malcolm Canmore.
Having ingratiated themselves with that prince, when in
England, he brought them down, and conferred  upon them
the lands of Wauchopedale, &c. and from them it is sup-
posed that the family of Crawford, and the other noble fa-
milies of that name deduce, their origin.  It is situated on a
steep precipice, beautifully romantick, upon the river
Wauchope, which, with its waters murmuring below 
among the pointed rocks, and the opposite banks finely 
shaded with pendent oaks and underwood, render the situ-
ation grand and picturesque.  In those days it has been a 
place of great strength.  The softe, and other out-works of
this ancient castle, are still clearly discernible.  An old 
tower near Broomholm was taken down about 50 years 
ago, during the present proprietor's minority, which he still
regrets.  Mr pennant, when in this country, was clearly of
opinion, that the house of Broomholm, which is surrounded
by the most enchanting scenery, stands in the heart of an
old British town, and answers to Caesar's description, "op-
pidum slyvis paludibusque munitum quo," &c. ( Caef. de Bell )
