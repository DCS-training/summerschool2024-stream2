there are several inclosures here and there, especially near
the town.  The number of horses may be about 125 and of

sells at 3 d. 3 1/2 d. or 4 d. a pound; butter 7 d. a pound; hens

used here is coal from Douglas, 11 miles off; 3 loads, or 1
horse draught, comes to 3 s. 3 d.; but some people use peats
from Biggar moss, though these are difficult to procure, and
at the same time expensive.  An expert man servant, main-

in harvest, the daily wages of a man are 10 d. and of a wo-
man 8 d.  Carpenters earn 1 s. 3 d. a day, and masons 1 s. 6 d.
or 1 s. 8 d.
