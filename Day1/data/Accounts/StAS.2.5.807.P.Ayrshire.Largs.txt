In 1666, he acquired the lands of Monkcastle and Craigmill from
John Hay, and transmitted them to his family, who sold them in
1703 to Mr Adam Cunninghame, advocate.  He was succeeded
in Largs by Mr Charles Littlejohn.  Fountainhall, states that,
"on his pursuing Montgumerie of Skelmurlie for his stipend, the
chancellor had this expression, that the ministers were tbe persons
in the kingdom that deserved worst at his Majesty's hands."  Mr
Littlejohn was succeeded by Mr John Wilson, who was ordained
26th December 1697.  He had been previously settled in Ireland,
and received a call to Kilmarnock, but declined to accept.  He
was succeeded by Andrew Cuming, who was ordained 27th Sep-
tember 1701.  He remained in the charge until his death in 1762.
Patrick Wallace was ordained his assistant and successr on 10th
August 1748, but, having predeceased him, Gilbert Lang was or-
dained to the office on 3d August 1756.  He died in 1791, and
was succeeded by Stephen Rowan, who was ordained 15th May
1792, and died 4th June 1801.  His successor was John Mitchell,
M. D., who was ordained 22d April 1802.  In 1826, he was ap-
pointed Professor of Divinity in the University of St Andrews,
and on his removal, was succeeded by Jacob Richardson, who was
ordained 28th September 1826, and having died 6th October
1830, was succeeded by the present incumbent, who was ordained
28th April 1831.
   By the decree of locality at Mr Craig's instance in 1635, it ap-
pears that the lands of Southanan, Whiteside, and Corsby, were
in the parish of Largs, and after their disjunction and annexation
to Kilbride, the stipend of the parish was 8 chalders and 8 bolls
victual, for stipend and communion elements.  This stipend con-
tinued until after the death of Mr Rowan, when Dr Mitchell got
an augmentation in 1807, of 43 bolls meal, and 43 bolls barley,
with L.8, 6s. 8d. of communion elements, so that the whole sti-
pend was 13 chalders, and 14 bolls of victual, and L.8, 6s. 8d. of
money.  The stipend is now 128 bolls meal, 128 bolls barley,
and L.10 money, to which it was modified 7th July 1830.
   The church and parish were in the Presbytery of Irvine until
1834, when they were transferred to the newly formed Presbytery

sition had no connection with this 'whether he would for the future refuse to give
baptism to the children of such parents as took the bond for public peace ?'  This be-
ing new to him, and what he did not understand the design of,'craved that he might
be spared as to such things as related to the discharge of his ministerial office.  He
is presently removed, and the council decern him to have lost the benefit of his indul-
gence at the Largs, or any where else ; and appoint their sentence to be intimated
to the parishioners, that they may pay him no more stipend.  I do not find the in-
dulged ministers were before challenged upon this score."
