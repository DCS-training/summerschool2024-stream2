and upon the sown barley grounds to preserve the moisture
from the violent exhalation.  All curved and broad ridges
are now done away and the ridges are made straight and
narrow; the surface is by far more neatly dressed than for-
merly and gives pleasure to the beholder.  It is only with-
in these few years, that wheat or barley were sown m the
parish to any extent; but now a considerable quantity of
both.  The wheat is generally sown after potatoes, fallow,
and beans or pease, and the time of sowing, from the middle
of September even till the end of November; but the
greater portion in October.  Beans, pease, and oats, from
the beginning of March to the middle of April.  The
greatest part of the beans are in drills, which are dressed
with the hand-hoe, and furrowed up with a light plough,
constructed for that purpose, with a mould board on both
sides, in summer.  There used to be a great quantity of flax-

the tenants.  But of late, the price of the seed and rent of
land have risen to so great a height, that but a small quan-

Potatoes the whole of April; and bear and barley from
the beginning to the end of May, among the latter, grass-
seeds are sown, and rolled down.  Turnips, of which there
are now large fields, are sown from the middle of June to
the middle of July.  The farmers use turnip to fatten
cattle with for sale, and which are bought in; for having
little or no natural pasture, they raise few or none.  To
the same purpose their crops of hay are applied, and by
this means increase the fulzie for their grounds.  The har-

1st of September, and by the first and second week of Oc-
tober the crop is wholly got into the barn-yards.  Of wheat,
