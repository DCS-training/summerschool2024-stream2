kind of crop; if lest fallow for 6 years, and not pastured
by sheep, it is covered with heath.  The meadows, in
warm rainy seasons, give good crops of hay.-The air is
pure and healthy, although a great quantity of rain falls on
the hills and valleys, as is the case on all the west coast of
Scotland.  The rheumatism affects people of different ranks,
and in different situations, owing, no doubt, to the moisture
and variableness of the climate.

   Rivers, Lakes, Sea-coast, etc.-The river Cur has its
source in the mountains that border on Lochgoilhead; for
2 miles it is rough and rapid; when it comes down to
the plain, it runs smoothly, forming a number of beauti-
ful links.  After running about 7 miles, and receiving a
number of smaller rivers, it discharges itself into Locheck,
a lake of 6 miles in length, and 1/2 mile in breadth.  The
bound of the parish extend for 3 miles on each side of
this lake, which lies, thus far S. E. and N. W.; it then
forms a curve, turning S. and S. W.  A few salmon, and
a number of salmon-trout, come up this lake by the river
Eachaig, which communicates with the Clyde.  They are
caught by angling.  A still net has been tried on the lake
with some success, but not enough to defray the expense
of attendance.  The salmon come up the river Cur in
October and November, and remain through a great part
of the winter; very few in summer.  This was not the
case some time ago.  It would appear the salmon is not
so plenty in the rivers since still nets have become so nu-
merous on the coast.  The most remarkable thing with
regard to *Locheck is, its abounding with fresh water

* There is an old tradition in the parish regarding the origin of Loch-
eck.  It is said, the space it occupies was once a beautiful flat of arable
land.  The lake is now very deep; in many places from 60 to 70 fathoms.
The people in its neighbourhood account it the deepest of any in Scot-
land.
