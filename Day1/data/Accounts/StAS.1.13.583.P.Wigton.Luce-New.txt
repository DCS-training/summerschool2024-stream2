"flower or herb."  The reason why the two parishes, be-
fore their disjunction, obtained the name of Glenluce, may
be owing to this, that the land on each side the river Luce
rises high, and is adorned with a great variety of plants,
forming, what in this country is called a glen, besides that,
there are considerable tracts of rich holm adjoining to the
river; hence, when compared with the land that is contigu-
ous to it, which formerly was mostly covered with heath,
it abounded with a greater variety of plants.  It is of an ir-
regular figure, about 10 English miles in lenght, and from
5 to 6 in breadth; is bounded by Old Luce on the S. and
S. E.; by Kirkcowan on the E. and N. E.; by Colmonell 
on the N. Balantrae on the W. and by the Inch on the
S. W.  It consists partly of high and low land.  The ara-
ble land is but little, when compared to its extent; the 
greater part of the high land being covered with rocks,
heath, or with a mossy surface; and on part of it grows a
coarse kind of grass called sprett, which is cut by the far-
mers for hay.  The greater part of the arable land lies a
long the banks of the rivers.

   Rivers,etc.-Two small rivers run through part of the
parish, one named Luce-water, which forms the boundary
betweeu it and Ballantrae, and for a considerable way be-
tween it and the Inch:  The other river is named the Cross
water, which runs N. and S. through the middle of the upper
part of the parish, and empties itself into Luce-water, a little
below where the church stands.  A considerable quantity of
salmon is annually caught in both rivers, but in greatest
quantity in Luce-river.  The common way of taking them 
here, is with an instrument called a leister, the beds of the
rivers being so rocky as not to admit of their being
draughted with nets, except only in a few places.  They 
seldom have it in their power to kill salmon in perfection.
