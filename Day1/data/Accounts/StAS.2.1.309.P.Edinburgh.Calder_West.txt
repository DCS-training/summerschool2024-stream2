for forty years, a Dissenting meeting-house in the village, be-
longing to the United Secession. The inhabitants adhered to
the church in about the proportion of sixteen to eleven.
   Education.-The parish school has generally attending it from
50 to 90 scholars. The teacher has a good house and garden.
The salary is the maximum.  The probable yearly amount of fees
paid to the parochial schoolmaster is about L. 15 or L. 16. The
other emoluments may probably amount to from L. 35 to L. 40.
There is another school in the village, attended by about the same
number of children as the parish school; but, as the teacher de-
pends chiefly on the school fees for a living, he must be very poorly
supported. There is likewise a school four miles west of the vil-
lage, attended by a great number of children.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The funds for supplying the poor
of this parish, arose formerly from the weekly collections from the
mortcloth money, from the sum of 2s. 6d. given at each marriage,
and from the interest of a bond for L. 100. The following table
shows the rate of collections for six months in the summer and
autumn: In 1743, L. 5, 11s. 1d.; in 1773, L. 6, 3s. 9d.; in 1783,
L. 10, 10s. 1 1/2 d.; in 1793, L. 9, 16s. 5d.; in 1794, L. 10, 8s. 4d.
The number of those who received charity from the poor's funds
during the above years, were from 10 to 15, and the sum given to
each was at an average of 3s. per month.

   The highest sum given to any pauper on the roll, is at present
at the rate of L. 7, 4s. yearly, and the lowest L. 1, 10s. The
average of the present collections is about 5s. 9d. weekly. The
mortcloth has almost ceased to be of any value to the poor's fund
as it is very seldom used.
