   Church, Stipend, etc.-The King is patron.  The church
was built in 1779, at a considerable expense, and is a most
substantial and commodious edifice, superior to most, and
inferior to few places of worship in the country.  The sti-
pend is L. 50 money, 16 bolls of meal, at 9 stone; 8
bolls of bear, with L. 2: 15: 6 1/12, communion-element
money.  The glebe is scarcely legal; but part of it, parti-
cularly the garden, is valuable.  The incumbent is accom-
modated with a farm, otherwise the glebe and offices would
not render the settlement very convenient.  The manse,
for years, has been as insufficient as any in the country.
The sum of L. 269 is allowed foregiving it a thorough repair,
and for building a good addition, which, if properly ap-
plied, and the work sufficiently executed, must render the
manse abundantly commodious.
