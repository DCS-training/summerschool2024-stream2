ment seasons have run them into arrear of rent.  This hangs
over, and much dispirits them.  Were this passed from but in
part, it would give new life to their endeavours.-Tradition
says, that some of the hills in Cairny were once covered
with slately oaks.  Now they present their nakedness to e-
very passenger.  Not one tree has been planted here for 60
years, though the river and burn-sides are favourable to their
growth.  Hard wood is scarce, which will hurt both the far-
mer and manufacturer.-Good roads (which was the foun-
dation of the prosperity of the youth country), are unknown
here.  Our moss is exhausted, The people must go to Port-
soy for coals, by a road swarming with bogs and stones.-In
the statistical account of this country, the manufacturing vil-
lages of Huntly and Keith should never be forgot.  They
are the sources of much riches.  They pay a great part of
the landholders rent.  Huntly promises to be the Paisley
of the north.  Here is a large importation of flax from
Holland and Flanders.  Here are bleachfields, weaving lin-
ens and cotton; threads for Nottingham, It may be laid
that 500 L. weekly is in circulation for many months of
the year.  The town is increasing.  The Duke of Gordon,
he proprietor, is yearly giving off new feus.  The town
of Huntly is thriving amidst many difficulties.  Portsoy,
their sea-port, is 15 miles distant.  Thence they bring their
fuel, though the road is many times almost impassable.

   Manufactures are of great importance in any country,
and should always be encouraged.  They enlarge our
views, and introduce a spirit of liberty.  A manufacturer
has always more liberal notions than a farmer,
   The manufacturer of linen has introduced a certain clean-
liness over all this country.  It has almost banished the itch.
On a holiday, or at a fair, it is pleasant to behold the peo-
ple well dressed, showing away in their clean linen and
thread-stockings.
