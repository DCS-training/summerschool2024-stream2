considerable extent, but good for pasture.  In Isle Muck
there are a few creeks, which afford shelter to small boats;
but no safe harbour for vessels.  In two of these creeks are
piers in an imperfect state.

   Air and Climate-The air is generally moist, and the wea-
ther rainy.  The southerly and westerly winds, which are
the most frequent, are almost constantly attended with rain.
It is remarked by the inhabitants, that the seasons are still
becoming more and more rainy.  For a few years past, even
the winters have been attended with rain, instead of the usual
snow and srost.  The last summer and harvest, 1793, were
much more rainy than any remembered, which is the more
singular, as the weather was said to be very dry in the low
lands of Scotland, and favourable even within 50 miles to the
eastward.  These rains make the grain crops precarious, and
of little value, though they have, for some time, a promising
appearance.  The climate, however, is healthy; the causes
may be, that there is no considerable body of stagnant wa-
ters; the good quality of the waters in most of these islands,
and the pure sea air which the inhabitants always breathe.-
The diseases, which most commonly appear in this parish,
are the continued fever, croup, erysipelas, measles, catarrh,
pleurisy, epilepsy, hooping cough, diarrhoea, dropsy of the
belly, and jaundice.  Of these the most fatal are the croup,
pleurisy, and hooping cough.  About two years ago, the
croup proved very mortal, and swept away many childen,
some of them about 9 or 10 years of age.
