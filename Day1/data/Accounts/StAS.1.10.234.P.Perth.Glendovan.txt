     Statistical Account

   The road which forms the principal communication between
Strathern and Blairngone, has lately been made more accessi-
ble than formerly, and should the plan, now proposed, for the
improvement of it, be executed, such an easy passage through
such a chain of mountains would scarcely be equalled.

   The practice of dismissing the cottars and small tenants, is
attended with some disadvantages here.  By this practice, the
farmers often find it very difficult to procure hands to ex-
ecute any work, which occurs at a particular season of the
year, and continues but for a fhort time, and the nursery for
labouring servants is cut off; for the children brought up in
the country, are much more healthy and robust, not to men-
tion other circumstances, and make better labouring servants
than those brought up in towns.  A woollen manufacture might
be established in this place, or the neighbourhood, with ad-
vantage.  It would be supplied with wool from the Ochills
and the West Highlands, which are at no great distance.  For
such a purpose, a convenient situation might easily be found,
on the Dovan, which would afford a constant supply of water.
