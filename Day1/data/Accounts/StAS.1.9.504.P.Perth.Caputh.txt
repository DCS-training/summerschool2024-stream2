the name of Scrimns and Silesias.  Formerly, not above
one third of what was stamped was manufactured in the 
parish; but during the two last years, the parish manufac-
tured about one half of the quantity stamped.  Besides the 
above quantities, and without reckoning 12,000 yards and 
upwards, annually made for household use, there are about
20,000 yards manufactured in the parish, which are stamp-
ed at Blairgowrie or Dunkeld.

   Antiquities.,-About a mile and a half north-west from
the church, in a very elevated situation, there is a small
Druidical circle.  Beside it are two large stones, deeply sunk
in the ground; the top of the lowest is artificially formed
into an inclined plane, facing the south, and contains a
number of small cavities; which may have been used by
the Druids in the performance of religious rites.  Near the 
church, there are the remains of a cairn. where probably a 
cross had been erected during the prevalence of Popish su-
perstition; the place still retaining the name of Cross-cairn.
Cairnmure is the largest cairn in this country, being 456
feet in circumference, and 18 feet high.  It has been lately
surrounded with a row of trees and a stone wall.  Above 
half a mile south-west from this, stands another, 357 feet
in circumference, and 14 feet high.  In a line with these
two, and at the same distance, there is a third, of a smaller
size.  The top of the craig at Stenton, a mile west from
the church, bears evident marks of having been a fortified
spot.  It is called Kemp's Hold, or the Soldier's Fastness.
Some fragments of weapons were dug up about 16 years
ago, when it was planted with trees.  It has a very pictu-
