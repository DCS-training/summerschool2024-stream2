it were agreeable to his Lordship to erect better houses, and to
build a harbour at the shore, which it is believed, would not
be attended with a great expense, Cullen would perhaps be
one of the most comfortable and convenient places in the
north of Scotland to live in.

   Antiquities.-At the north end of the town of Cullen, there
is a beautiful green hill, called the Castle-hill, hanging over
the sea, which before the use of cannon, was extremely well
situated for a place of strength, being inaccessible from the
north by an almost perpendicular high rock, and having a
deep ditch in all other directions for its defence.  There is no
record concerning it, when, or by whom built, or when de-
stroyed; but it is evident from the calcined stones dug every
where, that it has been destroyed by fire.  And the only tra-
dition concerning it is, that the town of Cullen lay at the
east side of it, and when an enemy appeared, the inhabitants
carried their most valuable effects into the castle for protec-
tion; but when the castle was burned, that the inhabitants
removed to the present situation of the town, to be under the
protection of the constable at Cullen house, the residence of
the Earl of Findlater.  Near Cullen house, there is the vestige
of a house, in which, it is said, Queen Elizabeth, Queen of
King Robert Bruce died.  In the annexed part of the parish
of Rathven, there is the ruin of a chapel at Farskane, upon
the sea bank, which is supposed to have been a Chapel of
Ease in the perish of Rathven, and worship was probably per-
formed there by the clergymen from Cullen.
