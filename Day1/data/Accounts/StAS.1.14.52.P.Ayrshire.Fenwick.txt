road which runs through that town from Glasgow to
Ayr, and almost at an equal distance from these two
places.  The parish is about 9 miles long from E. to
W., and 6 miles broad.  When the disjunction took
place, it was considered as the moorland part of the pa-
rish of Kilmarnock, and the soil in every part is mossy.
In the lower part of the parish, however, the lands are
tolerably good; and, in favourable seasons, yield not 
unfruitful crops of oats and bear, the only grain that is
sown here; when there is an open winter, as it is call-
ed, and the following summer is dry and warm, the
crops are the best.  Long continued frost in winter, and
rainy summers, are exceedingly hurtful.  The corns,
in many parts of the parish, are seldom fully ripened,
and seldom yield meal for corn.  This depends, how-
ever, much on their situation, either near the moors, or
downward towards Kilmarnock or Dreghorn, where the
lands are the best.  The air is far from being unhealthy.
We cannot be said to have any diseases peculiar to the 
place.  From their situation, the grounds must be damp,
and the air moist, but no bad effects follow.  Some
years ago, a fever prevailed in the village of Fenwick,
but did not extend much farther.  For many years, the 
small pox had not been in the parish but in a few scat-
tered families.  About the beginning of the last year,
1792, they began to make their appearance.  They went
through every corner of the bounds, and the numbers
that had them were great; but they were very favour-
able.  It was half a year before one died, and only 3
died in all.  It is almost unnecessary to add, that they
all had them in the natural way.  The prejudices
against inoculation are great.  Some even deem it a sin
to give children any thing by way of preparation.
