rish. These, together with thd trees about the houses of the prin-
cipal proprietors and some of the farm-steadings, constitute almost
the whole of the wood in the parish,--so that, upon the whole, it
is but scantily supplied with this important article in rural scenery.

                       II.--CIVIL HISTORY.

mediate neighbourhood of the town is in small properties or feus,

	Historical Notices.--There are no printed histories of Montrose,
except such `s are to be found in Encyclopaedias, Gazetteers, &c.
