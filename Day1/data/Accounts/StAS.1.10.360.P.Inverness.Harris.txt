     Statistical Account

of the manure formerly afforded by the shores.  All the sea-
ware, now used for manure, is such as is cast ashore after the
kelp-making season is past.  In dry weather, any time from
the month of April to the month of September, kelp may be
made of every weed which the sea produces.  The people
of Harris are very expert and industrious at it.  The whole
quantity now made amounts to 450 tons.  The shores are
held in tack along with the landed possession.  The manu-
facturers are paid at the rate of so much per ton, according
to the different situations and disadvantages of the shores.
For the easiest shores the least paid is 1 L. 5 s.; for the more
difficult form 1 L. 10 s. to 1 L. 15 s. per ton.  For manu-
facturing such ware as is cut at low ebbs on sunk rocks,
which must be ferried in boats to drying grounds at a
distance, there is in some instances paid from 2 L. 10 s. to
3 L. per ton.  The introduction of this manufacture, exclu-
sive of its advantages to the tacksmen, has been a great bles-
sing to the poorer tenantry, who, in the summer quarter,
have no other object on which their industry can be profit-
ably exerted.  Yet its benefit does not extend to them so far
as might be wished; as every kelp dealer is desirous to have
his kelp made as early as possible, (that which is made early
being always the best,) the taskmen, for the sake of expedit-
ing the manufacture, portions out his shores in small lots to
as many manufacturers as he can find; so that for the most
part, the man who gets more than a ton for his lot may
reckon himself lucky.  In the South Isles, and in a few other
situations, where the people have summer grazing for their
cattle, a man, assisted by his family, may make 4 or 5 tons
in a season.  We recko 350 hands employed in this work,
which, in a dry season, they finish in the course of 5 or 6
weeks.  The employer supplies them in meal, at as easy a
rate as it can be purchased; and were it not that in a season
