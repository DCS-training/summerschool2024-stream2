   Soil, Produces etc.-The soil varies from a strong clay to
a rich black mould, the only exceptions being a few haughs,
(evidently formed by the changing of the river's course),
composed of a light earth and deep sand.  In a few places,
the clay land is extremely wet, and difficult to labour; but
the whole of the parish is arable, and has been, for time im-

sent high state of cultivation, it is evident that attention to
agriculture was early introduced; and it is a well attested
fact, that Lord Stair was the first in Scotland to plant tur-
nips and cabbages in the open fields.  All the lands in the
parish have been long ago enriched with lime; and many
attempts were made, though with less success, to lime a se-

quantity of dung; and some of the farmers have carried

white crops, but also to varying the different crops in the
rotation.

assistance from oxen.  The ploughs are after Small's con-
