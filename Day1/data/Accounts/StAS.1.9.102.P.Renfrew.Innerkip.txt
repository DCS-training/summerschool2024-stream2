outside is a walk for white-work of the same length.-In
the neighbourhood of this village an attempt was made for
coal some years ago, which, if successful, would have been
of great advantage to the country; but meeting with cop-
per ore, the undertakers were diverted from their first ob-
ject.  This new discovery promised well both in richness
and quantity; but being wrought by a Company, who
were chiefly engaged in England, it was so managed as to
defeat the expectation.-On Sir Michael's estate are 3
mills, 2 for grinding corn, and 1 for dressing flax.  On Mr
Darroch's estate are 2, 1 for extracting oil from lintseed,
and the other for washing materials belonging to the rope-
work Company.-There are 18 public-houses, greatest part
of which might easily be wanted; however, it does not ap-
pear that they are very hurtful to the morals of the peo-
ple.  Only 2 of these have a licence for all kinds of li-
quors.-During the summer months, this place is much
frequented for sea-bathing; a number of houses are kept
mostly furnished on purpose, and hired by families from
Glasgow, and other inland places, which is of great advan-
tage to the inhabitants.-The fish caught here, are the same
with those round the west coast of Scotland; and there are
no sea-fowls, nor land-animals, so remarkable as to deserve
particular description.-The inhabitants in general are in
easy circumstances, sober and industrious
