    lowing, and wheat or barley is sown after it. One-half of tur-
    nips is generally led off to fatten cattle kept in the stall, and the
    other half eaten with sheep in the field. The farms are generally
    large, and let on leases of nineteen years. The tenantry are most
    respectable, -possessed of capital, -well-skilled in their profession,
    -and enterprising. The great obstacle with which they have to
    contend is the distance from lime and manure; but such is their
    spirit, that great quantities of lime are regularly brought from
    the neighbourhood of Etal, a carriage of thirty miles. As a substi-
    tute for manure, bone dust has been introduced into pretty general
    use for the last four or five years, and by this means the bulk of
    turnip crop has been materially increased. Within the last twen-
    ty years, the lands on Nisbet side have been enclosed with hedge-
    rows of thorn.
	Produce. -The average gross amount of produce yearly raised
    in the parish is as follows:

			V. -PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

	There are three villages, or rather hamlets, in this parish,-
    Crailing, Nisbet, and Upper Nisbet.  The village of Crailing was
    at one time considerable, but within the last forty years has been
    diminishing,many of the houses having been taken down. There are
    no small feuars; all the houses belong to the proprietors of the land.
    	Means of Communication. -The road from Hawick to Kelso,
    forming part of the great road from Carlisle to Berwick, passes
    through Crailing village. Its course through the parish for nearly
    two and a-half miles is agreeably shaded on either side by a row
    of forest trees, consisting of beech, ash, and elm intermingled.
    During the summer 1833, a great and much-wanted improvement
    has been effected by the construction of an elegant bridge across
    the Oxnam. Previous to this new erection, almost the whole pas-
    sage was through a ford, which was frequently unpleasant from the
    increase of the stream by rain, though seldom dangerous. There
    was, indeed, an old bridge; but, in consequence of being conside-
    rably above the direct line, and of inconvenient access, it was little
