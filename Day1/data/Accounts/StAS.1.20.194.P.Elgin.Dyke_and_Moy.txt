parishes of Kinlofs and Forrefs; north of Edinkellie; and
east of the parish of Auldearn and county of Nairn.  It is
an irregular four-cornered figure, running up the Frith for
about 6 miles along shore, from that corner oppposite to Fin-
dern harbour, till it reaches the mouth of the Ellands Bourne,
over against the opening into Cromart Bay.  From thence
another of its boundaries stretches up through the easter end
of the Hardmoor*, in a southerly direction, for a great way
into another heath, called the Broad Shaw.  This boundary,
from the shore, separates the barony of Brodie and Torres-
try lands, in this parish, from the lands of Inshough, Bog-
hole, and Moynes, in the parish of Auldearn, and county
of Nairn.  The other boundaries are too irregular for de-
scription.

   Extent and Contents.-The superficial extent of this irre-
gular figure may be about 21 square miles; containing
2697 Scots acres of corn-field, 1191 acres of natural and
planted wood, and the rest in pasture, heath, and exhausted
mosses, with a sandy desert all along the shore; which desert
is a full half of the whole contents.  There are evident marks
of an early population in different places of this extensive
and deserted track, which has been entirely flat, till over-
whelmed by sand from the sea.  On the outside of this
sandy desert there is a high bank, which may be traced al-

*Where this boundary crosses she heath called the Hardmoor, there lies
somewhere a solitary spot of classic ground, unheeded here, but much re-
nowned in Drury, for the Thane of Glammis's interview with the Wayward
or Weird Sisters, in what some editions call the Harmore icene of the tra-
gedy of Macbethe.  Here the inventive genius of Shakespeare, so predomi-
nant in the supernatural and sublime, catching the hint from old tradition,
has conjured up a night-piece of infernal horror, well adapted to suggest
the hellish purpose, and forward the bloody work, that set the Usurper on
the throne.
