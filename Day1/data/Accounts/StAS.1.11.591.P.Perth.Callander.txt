though the very act of looking down, when there is a flood in
the water, must fill the head of a stranger with a swimming gid-
diness, owing to the altitude of his situation, the deafening
roar of the torrent, the gloomy horror of the glen, and the
whirling of the pool below, into which the cascade falls, rol-
ling, tossing, thundering down.

   Cove.-There is a large cove in a mountain, on the confines
of the parishes of Callander and Kilmadock, where lawless peo-
ple used to hide themselves, after committing depredations on
the adjacent country.  The mountain itself is called Uah Vor,
i.e.  The Great Cove; but the description of it is left to the
account of Kilmadock parish.

   Climate and Longevity-The air is falubrious in a very
high degree.  There are no local distempers; and people live
to a very great age.  A woman died lately, who was said to
have been 101 years of age.  A man is still alive, who is 99,
and tolerably vigorous.  A few years ago, he was able to earn
his bread, by driving a horse and cart, and carrying lime to the
farmers in the neighbourhood.  Several married people have,
of late, lived together near 60 years.  Some of these are still
alive.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants in the different
farms, was greater about half a century ago than it is now;
yet the general population of the parish is daily increasing,
owing to the enlargement of particular villages+.
