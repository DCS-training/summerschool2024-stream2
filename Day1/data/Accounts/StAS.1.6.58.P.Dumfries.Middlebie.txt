     NUMBER VII.

     PARISH OF MIDDLEBIE.

     (PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD AND COUNTY OF
     DUMFRIES.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ABRAHAM NIVISON.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   MIDDLEBIE consists of three parishes, Middlebie, Pen-
nersaughs, and Carruthers, now united into one.  In
the Saxon language, Bie or Bee, it is said, signifies a station;
and the addition, Middle, has been given to this place from
the circumstance of being the middle station between Nether-
bie in Cumberland, and Overbie, or Upperbie, in Eskdale-
muir; at both which places, as well as at Middlebie, are
plain vestiges of a Roman work.-This district is 9 miles
in length, and 4 1/2 in breadth, though of a very irregular form,
intersected in some places by the neighbouring parishes.
The surface is slat, with gently rising hills interspersed.  The
soil is very various; mostly strong, deep, and wet, upon a
cold tilly bed, but fertile upon the whole.  The air is general-
ly moist:  After a long course of rainy weather, putrid fevers
prevail much.
