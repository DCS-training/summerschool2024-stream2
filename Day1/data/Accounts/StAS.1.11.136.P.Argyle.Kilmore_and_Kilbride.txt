stocked with inhabitants, consisting of tenants and cottagers.
The rents being then very moderate, the people lived com-
fortably in their line, though on simple fare, and in homely
clothing.  But, since that period, the rents have been doubled,
pay, in some parts tripled; and many of their possessions have
been taken by the more opulent: The lower tenants were, of
course, obliged to remove and shift for themselves.  The aged,
the feeble, and the poorer sort, became cottagers; but the
most vigorous, and by far the greatest number, engaging in
the public works, which were carrying on over the country
to a very great extent, found means to subsist more comfort-

living, (particularly of the workmen and servants), more
especially of the younger sort, many of them have arrived at
such a pitch of gaiety in the one, and of expence in the other,
that their circumstances would appear to be much improved:
But there is reason to believe, the change is more to be a-
scribed to their advance in luxury, than in opulence.  It de-
serves, however, to be remarked, that the old tenants have
hardly made any alteration in their manner of living.  The
excursions made to the Low Country, by the labourers and
servants, may account, in a good measure, for their advance-

ship is particularly felt from the demands of household ser-
vants, whose high wages have become an intolerable griev-
ance.  On account of their frequent intercourse with the Low
Country, they very soon learn the English language, inso-
