ployed 12 looms in that work, and produced carpets of very
fine colour, and the very best quality.  Another company
employs about 8 looms:  and this year a third company has
begun work, and mean to employ not lets than 12 looms.
There are in all betwixt 30 end 40 looms constantly employ-
ed.  The dyers are reckoned eminently skilled in their pro-
session, and the colouring of the Stirling carpets is allowed to
be very fine.
   The cotton manufacture also begins to take place here.
Three companies from Glasgow give out cotton yarn to be
woven, and one of them have about 40 little girls engaged at
the tambour.  Another company have this year got jennies;
and though erected only at Whitsunday last, are just now em-
ploying 50 looms to spin their own yarn.  Near 100 persons,
young and old, are already employed by this new company.
There may be in all 260 looms employed in weaving coarse
muslin.  Wool spinning is likewise carried on to a consider-
able extent.  There are above 100 employed by one master
in this work, in teasing, scouring, and combing the wool, and
making it ready for the wheel.
   The river Forth runs so level in the neighbourhood of Stir-
ling, that mills cannot be erected for the purpose of manu-
factures.  In every other respect, Stirling is favourable for
them.  Coals are plentiful; the rents of houses are low, and
Wages very moderate*.
