date or inscription, having only upon the side of it a number of
circles, inscribed within one another, of a very rough sculpture.
It was probably set up in the antient market place, as a badge
of municipal jurisdiction.  Of the same nature, was a tall
wooden post, with two cross arms affixed to it, and an iron
collar, for encircling the necks of affenders, called the Jougs,
suspended by a chain at the side of it, which stood on a stone
pedestal in a public part of the present town*.  It was called 
the Trone, and goods sold in the public market were weighed
at it.  It was taken down about ten years ago, being thought
an incumbrance on the street.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The Scottish dialect is spoken here
with very little provincial peculiarity.  The names of most pla-
ces are derived from that language; but a few have a Celtic o-
rigin, such as Earnock or Earnogg, the old son's possession.
Darn galer, the house or village between the waters, etc.-
The wild quadrupeds here are the same as in the neighbouring
country; neither are there any uncommon birds.  Eagles are
seldom seen.  Rooks abound greatly, and are very injurious
to the husbandman.  It may be observed, that the bulsinch,
which is said to be a new bird in Scotland, is known to have
hatched in this parish, more than forty years ago.  The wood-
lark is frequent in this part of the country.  On the approach
of snow, great flocks of small birds of the migratory species,
and of vast variety of plumage, spread over the fields.  They
are here called snow-flights; and are said to come from the
Orkneys.  It has been observed, that, in blowing weather, in
spring and autumn, great quantities of gulls pass this way to
the westward, but have never been seen to go east by the same
rout.
