morial; in which necessary of life they have been greatly re-
stricted by the proprietors of mosses in both parishes, as to
quantity, during the last period of seven years.  Notwith-
standing, there remains an inexhaustible fund of that article
in this district; at least, conjecture itself is at a loss to as-
certain the number of centuries which the mosses in the i-
slands of Stronsay and Eday would supply their inhabitants
with such annual quantities of peats as they were accustom-
ed to provide for their families, before such restrictions were
imposed ^.

   The proprietors of peat moss in the island of Eday have been pleased,
for some years last past, with a view to save their mosses, to prevent the
meanest of the inhabitants, their own small tenants, sub-tenants, cott???s, or
delvers of their little spots of ground, to boil certain quantities of what they
call salt, (of a mean quality, it must be acknowledged,) over the only fire
burnt in their cottages, which fire is used also for all culinary purposes.  The
whole quantities of peat, to supply which fires, are so inconsiderable as to be
carried home by the indignent tenants of these cottages, on their backs in
creels or cases made with straw; the extra quantity required for the said pur-
pose must be small indeed!  This salt, such as it was, used to be carried in
small parcels by the makers of it to other neighbouring islands, where they
received from the poorest of the inhabitants, who could not afford to purchase
salt of a good quality, equal quantities of meal for the salt which they
brought.  By such traffic, the poor people of Eday procured, in a very labo-
rious way, a scanty supply of meal for their families in the winter season,
when the stormy weather did not permit their going a fishing, on which
business many in this island depend chiefly for daily bread.  This restric-
tion has induced some, and, if not removed, or some other remedy provided,
will probably induce many more of these poor families to migrate to other
islands, if not to other countries.
   The whole mosses in the island of Stronsay belong to the proprietor of
Rothesholm, from which mosses the whole inhabitants of this island, for
time immemorial, have supplied their families with peats, upon making small
acknowledgements, in money or other articles, to the tenant of Rothesholm.
This practice continued to the mutual satisfaction of the inhabitants, and of
