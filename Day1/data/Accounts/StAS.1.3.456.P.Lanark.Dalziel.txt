white covering, here alone a mild verdure appears.  The 
banks of the Clyde, all along this parish, are low, with fine
vallies or meadows along the side of the river, except in one
place, where there is a bold rocky bank for about 300 or 400
yards.  Upon the top of this bank, the father of the present 
proprietor, apprehended, from the vestige of a trench, inclos-

dross of a smith's forge.  Mr Hamilton also cleared the face

seats at advantageous situations, and planting various kinds of 
fruit and forest trees, where ever they could be admitted;
and in the year 1789, the fruit on this hitherto unprofitable
spot, was sold for 30 l. Sterling.

   The banks of the Calder are beautifully diversified with
coppices and sloping glades; and upon the east corner of the 
parish, become boldly rocky and romantic.  On these banks
