above day-labourers, and the poorer class of mechanics and
farmers; may, raised them to an equality with the more opu-

whom their employment their manners, and prospects in
life, procured them a degree of respect very advantageous to
their protection.
   Ninety years have produced such a change, and so great
improvements, in the agriculture, navigation, commerce, arts,
and riches of this country, that 15 L. sterling per annum, at
the end of the last century, may be considered as a better
income than 45 L. sterling per annum at this present time.
   Suppose, then, that in Scotland there are 900 parochial
schoolmasters, which is very near the truth; 800 of these
will be found struggling with indigence, inferior in point of
income to 800 day-labourers in the best cultivated parts of
this island and receiving hardly half the emoluments of the
menial servant of country gentlemen and wealthy citizens.
   It seems a reproach to the enlightened minds and enlarged
views of the present age, that nine hundred of their fellow
citizens, selected to form the tempers and characters of a
million, by conveying to them the fist principles of litera-
ture, morality, and religion, should in the last century have
been placed in a respectable station, possessing, not merely
necessaries, but comforts and conveniencies; and, by the pro-
gress of improvements, which they themselves have been the
means of introducing, that so many of their successors, cho-
sen, like them, out of the great body of the people, to form
the minds and manners of more than a million and a half
of their fellow subjects to the love of justice, temperance, in-
tegrity, industry, and every virtue, and likewise to instruct
them in the rudiments of useful literature-should, in this
