     Statistical Account

bounded by the parish of Morton; on the S.W. by Pen-
pont; on the W.N.W. and N. by Sanquhar; and on the
N.E. and E. by Crawford.  Its general appearance with-
in the range of hills is flat; but on the banks of the Nith
there is a good deal of steep ground.  The Nith is fordable
only in two or three places.  There is a stone-bridge of
three arches over it, near the foot of the parish.  Carron, a 
fine clear rivulet, rising at the foot of the Lowthers, runs
several miles down the E. side of the parish, then divides
it from Morton, falls into Nith at Carron foot, and hath
many acres of arable land, with a gentle declivity on its
banks.-The soil, in general, is deep and fertile; in many
places inclining to a reddish colour, and this colour increases
in proportion to the height of the hills.  The  most remark-
able mountains in the parish are the Lowthers, from the
top of which, in a clear day, there is a most extensive and 
variegated prospect.  The hills are partly covered with
heath, partly with verdure, and a strong kind of grass call-
ed Bent.  They are pastured with fine flocks of sheep of
the short kind, as that species has hitherto been considered
the most proper for the situation.-Freestone of various
kinds is found.  In several places there is the appearance
of coal; and it is thought that some of the hills contain
lead, as the mines of Leadhills and Wanlockhead are on
the other side of the Lowthers.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's returns, the
numbers were 1019.  It is highly probable that this parish
was  more populous about the beginning of this century than
at present.  One or 2 tenants now possess places formerly
occupied by several families.  The parish now contains
1031 souls.  There are only 2 villages; 1 containing about
100 persons, and another about 50.
