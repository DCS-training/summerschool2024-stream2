	In the year 1771, it was, according to	Dr Walker, 1900

	By the census taken in January 1837,	           4011 souls.*
The annual average number of marriages for the five years im-
mediately preceding 1827, was about 2 1, while the same (owing
to the adoption of salutary checks, which will be afterwards ad-
verted to,) does not exceed 6 for the last twelve months. The
average number of individuals in each family is 5 2/3 nearly.
  In the two districts attached to Kilniuir church, there were 421
families in January 1837, and only 190 divisions of land, in the
shape of lots, crofts, and farms. 6f these 421 families, 231 held
no possessions whatever from the proprietor, but lived as a burden
and drawback on the occupiers of the 190 divisions, either in the
humble capacity of cottars, or as under tenants, who held shares
of the said 190 divisions under the baneful system of sub-letting.
As this process of sub-letting was annually progressing, the popu-
lation, as a matter of course, was rapidly increasing, until it accu-
mulated to an amount by far too large for being comfortably sup-
ported by the produce or agricultural returns of the parish.
Hence the origin of a redundant population; and while that re-
dundancy is permitted to continue, destitution and poverty, toge-
ther with a train of concomitant evils, will be the sure but UDbap-
py results.
From what has been stated, it will be seen, that, during the last six-

<FOOTNOTE>It Will be observed that there is an apparent increase of 596 souls in the parish
in the six years between 1831 and 1837; but it is only apparent, as the census of
1831, by being taken'in summer was under the real amount of population, as many
were Out of the country in quest of employment, whowere not taken into the account.
The time of the year in whi h the census is taken has a material effect on the results
arrived at. If taken.in the summer months, manyof the inhabitants are out of the

in tied summer season is sure to give incorrect returns, unless the Government regula-
tions in regard to the census were deviated from, so far as to include the absent iFnern-
bers, of the several families.
