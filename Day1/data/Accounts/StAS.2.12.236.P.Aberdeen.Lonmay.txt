per cost, it would be found to be much dearer than (as it is certainly
a much inferior fuel to) sea-borne coal.

                      MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATICONS.
   The principal changes in the state of this parish since the last
Statistical Account was published, consist, I. In the great extent
of agricultural improvements: 1st, On waste ladd reclaimed: 2d,
Wet land drained: 3d, In very extensive and substantial enclosures:
4th, In an improved system of cropping, of breeding stock, and ge-
neral management: 5th, In additional plantations, which now begin
highly to adorn the face, especially of the northern half of the pa-
rish: 6th, In the increased value of the land, the total rental being
nearly treble of what it was in 1796.  II. In the provision made
for the intellectual improvement of the people, which is vastly in-
creased.  III. In the additional accommodation for the worship of
God, by an additional church and preacher.  IV. In the external
comforts of the people, as to lodging, neatness of dress, and others
which meet the eye.  But then, an the other side of the picture, is
to be noted, straitened circumstances of late years, and want of ca-
pital.  The tide of prosperity is at present ebbing, and credit is de-
creasing as well as cash.  There is a decreased currency, and low
prices for produce,-but high rents, high charges for labour and
implements, and a heavy charge for wear and tear on the farm
accounts.  Great industry and the greatest possible frugality are
requisite to obtain the means of bare subsistence.
