   Miscellaneous Observations.-This district is at a great di-
stance from coal.  A good deal of peat is used for fuel.  At-
tempts have been made to find coal in the parish, but have
not as yet been successful, it is thought, for want of per-
severance.-There are several inclosures, and less ground
in tillage than in former times.  The farmers rear and sell
a considerable number of sheep.  A considerable quantity
of potatoes and turnip is raised here.  Several good farm-
houses have been lately erected.-There is a tumulus in the
N. E. side of the parish, another in the parish of Coulter,
and a third in the parish of Lamington, all in a line west-
ward, and about the distance of 3 miles from one another.
They might serve as signals, by means of torches, along an
extended plain, when hostilities subsisted between England
and Scotland.  The English lay encamped on the hill of
Corscrine, in this parish, before the battle of Biggar.
