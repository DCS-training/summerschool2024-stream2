	Modern Buildings.--Among the modern buildings, the only one
worthy of notice is the new church, opened for public worship on
the 2d day of August 1829. The old church, after having stood
upwards of six centuries, was found to be both inconvenient and
unsafe, and was taken down in 1827, and the present church erected
on the same site. It is built of red freestone, chiefly in the Go-
thic style. It stands in the centre of the town, surrounded by the
churchyard, which is used as the public burial-ground. On the
east end of the church stands the tower, about 90 feet in height,
and ornamented on the top with turrets. The inside of the church
is plain, containing enclosed pews. The galleries are supported
by slight cast-iron pillars. The pulpit is highly ornamented. The
whole is well lighted. It is reckoned the most elegant church in
this part of the country.
			III.--POPULATION.
	The population in 1755, according to Dr Webster, was 1169.
Since that time it has been gradually increasing. The cause of the
increase is not very obvious. It may arise in part from the impor-
tation of Irish, and partly from the encouragement given to weaving
in this part of the country, by the Glasgow, Paisley, and Kilmar-
Nock manufactories.
