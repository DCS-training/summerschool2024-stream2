with a liberal supply during every season of the year.  Sal-
mon, trout, herring, cod, ling, haddock, whiting, mackarel,
halibut, which the fishers here call turbot, skate, flounder,
dog-fish, (from whose livers a great quantity of oil is extrac-

Messrss Selby, Cresswell, and Co. London, who now carry on
the fishery to a considerable extent.-The fishermen receive
quarterly the price of the fish they deliver, at the rate of
2d. for every cod, not below 12 inches in length.  Small as

crossing the Pentland Frith.  Several hundred of kits, contain-
ing each about 40 Lb. of salmon, are annually sent to Lon-
