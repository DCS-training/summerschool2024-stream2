ner of conducting it, or as to its success.  Their spirit of
enterprise makes them easily adopt a new plan, when fair-
ly recommended by its success; and their industry secures
their doing justice to any plan which they may adopt.
Free from the setters of prejudice, they follow, let the
leader be whom he will, if they are warranted by fair,
well tried, successful experiments.  That spirit has brought
this country to be able to support double or triple the
number of inhabitants, which it could have done 30 or 40
years ago.  A great deal of waste ground has been brought
under culture; and lands which then would have yielded
3 or 4 bolls an acre, now produce 8 or 10, and sometimes
more.  This is the case, more or less, with the country of
Strathmore, and in the county of Angus: I know no part
of the country where farming is carried on to greater per-
fection than in this very parish-Besides a great increase
in the quantity of corn, there is a considerable addition of
profit by the rearing and fattening of cattle.  Instead of
the stinted and famished breed, of which the farmer's store
consisted 40 years ago, cattle can now be reared to a con-
siderable size, and fetch a decent price, to compensate the
trouble and expense; fatted cattle generally sell well.  Our
farmers fatten through the winter, some 10, some 16, some
20, some 30 cattle.  Some of these are partly fed with tur-
nips, straw and hay; some with turnips and hay.  Such
as are fed wholly on turnips and hay, can be brought to
a degree of fatness, not exceeded in any part of Scotland.
The greatest part of our pasture and hay foggage is em-
ployed for the purpose of fattening.  Turnip crops keep
the land clean, and the great proportion of pasture gives
them vigour to produce good corn crops when broken up.
-There is a grievance, which, though in one view, it affects
but a single individual in a parish, yet is very extensive in
