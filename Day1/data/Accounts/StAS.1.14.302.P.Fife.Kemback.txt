causes are no doubt various.  One of the principal of
them, however, certainly is, the attention which several
of the gentlemen who reside on their estates have them-
selves paid to husbandry.  By introducing into the small
farms in their own possession the most approved system
of management for the different kinds of soil, they have
exhibited an example to their tenants, which, conspiring
with other causes, has produced the change of culture
mentioned above, a change no less beneficial to the pro-
prietor and tenant, than delighful to the judicious
spectator.

   For 2 or 4 years past, it has been the custom, in dif-
ferent parts of the parish, to raise potatoes from seed,

little doubt, that in this way these desirable ends will

which has been lately introduced, which promises to be 
a substantial and permanent benefit.  I mean, the use of
rutabaga, or Swedish turnip.  This plant is either sown
in the field, like common turnip, and treated in the same
manner, or town in a feed bed like cabbage, and trans-
planted at the distance of 10 or 12 inches in the drill.
In point of taste and flavour, it is greatly superior even

to turnip, it possesses some peculiar qualities which seem
to render it well calculated to serve in spring as a suc-
cedaneum to turnip, and to afford green food for cattle
till they can be put to grass.  It is considerable more
solid than common turnip.  Its specific gravity to that
of common turnip being nearly as 1013 to 878; (it may
be proper to mention, however, that the accuracy of
