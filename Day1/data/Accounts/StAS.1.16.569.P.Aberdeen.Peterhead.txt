   It will naturally be enquired how this should happen.
The first obstacle is prejudice; the second, poverty; the
third, manufactures; and the fourth, the heritors not re-
siding on their estates, granting proper leases, nor looking
out for some tenants of experience, enterprise, and wealth,
who might set an example to those around them.  The
greatest part of the tenants are natives of this parish, bred
as farmers by their parents, who, from the lowness of their
rents, were enabled to support their families, and pay their
rents with the old mode of farming; and they seldom think
of looking farther than the present time, to provide some-
thing for their family, or against any disaster that may be-
fal them; the rents have been raised, and with difficulty
are paid by the present tenants, not, in my opinion, by the
produce of their crops, but by the money received for ma-
nufactures by the females in their families, an accidental
high price for cattle for several years, and employing their
horses to lead peats to the town of Peterhead in summer,
when they might be more properly employed in following
a few acres of their farm, and carrying lime and dung.  The
truth is, a great part of the best land in this parish requires
a great deal of lime and dung, from the stiffness and nature
of the soil, to make it mellow, and fit to produce proper
crops; but when this is done, it will produce as weighty
crops as any land in the country, and may be very pro-
ductive by a proper rotation of crops for many years, with-
out receiving any manure.
   There are a considerable number of fields in sown grass
in the parish; the crops are generally oats, bear, (no bar-
ley), pease or beans, or pease and beans mixed together.
   The lands, unless when broken up out of ley, are dunged
for bear; afterwards two crops of oats are taken, some-
times a crop of pease, and then dunged for bear; formerly
there was a great quantity of small oats sown; this is mostly
