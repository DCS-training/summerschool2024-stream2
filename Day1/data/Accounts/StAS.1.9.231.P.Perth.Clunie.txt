     of Clunie.

Here, as on the other Highland lochs in its neighbourhood,
the bell time of taking the trout, is a dark windy day, in
June, July, or August, or, which is equally proper, any
calm warm night in that season; and for the night-fishing,
you must use an artificial fly, of a white or very bright
grey colour.  There is here no angling of any consequence,
owing principally to the want of a- boat.  About 30 years
ago, Mr Patrick Simpson, then minister of Clunie, who
was a very expert angler, as well as a very respectable
clergyman, caused make and carry up hither, at his own
expense, a small fishing-boat, which, however, soon after
his death, fell to pieces, having no shed to screen it from
the winter storms.  A mile to the westward of Loch-Ben-
achally, and still nearer the tops of the mountains, is Loch-
nachat, a small loch, full of fine trouts.
   About 4 miles S. E. of Loch-Ben-achally, and on a level,
perhaps 700 feet lower, lies the loch of Clunie, a beautiful
piece of water, somewhat of the form of a blunted equila-
teral triangle, about 2 1/2 miles in circumference.  Its sur-
face is probably not more than 80 feet above the conflu-
ence of the Tay and Ila, which last is only 93 feet above
the level of the sea.  Its greatest depth is about 84 feet,
and lies on the N. side towards the highest bank.  The
ground rises from the loch all around, with a bold slope,
and is in a tolerable state of cultivation.  The W. and
N. W. banks are pretty much decorated with verdure and
plantation; and had the opposite banks a little more of the
aid of ornament, which in all probability they will soon
have, this loch would be one of the first natural beauties of
the country.  About 200 yards from its western shore, there
is a small but pleasant island, near the centre of which
stands an old castle, in good repair, an occasional summer
residence of the Earl of Airly, who is superior of the loch,
proprietor of the barony of Clunie, and first heritor of the
