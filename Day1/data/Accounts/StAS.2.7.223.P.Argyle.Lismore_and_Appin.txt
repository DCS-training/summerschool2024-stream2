                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   The united parish of Lismore and Appin was formerly called
the parish of Kilmaluag, from Saint Malocus, the tutelar saint of
the parish, who is said by some to have lived in the seventh cen-
tury, but by others probably about 1160.  We are not informed
of the place either of his birth or of his death; but his bones are
said to have been translated to Lismore, and the spot where they
were landed is still pointed out, and is called Portmaluag, or Mo-
locus' landing place.  Near this landing place, there are to be
seen the remains of a building, which tradition says was a
church built on the spot where the saint's bones first touched Lis-
more ground.  Lismore was a Bishop's see, the seat of the Bishop
of the Isles, and, at a certain period, of Argyle; for when that
county was erected into a diocese, (being separated from that of
Dunkeld upon a petition presented to the Pope, by John the Eng-
lishman, Bishop of Dunkeld,)-the bishop of the new diocese fixed
his residence here, and the ruins of his castle are still to be seen,
The upper parts of Appin belonged, at some remote period, to the
parish of Eleanmunde, or island of Saint Munde, who was abbot and
confessor in Argyle, about the middle of the tenth century.  The
island of St Munde is situated in Lochleven, near the place where
the river Coe, which runs through the celebrated glen of that
name, discharges itself into the Loch.  It contains the ruins to
church, which, from the style of its architecture, does not appear to
have been of a very ancient date.  The parish of Eleanmunde com-
prehended Glenco and the adjacent parts of the braes of Appia,
on the south side of Lochleven, and the districts of Mamore and
