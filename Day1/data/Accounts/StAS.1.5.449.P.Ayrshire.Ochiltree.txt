village is in a flourishing condition.  The salary, however, is
only L. 8 Sterling. There is also a private school, or two.

   Poor.-There are a great number of poor in the parish
About 20 receive regular monthly supplies.  The only
funds are the weekly collections, which amount, on an a-
verage, to about 12 s. per week, besides the extraordinary
collections on sacramental occasions, which, for some years
past, have been about L. 9 Sterling per annum.  These col-
lections are chiefly, it not solely, contributed by the com-
monalty, there being but one small heritor residing in the
parish.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants, according to a
list taken this year (1792), amounts to 1150.  The return
to Dr Webster in 1755, was 1210 souls.  The average of
births for 5 years preceding 1792 is about 37.  The ave-
age of marriages and burials cannot be ascertained, on ac-
count of the inaccuracy of the parochial registers.  There
are about 220 families in the parish, and 67 of these in the
village.  There are about five to a family, taking coutry
and village together, but taking them separately, there are
six in the former and four in the latter; a circumstance
which strongly proves the superior healthiness of a country
life.  There are 30 more females than males.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are about 9 families
of Seceders, some of the Burgher, and some of the Anti-
burgher persuation.  All the rest attend the parish church,
and are regular in their attendance on ordinances.  The
inhabitants in general are remarkable for the simplicity, in-
tegrity, and purity of their manners.  Except a few shop-
keepers, masons, joiners, and weavers, chiefly in the vil-
lage, they are all farmers, who are not much in the world,
