   Miscellaneous Observations.-A number of the inhabitants are
tackmen of farms; and there are several cottages in the pa-
rish.  Some of these work in the mines of Landhills and Wan-
lockhead: others possess a piece of ground under the tacksmen,
and follow any kind of work that occurs, with a horse or hor-
ses, whereby they are enabled to pay their rent.-The people
are generally intelligent, sober, and regular; but of late, seem
to have more fondness for showiness of dress, and convivid
meetings, than could have been expected in so remote a situa-
tion.-Curling is a favorite diversion among the commonali-
ty; and even the gentlemen sometimes join in it.-George
Colebrooke, Esq is patron of the parish.-Part of the great
road from Glasgow to Carlisle passes through the parish, where
it meets another great road from Edimburgh to Leadhills.
There are, besides, several internal roads in the parish; to
which great attention is paid; and the statute-work is per-
formed upon them annually.
