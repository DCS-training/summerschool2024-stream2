Wemyss.  Wynnefield consists of 650 acres.  The farmer's
house is a little more than an English mile upon a public
road, very gradually sloping from Hilton-hill, and the fer-
tility and value of the land sensibly declines as it recedes
from Hilton; and this decrease in the goodness of the soil
is most perceptible on the north side of the road.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the po-
pulation in 1755 was 399.  At present, this parish contains
in all 590 souls; of which number, 206 are men; 246 wo-
men; and 139 children at or about 10 years of age.  One
of these men is 93, and one-woman 94; this old woman is
found and healthy, and as she came in with the century, so
there is good reason to believe she may see it out.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The present incumbent is Mr John
Waugh, in the 82d year of his age.  He was ordained
a dissenting minister in Alnwick in 1743, and admitted.
minister of Whitsom at Whitsunday 1755; he is a wi-
