The following memorandum will best exhibit what he has done.
It is supplied by one who has superintended personally the whole
of the operations mentioned.
	Mr Monteith commenced draining in 1836, on the plan recom-
mended by Mr Smith of Deanston, called " the Frequent Drain
System."  For the first two years stone drains were used, and
finished in the following manner:--Dimensions, 13 inches wide
at top; 6 inches wide at bottom; 2 1/1 feet deep; filled one foot,
with stones broken to pass through a 2 1/2 inch ring, on the top of
which was laid an inverted turf, and the loose earth filled in above
it with a plough or shovels. The cutting and filling cost 2s. 9d.
per rood, (the subsoil being all to pick;) the stones cost 3s. per
yard for quarrying, breaking, and cartage of two miles; and two
yards were required for one rood, or 36 yards of a drain. The
drains were 18 feet apart, so 26 3/4 roods are required per Scots
acre. The whole expense per Scots acre is as follows:

<TABLE>
Cutting and filling 26 3/4 roods at 2s. 9d.,                        L. 3 12 10 1/2
53 1/2 yards of stones at 3s.,                                         8  0  6
                                                                    L. 11 18 4 1/2
	The operation of subsoil ploughing, performed the following sea-
son, was done thus:--A common plough, with three horses yoked
abreast, takes a furrow, one foot broad, and ten inches deep, and
is followed by the subsoil plough of 400 weight, drawn by five
horses, three abreast, and two in front, taking a furrow in the bot-
tom of the last one seven inches deep. This operation turns the
soil, and breaks up (but does not turn) the subsoil to the depth of
17 inches. The subsoil ploughing is always performed at right
angles with the drains, and costs L.1, 16s. per Scots acre.
	The tile-work, already noticed, was erected in 1838; and drain-
ing with tiles is now preferred to stone drains, being much cheaper.
The drains for tiles are made 12 inches wide at top, 5 inches wide
at bottom, and 2 feet deep. The soles and tiles are then laid,
and covered with an inverted turf, and the loose earth is filled in
similar to the stone drains. The drains, for the most part, are put
in 18 feet apart, and cost as follows:

<TABLE>
Cutting and filling 26 3/4 roods at 1s. 10d.,         L. 2   9    0 1/2
2500 tiles at L.1, 10s. per thousand,                    3  15    0
Cartage two miles, 2s. 6d. per do.,                      0   3    9
