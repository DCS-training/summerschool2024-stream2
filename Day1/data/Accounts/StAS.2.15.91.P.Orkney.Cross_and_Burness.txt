   Burness parish, with the exception of three acres in Hettal, and
  18 acres, the minister's grebe lands, is the property of

  Thomas Traill of Westove, and is, including wind-mill and water-will, occupied by
   sixty tenants, paying rents varying from L. 4 to L. 40 each, making a land-rent,
   exclusive of kelp, of                                    L. 510 19 10

   acres, is occupied by the factor, and the other man-
   sion-house of Saville, with lands around, is occupied

   about                                                       130  0 0

           Net land rent of Burness in 1840,                 L. 571 0 3

  The gross rents stated above being L. 1564, 11ss. 11 3/4d. Ster-
 ling, (after making allowance for lands farmed by proprietors
 themselves, which it is probable Mr Clouston did not include in
 his rental, as also for the difference in the relative value of money
 and farm produce, the rents being then mostly paid in kind,) it
 will be seen that the gross rents of these two parishes have been
 more than doubled since 1793; and this, notwithstanding th`t not
 only kelp but rabbit skins, upon which he counts for part of the
 farmer's profit, have become unsaleable. But the most casual ob-
 server will see at a glance, that, from whatever cause the value of
 grain and cattle now yearly exported, is proportionally increased.
  When the manufacture of kelp was a source of profit to the,
 proprietors, and when almost everything else was neglected in
 order to increase its quantity, the produce of the manufacture
 from Cross and Burness was as follows:

             Note. -The tenants of Westbrough and Warsetter yet pay a
	    considerable rent for the kelp of their properties ; but this
	    kelp rent has been deducted before stating the land rent as
            above.
