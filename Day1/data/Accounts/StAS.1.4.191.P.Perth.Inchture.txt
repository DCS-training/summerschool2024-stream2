     NUMBER XXV.

     PARISH OF INCHTURE.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN MILLAR.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   THIS parish and that of Roffie were united in 1670,
and the church of Roffie is now a ruin.  Inchture, or
Inchtower, seems to have got its name from standing on a
rising ground.  It is allowed, that some time ago the river
Tay ran on the north side of the Carse of Gowrie, and
joined the river Earn at a place called Invergowrie, about
2 miles W. from Dundee.  Several towns, situated upon
the higher grounds between these rivers, are hence called
Inch this and Inch that, Inchmartine, Inchmichael, Megg-
inch, Inchture, etc.  This parish lies in the county of
Perth, in the presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus
and Mearns, extending from S. to N. about 4 miles, and
from E. to W. about 3.  It is bounded on the E. by the
parish of Longforgan; on the S. by the rivers Tay and
Earn, which now run in one channel; on the W. by the
parishes of Errol and Kinnaird; and on the N. by the pa-
rish of Abernyte, and a part of Longforgan parish.
