                       PARISH OF INCH.

	PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

	 THE REV. JAMES FERGUSSON, A. M. MINISTER.

           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE name of the parish is evidently Celtic. Inis,
Ynis or Inch signifiesisland. In the Loch of Castle-Kennedy, op-
posite the present church, is an island supposed to have been the
site of a religious house prior to the Reformation. This island
was called the INCH, the hence the name of the parish.
	Extent and Boundaries.--The parish is about ten miles long,
and in some places nearly the same in breadth. It is bounded on
the north by the parish of Ballantrae; on the east by the parishes
of New Luce and Glenluce; on the east by the parishes of
Stenykirk and Portpatrick; and on the west by the parishes of
Leswalt and Stranraer, and the Bay of Lochryan.
	Topographical Appearances. The north part of the parish con-
sits of high lands partly arable, bur chiefly covered with heath,
rugged and not susceptible of culture. The highest elevation is
812 feet above the level of the sea. The south part of the parish
is low; and, when viewed form the hills, has the appearance of a
plain; but it is gently undulating in its surface. This part of the
parish lies in an isthmus between the bays of Lochryan and Luce.
The soil is in general light, resting on a bed of sand or graven.
There are some curious hollows here, called by the country peo-
ple pots, perhaps formed by the retiring sea, which is supposed to
have overflowed on the farm of Aird, near the church, is of an oval
form, and is about 1000 feet in circumference, and about 100 in
depth.
	Coast.--There is an extent of shore of about eight miles along
Lochryan. The shore is flat, sandy or gravelly, except where it
joins the parish of Ballantrae; it there acquires a rocky and pre-
cipitous character.
