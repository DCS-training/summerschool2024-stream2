     Statistical Account

   The ancient family of Nether-pollok has been long the prin-
cipal family in this parish.  It has in its possession several origi-
nal papers of considerable antiquity, which deserve attention.
Among these, the chief which the writer of this account has had
an opportunity of observing, are the following: A precept from
the Lords of Council of King James V. to meet his Queen
when she came first to Scotland, dated 1527; a letter
from Q. Mary Regent, 1559; a letter from Morton and
others, anent the murder of the King, 1567; a letter from
Q. Mary, before the battle of Langside; a letter from King
James for an hackney to the Queen, 1590; another for pro-

the King and Council, 1587.  The letter from King James,
for provision to the Prince's baptism, is a great curiosity, and
deserves to be made public, as affording a singular picture of

with great distinctness and beauty, in a character resembling
Italic print; and can be read with as much facility, as the

deed dictated by wisdom, and a just zeal for our dearest in-
terests; but the peculiarities of a party which were after-
wards associated with it, and which by many, are considered
as having belonged to the original transaction, have brought
it into disrepute.
   There have been five ministers in this parish, besides the
present incumbent, since the Revolution.  It is singular that
two of these, namely, Mr Crawford, and Mr Wodrow,
have written histories of the Church of Scotland.  The his-
tory written by Mr Wodrow is universally known.  He was
born about the year 1680, and died in 1734.  Besides his
worth as a minister, he was a man of extraordinary industry
and application, to such researches as were connected with
