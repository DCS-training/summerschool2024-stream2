of a ready money market for their cloth, as soon as cut from 
the loom, without travelling 100 yards from their own
doors.  It is also a matter  of great conveniency to have a
Post-office at Leven, with an arrival every day from Edin-
burgh, Monday excepted, and a departure every day, ex-
cept Saturday.  The turnpike road, from Kirkcaldy to the
east coast of Fife, intersects the parish in a straight line from
west to east, at the distance of about half a mile from
the town of Leven, and the turnpike road from Kirkcaldy
to Cupar, by Cameron bridge, runs diagonally through the
northern part of the district.  In a short time, there will be
an excellent road from  the shoe of Leven to Cupar, the
county town, which is distant about 10 statute miles.  The
principal advantage of the parish, is, the having abundance
of coal in the near neighbourhood, the ordinary fuel of the
poorest families.  Peats are a sort of rarity, of which some
families purchase a small quantity yearly, for their conve-
niency.  To all these advantages, it may be added, that eve-
ry person in health, may, with moderate industry, earn a
comfortable livelihood.

   Disadvantages-As Leven is a throughfare from the
west to the east of Fife, the inhabitants are much op-
pressed with beggars and vagrants.  Largely as they contri-
bute to the support of the indigent among themselves, they
complain, that they give three or four times more to stran-
ger poor.  It is an obvious defect in the police of this coun-
try, that no effectual method is deviced for restraining va-
grant beggars, who lay the public under such heavy contri-
butions.  It may, perhaps, be said, that the people are not
obliged to serve them:  But such as are acquainted with the
state of the country, know well, that while these vagrants are
permitted to go about, the people must give them something.
