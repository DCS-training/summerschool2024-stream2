	Factories.--The cotton mill of Rothesay contains 23, 448 spindles;
and employs 355 hands. Spinners earn from 17s. to L. 1, 4s. a
week, and women from 9d. to Is. 3d. a day. The workers in this
mill are generally very healthy. They work according to the regula-
tions of teh Factory bill. About 150 of the youngest attend a
well taught school in the evening, and their morals are not infe-
rior to those of the rest of the population; a circumstance which
is not a little owing to the excellent discipline kept up by the
manager.
	A power-loom factory employs 85 hands. The men's wages
vary from L. 1, Is. to L. 10s. a week, and women's from 3s. 6d.
to 8s. It was erected about fifteen years ago, is well managed, and
the workers are of respectable morals.
	There are several cooperages which employ 34 hands, who
make yearly 15,000 hetting-barrels of the value of L. 3000.
There are also two small yards fro building boats, which employ
about 20 carpenters, and a tan-yard of considerable extent.

burthen, belonging to Rothesay; total register tonnage 2950 tons.
These were navigated by 255 men, abd were employed in the figh-
