erected Inchaffrey, into a temporal lordship, in his favour.

   Clan M'Grigor-In Glenorchay, the chieftain, of the clan
M'Grigor, a numerous and potent tribe, had long his princi-
pal residence, and a freehold property.  On an eminence, op-
posite to the parish church, still called the Gallow Hill, were
executed all criminals, doomed to death in his courts of justice.
The process was often summary, and the execution speedy.
The fun, in its course of one day, beheld the culprit at large,
apprehended, arraigned, adjudged, condemned, and brought

The surname was, for ever suppressed; and, at baptism, no
clergyman was to give the name of Grigor, under the penalty
of banishment and deprivation.  Happily those manners and
times are no more!  In our days, the innocent are not indis-
criminately involved in the infamy and punishment of the
guilty.  An act so severe is repealed by a more enlightened
legislature; and the clan M'GRIGOR, in possession of their
