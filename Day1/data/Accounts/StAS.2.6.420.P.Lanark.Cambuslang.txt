for about two and a-half miles, falls into the Clyde near Clyde's
Mill. Cocks-burn rises near East Rogerton in Kilbride, runs in
an easterly direction upwards of three and a-half miles, and falls
into the Calder near Greenhall in Blantyre. These are all small
streams, running on gravelly or rocky beds, in deep gullets or great
ravines; occasionally pouring down heavy torrents, in the winter sea-
son, into the channels of the Clyde or Calder, while in the summer
season many of them are nearly dry. The village of Kirkhill,
Cambuslang, is not well supplied with water. In the summer sea-
son, in particular, the inhabitants are obliged to go a considerable
distance to the Burn-well, a small,open spring at the bottom of
the "Preaching or Conversion Brae." There are two small lochs
or lakes to the east of Dechmont, which appear to be artificial.
	Geology and Mineralogy.--This parish forms part of the great
coal basin of the Clyde. The coal is wrought chiefly to the west and
north-west towards Rutherglen, Springhall, and Coats.  The field
in which it is found lies on the south side of the Clyde, and may
be about 3 miles square. It has a general slope from the Cathkin
hills towards the river, with considerable swellings here and there,
and in several places is cut and broken by rivulets. At this field,
at Stonelaw in Ruthergien, and generally throughout the district,
there have been found at intervals, within 415 feet of the surface,
seven seams of coal, five of which are workable. The thickness
of the seams, and their distance from the surface are nearly as
follows:

	Before reaching the first coal, there is in most places a surface
of earth and clay, from a few feet to 20 or 30 feet thick; beneath
which, there are 20 feet of an argillaceous white freestone, succeed-
ed by 30 or 40 feet of shale, with vegetable impressions, inter-
mixed with thin strata of freestone separated from each other by
a little clay or mica. There are about 6 inches of Dogger or coarse
                                4
