     Statistical Account of the

wise kept here, the dies and some copies of a gold medal,
with a suitable device, appointed by the will of the late John
Gray, Efq. of London, to be bestowed on such of his mathe-
matical bursars as should discover an uncommon genius for
these sciences, upon certification by the professor, that they
have produced some invention or improvement therein, de-
serving of this mark of distinction.  The premium has hither-
to been only once conferred, viz. in 1795, in favour of Mr
James Skene, now in a medical department in the East In-
dies.  The medal is of the weight of two ounces of gold.
To these may be added the common seal of the University,
bearing the arms of the family of Marischal, and of the city
of Aberdeen, united: the crest, rather expressive of the va-
nity of the inventors, is a meridian sun, with the motto,
"Luceo."
   The apparatus for teaching natural philosophy, in mecha-
nics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, optics, electricity, etc. is es-
teemed very complete, and perhaps equal to any in the unit-
ed kingdom.  Among other articles, it contains a large col-
lection of models of the most useful machines in various arts
and manufactures, of the heft workmanship, and with the
latest improvements.  For this collection the College is in-
debted to a liberal grant, continued for several years, from
the Board of Trustees for promoting Fisheries and Manufac-
tures in Scotland.  All the models, together with the greater
part of the apparatus, have been executed by an artist of this
city, under the direction of the present professor.  By means
of this extensive apparatus, he is enabled, besides his regular
course of scientific lectures, to give occasionally a popular
course of experimental philosophy, the chief object of which
is the practical application of this science to the arts, and the
common purposes of life.
