     Statistical Account

   Farms and Rents.-Land lets from 12 s. to 36 s. per acre.
The farms are of various sizes: They are not too large, nor
are they of that diminutive size, which, though it may give
the appearance of population to a country, must prevent the
markets from being supplied to that degree with grain, that
is requisite for the success of manufactures, and will always
produce a dispirited and unskilful tenantry.  The valued rent
is 6519 L. 8 s. 4 d. Scotch.  The real rent may be somewhat
above 3000 L. Sterling.

   Minerals and Mineral Waters.-Free stone is found in ma-
ny places, and there are two quarries of it for sale.  Coal
abounds in this district.  It has hitherto been dug only in
two places, in the higher grounds; the one on the south and
the other on the north side of the Tyne.  From these pits
coal is obtained for a great part of the south and east districts
of this county, and a good deal is carried to Lauderdale.  A
pit has also been sunk lately near the Tyne, and an engine is
erecting for clearing away the water, as the seam of the coal
lies much deeper than the bed of the water.  Lime-stone
may probably be found in many places; kilns, however, are
erected only upon the estate of Pencaitland; and some idea
may be formed of their extent, from the circumstance of 45
cart-loads of coal, weighing each 15 cwt. being frequently
used in the space of a week for burning the stone.-There
are several springs of water of the mineral kind.  They have
never met with much attention from the public; but are
held in high estimation by the common people, for scorbutic
disorders.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air is more salubrious than
might be expected in a situation so low, with the Tyne, a
muddy slow running water, passing through the middle of it,
