   Landed Property and Farming.-The property of this
parish is chiefly vested in Dundas of Arniston and Hepburn
of Clerkington, the valued rent of the two remaining heri-

Much of the land is well adapted to the culture of turnips
and potatoes, and for raising crops of hay, and these modes
of cultivation will probably become more extensive and
perfect, when the roads through the parish shall be made

market.  The other crops raised are barley and bear, oats
and pease.  The barley is raised in the lower part of the
parish and sold to brewers and distillers at the fiars of the
county.  The bear is raised in the higher parts and sold to
the same persons at the 2d or 3d fiars.  The oats sown
here are the common oats of the country, known by the
name of Blanslie oats, and red oats, that answer well in our
