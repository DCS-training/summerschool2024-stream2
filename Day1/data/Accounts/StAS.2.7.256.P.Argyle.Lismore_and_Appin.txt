better advantage in manuring and improving his land."  The peats
are now become scarce in Lismore, and consequently the people
are under the necessity of going to a great distance for them over
seas to Kingerloch, and Benderloch, in the parish of Ardchattan,
so that, from the time, and trouble, and expense which are requir-
ed to make and bring home the peats, first by boats over the seas,
and then by-carts overland, it would be cheaper for the people to
burn coals.  In Appin and Kingerloch the Peats are made at
much less expense, as they are found near at hand, and, from the
fibrous and adhesive quality of the moss, are capable of being
easily cut by an iron instrument made for the purpose.

                    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   It appears to me that Lismore is well calculated for a manufac-
turing district, and I have little doubt that an establishment of the
kind would be very beneficial to the parish, as it would open a
source of employment and gain to the superabundance of the po-
pulation.  There is a never-failing supply of water to drive any
machinery; abundance of excellent and peaceable work people
would be got in the parish; and the land, if attended to, would
produce ample provision for a large establishment, which would
bring money into the country; and as steam communication
is so easy, the raw material might be brought from Glasgow
in four-and-twenty hours, and the manufactured goods might
be landed there in equally short time.  Liverpool, too, is within two
days' voyage of Lismore, so that, in every point of view, I think
that capital in the hands of enterprising parties might be turned
to good account, at the same time that the country would be be-
nefited by, the establishment of some manufactory in Lismore.
