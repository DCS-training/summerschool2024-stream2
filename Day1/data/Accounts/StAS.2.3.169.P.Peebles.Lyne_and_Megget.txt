                           III.-POPULATION.
   The population of Lyne and Megget appears to have been much
greater in former times than at present, In the year 1755, it
amounted to 265, and probably it was then considerably less than
it had previously been.

                In 1792, it was 152   71 males. 81 females.
                   1801,        167   67       100
                   1811,        196   95       101
                   1821,        176   87        89
                   1831,        156   83        73

   The decrease of the population appears to have been chiefly
occasioned by the junction of farms, by the absence of several clas-
ses of tradesmen who formerly were in the parish, and by the in-
creasing number in Megget of non-resident tenants. The parish
record shows that for a series of years two marriages, and three,
often four, births, have annually occurred. The population is en-
tirely rural. About the end of 1833 there were in the parish 159
persons, males 83, females 76. Of these there were,

   Character of the People.-The inhabitants of the parish certainly
enjoy in a reasonable degree the advantages and comforts of social
life, and no symptom of discontentment with their condition is per-
ceptible. They are reflecting and intelligent. They have a taste
for knowledge and for reading; and, what is of much greater im-
portance at a time when scepticism and a disposition to remove
needful restraints are very prevalent, they show a becoming regard
to religion and morality.
