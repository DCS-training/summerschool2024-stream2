                 I. TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

     Name.-- THE parish of Kirknewton comprehends what were
formerly the two separate parishes of Kirknewton and East Cal-
der.
     The old church of Kirknewton stood close by the village or
town of this parish, and hence obviously the name, (Kirk-new-town.)
     East Calder was anciently called also Calder Clrere, or Clair.
The former name has manifest reference to its situation relatively
to Mid and West Calder.  The latter designation arose from the
manorial district being the property of Randulp de Clere, to
whom, it was granted by Malcolm IV., and it was so called to dis-
tinguish it from Mid-Calder, then called Calder Comitis, which
had belonged to the Earls of Fife from so early a period as the
twelfth century. The word Calder means the woody water, or a
territory as characterized, being compounded of the Celtic terms,
Cal or Coil, signifying wood or woody, and Dur or Dour, water
or stream.
     Estent and Boundaries.--This parish lies to the west of Edin-
burgh, one of the great roads from the city to Glasgow traversing
it for nearly 4 miles, viz. from Burnwynd, 8 miles from Edinburgh,
