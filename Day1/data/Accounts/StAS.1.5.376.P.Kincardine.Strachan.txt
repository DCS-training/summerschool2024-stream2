     Statistical Account

   Hills.-The altitude of the highest hills, from the level
of the sea, according to a survey made some years ago, is 
as follows: Kerloack 630 yards, Montbattack 1150, 
Kloachnabane 790.  On the top of this last mentioned hill, 
there is a large rock, commonly called the stone of Kloach-
nabane, accessible only on one side.  It is a land mark for 
ships at sea, and commands a most extensive prospect of the 
adjacent country, and a long tract of the sea cost. 

   Heritors and Rent.-The proprietors are Alexander
Burnett, Esq; of Strachan, Francis Russell, Esq; of Black-
hall, and John Douglas, Esq; of Tilliwhilly, proprietor of 
the lands of Gellan, at Blackhall there is an excellent 
modern house lately built, and there are large plantations 
of sir and birch along the banks of the Dee, for 2 or 3 
miles. The valued rent of the parish is L. 2033: 14: 3
Scotch. 

   Church, School and Poor.-A new manse was built about
15 years ago, for the accomodation of the minister, and a 
new church last year, which is very well finished in every 
respect.  Mr Burnett is patron.  The stipend, including the 
value of a small glebe, and L. 20 Scotch of grass money, 
may amount to nearly L. 70 Sterling.-The funds for the 
support of the poor amount to L. 8 Sterling, arising from 
interest of money, and from L. 9 to L. 10 of collections on 
the Sundays, and when the sacrament is dispensed.  It goes 
a great way to relieve the most necessitous poor.-There is 
a parochial schoolmaster, with a legal salary; but some parts 
of the parish reap little benefit from the school, being at a 
great distance, and waters intervening; which particularly 
is the cafe, as to the glen of Dye, the upper part of which 
is about 6 miles distant.  The encouragement given to 
schoolmasters is by no means adequate to thier usefulness;
