   2d query.  Lough Allen is everywhere deep and navigable,
about 9 miles long, and the Shannon is intended to be made
navigable thereto; though the works at Jamestown, about 7
miles distant, seem to be this season suspended.  There are
two other rivers, the Feorus and the Argnach; neither of
which are navigable, but both apt to sweil suddenly with
mountain floods, by which they enrich their banks, but the
latter remarkably so.  *They, as well as the lake and the
Shannon, are immensely stored with pike, eel, trout, perch,
etc. which may be taken in every season of the year, except
the winter months; but never, so far as I can find, employed
as a fund of industry by the neighbouring inhabitants, nor
sent to any market for sale.  The river Argmach, I think,
merits a particular description, being in many respects a na-
tural curiosity.
   It rises in the glyn which divides Draliave from Sheve
Corkrah, and taking a straight line from its source, to its en-
trance into the Shannon at Balytra Bridge, is about 7 miles
long; but if taken by its meandrings, would measure double
the length; however, in all its serpentine course, it does not
deviate more than half a mile from a straight line drawn
from its source to its end.  No river in this kingdom swells
so suddenly after a fail of rain, the torrent being irresistible,
and carrying along an immense quantity of fine earth, sand,
mountain sludge, etc.  In the first 4 miles of its course,
through the glen which divides the two mountains, it has
many rapid falls through the rocks, and runs in a line rather
straighter than when it entirely quits the mountains at Arg-
mach Bridge; after it passes this bridge, it meanders through
a valley for near 3 miles, rendered, by its overflowings, al-
