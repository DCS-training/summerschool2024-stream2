are all great and invincible obstacles to improvements in hus-
bandry.

   Springs and Minerals.-There are no rivers of any note.
A rivulet takes its rise in this parish; which passing down-
ward, through the parishes of Lesly, Premnay, etc. takes the
name of Gadie, and afterwards becomes a branch of the
river Urie, which falls into the Don at Inverury.-There are
many springs of water, impregnated with minerals, as sulphur,
etc.; but none frequented for medicinal purposes.-Almost
every, possession has plenty of out-lying stones for building
inclosures.  Quaries may be found, in many places, of ex-
cellent granite, very sit for building, and easy to be wrought.
In one place, near the site of the mansion-house of Knocker-
pock, (in the front of Craig-Hill), there are veins of va-
riegated marble, which promise some sort of quarry of that
kind.  A considerable time ago, about the year 1754, it was
dug a little, and some of the largest pieces, that could be got,
were collected, and sent up to Judge GORDON of St. Christo-
phers, then proprietor of the estate, who at that time resided
at Moor-Place, near London:  But, whatever opinion was
formed about them, no further notice has been taken of the
place since.

   Population.-The population of this parish has decreased
considerably within there 40 years; chiefly owing to some fa-
milies, who had small farms, removing to the manufacturing
towns, where they find a more easy and comfortable way of
living.
