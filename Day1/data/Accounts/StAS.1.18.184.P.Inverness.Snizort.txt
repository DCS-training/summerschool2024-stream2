souls in all.  Population in 1755 was 1627.  The increase
therefore, is 181.  The session funds of this parish are so
poor, (being only the Sundays collections, which are exceed-
ingly small, and a few trifling articles besides), that they do
not admit of having a session clerk, consequently no register
is kept of either births, marriages, or deaths; so that no cer-
tain conclusion can be formed upon these articles.  The funds
of the parish are distributed yearly, or once in the two years, a-
mong its poor, who depend for their mantainance chiefly on
the generosity of the benevolent tenant.
   The number of black cattle, horses, and sheep in the parish,
is not easily ascertained; from the best information and strict-
est enquiry, it is concluded there are no fewer than 2537
cows, including all at and above a year old.  A certain num-
ber of these, the different farmers and tenants drive to Portree,
where two public fairs are held in the year, the first always
on the last Wednesday of May, and the second on the same
day of July following; and there dispose of them to the best
advantage.  From the money got for their cattle (which is
the chief, and I may say the only export of the place), they
pay their rents to the different landlords, and furnish the requi-
sites for themselves and families.  There are no fewer than
597 horses, all of which are reared and bred for private use.
It is believed the number of sheep are nearly about 1952,
chiefly of the small highland breed; the wool of these sheep,
some of which is of a pretty fine texture, the different fa-
milies get manufactured into cloaths, stuffs, and blanketing of
various sorts for their private use.  A few goats are kept
by the principal farmers.
   Red foxes, notwithstanding, a handsome premium is given
for every one that is killed, are still numerous and very des-
tructive to sheep and lambs.
