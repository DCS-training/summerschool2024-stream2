   Horses.-The breed of horses are much better now than
formerly, though great room still remains for improvement.
Not long ago four-horse ploughs were common over the
parish, each of which animals, though scarce able to support
their own weight, would eat as much as the horses that now
plough in pairs.
   The whole horses at present in the parish are about 662,
whereof about 577 are farm-horses.  These last will con-
sume annually 4936 bolls and 1 1/2 lippies of corn, allowing
a lippy and a half to a horse each day; which, at 3 d. per
lippy, comes to L. 3948: 16: 10 1/2 Sterling.  So that when
4 horses were yoked in each plough, in place of 2, the num-
ber would be double, and the expence L. 7897: 13: 9 Ster-
ling.  Were oxen used in place of horses, the whole of the
above corn would be saved, which would maintain 705
men, allowing 7 bolls to each; and, taking the inhabitants
of all ages, it would support double the number, being
1410 persons, which is one half of the present inhabitants
of the parish, which, at first view, many surprise, but the cal-
culation will hold good.
   If we reckon the inhabitants of the parish of Kilmadock,
executive of the people of the Adelphi, to be near 2800,
and the horses 570, there is about one horse for every fifth,
foul, which is serious concern to the nation.  In the pa-
rish of Kilmadock there are several farms with 4 horses
each, which, at L. 10 each horse of maintenance, makes
L. 40 each farm; and the average rent of each farm will
not exceed L. 30.  So if the heritor would recommend
oxen in place of horses, he might put the L. 40 in his poc-
ket, and save the expence of purchasing and upholding the
horses to his tenant, as oxen would live on grass and turnip,
and after 5 years labour would bring more money then their
prime-cost.
