of L. 8: 6: 8, With an allowance of L. 2, 10 s. as session-
clerk and precentor.  By this and his other perquitites and
emoluments, he makes about L. 20 a-year.  His fees for
teaching English and writing, are 1 s. 6 d. the quarter;
for arithmetick, 1 s. 8 d. and for Latin, 2 s. 6 d.  His ave-
rage number of scholars is 30.  The school in Strelitz,
which was originally established by the Commissioners on
the Annexed Estates, is continued by the Society for pro-
pagating Christian Knowledge, with a salary of L. 5 a-year,
besides a free house and some other perquisites; which he
is allowed by Mr Drummond of Perth, the proprietor of
the village.  His fees are much the same as those in the
parish-school, with this difference, that he must teach poor
scholars gratis.  His school is regularly visited, and exami-
ned by a committee of Presbytery.  At last visitation, there
were 39 scholars.  The school at Woodhead was erected in
the year 1787, by the tenants in the west end of the pa-
rish, for the benefit of their children, on account of their
great distance from the parish-school.  The schoolmaster
has a free house, but no fixed salary.  His emoluments,
therefore, depending on the number of his scholars, and di-
ligence and success in teaching, prove happy excitements
to exertion.  The number of scholars who are instructed 
at this school, on an average, is 45; all of whom learn to
read, write and cypher.

   Poor.-Much praise is due to the gentlemen of this coun-
ty, for the salutary regulations they formerly laid down
for suppressing vagrants, and providing a sufficient main-
tenance for the necessitous poor; but it is to be regretted
that laws, framed with to much judgement, should have
been enforced with so little attention and strictness.  Agree-
