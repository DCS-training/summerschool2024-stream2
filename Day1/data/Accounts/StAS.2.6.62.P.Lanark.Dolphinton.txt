were then let at L. 50 yearly, from which there were paid L. 13,
8s. 8d. Scots yearly to the minister who served in the church,
and L. 3 6s. 8d. Scots, to the Archbishop of Glasgow, for pro-
curations and synodials. At the second reformation, viz. from
prelacy, Alexander Sommerville, minister of this parish, acted a
prominent part. At the earliest stage of the struggle, he with
Henderson and others, resisted the orders of their archbishops to
use the liturgy. When charged to obey on pain of imprisonment
and ejection as a rebel, he supplicated the privy-council, and got
the diligence suspended. He was appointed moderator of the La-
nark presbytery in the place of the constant moderator for the
bishops. He was also nominated one of the commissioners to at-
tend the tables at Edinburgh. In 1638, he represented the pres-
bytery at the memorable Glasgow assembly, and opened the busi-
ness by preaching before an immense congregation, all armed with
"whingers." The presbytery of Biggar was, through his influence,
erected in 1644. He died about the year 1649, and was succeed-
ed, on Ist April 1650, by James Donaldson, who was ejected from
his living in 1663 for nonconformity to prelacy, Immediately after
the suspension of Donaldson, William Dogood officiated as an
Episcopalian clergyman. He was succeeded by Alexander Dou-
glas on the 28th September 1675. He went to Douglas, and was
succeeded an the 24th April 1679 by Andrew Hamilton. He was
succeeded by James Crookshanks, who was instituted 17th May
1684, and deposed for profane swearing. Donaldson was reinstated
in 1688. John Sandilands was ordained January 1693; John San-
dilands, his son, October 1711; John Bowie, May 1717; Thomas
MacCurty, November 1770; James Ferguson, August 1773; John
Gordon, March 1781; Robert Russell, March 1815; John Aiton
April 1825.
	There were formerly four dissenting churches within reach. Of
these two are totally deserted, and the other two had been long
without any stated pastors till of late. The average number of
communicants is about 130, and of attenders on public worship
100. During the last seven years there have been five charitable
collections, amounting in all to about L. 30.
	Education.--The school and dwelling-house are very comfort-
able and commodious. The salary is L. 26, and the wages yield
about L. 15. William Brown, about 1658, mortified four acres of
land, now worth L. 8, for behoof of the schoolmaster, and 1000
merks, the interest of which is paid him for educating poor scholars.
