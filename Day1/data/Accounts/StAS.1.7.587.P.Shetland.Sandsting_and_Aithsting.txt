     of Aithsting and Sansting.

September.-No estimation can be made of the quantity or
value of each species of crop, as every man has his own
water-mill or hand-quearn, and grinds his own crop; but, in
good seasons, the crop in this parish would always maintain
the inhabitants, with the help of milk and fish, and potatoes
and cabbage.  The two latter grow in great abundance.

   Wages.-Men-servants get from 15 L. to 8 L. Scotch, for
three-fourths of the year.  In summer, they are all employed
in the ling fishing, and the boys on beaches.  The men get
from 12 L. to 24 L. Scotch; boys from 6 L. to 10 L. Women-
servants get from 12 L. to 8 L. sometimes cheaper, when they
get their "hands to themselves;" that is, liberty to spin and
knit stockings, for their own behoof and emolument, at lei-
sure hours.  The yarn is generally spun at night, when they
would be otherwise idle; and, when carrying dung, or tra-
velling on the road, they are always knitting.  Their service
to the master is often very inconsiderable; and they would
not get meat for their work in any other place.  Artificers
are seldom paid by the day, and are always maintained by
the employer.  A mason has from 10 d. to 14 d. a day; his
servants 6 d.; wright, 10 d.; taylor, shoemaker, and boat-
builders paid by the piece, and generally earn 8 d. or 10 d.

   Provisions.-A fat ox, weighing from 3 to 4 cwt. sells at
3 L. Sterling; a cow, 2 L.; sheep, 3 s.; lamb, from 10 d. to
15 d.; calf, 1 s. 2 d.; swine, 2 s. or 3 s.; pigs, 6 d.; goose,
8 d.; hens, 4 d.; chicken, 2 d.; butter, from 5 s. to 8 s. or
9 s. per lispund; potatoes, 6 d.; cabbage, never sold; ditto
plants, from 3 d. to 12 d. per hundred.  When meal is sold
in the parish, it is from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. for oats, and 1 s. 8 d.
or 2 s. for bear-meal, per lispund; seed oats, 1 s. 3 d.; bear,
1 s. 8 d.
