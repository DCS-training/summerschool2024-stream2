     of Thurso.

   The weavers are principally employed in the manufac-
ture of linen cloths, but they also work coarse woollens and
plaiding, of coarse wool, carried from the ports of Leith and
Inverness.  None of the finer wool, produced from the
Cheviot breed of sheep, kept on the farms of Langwall and
Armadale, is manufactured in the country.  In the year
1796, the quantity of wool brought coastwise to the port of
Thurso, was 151 cwt. 19 qrs. 5 lb.
   There is another species of manufacture, which, though
it employs a great many hands, is not of much real benefit
to the country; and that is the spinning of flax for the south
country manufacturers.  It appears by the Customhouse
Books, that for the three years preceding the 1st of January
1797, the average amount of dressed flax which was brought
coastwise to the port of Thurso, was 84,583 pounds weight
per annum.  This quantity of flax would produce 53,114
spyndles of yarn.  The spinners are paid at the rate of 1 s.
per spyndle, and the agents or factors employed to give out
the flax, and take in the yarn, have 2 d. per spyndle for
their trouble.  So the spinners, for their labour, receive
L. 2655 per annum; and the factors, for their trouble,
L. 443; being, in all, L. 3098 per annum.  But how infe-
rior this to the profit which would accrue to the country,
if the above quantity of flax were made into fewing threads,
or manufactured into cloth in the country; and how small
a consideration for the loss which the farmers sustain by the
want of the labour of the women, employed in spinning,
which might be more beneficially applied to the purposes
of agriculture.  It is true, that some proportion of the above-
mentioned quantity of flax is made into cloth in the country,
but it is, comparatively speaking, a small share, scarcely de-
serving of any notice.
