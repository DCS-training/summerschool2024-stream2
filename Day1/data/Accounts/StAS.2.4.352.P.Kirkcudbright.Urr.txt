	A very amusing account has been given respecting Robert de
Bruce's gift of the mote referred to, to a woman named Sprotte.
The story, called " King Bruce's Bowl," is related by Simon
Sprotte. It was inserted in the Dumfries and Galloway Courier,
1st October 1822.
	On the estate of Redcastle, and about a mile east from the
Mote of Urr, there is a rude block of granite of considerable
height, standing upright in a plain field, but tradition is silent as
to the purpose of this erection.
	Auchengibbert was the residence of the Buchanites, before
they removed to Crocketford. The sect is now reduced to two
individuals.

	The villages of Dalbeattie and Springholm contain a popula-
tion (a great proportion of which is Irish,) which the state of the
surrounding country is unable to support by lawful industry.
Hence poverty with its generally accompanying evils greatly pre-
vails in these two villages.
				IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--Agriculture, in this part of Scotland particularly,
laboured long under great disadvantages, and, even after it began
to improve, made very little progress for some time. About 150
years ago, some lands in this neighbourhood, which would now
bring a rent upwards of L.200 Sterling per annum, were offered to
any tenant who would pay the public burdens. From the year
1688 to the year 1740, agriculture seems to have improved very
little. In the year 1760, shell-marl was discovered in Gal-
loway; and the abundant crops at first produced by the use
of this calcareous manure caused a general tillage of large tracts
of land, which had been set apart for the purpose of grazing black-
cattle. A spirit of industry began then to be diffused among
the tenantry and labourets; but it was afterwards discovered,
that marl manure was used too copiously, which brought the
land into a state of consequent sterility. Honest industry was
also greatly cramped by the vicinity of the Isle of Man, with
which the inhabitants of Galloway carried on an extensive
smuggling trade. But that island having become subject, about
