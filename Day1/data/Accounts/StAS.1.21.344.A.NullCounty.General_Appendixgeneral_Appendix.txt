ocean, it may be supposed, would form a complete barrier;
hut when navigation was discovered, what before was consid-
ered a disadvantage, would then appear the greatest benefit.
As the discovery of a general principle usually unfolds a va-
riety of subordinate causes and effects, so the value of rivers,
lakes, and bodies of water, in lossining the expence of land
carriage, suggested the idea of navigable canals in those inland
districts where the navigable rivers did not extend; and the
same principle would evince the advantages and disadvan-
tages of each gradation, and shew the method of improving
on the discoveries first made.
   Navigable canals have many peculiar advantages.  They are
not subject to storms and tempests like the ocean, nor to the
ebbings and flowings of the waters, which the mariner must
await in creeks and arms of the sea, nor to the swelling and
subsiding of rivers; and they can be constructed deep or
shallow, wide or narrow, long or short, to answer any pur-
pose.  Their only enemy is frost; but this impediment is on-
ly for a short part of the season; and navigators have now
discovered a method of cutting the ice, and letting the vessel
pass.  The general advantage of navigable canals being then
so manifest, let us apply the case to Scotland, and in particular
to the district under consideration.
   Scotland is an agreeable as well as healthful country.  Tho
in general the soil is barren, yet there are many fruitful val-
leys, and even the more rugged parts, in an agricultural view,
are capable of great improvements, and may be converted to
many useful purposes.  But Scotland's greatest advantages are
of a commercial nature; and, in this view, her agricultural
disadvantages become of the very last importance.  Her bar-
ren mountains produce a multitude of water streams for turn-
ing all kinds of machinery; her barren mountains furnish
wood, stone, and other materials for buildings of every de-
