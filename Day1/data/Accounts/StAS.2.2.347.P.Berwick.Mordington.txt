ascribed almost entirely to the withering influence of the English
poor-law system.
   Inns, &c-There are no fewer than four public-houses where
spirits are sold. Two of these are at toll-bars; but it is to be
hoped that this number will soon be diminished.
   Fuel.-Coal is easily obtained by the inhabitants of this parish
from the Berwick collieries: it is sold at the rate of from 3s. 4d.
to 4s. 8d. per cart load.
