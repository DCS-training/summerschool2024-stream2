<TABLE>The following, however, is the amount, such as our re-
gisters afford, for the last three years, of
Marriages, Births, & Deaths.
In 1788, there were           2        27       14
In 1789,                      7        16       11
In 1790,                      4        21       17
---      ---      ---
13        64       42

The average therefore appears to be 4        21       14

   Though there are no remarkable instances of longevity,
many persons have died, aged from 70 to 90.  One or two
are now alive aged 92 years.  The number of Seceders
amount to 130.  There are neither Episcopals nor Roman
Catholics in the parish.  The diminution of the number of in-
habitants, from 1771 to 1778, was owing to two or three
small farms, in different places in the parish, having been let
to one tenant.  The increase of population from 1778 to 1790,
was visibly owing to seuing ground by plan for a village
at West Gordon, where, though purchasers have built good
houses for themselves, and some for tradesmen, and day-la-
bourers, the farms being better cultivated, yet the tenants
have been obliged to build houses to accommodate their ser-
vants and labourers.  Many of the tenants and their servants
have 6 or 7, and some 8 and 10 children by one wife.  A
farmer died this year, who had 15 children by one wife, 9
of whom survived him.  A mealmaker died lately, who had
been twice married, and was the father of 18 legitimate
children, 9 of whom survived him.  A labouring man died
a few years ago, aged 80, who had been the father of 20 le-
gitimate children, of these only 3 survived him.  He had
been thrice married.
