many losses and inconveniencies arising from the want of
bridges over these rapid and dangerous rivers.  This circum-
stances has often produced very serious and distressing effects,
particularly in the case of the post, surgeons called to the
sick, the minister of the parish, and the parishioners in getting
to and from the church, and in travelling about their affairs,
marriages, christenings, burials, markets, mills, smithies, etc.
The commissioners of supply, and surveyors of roads were
so sensible of these dangers and inconveniencies, that they
have bad recourse to an expedient for removing them, which,
though inadequate, was all they had in their power, namely,

The parish furnishes about 30 small wherries, from 6 to 10

the boat; but the average may be about 6 L. to such as give
only a partial attendance on the fishing (being in harvest
obliged to secure their crop, fuel, etc.), and from 10 L. to
15 L. to those who prosecute the fishing during the whole sea-
son, which is generally from the beginning of June to christ-
mas.  The herring fishery has not totally failed any one year
for these last 20 or 30 years, though some seasons have great-
