                     PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS.

                     THE REV. ALEXANDER FLYTER, MINISTER.


                     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
             Name.-ALNESS appears to be the only name which has, at any
          period, been given to this parish. It is compounded of two Gaelic
          words, auld, signifying a burn or small river, and neas, a point.
             Extent, Boundaries. &c.-The extreme length of this parish
          from north to south, though from the mountainous and unculti-
          vated character of a great part of it, it has not been exactly ascer-
          tained, may be stated at 20 miles. The breadth from east to
          west varies very considerably at different points, and may be con-
          sidered as giving an average of 5 miles throughout the entire
          length. The parish of Alness is bounded on the north,by imagi-
          nary lines dividing it from that of Kincardine; and on the south,
          by the shores of the Cromarty Frith. On the east, it is divided
          from the parish of Rosskeen by the river of Alness; and on the
          west, from that of Kiltearn by the river Auldgrande.
             Topographical Appearances.-Tbe general appearance of the
          parish is pleasing, as it is well wooded, and presents to the eye an
          agreeable variety of moor and cultivated land. The lands lying
