and by their liming, draining, &c. are evincing a laudable anxiety
still more to ameliorate the character of the soil.  They are much at-
tached to their landlords, who treat them in return with kindness and
liberality.  The largest farm in this parish is the Barony of Cess-
ford, which consists of upwards of 2000 acres of land, and which
has long been occupied by Mr Archibald M'Dougall, a gentleman
whose ancestors resided for generations on the Roxburghe estate in
this quarter, and who is well known to be one of the most skilful
and intelligent agriculturists in the district.  Within these thirty
years, the improvements which he has effected on that property have
been very great.  In the course of that time, he has enclosed, at
his own cost, the whole farm, drained it in the most efficient man-
ner, and brought under cultivation upwards of 300 acres of moor-
land.  Besides, he has removed all the old offices and cottages, and
erected in a more eligible situation new ones of the neatest and
most substantial kind.  Independently of the expenses of liming
the whole of this large farm, his outlay amounted to upwards of
L. 4000.
The system of husbandry which is usually practised in this pa-
rish is the five-shift system.  The turnips are partly eaten off the
land by sheep, and partly stored up as provisions for fattening cat-
tle during the winter.  Of leases the usual duration is for nineteen
years.  The fences are in good order, and consist mostly of thorns.
The farm-houses and offices are also in excellent order, and have
been some of them erected within these twenty years.

rish are of the Leicester breed, and every attention is paid to their
improvement.  The cattle which are fed here are almost all of the
short-horned kind, and these are sometimes fattened to an immense
size.
