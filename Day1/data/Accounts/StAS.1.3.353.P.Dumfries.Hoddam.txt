dale, almost the whole of the roads were impassable during
the winter season.  The power granted by the act 1777, has
enabled the gentlemen of the county, who have exerted
themselves with much laudable zeal, to repair, in the course
of 14 years, almost every road of consequence in the respec-
tive parishes.  The four great roads within the county,
which lead to Edinburgh by Langholm, to Edinburgh and
Glasgow by Sanquhar, as also the road from Annan to Lang-
holm, are now turnpike roads, and have all been effectually
repaired since the year 1777.  The tolls upon them produce
about 1700l. per annum; and no county, either in Scotland
or in England, can boast of having better roads than
the county of Dumfries.  From this cause alone, Dumfries-
shire has become a great, rapid, and substancial.  Lime, the
only manure used for the improvement of waste lands, can
now, by means of the good roads, be without any difficulty
transported to a considerable distance at all seasons.  The
great, almost the only drawback, which this parish sustains, is
the want of coals.  Our distance from these is about 16
miles, which renders their carriage by land very expensive;
and the unreasonable oppressive tax laud upon coals imported,
renders their carriage by sea still more burdensome.

   In the account of the parish of Hoddam, the village of
Ecclesechan must not be omitted.  It consists of 105 houses
and 500 inhabitants.  In this village there are two well fur-
nished inns, where passengers meet with good accommoda-
tion, and may be provided with post chaises and post horses.
There are 2 inns of an inferior kind, 22 tippling houses, and
8 shops.  It has been a post town since the year 1788.  The
mail coach, which runs between London and Glasgow, passes
and repasses every 24 hours; and every day is a post day in
