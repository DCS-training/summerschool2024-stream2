   Heritors, Church, etc.-There are 9 heritors.  Two of them,
till lately, resided in the parish, but have not for some time
past.-The church is in excellent repair.  The manse and
offices in the same state.  The glebe and garden are valu-
able.

   School-The school house is large, containing a proper a-
partment for the scholars, besides accomodation for the
school-master's family.-The school-master's salary is too
merks, which, with the other perquisites, exclusive of his in-
come from the school, and a good garden, may be valued at
L.10 per annum.  The average number of his scholars may be
reckoned at, from 37 to 40.  Should this be thought dispro-
portionate to the population of the parish, it may be remark-
ed, that a great many of the young people are so situated, that
it is much more convenient for them, to attend other parochi-
al schools.

partly owing to the grass ground being better laid down, but prin-
cipally, to the turnip husbandry, has certainly very much increas-
ed.  About 14 years ago, both black cattle and sheep were, from
10 to 15 per cent. cheaper, than at present.  But this is to be un-
derstood of lean cattle; for the sat then sold generally dearer, espe-
cially in the spring season.  This difference might be owing to the
small quantity of turnip then raised, and to the distillery's not being
carried on to their present extent.  But if the distilleries continue to
flourish, and if such quantities of turnips continue to be raised,
there will always be a great demand for half fed cattle; so that
butcher meat has now little chance of being much dearer in the
spring, than at any other season.  Formerly there were a great
many bad fed cattle killed at the end of autumn, which sold very
cheap, and prevented good and well-fed cattle from fetching their
value.  About 20 years ago, butcher-meat was generally from 50
to 70 percent. dearer at Whitsunday than at Martinmas.
