Carse.  The reverse is now undoubtedly the fact here; for
some years past in the spring, a rush fever has visited the low
ground, on each side of the hills, viz. The Carse and Strath.
more, and carried off numbers; very few, however, of the
inhabitants of this parish were infected, and none died.  Of
epidemic disease, it may be remarked, that agues, which
some years ago appeared in great numbers, both in high
and low grounds, have now entirely vanished.  This has
been attributed to the draining of wet lands, and more nou-
rishing diet of the people.  I have been assured, that 30
years ago, if a farmer in the spring wanted 4 of his cot-
tagers for any piece of work, he generally ordered 6,
knowing the probability that some of them, before the
work could be finished, would be rendered unfit for labour,
by an attack of the ague.  Rheumatisms, called emphati-
cally the pains, prevail in this district, as in most places of
Scotland The most general disease, however, in this di-
strict, and particularly in this parish, is scrosula; not a fa-
mily of most of the indigenous inhabitants of the lower ranks
is free from it.  Some laboures in this parish are at pre-
sent deprived by it of the power of earning their subsist-
ence.  This evil seems rather to be on the increase, from the
carelessness of the people themselves, and the intermar-
riages or the unfound with the healthy.

   Population.-According to the return made to Dr Web-
ster, the number of souls was then 258.  The population,
though now nearly the same as at the beginning of the cen-
tury, has decreased considerably within these 20 years.
The number of inhabitants, on 1st January 1792, was 345;
of examinable persons, i.e. above 8 years of age, 276.
