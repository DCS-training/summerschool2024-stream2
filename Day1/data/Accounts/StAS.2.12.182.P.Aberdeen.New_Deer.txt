                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Village.-There is but one village in the parish, New
Deer, containing upwards of 100 houses, 90 on the property of
Mr Gordon of Manar, and the remainder on Lord Aberdeen's
property.  It lies on the ridge of a hill, and the fields decline to
the east and to the west of the street.  It is situated nearly at an
equal distance from Banff on the north-west; Fraserburgh on the
north-east; Peterhead on the east; and the Newburgh an the south.
It is distant from Aberdeen nearly north thirty miles.
   Means of Communication.-There is a daily post from Aber-
deen, through Methlic, and the communication is carried on
to Strichen, Peterhead, and New Pitsligo, and Banff.  There
are nearly 100 miles of roads in the parish; a good road
great part of the way from New Deer to Ellon, distant thirteen
miles. The turnpike-road from Peterhead to Banff crosses the
parish; and a mail-coach regularly travels from Peterhead to
Banff, and returns the same day.  There is a stage-coach thrice
a-week from Aberdeen to New and Old Deer and Strichen,
through Ellon.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is a very old and ruin-
ous building.  There is a date on it of 1622.  It is about seven
miles from the north and south extremities of the parish.  It is in
a very bad state of repair; but the heritors are about to erect a new
one.  The church being found too small, an aisle was added in 1773.
It is seated for 900 persons, and the seats belong to the tenants,
who pay 1s. 6d. a sitting at the commencement of their lease,
which, when they quit their farms, they get back from the incom-
ing tenant. *
   The manse was built in 1832, and is a commodious house.  The
glebe consists of 5 acres, value about L.10, and a grass glebe of
5 3/4 acres, value about L.5.  The stipend is 16 chalders, half
meal half barley, at the price, with L.10 for communion
elements.

<FOOTNOTE> Since this was written, a handsome church has been built, capable of containing
1500 persons, and the old church has been entirely demolished.
