	The kinds of trees generally planted or indigenous in the parish
are oak,* ash, larch, Scotch fir, birch, alder, &c. The Earl of
Mansfield keeps a forester, under whose judicious management he
receives from his woods by periodical felling, by thinning, and by
preparing bark, an income of from L. 500 to L. 600 a,year.
	Husbandry, &c.--With regard to the state of husbandry, the
common breeds of sheep and cattle, rate of labour, and the price
of different articles of raw produce, this parish differs little from
the parishes in the vicinity, and, to avoid inconvenient repetition,
the reader is referred to the Accounts of these parishes for infor-
mation on such subjects. The farm-buildings and enclosures are
far from being in a satisfactory state, which circumstance certain-
ly operates in various w`ys as an obstacle to improvement. The
duration of the leases, however, which is usually fifteen years, is
thought to be equitable at once to the landlord and to the tenant,
	The following is an account of the land in lease, the rental, the
farm produce, and the live stock of the parish, as contained in the
private census already-mentioned, taken by the writer in 1823-24.

<FOOTNOTE>It may not be improper to record here, that some boys transplanted a young oak
on the day of the first anniversary of the battle of Waterloo to a spot a few paces in
front of the manse door, under the roots of which a bottle was afterwards deposited,
containing an inscription, which some antiquary of a future age may delight to find
and to decipher. This tree bears the name of the Waterloo Oak.
	  This is independent of the minister's glebe, which consists of thirty-six acres,
nearly five of which are occupied with a garden, pleasure-ground, and plantation
round the manse, the rest being all arable, and subjected to a rotation of five years.
