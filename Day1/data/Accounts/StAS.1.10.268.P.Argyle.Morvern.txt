   Fishing.-At the head of Loch-alin, there is a salmon fish-
ing, of service to the people concerned, but the exports are
not considerable.  On the north side of the parish, or near
the head of Loch-Suineart, herrings are found sometimes in
great abundance, of good size and quality, in the months of
August and November, which would be of considerable ad-
vantage to this and the neighbouring parishes, were there a
certain and easy method of supplying the inhabitants with
salt; but this is not the case; a circumstance very discourag-
ing to the fisher, and detrimental to the community at large.
This was particularly felt in the year 1790, as no salt could
be found in any of the neighbouring customhouses of Tober-
mory, Oban, or Fort-William, at the time needed; the con-
sequence was the loss of many of the herrings.-The other
kinds of fish, found on these coasts, are seathe, red or rock-
cod, skate, lythe, flounder, mackarel, sea perch, dog-fish,
gurnet, eel, and, at the mouth of almost every river, small sal-
mon, and white trout; besides a variety of shell-fish, such as,
oysters, cockles, lobsters, crabs, muscles, limpets and peri-
winkles, spout fish, etc.  There are also found marine vege-
tables; dulse, and flake, which are much esteemed by those
who are in the habit of using them.  These articles, though
of service to the inhabitants, are never found in such quan-
tities as to be sent to market*.
