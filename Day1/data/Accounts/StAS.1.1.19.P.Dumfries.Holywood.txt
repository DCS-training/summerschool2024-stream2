ing situated in the middle of a broad valley, it is in general 
flat and low land.  The hills in the parish are neither high
nor rocky.

   Rivers.-The river Nith runs along the whole of the east end
of the parish, intersecting it, however, in one place for above
a mile in length.  The river Cluden, also a considerable one,
runs along the south side of the parish above eight miles, and
intersects it in three places, emptying itself into the Nith in
the south-east corner of the parish, near the old College or
Provostry of Lincluden, which stands on the Galloway side
of the river in the parish of Terregles.

   Fish.-The Cluden abounds in fine burn trouts; a few pike
of a middle size, and of excellent quality, some salmon, some
sea trout, and herlings*.  The Nith produces the same kinds
of fish, but with this difference, that the herlings, sea trout,
and salmon, are much more plentiful in it than in the Clu-
den.  One peculiarity deserves particular notice:  Thought the
two rivers join at the south-east corner of the parish, each
has its own distinct species of salmon.  The Cluden salmon
are considerably thicker and shorter in their body, and great-
ly shorter in their head, than those of the Nith.  The burn
trouts abound in the spring and summer; the herlings and
sea trout in July and August; and the salmon from the be-
ginning of March to the beginning of October.  The salmon
is in the greatest perfection in June and July.  In the spring
it fells for about one shilling a pound  of 16 ounces, and gra-

*Herlings are a small kind of trout, a little larger than a
herring, and shaped like a salmon; its fresh is reddish, like that
of the salmon or sea trout, but considerably pales.  They abound
in all the rivers in this part of the country, and have the name
of herling in all the adjoining parishes.
