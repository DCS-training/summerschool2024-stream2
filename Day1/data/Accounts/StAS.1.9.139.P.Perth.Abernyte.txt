coarse gravel, or rather rotten moor-stone.  The grounds
higher up, of a deep, loose, poor soil, and partly of mortar,
or coarse till, on a bed of wet gravel.  Toward the tops of
the hills the soil is thin and rocky, producing little but
coarse grass, mixed with heath.  The number of acres in
the parish cannot be accurately ascertained, but is estima-
ted at 1600.

   Heritors and Rent.-The parish is divided among 4 heri-
tors, 1 of whom possesses more than half of it; none of
them reside.  The valued rent is L. 1126:  13:4 Scots,
and the real rent about L. 830 Sterling.  The farms are

village and church stand, is let at L. 2 Sterling the acre, be-

from the end of March to the middle of April; potatoes
and flax in the end of April; barley from the 1st to the
end of May; turnips in the beginning of July; wheat from
the end of September to the middle of November.  Wheat is
generally reaped about the end of August; the harvest of the
other crops succeeds soon after.  In the higher and moorish
part of the parish, it is often the end of November before
all is got in.  No epidemic disease have been remarkable
for their ravages in this parish, except those common every
where among children.  The people have very lately be-

years ago, some people entertained an idea, that the hill
