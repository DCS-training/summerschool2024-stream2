wedge put in across, where the land is stiff and coarse.  The
manures are of the usual sort.  No marl has hitherto been dis-
covered; but we use plenty of lime.

   Mills, etc.-We have 2 lint mills, 4 meal mills, 1 for bruis-
ing lint and rapeseed, 1 fulling mill for woollen cloth, and 1
threshing mill for grain; and 3 kilns, with yetling, or cast iron
floors, for drying grain.

   Improvements.-One material regulation, which tended
greatly to the improvement of this country, was dividing the
large farms into as many lots or divisions as there were te-
nants, and setting down every man on his own lot, instead of
having two or three ploughgates, all run-rig, as formerly.
By this practice, the stoven was left behind, while the industri-
ous farmer beautified his lot, and enriched himself.  A great
extent of new ground has been cultivated, and rendered arable.
Mr. Buchanan of Cambusmore has at present rich grass or
corns on several hundreds of acres, where heath, knee deep-
used to grow.

   Wild Plants.-The most obnoxious weeds are thistles, (ser-
ratula), wild mustard, dock, spurry (spergula arvensis), bi-
shop-weed, cow-parsnip, fitches (vicca sepium), cow-thistle,
mugwort, coltsfoot, or tussilago, triticum repens, avena sterilis,
daitytis glomerata.  The principal officinal herb is the uva
ursi, which grows in great abundance on the face of the hill
above Stronedragon, in Brea-Leney.  Several others are to
be found, which are common almost every where in Scotland.
-This parish affords a good field for the botanist.  A great
variety of splactinums, niniums, bryums, hypnums, lichens,
junger mannias, tremillas, agarici, voleti, and other fungi, are
to be found.  No plant, except what belongs to the class
