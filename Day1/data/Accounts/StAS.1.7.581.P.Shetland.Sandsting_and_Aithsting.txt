lispunds.]  The merk is equal to 1 1/4 Amsterdam pound, 24
merks equal to a lispund, or 30 merks Amsterdam.  The
butter rent has never been raised above this rule in any part
of this parish; but the price has been raised from 5 s. to 10 s.
per lispund; and the money rent has, in some places, been
quadrupled.  There are also many ontjeth, i. e. small parcels
of ground lately inclosed from the common, and set to a te-
nant for money rent only.

   Appearance and Climate.-The appearance of the parish is
rather hilly, but none of the hills are of any remarkable
height when compared with those in the neighbouring pa-
rishes.  The cultivated ground is generally at the foot of the
hills, and on the sea-shore, and there is not a house in the pa-
rish half a mile distant from the sea.  On the west side of
the parish the hills are generally green on a mossy soil, and
affording little pasture for sheep or horses in winter.  On the
north the hills are dry and rocky, with small long heather,
and fine sweet grass.  In the middle of the parish the hills
are deep moss, and afford plenty of coarse grass called Lub-
ba, and short bushy heather.  The parish is every where in-
tersected by long narrow bays called here Voes, or Friths.
The pasture on the side of the Voe and in the Ness, or pe-
ninsula formed by two Voes, is generally good, and great
plenty of sea-weed or tang to be found on the shores.  There
can be no river in the parish-some small burns or rivulets,
which afford excellent trout, and the sea-trout come into the
burns to spawn, and are often caught in nets in August and
September.  There are upwards of 40 fresh water lakes in
the parish; many of them might be drained at a small ex-
pence, and would greatly improve the pasture, or might be
inclosed for meadows, as the bottom is mostly green or mud-
dy.  There are two inhabited islands, containing one family
