out of moor, and is consequently of a moorish nature.
On such a soil, it is found to have the most powerful
effect, and to make it produce the above mentioned
crops, viz. grass, pease, and bear or barley, in abun-
dance, which it would not do before, even with the best
dressing and dunging.  This effect it must produce, not only
from its acting as a stimulus, but from its power also
of deepening the soil, and especially of retaining the
moisture; a circumstance of the first importance in thin
light, dry ground.  Our farmers here are sensible of the
great benefit of lime to their grounds; but some cannot
afford, and others grudge the expense; and thus not a
great deal is yet used.  It is to be had from the distance
of about 6 or 7 miles, in the parishes of Boharm and
Keith, in the county of Banff, of the best quality; and
when carried by the owners, as it generally is, it costs
about 9 d. the boll; that is, 3 Winchester bushels pretty
nearly: when brought only to the other side of the
Spey, it costs generally 7 d. or 7 1/2 d.  The trouble and
expense of ferrying it over the spey is a great and al-
most unsurmountable bar to the general use of it here.
Among the many advantages that would result from a
bridge over Spey, the removing of this difficulty would
be one of the most important, not only to this parish,
but to all the eastern part of Murray.
   Turnips and potatoes answer extremely well in our
light soil, even without lime.  But as our grounds are
almost all unenclosed, and cattle and sheep, for the most
part, go at large during the winter, there is a great dis-
couragement in raising turnips, and little are therefore
yet raised.  There is nearly the same inconvenience
with respect to sown grass: the sheep either pluck it
up by the root, or eat it so bare, as to prevent its com-
