of about 15 acres, viz. 10 acres arable, 3 of bog meadow,
and 2 of woodland and pasture, worth about 15 L. per annum.
The schoolmaster's Salary is 100 merks Scotch.  The school
fees are only 1 s. per quarter for English and writing, 1 s. 6 d.
for arithmetic, and 2 s. per quarter for Latin.  Both salary
and fees are by far too small to encourage a person of classical
education to continue the toilsome office for any length of
time:  Hence we are often changing masters.  It is a great
pity but that some suitable provision were made for so useful
an order of men.  In winter, there is a private school kept
in another quarter of the parish, to which there is between
30 s, and 40 s. per annum left by the late schoolmaster, a na-
tive of the parish, and between 4 L. and 5 L. to the poor,
which fail to them at the death of two men, to whom these
small sums are left in liferent.  Several children find it more
convenient to attend the above school, and one in the parish
of Ruthwell; to that the public schoolmaster's income will
not exceed 13 L. per annum, There is a very good school-
house lately built, but no boule for the schoolmaster.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the roll, who receive quar-
terly supplies, has not exceeded 6 in any one year since
1772; besides whom, some few others receive occasional aid.
There are no poor's funds in this parish besides what arise
from the weekly collections.  An addition of 5 L.  Sterling,
however, was left at Whitfunday 1791, by a man who died
in the parish of Dumfries, and left several children of his
own, whose progenitors were natives of Mouswald.  There
are none belonging to this parish who beg, yet it is daily
infected with beggars from Ireland and the neighbourhood
of Dumfries.  Numbers from Ireland go up to England dri-
ving cattle, and return home begging.
