  The form of the Tay being so extremely unfavourable to the
production of river tides for navigable purposes, it was some years
ago suggested by Dr Anderson to the magistrates of Perth, the
conservators of the navigation of the river, that they ought to adopt
all the means in their power, in co-operation with landed proprie-
tors along its banks, to contract as much as possible the breadth of
the stream below the town, by encouraging the construction of
embankments in suitable situations, and the junction of islands with
either bank, wherever the river flowed in two channels,-compen-
sating, at the same time, for the diminished area of the section of
the stream by a corresponding excavation of its bed. Several is-
lands have accordingly been joined of late to the nearest bank,
and the result justifies the expectation that the prosecution of si-
milar operations, on a more enlarged scale, will ultimately prove
highly beneficial to the navigation of the river; while it will be
the means of recovering, at a trifling expense, extensive tracts of
rich and valuable land. In fact, were a barrier of loose materials
to be thrown across the Tay, from the lands of Pitfour to the west
end of Mugdrum island; and were a similar erection to be execut-
ed from the eastern extremity of that island to Invergowrie bay, land
would be gained, along the north bank of the river, to the extent
of upwards of 4000 acres; and the river, by the operation, would
be rendered navigable as far as the harbour of Perth, for vessels
of 300 tons burden. The embankment would require for its
completion, 960,000 cubic yards of earth, which would cost about
L.20,000; and the facing of stone next the river, which would be
about 150,000 square yards, would amount to an equal sum; so
that the land would be obtained for about L.10 per acre,-while
the rise of the tides at Perth would be increased by the operation,
probably from three to four feet/f* in perpendicular height.
  Meteorology.-In describing the meteorological, phenomena of
the parish, we shall first give a synoptic, or tabular view of the
varying physical conditions of the atmosphere, by which the cli-
mate of a country is chiefly affected; and conclude with such ge-
neral observations on the subject, as the facts stated may seem to
suggest. The circumstances which mainly contribute to the pe-
culiar character of a climate, we shall describe under the usual

<FOOTNOTE>The junction of two islands with the western bank of the river, one a little
above, and the other a little below the Castle of Elcho, has the effect of
raising the tides from six to nine inches, and accelarating the time of high water, at
Perth, by half an hour.
