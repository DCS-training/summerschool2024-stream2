parochial poor (24* at an average of the last twelve years)
are assisted from the interest of L. 160, the rents of one of
the church-galleries, the weekly collections, fines for mis-
demeanors, etc.; the whole forming a yearly fund of L. 25
or L. 26 Sterling.

   Antiquity, an Eminent Character.-About a furlong
north from the house of Rothiemay is a Druidical temple,
which, though situated in the middle of a beautiful and fer-
tile field, a veneration for antiquity has hitherto preserved
entire.  Mr James Fergusson, well known, among men of
science, for his publications on astronomy, was a native of
this parish+.

   Character.-The inhabitants are, in person, slender ra-
ther than robust; in mind, acute and sensible.  They ex-
cel their forefathers less in the luxuries of the table than
elegance of dress; are generally very healthy; and live

*In 1783 and 1784, the number of poor was 45.  In 1783, the kirk-
session expanded L. 70 of the poor's fund in purchasing foreign grain.

+To certify this, it may be proper to subjorn, that my information of
Mr Fergusson's being a native of this parish I received from his brother,
John Fergusson, who was an elder of this parish, and died very lately.  He
told me, that his father's name was John Fergusson, his mother's Elipet
Lobban; that they dwelt at the Core of Mayen; that both he and his bro-
ther James were born there; that he himself was born in 1708; and that
his mother James was two years younger.  Accordingly the session-record,
which is now before me, confirms this information in every particular.
James Fergusson was born April 25, 1710.
   I do not recollect every particular related in the Memoirs of Mr Fergus-
son, prefixed to his works, not having seen them for several years; but
John, his brother, who had read these Memoirs, said, that, though generally
agreeable to fact, they were not equally correct in every particular.
