Fife, on the Frith of Forth, about 10 miles north of Edin-
burgh.  It is the seat of one of the sour presbyteries which
compose the provincial synod of Fife*; and, alternately
with Cupar, the ordinary seat of the synod.

   Extent.-The parish of Kirkaldy, so called from the town,
is a kind of irregular oblong, extending from S. E. to N. W.
between 2 and 3 miles, and from N. E, to S. W. about one
mile.  It is bounded on the S. E. by the Frith, on the N. E.
by the parish of Dysart, on the N. W. by the parishes of Dy-
sart and Achterderran, and on the S. W. by the parish of
Abbotshall.
   This last parish, with the exception of 3 farms which be-
longed to Kinghorn+, was originally a part of the parsonage
of Kirkaldy.  In 1649, the presbytery on an application from
the heritors, found that a new kirk should be erected in the
parish of Kirkaldy, for the accommodation of the parishion-
ers; and recommended to the Commissioners of the Parliament
for surrenders and tythes, to carry the erection into effect.
The next year, the new parish of Kirkaldy, since called Abbot-
shall was erected; and the parish of Kirkaldy proper, has from
that time been confined nearly to the burgh, the burgh acres,
and the common land and moor; comprehending, in all, an
extent of about 870 Scotch acres.

   Aspect of the town.-The town of Kirkaldy is situated at the
foot of a bank, on the sea-shore, along which it stretches the
whole breadth of the parish.  It is properly but one long
street, with a few lanes of small extent opening on each side
of it.  The principal part of the street appears to have been
originally wider than it is now, many of the houses on both
