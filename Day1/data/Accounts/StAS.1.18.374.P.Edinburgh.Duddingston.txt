when by their decay and resolution, they subside to the bot-
tom of the lake, and contribute to form a rich and black mud,
which has been found upon trial, to constitute an excellent ma-
nure.  The Trefoil (Menianthes trifoliata), is generally gather-
ed carefully in the month of June, for medicinal purposes, by
the emissaries of the laboratories.  The Reeds, which grow
at the west end of the lake in great luxuriance and plenty, and
cover above five acres of ground, have been employed by
weavers to supply their looms; and form, besides, a most
valuable thatch for any species of houses, which by the
strength and hardness of the fibres, resists the attacks of spar-
rows, mice, and the common vermin which infest and deface
straw roofs; and for the same reasons, will last incomparably
longer than any common thatch; while a smaller quantity
will suffice for the same work, and form a light, firm, and
durable roof.
   Of the animals, fish, and birds of this district, nothing sin-
gular or uncommon is to be remarked.  Foxes from the neigh-
bouring hill or plantations sometimes invade the farm-yards.
A solitary badger at times may provoke a stubborn chace and
contest.  Otters used to frequent Dudingston loch, and co-
lonies of rabbits, the sandy knolls near the sea-coast.  Seals,
porpoises, crabs, etc. are often seen upon the shore.  Curlews,
gulls, cormorants, and the common sea-fowl that frequent
the Forth, visit the coast; and sometimes make incursions to
the inland country.  The cormorant especially, not unfre-
quently extends his depredations to the fish of Dudingston
loch.  This lake is in summer covered with flocks of coots,
which when young, form a tolerable variety for the table.
They remain till the closing of the ice totally excludes them
from the water, when they emigrate to the sea, and return
with the first thaw.  Wild duck, teal, and water hens, also
frequent the lake.  Swans, originally imported tame breed
