Owing in a great measure to the mildness of the climate,
and partly perhaps to other causes, this place is believed not
to be productive of, or to foster, any epidemical distemper
amongst the inhabitants, who are generally strong and
healthy. - The soil is mostly light and sharp, containing
great numbers of water-worn stones, many of which are in
some places, so large, as to obstruct the operations of the
plough.  The moorlands, and higher parts of the parish,
contain in their foils a small proportion of mossy earth. A
rich black loam constitutes the foil of some of the grounds

Sterling per annum.  some places are parcelled out into
small paffles, or farms, few of which are above 30 acres
each.  the occupiers of most of them are under the neces-
sity of following some other occupation than that of farm-
ing.  a considerable number are weavers; each of whom 
has a loom or two in the corner of the house, which is ge-
nerally low and ill constructed.  they employ themselves
at the waving business, chiefly during winter.  Their uten-
sils are far from being always in the best order, or made 
after the most approved model.  They are, however, good
enough, for the fabric of the cloth woven, which is mostly
