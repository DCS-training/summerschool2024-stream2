baptisms had been partly destroyed or mutilated; and such as were
in existence continued in a loose and confused state, till the late ses-
sion-clerk collected them as far as possible, and transcribed them
into one volume.  The earliest date of the register of baptisms is
14th June 1700.  There are two or three interruptions, one of
these extending to twenty-six years, and ending 1740, from which
date it has been regularly kept.  It does not, however, exhibit a
correct account even of the baptisms (births it ought to have been)
in the parish, as scarcely any of the Dissenters register; and a con-
gregation of the Secession was formed soon after its origin, so early
as 1739.
  The illegitimate births in the parish in the years 1836-7-8
amount to 7.
  Of the register of proclamations the first date is July 18th 1740.
In it two blanks occur-one of four years.-From 1769 it is
complete.  The kirk-session minutes commence in 1742.  There
is a chasm from 1760 till 1769; since which date, no blank
occurs.
