of plantations of trees in Scotland, not only for supplying
the farmers, mechanicks, and others, with materials in their
respective callings; but for warming and improving the cli-
mate, we must allow great merit to Mr. Morison for his
own exertions, but still more on account of encouragement
given, and example shown to his tenants.  For, I apprehend, 
he stands among the foremost country gentlemen of the N.,
who have either given such generous terms, or have been at

plantations into one continued extent, which would nearly
reach from one extremity of the parish to the other, forming
an irresistible barrier against those points of the compass that
bring us the worst weather.
   Nor is Mr. Morison of Bognie, the only gentleman, in this

expected, his scheme has rather become exemplary, at least,
I am sure, that all the tenants on the estates of Bognie, who
