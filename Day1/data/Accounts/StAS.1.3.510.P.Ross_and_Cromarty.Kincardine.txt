   Manufacturers.-There are no manufacturers of any conse-
quence carried on in this parish.  The act 1746, discharging
the Highland dress, had the worst of consequences.  Prior to
that period, the Highland women were remarked for their skill
and success in spinning and dying wool, and clothing them-
selves and their households, each according to her fancy, in
tartans, fine, beautiful, and durable.  Deprived of the pleasure
of seeing their husbands, sons, and favourites, in that elegant
drapery, emulation died, and they became contented with ma-
nufacturing their wool in the coarsest and clumsiest manner;
perhaps thinking, that since they must appear like the neigh-

girls to be idle, they made them take to the spinning of li-

those spinners, is laid out upon slimsy articles of dress;
whilst that conscious pride, which formerly aspired at distinc-
tion from merit and industry, is converted into the most ri-
diculous and pernicious vanity, setting them above the drud-
gery of being useful domestic servants.

   Advantages.-No corner of Scotland, however, is better
adapted, for a manufacturing village, than Kincardine.  It is
in the near neighbourhood of two great corn counties, has
the advantage of water carriage, and a choice of safe har-
bours, for vessels of 50 tons burden.  There is plenty of
running water, and of the best Highland fuel.  It lies open
to several very populous districts, and, were manufacturers
once established, and shops opened, it would be resorted to by
many.  There are in the parish, and its immediate neigh-
