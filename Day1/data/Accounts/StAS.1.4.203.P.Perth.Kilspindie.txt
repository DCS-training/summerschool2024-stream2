small proportion only of the parish lies in the Carse.  It
mostly extends across the hills to that part of Strathmore,
which goes by the name of Stormount.  The hills are ge-
nerally barren; in many places the surface is covered with
a short heath, wet, and full of those whiteish or gray whin-
stones, which indicate a poor, unkindly bleak soil.  The
bottom is a very bad sort of clay, commonly called by the
farmers here Mortar or Till.  But though in general the
summits of the hills are barren and heathy, there are many
pleasant little spots in hollows and glens, where the soil is
good and fruitful in a high degree.  All those parts of the
hills which slope towards the Carse, are well cultivated,
and to the very summit; producing crops of every kind
that is to be found in the low country, nearly of equal
quality; flax, potatoes and turnip, in much greater perfec-
tion.  That part of the parish which lies in the hollow of
the Carse, is generally very wet, but of a deep rich soil, a
mixture of clay and moss, producing in good seasons, and
when well managed, very luxuriant crops.  The air is to-
lerably dry and healthy in general.  In some of the lowest
parts, it is rather moist and damp, but among the hills very
cold and penetrating.  In the hollow grounds, all through
this Carse, the ague was formerly a very prevalent distem-
per, but is now hardly known, owing, no doubt, in some
measure, to the draining of the grounds.  Rheumatism is
the most common complaint.

   Population, etc.-I have reason to believe the numbers
were formerly much greater than now.  The return to
Dr Webster was 828.  No farther back than 30 years, it
is known to many of the inhabitants, that in one district
there were between 20 and 30 families more than are now
upon it.  Instead of being divided into small spots, pen-
dicles, or farms of a few acres, it is at present in the hands
