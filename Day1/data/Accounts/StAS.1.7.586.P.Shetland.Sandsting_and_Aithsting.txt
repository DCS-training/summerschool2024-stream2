black oats.  After the seed is sown, the dung is laid about
it, and both are very slightly harrowed.  By this means, a
tolerable crop is generally procured, but the soil is never me-
liorated.  Prejudice and obstinacy prevent their adopting
other methods, which have, on experience, been found to
answer better, such as allowing the lands to lie two or three
years ley, then take two crops, always turning down the
dung, by which means dry outfield may soon be meliorated,
and converted into infield.  Some outfields or outbreaks can-
not admit of this, being 5 or 6 feet deep, and only give a
crop while the surface is rotting.
   Infield is generally laboured to bear or potatoes.  The bear
land is always dunged, and the dung ploughed, or turned
down.  Sometimes a crop of infield oats is taken, but very
seldom in this parish.  There are some infield grounds which
are well known to have produced bear for these 40 years,
without ever lying ley, or being sown with oats.  These
lands get a great deal of dung every year; and, in rainy
seasons, the crop is always laid to the ground.  The manure
for infield is cow-dung, kept in the byre until seed-time, and
frequently mixed with ashes and light mossy earth, which is
gathered in summer, and kept in storehouses for that pur-
pose.  The dung is carried out in winter on the outfields,
and made up in small dunghills, mixed with earth and sea-
ware.  As the farms are generally too small for keeping
ploughs, by far the greatest part of the parish is digged with
a curious light spade, made for that purpose.  The dung is
carried on people's backs, though sometimes horses are em-
ployed to carry it in creels.  There are only two carts in the
parish.  One of them has put out as much in a day as nine
people would have carried on their backs.  No man in this
parish will sow oats before the 17th April, by which means
the best season is often lost.  Harvest generally begins in
