carry the design into execution.  Mr Mackell's report at-
tracted the attention of the Board of Trustees appointed for
the Encouragement of the Fisheries and Manufactures of
Scotland; and at their request, Mr Smeaton in like man-
ner took the business under his consideration, and gave in
an estimate of the expence.
   After various attempts, a bill was sanctioned by Parlia-
ment, which gave powers for raising a stock of 1500 shares
for the purpose of making a canal between the Forth and
Clyde.  Each share was to consist of L. 100, and the whole
capital would thus amount to L. 150,000.
   On the 10th of July 1768 this great work was begun
under the direction of Mr Smeaton.  The operations com-
menced at the east end, and the late Sir Laurence Dundas
of Kerse, Baronet, cut and removed the first spadeful of
earth which was taken from the canal.  The spade is yet
kept in Kerse horse in memory of that transaction, which
was the beginning of an undertaking, great in the design,
and difficult in the execution; but happy in its effects, and
likely to be of unspeakable advantage to succeeding gene-
rations.
   On the 10th of July 1775, the canal was fit for naviga-
tion as far west as Stockingfield, which is within a few
miles of Glasgow.  About two years afterwards a side
branch was cut, by which vessels could go still nearer Glas-
gow, and a bason, together with granaries, and other build-
ings, were prepared.  By this time the Company's public
funds were exhausted; for the making of canals being then
in its infancy in Britain, the manner of doing the business
in the easiest way was not understood, and consequently
the work was carried on at a much greater expence than it
could be done for now, although the value of labour is much
increased.
