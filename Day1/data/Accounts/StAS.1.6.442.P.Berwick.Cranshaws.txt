   As the planting and raising of wood is of the greatest impor
tance to the country in general, so it would in this and the
neighbouring parishes be particularly beneficial to landholders
and tenants, not only as being the best mode of employing
waste land, but likewise from the shelter it could afford, i'
judiciously laid out, in surrounnding the valuable fields that are
already, or may yet be, improved for raising corp and hay.  But
the greatest advantage arising from it would be the shelter it
would afford to the slocks of sheep in winter.  Many farmers
in this part of the country have in one night lost a third, and
sometimes near the half, of their sheep by a heavy fall of snow.
The efficacy of planting for preventing losses of this kind is
well known to all store farmers.  The shortness, however, of 
leases in general gives had. encouragement to the tenant to
raise wood for this purpose at his own expence, because before
he could derive much benefit from it, his lease would expire.
It may therefore besuggested as in object worthy the attention
of proprietors in this part of the country, as they must ultimate-
ly be the gamers by an improvement of the kind, not only on
account security which it would as to the tenant for the safety
of his sheep in winter, but likewise from the value of the wood
itself; the soil, as appears from experiments that have already 
been made, being very favourable to the raising of different kinds
of timber.
