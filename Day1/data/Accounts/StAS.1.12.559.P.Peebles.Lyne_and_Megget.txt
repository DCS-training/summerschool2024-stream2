     Of Lyne and Megget.

   The number of sheep in both parishes is between 10,000
and 11,000.
   As during the summer there are 12 or 13 servants more
in Megget, and 3 or 4 more in Lyne parish, mostly females,
employed in milking ewes, making hay, etc. the population
of both parishes will amount, at a medium, to about 160*.
   There are no artificers nor mechanicks in either parish, ex-
cept 1 carpenter at Lyne, who has commonly 2 or 3 appren-
tices.  The rest of the inhabitants are wholly composed of
farmers, shepherds, and labourers, with their families.  Their
mode of living and dress is much improved of late, and they
enjoy, in moderation, the comforts and conveniences of life.
They are far from being illiberal in their religious sentiments,
and are truly exemplary for decency and hospitality.  All the
parishioners join in communion with the Established Church,
except 4 or 5 Cameronians, and sometimes 2 or 3 Seceders.

   Church, Stipend, Heritors, etc.-The church is an old edi-
fice, and appears to have been originally a Roman Catholic
chapel.  It was, till lately, in a state almost ruinous, but is
now undergoing a thorough repair.  It will afterward be a 
commodious place for divine service.  In Megget, their is nei-
ther church nor chapel of any kind.  Public worship is there-
fore performed in the different farm-houses by rotation, which
is far from being either decent or convenient.  The value of
the stipend, including the glebe, is about 83 L., besides the
manse.  His Grace of Queensberry is patron.  He also
proprietor of both parishes, except the farm of Henderland,
and a small heritage, called Lyn-townhead.  Lord Hender-

*No parochial register, either of births, marriages, or deaths, is to be found;
but it is highly probable that the population of both parishes has decreased con-
siderably, during the last 40 years.
