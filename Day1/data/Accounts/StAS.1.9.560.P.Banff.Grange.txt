     Statistical Account

here; so that the regular decrease of the average number of
baptisms in every 10 years, from the beginning of this cen-
tury, (the first 10 years only excepted, which, it is to be
observed, immediately succeeded the 7 years of famine,
during K. William III.'s reign), affords a strong presump-
tion, if not a positive proof, of a decreasing population.  That
the population has decreased very considerably since the
year 1780, is perfectly consistent with the incumbent's know-
ledge; for that year, the number of souls was 1980; in the
year 1782, it was 1875; in 1784, only 1760; in 1789, di-
minished to 1598; and in this year 1791, when an accu-
rate list of them was taken up, for the purpose of this state-
ment, the number of souls is 1572, of which 697 are males,
and 875 females; of whom
