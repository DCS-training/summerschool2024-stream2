     Statistical Account

stated parish, was no parish at all before the Reformations,
but that the other part, which was called the parish of
Skinnet, was a stated parish of very early date before that
period.  Halkirk, by all I can learn or conjecture, was
originally no more than a chaplainry, occupied by the Bi-
shop's chaplain, who also served the great family, that had
one of its seats at Brawell, a place very near the chapel, in
that capacity.  Here also the Bishop had one of his seats,
within a very few yards of the present manse.  It was
here, as I have it from report, that the Bishop, whose name
I do not recollect, was assassinated in a most shameful, cruel,
and barbarous manner, by a set of ruffians from Harpsdale,
a place belonging to the chaplainry.  These savages were
called the sons of John of Harpsdale, whom the then Earl
of Caithness suborned, as instruments very fit for the exe-
cution of that alarming and horrid deed.  The reason why
the Earl formed and executed this atrocious design was, as
it is reported, to be revenged of the Bishop for assessing his
lands in the chaplainry with an addition to the chaplain's
living.  This augmentation being very disagreeable to the
Earl, and of course to his tenants, roused their resentment,
and precipitated them into this shocking deed.  A most ex-
emplary and extraordinary punishment was inflicted on the
instigators and perpetrators of this murder, at the instance,
and by the special direction of King Alexander II. who, to
his great credit and honour, exerted himself in a remark-
able manner, in the discovery, condemnation, and pu-
nishment of these presumptuous culprits.  What is record-
ed in history concerning this affair, seems to corroborate
what I have from report; and from the concurrent testi-
mony of both, there is reason to believe, that this was the
noblest and most distinguishing action of that King's life.
But to return to the history of the parishes:-
