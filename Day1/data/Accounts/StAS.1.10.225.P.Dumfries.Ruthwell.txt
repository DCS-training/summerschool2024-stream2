during the winter.  The flounders are caught in what is cal-
led a pock-net, and sometimes the people grope for them
with their feet in the sand, and kill them with a spear; they
frequently weigh from 3 to 7 pounds, and are remarkably de-
licate.  The herrings are caught in long-nets, extended upon
poles fixed in the sand.  They are chiefly carried to Dumfries
market, and are sold, in a plentiful fishing, so low as 8 d. or
6 d. per hundred; they have however been scarce on the
Scotch side for these four years past, which the fishers ascribe

shore than formerly.  Cod and skate are taken in so small
quantities; that they scarce deserve to be noticed; on the op-

for wheat, 66 for potatoes, 30 for turnip, and 30 or 40 are
laid down with grass feeds.  The little flax that is raised, is

parish, have, within these late years only, sustained some loss
in their crops of oats, by a sort of blight or blasting, which is
first desocrnible in the end of July, and, beginning in the mid-
dle of the field of corn, extends itself on all sides, till it has
spread over the whole, the car is dried up, and the stalk
breaks down, and is not worth the trouble of reaping.  Dif-
ferent kinds of manure have been employed, without effect, for
the cure of this malady, and the people have also ineffectual-
