prish, besides supporting itself, exports a considerable, quanti-
ty of wheat, barley, and beans; but the light and soft
grounds being unfavourable for oats, a quantity of oatmeal
is annually imported.  Pease and beans are fown in Febru-
ary; oats in March; barley in May, and wheat in October.
The earliest harvest begins in the first week of August, and
the latest in September.

the wages of a man were from L. 4 to L. 5 Sterling per an-
