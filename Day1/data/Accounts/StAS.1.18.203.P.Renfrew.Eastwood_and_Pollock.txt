ment of land; and the manufacturer himself will carry in-
to this new line of business, that spirit of enterprize, and
those active habits, which distinguish him in his own pro-

   These observations might be extended to the general ef-
fects of manufacturers upon a nation.  Writers have com-
monly considered it as a settled point, that population must al-
ways increase with the increase of wealth, and that improve-
ment in agriculture must always correspond with the increase
of population.  But both these principles require great li-
mitation.  The population of a country does not ne-
cessarily increase with the increase of wealth.  Abundance
of provision, is without doubt a necessary requisite in or-
der to an increase of population.  But it is equally neces-
sary, that this abundance should be properly applied.  With-
out attention to this, no surplus may remain for an in-
crease of inhabitants; nay the abundance may prove the
mean of decrease and imbecillity.  A nation may in this
respect be in the same state as an individual.  A person
who is accustomed to a certain style of life, though he may
have abundance in the abstract, yet from his habits he may
consume upon himself what would have provided for a nu-
merous offspring.  He is therefore in the same situation
as if he were really in a state of poverty.  If he shall
marry, his habits and mode of life may be unfavour-
able both to the number and the health of his offspring.
While the labouring man rears ten or twelve healthy
children, the children of the luxurious, fewer in number,
are often reared with difficulty, and are at last both
weak and unhealthy.  This may certainly be the state of a
nation.  If from any circumstances, the body of the people
acquire a taste for luxurious living and dissipated pleasures,
or spend their days in unhealthy occupations, the nation may
