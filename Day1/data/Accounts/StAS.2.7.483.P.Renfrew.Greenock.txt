	sion is worthy of being records, both as giving a distinct state
	ment of the efforts made to ward off what the heritors and elders
	regarded as a last resource, namely, a legal assessment, and as in-
	dicating the causes of the failure of the two expedients of ` self-
        imposed assessment and quarterly collections. It is taken from
	a minute of that kirk-session, dated lst February 1812.
	   " On considering the state of the poor, the session find that the
        ordinary funds are deficient about L. 400; that the usual modes
	of supplying the deficiency, out of a fund common to the three pa-
        rishes of Greenock have been abandoned. Namely, an assessment
 	voluntarily entered into about twenty years ago, was abandoned, on
	account of a misunderstanding between the principal heritors of the
	landward part of the old parish and the smaller heritors and other
	inhabitants of Greenock.  Afterwards quarterly collections at the
	church-doors, and latterly voluntary subscriptions, have been dis-
	continued, because the burden of supporting the poor was unequal-
	ly borne, and the measure had sunk into utter inefficacy.  And,
	last of all, the again proposed assessment of the heritors and inha-
	bitants according to their means, to be managed as the subscrip-
	tion fund was, has been relinquished, on the alleged ground that
	each parish must assess, and apply its own funds to the main-
        tenance of its own poor. They, therefore, unanimously,
	resolve to fulfil the painful but only duty imposed on them by the
        law of the land.  In compliance with these laws, the sesshon ap-
	pointed their moderator, on the first Sabbath, to intimate to the
	whole heritors," &c.
	   Mr Wilson, quoting from a report of the committee for the
	management of the affairs of the poor, gives a statement of the
	receipts and disbursements under the plan of voluntary contribu-
	tion in 1810.
