     Statistical Account

The roads are tolerably good.  There are only 2 small
bridges, which separate the parish from the neighbour-
ing one on the west, both in good case, and lately
repaired, made and kept by the county.  The statute-
labour is exacted partly in kind and partly in money.-
Though the harvest was late in 1782, and the weather very
unfavourable, so that the prices rofe much above what they
used to be, yet it was not so severely felt in this part of
the country as in some others, owing partly to the dryness
of the situation, and to a considerable quantity of corn being
imported straight from the Baltic into the harbour of Kirk-
caldy, etc.  The poor had very liberal supplies.  Mr
Ferguson gave L. 50 to be distributed among them, and
the session, at the desire of the heritors, lifted L. 40, and
disposed of it to the same purpose, over and above their or-
dinary distribution.-There are 4 brewers in the town.
These keep decent houses, and good company.  But there
are several that are commonly called Trapsters, because they
fell ale to these brewers, that ar nuifances to society.-
Within these 20 years, above 100 new houses have been
built in the town.  About the one half of these are on new
foundations, and in the country part of the parish are up-
wards of 20.  Some still employ cottagers, and others do
not, preferring hired servants to them, and consequently
differ in their sentiments concerning the effects.
