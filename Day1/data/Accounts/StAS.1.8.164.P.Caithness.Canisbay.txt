windows.-Barrogil Castle is an old aristocratic pile; but, re-
newing its age apace, under the additions and embellishments
it is daily receiving from its noble owner.  The mansion
house of Brabster is old, and situated in the most inland part
of the parish.  The ruins of three ancient towers or castles
are still to be seen; one in Mey, another south of the
present mansion house of Freswick*, and a third situated on
the west side of the island of Stroma:  They are all built

   Island of Stroma.-The island of Stroma is situated in the
Pentland Frith, about a league from the shore of Canisbay. it
is a mile long, and half a mile in breadth.  It contains 30
families, 97 females and 73 males, and rents at about 120 L.
Sterling per annum.  It is very productive in corn; but the
inhabitants are obliged to supply themselves with fuel, from
the mosses on the main land.  The tenth sheaf was heretofore
taken in part payment of the rent.  This, with all other cus-

proprietor, at the desire of the people, into money.  There are
few discriminating features in the character of the Stromare-
ans from the other inhabitants of the parish.  They speak
the same language, wear the same apparel, and observe the
same customs.  The sea is one of their principal sources of
support.  They are dabbling in salt water from their child-
hood upwards.  From their political situation, and the sim-
plicity, sobriety and industry, natural to them, there are
perhaps few islanders on earth happier than those of Stroma.
They have a society school in the island, and they come very
regularly by sea to church, when the weather allows them to
cross the found.  On the weft of the island, there is a vast
