   Agriculture.-Though, like other parts of Lammermoor, the
lands are in general more adapted to the breeding of cattle
and sheep than the raising of corn, yet, on all the different
farms there are considerable parts of the ground under culti-
vation; and on some of them different kinds of grain, parti-
cularly early oats are produced, little inferior in quality to
those that are raised in the lower parts of Berwickshire.  The
chief object, however, that the skilful farmer has in view in
making use of the plough in this part of the country, is not
so much the immediate return from the corn he raises, as the
meliorating the pasture for his cattle and sheep, by sowing his
fields with artificial grass feeds, particularly rye-grass and
white clover, which thrive well on all the dry grounds that
have been improved with lime.  Those who have followed
this method, have not only been able to keep a much greater
quantity, but have also, by this means, an opportunity of
greatly improving the breed both of their cattle and sheep.  Tur-
nips are also raised on most of the farms in this neighbour-
hood, though in much smaller quantities than might be ex-
pected, as the soil is peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of
that useful plant*.
   Heritors, Stipend, etc.-There are 6 heritors in this parish,
none of whom, excepting one of small property, are resident.

*Price of Labour.-The wages of male servants who get their board in the

other perquisites, which may altogether amount to between 14 L. and 15 L.  The
