In those houses in which peat only was burnt, the bug never
appeared, though they were immediately adjacent to houses
where coal was burnt, and in which the insect prevailed.
   In the year 1759, when the coal was worked on Glencross
muir, and in Goukly moss, in this parish, the same thing was
observed.  The houses of the lower people, who only used
coal, were infested with bugs; while those in which peat and
turf served as the only fuel, were entirely free.
   The burning of peat in Edinburgh, came to be a sort of re-
ceipt against bugs, though it does not appear to have been of
much avail.  If peat smoak is at all a remedy against them,
it appears only to be so, where no other fuel is used but peat
and where the smoak is at lioerty, as is usually the case where
peat is burnt, to pervade the whole house.
   It is indeed remarkable, that the bug prevails only in those
towns and parts of Scotland, where coal is burnt; and that
it is unknown in the towns and districts, where peat, turf, or
wood, are the only fuel.  Some towns and villages of this
kind, though they have always had much communication
with Edinburgh and Glasgow, by means of goods, furniture,
baggage, and apparel, still remain uninfested with bugs.  This
would insinuate, that they possess some antidote against these
vermin.  That this antidote is the smoak of the peat fuel,
is not improbable; but that it really is so, has not been suf-
ficiently ascertained.
