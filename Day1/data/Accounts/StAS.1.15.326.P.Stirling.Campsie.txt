   In former times, particularly during a hard winter, it was
customary for wild ducks, wild geese, and even swans, to visit
the swamps of this parish; these being now drained, such
fowls are scarcely to be seen.  There are plenty of grouse
in the Campsie muirs; at the same time partridges have of
late become uncommonly scarce; many causes have been as-
signed for the rapid decay of this species of game, such as
the wet summers, and the pretended increase of the birds of
prey, which is not fact.
   Perhaps it will be found, that this country at present is ra-
ther in an unfavourable state for nursing patridges; the
broom, and furze, and briers, being mostly grubbed out, and
the land formerly waste, put under cultivation; whereas ar-
tificial shelter by belts of planting is not yet produced; while
the number of idle boys, belonging to the public works, let
loose upon a Sunday, strolling about the fields with their tar-
rier dogs, ferreting out the patridge nests by the smell, may be
an additional cause of the uncommon scarcity of this game in
the parish.
