with 63 stone weight of skutched lint being produced from
one acre.  There is, however, a great prejudice against this
crop in this parish; it is thought to exhaust the soil more
than any other crop.  The expences are heavy, from few
persons being acquainted with the different parts of the ma-
nagement of it; and there is no lint-mill within six miles
of the town.
   It is not easily settled what may be the average from
one acre of oats in the parish; I scarcely think it can be
called four bolls; from six to eight bolls is reckoned a very
weighty crop; but there are many fields sown with oats,
which do not pay seed and labour.  One farmer in this pa-
rish, who has lately taken a large farm of above 230 acres,
and has at present above 100 acres in his own possession,
candidly told me a few weeks ago, that from 12 bolls of
oats which he sowed last crop, (and that crop was in gene-
ral very rich elsewhere), there was only produced 20 bolls,
and of crop 1793, he had not three returns.  The soil in
general, however, is calculated to produce weighty crops of
oats, and of a good quality, and will seldom fail to do it,
unless when injured by previous bad management.  A
gentleman, who had a small estate within three miles of
the town, broke up a field of ley, which had been limed
about 12 or 14 years ago, and had carried some crops of
grain after it was limed; he took three crops of oats suc-
cessively without any manure; and in 1793, from the field,
which consists of six acres, he reaped 60 bolls; it was not
sown down with grass-seeds, but last year he drew above
L. 1 each acre for the natural grass, great part of which was
so luxuriant as to be cut for hay.  I do not mention this
with a view to recommend the mode of management, but
to shew the nature of the soil.
   I am likewise acquainted with another small field, about
two miles from the town, the produce of which, with the
