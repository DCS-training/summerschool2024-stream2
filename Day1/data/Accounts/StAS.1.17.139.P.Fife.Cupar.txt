   A more particular statement of the number of the inha-
bitants, ranked according to their different prosessions and
occupations, will be inserted, along with other articles, in
the STATISTICAL TABLE, at the conclusion of this ac-
count.

   Buildings, etc.-Cupar, especially when approached by
the turnpike road from the east, has the appearance of a
neat, clean, well built, thriving town.  The streets, within
the last twelve months, have been all completely paved at the
expence of the corporation.  There are no houses in ruins,
and none untenanted.  Upwards of a third part of the town
has been rebuilt, during the last 25 years, in a neat and
handsome stile.  Considerable additions have also been made.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The number of females, so much exceeding that of the
males, must be accounted for chiefly from this circumstance,
that the youth of Cupar, at all times forward to engage in the
military life, are many of them, at present, abroad in the ser-
vice of their country.  The population has advanced rapidly
of late years, owing to the extension of the linen manufacture,
and to the increased demand for hands employed in erecting
new buildings, and in carrying on important and extensive im
provements in gardening and agriculture.
