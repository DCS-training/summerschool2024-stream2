        Fruit.-Of the fruit, for which Clydesdale is famed, a large pro-
portion, nearly one-third, it is said, of all raised between Hamilton
and Lanark, is produced by the parish of Carluke. The land
devoted to this purpose is computed to be 110 Scotch acres in ex-
tent; the greater part of it being the steep banks of ravines, not
well adapted for any, otber produce. Orchard ground lets at from
L.6 to L. 10 per acre, especially if properly stocked with goose-
berries; and in favourable years the returns procured have been
very great. The extreme precariousness of the crop, however, and
the expense of labour, as well as the reduction of price occasioned
by the introduction of Irish and foreign fruit, has of late years ren-
dered the cultivation of orchards by no means a favourite object of
industry. The vacillation of prices may be judged of from the list
which follows:

The largest fruit-tree in Clydesdale grows in our parish on the
estate of Samuel Steel, Esq. of Waygateshaw. A respectable
fruit-merebant mentions that, about thirty years ago, he gathered
from it sixty sleeks of pears at 50 lbs. per sleek, the whole pro-
duce being thus 3000 lbs. Those who have seen its stately and
spreading limbs will readily give credit to our statement.
	The largest quantity of fruit procured in recent times from
one tree was obtained in 1822 from a Wheeler's Russet or Lady
Lemon apple-tree, in Mauldslie haugh, the property of A. Nisbet,
Esq. The produce was estimated at 35 sleeks, but, when mea-
sured, amounted to no less than 44 sleeks.
	The fruit-tree reputed the oldest in Clydesdale also belongs to
our parish, being a Longueville pear tree, in the park of Captain
Lockhart of Milton-Lockhart. Tradition stated it to be 300
years old.
