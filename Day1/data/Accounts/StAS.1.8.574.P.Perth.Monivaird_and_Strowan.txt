rish.  The arable farms are, in general, from 20 L. to 30 L. a
year.  There are a few tenants who pay from 40 L. to 60 L.

   Ecclesiastical State.-There are two or three of the Episco-
pal church, a few Antiburgher Seceders, two or three Bereans,
a sect of which Mr. BARCLAY, in Edinburgh, is the sounder,
and one Roman Catholic.  The Earl of Kinnoul is patron.
The stipend lamounts to 50 L. in money, and 2 chalders of
victual, half meal, half barley, and a glebe of about 7 acres.
A process of augmentation is now depending.  The manse
was built about 40 years ago.  In 1782 it was repaired, and
new offices erected; It is not certain, when the churches of
Monivaird and Strowan were built.  About the beginning of
last century, a party of the Murrays and Drummonds having
quarrelled, the former being worsted in a skirmish, fled for
sanctuary to the church of Monivaird, whither they were
pursued by their savage enemies, who set fire to the roof;
which was then thatched with heather, and burnt many of
them to death.  The church is now in very good repair; and.
though far from being elegant or commodious, it is at least
as decent as many of the churches of Strathern.

   Poor.-The number of poor at present on the roll, who
receive a stated weekly allowance, is six.  Besides these,
however, there are several others who receive alms occasion-
ally.  The funds for their support are the weekly collections,
dues for the use of the mortcloth, and proclamation of banns,
together with the interest of 72 L., amounting in all, at an aver-
age, to 24 L. a year.  There are no poor people in the parish,
it is said, who beg from door to door; and the few, who are
in very straightened circumstances, never apply for relief to the
parish funds, till they are compelled by dire necessity *.
