     Statistical Account

   The above L. 21, 10 s. is to be divided among the crew,
if they are themselves the owners of the boat and lines.
If they fish for an employer, who is owner of the boat and
lines, as is generally the case, then the crew shares L. 14,
6 s. 8 d. and the employer L. 7:  3:  4, when the fish are
cured with duty-paid salt.  If the fish are cured with bond-
ed salt, there is an additional profit of L. 1, 12 s.  This fish-
ing may be more profitable than has been stated, in the pa-
rish of Sandwick, but is seldom even so profitable in the
parish of Stromness.

   Lobster.-A couple of boats in the parish of Stromness
are employed in catching lobsters, which are sold to the
smacks, who carry them to London.

   Seals.-It was usual for a sloop to go once a-year, about
Martinmas, to the small isle or rock of Soulskerry, which
lies W. N. W. about 10 leagues distant, and there kill
seals, which resort to that rock in great numbers.  The
surge is so great around that rock, that it often happened
they could not effect a landing; or, if the men were landed,
they, and the seals, which they killed, could not be got off
but with difficulty, and considerable risk.  In November
1786, a sloop upon this adventure, from the village of
Stromness, was driven by tempestuous weather to the
North Faro Isles, and there wrecked with 22 men aboard,
3 of whom were saved, and 19 perished.  Since that fatal
accident, this perilous fishing has been abandoned.

   Sillock Fishing.-The most beneficial, and most generally
useful fishing, is that of the sillocks, a small grey fish, which
are caught in great numbers, from September to March, in
the harbour of Stromness, to which they usually resort for
food and shelter.  This is a fish of a sweet and pleasant
