reference to the number of hours, and other particulars, they are
of course under the operation of the late Act of Parliament. The
health of those employed in them is in general gnod, and the wages
which they receive are quite sufficient to secure them the comforts
of life, if they were managed with proper care. It is, however, a
matter of regret that families who receive so much for their labour
should make such a bad use of it. It is melancholy to see the
misery,that often is amongst them, arising from habits of intempe-
rance and prodigality, with all the other evils that proceed from
these sources, such as husbands deserting their wives and families.
There is certainly no necessary connection between this kind of
labour and habits of intemperance and mismanagement, and it is
to be hoped that, in the course of time, a progressive improvement
will be witnessed amongst them.

      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

  Market-Towns.- There is at present no market or market-town
in the parish. In the acts of the Parliament of Scotland 1686,
there is a warrant granted to Sir James Carnegie of Finhaven, to
hold two free fairs at the Kirk town of Finhaven, yearly, together
with a weekly market there. These seem to have fallen into dis-
use, as there is now nothing of the kind in the parish. The near-
est market-town is Forfar, distant rather more than four miles.
  Means of Communication.-There is no post-office here, but a
daily runner from Forfar to Brechin passes through the parish.
There are three public coaches that pass and repass during the
day. There are four miles of turnpike road in the parish in ex-
cellent order. There is one bridge over the Esk, and there are
five small bridges over the Lemno, all in good condition, and exe-
cuted within the last twenty-five years.
  Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is a neat modern build-
