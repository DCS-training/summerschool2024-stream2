heritors, and 100 given out of the consiscated bishops
lands.  The school fees are, each quarter, 1 s. 3 d. for reading,
1 s. 6 d. for writing and arithmetic, 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. for
Latin, and 3 s. for Greek.  Besides the stated fees, the
master receives some small gratuity, generally 2 d. or 3 d.
from each scholar on handsel Monday, or shrove Tuesday.
As session-clerk, he has L. 1, 1 s. of salary, 2 s. for register-
ing every marriage, and 3 d. for each baptism.  There are
5 other schools in different parts of the parish, taught by
persons who have undertaken that employment of their

Gaelic.  The number of scholars in these last mentioned
schools, from the beginning of November to the end of
March, is about 180.  The parochial school is the only

under the management of economical trustess, yielding an
annual income of L. 8, 14 s.  The annual amount of collections,
fines, etc. is, at an average, about L. 18, 10 s. so that the whole

be deduced the fees of Synod, presbytery, and session-clerks,
officers, etc. equal to L. 2:3:6; which leaves the revenue
of the poor about L. 25:0:6.  A considerable rise in
the collections at church, took place in 1788, when the
church was newly repaired and seated.  The heritors, ob-
