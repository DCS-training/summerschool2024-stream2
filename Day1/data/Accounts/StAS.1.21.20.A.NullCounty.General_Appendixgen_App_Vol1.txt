much away, and there are not twenty of all the differ-

   Servants.-As there is but little tillage, few cottagers are
employed in agriculture.  It is the opinion of the farmers,
that cottagers make the best servants; and that the family of
a hind, or cottager, employed to work in husbandry, is en-

people are much the same; but their stile of living is better,
and their dress far more gay, than it was 15 or 20 years ago:
this is observable in no class more than among servants.

seen; hares are also in great plenty.

   Language.-The people speak a harsh, broad language;
and here, as in most places on this side of Teviot, pronounce
many words ending in e like ae, as me, mae, with a long
