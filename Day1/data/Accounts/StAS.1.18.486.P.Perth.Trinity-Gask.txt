     Statistical Account

Manufactures have scarcely, if at all, found their way into
this parish; it contains, however, as many tradesmen as are
necessary, in ordinary cases, for the customary work of the
inhabitants.

   Fishings.-The river Earn, the only water of consequence

voluntary subscription, are not burthened with any pontage.

   Antiquities.-The only piece of antiquity worth notice, is
a part of the Roman road, or causeway, that runs from Stor-

more than a mile, in a straight line, occupies the highest
ground in the parish.  It is very complete, and, with little

It is commonly dry, even in the wettest season of the year.
The road, however, of which it makes a part, is but little
frequented.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Two small public houses, one
at Trinity Gask, and the other at Kinkel, are found to be ne-
cessary for retailing ale and whisky, for the accommodation of
