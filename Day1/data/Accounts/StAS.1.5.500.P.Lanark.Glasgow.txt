of the fortunes of the merchants in Glasgow was embark-
ed in that trade, and very large sums owing them, which
they were prevented from recovering, it proved the ruin
of many; and would have been fatal to more, had it not
been the great rise on the price of tobacco, which then
fortunately took place, which enabled those who had a
large quantity of that commodity, to stand the shock which
their credit at that time received, and to make up in part

present, being then supposed to amount to near 60,000
tons, yet it appears to be considerably on the increase, as
the ships belonging to Clyde in 1783 were only 386, and
their tonnage 22,896; whereas in 1790 their number
was 476, and their tonnage 46,581.  This loss, however,
in the foreign trade is amply compensated by the great in-
crease of manufactures; the merchants having, of late,
turned their attention more to improve the manufactures,
which had been begun among them, and to establish new
