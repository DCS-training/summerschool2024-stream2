24 miles.  But if the projected canal were carried to Insch,
it would be easily within the reach of the farmers of this
parish.

   Agriculture.-About 24 years ago the greatest part of
this parish was uninclosed and unimproved.  But at that
period, Mr Gordon, late proprietor of the principal estate,
began to improve his lands on a great scale.  Carts
from Aberdeen, loaded with lime, were hired to Inverury,
a distance of 14 miles, and Mr Gordon's own horses and
oxen went to Inverury, and brought the lime from that
town to Premnay.  The fields were inclosed and planted
with hedge-rows, and in general were thoroughly limed.
Proper farm-houses, and other necessary buildings were
erected; and the lands, after being several years in the pro-
prietor's own hands, were let to different farmers.  The
estate has since been sold at 60 years purchase of the old
rent, before the improvements commenced.  Yet the ex-
pence of improving the lands at such a distance from a sea-
port, has hurt the fortune of the intelligent and public spi-
rited gentleman who improved them.  It may here be re-
marked, that it is more prudent for a landed gentleman to
improve one farm, and then let it, and afterwards to im-
prove the other farms in succession, than to attempt im-
proving the whole at once.  Labourers cannot easily be
had; the price of labour is suddenly raised; the difficulty
of hoeing large quantities of turnips, of cutting down
and stacking large quantities of hay, and of harvesting
large quantities of grain in rainy, or in late seasons, be-
comes very great, especially where many of the labourers
must travel two or three miles to and from their work;
and a gentleman improves at a greater expence than what
is incurred by a common farmer, who is his own overseer.
