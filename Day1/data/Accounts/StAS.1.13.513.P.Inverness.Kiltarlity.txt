ed from the Chisholm's woods.  All these rivers abound
with trout and some salmon.  The salmon are kept from
getting up this length by the cruives on the Beauly, till
the end of August, when the fishing stops, and the cruives
are opened.  Then thousands of them get up to these ri-
vers to spawn, and not a few of them are at that time
killed by the Strath-glass people, by fishing on the said
rivers with spears and torches in the night-time.-Among
the hills that run along the S. side of the parish, which, for
25 miles in length, occupy more than 1/2 of the breath, there
are several mosses, some of them of considerable extent,
and about 9 or 10 small lakes of fresh water, situated in
deep hollow glens between these hills.  Eight of said lochs
abound with different kinds of trout.  The largest of these
is loch Bruiach, with a small island in the middle of it,
which lies about 3 measured miles S. W. of the church.
It is about a mile and a half long, and near a mile broad.
Four different kinds of black trout are found in it.  It also
abounds with a great number of the finest char found in
any loch in Scotland.  This fish is about the size of a her-
ring, and called, in Gaelic, "tarr-dhiargan." or the "fish
"with red belly."  Loch Neattie lies within less than
a mile N. W. of the former, and is about a measured mile
long.  In this loch is found a very black trout, from 10
inches to a foot long; it also abounds with very large
pike.  Loch Gorm lies 2 1/2 miles S. W. of Loch Bruiach;
it is only about a mile in circumference, but the best fishing
loch in the parish.  It is replenished with a very fine white
trout, about 10 inches long, but very thick in proportion,
and highly delicious.

   Wood.-There are upwards of 1200 acres under planted
