   The number of arable acres is about 3000.  The pa-
rish does much more than supply itself with the articles of
oat-meal, barley, beef, ale, whisky and potatoes.  It may
send to Dundee and other places,

   The people always sow as soon as the season and the
condition of the land permit; it must, however, be owned
that they reap rather later than some of their neighbours.
Harvest commonly begins about the 10th September.
There are about 280 acres in wood; arable inclosed, 550.
The land-rent is about L. 1400

   Church and Stipend, School and Poor.-The church is of
very ancient foundation, having been first built by Boni-
face, a legate or rather missionary from Rome, about A. D.
690.  The present fabric, however, bears no marks of
antiquity, and is but indifferent both as to style and con-
dition.  A few fragments of carved stones seem to indicate
that the original church was an elegant Gothic structure.
The stipend is about 2000 merks Scots, exclusive of the
manse and garden; as to the glebe, it would be, as it gene-
rally is in the country, rather a disadvantage, if the incum-
bent had not been so lucky as to get a small farm.  The
Crown is patron.
