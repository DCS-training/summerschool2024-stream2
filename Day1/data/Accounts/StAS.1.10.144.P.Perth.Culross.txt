tities of ironstone and some ochre; and, by the ingenuity of
the Earl of Dundonald, there have lately been discovered in
the crofts of Culross, adjoining to the town, extensive and deep
beds of a very valuable clay, equal, if not superior in quality,
for pottery and, glasshouse purposes, to that which is brought
from Stourbridge, in Worcestershire.
   Formerly, the coalworks of Culross were the most consi-
derable in Scotland; it being ordained by act of Parliament
in 1663, that the Culross chalder should be the standard
measure for Scotland; and the number of salt-pans then in

But his faithful guide quickly dispelled his fears, by assuring
him that he was in perfect safety; and, pointing to an elegant
