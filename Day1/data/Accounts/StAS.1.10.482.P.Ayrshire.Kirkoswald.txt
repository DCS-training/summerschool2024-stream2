and yard at 1 L. per annum, a cow's grass at 1 L. per annum,
and an acre or two of land, for which they pay something
more than the principal tack duty.  Some of them are bound
to work for their master during the harvest, for which they
receive the fee usual in the country; others are bound to
work during the winter half year, and receive their meat in
the house: During the remainder of the year, they are em-
ployed with the other cottagers in ditching and dyke build-
ing, and other labours of husbandry.  There is one particu-
lar species of labour begun to be practised in this country,
called Jobbing.  The farmers let the whole threshing of their
crop to these cottagers at 10 d. per boll, as it measures when
cleared of the chaff.  They also let the cutting down of
their whole crop from 4 s. to 5 s. per acre; and the mowing
of their hay at 1 s. 6 d. per acre.  Tradesmen and fishermen,
who have a permanent abode in the parish, with one grocer,
amount altogether to 73, and inhabit 59 houses.
   Thus, at the end of July 1792, the division and occupa-
tions of the inhabitants of this parish might be stated as fol-
lows:
