   Causes of the Decline of Population.-The population of
this parish, as far as can be guessed by multiplying the ave-
rage of births by 31 1/3 would seem, from the above Tables,
to have been, in 1677, as high as 2200/  From that period
there are three visible causes of its subsequent decline.
   1. One Unavoidable cause, was the overwhelming of the
populous barony of Culbin*, by a violent drifting of sand
from the Maviston hills; and, excepting a small remnant

<FOOTNOTE>

*The sand had been making great encroachments before it overwhelm-
ed the mains and garden of Culbin.  But that event, which completed the
business, must have happend considerably earlier than the date assigned in
Shaw's History of the Province; because it is specially mentioned in the
Act of Parliament, against pulling of bent, passed in 1695, entitled, for
Preservation of Lands adjacent to Sand-hill, and is mentioned as one of the
reasons for passing that act, K. Wil. III 1 Par. Ses. Act xxx.
