qually adapted to the purposes of husbandry when managed

   Cattle and Carriages.-The number of horses employed in
the parish is 139; of which 94 are kept for work, 28 for the
saddle, and 17 for carriages.  The carriages are 9 in num-

chaises are kept for hire.  The number of carts is 73.  The
number of milk-cows is 98.  Some individuals have been at
pains to improve their breed of cows, and with good success.
But cows are here kept less for breeding than for their milk,
which is sold in the town with great advantage.  They
are commonly fed in the house; the land near the town
being too valuable to permit much of it to be employed in
pasture.

   Rent.-The rent of land, situated near the town, runs from
three to four pounds the acre; and decrease, with the dis-

parish is cultivated by proprietors, the rent of the whole cannot

the town, extends to about 830 acres. Of these about 10
