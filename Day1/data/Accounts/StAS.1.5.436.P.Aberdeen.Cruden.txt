through which the sea dashes, when the wind blows strong from
the E. and which forms a beautiful cascade, in full view of
the drawing room windows.  One rock near these, is of the
form of a round tower, and seemingly set upon its base,
with a very open joint.  A famous antiquary, who saw it
this summer, is of opinion, that it will not stand much above
10 or 12 years longer.  Of caves, there are a good number,
but none of them very remarkable.  There are the remains
of a Druidical temple, upon a rising ground, about a mile to

be spreading abroad, and from the appearance of marl,
which have lately been discovered, great expectations may

acres.  There is seldom any sallow, till this year, that the
Earl of Errol has 20 acres.  Much the greater part of
farm work is done by horses; oxen, however, are em-

farms are all sizes.  From 16 or 20 acres, they rise to
