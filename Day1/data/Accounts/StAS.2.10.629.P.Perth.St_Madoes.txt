<TABLE=POPULATION>    III.-POPULATION.
  Although there are not any data by which the amount of the
population in ancient times can be correctly determined, there can
be no doubt that, looking at its present state, it has rather dimi-
nished than increased; for, from a roll of examinable persons, re-
gularly kept from 1596 to 1617, it hs evident that during that pe-
riod they were considerably more numerous than they now are.
Then, it appears, a large proportion of the people were huddled
together in five or six hamlets or villages, each family having a
few acres of land attached to their house. The majority of these
hamlets has long since disappeared; the land attached to them
having been thrown into large farms. For the last hundred years,
350, which latter is exactly its present number.

  Character of the People.-It has often been remarked, that the
inhabitants of the Carse of Gowrie are rather of a phlegmatic
temperament, and somewhat waiting in quickness of apprehen-
sion. In as far as the people of this parish are concerned, the writer
of this account has formed a very different opinion. Though a
stranger might be ready to mistake a coolness and deliberation a
manner by which they are characterized for constitutional heavi-
ness, or a little reserve for lack of itelligence, he who comes into
close and familiar intercourse with them are as much alive as men in
general to what is going on in the world, they are shrewd, sense
