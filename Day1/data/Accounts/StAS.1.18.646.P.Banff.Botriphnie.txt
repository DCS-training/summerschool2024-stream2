     Statistical Account

tholics; and 1 of the Episcopal church.  Population has de-
creased 1782, about 100.  This decrease is owing to the pover-
ty of the country, and the advance of rents; the poorer peo-
pie retire to the villages and towns where they are employed
by the manufacturers; and many of the young men find
more encouragement in the southern counties.
   I am persuaded there must have been some mistake in
the account of the population of this parish given to Dr Web-
ster in 1755.  The numbers are stated by him at 953.
   The list I have taken is very exact, and corresponds to a
roll of examinable persons, as far back as 1681, which I
found lately in looking over an old Session Register; the
number at that time, was 486, and it would not be too high
a calculation to suppose, that there might be 100 under 8
years of age.  Since I have been here, that is, from 1774,
the population has decreased about 100.  This is owing in
some degree, to the bad crops in 1782, and 1783, which re-
duced many of the farmers, and obliged others to go to the
neighbouring towns and villages.  But besides this, moss for
fuel is becoming every day more and more scarce; and heri-
tors restrict their tenants to a certain number of subsets.
The difficulty of providing fuel is one of the greatest obstacles
to the progress of agriculture; while our southern neighhours
are employing their horses and servants in the different parts
of husbandry, we are drudging from the beginning of summer
to the end of it, in providing at best but a very precarious
stock of fuel for the winter.  Were the duty taken off the
coals, we should then be able to provide them at a much
cheaper rate than peats, and in one sixth part of the time*.
   It might be mentioned as another cause of the decrease of
population, that the servants wages have advanced very con-

count was written.
