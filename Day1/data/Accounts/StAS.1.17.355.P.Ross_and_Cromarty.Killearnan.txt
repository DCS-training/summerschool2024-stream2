     of Killearnan.

   The stipend of Kilmuir Wester, and Suddy, and that of
this parish, are precisely the same, being nine chalders and
one boll of bear, three chalders and three bolls oat meal, and
ninety eight pounds nine shillings and eight pennies Scotch
money.  It is, however, marked by these peculiar circum-
stances, that the lands of one heritor do not pay a boll more
than they did anno 1695, nor those of the other proprietor
more than in the year 1721; and, however paradoxical it
may appear, the last is in fact considerably the gainer by the
quantum of stipend payable by his property.  It was pur-
chased at a judicial sale-a full fifth of the property, or what
is the same thing, of the rent, was previously struck off by
the Court of Session as teind.  While the purchaser was un-
der the necessity of taking a tack of the free teind, he was
of course not a shilling in advance for the exhausted part,
(i.  e.) for the lands paying stipend.
   But while the living remains, in statu quo, the minister's
portion of the property, (may not this name be given it on
paper)?  bears its proportion of a considerable augmentation
of rent, suppose 20 per cent.
   The glebe may be about 6 acres arable and pasture.  The
names of two villages in the parish, Chappletown and Spittal*,
corroborating some confused traditions, indicate the existence
of two religious houses at some remote period, one dedicated
to a Popish Saint, the other belonging to the Knights of
Malta.  There are at present none of the Roman Catholic
persuasion, nor any who profess to differ from the establish-
ed church, the Scotch Episcopals (who are rather more than
a fourth part of the number of inhabitants), excepted.
