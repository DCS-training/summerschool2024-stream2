do not yield near one half of the crops they produced 20
or 30 years ago, owing to the cold seasons.  Since the year
1781, there has been nothing like a good crop among us;
no peas, especially, came to any account since.  It is now
indeed idle, and appears fabulous, to relate the crops raised
here 30 or 40 years ago.  The seasons were formerly so
warm, that the people behoved to unyoke their ploughs
as soon as the sun rose, when sowing barley; and persons
yet living, tell, that in travelling through the meadows in 
the loans of Fearn, in some places drops of honey were
seen as the dew on the long grass and plantain, sticking to
their shoes as they walked along in a May morning; and
also in other parts, their shoes were oiled as with cream,
going through such meadows.  Honey and bee-hives were 
then very plenty, which, since the year 1782, are like to
be wholly lost, and extirpated out of the country.  Cattle,
butter and cheese, were then very plenty and cheap.  
There are people yet living in this parish, who have
bought young oxen for 15 s. 19 s. and L. 1, which now
would cost L. 4 Sterling each; good butter sold at 2 s. 6 d.
and 3 s. the stone; cheese at 10 d. the stone; and victual
at 2 s. 6 d. the boll.  Some of the abbots of Fearn's victual
was only valued at half a merk Scots the boll; and a
gentleman in this parish, about or within 30 years ago, had
a process for getting the current price for some of the ab-
bots teind-bolls, which was brought before the House of
Lords, and he lost it, being fixed at the old price of half a 
merk the boll.-In the years 1782 and 1783, victual got
up to an enormous height, hitherto unknown in this coun-
try; being sold from 24 s. to 28 s. the boll.  The poor
were partly relieved by the wisdom and generosity of the 
Barons of Exchequer, who sent 300 bolls of victual to the
Sheriff of this county, to be distributed gratis among the
poor of the different parishes, as the first relief; and ano-
