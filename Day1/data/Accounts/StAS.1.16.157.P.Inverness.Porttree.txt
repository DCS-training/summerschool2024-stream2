the late Sir James Macdonald, who died at Rome in 1766,
much esteemed and lamented, observing the central situa-
tion of Portree, fixed on it for the seat of the school, and
ordered a large and commodious school-house to be built.
But of the L. 25 granted by the Committee, five were
withdrawn several years ago, to make up a salary for a

of the sea, between the two forementioned rocks, lies a
green field, about 60 feet broad; and right up from that
field is a low and easy ascent, from the top of which a
large plain opens to the view.  Beyond this plain, towards
