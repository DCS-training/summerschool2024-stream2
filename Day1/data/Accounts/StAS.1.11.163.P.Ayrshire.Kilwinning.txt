were it not for these excessively high duties.  An object of
such importance to the commercial interest of Scotland, merits
the most serious attention of the British parliament.  Should
the Irish, upon an accurate and fair statement of the matter,
refuse to lower the duties on Scotch cotton goods, it is hum-

   Flax and Mills.-From 12 to 14 hogsheads of flax seeds are
sown annually.  The flax is spun and manufactured for the
various family uses of the inhabitants.  A very small quan-

bear or barley as could be easily wrought.  A little water was thrown upon it,
to make it part with the husks.  It was then beat with a large wooden mell, or
mallet, till it was fit to be used for making broth.
