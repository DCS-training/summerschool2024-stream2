ridge are by far the most valuable, and generally the best cul-
tivated.  The church stands in the centre of this district,
and contiguous it is the village, containing 44 families,
who are all lodged in poor, low, thatched cottages, excepting
the parochial schoolmaster and principal inn-keeper, who
have each a house, two stories:high, covered with blue
slate.  The village can hardly be expected to emerge from
its obscurity, since the great road which lately passed
through it, is now removed to the lower grounds, half a mile
southward.  On the declivity of the high rising lands, 400 yards
west from the church, stands the manse, which presents a
very extensive prospect to the South, East and West, and,
surrounded with wide, uninclosed sloping field of moderate
fertility, looks down on the richer plains below, as well
as on an agreeable variety of grown trees, young plan-

inclosures are in the South and South East quarters; most
of them are not sufficiently fenced for confining cattle; but
the few that are fully inclosed, can be let for pasture at 2 l.
an acre yearly.  The northern division beyond the high ridge
above mentioned, is intersected by the river Almond, which
reaches the parish at the bridge of Buchanty, washes its
North border for half a mile, and then runs through it a
course of two miles towards the Tay.  This river abounds
with a small kind of trout, and 200 yards above the bridge now
mentioned, forms a curious cascade, which naturally attracts
the travellers attention.  From the top of the rock on the
North side of the river to the surface of the water, where it
begins to fall, is six feet, the fall itself is seven, and the pool
into which it falls is ten feet deep.  The bed of the river be-
comes deeper and more contracted as it advances to the
