   Lakes, Fish, Water Fowls, etc.-There is one lake in this
parish called the Loch of Cotts.  Pike is the only fish it con-
tains:  In winter it is frequented by a considerable number
of swans, and, in the spring and autumn, by flocks of geese,
ducks, and other water fowls.  At the upper part of the
parish, there is another lake called Lochnabeau, partly in this
parish, and partly in Lhanbryd.  Lochnabeau is in the middle
of what was formerly an extensive bare moor; about 20 years
ago Lord FIFE planted the moor, and particularly carried his
plantations round the verge of the lake.  These plantations
are now far advanced, and by their vicinity to the water,
which is uncommonly limpid and clear, form a most beauti-
ful and delightful scene.

   Stags.-This improvement, however, has been attended
with one inconvenience.  In some severe winters, several
years ago, a few stags and hinds came down to the low coun-
try from the Duke of Gordon's forests of Clenfiddich and
Glenavon; of late years they have taken up their residence in
the neighbourhood of Lochnabeau, and the plantations a-
round it, and are become so fond of their new habitation,
that they have never returned to their native forests; on the
contrary, they increase every year, by breeding, and by the
addition of fresh emigrants.  There animals make a very
fine appearance, and afford much pleasure and amusement
to the sportsman; it is therefore to be regretted that they are
so hurtful to plantations and agriculture.  Throughout the
summer, they pasture in the night time on the corns; in the
winter on turnips; and in the spring, as the winter crops of
rye and wheat are then farthest advanced, they are particular-
ly destructive to them; but the items of potatoes seem to be
their favourite food, as they are known to pass through fields
of corn in order to brouse on them.  Upon the whole, is were
