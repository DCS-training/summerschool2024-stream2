neous matter.  The contents of the kiln must be made per-
fectly liquid, and somewhat resembling the metal in a fur-
nace; and in this state it is sometimes very difficult to pre-
serve it of the requisite purity.  The liquid requires to be
left in the pit to cool, which it generally does in about two
days, when it congeals and hardens into a solid ponderous
mass, which is broken and piled up on the shore, till an oc-
casion occurs to ship it for the market.  In a manufacture
of so great importance as that of kelp, every attempt should
be made to meliorate its quality.  This, it is believed, may
be done by cutting the sea-weeds somewhat earlier in the
season, and allowing them to lie as short time on the shore
to dry as possible, making the kilns so much larger as to
burn a greater quantity of kelp at a time; and of such a
construction as to prevent the intermixture of other mate-
rials, by raking it thoroughly into a liquid state, and by
conveying it from the kilns, as soon as it is cold, to a store-
house, to shelter it from the hurtful influence of the weather.
To increase its quantity is also an object of importance, and
to do it in some measure there is little difficulty.  The plants
on the rocks that afford this article, are seldom cut with suf-
ficient care; they are burnt only every two or three years,
when they might be burnt annually; too little attention has
been bestowed on the cutting of tangle and red ware, and
carrying it a-shore in nets and boats constructed for the put-
pose; nor has almost any person in this place attempted to
extend the soil for these plants, by placing broad weighty
stones, or even wrecked wood, on the shores, in convenient
situations.  Were these circumstances attended to, and the
practice hinted at followed, our kelp shores, which yield at
present so considerable a treasure, might nearly double the
quantity.  This parish produces every year about 120 tons,
