of them; and admitted by the chancellor of the University.
At his election, he is to be a magister in theological si commode ha-
beri potest; otherwise a licentiate in that faculty, cum rigore ex-
aminis; and within a year, is to be promoted to the gradus
magistratus in that faculty.

   Professors of Canon Law, Civil Law, and Medicine.-The
persons next in order to the Principal were, the teachers of
canon law, civil law, and medicine: all three, in like man-
ner, licentiates in their several faculties, (si doctores commode
haberi non possint,) and to be promoted to that degree within
the year.  The canonist's salary is equal to that of the Prin-
cipal; the civilist's 20 l.; and that of the mediciner 20
merks: each having besides, a manse, garden and glebe.
Their duty was to prelect every lecture day in their several
faculties, dressed in their proper habits: that of the doctor
of canon law was to be conformable to the sacred canons of
the alma universitas Parisiensis; that of the doctor of civil
law, the same as that of the faculty of Orleans*.  The elec-
tors of these three doctors were the same with those of the
Principal; only the students of divinity, cantor and sacrist
are omitted.

   Sub-Principal.-The sub-principal came next in order to
the doctors; and was elected by nearly the same persons with
the Principal, and admitted by the chancellor.

*Uniformity of dress took place so late as the days of King Charles the I.
That Monarch prescribed it in a letter from Laud, archbishop of Canterbury,
to the bishop of Aberdeen.  It is a black cloth gown, reaching to the heels, with
two bye sleeves of the same stuff and length, and a neck of velvet.  The dress
of the students is of the same form, but maple of a red or scarlet cloth.
