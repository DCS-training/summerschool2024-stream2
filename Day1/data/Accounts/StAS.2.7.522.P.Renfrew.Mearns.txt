	During the period from 1755 till the present date, the increase
has been somewhat more than 25 per annum. In the thirty-six
years that elapsed between 1755 and 1791, the total increase was
544, or nearly at the rate of 16 per annum.  In the ten years be-
tween 1791 and 1801, the total increase was 274, or at the rate
of 27 per annum. In the ten years between 1801 and 1811, the
population increased by 227 souls, or at the rate of 22 per annum.
From 1811 to 1821, the increase was 354, which gives the in-
crease at the rate, of 35 per annum. Since 1821 the increase up to this
date has been 805, which is with in a little of the total population in
1755. The, increase in this last period is at the rate of 40 per
annum. The number of births in the parish for the last seven
years is about 80.-of which 40 are recorded by the parish teacher.
The deaths are about 62 and the marriages 26. No regular re-
gister except that of births is kept in the parish. The procla-
mations are scarcely a proper test for the marriages that take place
in the course of a year. The number of children to a family is
about 4 1/2. The parish contains an unusually large number of
wealthy and respectable individuals, and of families of independent
fortune. These will  be seen by referring to the list of proprietors
with their properties, and the valuation of each attached. About
90 might be named as having upwards of L. 50 per annum. As
this is strictly a rural district, the people are characterized, to a
certain extent, by  simplicity  of manners, and by an absence of
many of the vices that are, more common and more fashionable in
populous manufacturing districts. The are nearly surrounded
on all hands with a manufacturing population, which is attended
with the advantage of affording them a ready and sure market for
all sorts of agricultural produce.

	Agriculture.-The soil, as already hinted, is of a light dry qua-
lity, quick and stimulating, and lies mostly on a porous, much
fractured and rapidly decomposing foundation of trap, gene-
rally termed in the west of Scotland rotten whin. There
are only a few exceptions, and these apply to some of the low-
er tracts of land in the parish, which rest chiefly on a hard till
or clay. Owing to the vicinity of the parish to the two great trad-
ing marts of the district, Glasgow and Paisley, there is a ready
market for all sorts of agricultural produce; and the manufactur-
ing, districts again, in their turn, yield the chief material for agri-
cultural purposes, in abundance of manure, of which the farmer is
enabled to avail himself from the comparatively small distances at
