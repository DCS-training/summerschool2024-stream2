   Many in the parish complain, that they are far from
school, and that their children are not able to go to it.
For some time I cannot say that it was well attended by
children near or far off.  But we have now got a school-
master of approved assiduity and care, and the number of
scholars has been doubled.  Last summer there were from
40 to 50 at school at the same time.  Soon after he took
up school in the end of last autumn, above 60 scholars en-
tered.

in the parish; 456 males, and 546 females, or 1002 souls.
