forms of religion are rarely neglected, even in those cases where its
power is little felt.
   Education.-There is one parish-school, in which are taught
reading, writing, and accounts. The average number attending for
the year is 30. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 25, with house
and garden. The probable yearly amount of fees actually paid to
the teacher is L. 7, 10s. and his other emoluments do not exceed
L. 2. All above six years of age can read.
   Poor.-The regular poor average about 7 in number, most of
whom reside in other parishes, but have their claim here. Provi-
sion on a small scale is made for their relief by collections in the
church after public worship on the Lord's day; but they are chiefly
aided by a compulsory poor-rate, amounting to  L. 20 a year. One
shilling per week is the usual allowance to a pauper.
   Inns.-Ale and ardent spirits are sold at a toll-house; other-
wise there is no inn in the parish.
   Fuel.-Half a century ago, peat from the Lurgie Loch and the
moors of Gordon was the principal fuel, and many of the cottagers
had their stacks of dried whins for winter use. At present every
one is furnished with coals, brought from Lothian or Northumber-
berland, a distance of twenty miles, at a cost of 10d. per cwt. in-
cluding purchase, draught, and other expenses. In addition to
coal many use wood for convenience or comfort, which may be had
at from 3s. to 6s. per cart-load, according to quality and distance.
