L.10 of the interest of which is to be given to the schoolmaster
of Cambusbarron. The rest of the interest is at the disposal of
the session for pious uses; and it is generally expended in edu-
cating orphans or children, whose parents are either unable or un-
willing to pay for their instruction, and in supplying them with
Bibles and Testaments.
   The late Mr Mr M'Gibbon of Greenyards left L. 200; and Mrs
Brotherstone of Touch, L. 50, to the poor, without any direction
or restriction as to the mode in which it was to be employed.
   Fairs.--An annual fair for cattle, held in June at Broxbrae, part
of the field of Bannockburn, is fast sinking into insignificance. The
annual fair held at the east end of Newmarket, in the neighbourhood
of Bannockburn, is on the contrary rising into importance;--a large
number of cattle, especially milk cows, and a large number of
horses, are exposed for sale. This market is attended by dealers
from Edinburgh, Glasgow, and all the country around.
   Ale-houses.--We have few places in the parish deserving the
name of inns, but our ale-houses and spirit shops are by far too
numerous; and they are very injurious, both to the morals and
temporal comfort of the people. To them may be traced a large
portion of the, crime, poverty, ignorance, and misery of the work-
ing classes of society.
   Fuel.--Coal is generally used in the lower parts of the parish
for fuel; and along with this, a portion of peat is frequently made
use of in the uplands. The coals are obtained at the different coal-
works in our own neighbourhood.
