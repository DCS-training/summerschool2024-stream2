about half a mile east of its present course, giving name to the
farm of Carron Flats, and encircling in its windings the Inches,
Easter and Wester. More recently, its course was north and west
of the town. Its bed in that direction may be distinctly traced.
To secure a ready approach to the canal, the river was straightened
by means of a cut. The alluvial matter, through which the Car-
ron flows, has been accumulated in a long progress of years, and
invites the labours of enterprise to convert it into fertile fields. It
was lately contemplated to reclaim the ground on both sides of
the river, and surveys have been taken, extending from Bo'ness
to Higgins Neuck, which hold out the stimulating prospect of
2800 acres of the richest soil.
  The distance from the quay at Grangemouth to the outmost
beacon at the mouth of Carron, is reckoned about a mile and a-
half. Vessels entering the canal were formerly conducted up the
Carron by pilots. About fifteen persons generally held license of
pilotage from the Trinity House of Leith. The occupation of
this class is now, however, superseded by the employment of small
steam-boats, which tow the vessels from the water mouth, thus
rendering them less dependent Upon tide and wind. Two steam-
boats are used for this purpose.
  Grangemouth was made the seat of a custom.house in 1810.
It extends over the out-stations of Alloa, Stirling, and Kincardine.
Its officers consist of a collector, comptroller, clerk, two landing-
waiters, locker, six tide-waiters.
  The following tabular views of the nature and extent of the
trade, convey a more correct idea of it than any description which
could be given, of the total number of ships, &c. &c.
  Number of Vessels which passed through the Canal during the
year 1830 to 1839, inclusive:
