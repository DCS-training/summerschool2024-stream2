          other part of the kingdom ; hence no temptation to smuggling
          would exist.  Another benefit would be a drawback on the duty
          of a limited quantity of tobacco, tea, and sugar, for the use of
          the fishermen, in the same manner as it is granted to merchant
          seamen.  The mail-steamer running all the year through would
          also be a signal boon, as bringing Shetland completely within the
          vortex of the British market, and no satisfactory reason has yet been
          given why this advantage, often solicited, has been withheld.
          The Isles of Man and of the channel enjoy many peculiar and
          important privileges; distant colonies are pampered; and it might
          not be unreasonable to expect some fostering patronage and com-
          mercial indulgence to be extended to the long neglected Shetland
          Islands.
