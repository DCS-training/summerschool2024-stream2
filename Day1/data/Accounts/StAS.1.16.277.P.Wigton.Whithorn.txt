   Ancient Church, and Priory.-Ninian, who went to
Rome in the year 370 was ordained a Bishop of the Bri-
tons, and founded a church here in the fourth century,
which he dedicated to St Martin*.  Of this churh, no-
thing now remains but ruins, and four Gothic arches,
which make part of the present place of public worship.

   Of bear, 16 chalders, 6 bolls, 3 firlots.
   Of meal, 53 chalders,'9 bolls, 2' firlots.
   
   As Kieth makes no mention of wheat being paid to the
Bishop of Galloway, to this Priory, or that of St Mary
Isle, to the Abbeys of Dundrenan, New Abbey, Saulscat,
or Tungland, it may be presumed that it was not produced

++Since writing the above a friend of mine informs me that wheat was
paid to the Abbot of New Abbey, near Glenluce, and founds his opinion
upon a charter of lands in that neighbourhood.
