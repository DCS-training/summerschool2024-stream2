   Coal, however, is reckoned the cheapest fuel to be pro-
cured, peats being very dear.-The grain produced here
is of an inferior quality, and sells lower than what is
raised in the more fourtherly part of the county.  Short
leases may also be ranked under this head, though they
are not peculiar to this parish.
