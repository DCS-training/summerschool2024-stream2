then erected in a new and centrical situation.  Calder, ac-
cording to one etymology, seems to signify water and wood,
from coille, "wood," and dor, "water."  The name Kirk-
newton appears to be derived from a village so called near
the old church, and about a quarter of a mile from the new
one.  The parish is about 4 miles broad, and 6 long from
N. to S.  On the N. it is bounded by the river Amond,
which falls into the frith of Forth at Gramond; and on the
S. it is washed by the water of Leith, which discharges it-
self into the sea at Leith.  There is plenty of lime here of
excellent quality, in different parts of the parish, which
is carried to many miles distance all around.  Several
country gentlemen have lately formed an association, and
opened a subscription, in order to explore the ground in
this and some neighbouring parishes, in search of coal.
This search is now making on the lands of Leith-head here,
belonging to Mr Swanson.  If this laudable and patriotic
purpose succeed, it will prove a great benefit to this part
of the country.  But as good coal is at a considerable di-
stance, it is hoped this disadvantage may be remedied in
another way, as a canal is now projected and intended to
pass through this parish between Edinburgh and Glasgow,
which will provide these cities, and all the adjacent coun-
try with plenty of coal, limestone, iron, &c. of the best
quality.  An excellent coal, which is most generally used
here, is brought from Benhaar, on the Glasgow road, 15
miles distant.  Coal of an inferior quality is to be got in
great plenty at the mines of Blackburn, Bathgate, and o-
ther places, at the distance only of 5, 6, and 7 miles to the
S. and W.  The price paid at the mine for coal is gene-
rally 4 1/2 d. a-load, 6 of which are a common cart-load, from
twelve to fourteen hundred weight, drawn sometimes by
one, and sometimes by two horses. Such a cart load from
Benhaar costs 7 s. Sterling.  The appearance of the parish
