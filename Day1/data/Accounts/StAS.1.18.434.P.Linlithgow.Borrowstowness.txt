years, it has been carried on upon a much more extensive
plan.  At present, it employs nearly 40 persons; including
men, boys, and girls.  The clay for the stone-ware is im-
ported from Devonshire.  The clay for the earthen-ware is
found in the parish.  Cream-coloured, and white stone-ware,
plain and painted, and brown earthen-ware, are the articles
principally manufactured.  A manufacture of soap belonging
to a company in the town, is carried on to a considerable ex-
tent.  It employs 6 men, and pays annually to Government,
about L. 3000 sterling.  Whale-fishing has been often and
long attempted; but without success.  It is now entirely
given up.  Herring-fishery was very successful in the Frith
last season*.  But as it is a new speculation in the place,
nothing certain can be said on the subject.  Small quantities
of flounders and whitings are taken during stream-sides, in
the run of Avon-water, west of the harbour, and mostly by
the coalliers who use hand-nets.  Some likewise are taken in
cruives.  It has long been thought, that this fishing might
turn out to much more account, were it followed with atten-
tion and skill, as good haddocks have frequently been caught
in the neighbourhood.
   Many of the women in this town, and the country around,
earn a comfortable subsistence by spinning silk, the waste of
Spittalfield's manufacture, sent by sea from London to agents
here, who return the yarn to be manufactured into stockings,
epaulets, etc.
   Coal and salt are the principal exports of the place, and
the imports are grain, timber, tallows hemp, flax, and flax-

*Those who are intelligent on the subject of this fishery, remark, that
according to the result of the best observation, the herrings after having set
into the Frith last year, (1794,-95,) in such abundunce, may be expected
to return in many future years.
