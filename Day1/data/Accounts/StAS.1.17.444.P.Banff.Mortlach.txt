     Statistical Account

and win the day: And a bloody day it is reported to have
been, though a glorious one, for Malcolm and his victorious
troops.  Some think that, for conveying its celebrity to fu-
ture ages, was erected the stately obelisk still standing at For-
res.  Certain it is, that soon after the Danes finally left the king-
dom.  There is an appearance, that the second and finishing
conflict, after rallying, happened a few hundred yards to the
south west of the Castle of Balveny; and probably the more
ancient part of that building was then in existence; for a
fort is mentioned as near the field of battle.  Perhaps it
will be expected, that the stratagem of stopping the course
of Dullan for a night should be taken notice of here, and
the letting it down in a prodigious torrent on the surprised
Danes, thought to have been drawn up on each side of this
little river, by which their army is said to have been divid-

may have been, and, from the present face of the ground, is
not incredible; for the rivulet runs, about an English mile
above the church, in a very contracted channel, between
high rocks; and beyond that there is a most capacious bason,
for the water to flow quietly back for a long time indeed.
But if such a manoeuvre was practised at all, it is more likely
that it had been on some other occasion than that of the en-
gagement just now related.  See Fordun, Boece, etc.
   As traditional and pretty sure memorials of this famous
battle, are pointed out;
   1.  The vestiges of an intrenchment, very distinct at this
day, on the summit of the little Conval-hill, called by the
neighbourhood the Danish Camp.
   2.  A number of tumuli, or cairns, supposed to have been
collected over the bodies of the fallen.
   3.  A huge and irregularly roundish stone, formerly, it is
said, on the grave of Enetus, but now rolled a few ells from
