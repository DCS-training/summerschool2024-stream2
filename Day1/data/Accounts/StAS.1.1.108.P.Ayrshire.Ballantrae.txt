   The wool of the sheep on those farms that lie between
the tops of the mountains and the sea is generally very
good, and of the short carding wool; what is beyond
them is more coarse and shaggy.  It sells from 7 s. 6 d. to
10 s. 6 d. per stone of 17 lb.  Scots weight, equal to 25 1/2
lb.  English weight; the average price through the whole be-
ing 9 s. for 25 1/2 lb. which is nearly 4 1/4 per lb.  This
shews the propriety of the farmers paying more attention to
their wool than is generally done; and it is believed that
there are few situations more favourable to an improvement
in that article than the first mentioned class of farms in this
parish.  Both the soil and the climate are favourable.  The 
soil is light, dry, and kindly, affording firm footing, a dry
bed, and proper nourishment to the sheep; the cool re-
freshing breezes from the sea during the summer, prevent the 
bad effects of immoderate heat upon the new shorn wool;
and the ground during the winter season is very seldom en-
tirely covered with snow above two days together.  If the 
farmers would take the trouble to introduce, from time to
time, some good wooled rams, and gradually cut off any
coarse wooled ewes that may be in their flocks, it is possible
to improve their wool to such a degree, as that instead of
the very best of it being now sold at 10 s. o d. it might
be sold at nearly three times the price.  This would nearly
double the profits of their sheep on the whole, and at al-
most no trouble nor expence; and it is perhaps the most be-
neficial of all improvements that they ever have it in their 
power to make upon their farms.
