ed and cultivated, agues were very frequent, in so much, that
in the spring, it was with difficulty the farmers could
carry on their work.  But now there is scarcely any such dis-
temper known or felt in this place.  Fevers were formerly
pretty frequent, and carried off several.  But they now occour
but seldom.

   Rivers.-There are two rivers which run through this
parish :  the South-Esk, and the Norin ; both of which run
on a gravelly bottom.  The water of Norin, in particular, is
remarkable for its purity and clearness.  The South-Esk rifes
to a great height, and at times overflows its banks to such a
degree, that the greatest attention is requisite every year, to
raise bulwarks, in order to prevent it from covering the adja-
cent grounds on every side.  The Norin, though considerably
smaller than the Esk, frequently comes down with such impe-
tuofity, that the low grounds, through which it runs, are often
greatly hurt by it ; which obliges the tenants to use every pre-
caution, to keep it within its banks.  These two rivers join one
another in the southern part of this parish.  They have both
their sources in the Grampian hills.-There is no regular
fishing with the net in this parish ; but there is, in the Esk,
plenty of salmon, salmon-trout, and burn trout taken with
the rod ; and, in the Norin, very fine burn trout.

   Produce.-A variety of culinary plants, &c. are raised
in this parish.  There are likewise a vast variety of trees,
such as ash, elm, plane, birch, beech, oak, chestnut, poplar,
lime, &c. and a great number of firs of every kind.  There
are excellent fruit trees of different sorts ; and some very
beautiful lime trees, not inferior, perhaps, to any in the is-
land.
