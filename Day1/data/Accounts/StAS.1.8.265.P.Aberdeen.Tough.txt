This district has afforded some instances of longevity.  Mr.
Durno, a proprietor in this parish, died about 20 years ago,
in the 106th year of his age.  One of the name of M'Gregor,
died in the Kirk Town, aged 105.  As no regular register
of deaths has been kept, the annual average cannot be ascer-
tained with that exactness which could be wished for; but,
it is supposed, it will not exceed 9, during the last ten years.
The annual average of births is about 15, and of marriages
5.  The only dissenters in this district are Seceders, of the
Burgher persuasion, of whom there are 127, including all the
children of those whose parents are Seceders *.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It may not here be improper to give some account of their origin in this
parish.  In the year 1760, the minister was desirous to introduce the new me-
thod of singing, which he found acceptable to many of his parishioner.  It was,
however, violently opposed by others.  The minister, notwithstanding, persisted
in his design; and this occasioned a schism among his hearers.  The rage of the
opponents was furious.  They soon began to think of revenging themselves
by leaving the kirk.  When the party was sufficiently formed, they built a
church, and a house for a minister, who was soon procured.  What is remark-
able, is, that there very Seceders have since adopted the new mode of singing,
which was the sole source of the original rupture.  Their present minister is the
second, who has held that office.  He is a very social good sort of a man, and
discovers a considerable degree of moderation.
