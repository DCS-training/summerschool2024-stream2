mon are caught, but in no great quantity.  The fishing, in-
deed, has not been prosecuted with much spirit.  In the 
bay or creek of Eden, the sea flows so high, as to admit 
vessels of 40 or 50 tons, many of which there unload bar- 
ley for a distillery, coals and lime for the neighbouring far- 
mers, who thereby save 2 or 3 miles of land-carriage, and 
are thus enabled in a few days to convey to their farms as 
much of these necessary articles, as formerly occupied their 
servants and horses for the greater part of the summer; 
which season is now spent in ploughing and hoeing.  In the 
east end of the parish also, are some small creeks among the 
rocks, where vessels of inferior size deliver lime and coals. 
St Andrew's Bay, until within these few years, abound-
ed in haddocks, with which 5 or 6 boats, 4 men in each, 
supplied St Andrew's, Cupar, and the north side of Fife for 
10 miles.  These haddocks were of a smaller size than 
those in the frith of Forth, but of a better flavour in the o- 
pinion of the people of this place; they formed the chief 
article of animal food to the poorer fort, and were always 
seen at every table; but of late this species of fish has al- 
most entirely deserted this bay, as well as many other 
parts of the eastern coast of Scotland; the cause has never 
been discovered*.  Lammas herrings have, in our memo- 
ry, been caught in immense quantities within this bay, on 
the coast of Kingbarns parish; but very seldom, during 
these last 20 years, has that fishing there been worth men- 
tioning.  The rocks, from the bottom of the bay to the 
eastern extremity of the parish, abound with limpets and 
periwinkles of different kinds; also with lobsters, and 
some varieties of crabs, of which the partan only is used 
for food.  The shallow water, over a sandy bottom, affords

*Some old people here say, that about the beginning of this century, 
the haddocks in like manner deferred this bay for a year or two.
