	The inhabitants of this parish are very regular in their attend-
ance at church. By the last census taken in 1831, the population
amounted to 1562, and on an average throughout the years, a con-
gregation, from about 800 to 900 person, assembles on the Sabbath
day in the house of God. With the exception of five or six
families, all the parishioners belong to the Establishment, and even
of those families, some are in full communion eith the church.
There are 764 communicants. Collection are ocassionally made
for religious purposes, at home and abroad; and although there
are no residing heritors, the regular collection for the poor
amount to about L. 62 Sterling yearly. From Whitsunday 1834 to
Whitsunday 1835, they amounted to L. 68; and in the year that
closed, Whitsunday 1336, to L. 75-shewing a gradual increase
very creditable to the people.
  Education.-There are two school in the parish. The paro-
chial school in the village is attended by about 100 scholars, and
the branches taught are, English reading, grammar, writing, arith-
metic, Latin, Greek, and geography. The salary is the maximum
and the schoolmaster receives the produce of a mortification, (left

<FOOTNOTE>John Chalmers, the last parts of his sentence was modified, and he was allowed to re-
turn to his parish of Ochiltree, under certain restrictions. Little is known of him
for may years after this time. He seems to have continued to preach notwithstand,
ing his stspencion, for we find, from the records of the kirk-session of Ayr, that he
supplied the Kirk with a sermon, 'and held session there January 10, 1625,' the pa-
rish being then vacant, He was appointed miniter of Ayr in August 1639 on the
translation of Mr Robert Blair to St Andrews, was received by the Presbytery
in the following November. Nothing of importance is recorde of him after that
time except the Administration of the Solemn League and Covenant to his peolple,
which was performed with great solemity in November 1643 died on the 11th
of June 1644.

of the Presbytery and University of Glasgow, and Wedrow's MS. Live of John Fer-

tion for the press under my care."-W. J. D.
