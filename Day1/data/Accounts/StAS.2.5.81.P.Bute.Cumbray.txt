unable to work and 4s. per week when confined to bed. There
is also a Provident Bank in the parish, instituted in 1836, from
which time till this date, (1840,) there have been opened 104 ac-
counts, with sums varying from 1s. to L.25,
	 Amountin in whole to                             L.1588  18  11
	 Interest till this date,                             77   1   5

        24 account have been closed, which with           L.1661   0   4
        Drawing on other account amount to                   799   4   0

        At the credit of 80 open accounts at this date    L. 861  16   4
	With Renfrewshire Bank,              L. 828 17 10
	In hands of the treasurer,               32 18  6
                                                        L. 861  16   4

        All the labour is gratiutious, so that the only charge has been
        about L.6 for stationery; such as pass-books, a ledger, and cash-
book, all of which will serve for some  years. Those of the people,
however, who are of saving habits, do not always confine them-
selves to the Provident Bank, but contrive to make the best of
their money in their own. They either become feuars, build a
small house, furnish it, and let it for summer lodgings, or they
procure a sloop, and become traders; in both of which ways if
they remain steady, they, improve their fortune.
	Poor and ParochiaL Funds.--The fund for supporting the poor
arise from the following sources: Collection at the church door,
which last year amounted to L.39, 2s. 8d.; proclamations, L.1,
10s.; mortcloth dues, 10s.; interest from the bank, L. 8,; 4s. 11d.;1
in all, L.49, 7s. 7d. The expenditure for the same year was
L. 44, 16s. 11d., leaving a balance of L.4, 10s. 9d. Besides this,
there is a small fund of L.45, left by the late Rev. James Adam,
minister of the parish, the interest of which according to appoint-
ment, is to assist in educating poor children.*
	The number of poor receiving aid may average about 25, and they
receive from 2s. 6d. to 6s. per week. From the above-mentioned
sources, the kirk-session, as managers of the poor, have as yet been
enable to support their own poor, and, therefore, have not needed
to have recourse to any other mode. In common with other pa-
rishes, they have to lament the decline of that principle of inde-
pendence which used to characterize Scotland and Scotland and Scotchmen.
Parochial aid is now claimed as a matter of right.

<FOOTNOTE>* Besides this, Mr Adam gave in his lifetime, L.250 to the Presbytery of Irvine,
for behoof of widows belonging to that Presbytery. He also left L. 100 to form
three bureuries which are managed by the Earl of Glasgow, the Professor of Di-
vinity, Glasgow College, and the Minister of Cumbray.
