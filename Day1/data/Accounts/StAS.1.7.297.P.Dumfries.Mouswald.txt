*The prices of provisions are always regulated here by the
market of Dumfries, which is only 6 miles from the center of
this parish; and most articles may be bought full as low in the
market as on the spot.  Labour is much the same price in all
the neighbourhood of Dumfries.  Servant's wages are more
than doubled within these 50 years; male-servants 3 L. 10 s. and
4 L. the half year; female-servants 30 s. to 40 s. for the same
space.
