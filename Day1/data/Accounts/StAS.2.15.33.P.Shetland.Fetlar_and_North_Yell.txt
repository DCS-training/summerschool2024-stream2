FETLAR AND NORTH YELL.

forms.  The examinable persons are 614; and the communicants
at last sacrament, the Sabbath after Fetlar, 39.9, all parishioners
of North Yell.  The communion forms are the only free sittings.
The manse was built in 1756, out of the vacant stipend ; re-
paired in 1805, again in 1824, and again in 1833.  Still, it is very
uncomfortable., exceedingly damp, being built in a morass.  Hence
the walls draw water like a syphon.   Neither books, nor clothes,
nor provisions will keep in it; and, although a good deal of money
has been expended on it, the minister has neither comfort nor pro-
per accommodation in it.
The glebe consists of 12 rnerks, and would let for L. 9.
The stipend is L. 180, including communion elements.  Were.
taxes, and expense of travelling to his church in North Yell, and
to Presbyteries, to be deducted, the minister's clear yearly income
would not amount to L. 150.
There is one chapel in Fetlar belonging to the Methodists.
It may be sid that all the families in both parishes attend the
Established Church, there being no families that I know, the whole
members of which are Methodists; but there are individuals to.
the number of from 20 to 30 in Fetlar, and from 10 to 15 in
North Yell, that are connected with the Methodists.  In good
weather, the Established Church is generally thronged; on. sa-
cramental occasions, crowded almost to suffocatiOD.
The church collections in Fetlar last year, including COMMU-
nion, amounted to L.6, Is. 8d.; in North Yell, L.6, 15s. 9d.
Education.-There is one parochial school in North Yell, and
one private; one Society school in Fetlar, two private.        The
branches , taught in the' parochial and Society's schools are,
reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and navigation.   The
parochial schoolmaster has the minimum salary; the Society
schoolmaster L.15. Their emoluments from scholars are small,
not more than L. 8 at most.
From an account taken as accurately as possible by the minis-
ter in December 1834, it was found that there were in
Fetlar.  North Yell,
Males under 5 learning to read,                6        4
Females do.                                  10         2
Males between 5 and li taught or learning,   Jos       76
Females do.                                  91        63
Males between 5 and 15 taught to write or learning, 36  .20
Females do.                                  17         6
Persons above 15 who cannot read,            17       la.

The reason that North Yell is behind Fetlar in education is
