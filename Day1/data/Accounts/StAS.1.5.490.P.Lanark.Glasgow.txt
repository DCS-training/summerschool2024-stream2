water to navigate to the city.  By the strength given to
the current of the river, by the jetties, and by the opera-
tions since that time, vessels drawing 7 feet 6 inches are
now navigated to Glasgow, and vessels drawing 9 feet to
Renfrew ferry.  The money expended in these operations,
with the interest thereon, amounts to upwards of L.50,000.
The first tonnage dues, that were levied, (from 1st July
1770 to 1st July 1771), amounted to L. 1021: 5: 1, since
which they continued to increase gradually until July
1790, when the increase became still more rapid.  From
that time to July 1791, they amounted to L. 2144, 16 s.
The next year they let for L. 2400, and this year (from
July 1792 to July 1793), they are let for L. 3205.  The
debt on the river is now considerable reduced;  and as the
tonnage is every year increasing, it is hoped, that it will
soon be altogether paid off.  As it does not appear, that
there are any rocks or great stones in the river, it is ex-
pected, that, by a continuation of the operations of dragging,
and erecting jetties and dikes, the bed of the river may be
brought to a level, from Dunglass to the quay of Glasgow;
and that, in the course of a few years, vessels drawing
9 or 10 feet water, may be able to navigate to the city.
   The See of Glasgow is said to have been founded about
the year 560, by St Mungo, or Kentigern, and afterwards
erected into an Archbishoprick in 1484.  The cathedral,
though by no means the most elegant or magnificent in
Scotland, is still a very venerable monument of Gothic ar-
chitecture, and the most entire in the kingdom.  It is 284
feet long, 65 broad, and 90 feet high within the walls, with
two large towers, on one of which a spire was built a-
bout the year 1420, making the height 220 feet.  The
church itself was begun to be rebuilt, in the beginning of 
the 12th century, and was enlarged by Joceline, abbot of
Melross, then bishop of Glasgow; and, from an inscription
