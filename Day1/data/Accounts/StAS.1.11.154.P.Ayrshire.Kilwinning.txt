of 16 pecks, yielded only from 10 to 12 pecks of meal.  The
price of the peck of meal that year, was from 14 d. to 18 d.
The parish produces grain almost equal to the consumption of
its inhabitants, though more than one third of it be in
pasture.

   Pasturage, etc.-In a wet clay soil, it generally takes 3
acres to feed a milk cow; but, in a light dry soil, 1 1/2, or at
most 2 acres, are sufficient.  The weight of a milk cow is
from 16 to 20 stones; the average produce from 4 l. to 5 l.
For grass to a horse, 50 s.; for ditto to a milk cow, from 30 s.
to 40 s.  There is a great quantity of sweet milk cheese made
in the parish, and of the very best quality; for which there is
a constant demand in Glasgow and Paisley, and of late in
Edinburgh.  Every farmer has one, or more, one-horse carts,
worth from 5 L. to 8 L.

   Potatoe Husbandry, etc.-Potatoes are raised by horse-hoe-
ing, and are planted at the distance of 3 feet between the rows,
and 6 inches from plant to plant in the rows.  The ground
is dunged at the rate of from 50 to 70 carts an acre.  It gets
5 plowings; the 2 first with 3 horses, and the other 3 with
2 and 1 horse.  The planting and raising costs from 8 s. to
10 s.  The potatoes are commonly raised with the spade, in-
stead of the plough, owing to the heavy rains, which generally
set in at the time they are raised.  The produce is from 30
bolls an acre, and upwards; the average price 6 d. a peck.  A
potatoe crop is reckoned an excellent fallow for oats or bear.
Lord Eglintoune has, under his own management, a very ex-
tensive farm, the greater part of which is of a light sandy
soil.  The high broad ridges are now reduced to low ridges, of
8 feet each.  One year before it is broken up, it is limed on
the sward, at the rate of from 80 to 150 bolls an acre.  The
