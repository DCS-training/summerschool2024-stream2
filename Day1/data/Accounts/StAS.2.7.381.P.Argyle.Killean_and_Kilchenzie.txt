     is gradually progressing to the south, and will, in all probability,
     ere long overrun the whole peninsula of Kintyre.
         Although a few roes are to be seen inn the woods of West Loch
     Tarbet, yet none of thein have found their way farther south, at
     least, on the west coast of Kintyre.*
        Ornithology.-Vast flocks of granivorous birds congregate, in
     the winter season, from the northern and woody districts of the
     county, to pick up such wild seeds as nature has liberally provided
     for their sustenance,-a wise provision ofthe All-bountiful Creator,
     not only to feed the fowls of the air, but perhaps to prevent the
     increase of noxious. weeds.
        Many migratory birds and some indigenous to Scotland do not
     frequent the district, which may be attributed in a great measure
     to the scarcity of wood-The following catalogue comprehends
     all the variety of this beautiful part of the creation which visit the
     parish, and may serve as a specimen for all Kintyre.

         Since writing the above, the mole has advancdd into the parish. It is a very sin-
     gulal circumstance in the natural history of the mole, that it travels by the hills, and
     colonizes the sterile districts before it attacks cultivated land.
