Statistical Account. They have changed the mode, as well as im-
proved the facility, of every species of carriage. Sledges, which may
soon become one of the objects interesting to the antiquary, were
formerly the best means of carriage which those in better circum-
stances could use in farming, and for other purposes. Now, almost
every poor man who cultivates a croft of land, has his wheeled cart.
   The greatest change has taken place in the liabits of the people
since the last Account. They are now very industrious in general,
and surpassed by none around them as willing, skilful, and active
labourers in all those kinds of work which the extensive and varied
improvements carried on in the county have supplied to its po-
pulation.
   The traveller interested in the comfort of the working-classes
must regard the cottages iii this parish as pleasing objects; and
their number, seen, as they often are, in picturesque situations, must
strike every observer, as giving life and interest to the scene pre-
sented to his view. In no part of the North Highlands, are there
so many well built neat-looking cottages as in the county of Suther-
land. Whoever sees them, must form a favourable idea of the
industry of the inhabitants, and of the encouragement afforded
them by the proprietor of the soil.
