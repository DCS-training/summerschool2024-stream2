     Parish of Glenurchay.

     Observation on the Statistical Account of Glenurhay,
     by Dr. Donald Smith, at Crieff.

   The Statistical Account of Glenurchay is well written, and
such as might be expected from our good friend Dr. M'In-
tyre.  I only regret that it did not occur to me some time ago
to give him for insertion the particulars of the engagement
in which the struggle between King Robert Bruce and Mac-
Dougall, lord of Lorn, was finally decided in favour of the
former.  It was fought on the western extremity of Dr.
M'Intyre's parish, where the found of Brandraw forms a
junction between the lake and river of Awe.  The ground is
well described by Barbour, one of our most ancient writers;
and the generous feelings with which the occasion might be
supposed to inspire the gallant lord of Lorn, are finely pour-
trayed.-When in New-York, I had the good fortune to be
conducted by ColoneI Allan Stewart, a gentleman of Argyle-
shire, in order to hear some Gaelic verses, from a very old
woman, who had emigrated from the island of Jura, that had
been composed at that memorable period.
