addition to such quantities of these articles as are produced
in it.  We need an yearly supply of about 300 bolls of
oat-meal.  Formerly, we required at least four times as
much.  But since potatoes have been introduced among us,
and have come to be generally used as an ordinary article
of food, we use much less meal than before.  In the
distillation of whisky, we use 1000 bolls of barley, above
what is produced in the parish.  But in return, we annual-
ly fell off, for the consumption of other parts, 400 wedders,
200 hogs, about 100 lean cows to the south country gra-
ziers in spring, and a great quantity of poultry.  We ma-
nufacture also a considerable quantity of whisky, for the
use of the low country.  But our staple article of manu-
facture and export, is linen yarn.

   Population.-The population of the parish of Logierait,
bears no unequal proportion to the quantity of its lands
which is cultivated.  It has continued nearly the same, for
these many years, though, on the whole, there has been a
decrease since 1755, when the return to Dr Webster was
2487 souls, whereas, at present, they do not exceed 2200.
