ther in the way Called runrig ; now, there is no such thing: the
land-owsers have laid out their estates in farms of convenient size,
Which are subdivided bi the farmer into four or five divisions, ac-
cording to his rotation.  Then, the ploughs were small and clumsy,
drawn by four horses yoked abreast, and driven by a man who held
the horses by the halters, and walked backwards; now, the iron
plough is universally used: and two horses instead of four.  Then,
turnips and clover with rye-grass were cultivated by a few gentle-
men only; now, they form a part of the regular rotation, even of
every one acre croft. then, there were no thrashing machines in
the pasish; now, there are five thrashing mills, and twn of them
built within the last two years.  Then, beef was 3d. per lb., but
vert seldom sold in tbe parish; veal, 2d. ; mutton, 2d. ; and pork,
4d. ; now, beef is 6d. ; veal Od. ; mutton, 6d. ; and pork, 5d. per
lb., and of these, especially beef and mutton, a great quantity is
consumed.  Thdn, a man-servant's wages, employed in husbandry,
were from L. 6, 15s. to L. 7, and a maid-servant's from I 2, 15s.
to L.3 a year; now, a man-servant receives from L. 12 to L. 16,
and a maid-servant from L.5 to L.7 with victuals. Then, the
yarn exported during the year brought a return in cash of about
L.2680; now, the return in cash will net amount to as many shil-
lings. Then, a woman who was a good spinner and employed in
nothing else would earn 3s. a week; now, a spinner has enough to
do to-earn the fourth part of that sum! Then, there were 24 li-
censed retailers of ale, beer, land other excisable liquors; now, there
are only, 71 Then, there were two distilleries of 30 gallons each;
now, there are seven, varying from I30 to 460 gallons each. Then,
there was no post-office; now, the Royal Mail runs daily through
the parish.  Then, there were no bakers, no butchers, no bankers;
now, there are all 3,- no bad indication of the favourable change
in the circumstances of the people. And a glance at the following
tables will readily show the more striking varioatonsin the narti-
culars of which they consist, betwixt the present state of the pa-
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac-
count:--
