land, one of the senators of the College of Justice, is pro-
prietor of the former, and takes his title from that farm.  It
is not easy to ascertain the real rent of the parish, as fines or
grassums are taken at the beginning of leases, instead of ad-
vanced rent.

   Instance of Longevity, etc.-The only remarkable instance
of longevity that can be remembered, is that of the late mini-
ster, the Rev. Mr. Johston.  Though his age cannot be ful-
ly authenticated, as the register of the parish where he was
born is lost, yet there is good reason to believe, that he died
at the advanced age of about 102.  In his dress and diet he
was very homely and simple.  Regarding the manners and
customs to which he had been so long habituated, as a model
for succeeding ages, in the decline of life he considered every
deviation from them as a corruption.  He had a strong anti-
pathy to medicine of every kind, and it is doubtful if ever he
made use of any in his life, except once.  He enjoyed a state
of health almost uninterrupted, officiated in public the Sab-
bath before his death, and was getting out of bed, in order to
prepare for the duties of the next Sabbath, when he expired
suddenly, in a fainting sit, without a groan.

   Poor.-There are no poor in this parish, nor have there
been any upon the poor's roll for many years past.  This is
owing not only to the frugality and industry of the inhabi-
tants, but also to their sense of honour, and independent spirit.
In establishing poor's rates, the design is certainly laudable, but
experience teaches us that they are attended with many bad
consequences.  Wherever men can depend on suitable provision
being made for them, when reduced to indigence, they are di-
vested of the proper stimulus to exertion; they soon lose the sense
of shame, and are tempted to squander away in dissipation,
