was put down. The establishment of a water police has stopped
the midnight amusement of black-fishing, although some of the
older inhabitants continue to believe in the medicinal virtues of
foul fish.  They are a sovereign cure for rheumatism and sundry
other ailments.
                      IV.-INDUSTRY.
With a fractional exception, the whole of the people are more
or less engaged in the occupations of husbandry, the parish being
purely an agricultural one.  Those who are engaged weaving in
the winter months, relinquish their looms during summer and au-
tumn.  There may be twenty families, however, who, during the
greater part of the year, are employed in weaving linen yarn sent
from Dundee, the great mart of our linen manufactures.  The two
following tables contain a great mass of statistical information, not
only regarding the present agricultural state of the parish, but re-
gardidg its agricultural condition fifty years ago.

           Wages, &c. 1843.

Ploughman's average wages per annum,
  6 1/2 bolls oatmeal, 1 Scotch pint sweet
  milk, and L.12.

  From the note on the other side, it
would seem that on the average there is
not much difference betwixt the weight
and price of grain (see Perth fiars of last
year) now, and at the period referred to
in the former Statistical Account. On
the farm of Coupar Grange Mr Archer
last year had oats, 46 lbs.; barley, 59 1/2
lbs. ; and wheat, 65 lbs, per imperial
bushels. But these are reckoned great
weights. On the other hand, it appears
that there is a greater average number of
bolls per acre grown now than formerly
-the best proof of an improved system of
husbandry.
