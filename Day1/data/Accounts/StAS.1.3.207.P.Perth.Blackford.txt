males;  all of them reside in the country, as there are no
towns or villages in the parish.  In Dr Webster's report, the
number is 1681.  Of late, several people have died between
70 and 100, two men past 90, and not a few past 80.  One
woman of the name of Seton, died a few years ago at Black-
ford, who, from historical facts which the remembered, was
supposed to be four or five years above 100  She retained
her faculties perfectly entire to the last.  Within the bounds
of this parish, there are 90 farmers, each of whom keep a
plough, and whole families amount in whole to 432 old
and young;  and including, servants, male and female, to 559.
But, besides these, there are 92 families, whose numbers a-
mount to 359, who live upon small pendicles of land.

   Productions.-This parish produces most of the vegetables
that are common in other parts of Scotland.  No wheat is
sown, except a little which Mr Haldane sows for the use of
his own family.  And it is but latety that the tenants have
begun to raise pease, as they are apt to be destroyed by our
early hoar frosts, while they are green;  and if the harvest is
rainy, it is difficult to save them.  Barley is more or less
the produce of every farm;  the kind generally sown is the
Chester or rough barley;  but oats are what the tenants prin-
cipally cultivate.  In some farms, they sow a good deal of
what goes by the name of gray oats, which are only valuable,
because they yield a pretty good crop upon our thin chan-
nelly ground, where hardly any other grain will grow.  Tur-
nips, when they are sown in drills, and properly managed,
grow to a very considerable size.  Clover and grass-seeds
also produce tolerable good crops.  Flax is raised in great
plenty, and is, for the most part, of a very good quality.  A
peck of lint-feed, in a favourable season, will produce be-
tween four and five stones of flax.  Potatoes thrive very well
