being formed of the sleigh which the river deposits on over-
slowing its banks, must be better adapted for the culture of
beans and wheat; and as the Kelvin, by the new cut which
is making, will soon be consined within its proper channel, it
is to be presumed, that the farmers will then make the most of
the excellent soil which lyes upon that river.  At the kirk of
Campsie, there is a haugh of near three hundred acres, ca-
pable of producing all sorts of green crops at least equal to
any in the county.* 

   Climate.-The climate of this parish, like every other part
in the West of Scotland, consisting of hill and dale, is exceed-
ingly variable; at the same time, there is reason to believe,
that more rain falls at the kirk of Campsie than in any of the
neighbouring parishes to the South and East:  Nor is it to be
wondered that the climate should be wet, when the situation

*Although the soil of this parish be so exceedingly varied, nevertheless
that part of it which contains coal and lime, uniformly appears to be clay
forming two belts of unequal breadth; the one upon the North of the wa-
ter of Glazert, is nearly a thousand yards in breadth, commencing about at
mile East from the church, and continuing all along the base of the hills to
the eastern boundary of the parish.  The other belt encircles the South braes,
and its breadth is somewhat greater; such is the appearance of the surface
in the Strath.  As to the Campsie Fells, which make about two fifths of the
whole parish, they run parallel to the Strath, from one end of the district to
the other.  The face of the hill is somewhat broken with craigs and glens;
the summit and back part is a deep muir ground, interspersed with most
hags; the soil on the face of the hills produces a short feeding grass, equal to
any brae ground in the kingdom; while the muirs are thought to be well
calculated for the rearing of young black cattle in the more marshy parts,
and for keeping stocks of ewes upon the drier ground.  In general, it may be
said, that the soil in the West end of the parish, and particularly North of the
Glazert, is most adapted for pasture; whereas the land on the South and East
side, seems fitter for grain.
