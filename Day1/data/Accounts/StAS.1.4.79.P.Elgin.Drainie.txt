   EXPORTS-were 20 cargoes barley and oats, at an ave-
rage, about 400 bolls each, and an inconsiderable quantity
or peltry.  The quantity of corn formerly exported from
this county, was reckoned, at an average, 20,000 bolls
yearly.  But it is probable this exportation will, in future,
be somewhat reduced, as the smuggling of foreign spirits is
now, in a great measure, suppressed, and whisky is sub-
stituted in their place.  Twenty licensed still are at pre-
sent employed in this county; and a considerable quantity
of the spirits is manufactured, and consumed in the high-
lands of Moray and Inverness-shire.

   Fishing Towns.-There are other 2 creeks in the parish
that admit boats, Causea and Stotfield; at the latter there
are at present 3 fishing-boats, which, with the 2 at Loffie-
mouth, are a vast benefit to the town of Elgin, and to the coun-
try at large, in supplying white fish.  The rent derived from
these fishing-boats is L. 5 Sterling each yearly:  But the
proprietors are obliged to furnish a new boat every seventh
year, which costs, when rigged and complete, from L. 18
to L. 20 Sterling.  The fish commonly taken on this coast,
are cod, skate, hollibut, haddocks, whitings, faiths or cud-
dies, with plenty of crabs and lobsters; but none of them
