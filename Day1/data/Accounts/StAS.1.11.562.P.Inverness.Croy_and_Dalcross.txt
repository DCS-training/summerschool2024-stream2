   Lake.-There is no running water in the parish that merits
notice, excepting the Nairn, already mentioned.  There is one
lake, called the Loch of the Clans; but for what reason it goes
by this name is not known.  It is about a mile long, but the
breadth is inconsiderable.  There are no fish in it, excepting
some pike, which are said to be so voracious and destructive,
as to prevent any other fish from breeding there.

   Soil*.-The soil of this parish, as might be reasonably ex-
pected, from the great extent of it, is various.  In general,
that on the sides of the Nairn is good, and, when well culti-
vated, produces good crops of all species of grain.  In some
small spots of the rest of the parish, the soil is likewise good;
but the far greater part of it is rather poor and thin, on a
cold hard bottom, producing indifferent crops, which suffer
greatly when the harvest is late or wet.

   Population.-The population of this parish appears to have
decreased considerably during the last 30 or 40 years.>

*With respect to the climate, air, prices of labour and provisions, as well as
the character and manners of the people, and a variety of other articles, there is
so very little difference between this parish and the neighbouring ones, of which
the accounts have already been published, that it is unnecessary to discuss them
here.
