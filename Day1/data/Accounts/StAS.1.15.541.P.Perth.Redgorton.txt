generally attended, the collections for the poor would be in-
creased, assessments rendered unnecessary in most country pa-
rishes, the gentlemen would thereby become more patriotic,
and their influence greatly enlarged.  However lightly they
may think of the present assessments for the maintenance of
the poor, which will every day increase, if no method similar
to the above is adopted, they will soon become as burden-
some as the poor's rates in England; which will consequent-
ly lower the value of their lands.
   If the Legislature would enlarge the glebes, and in place
of six, allocate to the clergy twenty or thirty acres of land,
it would be both advantageous to the incumbent and useful
to the whole country, by setting to public view a field well
cultivated, and that at no greater expence than could be af-
forded by the ordinary farmer.  But till this can be obtain-
ed, might not the heritors accomodate their ministers with a
few acres at the same rate that they would demand from
others, without charging, as a few do, an extra rent on ac-
count of the convenience, etc?
   To obtain favour in these respects to the clergy of this
church, would it not be an inducement, that the present in-
cumbents would pay a little more attention to what land they
already possess, and join with the utile some degree of ele-
gance; as enlarging their gardens, and bestowing some pains
on their cultivation, and, where the situation of the manse
permits, have a small lawn and shrubbery around the house.
It would be no great expence to plant an hundred fruit
trees or more, which in a few years would become profita-
ble.  I speak not from theory, out from my own experi-
ence I know a neighbour, who, by enlarging his garden,
has got a plot for onions which yields him from five to ten
