	From the state of the country after the Rebellion, the first se-
ven of these years may be omitted.
	Number of illegitimate births in the course of the last three
years, 14 or 15.
	During the last ten of these years, the average number of mar-
riages, in which both parties were in the parish, is about 3 1/2,
and of the others about 7 1/2, of which the half, or 3 3/4, being added
to 3 1/2, gives 7 1/4, the number of marriages corresponding to the
population of the parish. If we take 1 to 110, as the propor-
tion of marriages to the population at that period, and multi-
ply 7 1/4 by 110, we have 795 as the population of the parish.
It is not unlikely, and there is appearance on the register which
renders it probable, that the births were not registered so re-
gularly as the marriages:--we may safely, however, take 25
as not less than the average number of actual births between
1723 and 1732; and if we suppose 1 to 30 to have been the
proportion of births to the population, and multiply 25 by 30, we
have 750 as the population of the parish. These calculations
though founded on somewhat uncertain data, seem sufficiently to

moneth of September jai vij and fifteen years. This is attested at Conveth Kirk,
Febr.  1st 1716, by              (Signed)          "R. MORTIMER, Sess. Clk."
	Again in the minutes of session, "Sept. 25 (1715)-- No sermon here this day, in
regard of the confusion and disturbances in the countrie." There appears to have
been no sermon till February 19th 1716. The session had in the meantime taken
"care of the session box, with the money and papers therein, and laid it up in a se-
cure place," (minute of October 10;) and of date February 1st, there is the follow-
ing entrie: "The elders, finding that the box and cuppes are under the ground, did
think fitt to look them, to see if they were spoil'd: which they did accordingly, and
delivered the two cuppes to Alexander Cowie," (one of their number.) "to keep.
As for the box, they delay the ordering of it till Sabbath next,--but there being a
confusion in the countrie before Sabbath, the elders mett, and putt up the box in a
private place." "March 9th, it was thought fitt to lift the box and the cuppes, be-
ing beneath the ground, which was done accordingly."
