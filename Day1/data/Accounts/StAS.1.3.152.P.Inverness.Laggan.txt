     Statistical Account

   This is rendered the more probable, from the vicinity of the
parallel roads in Glenroy, already made known to the public,
which were evidently calculated for the purposes of hunting,
and must have been made by some persons of more power and
consequence, than any usually residing in this country.  In the
middle of the loch are two island, one of them much less than
the other.  On the larger, are the side-walls still remaining
of a very antient building, made of common round stones, but
cemented with mortar.  This is said to be the place where 
the kings retired from hunting, and seated on their game.
In the neighbouring island, which is called Ellans n' Cone, or,
The Island of Dogs, and said to be the place where their
hounds were confined, is also a wall standing of a similar
building.  In the middle of the parish, there is a rock, which
is upwards of 100 yards perpendicular, and very difficult of
access; yet, on the very summit, there are considerable re-
mains of a fortification.  The wall is built, outside and in-
side, with large flags, or broad stones, without mortar.  It is
upwards of three yards in thickness.  The area will measure
500 feet in length, and 250 in breadth.
