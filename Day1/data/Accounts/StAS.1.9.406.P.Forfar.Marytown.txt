man ocean.  To the south is Lunan bay, the red head of
Arbroath, and the prospect is terminated by the frith of
Forth, and the coast of Lothian.
   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The manse was built 4 years
ago, and is one of the best finished in the county.  The
stipend is 76 bolls of meal, 45 bolls of barley, and L. 19
Sterling in money.  The glebe consists of about 6 acres of
very good land.  The King is patron.-The schoolmaster's
salary is about L. 5 Sterling a year; and as the parish is
small, his perquisites are not considerable.  A new church
was built last year, which is both elegant and commodious,
and to the praise of the heritors be it spoken, not a farthing
demanded for seat rents; a practise by no means common in
Scotland, but highly worthy of imitation.-The poor are
maintained from the interest of a fund of about L. 500 Sterl.
and the weekly collections, which are very trifling, owing
to the greatness of the poors funds, the people not being
very apt to give, when they know that there is little oc-
casion for their charity.  These great funds are a loss to a-
ny parish.  They are the cause of a number of poor co-
ming into it, when they know that they will be maintain-
ed.  They tend to make the lower classes greedy and la-
zy, and to live beyond their incomes, and very careless a-
bout saving any thing to provide for a family, or to sup-
port them in old age.  They likewise put a stop to that
charity among the common people, which is the bond of
affection between man and man, and which tends more
than any thing else to humanize the mind.
   Manners.-The people of this parish, except 5 or 6 in-
dividuals, are all of the Established religion, and very regu-
lar in their attendance on public worship.  They are quiet
and inoffensive, and mind their own business; and as there
is but one alehouse in the parish, they are in general sober,
not being much led into temptation.
