     The Statistical Account.

   How valuable then is the study of the arts Indeed, with-
out exerting our mental faculties in the discovery of what
is useful, we must remain like the rude Indian, ignorant
wretched, and sotitary.  But the productions of art display
the fields clothed with verdure, and swelling with grain; the
ocean is covered with ships; splendid cities arise; the coun-
try is adorned with all the accommodation which the hus-
bandman can require; and the solitary forest is filled with
gladness.
   It is evident from experience, that nothing contributes
more to the improvement of the arts than the division of la-
bour.  But this discovery has unfolded an article of expence,
namely, the carriage of commodities.  If a man, by his own
labour, produce the necessaries of life, he saves importations
from his neighbours and exportations in return.  In short,
he lives within himself, and knows neither barter nor com-
merce.  But the division of labour has shown that in this;
state he can command none of the luxuries of life, and is
often exposed to a deficiency of its necessaries.  When an
individual, therefore, betakes himself to one occupation, and
perhaps to one branch of that occupation, he sells the pro-
duce of his labour for a piece of money wherewith he buys
all the other necessaries and luxuries of life from the diffe-
rent markets.  Hence the necessity of the carriage of com-
modities.
   The carriage of commodities being produced by the divi-
sion of labour, must increase with it, and become an object of
importance; and, as it is plain that a considerable portion of
the labour of individuals must be occupied in the carriage of
commodities, whatever invention tends to diminish that la-
bour, may be ranked among the useful arts.
   In rude ages, rivers, lakes, and every large body of water,
would be considered an obstruction to carriage; and the
