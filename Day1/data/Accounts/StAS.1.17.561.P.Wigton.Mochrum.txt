remove, as, not many years ago, would have been thought
utterly impossible.
   Parallel to the beach, the land, rising suddenly, forms a
steep bank or precipice, which renders the access from the
shore into the country, in many places, rather difficult.
Though there are various little bays, or creeks, where small
boats can land, there is only one place called Portwilliam
that deserves the name of a harbour.
   This port, though but small, is commodious and safe, be-
ing well sheltered by the land on the east, north, and west
sides; and if a strong wall or rampart, which has some time
since been begun to defend the south, was completed, it
would afford a secure harbour to a number of vessels, of at
least 200 tons burden.
   Few things, it is believed, would be more advantageous to
Mochrum, than the reparation of this port, because, being
the only one convenient for, or belonging to the parish, at it
all exports and imports must be made.  A little to the east-
ward of this, indeed, there is a small natural bason, called
the Rue of Doury; but here the access is difficult, the water
shallow, and the anchorage insecure, except in particular
winds.  At Portwilliam stands a neat small village of the
same name, which was founded by Sir William Maxwell of
Monrieth, about 20 years ago, in honour of whom it is
named.  It consists mostly of one row of low houses, well
built, covered with slate, and fronting to the sea.
   The inhabitants of every description are about 210.  In
1788 a small barrack-house was erected here for the accom-
modation of the military, and custom-house officers occa-
sionally sent to prevent the landing of smuggled goods.
This measure seems to have been attended with complete
success, as neither box, anker, nor bale, though not unfre-
quent before, are now to be seen.  The Bay of Luce every
