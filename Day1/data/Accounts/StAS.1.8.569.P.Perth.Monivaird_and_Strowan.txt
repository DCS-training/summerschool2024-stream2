though neither limed nor marled are uncommonly fertile in
natural grass, The lands, which are limed or marled, belong-
ing to Sir William Murray of Ochtertyre, are thrown into
regular rotations of cropping:  And the tenants are thriving,
under this system.  But the greater part of the soil is better
fitted to produce grass than corn; as much of it lies in sheep
banks, abounds with stones, and is liable to be washed away
by the mains when in tillage.  There are no commons in the
parish; and little muir, or waste ground, is brought into till-
age, except by the above mentioned proprietor and his ten-
nants.  Although a great proportion of the land is incapable
of being cultivated, yet there is enough of it arable, for pro-
ducing more than is necessary for the maintenance of its
inhabitants.

   Produce and Climate.-The principal crops are oats and
barley.  Potatoes and pease are the only green crops raised by
the tenants.  Turnips are only sown by a very few, chiefly
proprietors.  The soil of the parish fit for culture, when well
treated, produces excellent barley, which, all things consider-
ed, is found to be a more profitable crop than wheat, which
has been very little attempted here.  A considerable quantity of
lint is raised in the parish; particularly on the haugh grounds,
which, from their situation, receive an annual deposit of rich
mud; or on the spots of infield, which have been for some
years in grass, for the second crop; or in old parks, of good
and well-laid-down land, also for the second crop; and on the
most fertile of the outfields, which can admit of being
well watered.  In short, the propensity to sowing lint here is
so great, from the profits arising from it, that the more intel-
ligent proprietors restrict their tenants to a certain quantity;
as lint is very scourging crop, and leaves nothing behind for
recruiting the soil.-From what has been said of the parish,
