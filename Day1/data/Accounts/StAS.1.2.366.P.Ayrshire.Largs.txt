cle.  Of late, this congress has decreased much; because there
are many shops now through the Highlands; and travelling
chapmen frequent almost every part of that country.  Howe-
ver there is still a respectable concourse of rustic beaux and
belles, from east and west, by land and sea.

   Kelburn House.-Kelburn, a seat belonging to the
Earl of Glasgow, remarkable for the romantic scenery of
the glen behind it, is situated in this parish.  The glen begins
near the house, and about a quarter of a mile behind it, ends
in an abrupt, rough, steep precipice, over which a water
pours down, which then runs through a bottom below, no
broader than the water itself.  The ground immediately rises
on each side, and ascends mountain-high; at the same time
these two heights are very near each other.  The chasm, were
it naked, would be tremendous; but art has converted it in-
to a surprising beauty.  Both sides of it are planted, and co-
vered thick with trees; which have flourished so well, that in
some parts, a shade is formed, impervious to the rays of the
fun.  The water, in its course, falls, near the house, over an-
other precipice, 50 feet down, into a vast bason, that seems
scooped out of both sides of the glen.  A walk goes through the
whole, which is properly conducted to humour the ground.  The
deepness of the shade, the murmuring of the stream below, the
height of the ground on each side, the depth of the precipices,
the solemn darkness, so favourable to seriousness and medita-
tion; all together form a scene peculiarly awful.  All which
is still heightened, by the appearance of a monument of white
marble, erected by the late Countess Dowager of Glasgow, to
the memory of her husband:  Virtue, holding a lock of her
hair in one hand; and, in the other, an urn; over which she
pensively, and mournfully inclines, lamonting the loss of one
of her favourite sons.
