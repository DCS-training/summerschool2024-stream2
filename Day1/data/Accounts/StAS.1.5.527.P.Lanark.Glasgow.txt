     VIII. EDUCATION.

   As Scotland has been always honourably distinguished,
by the superior education of the lower classes of her in-
habitants, so this important article has had considerable at-

kinds; many of which, at the same time that they provide
for the instruction of the youth, also provide for their com-
fortable clothing.
