Denny, and thus intersects the whole kingdom.  To us they
seem to rise to a considerable heighth, and to form a natural
shelter from the northern blast; but none of them are more
than 1200 feet above the level of the valley, or 1368 above
the sea.  From the summit of the highest there is one of
the most extensive, beautiful, and variegated views in Scot-
land.
   The first thing that arrests the attention, is the amazing ex-
tent of prospect that opens all around.  At least part of 14,
if not 16 counties, and perhaps one half of Scotland, is un-
der the eye at one glance.  Though not nearly so beautiful
and variegated as that from the top of Benlomond, the view
is richer, and more extensive.  For, being nearly at equal
distances from the Atlantic and the German oceans, the
whole extent of the Island from east to west is viewed at once.
Towards the south and north, the prospect is still more ex-
tensive.  At a moderate calculation, the area of the whole
may be 12000 miles.
   The striking contrast between the Highlands and Lowlands
is the next thing that attracts the attention.  If you turn your
eye southward from the Frith of Forth to Clyde, and from
Pentland and Galloway to the Ochils and Kilpatrick hills, the
whole seems one extended fertile plain; or rather, like a
beautiful garden sheltered on all hands by the surrounding
mountains, and divided into numberless beautiful inclosures,
like the compactments of a flower garden.
   Nothing can possibly be a more striking contrast to this,
than the prospect to the north.  For 70 or 80 miles, it ap-
pears to be an endless succession of hill upon hill, overtopping
one another till they are lost in the distance of the prospect,
and blended with the blue clouds or azure sky.  In a foggy
day, or frosty morning, the prospect is truly picturesque.
Being raised entirely above the fog, the whole plain to the
