   Mills and Multures.-There are three corn-mills in the pa-
rish; the greatest part of the lands are thirled, or astricted to
one or other of these mills.  The multure, in general, after a
deduction of seed and horse-corn, amounts to about a twelfth
part of the crop; a servitude not only highly oppressive to
the farmer, but which has a tendency to prevent emulation
among the millers, in the execution of their business.

   Fisheries.-The Endrick abounds, at certain seasons, with
salmons, pikes, trouts, perches, pars, etc.  There is an ex-
cellent salmon fishery in Lochlomond, near the place where
the Endrick discharges into the lake.  As the salmon are not
now interrupted in their course up the Leven, as formerly,
the fisheries, on the banks of the lake, are likely to turn out

the people, and particularly the Dissenters, decline to have
them inserted in the parish register.
