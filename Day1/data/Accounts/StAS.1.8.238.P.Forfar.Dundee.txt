     Statistica1 Account

The rise of the wages of labour, has not hitherto produced
any considerable bad effects, even upon the common people;
but, on the contrary, has been generally employed to increase
their lawful comforts, to feed and clothe them better, and to
encourage them in the more early establishment of families;
and the proportion they bestow, in all charitable contributions,
at least equals, if not exceeds, that of their superiors in opu-
lence.  Yet it would be inconsistent with truth, not to men-
tion, that prosperity has introduced among some, a degree of
licentiousness unknown in former times; and one alarming
symptom of it ought not to be concealed, that, notwithstand-
ing the great accessions made, since the year 1788, to the
number of inhabitants, the number of annual marriages has
hardly received the smallest addition.  The people of Dundee
may be also characterised from their religious habits; and no
where in Scotland is public worship better, or perhaps so well
attended.  Their numerous sects indicate their zeal and at-
tachment to religious principles, and perhaps an excess of at-
tention to religious controversies; but these give very little
disturbance to the general harmony, and instead of increas-
ing bigotry they seem to weaken it.  Though some sects, not
only on their first rise but even at present, cannot be acquitted of
harsh and uncharitable opinions, concerning those who do not
adopt their sentiments, mutual toleration evidently prevails;
and each begins to suspects, that the dictates of their own party
have no better claim to infallibility, than those of others.
   As to the general size of the inhabitants, it is certainly in-
ferior to that of the people in the south and west parts of
Scotland, and even of their neighbours in various parts of
Fife: and though the linen manufacture be the great source
of their opulence and increase, its influence does not seem so
favourable as might be wished to health, or friendly to the
production of a vigorous and hardy race.
