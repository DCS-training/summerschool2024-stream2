     Statistical Account

2 bolls of barley, and 4 boll, of potatoes; besides the moss
ground, that some poor people have for 3 years gratis, for
potatoe ground+.  The stipend is only 50 l. Sterling, which is
all paid by the factor of Islay; as the whole parish belongs
to Mr. Campbell of Shawfield.

   Schools.-There have been 2 school-houses built here within
these 3 years, and both the schoolmasters are lodged under the
same roof, in a house joined to each of the school-houses.
The one is the parochial school, and the other a charity school.
Besides these, we sometimes have other 2 schools, at the more
distant corners of this large parish; and there is great need of
them all the year, if it were possible to support the teachers.

   Peculiar Privilege, and Consequences.-This island hath a
liberty of brewing whisky, without being under the necessity
of paying the usual excise duty to government.  We have
not an excise officer in the whole island.  The quantity there-
fore of whisky made here is very great; and the evil, that
follows drinking to excess of this liquor, is very visible in
this island.  This is one chief cause of our poverty; for the
barley, that should support the family of the poor tenant, is
sold to a brewer for 17 s. the boll; and the same farmer is
often obliged to buy meal at 1 L. 3 s. Sterling, in order to keep
his family from starving.  When a brewer knows that a
poor man is at a loss for money, he advances him a trifle, on
condition that he makes him sure of his barley at the above
price; and it is often bought by the brewers even at a lower
rate; while those who are not obliged to ask money until they

<FOOTNOTE>

+There is a very large quantity of moss land in this island, that might easily
be improved; if the poor people had it for 2 or 3 years, rent free, they might
support their own families, and be of great service to the tenants whose lands
are cultivated.
