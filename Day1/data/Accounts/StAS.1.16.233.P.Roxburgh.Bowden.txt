Soots.  There are only three other considerable proprietors,
all of whom occasionally reside, and about 50 small feuers
in Bowden and Middleham, who pay of teind, feu, etc. to
his Grace about 1-8th of the yearly value of their sub-
jects*.

   Cultivation, Manures, and Produce.-There were for-
merly 26 ploughs in the parish, each drawn by 2 oxen,
and 3. or at least 2 horses; and 10 or 12 drawn by 2 horses
only.  No oxen are now employed.  Some attempts to
work them by themselves are not likely to succeed; ser-
vants being prejudiced against them, and doing all in their
power to prevent this practice from taking place.  There
are at present 44 ploughs, each drawn by 2 horses, and both
driven and held by one man.  The change has not contri-
buted much to raise better crops, or to benefit the farmer.
The English plough, with the broad or plate sock, is uni-
versally used; though some are returning occasionally to
the old Scots plough, which is certainly preferable in stony
or strong clay lands.  Several mosses in the parish and
neighbourhood, abounding with shell marl, have lately been
drained.  Those in the parish belong to the Duke of Rox-
burgh, and the marl is used only by his tenants; but in
the neighhourhood, it is sold at 6 d. per cart drawn by one,
and at 9 d. per cart drawn by two horses, and can be car-
ried 6 or 7 miles to good advantage.  Thirty of the one,
or forty-five of the other, are laid on an acre of the sharp
dry land.  Strong clay lands require more.  Lime is also
brought from Mid Lothian, about 28 miles, at the rate of
12 s. per cart, containing nearly 3 bolls of shells, and used
in the proportion of 6 carts to 25 of marl.  Both contribute
