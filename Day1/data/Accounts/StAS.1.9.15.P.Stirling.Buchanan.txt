part of the country, is in the upper end of the parish, called
Benlomond, which is about 1080 yards above sea level.  The
ascent to the top of this hill directly west is steep, but from
the south it is more gradual, till near the top, and then it
is somewhat steeper.  From the top of this hill there is, in
a clear day, a very extensive view to the east as far as E-
dinburgh, to the south as far as Ayr, with the frith of
Clyde, and the islands in it, Arran, Bute, etc. as also to
the west sea and the islands of Islay, Jura, etc.

   Lochs or Lakes.-Though Lochlomond cannot be said to
be in any one parish, yet as the parish of Buchanan extends
14 or 15 miles up the side of the loch, and several of the
inhabited islands make a part of it, the greatest share of the
loch may be said to fall to the parish of Buchanan.  This
beautiful lake, lying from S. to N. has always been reck-
oned 24 computed or 36 measured miles in length.  The
breadth towards the south end is from 8 to 10 miles; to-
wards the north end it is not near so broad.  The north
end is considerably deeper than towards the south end;
the depth at the foot of Benlomond is about 120 fathoms;
in the south end it is about 20, and in many places not a-
bove 14.  All above Rowerdennan the loch never freezes,
however intense the frost be; but what is south of Rower-
dennen frezes, so that men, and even horses with their loads,
have travelled upon the ice, when covered with snow.  As
there are several rivers which pour a great quantity of
water into the loch, and as there is but one way by which
it empties itself into the sea, the loch, in rainy seasons, rises
to a considerable height, so that from it lowest ebb it has
been known to rise upwards of 5 feet.  In this loch they
reckon about 30 islands, but there are only 13 or 14 that
can be said to be of any valued the rest being very small,
