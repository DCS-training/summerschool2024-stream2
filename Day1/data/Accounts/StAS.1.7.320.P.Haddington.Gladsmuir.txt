   Besides the public parochial fund, the poor of this district
derive considerable advantage from private friendly societies,
instituted by themselves.  Into the funds of these, they pay
a small proportion of their weekly earnings, and receive a
comfortable allowance in case of sickness or distress.  This
is the most effectual method yet devised, for preserving the
industry, and at the same time relieving the wants, of the
labouring poor.

   Church and Schools-The church was built in the year
1695; the manse was erected 30 years later; both were late-
ly repaired, and are now in very good condition.  The pa-
rish having been principally formed by annexations from the
parishes of Tranent and Haddington, the King and Earl of
Hopeton, who are patrons of these two churches, are alter-
nately patrons of Gladsmuir.  The glebe contains between
5 and 6 acres of indifferent land.  The stipend consists of
34 bolls wheat, 35 bolls barley, 31 1/2 bolls oats, and 18 L of
money.
   There is a parochial school at the church, which is attend-
ed by about 60 boys and girls.  The master has a pretty
good house and garden, and 8 L 6 s. 8 d. a year as school-
master, which, with 40 s as session clerk, and perquisites on
registering births and marriages, together with fees of teach-
ing, make an income of 24 L or 25 L a year.  There are,
besides, two lesser schools on the north and south extremities
of the parish.  The masters are allowed 1 L 2 s. 2 d. by the
heritors, and teach about 30 children each.
