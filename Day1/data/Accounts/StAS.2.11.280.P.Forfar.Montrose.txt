whole may be said to be arable. The character of the soil in the
lower part of the parish has already been referred to. A conside-
rable portion of the estate of Borrowfield is moss, now completely
improved, and in a state of high cultivation; the higher grounds to
the north-west are thin and moorish.
	Rent of Land.--The average rent of land throughout the whole
parish may be stated at about L.3. Some of the acres in the im-
mediate neighbourhood of the town let at from L.6 to L.8.
	Husbandry.--The chief difference between the mode of farming
in this and in the neighbouring parishes is perhaps the greater
proportion of green crop which is raised,--grass and turnips always
finding, a ready market, and generally bringing a high price.
	The exact amount of agricultural produce raised in the parish,
it has been found impossible to ascertain.
	Manufactures.--The principal manufacture in Montrose is flax-
spinning and weaving. There are five flax spinning millS in the
parish,--four of which are moved by steam power; the other, which
is on the North Esk, is driven by water. On the same river there
are, in the neighbouring parish of Logie, other two mills connected
with those in Montrose. The steam power by which the four mills
in the town are driven is equal to 129 horse power. The four mills
in the town* produce annually 854,869 spindles; the two in Logid
parish, 302,224 ditto. Of the yarn spun part is manufactured by
the mill spinners, and part of it sold to other manufacturers. The
following is as accurate a statement as could be obtained of the
amount of cloth made here, or at agencies in the neighbourhood.
