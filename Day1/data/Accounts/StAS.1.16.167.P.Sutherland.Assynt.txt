bases of Edrachilish and Assint, lofty mountains.  At one
league's dstance from the inland end of the Kilis, there is
a particular part of it, called Kilis-cu-ig*, across which a
stone may be slung; there the natives swim their hardy
breed of cattle, from either side to the other, as often as
their business requires.  Advancing eastward a very short
distance from Kilis-cu-ig, the Kilis expands to a conside-
rable extent, and at length terminates in two lochs, viz.
Loch-glen du of Edrachilish and Lockumapool of this parish.
The herring-busses repair yearly to these, and the other
lochs of the Kilis, and seldom have cause to repent, as they
fall in with fish, are well sheltered on one or other side of
the Kilis, and have good anchoring ground.
   Lochunapool above mentioned, ends at Glen-cul of Edra-
chilish, the only farm in this quarter of the county belong-
ing to the Honourable family of Reay, and in contact with
Assint.  The boundary by land, through hills, moors, etc.
is somewhat differently represented.  The possesors of Glen-
cul say, that their march with this parish runs along the
long extended ridge of Bin-an-nu-i; on the other part, the
tenants of Unapool and others in this parish assert, that the
march lies at a short distance without the Ballach (i. e.
the slap or pass) of that hill, whence it directs its course
by Loch-poul-aulay+; from that lake, in an east direction,
by Loch-an-tlugid++ to Cloich-an-tnive^^, where the march
of Glencul-Edruchilish with this parish ceases.  The in-
considerable tract of moor above referred to, very seldom
or never is a cause of difference among the people; they
