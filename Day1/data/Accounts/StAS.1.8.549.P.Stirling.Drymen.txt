     of Drymen.

   Village, etc.-There is only 1 village in the parish, which
lies near the church.  The inhabitants are mostly tradesmen
and day labourers, who depend for employment upon the
neighbouring country, excepting a few weavers, who work
for the manufacturers of Glasgow.  There are Dissenters of
various denominations; but hone of them have a place of
worship within the bounds of the parish.  A considerable
number speak the Gaelic language; and there are 3 or 4 who
do not understand English. 

   Population.-Since the year 1756, the population of this
parish has greatly decreased.  This decrease is partly owing
to the prevalence of large farms.  In several parts of the pa-
rish, 1 family now occupies what was formerly in the hands
of 7 or 8.  Another cause of the diminution is to be found
in the progress of manufactures.  Though none of these have
as yet been established in this parish, they are carried on, at no
great distance, to a very considerable extent.  The bleachfields
and printfields upon the river Leven, near Dumbarton, are
perhaps the most extensive in Scotland:  and some large cot-
ton mills have been lately erected in the neighbouring parish
of Balfron.  These give employment to a great number of
hands, at wages so high*, that the farmers find it almost im-
possible to procure servants at any expence.

<FOOTNOTE>

*About 20 years ago, the wages of a man servant were about 4 L. a year;
they are now about 10 L., and frequently a good deal higher.  The wages of
female servants have increased in all equal proportion.  At that period, day la-
bourers received 8 d, or 10 d. a day.  They can seldom be got now under 1s. 6d.
As the prices of gram, and the other productions of the country, have risen
very little, the natural consequence is, that all the lands are thrown into pa-
sture, in which state they require fewer hands, and can he managed at less
expence.
