     Statistical Account

women of the lowest ranks in life; servants, cottagers, and
mechanics.

   Clocks.-Almost every house has a seven-day clock; and
watches are near as common as breeches.

   Progress since the Union.-Before the Union of the two
kingdoms, the glorious era of Britain's peace and prospe-
rity, there was not a sloop, ship, or vessel of any kind to
go to sea in, in this neighbourhood; but now we see their
canvas spread all round the coast, and importing from the
West Indies, and the different countries in Europe, every
thing tending to use, to ornament, or luxury.

   Wealth.-The trade and improvements in agriculture
have introduced wealth among the people; real wealth,
proceeding from growing skill and increasing industry.
This wealth has sunk the value of money, in a proportion
almost incredible, as will appear from the following tables,
shewing the ancient and present prices of provisions and
labour.  By ancient, I mean no more than about 60 years
ago.
