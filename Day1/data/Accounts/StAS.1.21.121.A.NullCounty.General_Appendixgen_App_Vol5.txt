year, which are called great Tuesdays, or muckle markets;
one on the first Tuesday after Martinmas, another on Palm
Tuesday the third on the first Tuesday after Trinity fair,
and the fourth on the first Tuesday after Lammas fair.  These
are foot markets, standing on the public street, which is at
that time crowded with merchants' stands, exposing for sale
many different commodities.  This occasions a vast resort of
people from the neighbouring parishes, expecting to purchase
a variety of articles from the stands or tents of the chapmen
at a cheaper rate than from the merchants' shops.
   There is a salmon fishing on the Southesk, the property
of the Hon. William Maule of Panmure.  It is rented at
present at L. 15 a-year; and the average sale, as I am in-
formed, will be from L. 60 to L. 100.
   In the year 1785, a brewery was erected at the end of the
nether tenements, near the bridge, with every apparatus ne-
cessary for the purpose.  It has been very successful; fur-
nishing ale and beer, not only to the people of Brechin, but
to all the neighbouring parishes, some of them at a consi-
derable distance.
   In the year 1786, a distillery was erected at the north port,
for distilling spirits from malt.  The whisky, or aquavit‘,
distilled here, is remarkably fine, and greatly run after, not
only by the people here, but by the whole country round.
Their yearly profits, I presume, are very considerable: but
from any information I have as yet received, I am not able
to ascertain them.
   A distillery of the same kind was let a-going very lately
at the east end of the Cadger-wynd, and promises to do well.
   The yarn and the coarse linen, commonly called Osna-
burgs, is a branch of trade in which most of our merchants
are at present engaged.
   A cotton manufactory was established here in March 1786.
