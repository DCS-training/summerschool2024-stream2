tenants to reside in them." An improved system of husbandry
seems to have commenced about that time, so that the "grain
produced was increased fourfold in the courseef twenty-six years
there after."
	During the last thirty years, great additions have been made
to the cultivated land of the parish, by cultivating wastes, drain-
ing mosses, marshes, &c.; the enclosures mentioned have been
made, and almost all the wood has been planted.
	From the plan alluded to, of Lord Panmure's part of the pa-
rish, it appears that, from 800 to 900 acres have been added since
1770 to the cultivated land, upon that part; and there is every
reason to believe that, on the other parts of the parish, the acces-
sion has been proportionably great. And while the parish in ge-
neral, from the nature of its subsoil, requires much draining, it for-
tunately abounds in the most suitable materials for this purpose;
an advantage which the tenantry have not failed to improve; by
which means, not nnly is its produce considerably increased, but
its climate also is materially improved. The productiveness of its
soil might indeed be still further increased, were it in the vicinity
of a town where a supply of street manure could be procured; but
the price of that article in Arbroath (the nearest town) is so high,
and the distance so considerable, that though this plan has been
attempted, it is not likely to be followed out to any extent, or that
it would be attended with any advantage sufficiently remunerat-
ing.
	But improved as the parish is, and might still further be in its,
soil, climate and productiveness, it must still continue, as is the
case at present, inferior in these respects to most of the adjacent
districts, owing to certain obstacles arising not from any want of
encouragement on the part of the landlord, nor of capital or skill
on the part of the tenant, but from its high and exposed situation,
and from its cold and retentive subsoil. Hence our spring opera-
tions are retarded--the young grass is apt to he thrown out--vege-
tation is late in commencing, never making much progress till to-
wards the end of June: our harvest in general is about a fortnight
later and therefore more precarious, and the quality of our grain,
particular of our wheat and barley, thereby considerably dete-
riorated.
	Quarries.--V`rhous quarries of excellent materials for common
purposes, are worked in the parish; but, so far as has yet been dis-
covered, the state affording pavement and slate do not extend
