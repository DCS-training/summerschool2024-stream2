   State of Agriculture and Manufactures.-Such is the general
state of agricultural knowledge that most farmers, and even
crofters, are disposed, as they are usually bound by their tenures,
to observe, from beginning to end of their leases, a regular plan of
tillage.  A five-course shift was the one that for some time till of
late, was most in vogue, viz. first year, oats from lea; second, tur-
nip, potatoes, and, when the manure failed, naked fallow; third,
barley, oats, or sometimes wheat, with a due quantity of clover and
rye-grass seeds; fourth, hay or pasture; and fifth, pasture. Some
tenants had, besides these lots, another section, at least, a paddock
