different method of management is beginning to give a
very different appearance to the arable part of the parish.
Poor pasture is annually giving place to fields covered
with clover and rye-grass; and gray oats are succeeded by
white, which return double the quantity of meal.  There
is, however, something in the nature of the soil which
tends to degenerate oats; for white oats will, in the course
of 5 years, have a mixture of gray, even when kept up-
on the best improven land.  An annual change of seed,
from wet to dry land, and vice versa, was tried, but did
not succeed above 7 years: the 8th year, there was a
small quantity of gray; and the 9th, there was at least
one-third gray oats, though the land on which the expe-
riment was made in the 8th and 9th years was in as good
heart as any of it had been in the preceding years.  The
frequent change of seed from a deeper soil, is, perhaps,
the only certain method by which the loss arising from
gray oats can be avoided.  The means of improvement is
lime imported from England, and sea-shells from the bay
of Wigton.  The shells succeed well; but, from the ex-
pense of labour, 20 tons at least being required to an acre,
it is only those who are near the landing ports who have
tried them.  In 1790 about 16,000 Carlisle bushels of
lime were landed in the different ports.  A Carlisle bushel
is equal to 3 Winchester's; and 50 Carlisle bushels of un-
slacked lime has hitherto been considered as a proper quan-
tity for 1 acre; but from 40 to 45 bushels, according to
the nature of the soil, with a proportional dressing upon a
second going round, would, in all probability, answer the
purpose better; for upon this coast, so subject to wet sea-
sons, the almost invariable consequence, from the 50

was thought high-rented at 12 L. a-year then paid 12 bolls of each.
