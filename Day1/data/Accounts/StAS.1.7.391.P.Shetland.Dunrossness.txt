     NUMBER XXXIX.

     PARISH OF DUNROSSNESS IN ZETLAND.

     (County of Orkney.-Presbytery of Zetland.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN MILL.

     Name and Situation.

   DUNROSSNESS means the hill of the promontory of
Ross.  This parish is on the southern extremity of
Zetland.  It is a peninsula washed by the sea on three sides,
and is comparatively the most fertile district in the Zetland
Isles.  Two other parishes are united with Dunrossness, un-
der the charge of the same minister.  These are Sandwick,
which means the Sandy-bay; and Cunningsburgh, the same
name with Koningsberg, which, in the Norse or Scandina-
vian language, means Kingsburgh.

   Soil, Air, and Produce.-The soil in the arable parts of the
parish is various.  In some places sandy; in others loam and
clay.-Considerable tracks are of moss, and consequently of
little value.  The air is moist in a great degree, but by no
means unhealthy.  Many of the people live to a great age-
some to 100 years and upwards.  The hills in this parish
are green, and the land for the most part firm.  By these
circumstances it is rendered more valuable, as well as a more
agreeable residence, than the black mountains and morasses
