   Manufacture.-The only manufacture is the knitting of
stockings, in which all the women are employed, and some
of the boys and even old men.  It is supposed, that this ar-
ticle may yield to the parish about 400 L. Sterling.  The hose
are of that coarse kind, which bring for working the pair 12
or 14 pence Sterling; and some of the women will knit two
pairs, or two pairs and a half in the week.  If it were not
for this last article, the rents of the small crofts could not be
paid, as the crofters have no other way of earning money, but
by annually rearing a young ox or cow.

   Exports and Cattle.-There is annually about 200 bolls of
meal carried out of this parish to the Aberdeen market; and,
as nearly as can be found, 180 cattle, young and old, bought
up and driven to the south country, by dealers in that arti-
ticle, worth at an average 3 L. a head.  There are very few
horses reared, and not above 200 sheep kept in the parish.

   Proprietors, Rents, etc.-The gross rent of the whole parish
in money, and meal at 10 s. per boll, is about 1300 L. Sterling,
and the valued rent 2544 L. Scotch.  The proprietors are Alex-
ander Leith of Freefield, James Horn EIphinstone of Logie,
John Forbes of Blackford, Alexander Leslie of Wartle, and
Alexander Stewart of Loanhead, Esquires.  The medium
rent of the in-field is 20 s. Sterling per acre.  There is meal
paid for the out-fields, at the rate of from 2 s. to 8 s. or 9 s.
the acre.  Some of the small crofts are rented as high as 30 s.
per acre.

   Church, and School,.-The present stipend is 42 L. Ster-
ling, 32 bolls of meal, and 16 bolls of bear; but a process
of augmentation is in dependence.  The manse was built in
1751 for 1000 L. Scotch.  The school-house was lately built
