			  PARISH OF RICCARTON.

		PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

	Etymology.--RICCARTON, formerly Richardtown, was so called,

generally believed to have been uncle of the celebrated Sir Wil,-

forms a part of the middle of the three grand divisions of the
county. The village of Riccarton is distant from the cross of Kil.-
