   Antiquities.-In the southern part of the parish of Guthrie,
there are upwards of 15 acres of moor, which are part of a
Roman camp.  The rest of it is in the parish of Inverarity.
The vallum and fossa are yet very distinct, and of a con-
siderable height and depth.  The castle of Guthrie, supposed
to have been built by Sir Alexander Guthrie, who was slain
at Floudon, is a strong building, and is still entire.  The walls
are about 60 feet high, and 10 feet thick.  It has a prodigi-
ous massive iron door.  This castle and its door are at once
a monument of the ancient grandeur of the family of Guthrie,
and of the rudeness and barbarity of those times, when men
could not live secure, but in such strong towers.  The gar-
den of Guthrie is a mixture of ancient and modern taste; it
has several beautiful box hedges cut in various figures, and in
perfect preservation, though very ancient.  Some suppose the
garden to be nearly as old as the castle.
