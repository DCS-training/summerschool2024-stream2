little of the ground being enclosed, it is much destroyed
by the cattle in the winter, when they are allowed to
go at large.  The want of proper enclosures, with plan-
tations, is a great hindrance to the improvement of the
country.  Also they lie at a good distance from lime,
but not indeed at so great a distance, as that the roads
are very bad.  They are about 6 or 7 miles from the
lime-works of Torphichen or Bathgate, and about the
same distance from those of Cumbernauld.  Another
great obstacle to the regular improvement of the parish
is, that a great number of the proprietors occupy their
own lands; and though they and their families live very
comfortably and independently upon the produce, yet
they cannot spare any money to lay out in improve-
ments.  However, there are some of them who are both
planting and enclosing more of their ground, and making
their roads a great deal better.  They have, especially
of late, made a road through a moss, called Moss Candle,
more than a mile in length, between this and Falkirk,
which makes the communication much more easy; and
the proposed road between Edinburgh and Glasgow, by
Bathgate and Airdrie, it is expected, will be of consi-
derable service to this part of the country.
