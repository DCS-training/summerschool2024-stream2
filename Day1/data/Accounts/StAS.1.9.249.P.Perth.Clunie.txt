farm is inclosed and divided into 4 parts, nearly equal;
and the history of 1-4th explains the history of the whole.
First year, summer fallow, if the ground be foul; or, if
clean, pease, potatoes, and turnip.  Second year, all the
dung of the farm, with barley and grass-seeds.  Third
year, grass.  Fourth year, oats.  Then recommence.  By
adhering to this plan, the oats have already yielded the
12th, and the barley the 16th return; and as no two white
crops immediately succeed one another, the ground can ne-
ver be exhausted.-In the higher parts of the parish, the
old Scots plough is still used, with 4 horses a-breast, and
the driver going backwards between the 2 middle horses.
In the lower and smoother grounds, the low-country
plough, with the cast-iron mould board, is becoming fa-
shionable, drawn by 2 horses without a driver.  About 30
years ago, it was not uncommon here to see 8 or 10 oxen,
and 2 horses, all yoked to one plough; but there is at pre-
sent no cattle-plough in the parish.  The horses are of a
middle size; and the single horse carts are found by expe-
rience to be preferable to the double ones.  The cattle, ex-
cepting a few of a larger size that are fed in gentlemens in-
closures, are the small black Scots cattle, weighing from 16
to 24 stone.  A good many of these are sold every year
from the parish; but neither the cattle nor sheep trade are
carried on to any extent.  There are in the parish about
1018 sheep, and of these a few are of the Cheviot breed.
The number of the cattle amounts nearly to 1200; but
some of the smaller farms appear to be rather overstocked.
There are in all about 337 horses; and attention begins to
be paid to the improving of the breed of both the sheep,
horses and cattle.  The number of ploughs is 79, of which
the greater part are the old Scotch ploughs, and the num-
