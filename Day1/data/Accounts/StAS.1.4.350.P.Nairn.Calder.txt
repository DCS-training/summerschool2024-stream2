very high; are covered with heath, and abound with moss.
There is a good deal of hilly and rocky ground in the lower
parts.  A part of the low lands has sometimes been laid
under water, by the overflowing of the burn of Calder,
and the water of Nairn.  The most considerable inunda-

banks on the east side, covered with trees of all kinds, and

river of Nairn wash it below.  Both these rivers abound

deaths, 14; of marriages, about 9.  There are about 20
persons between 70 and 100 years of age.  The number of
