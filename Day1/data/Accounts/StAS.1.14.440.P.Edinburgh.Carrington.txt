ous advantages to be derived from the use of single carts,
has not been able to vanguish the inveterate prejudice
against them, and in favour of double carts.  On a very
large proportion of the parish, very inconsiderable progress
has been made in the improvements, of which it is suf-
ceptible.  Not a small part of it is still unenclosed, and its
general appearance is rather bleak and unsheltered.

   Number, and Employment of the Inhabitants.-The ave-
rage of births recorded from 1752 to 1762, was 16, 5;
from 1762 to 1772, 12, 5; from 1772 to 1782, 11, 5; from
1782 to 1792, 9, 6:  From which it appears, that as there
are no manufactories in the parish, to encourage the influx
of inhabitants from other quarters, the population must be
in a state of gradual decrease.  Hence, the number re-
turned to Dr. Webster in 1755, which amounted to 555,
was, in July 1793, reduced to 329 souls of both sexes,
and of all ages and descriptions.  The chief cause of this 
diminution has been the laving down to grass a consider-
able part of the lands in consequence of which many
of the farm houses and cottages have fallen into decay.
If it were duly considered that the soil derives its value en-
tirely from the number of inhabitants, and the consequent
demand for its produce, this mode if management would
probably be adopted with more caution, even by those to
whom profit is the ultimate object.  The number of fa-
milies in the parish is 85:  of females, 171; of males,
158; and of children below 10 years of age, 66.  There 
are 42 Seceders in the parish, including the children of 
those who are of that persuasion.  All the rest of the in-
habitants attend the Established Church.  There are in 
the parish 9 farmers, 1 smith, 1 wright, 2 weavers, 3 tai-
lors, 1 shoemaker, 1 gardener, and 1 small innkeeper.
