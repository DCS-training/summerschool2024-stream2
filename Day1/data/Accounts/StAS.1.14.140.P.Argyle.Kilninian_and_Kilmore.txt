are inhabited, and belong to this parish, together with a
cluster of small uninhabited islands, called the Isles of Treis-
nish.  Exclusive of all these islands, excepting Ulva and Go-
metra, this parish is computed to be 12 miles long, and 12
miles broad, surrounded on all sides by the sea, excepting
at the isthmus already mentioned, which, together with
Lochnankell, divides this from the parishes of Torasay
and Kilfinichin on the S.  To the W. of Kilninian are
the islands Tiree and Coll; the former at the distance of
about 6 or 7 leagues, the latter about 3 leagues from
land to land.  At a much greater distance to the N. are
seen the isles of Canna, Rum, Egg and Muck; and near-
er hand, is the point, or head land of Ardnamurchan, be-
ing the W. extremity of the main land of Scotland.  To
the E. the Sound of Mull divides this parish from that
of Morven.  In the county cess-books, the valued extent
of the parish of Kilninian amounts to 138 merks land, of
which only 65 have been surveyed, and found equal to
25,644 acres:  So that the whole parish cannot be much
below 55,000 acres of ground.

   Surface, Soil, and Agriculture.-The general appearance
of the land is hilly, and these hills are, for the most part,
covered with heath; but there are no mountains of re-
markable height.  What is called arable land, lies, for
the most part, near the shore.  The more inland parts are
tolerable good pasture, intermixed with a large propor-
tion of moss and barren heath.  The soil, in general, is
but barren, being a light reddish earth, or a mixture of
moss, with little depth, and much under water.  The
spots which deserve a more favourable description, are
in proportion, few and small.  The state of agriculture
is very backward, owing chiefly to the rugged face of the
ground, and forbidding nature of the climate.  Very few
