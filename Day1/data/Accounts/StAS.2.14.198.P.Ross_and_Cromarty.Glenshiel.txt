                 necessary capital and experience.  These apprehensions, which re-
                 tarded for some time the change of stock, have proved in part to
                 have been unfounded.  The success of the first experiments shew-
                 ed at once, that the climate and pasture were perfectly congenial to
                 the sheep.  The rearing of black cattle was by degrees abandon-
                 ed, and there is at present no farm in the parish except two small
                 lotted farms in Letterfearn, of which the staple commodities do not
                 consist of wool and mutton.  But though the change now describ-
                 ed produced an amazing increase of rent, the advance, in some
                 instances, of mountain pasture amounting to from 1000 to 6000
                 per cent. in the course of a single generation, the effect upon
                 the population was not so favourable.  The valuable and respect-
                 able class of " substantial tenants" has been entirely swept away;
                 such of their number as did not emigrate to America, having sunk
                 to the rank of lotters or cottars upon the large farms, are crowd-
                 ed along the sbores of the loch, dependent for subsistence upon the
                 laborious and uncertain pursuit of the herring fishing, or the still
                 more fatiguing, precarious, and pernicious practice of smuggling.
                 Nor has the ruin tbus brought upon the tenantry been unattend-
                 ed with a corresponding reaction upon the landlords.  Notwitb-
                 standing the incredibly rapid increase of the value of the lands, the
                 expectations of this class, and the additional expenditure to which
                 these led, rose in a progression still more rapid, and the result is ap-
                 parent in the fact, that the whole lands of the parish were lately
                 Under trust or assignation, in consequence of pecuniary incum-
                 brances.  Such of the descendants of the original occupants as were
                 possessed of sufficient means have become store-farmers on a large
                 scale, and, with the experience of a few years, have profited so
                 much by the example of such strangers from the south as have set-
                 tled among them, that they now manage their farms with a skill not
                 inferior to that of their instructors.
                    There is no village in the parish, unless the assemblages of houses
                 occupied by the class of lotters already mentioned, be considered as
                 such.
