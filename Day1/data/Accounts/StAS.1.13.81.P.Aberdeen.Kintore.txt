   The word Kintore is certainly Gaelic.  I am not ac-
quainted with that language, but am informed, that it
signifies "the head of the wood;" and it is certain, that in the
earliest times, there was a royal forest in this neighbour-

last century, being the first seat of the family of Kintore,
still called Hall-forest, remains in ruins indeed, but a ruin,
that shows it once to have been a fortified and strong place.
The forest is said to have extended from the west part of the
parish of Kintore, eastward to the church of Dyce, 5 or 6
English miles.  Dyce was in the earliest times, called the
"Chapel of St Fergus near Moss Feetach."  There is a
