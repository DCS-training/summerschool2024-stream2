remedy has been worse than the disease; the external air
being in great measure and the nourishing dews altogether
excluded by the thick coat of moss; and the perspiration
being greatly obstructed, the tree decays, and stickens, and
dies.  Trees of every description in the parish soon gather
moss.  Hence apple, pear, and other fruit-trees of the larger
kind do not thrive; and the fruit of such as arrive at matu-
rity is greatly inferior, both in richness and in flavour, to the
fruit on the Clyde.
   The women in this parish possess a singular dexterity in
rearing calves; and the richest veal in the Edinburgh mar-

   Population.-In 1755, the numbers were 559.  At the
beginning of this year, (1792) there were in the parish 788
souls.  Its population has greatly increased within these 20
years.  The increase, however, is owing not to the farming, but
to the manufacturing part of the community.  There are in
it three small, but thriving villages.  One of them, which, in
the year 1771, consisted only of 14 houses, and 63 inhabi-
tants, now contains 44 houses, and 196 inhabitants.  In this
village there are 36 looms; 12 employed in the cotton, and
the others in the linen manufacture.  The flourishing state
of these manufactures has contributed to enhance the price
of labour of every kind.  The day-labourer has raised his
wages one penny a day.  Taylors, within the course of last
twelvemonth, have raised their wages from 8 d. to 1 s. a day.
Mechanics have enhanced the price of their workmanship in
proportion.
