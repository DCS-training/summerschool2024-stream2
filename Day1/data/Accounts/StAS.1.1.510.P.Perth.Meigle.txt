of Cistercian Friars, A. D. 1164, and endowed it with a con-
siderable revenue.

   Population.-About a century ago, a considerable part of
this parish, viz the estates of Kinloch and Bamyle, belonged
to that of Cupar.  From a list then given in to the presby-
tery by the Bishop of Brechin, it appears, that, in Cupar,
there were 800 communicants, and 550 in Meigle.  Accor-
ding to the report transmitted to Dr Webster, A. D. 1739,
concerning the population of the latter, it contained 1000 in-
habitants:  But the report was not accurate; for, though its
numbers have been considerably diminished since that period,
it still contains 1148, including all ages and denominations.
There are 86 below 3 years; 165 from 3 to 10; 269, 10-
20; 188, 20-30; 145, 30-40; 97, 50-60; 43, 60-70;
20, 70-80; and 8 from 80 to 90.

   Rating the entire number at 1150, the proprtions of cer-
tain ages are nearly as follows, viz 1 1/3 below 3 years; 1/7 from
3 to 10; 1/4, 10-20; 1/6, 20-30; 1/8 30-40; 1/9, 40-50;
1 1/2, 50-60; 2 1/7 60-70; 1 1/7 70-80; and 1 1/4 from 80 to
90.

   In 1148 inhabitants, there are 37 unmarried persons of
both sexes who have houses; 163 married pairs; 42 of both
sexes in widowhood; and 242 families; so that the number
of widowed persons of both sexes is to that of married pairs
as 1 to 4 nearly.  There are born annually 37 95/100 children;
viz, 20 30/100 males, and 1 61/100 females:  So that 6 1/2 families
nearly, produce 1 child a year.  The proportion of the births
to that of the whole inhabitants is as 1 to 30 25/100.  There are
7 9/20 marriages annually.
