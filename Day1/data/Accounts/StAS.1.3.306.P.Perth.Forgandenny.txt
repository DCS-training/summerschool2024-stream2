fuel can be got at home, sufficient for a poor family during a
whole year.

   Rent.-The rent of the best arable ground is from 25 s. to
30 s. per acre, and of the best meadow ground 21 s.  Some
ground, however, is worth 40 s. per acre.  The rent of infe-
rior arable ground is from 20 s. to 10 s.

   Size of Farms.-Some farms consist of 200 acres, and o-

80 and 40 acres; and several mechanics and other rent

which serve in some measure to employ them, and to con-

farms is perhaps, upon the whole, diminished by the addition
of one small place to another.

   Ploughs, etc.-The plough used by the farmers, is the

chaises, and 210 carts, but no carriages of any other sort.

   Villages.-There are four villages in the parish, the New-
ton, Ardargie, the Path of Condie, and Forgan.  The New-
ton is situated between the houses of Newton and Rossie,
upon a rising ground, half a mile from the Earn.  It consists
of about 15 dwelling-houses.  Ardargie is a village in the
Ochills.  It is situated at the foot of a ridge of hills, and
upon a height up from the May.  It contains about 17 or 18
farm houses and cottages.  The Path of Condie lies in the
Ochills, towards the south extremity of the parish.  It is
