years, the population has very rapidly increased.  In a di-

dustry and population, the advancement of agriculture, and
the improvement of intercourse through all the adjacent
country, the termination of the war in 1783, and the reco-
very of the town and neighbourhood from the stock suffer-

causes, to which the increase of numbers, during the late
years, may, with the greatest probability, be ascribed.
