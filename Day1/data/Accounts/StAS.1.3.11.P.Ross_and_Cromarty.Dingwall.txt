an opening of the frame, a conical coarse wicker basket is
set, where the dung is carried.  In hilly and uneven places,
their lightness may be a reason for using them; but, in
places differently situated, blind attachment to inveterate cus-
toms can only account for the use of them.

   Rent of Land and Houses.-The annual land rent of the
parish is, I am informed, about L. 1200.  The rents of the
houses are difficult to ascertain.  It may not be improper,
however, to observe, that such houses as day-labourers and
servants occupy, are commonly let at from 15 s. to 21 s.

   Church, etc.-The living of this parish is L. 58, 32 bolls
of oat-meal, 9 stones Dutch weight to the boll; and 16
bolls of barley, country measure, which is considerably lar-
ger than the Linlithgow.  Eight bolls were the common
rent of the glebe, when it was let to a farmer.  It consists of
about eight Scots acres.  The present minister is a batchelor,
and has been settled in the parish upwards of 10 years.

had connected with it, by wide arches, one large chapel, and
several small ones, which were probably used both as ceme-
teries and places of devotion.  They have long been shut
out from the church, and used only as burying places.  The
heritors have it in contemplation to build a new church soon,
which will be both convenient for the parishioners, and or-
namental to the town.
   The heritors, including proprietors of burgage tenements,
amount to 39.  But, strictly speaking, there are only two, for
there are only separate valuations in the parish; viz. the
valuation of the estate of Tulloch, and the magistracy of
Dingwall.  Upwards of four-fifths of these proprietors live
