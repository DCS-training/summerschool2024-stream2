       And war and faction cease;

       is settled firm and just,
     May all the pillars of the fame
       Be faithful to their trust.

     
     That friendship fixes every mind
       Our actions shall display
     Because our Officers are kind,
       We shall with love obey.
     The en'mies of our freedom dear  
       We ever shall oppose;
     And we shall imitate with care
       The public zeal of ROSE*.
