above half a mile long, and about two furlongs and a half
broad, contains 94 acres, which are all under a natural oak
and fir wood.  3 dly, Inchmoan, i. e. the moss isle, lying a lit-
tle to the south of Inchconagan, about three quarters of a
mile long and a quarter broad, contains 99 acres, mostly of
moss, from which the village of Luss and the neighbourhood
are supplied with peats.  4thly, Inchlonaig, near a mile long,
and above a quarter of a mile broad, contains 145 acres, 66
of which are under a natural wood of old yews.  The whole
island has for many years been kept as a deer park by the fa-
mily of Luss.

   Phenomena.-Lochlomond has been long famed for three
wonders, viz. fish wihout fins, waves without wind, and a
floating island.  Vipers, which abound in the islands, and are
so far amphibious as to swim from one to another, are pro-
bably the fish without fins.  A man of undoubted veracity,
who lives in the village of Luss, affirms that he has seen one
of them attempt to get into a boat in which he was, and
that it was instantly killed.  A swelling wave without any
wind perceptible at the time, is not peculiar to this lake.  It
may be observed, wherever there is a great extent of water,
if a calm immediately succeeds a storm.  But independent of
any commotion in the atmosphere, at the time of the re-
markable earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755, the water of Loch-
lomond rose suddenly some feet above its former level, and
was otherwise uncommonly agitated; and some phenomena
of this kind, observed at a remote period, may have been the
wonder alluded to.  A small island lying near the west shore
of Inchconagan, is called the Floating Island.  It is now, at
least, fixed there; but that it may have once floated is cre-
dible.  In that case, it must probably have been a mossy frag-
ment, detached by the waves from the neighboring isle of
