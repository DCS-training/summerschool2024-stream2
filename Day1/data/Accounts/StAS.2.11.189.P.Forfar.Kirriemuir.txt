	In 1830, the collections for the poor were as follows: Church
collection, L.141, 5s. 11d.; mortcloth, L.22, 6s.; penalties,
L.18, 12s. 6d.; donations, L.15, 5s. 3d.; legacies, L.13; return-
ed, L.6, 1Os.; proceeds of effects of paupers, L.5, 7s. 8 1/2d. in-
terest on stock, L.2; in all, L.224, 7s. 3d. There is no other
regular mode of procuring funds for the poor besides that of church
collections. There has hitherto been a strong disposition among
the poor in general to refrain from seeking parochial relief, but I
regret to observe it is fast declining.
	Prison.--There is a lock-up place of considerable strength,
chiefly employed for confining vagrants till they are brought to
justice.
	Fairs.--There are two great annual fairs held on the hill of
Kirriemuir, the one in July, and the other in October, for, sheep,
cattle, and horses; there are two smaller ones held at the same
place, the one in June, and the other in December, for the same
purpose.
	Inns, &c.--There are in the parish 6 brewers, 1 maltman, 1
chandler, 1 tobacco-manufacturer, 52 dealers in tea, 48 in to-
bacco, 4 in vinegar, 21 in beer, 31 in spirits, and 7 in wine.  The
effects of the number of spirit-sellers on the morals of the people
are obvious.
	Fuel.--Tbe fuel commonly used is coals from Dundee, peats
from the mosses in the neighbourhood, and wood from Glammis,
Lindertis, and Kinnordy.

		      MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	This parish has so few advantages of situation all the luxu-
