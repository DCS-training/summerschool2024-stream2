ing goes on, not only this parish, but the rest of Mull
must buy labouring horses.  There are but few goats.
They are entirely banished from the Duke of Argyll's
property.  The ancient souming of the parish was 3068
head of black cattle, from 3 years old and upwards,
stirks and 2 year olds, not being reckoned soums.  The
number of sheep was the same with the black cattle.
There were near 1000 working horses, besides mares and
followers.  The souming now is less, and varies every
year.  Indeed the number of every kind is quite uncer-
tain.  Every gentleman farmer, at least, does more jus-
tice to his cattle than formerly, and stocks his farm ac-
cording to his own taste and conveniency.  There are at
present near 3000 Low country sheep in the parish, and
consequently the numbers of cows, horses, and Highland
sheep, have decreased in proportion.  Formerly no farm
was stocked wholly with one kind, but every farm had
a certain proportion of cows, horses, mares, sheep, and
goats; but now the farms are, in general, wholly stock-
ed with the kind that suits them best.
   The vegetable productions are oats, barley, and pota-

is called small oats.  The incumbent was the first, about
10 years ago, to sow great oats, but still very few sow
it, though it answers very well in good years.  The 
small oats is a very poor kind of grain, a boll of it hard-
ly yielding 4 stones of meal; but it is hardly, and the
grain being light, it is not apt to be shaken in bad years.
It is also better calculated to feed outlying cattle in win-
ter, than great oats.  A considerable quantity of barley is
raised, which is, in general, very good, except the barley
of Icolumkill, which yields but from 11 to 12 stones of 
meal the boll.  The principal food of the inhabitants is po-
