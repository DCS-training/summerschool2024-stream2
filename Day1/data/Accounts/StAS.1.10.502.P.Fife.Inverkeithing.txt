veral Kings of Scotland granted them charters at different
periods; and King James the VI. by a charter, dated 4th
May 1598, ratifies and confirms them all, and declares their
rights and privileges, to extend from the water of Dovan to
that of Leven, and as far north as Kinross.  It it is said to
have been a very considerable burgh, of large extent, populous,
and paid to government great taxes.  The set of this burgh
is uncommon in some things.  The provost, the two bailies,
the dean of guild, and treasurer, are annually elected by the
counsellors and deacons of the trades.  The counsellors are
chosen from among the burgess inhabitants, the guildry, and
even the members of the incorporated trades, who still retain
a vote in their respective incorporations.  The five incorpo-
rated trades elect their deacons yearly as their representa-
tives.  The town council, including the magistrates, cannot
be under 20; but it is not limited to any number above it;
so that the whole burgers inhabitants might be made counsel-
lors.  What is very singular, the counsellors continue in of-
fice during life and residence.  There is a good town-house,
built in the year 1770, containing, besides a prison, some con-
venient rooms for holding the bailie-courts, the meetings of
council, and public entertainments.  The yearly revenue a-
mounts to 200 L.  Sterling and upwards; many of their ex-
tensive rights and dues have been sold and disposed of at
different times.  The streets were once lighted with lamps
during the winter seasons; but this has been discontinued
for a long time.  The present magistrates are very attentive
and active in making improvements, and doing whatever is
in their power for the advantage and convenience of the in-
habitants.  There are several markets or fairs in the year
for horses, cattle; and different kind of goods, such as
coarse linens, checks shoes, etc.  This burgh is represented
