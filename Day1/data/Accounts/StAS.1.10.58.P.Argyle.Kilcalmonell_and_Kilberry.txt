performed by a missionary, paid by the committee of the
General Assembly for managing the royal bounty.  He re-
sides in the parish of S. Knapdale; but the greatest part of
the mission belongs to this parish.  There was a presbyterial
decreet passed, for building a church in the Kilberry division
of the parish, many years since, which, it is expected, will
soon take effect.  The language of the natives is Gaelic;
but some of them understand a little English.  The minister

each a small allowance.  Their situation is not rendered so
comfortable as it ought by the heritors or parishioners.  The
poverty of the people obliges them to employ the children in
farming and herding, which either prevents them entirely
from going to school, or makes their attendance too irregular
to receive much benefit therefrom.

doubted whether any parish in Scotland can produce so long
a lift of people, with so few instances of crimes*.

classes in this and in other parishes, and that which can be least
easily reconciled to the hardships of their situation, is their fond-
