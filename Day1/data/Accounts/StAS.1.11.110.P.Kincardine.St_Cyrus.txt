the weeding, the pulling, the watering, the spreading on and
taking off the grass; in short, of every thing, but dressing the
land, which the farmers, from whom they take it, do for them.
Yet, after all, they make a profit by it; otherwise, why would
they continue the same practice year after year? If the
farmer, however, were to cultivate the flax himself, which is
sometimes the case, he would doubtless make more profit by
it; but it may be a question, whether the high rent he receives
be not equivalent for it? The crop of flax is always removed
in sufficient time, to allow him to sow his land with wheat,
which is often done to advantage. - About a third part of

quality.

  Ploughgates and Produce. - There are 50 horse, and 18
oxen ploughgates in the parish, allowing 4 horses and 6 oxen
