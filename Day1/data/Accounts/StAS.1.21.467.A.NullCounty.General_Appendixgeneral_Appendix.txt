     Remarks concerning the formation of a NAVIGABLE
     CANAL, betwixt Perth and Lochern.

     June, 1793.

IT is proposed to open a communication, by water, through
the inland parts of Perthshire, for a tract of about 40 miles,
commencing at the town of Perth and firth of Tay, and ex-
tending westward by Crieff and Comrie to Lochern.  A ca-
nal of about 4 feet deep, and 8 feet broad, is supposed suffi-
cient for this purpose.  The course of it, in general, could
be directed through a level country; insomuch, that for a
space of 12 or 14 miles no lock would be necessary.  Still
the expence of such an undertaking must be considerable,
and might amount to about 30,000 l.
   Before expecting a matter of this magnitude to be patro-
nised, either by the heritors in the immediate vicinity of the
canal, or by the public at large, it is necessary to exhibit a
view of some of those advantages which would naturally re-
sult from the completion of it: with that design, what fol-
lows is submitted.
   That part of Perthshire called Strathern, through which
the canal would run, is a beautiful and fertile country, capa-
ble of great improvement.  It is surrounded with high lands
and glens, which are extremely populous.  The soil, in some
parts, is well adapted for raising grain, but, in general, pecu-
liarly fitted for raising green crops.  It is naturally a wooded
country, and well watered with rivers from the surrounding
hills and lakes.  All kinds of timber, particularly fir, larch,
oak and ash, grow to great perfection.  The people are so-
ber and industrious.
   Under these circumstances, it is certainly a matter of great
moment to open a communication, by means of good roads
