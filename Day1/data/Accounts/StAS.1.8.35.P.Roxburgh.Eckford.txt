     of Eckford.

stone of an ell square, bears an inscription, commemorative of
some rencounter the proprietor had, with those who had taken
violent possession of his estate, and were plowing his fields.
The inscription, so far as could be taken down on the spot, is
as follows, viz.

     Here Holy Hall boldly maintained his right,
     'Gainst Reef plain force armed with lawles might;
     For Tuenty Ploughs harnes'd in all their Grear,
     Could not his valient nobl Heart make Fear,
     But with his sword he cut the formost Soam,
     In two, Hence drove both Pleughs and
     Pleugh-Men home.  

   This perhaps may allude to what happened in the reign of
James I. of England, when uniformity of religion was pro-
jected for both kingdoms, and, the Common Prayer Book be-
ing intended to be introduced into Scotland, occasioned no
small disturbance for a considerable time.
   Character.-The people are in general economical, sober,
industrious, and contented with their situations in life; main-
rain society amongst themselves, and with their neighbours;
are hospitable to strangers who accidentally come amongst
them; and are endowed with a liberal spirit to relieve the di-
stresses, and alleviate the miseries of their fellow creatures
upon every emergency, according to their abilities.  The only
means of meliorating their condition, is by a prudent and per-
severing attention to what they can perform; and, if the pro-
jected canal, from Berwick up the river Tweed, and part of
Tiviot, take place, coals and lime, with foreign commodities,
will be obtained at an easier rate, and the produce of this
country exported conveniently; which would be a fortunate
circumstance, not only to this district, but to the whole coun-
ty.
