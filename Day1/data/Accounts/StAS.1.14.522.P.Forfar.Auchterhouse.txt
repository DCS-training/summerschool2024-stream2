they rested, viz. "To inflict a disease, is tempting Providence" The 
writer of this account exerted all his influence to inspire the people with
more just and national sentiments upon so very interesting a subject.
He argued with them in private, and recommended inoculation from the
pulpit.  He told them, that many of the most pious and popular clergy-
men had adopted the scheme in their own families; and that, from the
great success that attended it in every quarter of the globe, there was
good reason to conclude, that it was a scheme highly favoured by Pro-
vidence.  But all vain.  Their prejudices remained, and their children
continued to die.  In 1782, he had a child of his own inoculated; and
in the following year, by tha advice of an eminent surgeon in Dundee,
he performed the operation himself upon his second child; and, at the
same time, upon some other children in the village.  They all did well.
He continues the practice in his family; and has prevailed with some to
follow his example; that is, to inoculate their children without calling
in either physician or surgeon.  In short, it is believed, that by and bye
the scheme will be generally adopted, and, in consequence thereof, many
useful lives saved to the public.
