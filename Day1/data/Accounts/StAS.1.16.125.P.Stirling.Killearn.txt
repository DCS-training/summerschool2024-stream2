the shires of Perth, Stirling, and Dumbarton, who are hereto subscribing, on
the other part, in manner following: Whereas, of late years, several per-
sons within the bounds aforesaid have been very great sufferers through
stealing of their cattle, horses, and sheep; for preventing whereof the
saids James and John Grahams, with and under the conditions, provi-
sions, and for the causes after specified, hereby bind and oblige them,
conjunctly and severally, their heirs, executors, and successors, that the
said James Grahame shall keep the lands subscribed for, and annexed to
the respective subscriptions, skaithless of any loss, to be sustained by the
heritors, tenants, or inhabitants thereof, through the stealing and away
taking of their cattle, horses, or sheep, and that for the space of seven years
complete, from and after the term of Whitsunday next to come; and for
that effect, either to return the cattle so stolen from time to time, or other-
wayes, within 6 moneths after the theft committed, to make payment to the
persons from whom they were stolen, of their true value, to be ascertained
by the oaths of the owners, before any Judge-ordinary; providing al-
ways, that intimation be made to the said James Graham, at his house in
Correilet, or where he shall happen to reside for the time, of the num-
ber and marks of the cattle, sheep, or horse stolen, and that within 48
hours from the time that the proprietors thereof shall be able to prove
by hable witnesses, or their own or their herds oaths, that the cattle a-
missing were seen upon their usual pasture within the space of 48 hours
previous to the intimation, as said is; and declaring, that it shall be suf-
ficient if the heritors or tenants, be-south or be-east the town of Drymen,

in Drymen, of their losses in the before mentioned, to a person to be ap-
pointed by the said James Graham of Glengyle to attend theire for that
purpose, and in his absence to the said Archibald.  And further, it is
specially condescended to and agreed upon, that the said James Grahame
shall not be bound for restitution in cases of small pickereys; declaring,

ber of sheep above six, shall be constructed to be theft, and not pickerey.
And with regard to horses and cattle stolen within the bounds aforesaid,
and carried to the south, the said James Grahame obliges him, that he
shalls be as serviceable to the gentlemen subscribers in that case as he
possibly can; and if he cannot recover them, he submits himself to the
discretion of the heritors in whose ground the theft is committed, whe-
ther he shall be liable for their value or not.
   And it is hereby expressly provided and declared by both parties,
That in case of war within the country, that this present contract shall
thenceforth cease and become void; for the which causes, and on the
