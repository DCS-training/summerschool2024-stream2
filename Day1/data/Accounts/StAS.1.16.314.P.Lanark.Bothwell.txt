silk cloak and hat; the men appear in English cloth and a
hat.  Their appearance in public and at church is decent
and elegant; but this taste for shew and finery, is at once

   In general, the farmers are an industrious, sober, and
virtuous people; regular in their attendance upon public
worship; just, charitable, and humane; constantly engaged
in the culture of their fields, they are happily removed
from the arts of circumvention to acquire wealth; or those
of dissipation to obtain licentious pleasure.
   The first day of the new year is their only holiday,
which they spend in friendly visits and mutual congratu-
lations.  Curling is their chief amusement in winter.
Their weddings are celebrated with a decent cheerfulness.
After partaking of a plentiful entertainment, the evening
is spent in festive mirth and the social dance.

   Rivers.-The only river is the Clyde, which waters the
parish along the south side, in a gentle declivity, with beau-
tiful windings, and here and there shallows, for the space of
three or four miles.  It is stored with trout and salmon,
which are taken with the rod or net.  At the end of har-
vest, and sometimes in winter, it overflows the holms or
low grounds; but the experience they have had warns
them timely to remove the crop out of danger.
   The water of North Calder rises from the Black Loch
in the parish of Earl Monkland, and continues its course
westward for about 15 miles, till it falls into Clyde, at the
bridge above mentioned; and for 7 or 8 miles separates
the parish from the East and West Monklands.
