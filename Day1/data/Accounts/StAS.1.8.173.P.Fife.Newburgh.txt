which salmon bring in the London market.  The company at
Perth, which rents the bulk of salmon fishings in the Tay,
seldom exposes fish to sale in Scotland, except at Perth; but
continues to send them to London through the whole fishing
season.  When the weather is not uncommonly warm, or the
fish more than ordinarily abundant, they are sent up fresh.  For
conveying them, the company employs no fewer than 4, and
sometimes 5 smacks, of about 90 tons burden each, which are,

from a monopoly of salmon, should prevent the inhabitants of
three counties, from sharing in those delicacies, which Provi-
dence annually scatters in such abundance upon their shores.

hills, in that extensive ridge, which runs, with little interrup-
tion, from the neighbourhood of Stirling, to the N. E. ex-

places, arable.-That abrupt rock near to Newburgh, on the
S. E., which excites the surprise, and sometimes awakens the
terror of strangers, in passing along the road immediately un-
der it, belongs to the parish of Abdie.  In regard to woods,
it does not appear, that there have been any of great extent,
