rable age.  Some of the ashes too, are remarkable on account
of their size; and one oak, justly claims the appellation of the
"Monarch," of this wood, not in respect of its age, but on
account of the tallness and straightness of its trunk, and of the
regularity with which its boughs are extended on every side.
It is extremely probable, that this little forest had been at
first planted by the hand of some former proprietor; but far
beyond the reach of memory.  Most of the trees, which sur-
round the inclosures below the house, were planted by the
late Sir John Erskine, and as is supposed, some time before the
year 1720.  The east and west sides of the hill, immediately
above the house, were planted by Lord Alva, more than 20
years ago, to which very large additions have been made
every years by Mr Johnstone, since he became proprietor.
it is computed, that not less than 98 acres of this hill, are
planted with trees of various sorts; and that the policy, as it
is called, and the plantations around the house, extend to fifty
acres.  The road from the house to the church, which is
little less than a measured miles has a row of trees on every
side, which renders it a very pleasant and delightful walk.
It is worthy of observation, that the trees on this estate, have
this remarkable property of being exceedingly clean and pure,
in the skin or bark; and that few or none of those mossy ex-
crescencies, are to be found on the bodies of the trees here,
which are usually seen adhering to trees that grow in low
and swampy grounds; which is an evidence not only of a
dry and pure atmosphere, but also of the happy quality of
the soil for raising trees.  'Tis believed, that the same
observation will hold true with regard to the trees that
grow on the same range of hills, having the same expo-
sures and very probably, the soil nearly of the same qua-
lity; while at the same time, it is but fair to remark, that
