knotted at each end of the plug, to keep it from shifting;
one end of this cord comes out at the bung of the cask, and
the other through the middle of the fore-arm; and by the
simplest exertion of drawing the cord either outwards or
inwards, the water within may be made to flow, or be
stopped at pleasure.  The cask may be filled with a bucket,
and a long handle, made on purpose, by which means the
most valuable part of the dung, which is generally lost, may
be turned to great advantage; and by a particular contri-
vance, even drilled turnip may be watered with this simple
machine.  This year, 1796, when there was no appearance
of rain in the turnip feed-time, it was put in practice at
Castle-Huntly with great advantage; upon the iron plate
on the front of the transverse arm, a piece of thin wood was
fixed, so as to cover the holes entirely, except a space which
was left near each of the two extremities, to each of which
a flexible leather pipe, of about 18 inches long, was firmly
nailed, and to the other end, the nose of a common garden
watering-pan was fixed.  These two pipes were attached
to each other by a piece of small stick, so as to make them
move together, and, by a handle fixed to it, the man who
drove, and who walked behind, guided them upon the two
drills, one on each side of the horse.  This operation may
be repeated once or twice, according to the judgment of
the farmer.

   Red Clover and Rye-grass.-In such parks or inclosures
which are intended solely for pasture, white clover and
ribbed grass are commonly sown; and hay seeds, as they
are called, have also been sown for the same purpose:  But
the grass which makes a portion of the farm rotation, and
which is recommended to be sown upon a sixth part of the
clay grounds every year, is always understood to be red
clover and rye-grass.  From 16 to 25 pounds of red clo-
