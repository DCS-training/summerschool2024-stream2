act was therefore applied for, and obtained, to convert the
statute-labour into money.  The conversion is at the rate of
25 shillings sterling for each L. 100 Scots of valued rent.  In
the act, the several roads that were judged most necessary,
were described:  One by the shore from Girvan to Ballantrae,
and thence to the confines of the country, by Glenap.  This
one is already formed, and has lately received some improve-
ments; but there are still some arduous and difficult pulls in
it, which are hardly to be avoided.-The other from Gir-
van, by the village of Colmonell.  Upon the credit of the act

inclosures indeed; but now the farmers are all striving with
one another who shall have their grounds first inclosed.  In
some instances, the proprietor incloses the ground, and charges
the tenant six per cent. or upwards, of interest for the expence
he lays out.  Sometimes, however, the tenant himself is at
the expence; the proprietor being obliged to refund him the
value of the dykes at the expiration of the lease, if he then
