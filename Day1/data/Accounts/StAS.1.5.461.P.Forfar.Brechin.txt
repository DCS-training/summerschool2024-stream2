which is severely felt by the poor; but although a redress
of this grievance has been often talked of, nothing has as
yet been done in the business.

   Bridge, Antiquities, etc.-The bridge of Brechin is sup-
posed to be one of the most ancient stone bridges in Scot-
land, but there is no tradition when, or by whom, it was
built.-The monument in the church-yard is one of the
most remarkable pieces of antiquity, perhaps in Britain.
It is a circular pillar, hollow within, close by the steeple
of the church, and considerably higher; and, as tradi-
tion says, was built by the Picts.  It is undoubtedly a
piece of very ancient architecture.  The stair-cafe within
it is much decayed, and is now hardly passable, though,
within these few years, one could have ascended to the
top of it without danger.  The pillar is seen at a consider-
able distance from the E. and it is said to bend like a wil-
low in high winds, so as almost to touch the steeple.

   Commerce and Manufactures.-A considerable quantity
of oats and bear is exported by Messrs Gillies and Com-
pany, and meal is sometimes imported.  Most of the mer-
chants deal in the linen and yarn trade, of which great
quantities are bought and fold every market day.  This
trade gives employment to most of the women, in this and
the adjoining parishes, who all spin on the two-handed
wheel, and are well paid for their labour.  There was also
a cotton manufacture, which was lately given up, but is
expected to be resumed soon; and there is a bleachfield,
which gives employment to a number of people of both
sexes; besides strong ale and porter breweries, which fur-
nish the town and neighbourhood with excellent liquor.
The spirited exertions of Mr. Colin Gillies have been of
great benefit to the population and commerce of Brechin.
