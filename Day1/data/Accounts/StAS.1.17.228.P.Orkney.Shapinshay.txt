receives from these destructive animals, and the clumsy awk-
ward way in which it is cultivated, it would produce no sort
of crop whatever.  Oats and bear alternately, however, it
produces, as also pretty good potatoes, and formerly flax of a
tolerable quality, was raised on it.  To prepare the land for
these crops, which are of the utmost consequence to the in-
habitants, as they make the principal part of their food, far
too little attention is paid.  Unacquainted with the mode of
farming in a more favoured climate, the farmers are at no
pains to make the direction of the ridges answer to the nature
of the soil and the situation of the land; they never straight
nor raise them, nor water-furrow their ground, nor do they
ever think of plowing it till within two or three weeks of seed
time.  The whole winter's industry is thus in a great mea-
sure lost; the land loses the benefit which it might receive
from the frost and snow; and, as the labour is not properly
divided, but comes almost all on at one season, this cir-
cumstance obliges them to purchase more cattle, and main-
tain more servants than otherwise would be necessary.  The
plough which is in general used, is but ill calculated to obviate
the disadvantages that arise from unseasonable labouring.  It
has only one slender stilt, to which as slender a beam is fixed,
and has neither reest nor mould-board; the ploughman holds
it by this stilt, and directs it by a short batton held loose
in his hand for that purpose.  Defective as this instrument
must appear, it has been honoured by a comparison with the
plough described by Virgil and Columella, as used by the
Romans, to which it no doubt bears some resemblance, and
the parallel has been drawn between them with all the pa-
rade of pompous ignorance.  But if the form of the plough
be exceptionable, the mode of yoking the cattle is not less
so.  Instead of placing them in a line, or two and two toge-
ther, as is common in the south of Scotland, four of them,
