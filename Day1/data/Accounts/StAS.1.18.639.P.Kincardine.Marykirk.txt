   Conclusion.-In order to improve thin parish to the fullest
extent, it would be absolutely necessary to have it all regularly
inclosed, and drained, after the most approved English model.
To promote this, the tenants should have long leases; and in
letting the ground, care must be taken that the rent do not ex-
ceed its real value; and that neither proprietor nor tenant be
imposed upon in the terms of contract.  By planting a num-
ber of trees, of hard wood, along the inclosures, and allow-
ing, at the end of the lease, a certain number to belong to
the tenant, this would not only insure their preservation, but
be of the highest advantage to both.  Short leases, high rents,
and high wages to servants, will inevitably (whatever may be
said to the contrary), in a short time, bring ruin upon any
country, where the ground is level, the soil wet, and the sea-
sons not early.  Every tenant labouring under these disadvan-
tages, will endeavour by every mean in his power, to lessen the
number of servants and cattle that cultivate his fields; but what
is the consequence?  In the seed-time, he never accomplishes
his work in its proper season; and in hurrying it on, it is ge-
nerally never done in the way and manner in which it ought to
be done; and for the same reason, the harvest is later; and by
not engaging a sufficient number of reapers, it is protracted
far beyond the time in which it could and ought to have been
finished.  This is obviously one great cause of the present
late harvest: but to those who seriously turn their thoughts to
this important subject, it will appear, that other causes have
concurred to blast our expectations of a very plentiful harvest.

attempts of evil men.  The tale of woe, that would have ensued, is happily
removed; and we hope a watchful providence will remove it for ever.
