experienced in so short a time a more complete or more gratifying
change. The subdivision of the land, indeed, was completed by
that time, and the population located as at present; but the science
of husbandry, then, only in its infancy, has now been matured,-
the fences and the trees planted along them have grown up, and are
highly ornamental,-drains have rendered the land firm and pro-
ductive in places where they were then only beginning to take effect,
-the roads, which are mentioned in the last Account as, being
deep, miry, and almost impassable," are now of the very best de-
scription. To no class of individuals could the warm terms in
which the intelligence and general worth of the farmers of that day
are mentioned, be applied with greater justice than to those who
now occupy their places. Nor is there any where to be found a
more intelligent, moral, and well ordered peasantry than our own
agricultural population.
