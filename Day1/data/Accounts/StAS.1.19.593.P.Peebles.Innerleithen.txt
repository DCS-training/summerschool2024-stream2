the boundary of Stow on the east, forming the southern
side; and from Tweed-bank at Spittlehope Burn-foot to
Blakehope Scarr, the north-west; and thence to Tweed-
bank, below Thornylee, the north-east.  It contains, accor-
ding to Armstrong, who made a map of the county about
20 years ago, 22,270 acres, Scots measure.  What propor-
tion the arable land may bear to the whole surface is not
easily determined.  The land in tillage, communibus annis,
is considerably under 1000 acres, of all kinds of crops.  The
general appearance of the parish is broken, rugged, and
precipitous, rising from the brink of Tweed, and the course
of the Leithen, to near 1000 feet, without, in some places,
leaving space sufficient for the breadth of a road, unless as-
sisted by art, which has been but sparingly bestowed to
that purpose.  Though, to a stranger passing along the
highway from Peebles to Kelfo, nothing seems to strike his
eye but stones or rock, yet there the indefatigable sheep
find a variety of succulent plants, of which the apparent
more abundant pasture of the northern exposure seems to
be deprived.  The parish gradually rises from Tweed to
its northern point, where it meets with the contiguous pa-
rishes of Eddleston and Temple, which bound it on the
north; Eddleston and Peebles on the west; Heriot and
Stow on the north-east.  Tweed forms the southern boun-
dary, and separates Innerleithen from Traquair.  Windle-
straw Law is the highest ground in the parish, and is in the di-
rection of the north-east side.  Near this mountain, the coun-
ties of Edinburgh, Peebles, and Selkirk meet.  The whole
exposure of the parish being chiefly southward, is productive
of fine grass.  The sheep-walks, though high and elevated,
are, from this circumstance, much valued by the farmer as
sure spring ground; at which season, from the inconstancy
and severity of the weather, the animals, already reduced
