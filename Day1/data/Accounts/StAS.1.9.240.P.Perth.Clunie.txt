it plentifully, (swallowing the stone along with the pulp,)
esteeming it a good pectoral, and useful in pulmonary and
asthmatic complaints.  The park of Laighwood produces
also the viburnum opulus, or water elder, the hawthorn,
the hipthorn, the wild rasp, and the bramble in varieties.
In some places the sweet-brier is found.  The park of
Laighwood was famous for hazel-nuts, superior in taste,
though not in size, to the Spanish nuts.  There also we find
the forest-crab in varieties; in some places it bears pretty
large and beautiful apples, nearly of the size of oslins:
Some of these plants appear to have sprung from the seed
of grafted apples, stolen from the garden or orchard by the
wild birds.  We have likewise the myrica; (gale), and
varieties of the falix or willow-tribe.-The larger indige-
nous trees of the district are the alder, along the wet
grounds; the bark of it is useful in dying purple; and
were this wood thinned in proper time, and permit-
ted to grow to a proper size, it would make beautiful
and durable flooring for rooms, being previously sawed out
to a due thickness, laid under moss-water for about six
weeks, and then dried in the shade.  We have also the
holly, so valuable in veneering; of the bark of which the
belt bird-lime is made: In the park of Laighwood it rises
in large copses, owing to its branches spreading along the
wet ground, and striking root at the joints.  These copses
form agreeable objects in the winter snow, and are very care-
fully preserved by the noble proprietor, the Duke of
Athole.  The birch is a native here, and also the narrow
leaved service, the ash, the plane, and the oak, of which last
the bark is so useful in the tanning of leather.  The oak
wood of this country is cut down once every 20 or 24
years, by the wood cutting companies, who purchase it,
