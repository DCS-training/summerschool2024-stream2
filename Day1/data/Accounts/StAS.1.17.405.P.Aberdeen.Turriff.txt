leases (of which the impoverished state of land at the begin-
ning and expiration of them is the natural consequence,)
the price of labour, and the distance from market, may be
assigned as the principal causes.  Under all, or a few of these
disadvantages, it must require the strictest economy, and the
greatest exertions of industry, in the tenant to succeed at all;
his improvements at first must be very circumscribed; and,
as every future essay must depend upon the success of the
preceding, their progress must be slow.
   For many years past the powers of lime in promoting ve-
getation has been known, and the quantity put upon land,
for that purpose, is annually increasing.  But, long after its
first introduction, the method of cropping land, after the ap-
plication of lime, retarded rather than promoted the melio-
ration of the soil.  For a field after being limed, by having
three or sometimes four crops of oats in succession, without
the assistance of dung, was necessarily reduced to a more im-
poverished state than before.  But experience soon taught
the imropriety of a practice, which no doubt arose from
considering lime not as a stimulus, but as a manure, and is now
adopted by those only of narrow circumstances, and whose
views reach no farther than a little present profit, or an in-
demnification for the price of the lime.
   The quantity usually given to an acre varies from 40 to
80 bolls of powdered lime*.  It is, perhaps, a fortunate cir-
cumstance, that lime has hitherto been applied to land so
sparinely; for 80 bolls, which is not more than what is ne-
cessary to have the desired effect when accompanied with a
proper rotation and interchange of green crops, would, by a
contrary management, render the land unfit for producing a
crop of any kind.  For some years past, the importation of
shell lime from England has been gaining ground; which
