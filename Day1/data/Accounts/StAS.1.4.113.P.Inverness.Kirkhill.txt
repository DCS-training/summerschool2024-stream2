There is a chalybeate spring in this parish at Achnagairn.
It was once much frequented, and thought to be very salu-
tary for complaints of the stomach:  But it has been quite
neglected for some time past.  The water, when taken up
at the mountain is quite clear, nor will its colour alter by ly-
ing; but if a little rum or tea is poured into it, in a few mi-

   Hills, Rivers, etc.-The hills that run along the S. E. of

constantly carried off for fuel.  There are some natural
woods of birch and alder, and some hundreds of acres of
planted fir.  Indeed, all the various trees planted for use or
ornament in Great Britain, have been successfully introdu-

along the N. W. boundary of the parish, for about 2 or 3
miles. It is navigable at high water, by ships of abot 50

Kilmorack.  It produces abundance of excellent salmon, and
several kinds of tronts.  The salmon fetch on the spot 3 d.

places.  A very small proportion is sold  in the country.
Herrings are taken in the frith, within this parish, in small
quantities by set ness:  Their season is from September to
February:  If any remain after that time, they are poor and
insipid.  If the people who fish them take more than serves
