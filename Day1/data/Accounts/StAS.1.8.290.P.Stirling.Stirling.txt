sary of all charity.  It is easier for them and for their treasure,
to admit persons to regular and stated pensions.  Stated pen-
sions, except to the blind, the lame or the diseased, are al-
ways productive of dependence.  They continue the demand
on the poor's fund; they increase the number of the poor.
This cause indeed is not peculiar to Stirling.  It operates in
every place where the administration is not in the hands of
the Session, who, from the frequency of their meetings, and

turn a wheel.  When necessity urges, they are incapable of
proficiency, and must either starve or beg.  There are, per-
haps, few places in Scotland, where the quantum of female
