  Cumming's Beidmen.-William Cumming of Auchray by deed
of mortification, 12th October 1693, conveyed money and lands for
the support of four poor, old, decayed or broken merchants, being
residenters within the town of Elgin, to the magistrates, and gave to
them and his heir the right of presenting alternately. The inte-
rest of the money and the rent of lands amount to L. 71, 18s. 9d.
which is equally divided among the four persons admitted to the
charity.
  Braco's Mortification 1729, of some lands to the town for the
support of a decayed burgess, produces about L. 23. The Earl of
Fife names to the charity.
  Petrie's Mortification, of lands for defraying the education of
six poor orphans or children within the parish of Elgin, is dated
1777, and is under the management of the kirk-session. Each of
the children receive L. 4 annually, and have the benefit of the bur-
sary for three years.
  Grey's (the founder of the hospital) Charity for reputed old
maids of the town of Elgin. This fund amounts to L. 2000, and
will receive an addition of L. 1000 more on the death of Mrs Grey,
the donor's widow, the annual interest of which is divided among
the daughters of respectable but decayed families. The two
clergymen and physicians of Elgin are the patrons.
  Laing's Mortification, of a park of land, to be applied towards
maintaining a decayed merchant, burgess, and guild brother, pro-
duces a rent of L. 5, 10s. per annum. The nearest relative of the
donor living in the county is patron.
  Elgin Savings Bank.-This bank commenced in 1815, and for
the first year and a-half the amount of deposits was only L. 212,
11s.10d. On the 3Oth May l8l8, it was L. 478,12s.2d. After
this it grew speedily into favour, for in 1820 the number of contri-
butors was 222, and the amount deposited L. 2087, 5s. 91/2d. In
1824, the contributors increased to 492, and the deposits to L.4851,
12s. 11 1/2d. From that year until 1832, there was a gradual de-
crease of deposits, averaging annually about L.150, which was pro-
bably owing in part to the rate of interest having been reduced.
Since 1832 the investments have exceeded the sums annually with-
drawn by L. 320 on an average.  At Whitsunday last the number
of depositors was 556, and the amount of depposits about equal to
what it war in 1824, and during the currency of the past half year
