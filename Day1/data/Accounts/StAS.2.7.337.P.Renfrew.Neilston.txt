Since these tables were framed., the only two returns which had
been delayed, have been handed in. The one is from a small, the
other a large printfield. From their being single, a pretty correct
idea may be formed of the immense capital sunk, the wages paid,
and the amount of rent and expenditure. In the one, the capital
sunk is not given, but the average wages weekly are :-to patter'n
drawers, L. 1, 15s.; to block-cutters, L. 1, 4s.; to printers, L. 1,

Is. - to tirers, 2s. 3d.; to labourers, 12s.;	to women, 6s.
The amount of wages paid monthly is about L. 160,     L. 1920  0 0 per annuj;i.
The rent paid yearly is                                   150 10 0
                                                      ___________
Paid per annum,                                       L. 2070  0 0

The amount of the other kinds of expenditure must be propor-
tionably large, yet this is amongst one of the smallest printfields
in the parish. The other, which is one of the largest, will give
an idea of the expenditure of those like itself.
After describing the kinds of work that is done there, the re-
port states that "500 hands" are employed in it.

That the capital employed in, erecting it was               L.112,000 0 0
That the yearly expenditure in carrying it nn is about'	20,000 0	0
And its rent about                                                500 0 0

          Sum total,                                         L.32,500 0 0
To the sunk capital of the bleachfielcls is to be added that of one whose return
bad not been made when the table was drawn up.
     Sunk capital, from I 4000 to L. 5W, average,             L. 4500 0 0
     Rent,                                                        250 0 0
