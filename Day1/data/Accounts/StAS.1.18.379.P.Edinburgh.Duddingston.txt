lished some essays which were admired in that age, as spe-
cimens of the remarkable purity of stile and facility of
diction, to which a foreigner could attain in the French
language.  His chief work was, "La Histoire des Troubles
,'de la Grande Bretagne depuis," &c; par J. M. de Sal-
"monet.  A Paris: The first edition without a date, pro-
bably 1672.  Mr David Malcolme was minister of Duding-
ston, prior to the 1741.  He had addicted himself to the
study of languages and antiquities, was received a member
of the London Antiquarian Society, and published essays
and letters, Edinburgh 1739.  These display a considerable
knowledge of the Celtic and Hebrew languages, and were
chiefly intended to form an introduction to his great but
unfinished undertaking of a Celtic Dictionary.  They are
commended by Mr Pinkerton, and quoted with respect by
Gebelin in his "Monde Primitif." and Bullet in his "Memoires
"Celtiques."  Pollock was successor of Malcome in the
benefices; but was soon removed to Aberdeen, as Professor
of Divinity.  Names higher in rank and fame than these
might also be recorded, to add some celebrity to Dudingston.
The celebrated John and Archibald, successive dukes of Ar-
gyle, passed much of their time, and it is said, received a
part of their education with their mother, who resided con-
stantly in this village, prior to the 1734.  The late Earl
of Abercorn made this his favourite residence; and formed
of it a kind of new creation: a Nobleman, whose character
was little known, or rather little understood; but who pos-
sessed singular vigour of mind, integrity of conduct, and
patriotic views.  The late Sir Alexander Dick was universal-
ly known, and esteemed for his general literature, public
spirit, and urbanity of manners.
