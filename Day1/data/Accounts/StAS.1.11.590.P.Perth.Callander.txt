although they have been no farther traced by the writer of
this sketch.
   In Scotland, the granite abounds on the W.; and the strata
of slate and lime-stone, which are found running in veins
through this granite, are generally blue, similar to the colour
of the rock, which at last surrounds them, unless they have
been formed from it.  On the E., the free-stone abounds,
with its seams of coal and lime-stone; and the veins of this
lime-stone are of a sandy gray, similar to the colour of the
free-stone, with which they are in contact.  These several
strata point westward as they go south*.

   Cascade.-In the glen betwixt Brackland and Achinlaich,
there is a bridge on the water of Kelty, consisting of 2 sticks,
covered with a few branches of trees and some turf, which is
abundantly romantic and dangerous.  The sticks are laid
across the chasm, with their ends resting on the rocks, which
project on opposite sides, about 50 feet high, above a deep pool:
On the one hand, the white cascade precipitates itself, from a
height above the bridge, with a tremenduous noise, occasioned
by the conflict of the rocks, the narrowness of the passage, and
the lofty column of water, whose spray often wets the clothes
of passengers.  On the other hand, the winding glen, which
deepens as it descends, the gloominess of the hanging rocks, of
the shading trees, and black pools, strikes with terror and with

force of habit, pass and repass with very little concern; al-

gether, but is firmly girt about by mighty bands; for all the principal moun-
tains of the world run in chains.
