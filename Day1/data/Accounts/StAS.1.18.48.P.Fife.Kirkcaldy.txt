parish, but tile parish church; if a mason-lodge be excepted,
which is employed for that purpose by an handful of indepen-

the dissenters, taking the whole number of souls, were 595
which was to the establishment nearly in the proportion of 1

presbytery of relief 51, independents 11, episcopals 10,
reformed presbytery 9, Bereans 2, baptist 1, Roman catho-
lic 1.

the exercise of mutual charity and of mutual esteem.  And in

dence one on the other.  The first master teaches Latin,
