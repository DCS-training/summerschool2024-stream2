     NUMBER XI.

     PARISH OF ABOYNE AND GLENTANAR,

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN,
     KINCARDINE).

     By a friend to Statistical Inquiries.

     Origin of the Name.

   The origin of the name of Aboyne is unknown.
of Glentanar is evidently derived from the rivulet
Tanar, and signifies the glen or hollow occasioned by that
rivuler.
   Glentanar and Inschmarnoch, at a remote period, made
one parish; but, from the poorness of the living, they were
disjoined, and Inschmarnoch was sunk in the united pa-
rishes of Glenmuick, Glengorn, and Tullich.  Glentanar
was united to Aboyne; but after the building of a centrical
church at Aboyne, the name of Glentanar was also sunk;
and the parish is now generally known by the name of
Aboyne.
