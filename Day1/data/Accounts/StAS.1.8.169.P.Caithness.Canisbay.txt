to their several homes; and he pledged himself, that he would
satisfy them all with respect to precedency, and prevent the
possibility of such disputes among them, at their future an-
niversary meetings.  They all acquiesced, and departed in
peace.  In due time, John de Groat, to fulfil his en-
gagement, built a room, distinct by itself, of an octogon
shape, with 8 doors and windows in it; and having placed in
the middle, a table of oak, of the same shape, when the next
anniversary meeting took place, he desired each of them to
enter at his own door, and to fit at the head of the table; he
taking himself the seat that was left unoccupied.  By this in-
genious contrivance, any dispute, in regard to rank, was prep-
vented, as they all found themselves on a footing of equality,
and their former harmony and good humour were restored.
That building was then named John O'Groat's house, and
though the house is totally gone, the place where it stood still
retains the name, and deserves to be remembered, as long as
good intentions, and good sense, are estimable in a country*.

Esq of Wester, above 50 years ago, by his father, who was then advanced in
life, and who had seen the letter wrote by James IV. in the possession of George
Groat of Warse.  The remains of the oak table have been seen by many now
living, who have inscribed their names on it.
