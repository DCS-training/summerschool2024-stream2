     Statistical Account

Danna lies the harbour of Lochnakille, an anchorage well
known to mariners. Between the lochs of Castle and Ca-
olisport is the centre promontory, or point of Knap; and
the point of Ardpatrick is formed by a bay to the north-
west, and the west loch of Tarbert to the south.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish.-This country was for-
merly a parsonage dependant upon the abbots of Kilwinning.
When, at the Reformation, that abbacy was converted in-
to a temporal lordship, a large triangle of Knapdale, adja-
cent to the mouth of West Lochtarbert, was annexed to
Kilcolmonel.  The remainder was erected into a parish,
consisting of fix several places of worship, among which
the parlor performed a sort of constant itineracy.  The
inconveniency of a charge so extensive, and so intersected
by arms of the sea, was equally felt by the minister and
people; and, upon application being made about 75 years 
ago, the parish of Knapdale was divided into the parishes
of South and North Knapdales, by a line of separation ori-
ginating at the shore, south of Castleswen, rising about a
mile due east, and running north along the mountains till
it terminates in the tract of the canal, a mile east of Loch-
Crinan.  By this partition, the whole point of Knap, and
glen of Caolisport, was included in South Knapdale; but,
though it had acquired nearly double the extent, the su-
periority of North Knapdale fitted it to supply the occa-
sions of a much greater population.

   Ancient Proprietors, etc.-Power alone, in the ruder
ages of society, constituted a right.  Not other title was ne-
cessary, either to its acquisition or maintenance.  The Mac-
millans were anciently proprietors of Kilhamacgand Knap.

wife, butchered her admirer, and was himself obliged to
