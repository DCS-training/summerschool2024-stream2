the western part of this same county; and the tenants be-
ing in straits for money at Martinmas, often sell the few
bolls they can dispose of, at 10 s.; they seldom get
more for it till Whitsunday, which is the time the price
generally rises.  Since the seasons have varied so much,
and turned so cold, they are at a great disadvantage for
want of grass; for the common leys and meadows that used
to yield grass, which might be cut down by scythes, now a-
days yield but a very scanty pasture for any cattle or sheep.
The average rent of farms was 16, 20, and 25 bolls,
the greater ones 30 and 35 bolls each, with a very few
exceptions of 40, 45, and 50 bolls.  But now several have
farms of 70, 80, 120, and 130 bolls, so that the number
of farmers is diminishing; which, together with the annual
emigration from the parish, is the reason that the popula-
tion has not increased for several years.  Several young
men and women go annually to service from this, espe-
cially to Cromarty, Inverness, Moray, and Aberdeen
shires, and some to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle, and 
some of the Colonies; some young men after, and some
before they have learned any handicraft.  Property in
land cannot be said to be often changing, except in a few
instances.  It is to be observed, that as there is an union
of farms, so is there of estates in this parish; 1 heritor pos-
sessing what 2, 3, and 4 possessed 30 or 40 years ago.  The 
last crop was generally the scantiest in quantity, and espe-
cially as to the quality of the barley since 1782; owing to
the cold summer and harvest.  So that, in one word, the
only means whereby the condition of the people could be
ameliorated, next to better seasons, would be, for the Le-
gislature to allow coals duty free.
