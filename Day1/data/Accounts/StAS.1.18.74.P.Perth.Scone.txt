crop, barley, grass, and lastly oats.  Others divide their
farms into five, instead of six parts:  The first part is, partly
fallow, and partly a green crop; the second is under wheat
and barley, with grass feeds; the third and fourth, are un-
der grass; and the fifth, under oats.  And then the rotation
begins again with fallow, or a green crop.
   The new plough, used here, is considered as an improve-
ment upon Small's.  It has an iron head for the sock, instead
of having the sock upon the sheath; and the mould-board,
which is cast iron, is convex instead of being concave.  The
Scotch plough also is still used.  Flax and potatoes are raised
in considerable quantities.  Cabbage and turnip also are
raised for feeding cattle; but chiefly for rearing young stock.
Every family almost now feeds a pig with potatoes and a lit-
tle corn; the bacon of which eats very well with their pota-
toes; but they have not yet learnt to use turnip for culinary
purposes.
   There are 2 farms about 400 acres, 4 above 200, 6 between
100 and 200, a much greater number from 60 to 100, and a
still greater number of pendicles*; some of which are rented
by mechanics, who, besides attending to their ground, follow
also their proper occupations.  The small farmers or pendi-
clers sell little or none of their corn.  Their wives, daughters
and maid-servants spin the flax raised on the farm; and the
money which the yarn brings, pays the rent.  It is surprising
how some of these small tenants, possessing only about 12 or 14

*Pendicles are small portions of land, which do not enable the occupier to
keep horses sufficient for its cultivation, for which he either depends on the
assistance of the farmers in the vicinity, or on the help of his neighbours who
are in the same situation giving them the same assistance in his turn.  He
seldom keeps more than one horse, and one or perhaps two cows.
