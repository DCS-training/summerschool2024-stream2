hills with grear care; as also with the foot, to press down 
the run of moles, so far as it can be discerned, as it very
apt to draw off the water in an improper direction.  The 
process commences with the drawing of water-surrows. 
First, one broad and deep surrow is drawn in the crown,
and from end to end of the head-ridge, on the highest side
of the field.  This is to server as a channel for the whole 
water you intend to make use of; and must be enlarged to 
a sufficient capacity with the spade, it it cannot be done 
with the plough.  If the ridges be level, another surrow is 
drawn parallel to the first, of equal lenght to it, and a-
bout 8 or 10 yards distant from it; and surrows in this 
manner are drawn down through the whole field.  The 
more the ground slopes, the more numerous these surrows
must be; and care must always be taken, that the forward
turned up by the plough.  be thrown upon the lower side.
   The water is then brought in at the highest corner of
the field, and allowed to run in the channel or great fur-
row, for the breadth of 4, 5, or perhaps 6 ridges, ac-
cording to the quantity of the stream.  It is then dammed 
up, when upon a small opening being made in the lower 
side of the furrow, opposite to the crown of each ridge
it pours itself in an equal manner into the field be-
low.  It is soon intercepted by the next surrow, which 
serves not only as a channel for it, but as a dam-dike to 
make it spread itself over a considerable part of the ground 
immediately above:  When it begins to overflow, let small 
apertures be made in the surrow opposite to those men-
tioned before, and for the same purpose.  In this manner 
is it sent from surrow to surrow, till it reaches the lowest 
side of the field.  When the first 5 or 6 ridges are done suffi-
ciently, (that is, when they are saturated with the water,
which may be known by the soft swelling of the ground,
