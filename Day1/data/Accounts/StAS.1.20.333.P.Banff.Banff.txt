     of Banff.

   Ecclesiastical State.-From the public records it appears,
that the kirk of Banff was rebuilt by the town-council in 
the year 1471, when Sir James Ogilvie of Deskford was
provost.  They endowed a chaplain, with ten merks of 
stipend, besides a living out of the common fund.  Before
this period, the chaplainry of St Mary, of the order of Car-
melities, was the only other establishedment of worship in the
royalty.
   The parishes of Banff and Inverboindie continued united
till the year 1634, when Mr Alxander Seaton, then mini-
ster of Banff, brought and action* of valuation and modifica-
tion of the teinds against the heritors, by which the union
was declared void, and each holden to be a separate parish,
and distinct congregation.
   The first minister of this parish, after its disjunction from
Boindie, was Mr Alxander Seaton.  He died 1679, and was
succeeded by Mr Patrick Innes, minister of Deskford, who
died anno 1699.  His successor in office was Mr William
Hunter, minister of Tyrie.  In 1712, Mr Hunter being su-
spended from preaching, upon his refusal of the abjuration
oath, the church was supplied by the brethren of the neigh-
bourhood.  The following year he returned to his charge,
and died 1716.  Mr James Innes was admitted in Decem-
ber 1716, and died September 1753.  In December fol-
lowing, Mr Robert Trail, minister at Kettins, was admit-
ted; and in October 1716, was preferred to the Divinity

*The Earl of Airly, Lord Deskfork, and the other heritors, unanimous-
ly submitted the terms of the disjunction, and amount of stipend, to Patrick
Archbishop of Glasgow, and John Bishop of Ross.  Accordingly, these ar-
biters settled the boundaries of the two parishes, and fixed the quantum of
stipend payable to each minister, at 3 1/2 chalders of visual, and 350 merks
of money, with the vicarage teinds ipsa corpora.  This judgement was con-
firmed by the Lords Commissioners of Teinds.
