years; with the solitary exception, of their being invited to
the superintendence of a more extensive and lucrative semi-
nary.  Nothing has afforded a more general subject of com-
plaint, than the frequent and sudden resignation of school-
masters: nor with more justice; as nothing more effectually
impedes the progress of the scholars, who generally require
some time to accommodate themselves to the new disposi-
tions, habits, and modes of teaching, of each succeeding pre-

   These two preparatory steps being taken, the way is effectually
paved for the accomplishment of the grand object; which, in my

and demand the exertions, of every friend to virtue and to man.
In addition to the common course at school, or rather, in addi-

them to assume.  Arithmetic, the best praxis of reason, and
the noblest field for the evolution of ingenuity and reflection,
is commonly taught in the same manner as a mechanic is
taught to handle his tools: and a few dogmas of speculative
school-divinity, are substituted in place of familiar explana-
tions of Christian duties, and engaging illustrations of them
