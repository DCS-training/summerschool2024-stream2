ing, although a great deal of the ground is fit for nothing
else.  Some plantations that were made about 40 years ago,
being chiefly of Scotch fir, are not in a very thriving con-

   River, Sea-coast, etc.-The river Dee is not navigable
here, but produces excellent salmon. The different pro-
prietors upon the river let their fishings; but as the fish are
not got in great quantity at this distance from the mouth,
they fetch but small rents.  I suppose the gross rent of all
the salmon-fishings in the parish, would be found to be short
of L. 100 Sterling.  The river Dee, from its long course,
and the mountainous country through which it runs, is sub-
ject to very sudden and very high floods.  In the year
1768, one of these happened in the middle of harvest,
which swept the whole crop of the haughs, and also a great
many sheep from the inches, or small islands, which are
frequent in the midst of the river.  We had another swell
of the river, not much inferior to the former, in November
last, the water rose 9 1/2 or 10 feet above its usual level.
This swell was occasioned by a storm of wind and rain
from the S. E. and it is remarked here, that rain from the
E. always fills the river more than from any other quarter.
Luckily when this flood happened, the harvest was nearly
over.  The ravages which it made in overthrowing bul-
warks and fences, tearing up the cultivated land in some
places, and covering it with sand and stones in others, were
truly astonishing.-The sea-coast, which extends 3 or 3 1/2
miles from N. to S. is throughout high and rocky.  No
part of it affords a safe harbour for any vessel larger than
a fishing boat.  Of these we have a good many.  At Fin-
don, (which gives name to haddocks when split, and dried
