                            III.--POPULATION.

In 1755, the amount of population was, according to Dr Webster,     1180
   1792, By last Statistical Account, -     -     -     -     -     1230
   1801, By  Census under direction of Parliament,  -     -         1216
   1811,                     Do.                                    1225
   1821,                     Do.                                    1249
   1831,                     Do.                                    1221

     It would appear from the very large average of births registered
for the ten years previous to 1700, that the number of inhabitants
was then much greater than at present.  Acoording to well au-
thenticated testimony, corroborated by the numerous remains of
old houses, a similar statement is applicable to the middle of last
century, so that in all probability Dr Webster's report was far
too low.  The depopulation which afterwards began to take place,
must doubtless be attributed to the monopoly of farms, the num-
ber of cottagers being limited by the necessary purposes of hus-
bandry, and the removal of the inhabitants to towns or manufac-
turing districts.  Of late there has also been a considerable emi-
gration to America.  But, notwithstanding, the population has
remained nearly stationary for the last forty years, which has been
owing chiefly to the compensation arising from two farms having
been parcelled out among many small feuars.
     The yearly average of births* for the last seven years was 33;
of death, 23; of marriages, 11.  Number of inhabitants in villages,
138; in the country, 1083.  Number of resident families of inde-
pendent fortune, 1; of proprietors of land of the yearly value of
L.50 and upward, 11; of unmarried men (bachelors and widowers)
upwards of fifty years of age 33; of unmarried women upwards
of forty-five, 72; of families, 227; of children at average in
each family, 5; of persons insane, 1; slightly fatuous, 3; blind,
2.  The number of persons employed in agriculture as occupiers
or labourers is 169; in manufactures, retail trade, and handicraft,
52; of professional and other educated men, 5; of labourers not
agricultural, 71.
     It may be remarked that the shepherd's plaid is a standing article
of dress; but the wide blue bonnets and coarse homespun coats of
former times are no longer to be seen.

<FOOTNOTE>The number of births, as stated above, is somewhat greater than the average in
the parochial registers, as a few annually are not recorded.  The number of deaths
is the result of the most accurate estimate that can be made.
