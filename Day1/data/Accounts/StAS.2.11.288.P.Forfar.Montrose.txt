are admitted gratis, and some from the neighbouring parishes at the
reduced rate of L. 12 a-year.
	There is a Society in the town for the relief of the destitute
sick, supported by subscriptions and donations; the expenditurd of
which, in 1834, was L. 123, 14s. There is also a Society for the re-
lief of indigent females.
        Friendly Societies.-Previous to the act passed a few years ago re-
lative to Friendly Societies, there was a considerable number of these
institutions in this place. The greater part of them, alarmed by
the difficulties they apprehended in conforming to the enactments
of that statute, have since been dissolved. Material injury has thus
been done to many who trusted that in their declining years they,
with the aid to which they were entitled from that source, would
have been enabled to avert the necessity of applying for parochial
relief. The small dividends received by the members will soon be
exhausted, and there is reason to fear an increase of pauperism even
more rapid than hitherto.
        Savinq Banks.-A Savings Bank was established here in April
1815, and has been continued ever since; and although it has been
very useful to many, yet it has not proved sufficiently beneficial to
that class it was intended to serve, nor do they seem to appreciate it.
The depositors are chiefly female servants, and industrious trades-
men who are possessed of small sums under L. 1O; the deposits,
when they exceed that sum, being transferred to the other banks.
There are few who make weekly or monthly payments agreeably
to the intdnthon of such institutions. There are at present 318 de-
positors, and the amount belonging to them is L. 1307, which is
lodged with the Montrose branch of the National Bank of Scot-
land. There is also a Savings bank connected with one of the
spinning mills, for the accommodation of the labourers employed
in it.
        Poor Funds.-The ordinary income and expenditure of the
session for 1834 is as follows:-
