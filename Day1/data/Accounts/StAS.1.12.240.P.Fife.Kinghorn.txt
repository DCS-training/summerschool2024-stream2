as horse-hirers servants, have now generally turned their at-
tention to the loom, and bind themselves as apprentices to the
weaver.  Such are the effects of capital well employed! Such
are the effects of regular and well directed industry! But the
command of water for working machinery, is not the only
advantage which Kinghorn enjoys:  Besides the stream alrea-
dy mentioned, there are two other rivulets, one at each end
of the town, by means of which bleachfields might be formed,
and, it is to be hoped, will in a little time be formed, for far-
ther facilitating the operations of the manufacturer.
   As a beginning has now been fairly made; as a spirit of
industry and of enterprise has now been roused, by the exer-
tions of a few active individuals, it is to be hoped, that it
will continue to spread, and will soon begin to operate in o-
ther directions.  The cheapness of coal for fuel, and of lime
for building; its vicinity to the sea, and to the capital of this
part of the kingdom, might also have been mentioned among
the advantages which Kinghorn derives from its local situ-
ation.

   Landholders, Rent and Division of Land.-The number of
landed proprietos in this parish is 13; but by far the greater
part of them do not reside in it.  There is no map of the pa-
rish; by consequence, the number of acres which it contains
cannot be exactly ascertained.  But they amount to nearly
3030 arable, and 340 inarable.  The greatest part of the lat-
ter is hill-ground, either covered with furze, or planted with
trees.  Of the former, there are, at an average, 170 acres an-
nually employed in raising wheat, 397 in barley, 212 in pease
and beans, which are commonly sown in drills; 749 in oats,
148 in potatoes, 110 in turnip, 328 in hay, 836 in pasture,
and 100 lying in summer fallow.  The quantity of flax sown
is so inconsiderable, as not to be worth the mentioning.  A
