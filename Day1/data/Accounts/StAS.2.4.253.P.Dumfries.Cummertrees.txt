		V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

	Market--Town, &c.--The nearest market and post-town is the
borough of Annan, four miles distant from the parish church.
There are three villages, viz, Cummertrees, Queensberry or Pow-
foot, and Kelhead, near the lime-works. The means of communi-
cation enjoyed by the parish are excellent. The parish roads are
kept in good repair, and it is intersected by upwards of twelve miles
of turnpike roads.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The situation of the parish church since
the chapelry of Trailtrow was annexed to Cummertrees is inconve-
nient for the inhabitants in the northern boundaries of the parish,
being upwards of five miles distant from some of the houses in that
direction. The church was founded by Robert the Bruce. Be-
fore the Reformation, it was in the diocese of the Bishop of Glas-
gow. It has frequently been rebuilt and enlarged. At present it
contains accommodation for about 450 sitters, and is in a gnod state
of repair; but it is much too small to hold the number entitled by
act of Parliament to church accommodation.
	The manse was built about thirty years ago, but is very insuffi-
ciently finished, and is smaller than the ordinary style of manses of
the present day. The glebe is 24 Scotch acres in extent, and is
worth about L. 28 Sterling per annum. The amount of stipend,
including the Government allowance, of L.37, 1Os. 4 1/2d, is L.150,
with the usual allowance for communion elements. The whole free
teind of the parish at the time it was valued amounted only to six
chalders, that is, four of meal,and twoo of barley; but at tha time a
large portion of the parish was undivided common; and some have
