principal part of the crop consists of barley, or, what is called,
ware-bear*, pease, and beans.  Farther inland, oats and barley,
potatoes, turnips, kail, and sown grass, are also raised, more or
less on every possession; likewise small parcels of flax on some,
but no wheat.  The barley raised in this district is of three
different qualities; true barley, weighing from 19 to 20 ft.
the boll; common country bear, or big, weighing from
17 to 18 ft. and ware-bear, from 16 to 17 ft. all Amsterdam
weight, and Aberdeen measure.  The oats raised here are
good, especially on the coast, weighing, on well managed
farms, 16 ft.  Some brocked, but little, if any, small oats are
now raised.  Lime has been used here as manure, during the
course of 80 years, though, for a long time, very improperly;
its application now being better understood, it is attended with
good effects.-There are several veins of limestone in the
parish; one is of a superior quality to any in this corner of the
country: its produce is carried inland to a considerable dis-
tance for the purpose of building.  Sea ware, and, of late,
shell sand, are used as manure.-Servant's wages are in-
creased to about double what they were 30 years ago, and are
every year augmenting; as is the price of labour of every kind.
-The numbers of the cattle maintained in the parish,
in 1792, is as follows:
     Horses 463. Black cattle 1248. Sheep 602.

   Church, Poor, etc.-The parish church is the only place
where divine service is publicly performed in the parish.  Its
fabric, the minister's manse and offices, are all in good repair.
The minister's stipend is a chalder of ware-bear; another of

*When bear or big is manured with sea ware, the crop is very abundant,
but the grain is very small, and is known by the name of Ware bear.
