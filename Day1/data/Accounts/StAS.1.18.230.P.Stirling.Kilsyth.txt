them.  The last mentioned is rather regarded as noxious;
And the waters of it are said to have proved fatal to the un-
wary traveller: But this seems to be a vulgar prejudice.
The water appears pure and salubrious; but as it lies upon
the hilly road to Stirling, and near the very summit of the
hill, perhaps some traveller, in the servid noon of a sum-
mer's day, overheated with the fatigue of climbing, may
have rashly tasted or drunk liberally of the cooling spring.
This, at all events, must have been dangerous.  Perhaps, at

of a mile above the town, and near the old mansion-house of
Kilsyth.  It seems to be a strong chalybeate; and is said to
have been much resorted to in former times, and deemed
medicinal in certain nervous affections of the stomach It is
now so totally neglected, that it is not easy for a stranger to

analysis having been made of the water; but, as it tastes and
smells somewhat like rotten eggs, or the scourings of a foul
gun, as it makes silver black, and wood of a reddish yellow,
I am disposed to think it is impregnated with a considerable
quantity of sulphur.-In one of our lime quarries there are
evidently rome springs of a petrifying quality, but none of
any note.

   Minerals.-The mineralogy of the parish would fill a vo-
lume; and might engage the attention of the natural histori-

sciences I shall only give a general glance at the subject.
   The first article I shall mention, is the iron-stone.  In
both extremities, and near the centre of the parish, this has
been found; and there are favourable appearances in a varie-
