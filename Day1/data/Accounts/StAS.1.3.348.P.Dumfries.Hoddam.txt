land began to be manured with lime.  This manure being
washed from the land into the river by floods, is supposed to
be very fatal to every species of fish.  The Milk washes
only a small corner on the north-west of the parish, and then
empties itself into the Annan.  It runs from the east.  The
extent of its course is about 14 miles.  It abounds with small
fish, and is an excellent river for routing.  The Mien, which
is so small as hardly to deserve the name of a river, runs also
from the east.  The extent of its course is about 6 miles.  It
runs across the parish, dividing the old parish of Hoddom
from that of Line. and then empties itself into the Annan.
Tnis rivulet is continually changing its channel, and dama-
ging the land lying along its banks.

   Surface and Soil.-The land of the parish consits partly of
high, partly of low ground; and it may be added, that the
low ground contains a considerable extent of holm.  The soil
may be classed under three kinds:  Of, The holm land,
which lies by the banks of the Annan on the west, and by
those of the Mien, towards the east of the parish.  The land
near the banks of these rivers is all, excepting a few small
spots, a deep and a rich loam, collected by the rivers, and
oxce dingly fertile.  The next is that in the body of the pa-
rish, where there is a plain of about two square miles.  The
soil in that plain is light and gravelly, but pretty free from
stones; and, with proper culture, and a season not remark-
ably dry, produces rich crops both of corn and grass.  The
third is that towards the northern parts of the parish, where
the ground rises, from the palm in the body of the parish,
in a gradual and gentle ascent, finely exposed to the south
and south west.  The soil here inclines to clay; much of
it lies upon a cold till; some of it upon a rock; but,
when properly limed, is almost as productive as the low
