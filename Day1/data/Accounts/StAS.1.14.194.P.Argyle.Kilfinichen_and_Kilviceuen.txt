which wastes a deal of time.  The plough made use of
in the parish is probably the same that was used for cen-
turies back.  It is very uncouth, and drawn by 4 hor-
ses a-breast.  The reason probably was, that they knew
no better; for the incumbent, several years ago, got a
two-horse plough, and many are following the example.
The want of a proper plough-maker is a great loss.  At
present every one makes his own plough.  Captain Mac-
Lean of Kenlochaluine, a residing heritor, has got a Low
country ploughman, who holds the plough, and drives
the horses.  It is hardly possible, in most parts of the
parish, to carry on any regular system of farming, the
ground is so broken , and full of loose stones.  But a
great deal might be done, by turning the loose stones off
the ground, and rendering other parts accessible to the
plough, which now are not.  Many parts are soft and
mossy.  These parts are digged with Highland spades,
with great toil.  However, the crops these places yield,
seem, in some measure, to compensate the trouble.  The
mode of sowing barely in I, in dry seasons, and in sandy
soil, is pretty singular.  The barley is sown before the
ground is ploughed, and then they plough the ground
over it.  This prevents the grain being bared, by high
winds drifting the sand off it.  This mode was undoubt-
edly introduced by necessity, and answers very well.
   Potatoes are planted in the lazy-bed way, dibbled and
drilled.  In winter, as much sea-ware as can be collect-
ed upon beeches and in creeks, is laid upon ground for-
merly in tillage, or upon moss.  This ground is made
into ridges, and the sea-ware covered from the furrows
by earth, or moss.  Here, in spring, potatoes are dibbled, 
which are dry and wholesome.  The sea-ware cut or
gathered upon the shores in spring, is laid upon the
