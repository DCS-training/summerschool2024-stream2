three gallons a day of the salutiferous stream, besides a rea-
sonable portion of sea-water.

   Roads and Bridges.-The post-road, as far as it extends
through this parish, is kept in excellent repair.  The roads
leading to the inland parts of the country, being less attend-
ed to, are not in such good order.  The proposed establish-
ment of turnpikes must contribute much to the general
improvement of this country.  If the line is adhered to, 
which is already marked out in the surveyor's plan, the
new road from Banff to Turreff, though not much shortened
in point of distance, will oft beguile the traveller of his
time, by the varied and beautiful scenery which will occu-
py his attention.
   The former fine bridge over the Doveran was swept a
way by a violent flood in 1768.  Another has since been
built, at the expence of Government, a little higher up the
river, where it is supposed to be less in danger from the rise
of the water.  It is a handsome structure, consisting of seven
arches*.

   Harbour and Shipping.-Of old, boats and trading vessels
lay within the river, extending along the banks where the 
bulwark now is.
   We learn from tradition, that the course of the Doveran,
near its influx, was considerably more eastward than at pre-
sent.  It is said to have emptied itself at the Craig of Down,
now Macduff.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As an instance of the accuracy of some modern travellers, a large
quarto journal, lately published, informs us, that in Banff there is a fine
brodge of nine arches over the river Dive.  The river is sometimes spelled
Doveran, and sometimes Deveron.  In the Gaelic language it signifies the
Black Water, and is so named towards its source in Aberdeenshire.
