is, nearly one-fourth part of the whole produce, after de-
ducting feed and multure; that therefore the lands are mo-
derately rented.  But this will not appear to be the case,
when we consider, 1st, The want of good and regular mar-

   Services.-The tenants of the residing heritors usually
assist for 2 days in carrying home on their horses the pro-
prietors peats, and this is almost the only service required
of them.  All services are the remains of the old feudal
system, and it is argued that they ought to be abolished, as
they impede improvements.  But such small services as
there are no bar to improvements; for the tenants of the
non-residing heritors, who pay no services, do not improve
their lands more than those tenants do who perform these
services.

shop held the property of about one half of the parish of
Sandwick, and a small property in the parish of Stromness;
so that, with the feu-duties payable to him from the other
proprietors, he received nearly one half of the rent of both
parishes.  These lands being now vested in the Crown, are
set in tack by the Exchequer to the Right Honourable
Lord Dundas of Aske, for a yearly tack-duty.  George
Graham, Bishop of Orkney, possessed, as private property,
nearly one third part of these parishes, which property is
now transferred to William Watt, Esq; These two great
proprietors, with two more heritors, of whom James Rid-

ceive among them about three-fourths of the rents; and
