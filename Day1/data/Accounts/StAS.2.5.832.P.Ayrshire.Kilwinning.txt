They pay two different rates and receive a proportionate allow-
ance. These rates are twopeace and threepence a-week. Those
who paid twopence for some time after the institution of the Socie-
ty, received 6s. weekly when confined to bed, 4s. when walking
about, but unable from sickness or infirmity to support themselves.
Such as paid threepence were allowed, in the one case, 9s. and
in the other, 6s. As it was found, however, that the income did
not meet the expenditure, the rates of aliment have since been re-
duced to 5s. and 3s. for the one rate of payment, and 7s. 6d. and
4s. per week for the other. The funds at present amount to near-
ly L.500.
	The Female Society which was instituted in 1817, had, in 1820,
70 members; in 1830, 80; in 1840, 120. That which was form-
ed in 1818, had, in 1820, 160 members; in i83O, 329; in 1840,
537. The remaining one, which was begun in 1820, had at first
160 members; in 1830, 346; and in 1840, 309. The rate of
payment to these associations is one penny per week. The allow-
ance granted to those connected with the first is 3s. when in bed,
and Is. 6d. when unable to work. It has scarcely any permanent
or sinking fund. The aliment given by the other two is 5s. when
the members are confined to bed, and 2s. 6d. when incapacitated
from following their usual vocations. They have considerable
funds, although, from the depressed state of trade, and other
causes, they are gradually diminishing.
	Savings Bank.--About two years ago, a Savings Bank was in-
stituted; but, as there is a branch of the Commercial Banking
Company's Bank in the town where small sums are received, it
has not hitherto done much business. The investments amounted
the first year to L.243, 12s. 3d., and there was drawn L.83, 17s.
6d. The second year, there was invested L.75, 12s. 4d.; drawn
L.44, 10s. The investments are generally made by tradesmen in
town, and, in some cases, by servants; frequently by those who,
many years ago, had made a little money, and comparatively sel-
dom by young people. The weaving part of the population, and
those residing in the country, seldom make any deposits,--the
latter from an idea that their money is not secure.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons
on the, poor roll during the last ten years, 97. The average, sum
allotted to each annualy is L.2s., 8d. There are also occasional
disbursement, which vary considerably in different years; but the
