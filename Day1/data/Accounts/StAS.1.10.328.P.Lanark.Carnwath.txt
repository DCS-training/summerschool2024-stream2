bullock or cow; but now there is not a tenant, who holds his
farm by a late lease, who does not feed from 5 to 10, and
some of them upwards of 20, black cattle every season, which
have hitherto turned to very good account, each yielding
from 2 L. to 3 L. 10 s. profit and sometimes more.  The land,
after the turnip crop, is sown down with barley, clover, and
rye grass; the grass is cut the year following, and pastur-
ed for the next four, and at second listing is subject to a
different rotation.
   In the muirland part of the parish the turnip farming has
not as yet been much tried; and, indeed, neither the soil nor
climate seem to be fitted for such a crop.  Neither the dale
nor muirland part of the parish has been much esteemed for
the production of pease.  There is in general plenty of straw,
but often very little grain.  When the land in the muirs is
properly cleaned, and sown down with clover and rye-grass
it seldom fails to produce an excellent crop of hay.
   In the mossy lands there is a peculiar mode of cultivation
observed.  When the moss is deep, and so soft as not to bear
the plough horses in winter, it is sometimes ploughed in the
drought of summer; burnt when so dry as to burn, the
ashes spread over the whole, and then sown down in the
spring, without any further cultivation, with barley and oats;
and in favourable seasons a very rich crop is produced.  Moss,
of this kind, repeatedly burnt, becomes thinner and thinner,
till it disappears almost or altogether, and leaves the clay,
that was once three or four feet down, on the surface.  Some
hundreds of acres have been converted in this manner from
moss to arable land; and it is probable, that in half a century
there will be but little roofs of this kind in the parish, in
comparison of what there is at present.  But there are other
extensive mosses in this district, commonly called flowes,
which it is not probable ever will, or ever can be, converted
