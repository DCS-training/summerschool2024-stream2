   Antiquities.-When monuments of antiquity are look-
ed for and found, in any part of our island,they are
either British and Druidical,or Roman, or Danish and

feudal times; and, perhaps, some peculiar to the bor-

on shortened, but reasonable leases, to promote a more special and effec-
tual melioration of the lands, in proportion to the greater number of
people collected upon them; and who, as knowledge, in the various
branches of agriculture increases, will always find sufficient employment,
and prove, that wherever the most abundant food and provision for man
and the serviceable animals is produced, there the most, or very remarkable
increase of the numbers of the people, will certainly take place.

span, and have, on their outside, some downward strokes of coarse mould-
ing.  The cavities, from which they were dislodged, were about 6 feet in
length, and their breadth nearly equal to that of an ordinary grave.  Their
