been exported, at 7 s. 9 d. per ton.  The remainder has been
disposed of in the coasting trade, and in the adjacent country.
A great many of the chew-coals, are carried by the contract
shipping to the London market, at 6 s per ton.  The greatest
part of the small coal is consumed by the fast-works, which
consist of 16 pans, and employ about 30 salters and labourers.
The annual quantity of salt made, may be about 37,000
bushels, which is partly disposed of in the coasting trade;
but chiefly, for the supply of the country to the south and
west of Borrowstownness.  It is sold at 3 s 6 d per bushel,
including duty.  But upon the duty, there is a draw-back of
7 d 1/2 per cent, allowed by the Custom-house to the purchaser.
It is believed, that the salt-works were erected here a conside-
table time before coal-pits were opened; and that in place of
coal, wood was applied as fuel.  Hence, small coal retains
the name of pan-wood.-The number of colliers, coal-bear-
ers, labourers, carters, etc. employed about the coalliery,
may be nearly 250.

   Ecclesiastical State, etc.-The present church of Borrow-
stownness, is a good plain edifice.  When the parishes were
first united* in the year 1669, the Duke of Hamilton added
a large aisle for himself and his tenants.  In this form, the
church continued till about 20 years ago, when, pursuant to
an agreement between the town and the Duke's Commis-
sioners, the aisle was taken down, and the church nearly re-
built.  The two front-corners were extended as far as the
aisle had gone; and the area within the walls, is now an ob-
long figure of 69 feet, by 48.  The walls and ceiling are

*It was formerly mentioned, that Bo-ness is an united parish.  A little

Kinniel, are still to be seen.
