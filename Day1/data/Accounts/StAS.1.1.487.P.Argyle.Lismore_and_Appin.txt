years, but never before; and they are now very numerous.
In Appin and Kingerloch, there are moles, weasels, white
rats, martins, pole cats, wild-cats, common and mountain
hare; the last as white as snow in winter.  There was not a
common hare in the valleys in Appin, or in the neighbour-

badgers, and otters, in Appin.  In the lower parts of Appin,
particularly on the Marquis of Tweedel's and Mr Campbell
of Aird's properties, there are roes in great abundance; not
the she of the hart, as some of our English Dictionaries false-

as the deer have their harts and hinds.  In the higher parts
of Appin, a few red or mountain deer frequently appear,
when they are scared or frightened from the neighbouring 
forest of Buachail*, etc.  A few deer occasionally appear in
Kingerloch; but the sheep will soon banish them, as they
cannot endure to pasture with them; nor are the roes fond
of it.  The squirrel is now become very rare, if not totally
extinct, in this part of the Highlands.

   The birds in this parish are much the same as in other
parts of the West Highlands.  Eagles abound in Kinger-
loch, and the higher parts of Appin, together with ptarmi-
gans, black cocks or heath-fowl, grouse or moor-fowl.  There 
are a few partridges in Lismore and Appin.  A variety of
hawks are found in Lismore, from the smallest kinds to the
falcon or hunting hawk.  Wild geese hatch in some of the
islands round Lismore.  Though the very existence of the
jackdaws with red feet and bills is denied by some of the in-
