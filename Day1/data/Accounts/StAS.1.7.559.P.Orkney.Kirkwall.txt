the tenants are yet rather in a poor condition.  Their leases
are very short, being only a year, three years, or at longest
seven years; and the abominable practice of exacting gras-
sums at every renewal is not quite abolished.  Neither is the
skill more blameable custom of demanding services from the
tenants quite abandoned.  In some places, they are required
to cast, and win, and lead peats; to plough some days in
spring, or shear a few in harvest; or to go with boats some
of their masters errands upon occasion.  But, to the credit of
the proprietors of lands these, and such like services, are
wearing much out of fashion; they are now exacted with
much less severity; they are more limited, and better de-
fined; and, with many, they are abolished altogether.  In-
closing of ground is with us yet in its infancy, and confined
to a few gentlemen; for the country people, who, from their
attachment to old customs, hate every thing new, have not
the least notion of its utility.

   Years 1782, etc.-In the year 1782 and 1783, the people
suffered a dreadful calamity.  Through the badness of the
seasons, combined with damaged seed, the crops not only
here, but in all these islands, failed so totally, that, had not
the Government humanely interposed in their favour, several
of our poor people would, in all probability, have perished with
hunger.  To save their lives till the supply from the Treasury
arrived, the kirk-session exerted themselves vigorously, by
purchasing for them pease, and other cheap food, from the
south country.  Much about the same time, or soon after,
the small-pox were introduced here, after being for some
length of time absent; and, in order to overcome the aver-
sion which some of the meaner sort of people still have to
inoculation, the kirk-session, on a motion made, agreed to
bear the expence of inoculating the children of such parents
