*It is proper to remark, that the population of this parish, like that of every
other of the kind, varies considerably in the summer and winter months.  Per-
haps the medium population may be 590.  From want of proper registers, and
also from the practice of burying in neighbouring church-yards, it was found
impossible to get a list of the births, deaths, and marriages, for any length of
time back.  By inquiring, however, at the different families during the diets
of examination last spring, it was found, that from 1st January 1792, to 1st Ja-
nuary 1793, there were 17 born, 16 died, and 12 married.
