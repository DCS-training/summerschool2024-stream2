through which they run.  They are but small, and mostly
clear and rapid, being formed chiefly of the streams that
fall into them from the adjacent hills.  There is another
small river, named Falloch, which runs through Glenfalloch,
and seems to give its name to that valley.  It discharges it-
self into the north end of Lochlomond.

   Fish.-Salmon and trout are the kinds of fish that abound
most in the lakes and rivers of this parish.  The salmon of
Loch-Tay are rich and large; and it is a remarkable circum-
stance respecting this lake, that, excepting for about two
months in the middle of winter, the salmon are found clean
therein during the whole year.  They go west the river Do-
chart in considerable numbers in the spring arid summer
months, but few or none of them are found in the Lochy;
owing probably to some considerable falls in that river.
There are some trout of a large size found in Loch-Tay, but
they are rare; and the trout in the rivers of Lochy and Do-
chart, and in some lakes in the adjacent hills, though pretty
numerous, are generally of a small size.  Loch-Tay, and the
rivers that fall into it, have also eels, pike, and perch in
them.  The char, too, are in the lake, but they ordinarily
keep by the depths, so that they are seldom got but in the
end of autumn and beginning of winter, when they proceed
up the rivers in great numbers to spawn*.

   Hills and Woods.-The parish of Killin abounds in high

*There is a circumstance not unworthy of notice, that the
Earl of Breadalbane has, by his charters, the privilege of fish-
ery for salmon upon Loch-Tay at all seasons, withont any re-
straint from, statutory restriction.  This privilege is said to have
been intended, for supplying with fish the nuns of a convent
upon the island at the east end of Loch-Tay, sounded, it is said,
by one of the Scottish Queens.
