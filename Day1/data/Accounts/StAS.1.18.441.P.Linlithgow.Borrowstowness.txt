fectly pure, except when the torrents rush impetuous from
the hills, after heavy rains.

   Minerals and Antiquities.-Besides coal already mention-
ed, iron stone is dug from a bank in the neighbourhood
of Borrowstownness, and is said to abound in other parts
of the parish.  Quarries of excellent granite and free-
stone, are also wrought on the south and west of the
town.  Lime-stone is to be found on the west end of the
parish.  A draw-kiln was erected about 20 years ago, and
the work carried on to a considerable extent; but the quanti-
ty and quality of the lime not answering expectation, it has
been discontinued.
   The Roman wall between Forth and Clyde, well known
in the History of Scotland, runs through the high grounds,
the whole length of the parish.  It is still distinctly visible on
the east bank of the Avon.  At Inver-avon the ruins of a
Roman tower still remain.  It has been built of common
free stone, and stands in a very conspicuous place.  It appears
from the foundations that the building must have been pretty
extensive; and were the rubbish cleared away, perhaps far-
ther information on the subject might be obtained for the
antiquarian.  In a window of the adjacent farm-house, there
is a stone with several hieroglyphic characters, which, al-
though much venerated for their antiquity, are not under-
stood.

   Prospects.-From the brow of the hill, behind the town of
Bo-ness, the ascent is gradual to the south, for more than a
mile and a half; and the prospect still varying and extending,
is inexpressibly grand and beautiful.  On the east, the horizon
is boundless, the prospect reaching the Pentland-hills, Ar-
thur's-seat, Edinburgh castle, and the German ocean.  On
