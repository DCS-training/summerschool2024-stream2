whose son sold it in 1795 for L.4750.   In 1797, it was again sold

now belongs to his descendant, Sir David Dundas.   Corstorpbine
Hill was originally feued by Mr John Dickie, and was by him sold
to David Johnston, brewer in Corstorphine, for L. 1300.  In 1791,
Mr Johnston sold this feu for L. 3500 to William Keith, Esq. ac-

  Parochial Registers.-It appears from the Presbytery records
that a register of discipline was regularly kept in the parish in
1598, but it was lost before 1692, for the records are fully enu-
merated in the parish register of that year.   The first entry in
the existing register of discipline is dated 4th January 1646.
This record is regularly continued from that date to May 1689,
with the exception of the period when the English army were in
the parish, from Ist September 1650 to the beginning of 1652,
and from 1658 to 1665, the time of the troubles for non-confor-
mity.  From May 1689, there are no entries till 5th May 1692,
after which date it is regularly kept until 1768, from which pe-
riod it contains few entries until 1794.   The register of baptisms
commences on 5th January 1634, and the register of marriages in
June 1665.   There is also a register of collections and distribu-
tions, which Commences in January 1646.   The only account of
this parish of which we are aware is a manuscript by Mr Wood,
author of the Histor of the Parish of Cramond, containing 70
folio pages, compiled towards the end of the last century, and
consisting, chiefly of genealogical notices of the principal families
who have resided in the parish.  It is in possession of the author's
family.*
   Antiquities.-At the time of the erection of the House of Go-
garburn in 1811, some Roman remains were discovered in dig-
ging for the foundation, and in a gravel-pit opened in the park to
the south of the house.   These remains were a Roman dagger or
sword, with parts of the scabbard belonging to it, a fibula or clasp,
used by the Romans for fixing belts, &c. and a gold ring, very thin
and hollow.  They are now deposited in the private museum of
Mrs Thomson, Forth Street, Edinburgh, the relict of the first pro-
prietor of Gogarburn.
