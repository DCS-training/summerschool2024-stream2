shirts, and which sells, unbleached, at about 6 d. or 7 d. per
yard; or into a still coarser kind, which is made into bags
for carrying grain, and which, being much closer woven,
sells at about 8 d. or 10 d. per yard.  A considerable quantity
of this cloth is sold yearly at different fairs in this neighbour-
hood; and a still greater proportion of linen yarn is spun,
and sent by land carriage, chiefly to Aberdeen, a distance of
35 miles.  The women will gain, by spinning, from 4 d. to 6 d.
a day.
   Fish, Kelp, etc.-The coast abounds in fish, particularly cod,
which are of an excellent kind (Rattray cod being very famous);
but for want of a proper landing place, they are not caught
in very great quantities here.  There is no fishing town in the
parish; but some of the crosters and artificers, on the estates of
Broadland and Haddo, fish in good weather, when they are not
otherwise employed.  Mr. Harvey of Broadland proposes to
make a proper landing place, but has not yet begun to put
his plan in execution.  Sea weed, or ware, is used as a ma-
nure; and a small quantity of kelp is manufactured here.
Rattray Head, in this parish, is a very dangerous rock.  It
is very low, and stretches a good way into the sea.  A great
number of vessels have been shipwrecked there.  In these
cases, the conduct of too many of the lower ranks, in this and
the neighbouring parishes, especially of those who are most
adjacent to Rattray Head, can by no means be justified; for
they pilfer and carry off from the wreck whatever they can
lay hold on, sometimes in a very barefaced manner.  The
erection of a light-house at Kinnaird's Head, about 7 miles
W. from Rattray Head, will probably render these wrecks
less frequent at the latter.  The last ship wrecked there was
the Delight of Burlington, a large vessel, laden with iron,
wood and tallow, in November or December 1790.
