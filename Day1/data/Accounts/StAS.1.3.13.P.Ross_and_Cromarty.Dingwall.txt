   Price of Provisions, Labour, etc.-The prices of provisions,
within these 30 years past have undergone a great alteration.
At the commencement of that period, mutton, pork, even
beef, etc. were fold in the lump, by the quarter, or the
whole carcase.  From 8 d. to 10 d. was the usual price of a
quarter of good mutton, 2 s. 6 d. of a quarter of pork, and
5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. of an exceeding good quarter of beef.  Now
the average price of all these kinds of meat is 3 d. per pound,
which is at least double their former value.  A good fat
goose was then fold at 10 d. a duck at 3 d. and a sowl at
2 1/2 d.  They now setch twice as much money.  Butter was
then bought at 6 s. a stone; it is now fold at from 12 s. to
14 s. common country made cheese at 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. at
most; now it is never under 5 s.  Barley and oat-meal were
commonly fold at that period for 8 s. or 10 s. a boll; they
have not for many years been under 16 s.  How much so-
ever these changes may evince the general increased prospe-

dividuals, whose livings are stationary at a certain allowance
in money.
   The wages of a common labourer are 6 d. a day, and
of masons and house-carpenters, from 1 s. to 1 s. 6 d.
Supposing a labourer to have constant employment the
whole year, he will earn L. 7: 16.  His wife, though
she should have the charge of a moderate family, will gain
by spinning, with tolerable diligence, 1 1/2 d. a day, which is
near L. 2 a year.  There is no room for children to exert in-
dustry, as there are no manufactures.  The whole earnings
of the family, therefore, making no allowance for sickness,
idle days, avocations, or any other exigences, cannot exceed
