particularly the extensive track called the Mains of Comlon-
gan, consisting of above 2000 acres, formerly kept for pas-
ture; and, secondly, to the lime quarries lately discovered
near Comlongan, which have given employment to many la-
bourers; for whose accommodation Lord Stormont has built
a small village upon the side of the military road, where a
garden and a little possession of land is inclosed and annexed
to each dwelling house.-The return to Dr Webster in 1755
was only 599 souls.

   Ecclesiastical State, etc.-The church is an ancient fabric,
perhaps now the most so of any in this part of the country;
it is a long building, remarkably narrow, and has a projecting
aile or wing joined to it, which was formerly the burial place
of the Murrays of Cockpool, and is now of the family of
Stormont.  The stipend is 76 L. Sterling yearly, and is paid
in money.  The glebe consists of 36 acres, a great part of
which was laid off to the minister at the division of a com-
mon where he had a servitude.  The manse is large and
commodious, and built of brick about sixty years ago.  The
Viscount of Stormout is patron.-The poor are not numer-
ous, and are supported from the weekly collections in the
church; where these prove deficient, a voluntary charitable
contribution is made by the inhabitants, as often as they are
called upon, and the supply received upon such occasions is
always so ample as to answer the immediate wants or neces-
sities of the poor, whether arising from dearth of provisions,
or other incidental causes.  There is a good school in the
parish, where children are taught Latin, writing, arithmetic,
book-keeping, navigation, and other branches of education;
and as some come from distant parts, they are boarded in
the schoolmaster's house, which is fitted up with suitable ac-
commodations.  The salary is only 100 merks Scots.
