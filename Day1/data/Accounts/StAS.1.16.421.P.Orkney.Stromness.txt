   Crops.-The crops are very unequal in produce.  In
the months of July and August the appearance is very pro-
mising, but the storms of wind in the month of Septem-
ber often injure the crop.  These gales are usually from
the W. and S. W. and sweeping over the Atlantic Ocean,
are collected, as it were in a narrow stream, by the moun-
tains of Hoy, and act with great violence.  The two most
violent storms at the harvest season, for 30 years past, were
in September 1765, and on the 14th August 1778.  The
sea-spray has been known to reach 12 miles distant from
the craggy western coast of these parishes, which makes the
sodder salt, and often hurtful to cattle.  The fear of these
storms may be said to hurt the crop every year, as it indu-
ces the farmers to cut down their crop before it is fully
ripe.  As their farms are small, and their circumstances
straitened, these considerations, joined to the recollection of
what injury their crops have formerly sustained, make
them eager to begin harvest; and if it be observed to them,
that they lose by this conduct, they answer, that a green
sheaf is better than a shaken sheaf.  It may be thought
that this might be remedied by sowing more early, and
consequently bringing on the harvest before the autumnal
and equinoctial gales come on; but the spring season sel-
dom admits of this.  In some places where the grounds are
dry, they do sow more early when the season admits of it;
but neither does this always succeed, because there often
happens such cold weather in May, as nips the crop, makes
it short and stinted, thin, and small in the ear.  The un-
certainty of the seasons hurts the crop, both as to quantity
and quality.  As the farms are small, the present necessity
