ty: Scots firs, planes, and birches, are in great abundance, and
equally thriving:  And the larix, the beech, the mountain-ash,
and several kinds of willow, though less frequent, are in great
perfection.-The woods are frequented by the birds and
quadrupeds, which are common through Scotland:  Snipes,
woodcocks, swallows, sea-gulls, and wild geese, are annual
visitants.  Wild ducks remain through year.-Little da-
mage has ever been done by wind, thunder-storms, or inunda-
tions.  In spring, 1782, both Tweed and Gala were swelled
higher, than they had been for 30 years before, yet did not mis-
chief worthy of being mentioned.

   Population.-From traditional accounts, as well as from
the vestiges and ruins of houses, the population, both of the
parish and of the village, must have been considerable about a
century ago; and the general opinion is, that it has diminish-
ed.  According to the return made to Dr Webster, in 1755,
the number of souls then amounted to 998.  Since 1770,
when the present incumbent was admitted, the population has
been on the increase.  By a list, taken at that time, the inhabi-
tants were between 870 and 880.  A second list, taken in
January, 1789, made their number 901; of whom, 412
were males, and 489 females; 352 were under 14 years of
age, and 20 were above 70.  By an accurate list, taken in
January 1791, their number was as follows:
