quantity of lime commonly allowed here to a Scotch acre is
from 60 to 80 measures, which costs 9 d. per measure at the
lime-kilns, each measure containing about 2 1/8 Winchester
bushels.

   The mode of cropping which is now pretty commonly
adopted, and seems to answer well, is to lay the lime upon
the land, when in pasture, a year before it is intended to be
ploughed; then take two crops of oats, a crop of potatoes or
turnips, and sow it with grass seeds, along with barley or
bear.  If the ground has been heathy, it ought to be fallow-
ed a year before any crop is sown upon it.  Though experi-
ence has shown this course of husbandry to be very advanta-
geous, yet many of the farmers still continue to take too
many crops of oats successively, to the great detriment of the
land, and, in the end, to their own hurt also.  The improve-
ment of husbandry, however, has, for some years past, been
very rapid, and continues to advance and become more ge-
neral.

   A light made Scotch plough is almost the only one used,
and is found to answer better than any other, the land being
somewhat stony.  Two horses are generally sufficient for the
draught, except when stiff ley ground is to be broken up;
in that care, three, and sometimes four, are necessary.  The
number of acres annually in crop, as nearly as can be ascer-
tained, is about 850; of which 575 are sown with oats, 42
with barley, 30 with bear, 24 with wheat, 30 with grey
pease, 4 with lint, 20 with turnips, 72 with potatoes, and 53
with rye-grass and clover.  The produce is considerably
more than sufficient to supply the inhabitants, and the sur-
plus is carried principally to Leadhills, Wanlockhead, and
Sanquhar.  There are 38 ploughs in this parish, which is
rather a greater number than common for the quantity of
land in culture; the reason is, that many keep a horse, or
