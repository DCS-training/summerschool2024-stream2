     NUMBER XXIX.

     PARISH OF AVOCH.

     (PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD AND COUNTY OF ROSS.)

     By the Rev. MR JAMES SMITH.

     Name, Situation, Extent, &c.

   IN old records, the name is written Avach or Auach.  It is
commonly pronounced Auch.  The most probable derivation
is from a Gaelic word, signifying a ford or shallow water.  For
the bay, opposite to the parish church, being more shallow,
the tide flows and recedes farther than in any other part of
this side of the Moray Frith, between the bays of Cromarty
and Munlochy.  This parish is situated in the presbytery of
Chanonry, in the synod and county of Ross.  It is one of the
eight parishes comprehended within the ancient district of
Ardmeanach, or the Black Isle; so called, because the whole
make a peninsula, of which the greater part continues still
black uncultivated moor, though a good deal has been plant-
ed and improved of late.
