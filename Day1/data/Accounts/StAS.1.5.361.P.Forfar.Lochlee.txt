of June and July.  At that season 120 and upwards, tra-
verse yearly, begging wool; of whom, many seem to be
real objects of charity, but numbers of them appear to be
of a different description.  They come from Dundee, Ar-
broath, Montrose, Brechin, Stonchaven and Aberdeen, for
the above purpose.

   Rent, Proprietor, etc.-The yearly rent of the parish in
1714, amounted to L. 218; 39 wedders, at 3 s. 4 d. a-head;
31 stone and 10 lb. of butter, at 4 d. the lb; and 46 dozen
and 2 poultry, at 3 s. 4 d. the dozen; the tenants paying,
every fifth year, the double of the money rent:  By ad-
ding a fifth of the money rent, and taking the value of
the wedders, butter and poultry, in cash, the yearly rent
of the parish in 1714, amounted to L. 284: 4: 6 2/3 Sterling.
The present rent (1792) is L. 385, 12 s. Sterling.  From
time immemorial, the whole parish belonged to one heri-
tor.  For some centuries before 1714, the proprietor's fa-
mily name was Lindsay.  His mansion-house, called In-
vermark, a place about half a mile from the church, conti-
nued to be the ordinary place of his residence, until he mar-
ried the heiress of Edzell, which happened at least 200
years ago, when he removed to the castle of Edzell.  The
walls of Invermark are still entire.  In 1714, David Lind-
say, the last proprietor of that name, sold both Lochlee and
Edzell, to the Earl of Panmure.  The Honourable Wil-
liam Maule of Panmure, is the present proprietor of the 
parish.

   Tradesmen.-There are 4 wrights, 4 tailors, 3 weavers,
2 smiths, and one shoemaker in the parish.  The wrights
and smiths are but occasionally employed, and therefore
have time to attend to small crofts of land, a few black cat-
tle and sheep.  There is nothing but coarse woollen cloth
