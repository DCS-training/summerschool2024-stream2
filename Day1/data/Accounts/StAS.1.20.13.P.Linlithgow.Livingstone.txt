few or no instances had then occurred where personal ho-
nours had been bestowed; they were either annexed to lands
or to offices, and were transferred with the property, or be-
came extinct with the office.  And the barony of Living-
stone not only never was erected into a lordship, but we
are possessed of an authentic deed, to which the proprietor
of that barony was a party, dated in the 1486. 26 years af-

In the 1604 it was again acquired by the family of Linlith-

spring-well adjoining was a specific for the scrofula, when
applied by the Royal hand upon a New-year's morning be-

   As it is probable, however, that the King and his patients
seldom met here precisely in the nick of time, tradition is
silent as to the cures that were performed.
   But there are relicks of antiquities in, or connected with,
