     Statistical Account

   Fuel.-Coals may now be had at so moderate a price, and
in a few years there will also be such abundance of wood,
that it is hardly necessary to notice the present scarcity of
fuel for domestic accommodation.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church and manse were most
pleasantly situated at the eastern extremity, in the vicinity of
the Castle, until the year 1736, when they were removed to
Quarrywood, a more centrical, though more bleak situation,
nearly under the highest part of the north side of the hill.
Both are at present in pretty good repair; and the glebe
and garden, consisting of about 6 acres, are both substan-
tially inclosed with stone walls.  The stipend, including 60
merks for communion clements, is 30 L. Sterling, and 64
bolls of bear.

   Antiquities.-The remains of a Danish camp* are still
very conspicuous on the hill of Quarrywood.  It would ap-
pear that those Danes, who inhabited the burgh (burges)
in this neighbourhood, had erected it as an asylum for their
families.  It commands a view of the whole county, and a
pleasant prospect into the counties of Caithness, Sutherland,
Ross, Inverness, Nairn, Banff, and Aberdeen.  It is worthy
of Lord Fyfe's notice, and becoming his taste, in beautifying
the county, to renew this monument, and perpetuate its an-
tiquity.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Both FORDON and BUCHANAN give account of the Danes
landing in Murray, about the year 1008, when Malcolm II.
marched against them, fought, and was defeated at Forres.
In the career of their success, they sent for their families, who
enjoyed the land till they were repeatedly defeated at Gamerie
in Banff-shire, and Cruden in Buchan, where the Danish camps
are still to be seen.
