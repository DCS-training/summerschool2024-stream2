while the neighbourhood is greatly benefited by the lime,

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The air, in general, is pure, and
there are no distempers peculiar to the parish.  Many of
the inhabitants arrive at the age of 80, some at that of 90
years.  They live neither in towns nor villages; they are
employed chiefly in the open air, and are active, sober, and
industrious; they are of late much improved in their dress
and manner of living, and dwell in houses more neat and
cleanly than formerly; circumstances which must contri-
bute to health.

   Produce and Cattle.-The grain chiefly cultivated in this
parish, is oats.  Pease, beans, and barley, are also raised,
but in much smaller quantities *.  Potatoes are planted by
almost every family for their own subsistence.  Consider-
able quantities of rye-grass and clover seeds, are also sown.
No turnips, cabbages, or hemp, are raised, and little flax,
excepting some for private use.  More grain is raised than
is consumed in the parish; and much butter and cheese is
sent to the markets of Ayr and Kilmarnock, and even to
Paisley and Glasgow+.-Great attention is now given to
