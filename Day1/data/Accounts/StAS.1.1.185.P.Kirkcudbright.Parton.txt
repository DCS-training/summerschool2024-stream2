no considerable mountains, but many little hills.  The flats
and eminencies are generally covered with heath, except in
the southern border, where surze and broom used to prevail
before the improved mode of cultivation.

   Agriculture, etc.-The number of farms is between 40 and
50.  Each hath a plough.  The old Scottish plough is used
in breaking up the ground, when 3, and often 4, horses
are used a-breast.  In the subsequent ploughings, a lighter
plough, with 2 horses and 1 man, is used.  It is supposed
that 400 acres may be annually employed in raising oats, 6
or 8 in barley, and 50 in potatoes.  Potatoes make a princi-
pal article of food of the lower classes of the people, and,
with a small degree of attention, the old crop continues good
till succeeded by the new.  On the sale and exportation of
sheep, wool, black cattle and oats, the farmers depend for the
paying of their rents.  Oats are sown from the middle to the
end of March, and reaped from the end of August to the end
of September, Potatoes are planted in the beginning of April,
and are ready at Lammas.  Most part of the farms are inclo-
sed with stone dykes.  The advantages of such inclosures are
well known.  The land rent of the parish is near L. 2000.
Land sells from 27 to 32 years purchase.  The nature of the
ground in different farms is very different.  One, consisting
of 45 acres, lately let at L. 48 per annum; another, of more
than 400 acres, let for L. 40.  The rent of farms is from
L. 10 to L. 120 per annum.  Although the rents of some
farms have been even doubled within these last 30 years, yet
the condition of the people is much improved.

   Air and Distempers.-The air is falubrious, and there are
no epidemic distempers, if we except rheumatic complaints,
which, for these last 40 years, have prevailed among all ranks.
