   Sheep, Black Cattle, etc.-It is almost unnecessary to
state the number of sheep, black cattle and horses, either
in the barony, or whole parish of Chirnside, compa-
ratively, with what it was 30 or 40 years ago; for 
it is not in the superior number, but in the better
breed and condition of those animals, that the great dif-
ference appears.  It is such, indeed, in both these respects,
throughout the parish, as to be in proportion to the pre-
sent general meliorated state of the land, compared with
its former sterility.  Besides the improvement of the breed
of the sheep by commixture with the larger kinds of
Cheviot, and the North Riding of Yorkshire, which the
gentlemen farmers, and the tenants of the richest lands
have procured, even the original Lammermuir fort has
grown much in size, and in the value of their sleeces, by
their better pasture.  Of the first, none are sold lower
than 30's., and the second give a guinea, and above it.
Neither of them are exposed, as formerly, to be starv-
ed, for want of sodder in the winter storms; but both
have, besides some quantity of hay, the more ample pro-
vision of the field-turnips made for them.  Of the two,
so bred and nourished, we can reckon in the barony a-
bout 80 score; while the flocks in the extensive farms of
the two Idingtons and of Blackburn, may be computed
at near a half of that number.  The black cattle in the
barony, including in it, as before, the farms of Nine-
wells, are not fewer than 14 score.  The oxen are either
of the Fife breed, or those got at the trysts of Falkirk
and Crieff.  Some of them, when put into good condi-
tion, are sold, at the Dunfe and Berwick fairs, to Eng-
lish drovers; others are disposed of at home, either for
working cattle, or for the butcher.  The stall and tur-
