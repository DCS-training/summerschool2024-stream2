			THE UNITED PARISHES OF

         		APPLEGARTH AND SIBBALDBIE.

		PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

	          THE REV. WILLIAM DUNBAR, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

        Name and Boundaries.-APPLEGARTH is a compund of the
words Apple and Garth, the last of which denotes, both in the
Celtic and Gothic languages, an inclosure. In the Yorkshire dia-
lect, as Mr Chalmers remarks in his Calendonia, Applegarth is the
common appellation for an orchard. To the parish of Applegarth
was annexed in 1609, that of Sibbaldie or Sibbaldbye, which is
supposed by Chalmers to have obtained its name during Saxon
times, from its ahving been the Bye, or dwelling-place of some
person called Sibbald. To Applegarth was attached also the
chapelry of Dinwiddie, which, it is said, belonged of old to the
Knights Templars, who had large possessions in Annandale.
	The parish extends 5 1/2 miles in a northerly direction, and its
breadth eastward is of the same extent. The parish contains in
whole 17 1/8 square miles. It is of a triangular figure, and is bound-
ed on the N. by Wamphray; N. E. and E. by Hutton; W. by
Johnstone and Lochmaben; and S. by Dryfesdale, and that part

of Lochmaben parish which lies on the east side of the river
Annan.
        Topographical Appearances.-The high grounds in the parish,-
for they cannot be called mountains, and searcely hills,-lie on either
side of the river Dryfe; the western range commencing nearly at
the southernmost boundary, and extending in a northern direction
till it joins the Wamphray range; the eastern range is a continua-
tion of that called Quhytwoollen in Dryfesdale, running north-
wards, and joining the hilly ground of Hutton. The highest part
of the former range is Dinwiddie hill, by barometrical measure-
ment 736 feet above the level of the sea. Of the latter range,
Adder-law ir the highest ground, measuring 638 feet.
