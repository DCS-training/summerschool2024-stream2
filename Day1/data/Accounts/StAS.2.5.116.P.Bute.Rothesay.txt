  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The poor of this parish have al-
ways been superintended by the kirk-session and thier wants supplied
without recourse to assessment. The numbers of poor on the roll
in 1839 was 180, and the average sum allotted to each for the
years was L. 1, 11s. 6d. besides an allowance of coal in winter
from a yearly subscription of L.80 or L.90 for that special purpose.
twenty-four of the paupers have badges from the session, autho-
rizing them to call for alms on Saturdays at the houses of the in-
habitants of the parish. Each of them is understood to obtain by
this means what is dqual to 2s, a week. This arrangement has a
great effect in preventing general begging.
     The  funds are raised as follow:

                                                       Total,  L. 348  13  8
	It may be remarked, that a large proporation of person receiving
aid from the fund, are capable of making considerable exertions for
themselves, and require assistance chiefly in paying thier house

<FOOTNOTE>The session purchased two herarses about two years ago, which are expected to as-
?? great the revenue of the poors funds. A large pieces of ground was lately gifted
in the  Marquis of Bute for Laires, and put under trust for behoof of the poors funds.
The male of there will add considerably to the revenue in a short time.
