and lowness subjects them, in late seasons, to frost; but they
would make excellent meadows, if they were properly drained.
   All the mosses ly in this quarter of the parish and they
are very much wore out.  The largest, called, for its extent,
the meikle moss, was accidentally fired, about 1730, in the
summer season, and being unluckily very dry at the time, was
nearly consumed.  The remains of it now afford no better
fuel than turfs, which are very clayey, and not only give, but
retain a strong heat.  The soils in the centre and western
parts of the parish, are dry and light, sometimes of a deep,
sometimes of a shallow staple, well adapted for lime, and
the turnip husbandry, and no less fit, with proper cultivation
and manure, for raising heavy crops of corn and grass.  The
most westerly parts are hill grounds, and, with proper ma-
nagements would make pretty good sheep walks.

   Farms.-The size of farms it is difficult to average, as
they differ prodigiously from one another, not only in the
whole extent, but also in the quantity of the different soils
of land which make up a farm in that country; and they are
in general still under the old divisions, with very irregular
marches, as when antiquated notions of convenience, and no
idea of inclosing, or regular fields, were in view.  The rents
run from 60 L. and 70 L. to 7 L. or 8 L. for those who are accounted
farmers.  Under that rent, the possessors of land are cropers,
who frequently, however, have cattle sufficient to work a
plough.  A considerable part of the rent is paid in victual,
by the farmers, and sometimes even by the cropers; and
they are in general desirous enough to convert the victual
into money, though they will rarely give it's value.  Mul-
tures have generally been changed into paid rents, and the
tenants only pay knaveships to the miller, besides the usual
mill services.  They are bound likewise to deliver poultry, &c.
