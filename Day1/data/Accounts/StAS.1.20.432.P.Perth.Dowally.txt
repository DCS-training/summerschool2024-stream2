     FAIRS AND MARKETS.

   These are six yearly fairs in Dunkeld.  They are held
on the 1st of January, and Candlemas day, chiefly for the
sale of yarn; on 25th of March, for yarn and horses; on
9th June, (St Columba's day), for yarn and horses; on
on the 8th December, for yarn.  At these fairs a guard,
paid by the Duke of Atholl, and provided with arms, is
always in readiness to preserve the peace, and apprehend
any offenders who may be detected.
   There is a weekly market every Saturday.  On these,
and the intervening days of the week, there are sold annu-
ally 130 carcases of beef; 144 of veal; 800 of mutton,
and 20 of pork.  Calculating from the average weight of
each of these respectively, and the price at which it is sold 
per lb. the total amount of the butcher-meat sold will be
above L.2000.  There are two butchers who reside in the
town, and two who attend the weekly market of Saturday.
   The Duke of Atholl has a right to draw custom for the
various articles brought to these fairs and markets for sale.
The rate charged is small.  The rent paid by the tacksman
is L. 12 per annum.

about 1730.  There is one general meeting of the society
yearly, which, till 1776, was held always at Dunkeld, but
now alternately at Dunkeld and Cupar of Angus.  At
this meeting the office-bearers for the ensuing year are cho-
sen; the laws are enacted or repealed; complaints of mem-
bers heard, and offenders fined; and assistance given from
