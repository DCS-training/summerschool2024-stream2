                 PARISH OF STRATHBLANE.

           I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--FROM time immemorial, the name of this parish has
been the same. It is derived from the Blane, a small stream which
rises in the north-east extremity of the parish, and, after running
southwards for more than three miles, turns to the west, and flows
onwards, for more than four miles, towards the north-west. It is
generally agreed, that Blane signifies ''the warm river." The
strath of the warm river is peculiarly descriptive of the valley,
which is sheltered, in almost every direction, from the violence of
the winds.
  Extent.--The average length of the parish is rather more than
five miles. The breadth is about four. The surface comprises
about 20 square miles. Its figure approaches the form of an ob-
long square.
  Boundaries.--The parish lies in the south-west corner of Stir-
lingshire; and is bounded on the east, by the parish of Campsie;
on the south, by Baldernock and East Kilpatrick; and on the
west and north, by Killearn.
