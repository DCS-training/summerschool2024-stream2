     HINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF OAK WOODS.

   The great body of the woods should be surrounded with
a stone dyke, and no cattle ever permitted to enter them.
This, at least, is a good general rule, and ought never to be
departed from, excet in cases where circumstances render
the purchase of pasture, however expensive, absolutely ne-
cessary.  All vacant spaces should be planted with woods
suited to the soil.  If this is done, and the stool of oak is of
due closeness, the pasture in the wood must indeed be at
least but insignificant.
   Probably 20 years is nearly the best period at which to
cut oak woods.  When at that age, the stocks, on an ave-
rage, are about 14 inches in diameter, and then they cease
to send out young shoots.  If the bark, therefore, is the
principal ingredient in the value of the wood, a small in-
crease only in its quantity is to be expected after this, and
permitting the trees to stand longer, cannot be considered as
profitable.

     MISCELLANEOUS FACTS.

   The Gaetic language is spoken universally in this parish,
though all the people, at the same time, understand more or
less perfectly the English.  It is curious fact, that the hills
of King's Seat and Craigy Barns, which form the lower
boundary of Dowally, have been for centuries the separa-
ting barrier of these languages.  In the first house below
them, the English is, and has been spoken; and the Gaelic
in the first house, (not above a mile distant), above them.
   The valued rent of the parish is L. 1390 : 2 : 2.  The
real rent may amount to about L. 500.  As the farms are
of small size, not exceeding from L. 5 to L. 15 each of rent,
