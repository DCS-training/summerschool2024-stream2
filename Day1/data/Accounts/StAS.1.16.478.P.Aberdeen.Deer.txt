   The parishioners are in general, a decent, sober, charitable
people.  Agriculture, the employment of the generality, is
favourable to virtue; public worship, and the ordinances of
religion, are attended with a laudable punctuality.

   Diseases, etc.-No disease has of late years raged here
with greater mortality than a putrid sore throat.  It
chiefly attacked children, sometimes cutting off two, three,
and four of a family.  Inoculation for the small-pox
has been practised here with success.  Last year (1792) a
surgeon of this place, humanely inoculated gratis above
100 children, mostly of the lower class, of which only one
died.  Many people after all are very much averse to in-
oculation.  Consumptive complaints are not unfrequent
among the young; rheumatism afflicts those of riper years.
