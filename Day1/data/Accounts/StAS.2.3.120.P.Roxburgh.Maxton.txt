   Character, &c. of the People.-The people in general are simple in
their manners, sober, industrious, satisfied with their condition, and
attentive to the religious and other duties. They have, however, no
religious, literary, economical, or political association among them.
They are strangers to combination for any purpose whatever. They
seem willing and pleased to do their duty, without waiting for the
example or direction of the active stirring manager of some benevo-
lent institution. If a good act may be done to a neighbour, the op-
portunity of doing it is seldom neglected. If any one has been un-
fortunate, or has fallen into distress, he is sure of the sympathy and
active aid of those around him, and often to a greater extent than
they can well afford. It is pleasing to see these kindly feelings
continually showing themselves where there is evidently no motive
but a desire to do to their brother as they verily believe, and could
wish that, he would do to them.
   Among such a people, where luxury is unknown, and religion,
in a great measure, performs the part of human institutions, many
things are wanting which are thought indispensable in other places.
Here, for example, they have no lawyer, no Justice of the peace,
not even a constable, no medical man, no exciseman, no pawn-
broker, no post-office, no Seceder meetinghouse, no tradesmen of
any kind but two smiths, two rights, two tailors, two fishermen,
and one miller, all of whom are absolutely necessary to keep the ma-
chinery of society in motion. There are, however, two public houses,
which are certainly not of so indispensable a character. They are
not wanted for the accommodation of travellers, and they cannot
