rie in Bervie.  When King David campe up to Bervie, his
servant desired a fisherwoman to gut a fish for the King's sup-
"per.  Gut twa, says his Majesty:" "I'll gut three, says the
"woman:" Well, replies his Majesty, "Gut-three, for ever
"shalt thou be."  The revenue arising from the town's pro-
perty, etc. does not exceed L. 36 yearly.  Were it double
or triple the sum, it is to be doubted if it would be applied
to any useful purpose, so that the smallness of the reve-
nue is not a matter of much regret.  The inhabitants of
Bervie have contracted with a man, to bring in water to
the town by pipes; the sum necessary to desray the ex-
pense, is to be raised by a tax of 1 s. on each hearth.  It
would be of great advantage to Bervie, and the neightbour-
hood, if a harbour could be got at the water mouth, but
the expense must be a great bar to the scheme, and the sea
runs 10 high in a storm, that a small vessel could not easily
take the harbour.  A new bridge over Bervie water is to
be built soon for that purpose:  his Majesty has been plea-
sed to give L. 1000.  Several committees have been held
to consider the propriety of establishing turnpikes in this
county.
