some of it is sold in yarn; but the manufacturers complain,
that the spinners draw it beyond the grist, that they may
have the more out of their flax, which hurts the sale of
the yarn at the market.  But the spinning of yarn from
Dutch flax is the principal employment of the women,
and is computed to bring in about L. 1500 Sterling annual-

On the road from Aberdeen, Huntly and Rothemay,
through Grange, there are 4 good bridges over the 4
streams that intersect the parish; two of there bridges were
built last year, out of the vacant stipends of the neighbour-
ing parish of Rothemay, and are of great importance to
the whole country, as they are upon a well frequented
road, and across two very rapid and dangerous streams.
There is also a bridge over Isla, near the church, which
"was built in 1699, by Alexander Christie, tenant in
"Cantley, for the glory of God, and the good of the
"people of Grange," as the inscription bore, being built
to reader the church accessible to the people of Cantley,
which is the farm upon the south side of Isla.  100 merks
