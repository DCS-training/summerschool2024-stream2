the tenants that then possessed them, for such sums of mo-
ney as he could obtain, and the payment of a small yearly
feu-duty, reserving to himself, however, the tithe of corn
paid at the mills.  His successor, who was the last eccle-
siastical abbot, completed what his predecessor had be-

to it, was the last property which the abbots had in
Stryla; which, after being possessed successively by Aber
