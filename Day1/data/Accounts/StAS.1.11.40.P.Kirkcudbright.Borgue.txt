   Church, School and Poor.-The Crown is patron. The
stipends consist of a chalders of meal, 1 of bear, and 800 L.
Scotch of money, besides 40 L. Scotch for communion ele-
ments, and 3 glebes, which lie detached, and measure 16
acres. The church and manse are very much out of repair;
but the heritors, it is not doubted, will soon repair them
handsomely.  They have lately erected an exceeding good
school-house.  The school is well attended, and the emolu-
ments may be averaged at 30 L. a year.  The poor are sup-
plied from the collections in the church, which usually are
between 25 L. and 30 L. annually, and from the interest of 140 L.
of stock.  Twelve or fourteen (the number commonly on
the list), are maintained.  None of these beg from house to
house; but beggars from other districts are very numerous.

   Antiquities.-There are four or five moats in different parts
of the parish; one of which, (the Dun of Boreland), is very
remarkable.  Its situation is conspicuous, and commands a
very extensive prospect of the circumjacent country.  Its form
is exactly circular, and at the top about 40 yards diameter.
The fossee with which it is surrounded, is 10 feet deep, and
7 or 8 in breadth at the bottom.  At the distance of a bow

+It is with no small pleasure, that the author of this account has just received
intelligence, that the duty on coals is taken off The advantages of this will
soon, he felt among all ranks; and it will scarcely admit of a doubt, that in a
short time it will prove equally advantageous to the State.  For, at a moderate
calculation, the district of Galloway alone will, in ten years, contain 10,000
more inhabitants, who will pay thrice as much to Government, in osher taxes,
as is paid at present by the duty on coal.
