from his scholars.  The church, meeting-house, and school are in

   State of the Poor.-The money which supports the poor,
is annually about L. 26 Sterling.  It arises from funds in
money and heritable property, from dues at deaths and
marriages, and from the weekly collections at the church
door.  The poor on the parish list, are, at an average, about
twelve.  They receive monthly 3 s. for their support; but,
others also receive occasional supply.  There are no begging
poor in the parish.
   In the year 1782, the crop was very bad and much in-
jured.  But then, the present Earl of Mansfield, attentive
to the situation of the parish, sent 30 quarters of seed corn,
to be distributed amongst his tenants for the same quantity of
the produce in return; and also L. 30 Sterling to be distri-
buted amongst the poor of the parish; though this was not
the only time, they have experienced his bounty; sums,
nearly of the same value, being frequently sent them by his
Lordship.

   Fuel.-In summer, the chief fuel is furze, broom, and the
weedings of the young plantations; in winter, coals, which
are bought at Perth and Bridge-end, a village on the side of
the Tay, opposite to Perth, at 3 s. 6 d. the boll of 40 stones
