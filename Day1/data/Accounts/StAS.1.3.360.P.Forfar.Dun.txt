good repair; it has two lotes, one to the east, the other to
the west.  The east end of the church is stiled the choir, and
has a fount in the wall, intended, of old, for baptism.

   Name, etc.-The name of Dun seems to be taken from
the proprietor, who was called Dun of that ilk.  It is said
that one of the name of Erskine married the heiress; but
when that happened, is difficult to say, as it is known only by

Dunis, which signifies, in that language, a hill or rising
ground; and it is indeed on a ground pretty much elevated

viz. tenants which appear in the month of May, and continue
till the end of June.  They are thought by some to be salmon fry,
the catching of which has been prohibited by those who have
the salmon fishing in lease.  There are likewise plenty of
sea trouts, about 12, 18, or 20 inches in length; besides a 
trout called a sinneck, which appears in the months of July
and August, and disappears towards the end of September.

year.

   Soil and Produce.-The lands upon the river side consist
of a clay soil, and produce excellent wheat and barley.
There are about 30 bolls of wheat sown in the parish, besides
