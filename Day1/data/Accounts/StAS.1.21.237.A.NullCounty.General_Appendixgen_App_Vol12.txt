     Additional Information.

   In the Statistical Account of the parish of Cambusnethan,
given in Vol. 12th, No. 38, in a note subjoined to page 572,
mention is made that there were several persons in the parish
whose age exceeded 90 years.  As these persons are now
dead, it may not be improper to specify their names and

   The persons therein alluded to were two very respectable
ladies, Mrs Margaret and Mrs Anne Hamiltons, both daugh-

Margaret Hamilton was born on the 22d day of February
1700, (O. S.) and died on the 7th of April 1797, aged 98
years; and Mrs Anne Hamilton was born on the 16th day
of January 1703, (O. S.) and died on the 15th day of April
1796, aged 94 years.
   It is proper here to add, that their youngest brother-
german, James Hamilton, Esq. of Browncastle, (who was
also proprietor of the lands and house Muirhouse above-
mentioned,) died in June 1788, aged 91.  Such instances
