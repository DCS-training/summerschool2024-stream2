   Poor-The poor of this parish wander about, and beg from
door to door, to the grave:  For the funds; appropriated to
their use, are very inadequate to their necessities, being the
Sunday collections, which may amount to something better
than 20 L. a-year; and the interest of 18 L.; being donations
made, at different times, by the following persons, viz.

Last year Major Cameron, of Erract, sent to the writer of this
article 20 L.  Sterling, for the immediate relief of the poor
and he has since distributed among them upwards of 20 L,
more himself.  There are no stated times for dividing the
poor's money; and some are relieved oftener than others.  If
any are reduced to poverty by accident, disease, or calamity,
there is an extraordinary collection made for their relief.
