     of Moy and Dalarossie.

   Poor.-There are a number of poor people in this parish; but
most of them do something in the way of providing for their
own maintenance, and receive what aid can be given them
from the parish funds.  These funds are very inconsiderable,
being only the weekly collections, which do not exceed 4 L. or
5 L. Sterling in the year.  Such as are altogether incapable of
labouring are relieved by the neighbourhood:  But as the
practice of common begging is not restrained, many of them
betake themselves to that method of obtaining support.

   Roads and Bridges.-The road from Inverness to Perth
passes through this parish.  It was made, and is still kept in
repair, by Government.  Besides a large and useful bridge on
the river Findhorn, there is a number of smaller ones on
this road, within the parish, which were built and kept in re-
pair at the public expence.  There are roads of communica-
tion betwixt the different parts of the parish, now forming by the
statute labour; but there is so much to be done in that way,
that it will take a considerable time before these roads can
be completed.

   Inns and Alehouses.-There are in this parish 2 inns, on the
public road, and about 12 small public houses that sell whisky.
The whisky houses are exceedingly detrimental to the morals
of the people, as they are so many temptations, in every dif-
ferent part of the parish, to idleness, quarrelling, and many
other vices.-It is supposed, that the coldness of the climate
renders the use of spirits more necessary than in milder situ-
ations; but whatever may be in that, it is much to be regret-
ted, that, instead of making that moderate use of spirits, most
of the people, that resort to these small public houses, seldom
depart without going to excess.
