   Minerals, Rocks, etc.-In the Coulart hill, between Los-
siemouth amd Stotfield, there are appearances of lead:  Ma-
ny detached masses of ore are to be seen in the rocks.
Some adventrurers, however, lately came from England,
and after spending above L. 500 Sterling, could discover
no vein of ore worth the expence of working.  The hill
of Causea, or Cave-sea, consists of one uninterrupted mass
of free-stone, more than a mile long, divided into horizon-
tal strata of different degrees of thickness and hardness,
but generally soft and friable.  This hill forms a very
bold shore; and the violence of ht winds and furge, has
cut and excavated the free-stone rock so as to from many
curious atches, caves, and pyramids, of various sizes and fi-
gures.  These rocks are covered, in summer, with different
kinds of plants of variegated colours, and are frequented by
crows, pigeons, gulls, and other birds, in prodigious num-
bers.  In the summer time, the noise of the sea below, the
varied cries of the birds, the beauty of the flowers, and the
grandeur of the rocks, all heighten the scenery of the place.
There was also at Lossiemoutn, in a natural cave, a small her-
mitage, not exceeding 10 feet square, called St Gerardine's
Cave, which commanded a view of the shore as far as Cul-
len, and was adorned with a handsome Gothic door and win-
dow; but these artificial decorations were pulled down about
25 years ago, by a rude shipmaster; and in the course of 
working the quarries, the whole cave has since been totally
destroyed.  There was a spring in the rock above the her-
mitage, called St Gerardine's Well; but neither this, nor
any other springs in the parish, have acquired same for
their medicinal virtues.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The inhabitants of this pa-
rish, like all others employed in husbandry, are robust and
healthy.  Their general character is that of a sober, honest,
