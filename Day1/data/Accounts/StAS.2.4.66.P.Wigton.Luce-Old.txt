			PARISH OF OLD LUCE.

	     PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

                  THE REV. JOHN M'DOWALL, MINISTER.

		   I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--IT appears that this parish was anciently denominated
Leuce; but the northern district having been cut off and formed
into a separate parish in 1646, was afterwards called New Luce;
and the southern district Old Luce. In some old Latin docu-
ments, dated in the year 1560, it is called Vallis Lucis, (the
valley of light,)--a name probably assigned it, because the whole
origin parish was intersected by a deep and wide valley, run-

middle of which an abbey or monastery was situated,--the light of
the valley.
	Extent, Boundaries, &c.--The parish of Old Luce, lying in the
centre of Wigtonsbire, comprehends about 80 square miles, being
10 miles long, and 8 or 8 1/2 broad, and resembling in figure an
oblong square or parallelogram. It is bounded on the north, by
New Luce; on the west, by Inch and Stonykirk; on the south,
by the Bay of Luce; and on the east, by Kirkowan and Mochrum.
	Topographical Appearances.--The general aspect of the parish
is very irregular, the surface being for the most part hilly, and
containing comparatively little level land, except in the vicinity of
the Bay of Luce, and on the sides of the river, which runs through
the valley already referred to. The elevation, however of the
highest hills does not exceed 1014 feet above the level of the sea.
The climate, compared with that of other parishes in Galloway, is
temperate.
	Bay--Coast.--The Bay of Luce winds round the southern coast
of Wigtonshire, from the Mull of Galloway to Burrow-head, in
Whithorn, and comprehends at least 400 square miles. Some
parts of its coast are sandy, some gravelly, and some clayey.
Within two miles of Glenluce, it affords a harbour (Burn-foot) for
small vessels importing lime, coals, &c.; but usually vessels of
