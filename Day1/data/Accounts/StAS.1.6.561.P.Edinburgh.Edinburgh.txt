   Adding the usual proportion of one fourth of the examina-
ble persons for children, the number of inhabitants in the city
of Edinburgh in 1722 appears to have amounted to 25,420, or
some what less than 4 2/1 to each family, and if we allow 15,000
for the suburbs and the environs, the total would be 40,420
fouls.
   Maltland, in his history of Edinburgh, founding his compu-
tation of the register of burials, makes the number of the inha-
bitants in the above nine parishes in that city to amount to
48,000 at leaft, in 1753.  But that calculation is little to be
regarded, as, in 1755, an enumeration was made, at the de-
sire of the late Dr. Webster, when the numbers proved to be
as follow;

<FOOTNOTE>

   *The number of families in the East-Grayfriars parish was not specified,
but it is calculated from the proportions betwixt the families and individuals
in the preceding seven parishes.

   +The number of the families, and of individuals, in the New-Grayfriars
parish were not specified; but as in the paper communicated by Dr. Blair, a
column, supposed to refer to some prior enumeration, was inserted, the above
calculation was made from the proportion that parish bore to the left in that
column, which flood as follows:
