     Statistical Account

   The horses are either reared in the country, or imported
from Ireland.  The cattle are mostly of the true Galloway 
breed, which is to well known to need a particular descrip-
tion.  Several of the farmers deal in Irish black cattle to a 
considerable extent.  These they frequently keep in winter 
to consume part of their sodder in the sleids, and about Can-
dlemas they send them up to the English markets.  The 
sheep in the moors are of the common black-faced kind:
those on the lower lands are of the white-faced half-mug
species. A few Shetland sheep have been introduced lately,
but are not in a thriving slate.  Live-stock of every kind
has fallen very much in price in the course of last year.  This 
is ascribed by some to the war in which this country is en-
gaged.  Others again, who speak with more caution on pu-
blic affairs, ascribe it to the scarcity of money.  Whatever 
be the cause, the effect is to many poor farmers a source of 
very serious distress.  The best arable and meadow lands are 
let at 10 s. or 12 s.  the acre, in farms of considerable ex-
tent.  Some small enclosures yield at the rate 13 s.  or 
L. 1 the acre.  Moor lands, let by the lump, are had for 
1 s.  the acre, and some even lower.  As several of the 
estates are entailed, there has not of late been any consider-
able transference by sale. In the year 1786, the estate No. 1.
containing 2900 acres, was purchased for L. 10,700;  and
soon afterward let at L. 758 a-year.  About the same time
the state No. 3. containing 2400 acres, and let for L. 420,
was bought for L. 9300.

   Agriculture.-On the arable lands the modes of improve-
ment and management are so similar to those in neighbour-
ing parishes already described, that a particular account of 
them need not be given at present.  It need only be ob-
served, that such success has attended them, that the parish
