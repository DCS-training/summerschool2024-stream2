to incapacitate the mind for the serious and sustained reflection on
spiritual things essential to the advancement of vital religion, and
to rivet its powers of attention on the ever-changing aspect of
passing events.  The extent to which the element now mentioned,
or the publications formerly adverted to, issued as they are in
monthly, weekly, and even daily shoals, from an ever-teeming
press, actually exert an unfavourable influence on the religious
sentiments of the community, it would not be easy to overrate.
That it must be very great, and that, in consequence, the present
condition of society is calculated much more to weaken than to
confirm the religious impressions received in early years, are facts
which, it is presumed, no impartial observer will feel disposed to
call in question.
   Such, then, being the bearings on religion of the actual state of so-
ciety, the character of the education tendered to the young obviou-
ly acquires an immeasurably increased importance, since it is evident
that it is only an education thoroughly religious that can apply to
the evils above pointed out an effectual remedy.  Works of noxious
tendency will then only cease to be poured forth from the press,
when, through the abiding influence of early religious impressions,
there shall have been eradicated from the public mind the de-
praved appetites which they now pamper; and then only will the
evils necessarily incident to the extended range of our commercial
and manufacturing interests be successfully counteracted, when
the principles of those occupied with them shall have been pre-
viously established on the solid foundation of a scriptural, rational,
and practical religion.
   The all-important question then comes to be,-is the system
of education now commonly pursued, calculated to meet the emer-
gency which has arisen, and so to fix the religious principles of
the young as to steel their hearts against the corrupting influences
to which in after years they will have to stand exposed?  It were
well, indeed, if this question could be answered in the affirmative;
but the undeniable fact, that the religious education of youth has
never commanded even a tithe of the attention to which its para-
mount importance so justly entitles it, forbids us to indulge the
hope that such an answer can with truth he returned.  In fact,
so little importance has been attached to the department of reli-
gious instruction, that numerous instances are not wanting, more
particularly of late years, in which attempts have been made to
have it authoritatively excluded from the school curriculum.  Of
