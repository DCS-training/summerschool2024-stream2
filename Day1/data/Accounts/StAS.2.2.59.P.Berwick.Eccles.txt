preceding census.

   Language, Customs, &c. of the People.-The language spoken
by the common people corresponds with that of the greater part
of the Lowlands. One peculiarity, however, in the pronunciation
of the syllable ch, pertains to this parish, as well as to the rest of
Berwickshire. Thus, cheap is pronounced sheap; church, shurch.
   A curious custom connected with marriage is still kept up by
the youths here. Once a-year, or oftener, according to circum-
stances, all the men who have been married within the last twelve-
month are creeled. This consists in having a creel or basket sus-
pended to the individual's shoulders, and, while he runs with all
his speed from his own house to that of his next new-married
neighbour, he is pursued by the unmarried men, who endeavour
to fill his basket with stones. The wife, following armed with a
knife, strives to relieve her husband of his burden, by cutting the
rope which attaches the basket to his person.

true number, because no accurate account is kept of the interments in Birgham
churchyard.
