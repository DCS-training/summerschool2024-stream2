   Uninh bited House.-Of these there are two in a great
state of decay, viz. the castle of Ardvrack, the residence of
Donald-Bane-More Macleod, laird of Assint; it was built
in the 1597 or 1591; the figures are rather worn.  It was
a place of strength and defence in its day.
   The other house was built by the Earl of Seaforth's son,
in a modern manner, of an elegant figure, and great ac-
commodation.  It had fourteen bed-chambers, with the
conveniency of chimnies or fire-places.  Both houses are
situated by the north side of Loch Assint, and not far from
the parish kirk.

   Number of Cattle, etc.-It was formerly mentioned, that
this barony and parish was divided into 32 oxgates of land.
Some of them are more, and others are less rated by the
old valued rent, as they may have been judged of greater
or less value, according to the extent, etc.  However, it
is highly probable that the following calculation may be
pretty sure.  Then, taking all the oxgates, one with the
other, at an average 120 to each:
