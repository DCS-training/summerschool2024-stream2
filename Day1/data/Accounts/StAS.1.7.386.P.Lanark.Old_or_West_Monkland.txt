To 6000 tons of grain and meal, at 8 s. per ton,
  which is half the price now given along the
  Shotts road for cartage of a ton,                      2400   0   0
Lime from West Lothian to the middle ward of
  Lanarkshire, for agriculture, and for Cleland
  and Clyde iron-works, at least 20,000 tons per
  annum, at 1 s. per ton,                                1000   0   0
Coal to Glasgow, and for exportation from
  Clyde, 20,000 ton, at 1 s. per ton.  The coal
  sold at Glasgow is 140.000 tons a-year, and
  the exportation increasing, as vessels are now
  detained there wanting to be loaded with coal,         1000   0   0
4000 tons of Lancashire iron-ore yearly, for the
  Cleland and Cleugh iron-works, at 1 s. per ton

2000 tons of iron-stone to the iron-works in the
  west, from the adjacent mines, at 6 d. per ton,          50   0   0
9000 passengers may be supposed to go along
  the Canal from Edinburgh to Glasgow, and
  from Glasgow to Edinburgh, and to the in-
  termediate country, as 3000 went last year a-
  long the Great Canal; therefore stating their
  toll to the Canal at 1 s. each, is                      450   0   0

<FOOTNOTE>

The number of tons of goods, wines, etc. from Leith to E-
dinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Leith, for want of time can-
not yet be ascertained; but is immense, and supposed to be year-
ly considerably above 50,000 tons, which might be brought up
into the city by a Canal for 8 d per ton, which now pays on an
average z s. 6 d. per ton land carnage, and 4 s. for wines.
   Stone for building, and lime from Lord Morton's, at 1 s. per
ton, the quantity cannot be ascertained till the builders make
calculations, but would be very considerable.
   Iron-stone from-Mr Houston of Calderhall's to Carron, at 1 s.
per ton; but as the iron-stone is of a superior quality, and will
be wrought and carried at a cheaper rate than the Carron Com-
pany is now supplied, the consumption, in all probability, would,
burn out very great.
