of notice is the House of Torrie, which is finely situated, and has
a handsome appearance. A valuable collection of paintings,
which once gave to it an interest, fell by bequest, at the death of
the late Sir John Erskine, Bart., to the University of Edinburgh.
                                III.-POPULATION.
   By referring to the average annual number of births and bap-
tisms, the population may be estimated at 1250 in the year 1640;
at 1800 in 1670; and at 1550 in 1680. During what may be
considered to have been the most flourishing period of the history
of the parish, between 1770 and 1780, the population, by a simi-
lar reference, may be estimated at from 1800 to 1900 souls. In
1755, the return of the population made to Dr Webster was
1635; and, in 1792, it is stated in the former Statistical Account
at 1600.

       1836,	   643	       851	   1494

   In the enumeration of 1836, seamen belonging to registered
vessels are included; a class excluded from the Government enu-
merations of the four preceding periods. These are 18 in num-
ber. The actual increase of population since 1831 has been oc-
casioned by the re-opening of Torrie colliery, and the influx in
consequence into the parish of 13 families of colliers, consisting of
65 souls.
   Of the population in 1836, residing in villages, that of Torry-
burn was 655, of Torrie or Newmill, 394; of Crombie Point, 81
and of Cromble, 47.

   During the last thirty or forty years, the register is not complete ;
parents not unfrequently neglecting to have the names of their
children inserted in it ; while unhappily, there are families who
are altogether indifferent about religious ordinances, and whose
children in consequence are unbaptized.  Including those which
have not been inserted in the register, the average annual number
