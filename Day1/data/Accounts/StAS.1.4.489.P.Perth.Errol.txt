temper and manners, they are gay, cheerful and active.
The higher ranks are opulent, and the lower have it in
their power, from the great wages they can earn, to pur-
chase the conveniencies of life.  They are far removed
from sordidness, and are not unsusceptible of generosity, of
which they have given proof on several occasions.  As the
people equal their neighbours in useful, and far surpass
them in elegant accomplishments, it is expected that they
will be exemplary also in that devout and religious de-
meanour, which gives every embellishment its true lustre
and dignity.

   Church, School, Poor.-The church was built in 1765.
The manse above 60 years ago; has had some inconsiderable
repairs since that time, and is still in a tolerable condition.
John Allen, Esq; of Errol is patron.-There is only one
established school, though, from the inconvenience of send-
ing children to a distance, others are maintained in diffe-
rent quarters.  The parish schoolmaster has 200 merks Scots
of salary, 1 s. 4 d. on every marriage, 8 d. on every baptism,
and 3 1/2 d. on every certificate.  He has besides a small fee
for doing the business of the kirk-session.  The office is
judged to be worth L. 50 Sterling a-year.-The poor on the
roll at present, besides some who get occasional aid, are 36.
The distribution for their support amounts to more than L. 70
a-year.  The means for furnishing it are the weekly collec-
tions at the church, which just now may be reckoned L. 40;
the interest of L. 600, which is a fund belonging to the
poor, and the duties arising from marriages and burials.
No assessment has for some time been levied from the pa-
rish.
