this canal. The expense was about L. 400,000. The object of
the canal was the conveyance of coals, of manure, of goods, and
passengers. In this respect it has been beneficial to Edinburgh;
but, on the whole, the speculation has been anything but a pro-
fitable one to the shareholders. One error in the construction of
the canal was, not continuing it on to Leith; another was, the
narrowness of the canal, in consequence of which the size of the
boats was limited, and their progression greatly impeded.
   Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway.-This railway was commenced
in 1827, and opened in 1831. The line commences at St Leo-
nard's depot; and terminates on the banks of the South Esk at
Dalhousie, a distance of 81 miles. At the commencement of the
line, there is a descent of 116 feet; and a stationary engine is here
employed. The rest of the line is very nearly a level. A tun-
nel, 570 feet in length, passes through the south side of Arthur's
Seat. About 3 1/4 miles from Edinburgh a branch oes off to Mus-
selburgh, and another branch to Leith. The chief object of con-
structing this railway was for the transport of coals, corn, and ma-
nure; but it is also well frequented by passengers. Horses are em-
ployed in the wagons, as the act does not permit locomotive en-
gines. The original stock consisted of L. 57,000 in L. 50 shares to
which was subsequently added L. 32,000. And, including the
outlay on the branches, the total outlay is L. 150,000, which yields
about 4 per cent.
   About 100,000 tons of goods and 300,006 passengers are an-
nually conveyed on it. This railway has now (1845) been pur-
chased by the North British Railway Company.
   The Edinburgh, Leith, and Newhaven Railway.-An act was
obtained for this railway in 1836. Considerable delay took place
in going on with it; but in 1843 it was opened from Trinity to
Scotland Street. A tunnel from this point to the east end of
Princes Street is going on, and will complete the line, making 2 1/2
miles. The capital is L. 100,000.
   The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.-An act was obtained
for this railway in 1838, and the works were finished and the rail-
way opened in the spring of 1842. It commences at the Haymar-
ket, Edinburgh, and terminates near George's Square, Glasgow,
extending about 46 miles in length. It crosses the river Almond
by a noble viaduct of 36 arches, each 50 feet in span. The line
is, on the whole, very level, the steepest gradient being 1 foot in
880, with the exception of the inclined plane on approaching Glas-
