     Agriculture, etc.-The field productions are chiefly oats,
some rye, a little bear and barley, and here and there a
few ridges of peas.  Not wheat nor beans: nor have tur-
nips, till of late, been sown in the fields, though now be-
coming common.  Every farmer raises potatoes for the use
of his family; generally some likewise for feeding swine
and black cattle, but chiefly the former.  A few years ago
there were no fruit-trees in the parish, nor are there yet
any deserving the name.  A very fine young orchard is
now planted at Raehills, at the manse, and some other places.
Forest-trees are nearly as scarce; but from the names of
many places, such as Lochwood, Woodend, etc. where
there is now very little wood, it is evident, that this, like
most part of Scotland, once abounded in trees.  Besides
former plantations, 150 acres were planted last winter by
the Earl of Hopetoun.  Sheep, which were once to plenty,
are now reduced to about 1500, and succeeded by horses
and black cattle.  The sheep are mostly still the common
black faced Scotch sheep.  Indeed the only exceptions are
those at Raehills, part of which are Spanish breed, and
the rest a cross breed, known in this country by the name
of Long Sheep.  Cows and horses are rather more nume-
rous than formerly, there being 295 cows, and 111 horses,
and latter almost solely for husbandry, with a few young
ones, partly for sale, and partly to keep up the old stock.
Besides the milk-cows already mentioned, there may, at an
average, be 450 black cattle, part sattening, but most only
rearing.  There is a strong prejudice prevails all over this
country against horned cattle.  They bring at least 10 s.
a head less than those without horns, of the same weight
and quality, probably because the age of horned cattle can-
