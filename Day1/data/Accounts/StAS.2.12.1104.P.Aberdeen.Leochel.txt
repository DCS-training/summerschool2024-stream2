        This gives as the mean temperature of the year 44&deg;.2 nearly.
The number of fair days, 206; and of days in which rain or snow
fell, 159. The wind blew from the E. 8 days, S. E. 82, S. 23,
S. W. 116, W. 10, N. W. 83, N. 7, and N. E. 36. It thus ap-
pears that our prevailing winds are the S. W. the N. W. and the
S. E. winds. The S. W. is the genial point, the N. W. the
stormy one, and the S. E. the wet one. The strongest gales are
from the N. W., of which there was a remarkable instance on the
night between the 11th and 12th March 1842, when it blew a per-
fect hurricane, overthrowing corn-stacks, damaging the roofs of
houses where not slated, and laying prostrate trees, to a melan-
choly extent. Upwards of 200 trees fell in the wood of Craigievar,
though by no means a large plantation.
         Climate.-Both Leochel and Cushnie have long bad an evil
report, on account of the coldness and lateness of the climate,
and the consequent uncertainty of the crops. When Gilderoy
and his gang of freebooters haunted the hills of Cushnie in the
beginning of the Seveenth century, they are said to have de-
clared them to be the coldest in Scotland.
	There can be no doubt that, on account of the great elevation
of the district, and its mountainous character, together with the
nature of the soil, the seasons are from ten to fourteen days later
than in the lower part of the vale of Alford, and the adjoining
vale of Cromar. The air is also keen and bracing, but, on the
whole, conducive to health and longevity, of which the fifty years'
incumbency of Mr Thomas Reid at Leochel, and Mr Francis
Adam at Cushnie, in the last century, was no unsatisfactory proof.
In confirmation of this, and also in illustration nf the prevalent dis-
eases, it may be stated, that, of 49 persons who have died in the pa-
rish during the last four years, 1839,1840, 1841, and 1842, twenty-
one have died from old age and general decay of nature, chiefly
