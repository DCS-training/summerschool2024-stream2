     Statistical Account

Indeed, the vulgar tradition is, that, a few centuries ago, it
was wholly a wood or forest.  There are still some natural
wood-lands in the interior parts of the parish; and several
small plantations of barren timber have been made lately,
which thrive well.  Very many attempts are now making to
rear fruit orchards in the parish; but, owing to the extreme
thinness and lightness of the soil, and the unfavourable expo-
sure of this part of the country to the south-westerly winds,
do not promise much success.

   Fish, etc.-The kinds of fish taken here are salmon, white
slounders, plaise, some soles of a very large size, skate, and,
very rarely; turbot; but the great staple is cod, of which
large quantities, and some of excellent quality, are taken here,
and carried to Dumfries, and other neighbouring smaller towns,
and fold at from 1 d. to 3 d. per pound.  Of shell fish, large
quantities of cockles and muscles are found on the coast; al-
so shrimps, wilks, and other smaller kinds, of little value.  No
companies are associated here for the purpose of carrying on
any fisheries.  Most part of the inhabitants, however, near
the coast, are occasionally employed in fishing, but all as single
adventurers.  The shallowness of the water near the shore,
and the roughness of the sea in the cod fishing season, render
the use of boats in fishing dangerous, and almost impracticable.
The shores produce 15 or 20 tons of kelp once in 5 or 6
years; an article reduced nearly one half in price since the
barilla act was paired in 1781.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church, which is situated near the
S. W. corner of the parish, one mile N. from the frith, and
the same distance E. from the water of Urr, was built in
1771 Is very plain but large and commodious.  The manse,
which stands about a quarter of a mile N. E. of the church,
