ago.  This cut is about 24 feet in width, and 6 in depth.
The descent is so very small, that the water appears gene-
rally to be stagnant.  The lands adjacent are low and flat,
which, with other circumstances, expose them to frequent
inundations.  This would not be altogether unfavourable
to their agricultural improvements, could these floodings be
kept under controul.  This, perhaps, could be easily ac-
complished by small embankments and sluices, or kinds of
locks, erected in proper places, for the management of the
water.  At present, the damage occasionally sustained on
these lands is very considerable.  No encouragement is
held out to the farmer to institute any kind of improve-
ments upon them.  Much good soil is carried away by in-
undations, or in a great measure ruined by stones and gra-
vel thrown upon it.  Lime and dung, that may be applied
for their fertilization, are sometimes carried off, or much
injured by the water; and the crop, especially in harvest,
is always in danger of being wholly lost.  A navigable ca-
nal through this part of the country, from Perth to Criess,
could be made at a small expence, and would be of great
advantage to a large and populous district.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 3472: 1: 8
Scots; and the real rent may be about L. 1500 Sterling.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's account in
1755, the number of inhabitants of Madderty amounted to

makes a decrease of 165.

   Agriculture.-Husbandry here has not been carried to
that state of perfection to which it has arrived in some dis-
tricts of the county.  A climate rather cold and wet, and a
soil of a considerably stiff clay in most places, have contri-
buted to retard, in this neighbourhood, the advancement
