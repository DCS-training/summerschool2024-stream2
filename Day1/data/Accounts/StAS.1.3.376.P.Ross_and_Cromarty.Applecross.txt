tion, in trade or manufactures, much of the character of the
people must depend, either on the virtue or the caprice of
their superiors; for though local jurisdictions be abolished,
there is still a species of despotism remaining, by which the
displeasure of the superior is equivalent, in its effects, to the
punishment of the law.

   Population.-From the account, published by the Society for
propagating Christian Knowledge, in the 1774, there were
1100 examinable persons in the parish.  By an accurate enu-
meration, recently made, there are 1734 souls, of which
number 897 are females.  In Dr Webster's report, the num-
ber is only 835.  At an average of four years, the number
of births amount to 68, and of marriages to 9.  There be-
ing five burial places in the parish, besides the church-
yard, the number of burials cannot be ascertained with cer-
tainty.  The increasing population of the parish is evident,
to which the cultivation of potatoes, and the abolition of
servitudes, greatly contributes:  For, prior to the introduction
of this useful root, a general scarcity pervaded the Highlands.
By the abolition of servitudes, the tenant is put into posses-
sion of own industry, which was formerly settered by sti-
pulated services, in the different seasons, to the superior, ex-
acted with rigour, and only accepted of in the best weather,
in an unsteady climate.  Communicating the small pox by
inoculation, is of so very recent a date in this parish, that it
could as yet have but little influence.  Religious prejudice
opposed it, but experience hath now established its utility.
In the year 1789 the mortality was so great, that only 1
in 13, of those who caught the infection the natural way, re
covered.  Soon afterwards, a man in no respect noted for ac-
quiered knowledge, in this and 3 of the neighbouring parishes,
inoculated about 700 persons, of which number only 8 died.
