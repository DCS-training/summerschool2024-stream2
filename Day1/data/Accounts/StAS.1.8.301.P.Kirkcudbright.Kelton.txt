     of Kelton.

There are no mortifications in Kelton for the use of the poor.
The church was rebuilt in the year 1743.  In 1783, a large
aile was added to it; and still, it is by far too small for the
accommodation of the people.

   Fuel.-Peats are the fuel that has been commonly used
in Kelton; but they are now become very scarce, as the
moss in most places, is nearly exhausted.  No coal has yet
been found in this country, and the expence of that article
from England is exceedingly high.  Coals, at present, in the
port of Kirkcudbright, are sold st 1 L. 8 s. Sterling per ton,
exclusive of cartage, which, to the consumer in Kelton, raises
the price to about two guineas per ton *.

   Rent, Heritors, etc.-The rental of Kelton, as it stands
upon the Cess Roll, is 3598L. Scotch.  The real rent is above
4500 L. Sterling.  There are 18 Heritors in the parish, 7 of
whom reside.

   Villages and Markets.-There are two villages in the pa-
rish, both upon the military road, about a mile and a half
distant from each other.  At the south west village, called
Rhonhouse or Kelton Hill, there is held on the first Tuesday
after the 17th day of June, O. S. an annual horse fair, the
largest, perhaps, of any in Scotland, where there is, generally,
a very fine shew of all sorts of horses.  To this fair, vast
numbers of horse-dealers resort from England, Ireland,
and the east, south, and west of Scotland.  Many chapmen
and hawkers frequent Kelton Hill fair.  Upon the hill ad-
joining to the village, where the fair is held, many large and
Well covered tents are erected by people from Dumfries,
