   The lists, from which the above account is taken, do not
enable the writer to say precisely, what may be the propor-
tion of males and females in the parish; but, from the
register of baptisms, it would seem, that they are nearly
equal.  There are seven farms in the parish, some of
them very small, containing 7 families and 40 souls.

   The annual average of births, marriages and deaths, as
appears from the registers, at present, are,

           Births.      Marriages.   Burials.
   Males,     74  147      37          69
