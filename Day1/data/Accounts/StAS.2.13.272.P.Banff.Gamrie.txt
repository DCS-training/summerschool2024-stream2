which few can venture without fear and trembling, except the na-
tives. From the tops of these braes, as they are called, one could
almost fancy he might peep down the chimneys of the houses;
and so abrupt is the rising of the ground in some places, that one
house of three stories has them all ground floors, one entrance
being at the front, another at the back, and the third at an end.
On the east side of the bay, the little fishing village of Crovie lies
about a mile from Gardenstown, with the one gable-end of the
houses to the Sea, and the other to the land, and this last is bored,'
as it were, into the'bank, like a brood of young sea-fowl, nestling
with their heads tinder the dams; and nearly at the same dis-
tance on the west side, stands the old church and church-yard, on
a ledge of the hill's brow; which one would think in equal danger
of being smothered by the hill hanging over it, and of being under-
mined by the sea below.
   From the bay of Gamrie alone of all the coast, except at the
western extremity, before the high rocks commence, the land rises
gradually, that is, from the top of the braes, with more or less ac-
clivity, for upwards of a mile into the interior.  The most singu-
lar appearance of all the other coast is, that it is not the termina-
tion of higher lands from the interior, but that it slopes down from
the sea towards the south, sometimes immediately, but generally
after a few furlongs of plain on the top, and forms glens parallel
with the shore, which are scarcely less admired than the shore it-
self, for their rich verdure and picturesque. scenery. The rocks
themselves, or narrow hills between these glens and the sea, are
generally covered at their tops with heath; and to a person stand-
ing on their highest eminences, and surveying the wide extending
plains, woods, and mountain-tops southward and westward, and
the threatening ocean north, the reflection can hardly fail of of-
fering itself, that these strong barriers of the mighty deep have,
been placed before its proud waves by the hand of Omnipotence,
as a memento of his resistless fiat, "Hitherto shalt thou come,
and no further."
   Another circumstance that diversifies much the appearance of the
parish is, that the rocks on the coast are not carried wholly in a
continuous chain from end to end, but are broken in upon with
chasms or cross dens to their very bottoms, appearing as if the
rocks had been rent asunder by some great convulsion. In the
zigzag projections of the opposite sides of these cross dens, each
protuberance of the one corresponds with a like opening of the
