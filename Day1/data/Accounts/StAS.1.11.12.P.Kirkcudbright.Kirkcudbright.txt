     Statistical Account

a mile's distance, within Little Ross, on the W. side of the
island, there is a small but safe harbour, called Balmagan
Bay.  At 4 hours flood, there is a depth of 12 or 15 feet
water for vessels to ride in, either at spring or neap tides;
besides mooring, and sufficient room for 20 large vessels to
lie, on a soft clay bottom.

   Bay.-About 2 1/2 miles within Little Ross, on the E. side,
there is a large bay, called Torr's Lake, or Manx-man lake,
where more than too large vessels may lie in safety, upon a
soft mud or clay bottom.  At 4 hours flood, there is a depth
of 14 or 16 feet water in this bay, either in spring or neap
tides.  Two perches are placed on the right hand, and one
fixed at the point of St. Mary's Isle, to direct vessels to sleer
in without danger.

   Bar, etc.-Of St. Mary's Isle there runs a bar, nearly across
the harbour.  At ordinary spring tides the depth is about 20
feet water; and vessels may either pass over, or run channel-
course close in with the rocks on the S. shore, according to the
wind and time of the tide.  After passing the bar, the channel
becomes narrow; and it is necessary that large vessels should have
a leading wind, to carry them up the river.  Upon the shore, close
by the town, there is a fine shelving beach, where the shipping
lie, or ride at anchor in the channel.  Here the depth is 8 feet
at low water, and 28 at high water.  The rise being about
20 feet, the river is navigable to Tungland; that is, 2 miles
above the town.  There is sufficient water for vessels of 200
tons, though it is but seldom that any except coasting sloops
ascend so high.  The distance from the entrance into the har-
bour, up to the town of Kircudbright, is 5 miles; and the
widest part, at the point of St. Mary's isle, is 1 mile and 3
quarters.
