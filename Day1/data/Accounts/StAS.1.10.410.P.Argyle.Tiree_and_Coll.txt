for a mile inwards.  There is a good place for a quay by it.
It were to be wished that this bay was better known, being
most convenient for vessels which do not hold through the
sounds, and might prevent many shipwrecks, one of which
happened so lately as March last.  There are also on the S.
side of Coll, Loch-lothuirn and Loch-Breacachy, stations
where vessels frequently anchor, and which might be much
improved.  A knowledge of these harbours is the more ne-
cessary, as there are in many places on the coasts a great
swell, strong currents, and many, rocks, as Sceir-mhor west-
ward, and the Cairn of Coll eastward.

   Sheep, Black Cattle, and Horses.-A few years ago there
were at least 14,000 sheep in there isles.  The Laird of
Coll banished them almost out of his lands.  The inclemency
of the seasons reduced them in Tiry.  There are not now
above 1100 in the parish.  Though in other countries a most
beneficial stock, they are most destructive, especially to Tiry.
There is not a sufficient range for them.  They do not thrive
in summer owing to certain weeds; nor in winter on account
of the wetness of the pasture.  Where the grass is thin and
short, they tear up by their feet the very roots for food.
They lodge in hollows for shelter, and so break the sward,
and expose the sand to be driven by the winds, whence whole
fields are ruined, becoming white banks.  Tiry pasture is al-
ready too fine.  Sheep convert the little coarse grass there is
into a finer pile, to the great prejudice of black cattle, as it
subjects them, when ferried to another country, to the dis-
temper called murrain or bloody urine, and consequently re-
duces a third of their price, till they get one winter's season-
ing elsewhere.  Yet if the sheep were banished, it would be
necessary to contract for years with sheep-graziers, whereby
wool might be provided to the inhabitants at a moderate rate.
