sheep.  Its various lakes, and the streams issuing from
them, render Abdie an eligible situation for maltsters,
manufacturers, bleachers.  That it is well adapted for
that kind of machinery that is moved by water, appears
by the mills at present working in the parish:  they are
meal mills 5; fulling mills 2; lint mills 2.  On consider-
ing these circumstances, and the vicinity of the populous
towns named above, one may well be surprised that no
manufacturing work of any extent has yet been establish-
ed in Abdie.  The situation and command of water is
inviting, materials are at hand, and labourers would not
be wanting.-Good is balanced here with some evil.  From
the unevenness of the grounds, many places are difficult
of access; the roads are in bad  repair; some of the
marshes cannot be easily drained; the harvest on the
high grounds is often late.  by the industry of the inha-
bitants, the example and improvements of the age, and
the police of the country, many of the disadvantages that
now press upon our observation, may be removed at some
future period; but the hills, and coldness, and difficulty of
access to many places, must remain.  And from the pre-
sent state of property, there is little reason to expect, that
the gentlemen, in whose hands it is placed, will soon re-
store, and return to the seats of their predecessors, to
spread a portion of their wealth over the barrenness of the
mountains, and to gladden the vallies with their presence.
