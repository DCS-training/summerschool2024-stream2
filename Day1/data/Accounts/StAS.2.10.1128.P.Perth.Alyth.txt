	dues, and penalties.  The assessment is levied according to the va-
	lued rent of each heritor, the half being laid on the tenants according
	to the real rent.  A commission of 5 per cent. is allowed to the collec-
	tor.  Of the sum collected, L. 412, Is. 6d. was expended in the sup-
	port of I he regular paupers.  There is a mortification of L. 30, sub-
	ject to the annuity tax on the Ballindoch estate, administered by trus-
	tees,for clothing and educating five boys and five girls.  The interest
	of various sums, amounting in all to L.90, is placed at the disposal
	of the kirk-session for the education of poor children, and a consi-
	derably greater sum is annually applied to this object.  The me-
	thod of assessment was resorted to so early as 1776, and has since
	been continued without intermission.     It is a curious fact, that it
	was then debated whether the poor were to be relieved in this way
	or by a system of licensed begging.  Whatever may be thought of
	the latter alternative, it may be safely said that the former is a very
	bad one, and only to be justified on the plea of insurmountable ne-
	cessity, which certainly did not exist here at the time when an as-
	sessment was first imposed.  Pauperism, an evil which " grows by
	what it feeds on," has for many years been advancing rapidly and
	steadily in this parish.  Many perrons still make most praiseworthy
	exertions to keep themselves and their families from what they.
	justly regard as a degradation, but the aversion to receive paroclii-
	al aid is perceptibly diminishing.  It is to be hoped that the Com-
	mission at present inquiring into this subject may be able to sug,
	gest some means for checking the progress of this alarming evil,
	which threatens, in this and many other parishes, to become a se-
	rious burden upon property, and which has already exercised a de-
	basing influence on the character of the population.
