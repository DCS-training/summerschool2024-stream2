   Fishery.-The salmon-fishings at Aberdeen employ a
considerable number of men, and are attended with no small
profit to the persons concerned in them.  They commence
annually on the 11th of December, and end on the 19th
of September.  The fishings on that part of the river Dee
which belongs to the parish of Old Machar, consist of seven
Cavels:

Don, in Old Macbar parish, belongs to Mr Paton of Grand-
home, and is appropriated to the amusement of the pro-
prietor, and of such Gentlemen as, by his permission, angle
on that part of the river.  Below that, all the way down
to Seaton, the river on both sides belongs to the proprie-
tors of the cruive fishing.  The cruives lie at Gordon's Mills.
They are put into the river as soon as the weather will
