		PARISH OF CARSPHAIRN.

	PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

	   THE REV. DAVID WELSH, MINISTER.

	   I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Situation, and Extent.--THE name of this parish, which
is frequently written Carsefern, is probably derived from carse and
fern,--as the plain on which the church is situate, was, at the time
of the first erection of the church, no doubt covered with fern.
The parish is situate on the sloping side of that mountainous ridge
which separates Kirkcudbright from Ayr, and has a southern ex-
posure. On the north, it is bounded by the parishes of Dalmel-
lington and New Cumnock; on the east, by the parish of St
John's, Dalry; on the south, by Kells; and on the west and snuth-
west, by the parishes of Straiton and Minnigaff.
	The figure of the parish is nearly circular. It extends from
north-west to south-east about ten miles, and from north-east to
south-west about nine miles, and contains about 88 square miles.
	The church is situate nearly in the centre of the parish, and
the hills and mountains rise around forming a kind of amphithea-
tre. The parish, with very trifling, exceptions, may be said to be
altogether mountainous or hilly.
	Surface and General Appearance.--The higher mountains are
verdant to their summits; but the lower hills are generally cover-
ed with heath, and are interspersed with bogs of peat of consider-
able extent. The lower hills have growing among the heath or
on the boggy ground, a sharp kind of grass, which in the early
part of the season looks green; but as the season advances, and
in autumn, it assumes a very brown appearance, and in the winter,
it is carried like chaff by the wind.
	Rivers and Lakes.--This parish is thickly indented with moun-
tain streams. The largest stream, while it continues in the parish, is
the Deugh. It loses its name, however, on joining  the Ken,
