though, as is every other town, a few houses may be occa-
sionally unoccupied, yet in general there is a demand, and 
the building of new houses is found a profitable application
of money.-The modern average of students at the philo-
sophy college is 100; of ditto at the divinity college is 48.
No regular authentic list of students at the philosophy col-
lege has been kept till of late years; but by examining the 
matriculation book, and allowing that the number of new
students formerly bore the same proportion to the total that 
it now does, it should seem that the average of students at
the philosophy college was, from 1738 to 1747, 56; from
1757 to 1766, 79; and from 1773 to 1782, 88: Hence it 
appears, that the resort of students to St Andrew's conti-
nues to be on the increase.  The greatest number in any
one year, in recent times, is 137.  The number of students
in divinity also increase, as the average from 1773 to 
1782, is only 30.  The greatest number in any one year du-
ring that period is 35.  Greatest number since that time, 54.
The greatest number of students at the university in any one 
year, 179.-Besides the parochial Established ministers,
there is in St Andrew's an Episcopal clergyman, who has
an annual pension from Queen Anne's bounty, and a mi-
nister of the Burgher Seceders; there is but one family of 
Antiburgher Seceders.
