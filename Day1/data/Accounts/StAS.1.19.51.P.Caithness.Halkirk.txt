     of Halkirk.

A deep, large, well contrived ditch secures it on the north;
and I have reason to believe, that it was continued down
to the river, which secures it on that quarter.  It has the
appearance of being fortified also with other outworks, such
as walls, moats, etc. which have been all demolished, when
the gardens about it were first planned or enlarged.  It is
not known by whom, or when it was built, though it is
the current report, that it was built and inhabited by the
Harolds, who came over here from Denmark, but more
immediately from Orkney, where they bore a princely
sway, as well as here.  But very ancient as this fabric cer-
tainly is, there is the remains of another very near it, to
the south, that seems to excel it far in antiquity, and to
have been not inferior to it in strength.  Nothing of it re-
mains, but a huge unshapely cairn of stones, which yet in-
dicate it to have been once a very large and strong fastness.
I suspect that below it are subterraneous vaults and com-
munications to other works, necessary for defence and secu-
rity in those days of violence and constant invasion.
   But the beauty of the whole are the remains of a much
more modern building, which was extremely well begun,
but never finished.  It stands close to the bank of the river,
below the fabrics above mentioned.  The design is cer-
tainly grand and magnificent, and worthy of its princely
site; and had it been finished, it would, in all appearance,
have been one of the finest, and most stately, and commo-
dious edifices in the north, according to the style of those
times.  The work was carried on a few feet above the
vaults, which were completely finished, and are indica-
tions of the greatness, majesty, and elegance of what was
to be above them.  There, unluckily, the building was
stopped, and never was resumed or attempted after-
wards, though what was done already was a very great
temptation to it.
