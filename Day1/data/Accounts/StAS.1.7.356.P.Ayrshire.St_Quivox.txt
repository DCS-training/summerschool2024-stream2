but seldom.  Lime costs 5 d. per boll, and the carriage 4 d.
the kilns being 6 or 7 miles distant.  Hence, at the rate of
100 bolls per acre, it colts the farmers 3 L 15 s.  Their lows
for two successive years, 6 or 7 Winchester bushels of oats
per acre, in the month of April, and reap from 4 to 10 bolls,
in the month of September or October.  The third year,
the whole dung of the farm is applied as far as it will go, for
bear, of which they sow 4 bushels per acres and reap from 4
to 7 bolls.  Along with the bear, they low 3 bushels of
rye-grass feed, 8 lib. of red clover, and 5 or 6 lib, of white
clover.  The crop of hay is sometimes 200 stone, 24 lib. to
the stone, each acre; but more frequently does not exceed
100 stone.  It is usually cut for 2 years; then pastured for 4;
after which it is plowed for oats.

   Wages.-Men servants receive from 6 L. to 8 L. a year of
wages.  Women servants from 3 L. to 4 L. a year; but they
are commonly hired for half a year only.  A labourer re-
ceives a shilling a day; for mowing hay, 18 d.; a mason,
20 d.-The farmers plough with 4, or 3 horses with a dri-
ver, or with 2 horses without a driver, as they think the
nature of their soil requires; but most generally with 3 horses
and a driver.  The plough most in use is the Scotch plough,
with a curved mould board.-The price of all sorts of pro-
visions is fixed by the markets at Ayr.

   Wallacetown.-About 30 years ago, the late Sir Thomas
Wallace of Craigie began to seu houses and gardens from the
north end of the old bridge at Ayr.  At that time, there
were not above 8 or 10 straggling houses about the Bridge-
end; and now, in 1792, by a gradual increase, there are 250
families living in Wallacetown, so named after its founder.
