     OF Forglen

into the S. wall of it, is an inscription, in these terms:
This church was re-edisied by George Ogilvie, Master of
Banff, 1692.

     Situation and Extent.-Forglen lies on the N. side of
the river Diveron:  it is bounded on the W. by the parish
of Marnorch, on the S. by Turriff,  On the E. by Turriff
and Alvah, and on the N. by Alvah. On the S. and E.
side the river is the boundary.  Lord Bannff's lands, how-
ever, cross it in two or three different places. He has a
large alley opposite his own house, on the Turriff side;
another below the church, by the house of Muirish, and
a small part oppoasite Boat of Muirish.  On the N. boun-
dary, the part of the farm of Brownside, Captain Hay's,
called the Broadmyre, is n Forglen parish, and the rest
in Alvah.-The figure of the parish is an oblong, not
far from regular; only the N. E. angle is cut off by Al-
vah.  The lenght, from the church to the river side, to-
wards the S., is 3 1/2 English  miles, and the breadth 2 l miles.
It has a S. exposure, one of the best in the country.  The
lands have a gradual slope, from the back parts of the pa-
rist, to the river on the S.; and there are no high hills to
occasion any inconvenience of shade, being gentle rising
grounds, affording a beautiful variety.

     Soil.-The soil, on haugh grounds, is sandy, but pro-
duces very fine crops of grain, and very rich pasture.  The
soil on braes and flats above them is richer, and yields the
finest crops of barley and oats.  Having the river on two
sides, which acts as a drain, and there being little moss
or marshy ground in this parish, the harvest is early, and
the grain, in ordinary seasons, well filled and ripened.  It
is now cuslomary with merchants to buy oats and barley
