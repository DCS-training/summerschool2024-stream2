   1. To divide the larger farms when the leases have run,
and bring them into proper compass.  Evils are generally
corrected by their effects; and wise proprietors begin to dis-
cover, that small farmers make better payments than the
great, especially when they pay in produce.  It is beyond
doubt, that more corn was raised when farms were smaller
than at the present time.
   2. The introduction and patronage of manufactures
would not only prevent further depopulation, but would
give new life and spirit to agriculture, bring an increase of
people, by promoting and providing for marriage, and form
a solid and satisfactory basis for increasing rents.  If manu-

themselves.  A more timely attention to fisheries and ma-
nufactures, and particularly to the manufacturing of wool,
in the Highlands of Scotland, might have prevented the
emigrations to America, and even increased the sources of
public prosperity and national defence.  It is a speculation
equally mean and hazardous, to disposses brave and attach-

The maxim, that it is lawful for a man to do what he will

right of melting down the current coin; and more especial-
ly, in all feudal tenures, there are reserved rights of the
Sovereign, as head of the community, whereby proprietors
