runs the whole length of the parish; which, in this district,
is made of very durable materials, being land or whin
stones collected off the fields, beaten small, laid on to a great
thickness, and kept in excellent repair.  On every side
there is an easy descent, for the rain water to run into the
ditches, which are well scoured from time to time.  This
road from the Monkton road, till it reaches the middle length
of Symington, rises by a gradual ascent, and from thence
descends to Kilmarnock.  On the highest parts within the
parish, the traveller is presented with extensive, beautiful,
grand, and diversified prospects, consisting of the wide and
fertile plains of Kyle and Cunninghame, with their nume-
rous inclosures, belts, clumps of planting, and gentlemens
seats.  These most rich and delightful views are bounded
on the south, east, and north, by distant cloud-capp'd moun-
tains, and on the well by the frith of Clyde, in which are
seen the magnificent, and wave-surrounded rock of Ailfa,
the island of Arran, with its towering summits, and the
ships failing to and from Ayr, Irvine, Saltcoats, Greenock,
and Port-Glasgow.

   Water, Climate, and Diseases.-There are no rivers in the
parish, nor even a  stream, which deserves the name of a rivu-
let, but the inhabitants are generally supplied with excellent
water from open springs, or from sunk wells.  From the
quality of the soil, and the local situation of the parish, the
air is dry and salubrious.  The clouds which rise from the
Atlantic, being attracted by the distant hills on every side,
float in fogs on their summits; and, when they break into
rain, the greatest part of it falls on them.  Hence, the
inhabitants are remarkably healthful, and no local distem-
pers of any kind prevail among them.  Even when they
are visited by the natural small-pox, the disease is general-
ly more mild, than in the neighbouring parishes.  Inoculation
