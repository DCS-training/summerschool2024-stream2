their neighbours; and would in all seasons do so, did the
frost in August and September keep off.  By attention to
small binding and packing about wood, a rainy season does
not in the least alarm them.  To the mere habit of large
binding, and allowing corn to remain upon broad band for a

season, may, in a great measure, be ascribed the late scarcity
