     NUMBER XXII.

     PARISH OF WALLS AND FLOTA.

     (COUNTY OF ORKNEY AND SHETLAND-PRESBYTERY
     OF CAIRSLEY.-SYNOD OF ORKNEY).

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES BREMNER, Minister.

     Name.

   WALLS sometimes signifies the parish only, and some-
times it is taken for the whole island.  In old maps
it is spelt Waes, and its present pronunciation is uniformly as
if written Waas, corruption, probably, of Voes, which ori-
ginally, and at this day, signifies a considerable inlet or bay,
where ships anchor; and in these this end of the island
abounds, as Lyar-voe, Thur-voe, Osmand-voe.  Here it may
be remarked, as a thing not improbable, that Kirkwall, the
chief town of the county, was originally Kirk-voe.

   Population.-By an accurate list taken in 1788, the inha-
bitants of all ages, in both the united parishes of Walls and
Flota, stood thus:
