implements, to procure good horses and cattle, and to maintain
them in good order, though at present the low price of agricultural
produce prevents their realizing all the amendments in husbandry
of which the exceedingly rich soil of this parish is susceptible.
The roads have undergone wonderful improvements, having been
almost impassable in winter twenty-five years ago; but much still
remains to be done in this respect, the facilities of internal com-
munication being limited by the inadequacy of the commutation
funds for making and repairing roads. Many waste places have
been planted, and wood otherwise disposed for profit alike and or-
nament. The draining of the lake of Spynie, from which so much
was expected by the projectors, has ameliorated some portions of
land in this parish; but elsewhere has totally failed to fulfil the
golden hopes cherished regarding it. The building of Burghead
harbour has greatly enlarged that village, and increased the trade
and opulence of the parish and county, -the herring and salmon
fishery, and the extension of steam-navigation, adding also to this
increase. A very great change has taken place in this circumstan-
ces and manners of the people. They are now better fed and
better lodged, less superstitious in their ideas, and more refined in
their habits. Their houses and persons are more cleanly, and
their dress more expensive and tasteful. It may be doubtful, how-
ever, whether they are more temperate or upright. The very
amount of the poors' funds proves the increase of wealth, exhibiting
an advance from L. 15 to L. 56 per annum, and shews inter alia,
that this northern parish has not lagged far behind the rest of Scot-
land in her rapid march of improvement during last hall century.
