     Statistical Account

because of there they made peace, and other contracts of old,
They probably reckoned the matters here transacted, the more
solemn, too, that they believed the Sighichin, or Fairies,
supposed to dwell in those hills, to be witnesses of their tran-
sactions*. There hills were generally natural, but sometimes
artificial.  The Duni-pacis of Buchanan, (in English, Duni-
pace,) is a literal translation of Sioth-dhun.

   There is also another kind of steep green hill, in there
countries, and in Ireland, called Rath and Rata, from Rath,
and Roith, a wheel; because, being generally conical, at
least in part, their bases were round like a wheel, or circular.
Chieftains and great men had their houses frequently on the
tops of such; because they were difficult of access of all sides.
There gave names to many places, as, Rata-mhili (Vili) or
the Soldier's Rath of Rata, 4 miles above Dunkeld; Lagan-
rata, Logyraite; near which, one of our King Roberts had a
strong house, above the boat of Tummel.  Rothymurchus,
Rerath, Etc. are from the same root.

   Climate and Diseases.-The foil of these parishes would be
much more productive of corn, grass, and even wood, were
the climate but nearly proportionable to it.  But sometimes
the rains hurt the crops, especially in harvest.  Sometimes we
have snow too early, or too late; but, what is worst of all, we
have much cold, frosty weather, piercing northerly winds,
and blasting fogs and hoar-frosts, particularly along the rivers,
which either hurt the growth of vegetables, or destroy them
after they are grown up.  The coldness and sharpness of the
air, too, must, in some degree, stint the growth, and render
the faces of the people more thin and dry, than otherwise they
would be.

   The air, in general, is not remarkably moist or dry; nor
are the inhabitants greatly subject to any particular distem-
