within these 25 years, they never exceeded 600.  They now a-
mount to 830.  The increse is owing to the tenants having
use for more hands, being busied inclosing their farms, and
improving them with lime and marle.  There are likewise a
number of sinall possessions, which give great encouragement
to population.  There are no villages, nor any uninhabited
houses in the parish.  At an average for the last 10 years,
there have been 6 marriages, 20 baptisms, and 12 deaths
yearly.-There are only 3 heritors, none of whom
