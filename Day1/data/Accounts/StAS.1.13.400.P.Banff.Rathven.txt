to the amount of 38,900 cwt. which is given out to the
spinners at the average price of 1 s. the lb. and brings in
annually L. 1945.  A few tons of kelp are manufactured on
that part of the coast belonging to the proprietor of Buckie.

   Fisher-towns and Fisheries.-There are 4 fisher-towns in
the parish:  Buckie, Port-easy, Findochtie, and Port nockie.
The first belongs to two proprietors, and the 3 last to Lord
Findlater.

   1. Buckie, the most westerly of the fisher-towns, is situated
at the mouth of the rivulet or burn of Buckie.  Mr Baron
Gordon is proprietor of the lands and houses on the E. side
of the burn, and Mr Dunbar on the W.  On the W. side
there are 102 houses, and 400 inhabitants; of whom 175
are males, and 225 females: And on the E. side, 63 houses,
and 303 inhabitants; of whom 136 are males, and 167
females.  The W. side has been a fishing slation for 150
years, and is, according to my information, the oldest in the
parish.  The date of the other side as a fishing station, I
have not been able to ascertain.  In 1723, a fishing-boat
and crew belonging to the Duke of Gordon, removed from
Gollachie, which lies a mile westward, to Buckie, as being
a safer and more commodious station.  At that period the
proprietor of Nether Buckie, who held his lands in seu from
the Duke, had only one boat; and as he was out of the
kingdom, and in arrear to his Grace, the desired accommo-
dation was the more easily obtained.  At present, there are
14 boats and 1 yawl* employed in the fisheries.  The boats
are about 9 tons, and the yawl 4.  Of these, 3 boats and 1
yawl belong to his Grace, 3 to Mr Dunbar, and 8 to Mr Ba-
ron Gordon.  The merchants, and others of Buckie, are pro-
