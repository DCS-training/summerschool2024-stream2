   Disadvantages.-The greatest disadvantage this parish
labours under, is the difficulty and expense of procuring
fuel.  In general, peats are used.  These are only got on
the tops of the hills.  The steepness of the hills renders
the leading of them very troublesome.  If coals could be
got free of duty, very few peats would be made in the pa-
rish.  The heritors and principal tacksmen burn coals
chiefly.  The duty on water-born coals is a great grievance
to all Argyleshire, and a great bar to improvement.  There
is limestone in this parish, but the price of coals renders
the lime so dear, that, as yet, it is little used in agricul-
ture.  The above grievance is felt the more, that in the
neighbouring parishes of Lochgoilhead and Dunoon, they
get coals free of duty, being situated on the side of the
Clyde, and within the limits of the frith.

   Advantages.-The advantages of being so high the Clyde,
this parish enjoys in common with all the district Cowal;
butchers, from Greenock and glasgow, come to the seve-
ral farms to buy the cattle.  The farmers have easy access
to Greenock, where they have a ready market for what-
ever they have to dispose of, and where they can procure,
and easily get home, whatever they may want for the use
of their families.  The herring which frequent Lochfine,
are no doubt a great advantage to this district.  A clear
gain, amounting some years to L. 500 or L. 600 Sterling, a-
rises from that fishery.  But the fishing, especially when
succesful, has a great tendency to produce habits of idle-
ness among the people.  The method of catching herring
