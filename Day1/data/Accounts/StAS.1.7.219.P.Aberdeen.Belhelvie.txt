     of Belhelvie.

   Along the sea coast the soil is sandy, and free of rocks; a
little farther up it is a deep black mould or loam, and red
rich clay.  The west part of the parish is mossy, and wet in
some parts; and in other parts dry and rocky, and not so
much calculated for improvement as the east part.  There
are hardly any old trees in this district, except a few strag-
gling maples (acer pseudo platanus) and ashes, which have
been planted near the houses, of which the first seems to
bear the sea air best.  But there have been great forests of
wood in the mosses; and, even below the downs, the soil is
of a mossy nature, and has been full of wood.  The trees in
the mosses seem to have been all oak and allar, except some
fir found in the most westerly parts of the parish.  About
two miles from the sea the oaks have been most numerous,
and have grown to the largest size.  Near the sea there has
been little else but allar; and, though some of these trees
are found below the benty hillocks, yet they have been small
in comparison of those a little farther up.  The allars, in
general, are much decayed, but the oaks are found almost
quite found, buried under the mosses.  Some of the heritors
are making a few plantations, which are thriving, but require
much trouble, as will always be the case in an open country
exposed to the winds, especially when situated near the sea.

   Improvements.-Notwithstanding the advantageous situa-
tion of this parish on the sea coast, it has long lain in a state
of nature, owing to particular circumstances.  A great part
of the parish, under the name of the estate of Belhelvie, be-
longed to the Earl of Panmuir, being forfeited in 1715, was
purchased by the York-Building Company.  Short leases
were universally granted, and no improvements of conse-
quence took place.  If the tenant improved with lime, which
very seldom happened, he took care, when his lease was
