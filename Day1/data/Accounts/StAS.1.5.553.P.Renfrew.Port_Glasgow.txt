     of New Port-Glasgow.

Finlayston-Maxwell.-Before the year 1775, the city of
Glasgow, and the proprietor of the lands of Finlayston-
Maxwell, exercised the same jurisdiction over their respec-

the vacant places.  Of these trustees, two are bailies; the
one, called the oldest bailie, is chosen annually by the
Town-council of Glasgow, and the other, called the young-

   Revenue.-The public revenue of the town amounts to
about L. 500 Sterling a-year.  It arises chiefly from a tax
of L. 2 1/2 Sterling per cent. upon house rents; from another
tax of two pennies Scotch upon every pint of ale, either
brewed in the town or brought into it; from the rent of
