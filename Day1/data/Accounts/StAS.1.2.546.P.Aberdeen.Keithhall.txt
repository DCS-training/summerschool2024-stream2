nagement of the farms, and the general improvement of the
estate.

   How to meliorate the Condition of the People.-This might be
effected, by giving the tenants, (which is done in most of the im-
proved counties of Scotland,) an allowance of a year's rent for
the building of houses;-by granting them longer leases than
19 years, upon progressive rises of rent;-by lending them,
without interest, for 2 or 3 years, money to buy lime, the
tenants bringing it out themselves, and being bound to lay it
on turnip or fallow grounds;-by advancing one half of the
value of stone fences, the tenant paying only 5 per cent. of
interest, and either paying the other half, or what is general-
ly more than half the expence, laying down the materials;-
giving small premiums to the farmer, who has the best field
of turnips; and converting, where a farmer has a certain num-
ber of acres in fown grass, all the carriages and leet peats in-
to money;-encouraging meetings, where the farmers may o-
pen their minds, and communicate their plans to one another;
-encouraging day labourers, and discouraging all large crofts,
whose occupiers spend the summer in leading home more peats,
than would serve many day-labourers;-encouraging good
ploughmen, by small premiums:  and proportioning both the
rents and size of farms, better than they are at present.
