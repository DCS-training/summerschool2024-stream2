	Amount of Butcher-Meat, Bread and Milk, consumed in Glas-
gow.--As the office of Parliamentary Hide Inspector has lately been
abolished, the amount of butcher-meat consumed in Glasgow can-
not be ascertained with accuracy; we have therefore taken the
amount for 1822, from Dr Cleland's folio Statistical Work, when
the population was 147,043.

	Public Green.--There is probably no town of equal extent in
the empire which can boast of such a park as the Green of Glas-
gow, whether we consider its extent, its use to the inhabitants in
its walks, its wells, and its trees, or its picturesque effect on the
bank of a beautiful river. The sheep park at the bottom, and the
ride and drive of two and a-half miles, give an air of grandeur to
the whole. The Green contains 136 imperial acres, and there is
grass growing on it now, where grass never grew before. The pre-
sent state of this splendid park forms a great contrast with what it
was before its improvements were intrusted to Dr Cleland. Twen-
ty years ago, the surface of the Low Green was inundated by every
swell in the river. The Calton Green was separate from the
High Green by the Camlachie Burn, and the High Green from
Provost's Haugh by a deep gott or ditch, from which issued nume-
rous springs, all of which are now contained in spacious tunnels.
The Calton Green and the Haugh were so much destroyed by
powerful springs, that, even with the assistance of open destroyed by
Green was so soft, as frequently to prevent walking on it even in
the greatest drought, while in soft weather it was utterly impassable.

<FOOTNOTE>A Glasgow tron stone contained 16 lbs. 22 1/2 ounces. Meat is now sold by the
imperials stone of 14 lbs. of 16 ounces.
