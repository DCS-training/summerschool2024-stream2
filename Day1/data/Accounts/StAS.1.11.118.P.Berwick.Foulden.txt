of his breed of oxen were sold.  One ox weighed 128 stone,
and was of a very fine shape and make.

   Climate, River, etc.-This parish, and some other lands ad-
joining, stand upon a considerable elevation, which continues
to rise, towards the N., for 2 miles; and then slopes gradually,
until it reaches the sea banks, which are very high and rocky.
There is a river, called Whittadder, which runs on the S.
side, and empties itself into the Tweed, near Berwick.  The
bed of the river is very deep, being in no place under 40
yards, and in many places 50 yards, from the top of the bank.
These banks are cut, upon the N. side, into very deep dens
by nature, through which rivulets of water run, from the
whole lands in the neighbourhood, throughout the year.  These
circumstances, added to an almost unbounded prospect to the
S. and W., must contribute to render the air pure and dry,
and consequently less susceptible of noxious or infectious
taints.  It has been frequently remarked here, that the dis-
eases, which are peculiar to our climate, such as intermittent
and common continued fevers, putrid fever, and sore throat,
are scarce known amongst us, whilst they are sometimes very
frequent and mortal, in the parishes immediately adjoining.
These diseases have indeed made their appearance here at such
times, but unaccompanied with that malignity, which rendered
them so fatal to those attacked with them, in less elevated
and more moist situations.  For these 7 years and upwards,
only one young person has died, a female of 16 years of age,
and one child.  Good health is enjoyed through life, with
very little interruption; and, except these two, none have
died (residing in this parish), during the above mentioned
period, who had not reached at least 60 years; and it is not
unfrequent to attain the age of 80, and even 90 years, in the
full possession of every faculty.
