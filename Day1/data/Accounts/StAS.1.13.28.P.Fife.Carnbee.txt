year 178I to 1793, there have been only 27 births yearly.
This decrease of population is evidently to be ascribed to 
the two following causes.  The first is, that at present, the
whole lands in the parish, (excepting what some of the 
proprietors keep in their own hands), are let in tack to 32 
farmers; whereas, in the beginning of this century, they were

colliers, and other work-people in that line, who were wont 
to find constant employment here, found themselves under 
the necessity of going elsewhere for business, in the way to 
which they had been accustomed.

and ascend to the top of Kellie Law, which is about 800
feet above the level of the fea, and near three statute-miles

part of which is enclosed and subdivided, and in a high 
state of cultivation.  The small towns and royal boroughs
upon the coast, though far from being in so flourishing a 
state as before the Union, add greatly to the beauty and 
richness of the prospect; so does the range of towns on the
