bourers are paid 10s. per week in summer, and 9s. in winter; ma-
sons, 3s. to 3s. 6d. per day in summer, and 2s. 6d. to 3s. in winter;
carpenters are paid about the same wages as masons.
   Live-Stock.-From 300 to 400 cattle are purchased in autumn,
of which about 250 are fattened upon turnips during winter, and the
remainder are kept in the straw-yards through the winter, and fat-
tened upon the grass during the following summer. A few are rear-
ed in the parish, principally of the short-horned breed. Generally,
those purchased are of the north country breeds. About 1000 sheep
are fed during the season. There are about 300 pigs reared an-
nually, and chiefly sold to the fleshers in the neighbourhood, and
to the farm-servants. Many are sent to the London market.
   Manure, &c.-Lime as a manure has been of late years used
only to a very limited extent, the ground having been already ma-
nured with it. Rape-cake has been very much used, both for wheat
and turnip. Furrow draining, with tiles, is carried on to a consi-
derable extent in the parish, and almost always at the expense of
the tenant. The cost of draining, where the drains are put into
every furrow, at a depth of 30 inches, is about L. 7, 7s. an acre.
   Leases are always granted for 19 years.
   The offices on the different farms are generally in good repair.
The cottages for the farm-servants and labourers are, with few ex-
ceptions, too small, having only one apartment where all the family
must sit and sleep. This system is much to be deplored. The
bothy system has been introduced by some of the tenantry but
not with much success or general approbation. There are eight
steam-engines in the parish; seven are used in driving the machi-
nery of the thrashing-mills, the other engine is in the foundery at
North Berwick. Entails and the non-residence of proprietors are
among the great barriers to agricultural improvements.
   Produce.-The following is supposed to be the amount of pro-
duce raised annually in the parish.
