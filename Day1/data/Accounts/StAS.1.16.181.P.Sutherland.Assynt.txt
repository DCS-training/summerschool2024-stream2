sint is wintering, and consequently a temporary residence
of Lieutenant John Scobie.  He generally has a boat at
the western end of the beautiful fresh water lake called
Loch-Assint.  If it can be got, it will serve as a vehicle for
seven miles towards the higher farms here; and then the-
traveller lands near the parochial kirk; but though the
boat should not be procured, it makes no great differ-
ence; as upon leaving Little Assint, the traveller makes
for Tumore, where the road becomes perfectly firm, and
continues so, not only to Auld-an-na-kal-gach, the present
march, but as far further as the length of Dornoch or Train.
But to proceed and mention all the other farms of this inland
intermediate tract; the traveller leaving Turmore*, has the
high hills of Cu-i-nag close by him, to the north; on his

more, and of Ry-an-traid, Cul-nag-hills are attached to there farms; they
are managed by his overseers and servants here.  Himself and family reside
on the good corn farm of Scoury, Edrachilish parish.

   *Besides this tract or road from Inver to Tumole, there is another
from Oldeny to it also, at the distance of a half mile from Tumore, in
our way thence for the height, a path or track strikes off this principal
road (as we call it) by Ballach-lerag for Slishaebilish, particularly for
Gtenlerag, Ned, and Ardvare farms; the two former situated by the chops
of Loch-Ned, the latter not far from it.

   +Edra-chalda is the name of the farm; Baddy-na carbad is that of the-
wintering.
