his own property. Thus relief is given to all who are not provided
for out of the church door collections. The amount contributed
is L.150 yearly, and the number of poor thus relieved are 52.
   Fairs.--There are four fairs held annually in the parish. In
May there is a cattle fair at Kilmichael, and another on the next
day at Lochgilphead. In October the same take place; and, in
both May and October, these and the Inverary markets at the
same periods are so regulated that the cattle not sold at either of
the former may be driven to the latter. These fairs are not cor-
rectly inserted in the almanacks.
   Inns and Alehouses.--The number * of these in the parish is 30,
of which 23 are in the village of Lochgilphead. About 1400
gallons of whisky are sold in them quarterly; or about 5600
gallons yearly. The number of licensed houses is mischie-
vously great, and it is a most difficult matter to diminish them.
For though the justices are not unwilling to make abstract regu-
lations, yet, when it is a question wbether they ought to be en-
forced in any particular instance, difficulties in some way occur
and exceptions are made. There is, however, an improvement;
for, some years ago, when all the houses in Lochgilphead were
only 90, 32 or 34 of them were licensed to sell spirits, &c., while
now, though more houses have been built, the number licensed is
only 23.  This is still too great a proportion; and it is, moreover,
feared that the number selling without license is considerable.
Probably nine-tenths of the criminal business here has its origin
in whisky.
