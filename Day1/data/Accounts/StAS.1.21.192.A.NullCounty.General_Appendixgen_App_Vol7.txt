laying them on it.  So that I have now turnip, that would
sell for 10 L. per acre, growing where there was formerly an
impassable bog, not worth 1 s. per acre.
   `This last mode of draining is not precisely the same with
Mr. Elkinton's boreing, but it is near a kin to it, and has
proved as effectual, and has the merit of not being borrowed
from him, since it was practised before he was heard of in
this country.
   On a similar piece of ground, to the westward of the farm
houses, I have this year laid out a little Bleachfield, and erec-
ted a boiling house, where two of my daughters, carry on
a little manufacture of linen threads: which, however, as
well as the manufacturers, is yet too much in infancy to
afford ground for any opinion of its probable success.  It
has been contrived to bring the stream of water coming
from the westward through the middle of it; and it is in-

into the boiling house.
   `I have now in a great measure inclosed the face of the
hill rising south from Middletown, to the extent, as I guess,
of nearly an hundred acres, for planting trees, and have, I
think, already planted upwards of 100,000, consisting of
Scotch fir, pines, larix, oak, aller, birch, mountain ash, planes,
elms, etc. many of which are thriving exceedingly well,
though within less than a mile from the sea.  The oaks I
have chiefly raised by casting up small pits by a spade, and
putting in the acorn.  I raise a good many plants in the nur-

so many plants as would be necessary for so large an extent
of ground; I have contrived to sow the ground at once with
the fir and birch seeds, which I do in this manner:-I cause
one man go along the ground with a turnip hoe in his hand,
and by means of it scratch the ground at proper distance,
