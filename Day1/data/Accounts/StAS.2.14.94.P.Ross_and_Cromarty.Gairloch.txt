Of exotic trees for timber, there are none planted excepting
Larix, Pinus larix-Chestnut, Fagus castanea,-which thrive ex-
tremely well. A variety of delicate exotic shrubs bear this cli-
inate, and produce their flowers, in the grounds of Sir Francis
M,Kenzie. Trees in general grow rapidly in this moist climate,
whenever the soil and situation are suitable.

                        II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Eminent Men.-This parish has been as fortunate as most of
its neighbours, in being the birth-place and residerie-e of eminent
characters; but the only person whom I shall at present mention,
is William Ross, the celebrated Gaelic bard. This individual
was born in the parish of Stmtb, Isle of Skye, in the year 1762.
After receiving as liberal an education as the school of Forres, at
that time could afford, he was appointed parochial schoolmaster
of Gairloch, when about twenty-four years of age. In that situa-
tion, he continued four years. He died in his twetity-eighth year;
and his remains are deposited in the churchyard of Gairlocb.
As a writer of Gaelic sodgs," (to quote from a short memoir
prefixed to a Collection of his Songs, published four years ago,)
11 William Ross is entitled to.tbe highest praise. In the greater
number of his lyrics, the bard leads us along with him, and im-
parts to us so much of his own tenderness, feeling, and enthusiasm,
that our thoughts expand and kindle with his sentiments. Without
going beyond the bounds of I verhty and truth,' it may be affirmed
that his poetry, more perhaps tban-that of most writers, deserves
to be styled the poetry of the heart-of a heart overflowing with
noble sentiments, and with sublime and tender passions."
Lapd,owners.-Tbe land-owners of the parish are, Sir Francis
Alexander M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart.; Sir George Stewart
M,Kenzie of Coul, Bart.; Duncan Davison, Esq. of Tulloch;
James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq. of.Seaforth; and Hec-
tor M,Kenzie, Esq. of Letterewo.
