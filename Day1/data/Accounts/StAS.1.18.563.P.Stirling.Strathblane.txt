     Name.

   THE parish of Strathblane takes its name from the river
Blane, which rises in it, and runs through its whole
extent.  Blane is a contraction of two Gaelic words, signify-
ing warm river.  The literal interpretation of the word
Strathblane, consequently is, "the valley of the warm river;"
a name fitly appropriated to this parish, which from its situa-
tion, enjoys a peculiarly mild atmosphere.  Lying on the
south side of the Lennox hills, it is sheltered by them from
the inclement winds of the north; while the reflection of the
sun's rays from a light sandy soil, produces an agreeable tem-

   Situation, Boundaries, etc.-Strathblane is situated in the
northwest corner of Stirlingshire, and lies withing the bounds

belongs to the presbytery of Dumbarton, and synod of Glasgow
and Ayr.  It is bounded on the east, by the parish of Camp-
