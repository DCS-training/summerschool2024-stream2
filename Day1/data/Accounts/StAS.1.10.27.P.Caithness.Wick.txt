rounded by a burial place, still in use.  There was another at
Saint Ereskirk, a little below Ackergill Tower, respecting
which, it is handed down by tradition, that some centuries
ago, the Clan-Gun surrounded the chapel, when the people
in the neighbourhood were met for worship, and slaughtered
many of them in cold blood.  Between the Guns, who in

town of Wick, kept under good regulations by the Magistrates.
In cheap, years, beef has been fold at I d. or 1 1/2 d. per lib.; but
when cattle is dear, and the demand high, it has got up to 2 d.
and 2 1/2 d. and in spring, when scarcest, to 3 d. Pork and mutton
fetch much the same price.  The meat here is supposed to be
more tender and delicious, than the rougher grained animal food
of England, or that of the southern parts of Scotland.  Caithness
is noted for rearing geese, which furnish a luxurious repast, when
fattenned on the stubbles after harvest.  Sometimes they are
hung up and smoaked.  Some turkeys and ducks are raised.  Hens
fetch from 3 d to 4 d cocks 2 1/2 d. chickens 1 d. and 1 1/2 d. each,
and eggs sell at 1 d. per dozen.  Of meal and bear, there is in gene-
ral not only a superabundance, but a considerable export.  There
is enough of malt, and too much whiskey, which is prejudicial
to the morals and constitutions of many.  Butter and cheese are
sold at from 10 s. to 12 s. per double stone of 24 lib. weight,
Tallow at much the same rate.  The difference in the prices of
provisions of all kinds, is very considerable in the course of the
last 20, 30, or 40 years; a leg of beef, weighing between 50 or
60 lib. could have been bought for 2 s. 6 d. 3 s. or 4 s. which
now will fetch from 10 s. to 18 s. according to the weight and
quality; and porks, muton, and veal, have risen in the fame
proportion.  Geese that of old fold at 4 d. 6 d. and 8 d. now
draw 1 s. in summer, 1 s. 3 d. after harvest, and 1 s. 6 d. at Mar-
tinmas.  Tallow, butter, and cheese that formerly fold at 41 or
5 L. Scotch, the double stone, now fetch from 14 L. to 15 L. and
16 L. Scotch.  In like manner, visual, that 30 years ago sold at;
5 s. 6 s. 7 s. or 8 s. now fetches from 10 s. (the usual convert-
ed price of the boll in Caithness,) to 12 s. 14 s. 15 s. 16 s. 18 s.
and for crop 1782, which had in general sailed, no less than 20 s.
per boll.
