advantageous to landholders and to the community.  It is in
conformity with such an improved system of management that
the agriculture of this parish is now conducted, and by a judi-
cious and respectable tenantry.  There are about 400 milch cows
and 550 young cattle in the parish, besides the sheep, and from
these and the crop lands must be made up the proportion of the
rent.  That part of the rent which is paid from sheep is very
handsome, but the tenants are provided with suitable accommoda-
tions; and by means of skill and capital, with lands of a sound qua-
lity, and flocks of an established character, they are enabled to
pay large rents, to employ many servants and artisans, and thus
to divide, with their landholders and with the community, the be-
nefits of their farming industry.
    Produce.--It is the common rule, that the gross returns from
farms in general ought to rise to about three times the rents; and
this proportion holds in general as to arable and cattle farms; but
the whole gross returns of this parish do not much exceed twice
the rental, and this arises from the greater part being under sheep.
