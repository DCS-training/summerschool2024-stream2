veral years before.  There cottages, however, are all 
hired for the year, and do not work by the day, or by the 
piece.  With regard to the country in general, no doubt 
the effect of employing cottagers will be to increase popu-
lation, particularly the number of labouring servants; and 
in consequence of this, their wages will be kept more mo-
derate, and the farmer will more easily procure such un-
married servants as he may with to have.  The other me-

   There are two alehouses upon the public road, and
chiefly supported by travellers, and by the fishers, during 
the time of the salmon fishing.  In general, the morals of 
the people can hardly be said to suffer from them.  At the 
same time, it must be acknowledged, that they give more 
easy and frequent opportunuities of tippling to those who
are addicted to that vice.
