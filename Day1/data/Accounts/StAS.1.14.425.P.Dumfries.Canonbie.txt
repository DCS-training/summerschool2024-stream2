     Of Canoby.

Many have fixed their residence here, who are not na-
tives; several of whom are from England.

   Inhabited Houses, Number of Acres, Stock, etc.-There are
about 512 houses inhabited, containing, at an average,
somewhat more than 5 inhabitants each.  None are unin-
habited.  Within these 20 years, 180 new dwelling houses,
at least, have been reared; 53 of which are covered with
blue Slates; besides office houses, which are also generally
slated.

   The parish has been measured, and contains 22,500
and odd acres; of this number, perhaps 15,000 or 16,000
acres are arable, or may be made capable of tillage; but
as yet not more than 9000 or 10,000 are in the way of 
being under the operation of the plough: although it is
to be lieped, from the progressing state of improvement
in this parish, that the whole of the improvable ground
will, in due time, be made to change its natural state.
All the land is occupied in crop, pasture, or wood; and
the greatest part is enclosed and fenced by hedges, or stone
walls, the advantages of which are fully recognised.  As
the whole farms in the parish have been let upon a plan
of improvement, and therefore upon very reasonable terms;
the present land rent, as estimated by the ratio of poor's
rates, does not much exceed 30001.  What revenue may
arise from the coal and lime works, or the fale of oak
bark and wood, cannot be accurately slated.
   The number of horses in the parish is about 407; of
black cattle 1516; of sheep, it is supported, between 2000
and 3000; and of swine 259.  The writer has been in-
formed, that, about 60 years ago, there were only 2 carts
in the parish: at present, there are 217; 2 waggons, and
