of this class of society, an asylum in the House of Refuge will be
found for those in more advanced years,--where moral and religious
instruction will be communicated, and mechanical trades learned,
by which, with the fostering care of the managers, while in the asy-
lum, and after they leave it, they may become useful members of
society.
	Police.--Till the appointment of a statutory police in 1800, the
citizens of Glasgow performed the duties of watching and ward-
ing. The buildings in Albion Street are very extensive, and were
the first in Scotland erected for the exclusive purpose of police.
	Of the concerns of the establishment, which is placed under the
management of the magistrates, and one commissioner for each of
35 wards chosen by the rate payers, the following is an abstract
for 1834: Disbursements L. 15,033, 13s. 6 1/2d. The receipts arise
from 1s. per pound on rents exceeding L. 15, and on lower rents
less, proportionally. Besides the superintendent, collector, clerk,
surveyor, and surgeon, there are 8 heads of departments, 3 lieute-
nants, 58 officers, 135 nigh-watchmen, 8 coal weighers, 21 lamp-
lighters, 50 firemen, and 20 supernumeraries; in all 308 persons
on the establishment. There are 2050 gas lamps with single jets,
and 47 with 3 jets; in all 2097 lamps. Of this number between
800 and 900 are taken down in the summer months.
	Bridges.--Bridges are a sort of edifices very difficult to execute,
on account of the inconvenience of laying foundations, and wall-
ing under water. There are three stone bridges, and one timber
bridge over the Clyde at Glasgow, exclusive of Rutherglen stone
bridge at Barrowfield in the Barony parish.
	The original timber bridge over the Clyde having gone into de-
cay about the year 1340, Bishop Rae built a stone bridge at
Stockwell Street in 1345. The bridge was originally twelve feet
wide, and consisted of eight arches. In 1777 an addition of ten
feet was made to its breadth, and two of the northmost arches,
built up for the purpose of confining the river within narrower
bounds. The communication between the city and the south-
west parts of Scotland for more than 400 years was by this bridge.
In 1820-21, it was greatly improved by the formation of footpaths,
suspended on very tasteful iron framings. The bridge as it now
stands is 415 feet long, and 34 wide within the railing.
	The foundation stone of the Jamaica Street Bridge was laid on
the 29th of September 1768, by the Right Worshipful Provost
George Murdoch, acting provincial grand master mason for Glasgow.
