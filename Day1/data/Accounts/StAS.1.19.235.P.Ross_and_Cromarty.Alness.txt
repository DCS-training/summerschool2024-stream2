form; in some parts not above two miles, and in others
more than four miles broad.  It is 12 miles long, extending
from Alness point, on the shore of the frith of Cromarty,
its south-east boundary, a considerable way into the more
highland parts of the country.  In the lower part of the
parish, lying contiguous to the sea, and about two miles up-
wards, the ground is mostly arable, and of various qualities.
The soil, however, is generally light, and though it seldom
produces luxuriant crops, yet when the farmers are indus-
trious, their labour is rewarded by a middling return of
oats, barley, and pease, and abundant crops of potatoes;
and there can be little doubt, if the farms, which are almost
all open-field, were inclosed, and a different mode of farm-

the country, but the soil would produce at least a third
more grain than it does at present.  The higher parts of
the parish, lying beyond a ridge of hills which conceals
them from the eye of the traveller on the public road, con-

but chiefly adapted for pasturage, and in which a consider-
able number of black cattle, and some small horses, are
reared.  Adjoining to these straths are two beautiful fresh-
water lochs or lakes, which have a pleasant effect to the
eye, and abound with a variety of trout.  Each loch is
about two miles long, and nearly a mile broad.  Higher up
the country, and beyond these lochs, is a very extensive
tract of rich heath, affording pasture in the summer time,
not only to the graziers in the braes, but for the oxen and
young store of the farmers in the lower part of the parish
and neighbourhood, who, not having sufficient pasture of
their own, must send their cattle to feed for the summer
months to these grazings.
   Sheep-farming has been lately introduced on these higher
grounds, extended heaths, and some of the glens; but the
