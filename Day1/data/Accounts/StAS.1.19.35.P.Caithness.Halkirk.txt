usually yield so much milk as might be expected; why
that cattle are in general more poor, and of less size than
they might have been; and consequently, why they fetch
such low prices at markets.  But what is their motive for
this unfrugal and mistaken plan?  Why, because the com-
merce in that cattle is a principal and necessary article of
credit; and consequently, they calculate their stock, ac-

Besides, having no other way so ready to maintain credit,

another plan, and kept an adequate number of cattle only,
their families would be better supported, their cattle better
in quality and value, and the demands of the landlord
more readily answered.

grows less and less.  This failure may be attributed to se-
veral causes; to the wetness and swampiness of the soil; to
their being fed promiscuously with other cattle; to their
being, for the most part, housed every night, and often
with other cattle; to the want of due skill and care in ma-
