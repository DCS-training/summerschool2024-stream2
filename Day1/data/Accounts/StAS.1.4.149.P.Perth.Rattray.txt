few individuals excepted) are not effected by them.  As
the air is pure, and the soil dry, the inhabitants are heal-
thy; no epidemical distemper is known.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants, according to
Dr Webster, was 751.  at present, 500;  which is con-
siderably less than when I knew the parish in 1756.  There
were then many more small tenants than there is now.  The
ground was let out in small farms or pendicles, and many
who had these, were weavers;  but of late, some of the 
proprietors have let their ground in larger farms, and many
of these small tenants have been removed.  The annual
number of marriages, is 10; baptisms, 20 and deaths, 20.
In the parish are upwards of 42 weavers, 22 of them in
the village;  16 feuers.  In the village 6 tailors, 5 shoe-
makers, 4 wrights, 2 smiths, 2 masons, 3 flax-dressers,
about 60 Seceders, 3 lint mills for dressing flax, a consider-
able quantity of which is raised, (one of these mills is soon
to be turned into a mill for spinning cotton), 3 bleachfields,
2 distilleries.

   Church, Stipend, School, etc.-The church and manse
are old, and not in good repair.  the glebe nearly 6 a-
cres. The stipend L. 65.  Earl of Kinnoul, patron.  There
are 5 heritors.  The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 8, 6 s.
8 d. and the perquisites amount nearly to the same sum;
the number of scholars about 40.

   Ruins.-To the S.E. of the village, there is a rising
ground, known by the name of the Castle Hill, upon
which the vestiges of a very large building are to be seen,
which was called the Castle of Rattray, and was the resi-
dence of the family of Rattrays, of great antiquity, accord-
ing to the accounting given in the Baronage of Scotland.
