whom are heads of families, and receive a weekly allow-
ance.  Besides collections in the church on the Sundays,
there is a considerable fund belonging to the poor, the in-
terest of which, together with the weekly collections, is
sufficient for every purpose of parochial charity.  In the
year 1782, the year in which the present incumbent was
ordained, it does not appear that the number of poor in-
creased, and the only difference between that and other
years, seems to have been a more liberal disbursement to
such as were already upon the roll.

   Manners, etc.-Plainness of manners and honesty in their-
dealings, characterize the inhabitants of this district.  In
their several occupations they are industrious, and at the
same time carry on their business without notice and without
seuds.  Many of them are in easy circumstances, and all
live within their income.  Their stature is about the mid-
dle size; their food plain, and they possess all the spirit and
activity of Highlanders.  In profession they are Presbyte-
rians, and well attached to the family on the throne.  If
their zeal is temperate, it is not the less real; want of enthu-
siasm being no proof of indifference, but, on the contrary, of
soundness in principle.  Whether the parish has produced
any eminent men, either in science or in arms, is uncertain;
it is said, however, to have given birth to a famous actress
on the English stage.
