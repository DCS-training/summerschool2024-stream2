   Climate.-The climate in this district is rather damp, owing to
constant falls of rain, which are noticed above; but at the same
time that it is damp, it is also mild.  The winter months are ge-
nerally soft and mild, without much snow, except on the high
grounds; but there are continued deluges of sleet and rain.  The
climate being so damp has the effect of producing rheumatisms,
colds, and influenzas, which may be called the prevailing com-
plaints of the parish.
   Hrydrography.-The Coe (Fingalian Cona) and the Creran are
the principal rivers,-the former running through Glencoe, and
discharging itself into Lochlaven at Invercoe, the residence of Mr
Macdonald of Glencoe; and the latter, running through Glencre-
ran, receives the Ure and other tributary streams in its progress,
and empties itself into the head of Lochcreran below Druimvick,
the residence of Donald Campbell, Esq. of Baileveolan.  On
each of these rivers, there is excellent salmon fishing.
   Next to these in importance are, the river of Coinich, in Kin-
gairloch, with those of Duror, Laroch, and Laven, and in each of
these there is salmon and fine trout in season.  The parish
abounds with beautiful perennial springs.  The springs in Lis-
more are so numerous, that no country is better supplied
with this important necessary of life.  The island is all on
limestone, and the rock is full of fissure and subterranean
passages that serve as so many reservoirs, which discharge their
