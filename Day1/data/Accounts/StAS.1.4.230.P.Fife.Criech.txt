try seraglio.  It is defended on one side, by a morass; and
on the other side, has had strong outworks.  Being much
defaced, and some of the finest stones removed, no inscrip-
tion can be found to mark its date.  There were lately
found, in a rising spot of ground near the manse, 2 brown
jars, with their bottoms upwards, and a broad stone laid
on each, containing human bones.  The bones were much
consumed, yet joints, etc. were discernible.  It must have
been long since they were put there, as burning or in-urning
the dead, is not a late practice in this country.

   Thunder.-About 18 or 20 years ago, the lightning
struck Pitcullo house, about 4 miles north of Cupar.  It

where was a mahogany table.  This table was picked, as
if hit with very small shot.  Here its force was exhausted.-
Thunder broke within a mile of the manse in summer 1789,
in a low-lying field of oats.  It laid flat the corn for about
15 or 16 yards in length, and 7 or 8 in breadth.  The
straw what was before green, and full of sap, became yel-
low and withered.  The earth on the spot was ploughed
up, though not deep.  This field, though lying so low, is 
near the Tay, and water is an attractor.-Four or 5 years
ago, a tremendous slash, accompanied with a dreadful peal
of thunder, killed 2 tradesmen at Cupar.  They were fit-
