reverse of beneficial to their members. The money is generally,
deposited in the hands of grocers and spirit-dealers, who, besides
exacting the highest price for goods supplied on the credit of de-
posits, offer a strong temptation to excess, by supplying, on trust,
the means of intoxication when the individual's money may have
run sbort. A Clothing Society exists under the patronage of a
number of benevolent ladies connected with the parish: and a
soup-kitchen has for several years been established during the
winter.
   Savings Bank.--A Savings Bank was instituted in 1815, and al-
though the labouring classes, partly from ignorance, partly from
improvidence, do not avail themselves to so great an extent as is
desirable of the advantages which it offers them, yet it has upon
the whole been attended with success, and has conferred great be-
nefits upon such as had prudence and foresight enough to deposit
a part ot their earnings. Since its commencement the total
number of depositors has been 1275, the amount of sums depo-
sited, L. 22,246, 18s. 11d. During the last year 30 depositors
have been paid up, 42 new depositors have opened accounts,
and there are altogether 195 open accounts with the establish-

   The Western Bank and the Commercial Bank of Edinburgh
have each a branch established here.

an expense of L. 139, 9s. 7 1/2d. per annum.  There is distributed
to occasional poor between L. 3 and L. 4. Fifty poor children are
educated at the expense of the parish; that expense amounts year-
ly to L. 26, 16s. 7d.
