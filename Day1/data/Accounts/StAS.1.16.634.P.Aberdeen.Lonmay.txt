     Statistical Account

   Minerals.-No marble, freestone, or slate, and not much
moorstone, are found in this parish.  But a blue stone has
been quarried on the estate of Cairness, belonging to Mr
Gordon of Buthlaw.  This, contrary to the nature of the
blue stone commonly found in Aberdeenshire, cuts as well
as granite, and makes beautiful ashler work.  Of this stone,
Mr Gordon has lately built an elegant modern house, on a
plan given by Mr Playfair.
   No coal mines are found in this parish; but limestone is
found in great quantities on the estate of Craigellie, about
2 English miles from the church, and is much used for ma-
nure.

sides horses, sheep, hogs, black cattle, dogs, and cats, are
moles in great numbers, foxes seen sometimes, otters in the
lake of Strathbeg, observed but seldom, polecats, weasels,
common and shrew-mice, hares, rats, and water-rats.
