Where this parish is divided from that of Nairn, there is a 
stone about 6 feet high and 3 broad:  This stone in the 
Gaelic language obtains the name of claoch na cabbac; in
the English, or rather Scotch, "cabbac stone."  Cabbac or
cabback, signifies a cheese.  The report of tradition is,
that it was erected there over a chieftain who fell in a 
scuttle which originated about a cheese, in the town of 
Inverness; the death of one of the chiefs put an end to
the battle, where the stone is erected.  This story is told
by the oldest people in the country, and obtains credit.
