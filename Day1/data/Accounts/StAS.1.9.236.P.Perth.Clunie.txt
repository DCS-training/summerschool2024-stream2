up by the grey-hawk or the squirrel, so that its whole race
seems now to be exterminated from this parish and neigh-
bourhood.  The wild quadrupeds here are also numerous.
We have the urchin or hedge-hog, the weazel, the pole-cat,
the wild-cat, the badger, the fox, the rabbit, the hare, the
otter, etc.  The common brown squirrel begins to breed
in the woods; it was also introduced at Dunkeld by the
late Duke of Athole, and has unfortunately done much harm
to the singing birds.  A few roes haunt the park of Laigh-
wood; and, in distressing winters, the red deer appear in
the forest of Clunie, and in the higher parts of the district.

   Plants.-Here the botanical will find but few of the rarer
indigenous plants: If, however, pleasure or curiosity should
lead him this way in July or August, he may take a morn-
ing sail on the loch of Clunie; while he steers his barge
slowly by "those deep beds of whispering reeds," that in
some places, grow so thick as to seem almost impervious, he
will observe, among other water-plants, the lobelia-dort-
manna, for which the Stormont lochs are remarkable.
He will also find the bullrush, the equisotum fluriatile (wa-
ter horse tail), the surpus, (rush-grass), and a variety of the
potamogiton, (pond weed): But his eye will be charmed by
the luxuriant appearance of the nymphaea lutea and alba,
(white and yellow water lilly), blended together over the sur-
face of the water, and arrayed in a splendor superior to "So-
lomon's in all his glory*."  Having passed the calm funny
morning among these his aquatic companions, the admirer
of vegetable nature may betake himself to the adjoining
manse, and there breakfast with an humble country clergy-
man on tea, bread and butter and water-cresses.  After
