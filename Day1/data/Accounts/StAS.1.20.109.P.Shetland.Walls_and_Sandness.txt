is the patron.-The present incumbent was admitted mi-
nister in Apri1 1787.  His predecessors were Messrs Tho-
mas Henry, Laurence Umphray, William Umphray, James
Ogilvy, George Duncan, James Buchan, who held his of-
fice 43 years.  John Inches, who was translated to Nesting,
in this presbytery, and was succeeded by the present incum-
bent.-The church of Walls was built in 1746, and is ve-
ry commodious, and well finished in the seating, being all
pannelled work.  The church of Sandness was built in 1792,
in which year also the church of Papa has been repaired,
but still very incomplete.  The manse was built in 1780,
and is neat and well finished.

   Poor.-There are a good many poor in the ministry, who
receive assistance from the poor-funds, and who are stationed
at the same time in their several districts, a certain number
of families being assigned them for their maintenance.  They
get money from the box to purchase clothes and shoes; and,
if the families among whom they are placed fail in grant-
ing supplies, meal is likewise procured for them.  Redu-
ced families, who cannot be stationed upon the public, re-
ceive from the poor-funds as they can afford.  The people
are disposed in general to be humane and charitable.  The
weekly and sacramental collections are the only fund for sup-
plying the poor; the latter of which are pretty liberal for
a people who are in mean circumstances, and among whom
money is scarce.  They amount yearly to about L. 9 or L. 10
Sterling; and as good is sometimes educed from evil, the
fines which arise from those who transgress the rules of the
church, contribute likewise to the supply of the poor.  The
exact amount of the funds cannot be well known.
