                   GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

               ON THE COUNTY OF CAITHNESS.

CAITHNESS is the must northern county on the mainland of
Scotland. It is divided from the county of SutberlaDd'by a range
of mountains and moory hills, extending from the Ord of Caith-
ness to the North Sea, and is bounded otherwise by the sea; the
Pentland Frith dividing iffrom the Isles of Orkney. It extends
from north to south about 40 miles, and from east to west about
30 miles. Its area is 618 square miles, or 395,680 acres, of
which about 100,000 are cultivated and in pasture, and the rest
are u neultivated moor and hills. The valued rent is L. 39,256
Scots, and the real value of -the lapd may now be L. 35,000 Ster-
ling. The population in 1831 w`s 36,529. The Parliamentary.
constituency in 1840 was 487.
Topography.-T he general appearanceof the county is flat and
uninteresting; the only bill's of any eminence forming the boun-
dary with Sutherland. A great proportion of the ground consist-
ing of flat moor and heath, and there being no extent of trees, the
interior has a dreary appearance. Along the sea coast, which is
generally bold and rocky, the appearance improves; and, from
the improvements Dow going on in various quarters, a more cheer-
ful and pleasant aspect is given to it, especially along the high
road from the south towards Thurso. There are a few sheets
of water, but none of any extent or peculiar beauty of appearance,
and there are no navigable rivers.
Geology.-There is no coal formation so far as known. Sand-
stone of good quality prevails in some places; but the general,
formation is a black, bituminous, slaty sandstone. Mr Traill of
