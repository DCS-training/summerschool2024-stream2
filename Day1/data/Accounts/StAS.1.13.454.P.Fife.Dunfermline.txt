Malcolm Canmore.  In its structure it is said to resemble
the cathedral at Durham.  It is very capacious, and fit
for containing so numerous an auditory, as few ordina-
ry voices can reach, so as to be distinctly heard; suscep-
tible of much improvement, and of being made, if not a
neat and confortable, at least a dignified looking place of 
worship.  It is much to be regretted, that far from any at-

very little attention has been paid to have it seated, and
sitted up with becoming decency; the whole is cold and
dirty, and wears rather a gloomy appearance.  A stranger
may well be surprised, to find the church of a town so po-

appearance, so miserably fitted up within.  This may be 
accounted for, from the church having never been legally
divided among the heritors, the non-resdence of some of
the most considerable property, and several of them being 
of the Secession principles; from the inattention of the
town-council, and from the dispositon very prevalent a-
mong heritors, to be at as little expense as possible, in what
regards either churches, or those who officiate in them.
To these causes may be added the want of the interference
of some spirited and generous individual, from whole ex- 
ertions, improvements in general are often found to ori-

the church of Dunfermline became the common cemete-
ry of the kings of Scotland.  Here Malcolm Canmore, and
his Queen St Margaret, and other 7 of our Scottish kings
were interred*.  The reader, fond of antiquities, might
