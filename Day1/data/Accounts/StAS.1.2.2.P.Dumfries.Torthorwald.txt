rises in high black hills; one, called the Beacon hill, affords
perhaps the most extensive view, round the horizon, of any
rising ground in this part of the country, Crissel excepted.
There are about 4400 acres, including 900 of moss, in the
parish; the inhabited part of which, with the exception of a
few scattered families, is a square of 2 3/4 miles, in the middle
of which stand the castle, the manse, and the church.

   River and Moss.-The river Lochar, which, for 7 miles,
divides this parish from that of Dumfries, is about 25 feet
broad at a medium; and so much on a level, in its course through
Lochar Moss, that it has a descent of only 11 feet in that space,
which measures 12 miles in a direct line.  It contains pike,
perch, trout, and eel; some of the pike weigh 20 lbs. some
eels 3 lbs. and a few of the trout 5 lbs.  Several otters fre-
quent this river, and make great havock among the pike.
Wild duck and teal abound here all the year round, and
many wild geese visit this place in stormy winters.  A few
swans also come hither, and several bitterns and herons.  In
the adjacent moss and meadows, curfews, plovers, and moor-
fowl breed.  Lochar moss*, it is well known, is a tract of 12
miles in length, and betwixt 2 and 3 in breadth, extending down
to Solway first.  That this moss was once an arm of the sea,
appears from several circumstances:  Sea-sand and sleech are
found at the bottom; and sometimes boats, almost entire, with
anchors, cables, and oars.  Tinwald isles, at the N. W. extre-
mity of the parish, are said, in a Spanish history, to have been
the best harbour in Scotland; and Dumfries, which lies at the
back of the moss, has been translated by Latin historians, Dor-
sum freti, the back of the first. There is a saying common
here, that this tract was,
     "First a wood, and next a sea,
     "Now a moss, and ever will be."
