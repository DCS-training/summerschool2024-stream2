teach Latin. Under fifteen years of age, there are very few, if any,
who cannot read and write. Above fifteen years of age, there may
be a few who cannot write, but none who cannot read.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of poor upon the
roll in this parish is 17; many of them live in their own houses,
and generally receive from 12s. to L. 1 per quarter; some receive
less. This small allowance is granted only as an help to their in-
dustry, not as an encouragement to sloth and idleness. There is
not one beggar within the limits of these parishes. Occasional sup-
les are, besides, granted to other families, who by sickness and
misfortunes are reduced to necessitous circumstances. The mo-
ney annually expended on the poor of these parishes amounts to
nearly L. 80. There is certainly a disposition among the poor to
refrain from seeking parochial relief, as they seem to consider it
degrading.
   Friendly Society.-A friendly society was established in this pa-
rish at the beginning of the present year, for the purpose of afford-
ing relief to the sick.
   There is also another society in the parish called the Garvald
Friendly Society, instituted in 1819, for the laudable purpose of
raising a fund to relieve the distress of any member in the event
of his cow dying. Each cow is insured to the amount of L. 10
Sterling.
