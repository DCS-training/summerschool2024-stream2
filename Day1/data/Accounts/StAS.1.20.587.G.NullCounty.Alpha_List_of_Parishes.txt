<FOOTNOTE>

*Although, in some instances, the same parish lies in two or three diffe-
rent counties, it was judge expedient, in the following Table, to slate the
total population of all parishes in that situation under only one of the
counties to which they respective belong, as no distinction was made in
the returns.  It is also to be observed, that where the population of pa-
rishes in the following Table differs from that in the Statistical Returns,
it was occasioned by corrected statements of the number of inhabitants ha-
ving been received subsequent to the publication of the account of each
such parish.
