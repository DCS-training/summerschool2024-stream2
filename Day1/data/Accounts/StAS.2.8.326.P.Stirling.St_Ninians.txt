   By the recent census, the population of this parish amounts to
10,234-inerease from 1831, 684. Of these, however, more than
2000, including the village of St Ninians itself, are comprehend-
ed in the Parliamentary burgh of Stirling, so that we cannot enter
into the same minute detail as at the former enumeration.

   Agriculture.--From the great variety of soil and climate, the
agriculture of this parish cannot be comprehended under one ge-
neral description. The moorlands are most profitably employed'
in grazing. The highest and bleakest parts are allotted to sheep,
of which nearly 4000 are kept. Upwards of 1000 black-cattle
are annually fed, either along with the sheep, or in lower regions
where the grass has supplanted the heath. Along the banks of
the Carron, and as you descend to the dryfield, much attention
is paid by the farmers to the dairy. Several hundred cows are
kept, and excellent butter and cheese are brought to market.
Each farmer aims to raise as much grain as may serve his own
family, though, in unfavourable seasons, he is often disappointed.
Traces of the plouoh, as has often been observed elsewhere, are
to be met with in our moorlands, where, for many years, perhaps
ages, no grain has been raised.
   On, the sloping grounds, particularly of Sauchie and Touch, a
number of grass parks are annually let. Some of Saucbie parks
have been let as high as L. 6 per acre, though the rent, of course,
varies from year to year, and also according to the quality of the
grass.
   In the Dryfield there is much excellent land well cultivated,
interspersed, however, with barren ridges, and tracts of cold, thin,
damp soil. The improved culture of much of this part of the
parish is but of recent date. In the memory of persons not far
advanced in life, a large district, stretching to the Torwood, was
