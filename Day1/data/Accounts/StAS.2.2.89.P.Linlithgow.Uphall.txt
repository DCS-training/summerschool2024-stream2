   In a list of ecclesiastical persons who held lands in Scotland
anno 1296, and preserved in the Tower of London, we find the
name of "Ferquardus parsona ecclesiae de Strathbroke vicecomi-
tatu de Linlidgo."
   The present stipend is sixteen chalders of victual, amounting in-
value, according to the fiars of crop 1840, to L. 265. But there
are unexhausted teinds to the value of nearly L. 400. The
glebe contains ten Scotch acres, which-may be valued at L. 25.
There is, properly speaking, no manse at present. But in place
thereof, the minister possesses an excellent mansion-house, be-
longing to the Earl of Buchan, delightfully and conveniently situ-
ated, for which the other heritors pay their proportion of rent.
   Schools,-There are two schools. The parochial school is at
the village of Broxburn. About 100 scholars attend. The
other school is at the village of Uphall. It is attended by 80
scholars. No additional school seems necessary. The parochial
schoolmaster's salary is L. 34, 4s. 4 1/2d.; school fees amount to
L. 36 or thereabouts; and other emoluments to about L. 15; the
sum of L. 1, 12s. is allowed him by the heritors for a deficiency of
garden.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-Particular attention is paid to the
support and comfort of the poor. The average number regularly
receiving parochial aid is about 20; several get occasional relief
besides. The weekly collections in the church average about L. 16
a-year; property for behoof of the poor, invested in the kirk-ses-
sion, yields L. 40 a-year; and to make up the deficiency of what
is requisite, the heritors voluntarily assess themselves. The as-
sessment is L. 30 or upwards varying as circumstances require.
