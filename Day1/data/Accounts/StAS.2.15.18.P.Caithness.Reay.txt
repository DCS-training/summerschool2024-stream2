Language,&c.-The Gaelic language is still spoken, but has,
greatly lost ground within these last twenty years. The inhabit-
ants are in general industrious, temperate, economical, and very
hospitable. Some years ago, the best dress of the women was a blue
duffle cloak: now they appear on Sabbath days in silk and muslin
gowns, shawls, and straw bonnets. The farmers wives do not now
make those coarse low-priced cloths for the market, which they
made formerly, owing to their having no sheep, and the price of
wool being high. The ordinary food of the peasantry is oat-
cakes, potatoes- fish, mi k, and, on particular occasions, they have
mutton, beef, &c. They are in general intelligent, moral, and re-
ligious. The distress at present existing in the parish, however,
is great in the extreme. The most of the parish has been con-
verted into sbeep-farms, and consequently, the poor people have
been ejected from their houses and lands, many of them reduced.
to indigence and misery, and others necessitated to emigrate to, a
foreign land. Formerly, smuggling or illicit distillation prevailed
very much,-which was attended with very pernicious consequences
in re gard to health and morals.
