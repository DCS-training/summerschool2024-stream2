     Statistical Account

high road, and not far from Heriot public house, there is a
stone, called Mary Gib's, from an unfortunate woman who
was burnt upon this stone for a witch.  The children, to
this day, in going and coming from school, affect to be af-
fraid when they pass by it.

   Climate and Character.-The air in every part of the
parish is falubrious; hence the inhabitants in general are
very robust and healthy.  Some live to a great age.  One
died lately, born in the last century, and the last minister
was going 87.  The people are industrious, and highly
oconomical, sober, peaceable, humane, and given to ho-
spitality.  Their dress is quite simple, and their manners
plain and unaffected.  They are regular in their attendance
on divine ordinances.  They are rather badly accommo-
dated for houses, which are shabby dirty huts.  Although
the parish is within two or three mile, of lime at Mid-
dleton, they are still built of turf and stone in regular suc-
cession.  The seats of our lairds are very little better.

   Disadvantages.-There is no planting or inclosures in
this parish, except a cow park or two.  This is certainly
a great defect in agricultural improvement; besides, it
with-holds from the country a principal beauty; add to
this, that the lands have no shelter, and even the very sheep
are so exposed, as sometimes to be overwhelmed and buried
in the snow by scores.  A farmer lost about 12 score this
winter in one night.  Such losses are the more serious, as
sheep are the staple commodity of this parish.  Two-horse
ploughs are all in use here; there is no such thing as an

ger.  A reward was off red, that the man who should kill this least should
have there lands.  Accordingly, one had the courage to engage it, and
succeeded.  He called the lands by his own name, Dewar.
