badger, too, was formerly to be met with in the glens, but it is no
longer to be found. Hares and the more common species of
game are numerous, and would become more so, were their illegal
destruction more effectually checked.
	Birds.--Besides above sixty of the common birds of Scotland,
several of the more uncommon species are stationary here. Of the
latter, including the rarer summer and winter visitants, the compiler
of this Account is indebted to Mr John Jamieson, Kilbirnie, a
skilful and enthusiastic ornithologist, for the following interesting
list.

Tetrao Tetrix	          Sylvia Phoenicurus	             Rallus aquaticus
Coturnix vulgaris           Loxia curvirostra                      Fulica atra
Phasianus Colchicus         Parus caudatus                         Scolopax rusticols
Falco peregrinus            Pyrrhula vulgaris                      Tringa pugnax
Buteo vulgaris              Fringilla montifringilla               Cygnus ferus
Buteo palumbarius                     spinus                       Auser ferus
Strix stridula                        carduelis                          Bernicla
Caprimulgus*Europaeus       Sturnus vulgaris                       Podiceps rubdicollis
Lanius excubitor            Garrulus glandarius                    Procellaria glacialis
Turdus torguatus            Alcedo Ispida                          Larus argentatus
Saxicola Rubicola           Ardea stellaris                        Nyroca fuligula

	Fishing.--Kilbirnie loch contains trout, pike, perch, roach, and
eel, the latter especially in abundance; and of the three first very
large ones have occasionally been killed. The Garnock and the
Maich are good trouting streams, particularly the former. There
would, it is believed, be few rivers in the county equal to the
Garnock, in this respect, if the unprincipled destruction of the
fish in its tributary rivulets, during the spawning season, could be
prevented. Last autumn, one individual caught, by means of a
stake-bag-net, no fewer than 150 stones. A few salmon ascend
the river as high as, and even above Kilbirnie, in November and
December, but they are mostly all destroyed by the night poacher.
From a variety of causes, their numbers, it would appear, are year-
ly decreasing. We have been assured that, about fifty years ago,
salmon were to be seen in the latter end of harvest, sporting in
every pool of the river above and below the village, and it is but
rarely now that a few solitary stragglers are to be seen so high.
	Botany.--It does not appear that there is any thing peculiarly
interesting in the botany of the parish. In the lower district, ve-
getation is rather luxuriant, and by no means deficient in variety;
but there are few species of the plants that are generally marked
as rare in Scotland. The following, however, that are not very
common, may be found here:
