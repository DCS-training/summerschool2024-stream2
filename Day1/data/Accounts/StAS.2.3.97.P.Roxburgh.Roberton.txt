  The number of families which attend the Established church is
about 112; and of individuals, old and young, about 626. The
number of Dissenting families is about 19; and of individuals, old
and young, about 104. Divine service is well attended. The
average number of communicants is about 200. There is a Mis-
sionary society in the parish; but is is rather in a languishing state.
Its yearly contributions may be about L. 3.
  Education.-There is one parochial school. The branches
taught are, reading, at 8s. per annum; reading and writing, 10s.;
arithmetic, 12s.; mensuration, &b.; Latin. The salary is the maxi-
mum, and the yearly amount of fees received may be L. 24. The
teacher has the legal accomodations; but the school has been
for ten years by far too small. A splendid new school-house and
schoolmater's house are nearly finished. About one-third of the
parish is so situated that children cannot attend the parish school.
These are at a distance of five and eight miles.
  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
 receiving parochial aid is 15, and theier annual average pay L. 5, 4s.
The amount raised by assessment-one-half upon the heritors,
and the other half upon the tenants-is about L. 100; and that col-
lected in church is about L. 10. There are individual cases where
considerable reluctance is shown in the asking of aid; but this laud-
able spirit, it is feared, is on the decline.
  Alehouse.-There is one alehouse in the parish. Formerly
there were two; but one of them was suppressed, as it gave en-
couragement to tippling, and harboured poachers.
  Fuel.-The common fuel is peat, which can be obtained in
abundance at about 5s. 6d. a cart load, and coals at about 15s. per
cart load of 11 and 12 cwt.
