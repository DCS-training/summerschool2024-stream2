in a fertile and pleasant plain on the banks of the Ithan;
the surrounding eminences being covered with firs, and o-
ther forest trees.  When the addition, which is at present

and most commodious houses in the county.  The present
rent of the parish may be from L. 2500 to L. 3000 Ster-
ling.  In 1634, there was a valuation of the parish made,
in order to fix the value of the teinds, which I subjoin, to
show the then proprietors, and rental of the parish*.
