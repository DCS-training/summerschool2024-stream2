   Bridges.-The bridges on the Dovan, connected with Fos-
saway, are 5.  The Vicars bridge, leading from the north, to
the coal at Blairingone, said to be built by a Vicar, who once
lived at Dollar, but in what year, is uncertain.  It was
widened 6 feet, about 30 years ago.  Higher up the river
stands the Rumbling bridges, built about the year 1723.  The
next is the bridge at the present church of Fossaway, on the
high road from Stirling to Kinross.  It was built in the year
1767.  At a considerable distance farther up the river, stand
other two bridges, distant from each other, about an English
mile.  The first, is called Old Fossaway bridge, because
it is built near where Old Fossaway church stood.  The
other is called St Serfs bridge, and it forms a communication
between the parish of Dunning, and the coal at Blairingone.
Both these bridges were built as they presently stand, within
the last 60 years.

   A Flood on the Dovan.-The greatest flood which has been
observed on the Dovan for many years, was in the month of
Sept. 1785.  The rain began about 4 o'clock in the morning.
About 9, the river was increasing with great rapidity.  At
10, it had covered the marks taken notice of in a large flood.
This led to a closer observation.  The river swelled to at least
18 inches perpendicular, above the height to which it had
been known to rise for many years.  Though the rain, where
these observations were made, continued as violent as ever,
the river began to decrease, nearly in the same proportions in
which it had been increasing a little before.  At first, this
appeared quite inexplicable; but the cause was soon known.
The rain bad abated on the hills, from whence the streams
descend, which supply the river; and all the water that fell on
the low ground, had no influence to keep up the river at its
former height.  At the Rumbling bridge, the river was run-
