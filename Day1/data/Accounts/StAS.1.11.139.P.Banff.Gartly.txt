     of Gartly.

the E. and W. sides, are hilly, and mostly covered with heath.
In these hills there is plenty of moss, which not only supplies
the inhabitants of the parish, but also the town of Huntly,
with fuel.  From these hills several small brooks fall into the
Bogie.  The vallies, supplied by these brooks, are very fer-
tile, as well as the lands on the different sides of the Bogie,
when properly cultivated, though in general rather late.

   Cultivation and Produce.-The cultivation of the soil has
been annually more and more attended to, since the year 1770
At that time there were only two gentlemen farmers, (both
of whom had been in the army), who had a field in turnips
or sown grass; whereas now there is not one, who has not
more or less of his farm under these crops.  One of these
gentlemen, who first set the example, and who is still resident
in the parish, is now carrying his improvements still farther,
by introducing horse-hoeing; whereby he raises most lux-
uriant crops of cabbages and turnips.  The crops are, bear,
oats, pease, and potatoes; and the returns from these do much
more than supply the wants of the parish.

   Cattle.-The lands are now mostly tilled with horses,
which are of different sizes, fitted for the different ways they
are employed; and are in number above 340.  The black
cattle here are generally small, but of a very tight Highland
breed, and about 1,500 in number.  The sheep are also of
a small kind, and in number betwixt 4,000 and 5,000.

   Minerals.-There is a lime quarry in the parish, but so deep,
and expensive to work, that the farmers, rather than dig stone
from it, choose to bring their lime from the distance of 4 or
5 miles.  There is also a very fine slate quarry in the parish.
