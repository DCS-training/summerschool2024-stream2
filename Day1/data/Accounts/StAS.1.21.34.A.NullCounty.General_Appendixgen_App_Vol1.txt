nominated the conveener's board, of which he is president
but he is neither a magistrate nor member of council from
office: but he, or any deacon, may be elected a counsellor,
except the deacons of the fleshers and coopers, who can nei-

   The revenues of this burgh vary according to circumstan-
ces; they amount, at an average, to L. 600 sterling per an-

   The tolbooth, with a spire 138 feet in height, stands in
the middle of the street called the Sandgate, and very much
incommodes those who pass that way, or live in its neigh-
bourhood.  The hall adjoining thereto, where the justiciary
and sherist courts are held, is tolerably large and commodi-
ous.  The town-hall, or assembly room, situated near the
Cross, though not large, is very neat and convenient for an
ordinary company.  The meal market stands near the middle
of the town, but is a great deformity to that part of the street.
The flesh market is very well situated on the edge of the ri-
ver; and is at all times well provided with as good meat as
is any where to be met with.

   Situation and Productions of the Parish.-For about a mile
and a half south of the town, and the same diftance east from
the sea, a flat sandy soil, with very little rising, naturally
yielding a short sweet grass throughout the year, extends
about a furlong or two in breadth along the shore.  Beyond
that, the plain is generally kept in tillage, and, with the
help of manure from the town, and sea-weed from the shore,
produces good wheat, rye, oats, barley, beans, pease, pota-
toes, etc.  At the east side of the plain, nearly a mile and a
half from the shore, the country begins to rise, in several
places, rather abruptly at first, but afterwards more gently
for about two miles, and falls again at the eastern extremity,
