undertakings surmounted, it is said they cost above 
L.14,000 Sterling.  But great as this expense was, it has
been repaid.  By prudent arrangements, and constant at-
tention, the work have succeeded beyond expectation.  
Their success was partly owing to the fidelity and discre-
tion of the managers, and party to the valuable qualities of
the lime, which secured for it a ready and an extensive
sale.  Ever since their commencement, the public has pro-
gressively increased its demands.  From 80,000 to 90,000
tons of limestone are quarried annually.  It is partly manu-
factured into lime at the works; and partly sold in the un-
burnt stone.  Of the manufactured lime; about 200,000 
bolls of shells, or unflocked lime; and from 30,000 to 
40,000 chalders, at 18 bolls the chalder, of slocked lime, 
are annually sold in 1300 separate cargoes.  The total an-
nual value is above L. 10,000 Sterling.  Lime shells, in-
cluding all expense at shipping, are sold at L. 4 Sterling the
hundred bolls; slacked lime at 5 s. 3 d. the chalder, or 3 1/2 d.
the boll; and limestone at 1 s. 8 d. the ton.  The principal 
market for the lime is along the coasts of the frith of Forth 
and Tay, and the N. of Scotland.  From 30 to 50 vessels 
are usually lying at Charlestown, waiting their turns of
loading limeshells during the summer months*.-From the 
very liberal credit that has always been given at these 
works, it is obvious, that a large capital is necessary for
carrying them on.  But neither the money sunk in erecting 
nor conducting them has been lost.  While they have am-
ply rewarded their noble proprietor, they have occasioned 
an extensive circulation of money, retained in their native

*Above 200 men are employed in quarrying, and other necessary ope-
rations.  They work mostly by the piece, and during the limeburning
months, earn from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. the day.  About 4000 chalders, or
12,000 tons of coal, are annually consumed in burning the lime.
