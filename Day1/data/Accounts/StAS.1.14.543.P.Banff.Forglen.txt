     Of Forglen.

4 s. 6 d. the stone; and fowls from 6 d. to 8 d. and 9 d.*-
The most reasonable article of all our provisions is salmon,
which we have in the season, if the fishing is tolerable, at
2 d., and sometimes even so low as 1 1/2 d. the lb, when
there is a good run.  Eggs are scarcely to be had:  they
are carried off to the Banff market, where they get 3 d.,
4 d., 5 d., and 6 d., in times of scarcity, the dozen.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no natural curio-
sities.  Two small wells, one in the wood of Carnousie,
and another on the N. side of the moss of Whitefield, call-
ed the Red-gill Well, are medicinal, and used by the
neighbours.  The one by the moss is a  pretty strong
chalybeate, iron mineral; if a little attention was paid to
it, it might be of use to the neighbourhood:  the water is
said to be as strong as some of those resorted to.  There
is a Druidical temple in the heart of the woods of For-
glen, but shut up thereby from view, till the wood grows
up, and becomes penetrable.  The tenants are in danger
of losing their beasts in them sometimes.  And the deer,
either chased from the herd in the Highland forests, or
pinched with hunger in severe winters, come some of
them down as far as this, and are seen to pasture with
the cattle on the side of the woods.  These woods abound
with foxes for sport, for the supply of the Turriff hunts;
but they frequently make sad depredations among the
poultry around.
   A loch, called the Earl's Loch, on the farm of Scots-
town, was probably named after one of the Earls of Bu-

*The fishers wives and daughters were in use formerly to supply us
with fish, and the farmers gave them a very adequate barter of meal for
them; but now they are up at such rates, that meal, in companion, is
of no value, and will not purchase them.  From 6 d. and 8 d. they
are now up to 1 s. and 1 s. 6 d. at times the dozen.  Our own fish are
cheaper.
