able falls, about a mile below the house and opposite to the
Steel, by the name of Monk's Burn: One of the Pentland,
by some thought to be here a corruption of Pictland, hills,
about a mile up, from behind which this firearm defends, is
called Monk's Rigg (ridge); and the glade or holm through
which the Esk winds, and at the head of which the cottage
stands at its mouth, Monk's Haugh.  At the source of the
stream, however, from the west side of it, ascends one of the
Spittal Hills, near the summit of which is a petrifying spring;
and, advancing a little southward, the other hill, from which
also, a great way up, issues some lime-water of incrusting
quality, though not so strong.  At the foot of this last, in
the verge of a rill coming down from between them, the old
house of Spittal, new roofed, and modernised, now stands.
In the title deeds, the lands are designed, back and??re Spit-
tal, and behind, at the west end of the hollow formed by the
hi11s, and on the side of tile Esk, which almost encircles
them, are some ruins once taken for the original Spittal, but
which now appear only to have been appendages to it.  From
these ruins two paths lead, the one to the Fore, or as it is at
present called, the Old Spittal, on the east through the pass
and the other up the Esk, in the direction of the Fi??h of
Forth.  In the angle below the Old Spittal House, formed
by the hill and Monk's Burn, a piece of very fertile ground
is still called the Glebe Croft; and exactly opposite from
the other side of the burn, rises Monk's Rigg, with Monk's
Road pointing directly to Queensserry and Edinburgh, with
its font-stone in view commanding all the south country on
the brow, and the ornamented top of the cross formerly
erected on its edge, lying at the bottom of the hill.  Previ-
ous to the detachment from Monk's army, therefore, and
this singular coincidence of names, the ridge, burn, and
haugh, from a very different description of inhabitants,???  I
