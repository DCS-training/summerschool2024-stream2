                      Rent.-About L. 1, 2s. per imperial acre. Real rental of the

                      About 400 acres of waste land have, of late years, been brought
                  into cultivation. Lime, of which there is abundance in the parish,
                  is applied with great success as a stimulant. The modern system
                  of husbandry in the low country has been introduced in all its de-
                  partment. Most of the farmers have neat and comfortable houses,
                  instead of the mean and unseemly hovels which they formerly oc-
                  cupied. These ilprovements have been greatly facilitated and
                  accelerated by the formation of good roads, and the erection of
                  bridges. One of the most important of these, a handsome bridge
                  of two arches, was built during last summer across the river
                  Ardle at Kirkmichael, the expense of which, amounting to up-
                  wards of L.500, was raised by voluntary subscription among the
                  public-spirited proprietors and inhabitants of the district.
                      Manufactures.-There is one distillery on the property of Pa-
                  trick Small Keir, Esq., conducted by Mr Alexander Fraser, Pit-
                  carnuck.
                      Fishings.-There are none except trout-fishing in the streams
                  and lochs. Several of the proprietors have a grant of the right
                  of salmon-fishing, in their charters, thereby clearly demonstrat-
                  ing that valuable fish at one time frequented the rivers of Ardle
                  and Blackwater, which unite a little below the Bridge of Cally
                  and from the Ericht; but in consequence of a natural obstruction
                  in the river last named near Blairgowrie, thirteen miles from Kirk-
                  michael, advantage was taken of thd circumstance, perhaps 150
                  years ago, to raise an artificial barrier, which effectually intercepts
                  the progress of the salmon upwards.

                      Ecclesiastical State.-269 families belong to the Established
                  Church; 7 families are Dissenters or Seceders; and there is 1
