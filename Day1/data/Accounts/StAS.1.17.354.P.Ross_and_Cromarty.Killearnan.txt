     Statistical Account

To Mr Grant of Redcastle the succeeding generation will be
much indebted for his extensive plantations of oak, larch,
planetree, ash, elm, and Scotch fir, fenced by at least 20,000
yards of an inclosure; but, however great the exertions of in-
dividuals may be, a bar has hitherto presented itself to the
general improvement of the country, in an extent of unap-
propriated muir, perhaps the most considerable in Great Bri-
tain.  It is lamentable to observe, that the peninsula formed
by the Friths of Beauly and Dingwall, (commonly designed
the Black Isle) contains, it is believed, from 30 to 40 square
miles, abundantly capable of improvement by agriculture or
planting, which still continued in their natural state, not
worth one penny per acre, yet a continual source of jealousy
betwixt the conterminous proprietors.  It is the more so, as
the propriety of a division is admitted on all hands as the
power of the Court of Session, under the act 1695, to carry
it into effect is undoubted, and as nothing is wanting but co-
operation.
   Some of the proprietors are now induced to look to the
well known philanthrophy of the Agricultural Board, for
that effectual interference for carrying this very desirable ob-
ject into effect, which might prove tedious, vexatious, and
irksome, to any private individual.  It would be an object
highly deserving of their attention, which, without subjecting
them to a shilling of expence, would most materially contri-
bute to the good of their country.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The present incumbent was admitted
assistant and successor to his father on the 3d March 1790,
in consequence of a sign manual from the Crown, and a pre-
sentation from Kenneth M'Kenzie, Esq; the representative
of the family of Cromarty.
   He inclines to believe that the right of patronage belongs
to the latter.
