mory of the longest liver.  But there is nothing more cha-
racteristic of the people here, than the assistance they af-
ford, and the sympathy they show to one another in distress,
Instances might be produced of this kind, that would do
honour to more elevated stations.  Though there be a co-
lony of old soldiers in the parish, the ardour for a military
life seems to be saint, and almost none of our young men
enter into the navy.  There is nothing peculiar in their
size, strength, or features.

   Eminent Persons.-The family of Drummond, which has
always been ranked among the most ancient and illustri-
ous of the Scottish nation, and who had for a long time
their chief residence here, gave birth to many characters,
not more distinguised by their high stations, than by their
personal merit; among a variety of these which might be
specified, the brevity of this sketch permits only one to be
mentioned.-Annabella Drummond, daughter of Sir John
Drummond and Lady Mary Montefix.  She was a Lady
of the most exquisite beauty and distinguished accomplish-
ments, and had the honour of being marrid to Robert III.
King of Scotland and crowned at Scone with him in the
month of September 1390.  Her personal charms could
be excelled only by her mental accomplishments.  She
was the ornament of the Court of which she was the
Queen*.  And her death about the year 1401 was 
considered and lamented as a public loss.  Queen Anna-
bella was mother to James I. King of Scotland, and from
her are lineally descended all the royal race of the 
Stuarts.
