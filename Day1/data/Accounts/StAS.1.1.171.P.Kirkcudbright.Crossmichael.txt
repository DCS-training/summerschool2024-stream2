   Fish.-The Urr abounds with trouts, and a great many
salmon come to spawn in it; but few are taken or sold here.
There is a great salmon fishery on the Dee at Kirkcudbright,
and another at Tongland, about two miles above it.  The sal-
mon of the Dee are of a darker colour, and much fatter, than
those of most other rivers in the south of Scotland.  Few of
them get over the steep rocks at Tongland except when the
water is swelled, and those that do are obliged to make the best
of their way past the loch of Ken, as its inhabitants are not re-
markable for hospitality: These are, the pike or ged, the perch,
and the eel.  The pike are found here in great perfection, and
of an uncommon size.  They are always in season when the wea-
ther permits them to be caught.  They are caught with the 
fly, or with lines baited with burn trouts or frogs.  The perch
were first introduced into this river and loch in the year
1750, by the late Alexander Copland, Esq, of Collieston.
Since that time they have multiplied remarkably, and are
now taken in great quantities, especially about midsummer,
by those who fish with worm baits for amusement.  The eels
are never interrupted in their possession of the waters, as the
country people have an insuperable prejudice against feeding
on an animal which so strongly resembles the serpent.  The
case, however, was different in former times.  In the dark
ages, when the art of cookery was but little understood, there
was, in this parish, a fishery of eels, which were exported to
Italy.  This is mentioned by Hector Boethius, and after him
by Buchanan.

   Population.-As records have not been regularly kept, the
antient state of population here cannot be precisely ascertain-
ed.  The knowledge of some facts hath however been pre-
served.  From the year 1751 to 1761 the baptisms were 128,
being, on an average, about 13 yearly.  For the 16 following
