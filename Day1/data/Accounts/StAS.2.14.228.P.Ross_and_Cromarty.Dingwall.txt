     Naviqation.-There are but two small vessels belonging to this
        place. They were built here, and are employed in the coast trade.
   But, besides these, the port is frequented by vessels of different
   descriptions, which supply the district with lime, coal, &c.
   	Associations.-The " Farmers' Society for Wester Ross," which
   has for its object the promotion of agriculture and its interests in
   this district, holds its quarterly meetings at Dingwall. Of this so-
   ciety all the principal farmers, and most of the landed proprietors
   around, are members. At these meetings the business consists in
   reading essays, detailing experiments, describing new inventions or
   improvements on the implements of husbandry, and in deliberating
   on the general interests of agriculture. The influence of this so-
   ciety has been considerable in improving stock, by promoting local
   exhibitions, &c. in bringing modern discoveries in the theory or
   practice of farming into general notice, and in fostering feelings of
   kindliness and intimacy, such as should ever subsist between land-
   lord and tenant.
   			V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   	The burgh of Dingwall contains a population of 1715, amount-
   ing to about four-fifths of the whole population of the parish.
   	Having no manufactures, the trade of Dingwall is very limited,
   being confined, on the one hand, to the importation of those various
   articles of merchandise which are required for the supply of the
   surrounding country; and, on the other, to the exportation of corn,
   timber, bark, and such other country produce as can be convenient-
   ly procured to form a freight for the vessels which bring hither coal,
   lime, and other commodities.
