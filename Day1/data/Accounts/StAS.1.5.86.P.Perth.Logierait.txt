of Tummel.  Near the castle is a field, called Cannon-brae,
upon which, if we might believe tradition, was a battery.

   Remarkable Natural Phenomena.-About thirty years ago,
a shock of an earthquake was felt here; its direction was
from east to west; its duration about a second or two.  On
the 25th of June 1778, a water spout did considerable da-
