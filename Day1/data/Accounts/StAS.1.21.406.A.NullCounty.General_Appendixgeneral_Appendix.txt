cumbent and his heirs a recourse against his successor in office for
his outlay in improvements.
   Many difficulties, however, present themselves as to the
general arrangement and practical execution of such a scheme.
   1mo, The improvements taken under the comprehension
of a statute of this natures must be such as cannot be supposed
to indemnify the improving incumbent, during the ordinary
period of an incumbency; otherwise an unnecessary bribe is
thrown out to induce improvements which would take place
of course:  They must also be of a nature readily defined,
and whose expence can he readily ascertained.  Under such
limitations, perhaps a general statute could only properly ap-
ply to inclosure, and trees left standing; in regard to the last
too it would seem hard to oblige the successor to pay for
them at their value unless he were to be at liberty to cut
and sell them-if the value the glebe would give in rent is
to be ascertained at the time an incumbent begins to im-
prove, and the value to be also ascertained upon his incum-
bency ceasing, and the purchase money of the difference of
value, is to be charged against his successor; in that case the
Jury would need to be able to judge betwixt the mere nomi-
nal difference in respect of the difference of the value of
money, (which may take place to a considerable extent dur-
ing an incumbency) and the real difference arising from the
increase of the powers of production.
   2do, Is the expence of improvement, once ascertained, to
be entailed as a perpetual debt against every successor in of-
fice:  or is the first immediate successor to be made the scape
goat and to pay the ransom for the whole?  If it is to be a
perpetual debt, must there be a fresh valuation upon each
succession; or is no allowance to be made for deterioration?
   3tio, At whose direction are the inclosures or the planta-
tions to be conducted?  Every one knows that either may be
