     Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.

burgh, extends, from south to north, about 2 miles, and
from east to west, where it is broadest, a mile and a half.
The southern part of it is divided by the river South Eik; o-
ver which, a stately bridge is thrown at Cockpen. Every
where within the parish, the banks of the river are bold and
beautifully fringed with natural wood.-The soil is a strong
clay; which, with proper cultivation, produces excellent grain,
and in sufficient quantities.-The climate is dry and pure.-

been extracted.

Dalhousie, has the largest property. His Lordship, and Sir
James Murray, have their principal seats in the parish.-The
