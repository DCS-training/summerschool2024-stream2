				UNITED PARISHES OF
			URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER.*

		    PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS.

		     THE REV. JOHN MACDONALD, MINISTER.

		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THIS parish, now known by the name of Urquhart, is
	in all church records designated the united parishes of Urquhart
	and Loggie Wester; the former, comprehending the eastern, and
	the latter, the western  district of the parish as now constituted.
	As the designation intimates, it was originally, two distinct pa-
	rishes; but at what period the union took place has not been as-
	certained.  It seems, however, probable, from a reference made to
	the parishes in an old manuscript in the Advocates' Library, that
	they had been incorporated as early as the year 1490, it being
	therein stated that one Mr Munro was, at that time, vicar of Ur-
	quhart and Loggie-Wester.
	  In regard to the designation Urquhart,--it derives its origin ac-
	cording to a tradition still current in the place, from the first
	church, on the erection of the parish, having been built by a lady
	of eminent piety, by name Sophia Urquhart, in Gaelic, Sitheag
