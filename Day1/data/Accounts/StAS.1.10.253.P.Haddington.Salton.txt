   Cultivation and Product-This parish has been long re-
markable for its fertility and excellent crops, and still re-

are sown with success, but wheat and oats are reckoned the
best crops.  The excellence of these grains has been much in-
creased, since the new mode of culture was introduced.  The
custom, which a few years ago prevailed here, of raising two
or three white crops in succession, impoverished the soil, and
consequently diminished both the quantity and quality of the
grain.  This pernicious system of farming is now, however,
pretty generally exploded; and the following rotation is subs-
tituted in its place, viz. fallow, wheat, beans or pease, bar-
ley, grass, oats.  In this variety the soil seems to delight; and
the return upon the whole is much more for the benefit of
the farmer.  Another circumstance promises to improve still
farther the grain produced in this parish, a renewal of the
use of lime.  So early as the beginning of this century, lime
was adopted as a manure in this place; its application, how-
ever, to this purpose was gradually discontinued, and at
length totally laid aside, from an opinion that it was of no
advantage in the improvement of land.  This opinion was
founded on an idea, that, as the farms lay on a stratum of
limestone, the soil must of course be impregnated with it, and
a further application would for this reason be unnecessary.
This prejudice, however, is daily losing ground, and liming
