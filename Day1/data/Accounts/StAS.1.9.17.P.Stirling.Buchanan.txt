     of Buchanan.

   Woods.-Near the house of Buchanan there is an old oak
wood; great additions have been made to which within these
40 years past.  The present Duke of Montrose is planting
a great deal of different kinds of trees in the bottom of Bu-
chanan, which in process of time, if properly taken care of,
must turn out greatly to the advantage of the family, as
well as to the beauty of the place.  In the island of Inch-
cailloch there is a large oak wood.  From the Grampian
hills to the north end of the parish, along the side of the
loch, is one continued wood, consisting of some ashes, alders,
hazels, but mostly oaks.  Woods are of late become very
valuable on the sides of Lochlomond, as the timber and
bark are easily transported by water to Glasgow, Port-
Glasgow and Greenock, and sometimes are carried to Ire-
land and the welt of England.

   Climate and Diseases.-This country in general is rather
wet, not however unhealthy.  Fevers are rare, and gene-
rally brought from other places, especially from the towns,
and from the public works that are going on at no great
distance from hence, as bleaching, printing cloth, and spin-
ning cotton; the children or connections of people in this
parish turning sickly in those places, are brought home, and
sometimes the neighbours are infected by them.  In that
way also the small-pox was brought into this parish in
winter last.  The disease spreading fast, about 30 of the
young people in the neighbourhood where it was, took it;
10 of whom died.  All the parents whole children had not
taken it, (two or three excepted), as if it were with one
consent, inoculated their children at one and the fame
time; so that there are just now under inoculation in this
parish 128.  Several of whom I have seen; many of
them appeared to be pretty easy; others had a good
