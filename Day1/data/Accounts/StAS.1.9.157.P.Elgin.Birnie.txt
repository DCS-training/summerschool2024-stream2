     of Birnie.

   Climate.-The air is pure along the banks of the Lossie,
but rather moist among the hills.  They rise to a consider-
able height above the Lossie, and attract more showers than
the low land.  The inhabitants, however, in each of these
places, are equally healthful, and free from any disorder,
but such as are common all over this country.

   Minerals, Trees, Animals, etc.-A large chain of rocks
extend east and west through the middle of the parish.  The
greatest part of the country houses are built with moor
stones, which abound in every hill.  Some strata of free-
stone, of state and limestone, have been lately discovered.
The freestone and slate have been used in repairing the
church and manse.  There are some oak, birch, hazle, ash,
and plane trees; hut they are not sufficient for supplying
the implements of husbandry.  Some large trunks of oak
and fir are dug out of the mosses.  Of there the inhabitants
make very strong couples and lath for their houses.  Fruit
trees are scarce.  The shrubs of broom, furze, juniper, sloes,
hips and brambles, are innumerable.  The water-lilly is
the only herb, which perhaps is peculiar to this parish, it
grows in the Gedloch.  Moorfowl, partridge and hare are
the principal game.  The Earl of Moray, as tradition re-
lates, used often to hunt and shoot on these hills.  That he
might have accommodation during the sporting season, he
allotted a croft of land to the vintner, and another to the
blacksmith; for which the one paid a rose, and the other a
horse shoe, yearly, if required.  The crofts still retain the
names of Brewer's-croft and Smithy-croft.  The lapwing
appears in March, the cuckoo in April, and the swallow
in May; they all begin to disappear about the end of sum-
mer.
