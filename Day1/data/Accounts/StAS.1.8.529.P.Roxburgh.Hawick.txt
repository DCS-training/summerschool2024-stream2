*The manufacture of stockings was originally begun by Bailie John Hardle,
in the year 1771.  He employed 4 looms; which, at an average, produced
annually about 2,400 pairs, mostly of the coarser kind.  He seems to have been the
first, that introduced this business into this country; and, by persons taught in
his shop, it has been planted in Wooler, Kelfo, Jedburgh, Langholm, Melrose,
and Selkirk.  From family distress he abandoned it, after carrying it on for
10 years, when it was taken up by Mr. Nixon.
