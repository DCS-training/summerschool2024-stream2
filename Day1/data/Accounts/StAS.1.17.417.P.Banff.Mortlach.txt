mer and the labouring man are weaker and worse than they
were, it must be owned,-and owned with particular regret;
for such men, engaged with heart's case in the healthful pur-

   Springs.-Here are several steel or chalybeate springs; and
some of them pretty powerful.  One, in particular, near the
old castle of Auchindown, has been found, on chymical exa-

to be as light as it.  They are of use in gravelish complaints
and disorders of the stomach.  There is likewise, below the
house of Kinninvie, a spring of a petrifying quality, on the li-
mits between Mortlach and Boharm.

   Rivers.-Fiddich and Dullan, the two little rivers of
this parish, have been already mentioned.  Dovern is much
larger than either of them.  But Mortlach can scarce claim
any property in it; as it only borders, for a few hundred
yards, upon one of its extremities.  Fiddich rises in Glen-
fiddich, towards Strathdon; and Dullan in Glenrinnes, on
the boundaries of Glenlivet.  They join a little below the
kirk, near the house of Tininver, and fall into the Spey a-
bout 4 miles below.  After their confluence, Fiddich is the
name.  Their whole run may be about a dozen or fourteen
miles each; and there is good angling for small trout, in plen-
ty, on them both.

   Lake.-From the public road, leading from this to Botriph-
ny, may be seen, on the left, in a den confined by two al-
most perpendicular hills, a small but deep lake, called Loch-
park, the source of the Isla, which flows into Doveron in the
parish of Rothiemay.  It is frequented by wild ducks, and is
