Doons++, five moats, and a hill opposite to two of them, cal-
led the Gallows-Hill; but, as the figure, use, and design of
these relicts of antiquity have been so often explained by
others, a repetition here is unnecessary.

   Proposed Improvements.-There is a creek at the side of the
Dee, very nigh the manufacturing house formerly mentioned,
that might easily be turned into a good harbour, sheltered
from every storm.  The adjacent field is commodious for wet
and dry docks, such as they have at Liverpool; the stream
of water that drives the machinery would serve to clean
them; spring tides 30 feet perpendicular; and there is at the
same time considerably more than 17 feet of water upon the
barr at the mouth of the river.  A great road opened from
the kirk of Twyneholm to the N. N. W. through an open-
ing in the hill of Glengape, would give access to manure
landed in the Tarf or the Dee, for wild and barren grounds.

   Disadvantages.-The wetness of our climate, the scarcity
of fuel, and no rock salt upon our coast, with other causes,
render that necessary article at times scarce and dear.  For
these two years past, the scarcity of this article has been
so great, about the term of Martinmas, as materially to hurt
the sale of our fat cattle.  This might be easily remedied by
allowing rock salt to be imported, or salt ready made from
Liverpool, at the Scotch duties.  One of there measures ought to

++Some time ago, there was raised from beneath a heap of stones, not far
from that spot, what appeared like a coffin made up of different stones, in
which was found an instrument resembling a hammer, and some coins; but
of what metal the instrument was made, or where to be found, or of what
kind the coins were, no information can now be obtained.  There have been,
several coins found nigh to these moats, but none of them are preserved
