     of Glencairn.

Craigdarroch's feus.  It is divided from Dunreggan by
Dalwhat-water, over which, there is stone bridge.-
Dunreggan, which is on the property of Mr Fergusson of
Cailloch, is little inferior to Minniehive, in extent or num-
ber of houses, which are annually increasing.  The far great-
er part of them has been built within these 20 or 30 years.
In the two villages, there are 98 families.

   Poor.-Public collections, in particular cases of great dis-
tress, are sometimes made; but the interest of L. 12o ster-
ling, and the common weekly collections on Sunday, are all
the stated supplies for the ordinary poor of the parish.  For
these 8 or 10 years past, L. 30 has been annually expended on
the poor, from these sources, one year with another.

   Rent.-The valuation of the parish is 12,062 1/2 merks.  As

L. 800 and L. 9000 sterling.-There are about 90 farms in
this district, several of them considerable; and frequently uni-

fort, two of which are led, (i. e. the tenant does not reside
upon them,) there are 25 persons, old and young, 20 score
of sheep, 110 black cattle, and 6 horses; and the rents may
amount to L. 170 sterling.  This may serve to give some idea
of the value of the whole.

   Antiquities.-There is a mount, commonly called a Moat,
about half a mile from the church, very steep, and of conside-
rable height, occupying about an acre of ground, and evi-
dently made by art.  It is of an oblong form, with an earth-
en turret at each end, having a deep trench on the inside of
each turret.  One of these turrets, and the base of the mount, in
