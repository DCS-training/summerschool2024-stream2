the former stock, making in all 2120.  It is only in this part of
the district, the numbers are kept up.  They have been de-
creasing in the west part of the parish, for many years, and
now are reduced to one flock.  In this flock, are a great pro-
portion of long tailed sheep without horns; their pasture is
higher, and of course, more dry and nourishing; the sheep
of a larger size, and finer wool.  But in the east part of the
parish, the grass is of a coarser nature, and the soil more sub-
ject to retain water from its flatness; the sheep of a smaller
size, the 4 quarters weighing from 20 to 26 pounds.  The
time was, when every farm in the district, had a flock be-
longing to it; till the culture of clover and rye-grass became
general, and every spot of grass land was made to feel the
pulverising effects of the plough and harrow, when it was
thought more profitable to part with these meek, harmless,
and useful creatures.
   In the Tents moors, smuggling was carried on to a great
extent, by those men in the neighbourhood, who were de-
termined to risk their fortune and character on the events of
a day; for the inhabitants of this corner, were only assisting
in concealing and transporting their unlawful imports.  By
the wife and vigorous interposition of the directors of our
justly admired government, smuggling, that illicit traffic big
with many evils to mankind, is now happily unknown over
all our coasts.  The inhabitants of this remote corner have
been blamed for cruelty to ship-wrecked sailors.  If the
charge be just it does not belong to them alone; they are
but a handful; the place is thinly peopled.  In the days of
old, it might have been so; but I have seen much attention
and kindness shewn to such unhappy sailors as were cast upon
our shore.  I trust, and believes that every future period
shall be marked with an increase of brotherly love to the un-
fortunate.
