nomy of the farms, and their produce is 4125 stones, besides
which, 51 pecks are sown by adventurers for premiums, etc.
producing 171 stones; in whole 4296 stones of flax.  All this
is made into yarn by the women of the parish, (12 years old
and upwards), and affords them constant employment for six
months in the year, and not a little in the remaining months.
The yarn, all but a small part of it manufactured for domestic
purposes, is sold to hawkers and others who purchase for the
great manufactories.  Weavers in the country indeed purchase
some part of it, which they sell again in webs of green cloth.
A spindle from the lb. of heckled flax is the common size of
yarn for sale.  Of late the spinning wheels with two flies have
become pretty frequent, with which woman spin near twice
as much as with the wheels of one fly.  The thread is coarser;
but as the flax is but slightly heckled, there are more pounds
from the stone weight, and families experience this size of
yarn to be the more profitable.  Some young women in the
parish, without any previous teaching, are able to spin so fine
a thread as 3 1/2 spindles from the lb. avoirdupois.
   There are five lint mills in the parish, most of them are
accommodated with large sheds roofed with slate, for stowing
unskutched flax.  The board of trustees for manufactures
have given much encouragement to these erections, and have
lately furnished one of the weavers with a diaper loom.
