and, as the soil, so the surface and climate are unequal,
which, indeed, is generally the case over the county, by the
sudden transitions from hill to dale.  The lands towards the
Rule and the Tiviot, are, therefore, more deep, warm, and
fertile.  In those towards the hill called the Dunian*, the
soil becomes more light, thin, and barren; the air keen and
penetrating: yet, in regard to the soil, there happens to be
a remarkable exception, for, on the same range of hill to
the westward, opposite the village of Bedrule, there is an
uncommonly fine and deep soil; and in the above grounds,
where the soil is in general remarkably deep, there is also
found limestone, and different strata of clay marle.  A good
deal of the land in that part of the parish is at present rather
spouty.  But, as it is a gentle declivity from the summit of
the hill to the banks of the river, it might be the more ea-
sily rendered dry by judicious draining.

     Proprietors and Tenants.-There are three great, and five
less considerable proprietors in the parish, two of whom u-
sually reside.  There are nearly the same number of tenants,
who all manage their farms according to the modern practice
of husbandry; and one of them, Mr Brown, the tenant of
Newton, a farm the property of Thomas Elliot Ogilvie,
Esq; of Chesters, has, in the course of a few years, shown
how much may be done by improvement in this parish, both
for the advantage of the tenant, and the patrimonial interest
of the proprietor.  Mr Bell younger of Mainflaws, and
the tenant of Rewcastle, both in this parish, appear to be fol-

*The Dunian is wholly in the parish of Bedrule; but owing perhaps to
part of it having been for some time possessed by the tenant of an adjoining
farm in the parish of Jedburgh, the author of the Statistical account thereof
has been led to suppose, it was partly situated in that parish.
