believe, that computations, though, perhaps inaccurate in regard to parti-
cular districts, may on the whole be right.  Where they are drawn upon a
great scale, and on proper data, they may approach very near the truth,
even where, in many of the minute particulars, there are considerable er-
rors*.
   In the following Statistical Tables there are 14 Columns.
   Column 1.  This will merely contain the names of the different Parishes
in each Country, arranged in alphabetical order, to which, if thought neces-
sary, might be added, the volume of the Statistical Account of Scotland,
where the description of each parish is to be found.  In several instances,
parishes are situated in different countries.  Where that is the case, the whole
district is included in that county, where either the Church or the greater
part of the parish is situated.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The following example will explain the meaning of this observation.
Let us suppose that there are 4 parishes, the valued rent of which is known,
but only two of which have their real rent returned; for instance,

<TABLE>

   Valued Rent, Scotch money.       Real Rent, Sterling money.
     No. 1      L. 5300                      L. 3100
         2         3500                         1300
                   ----                         ----
                L. 8800                      L. 4400

</TABLE>

   It is evident, that the average of the two parishes, is at the rate of L. 2
of valued, to L. 1 of real rent
   Let us suppose, that the other two parishes, have their valued rent return-
ed as follows.

<TABLE>

           Valued Rent
   No.  3    L. 4200
        4       7550
               ----- 
            L. 11750

</TABLE>

   According to the data above mentioned, the real rent of No. 3 ought
to be L. 2100, and of No. 4 L. 3775, both of which may be wrong; the
one may be too much, and the other too little, yet the one error may cor-
rect the other, and the total result may be perfectly right.
   So accurate, however, was the above mode of computation found, that
the real rent of one parish, computed at L. 2450, was found, by the Mini-
ster's return, to be L. 2460.
