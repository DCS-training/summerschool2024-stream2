ed, was encroached on, and by 1815 exhausted. Previous to 1828,
the assessment was laid upon land only, according to the valued
rent, but since that time, houses as well as land have been as-
sessed, the real rent of both being taken as the rule, and a de-
duction of one-fourth being allowed, in estimating the rent of houses,
for the expense of repairs. Pauperism has cerntainly increased here
of late years. This has arisen in some measure from the depres-
sed state of the weaving trade, but still more, it is to be feared,
from the decay of the old independent spirit. During the year
ending in February 1835 there have been raised for the mainte-
nance of the poor,

<FOOTNOTES>It may be worth while to subjoin the following tabular view of the state of the
enrolled poor of the parish, for the year ending as above. It may furnish the means
of comparison with the scale of parochial relief in other parishes. The relations bound
to support are all grown up, unless where otherwise mentioned.
