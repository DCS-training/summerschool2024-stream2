and Was circulated with amazing rapidity through all the Pro-
testant churches abroad.  It was translated, if my informa-
tion be right, into one of the eastern languages, at the ex-
pence of the Hon. Robert Boyle, a promoter both of piety
and learning.  Dr. Owen, a divine of, the last century, of
extraordinary erudition, said of this little treatise, ' It is my

more divinity in this than in them all.'

   Ravages of the Plague.-In the year 1647, the plague made
prodigious havock in Brechin.  Six hundred persons died of
the infection in the space of a few months.  The most of
them were buried in the little church-yard opposite to the
porch door of the church; and the graves have not been
opened to this day.  A part of them were buried in the large
church-yard; and the graves there were opened, about 26
years ago, with no small apprehension of danger: however,
through the goodness of Providence, no bad consequence
ensued.  The following inscription, on a monument in the
little kirk-yard, sufficiently verifies the present narrative.-

     1647.
     Luna quater crescens
     Sexcentos peste peremptos,
     (Disce mori!) vidit.
     Pulvis et umbra sumus.
