     Statistical Account

wheels, leather, and dye-stuffs imported here, nor any va-
lue set upon the carts, cart-wheels, ploughs, labouring
utensils, and household-furniture, sent to the country, which
is very considerable, and that no statement is made of the
freights drawn for ships employed in trade not connected
with this port, I am very confident I have no reason to
make the amount of the trade less than I have represented
it; and if I were to make any alterations, it would be
only to show, that the trade probably is considerably above
L. 100,000.
