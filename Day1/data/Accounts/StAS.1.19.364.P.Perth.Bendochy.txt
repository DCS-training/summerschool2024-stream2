   Climate.-For two months of summer there is a strong twi-
light all night, so that one can read ordinary print by it in
the open air at midnight; the sun being only 10 degrees
under the horizon.  In summer, in the shade, the thermo-
meter stands at about 60§ on Farenheit's scale, in warm
weather above, and in cold weather below that point.
There is almost no difference between the state of the ther-
mometer here, and that at Edeinburgh, as printed in the
newspapers; in winter, the thermometer is very variable.
One night, in December 1794, it was down 24ø below
freezing.  This was very uncommon.  The W. wind is
the most common; it is a dry wind.  The N. wind is also
dry, and blows in winter.  The E. wind is accompanied
with rain; but in spring it is sometimes dry.  The S. wind
is a wet wind, and seldom blows.  The S. W. wind, which
blows in the direction of the strath, is the most common of
all others.  The air is often still at evening and morning,
and then the S. W. wind blows at mid-day, and in the af-
ternoon a good gale.  The barometer is high in good wea-
ther and frost, and falls after wind and rain.
   A great fall of snow in winter seems to change the cli-
mate above it from the time of its fall, while it continues
upon the ground.  It prevents the cold of the atmosphere
from descending to the earth, and the heat of the earth from
ascending to the atmosphere.  Ground that is not frozen
when the snow falls on it, will not freeze after.  One day
a good many years ago, I saw the hoar frost on the ice of
the river, in the morning, half an inch long.  It was fea-
thered like fern, and had great resemblance to vegetation.
The icy particles at that time clouded the atmosphere, and
individually were visible to the eye.  Though the frost in
December 1794 was the most severe ever known, there
was a pool of still water in Isla river that did not freeze.
I think that a complete coat of ice alters the temperature
