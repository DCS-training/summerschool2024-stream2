commandolent de ma part.  Je ne doute point que votre Majeste
voudra bien lui faire resentir les effects de sa genereuse re-
connoisance, tant a l'egard de dites services, que de ma pres-
sante intercession; a laquelle je n' ajouterai que l'assurance du
respect et attachment sincere avec lequell, Je suis,
     Madame ma soeur,
     Barcelone, ce 12 mo. Nov.      Votre tres affectione frere
     de 1707. CHARLES.

   The above translated may run thus.

     Madam my Sister,
   Captain James Moodie, who commands the vessel Lan-
caster, has rendered me services so important, that I owe al-
most entirely to his zeal, the preservation of my city of De-
nia, which, being destitute of all kinds of provision, could
not have held out against a siege of five weeks, unless the
said Captain had furnished a supply, at the request of those
who commanded on my part.  I doubt not but your Ma-
jesty will make him a handsome and generous return, both
on account of the said services, and of this my pressing inter-
cession: To which I shall only add, the assurance of that re-
spect and sincere attachment with which I am,
     Madam my Sister,
     Your very affectionate brothers
     CHARLES.

   With regret I add, that the above gentleman, at the ad-
vanced age of between 70 and 80 years, was basely murder-
ed in the streets of Kirkwall, by the hand of a hired villain,
and at the instigation of a rebel, Sir James Stewart.
