   Ecclesiastical State.--The church is mentioned in a charter
of Donald, Earl of Lennox, about the middle of the fourteenth
century.  The patronage appears to have belonged to this family
until the widow of Earl Duncan erected the collegiate church of
Dumbarton in 1450, and endowed it with this church.

   Education.--There are 7 schools in the parish two of which
are parochial. The average amount of each of the parochial
schoolmasters' salaries is L.21, 7s., with L.15 of school fees, and
L.7 of other emoluments, being the yearly worth of the dwelling-
house, school-room, and garden. Two of the non-parochial
schools are taught by females. About seven-eighths of the po-
pulation inhabit the Vale of Leven, and are employed at the
public works, bleachfields, and printfields: to these works the chil-
dren are sent, in too many cases, at and under seven years of age;
and any learning they get afterwards is at the week day evening
and Sunday evening schools. (Abstract Education Inquiry, 1887).
