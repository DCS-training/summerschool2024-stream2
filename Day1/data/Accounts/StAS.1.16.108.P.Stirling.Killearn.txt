and taken sometimes in great numbers.-At this place,
but on the Drymen side of the water*, is Gartness mill,
which has long maintained a high reputation for grain and
lint.  The remarkable services done the public by this
mill during the great frost in the year 1740, were so sea-
sonable, that they will not for a long time be forgotten.
It fortunately happened, that in 1739 the mill received a
new wheel of a very good construction.  It was made of
black saugh (willow) that grew at Touch, a few miles
from Stirling.  This kind of wood, of all others, was then
preferred for making mill-wheels; its excellency was sup-
posed to consist in toughness and durability.  Owing to
the strength and other properties of the wheel, Gartness-
mill was, by the aid of a constant fire, kept a-going during
the severity of the frost, when all other mills, for a great
way round, were entirely stopped.  Corn at that time was
brought to Gartness from great distances, and thereby ma-
ny families were kept from starving.-Adjoining the mill
are the remains of an old house in which John Napier
of Merchiston, inventor of the logarithms, resided a great
part of his time (for some years) when he was making his
calculations.  It is reported, that the noise of the cascade
being constant, never gave him uneasiness, but that the
clack of the mill, which was only occasional, greatly di-
sturbed his thoughts.  He was, therefore, when in deep
study, sometimes under the necessity of desiring the miller
to stop the mill, that the train of his ideas might not be in-
terrupted.  He used frequently, in the evening, to walk
out in his night-gown and cap.  This, with some things
which to the vulgar appeared rather odd, fixed on him the
character of a warlock.  It was firmly believed, and cur-
rently reported that he was in compact with the devil; and
