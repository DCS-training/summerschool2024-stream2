   Of the Episcopal persuasion, to which, with few exceptions, the
fishermen at the three stations belong, besides those in the north-
ern, there are about 250 in the southern district. Of the United
Secession, Church, there are 120 members in full communion,
who, with their families, worship in a commodious building at
Stonehaven. There are also a few families of the Methodist con-
nection, and one of the Roman Catholic.
   The following is a list of the ministers of Fetteresso from the
Reformation to thd present time:--Mr John Christesoun, minis-
ter of Fetteresso, Dunnottar, and Glenbervie, 1567. Archibald
Rait, reader at Fetteresso, 1567-1576. Mr Patrick Brown, died
1579. Mr Andrew Milne,* translated from Dunnottar, November
1579; died 1605. Mr Andrew Milne, Junior, admitted 1605;
died October 12, 1640. Mr Patrick Leslie, translated from
Skene, 1640. Mr John Milne,+ 1676; died January 1703. Mr
John Webster, admitted March 13th 1705; translated to New
Deer, April 1707. Mr David Burn, admitted November 2d,
1709; died May 1749. Mr Alexander Forbes, admitted Fe-
bruary 1750; died January 1759. Mr John Ballantyne, admitted
June 1760; died October 1762. Mr William Shank, admitted
February 1763; died in August following. Mr John Hutcheon,
admitted 1764; died February 27, 1800. Mr George Thom-
son, (the present incumbent), admitted September 18th 1800.+
The present incumbent, on entering on his office, was told by
several persons, that he was the sixth minister of the parish whom
they had seen. Considering the period during which his imme-
diate predecessor filled the charge, the circumstance appeared
very remarkable; but the above statement will show its consisten-
cy with truth.
   The stipend consists of 17 chalders, half barley, half oatmeal,
paid in money, according to the county fiars prices, the average of
which, for the last seven years, has been for barley, L. 1, 6s, 9 1/2d.

<FOOTNOTE>Mr Andrew Milne, Senior, was schoolmaster of Montrose, and the preceptor of
Mr James Melville, who, in his Diary, speaks of him as a "lerned, honest, kynd
man, verie skilfull and diligent." He was appointed minister at Dunlappy in 1571,
whence he was translated to Dunnottar in 1578. He appears to have been much em-
ployed in the ecclesiastical affairs of the period.
	 On the death of Mr Milne in 1703, Mr Gideon Guthrie, an Episcopal preacher,
intruded himself into the church and manse, with the connivance of Earl Marischal,
the partron, and retained possession till May 1709, when he was ejected by a sentence
of the Court of Justiciary.
	 For the information contained in the above list, and kind aid in this report,
grateful acknowledgements are offered to Mr G. R. Kinloch of Edinburgh, and also
to Mr Duncan of Aberdeen,--both eminent for their attainments is every branch of
antiguarian knowledge.
