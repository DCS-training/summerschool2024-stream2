riches, and power of the Romish hierarchy.  The high church 
of Peebles, dedicated to St. Mary, which from the remains 
of it in the church yard, was large enough to accommodate 
the parish at this time, is reckoned to have been built, or ra-
ther rebuilt, in the 11th century, when the churches were ge-
nerally rebuilt in a better manner, as from some very old free-
stone rebuilt in its walls, it is evident that it only succeeded 
to one that was greatly more ancient.  To the chaplains of 
St. Mary in Peebles, K. David granted the corn and wauk-

court in the middle, 124 feet by 110 over all.  The church 
formed the south side of the square, and was 104 by 26 feet 
within walls.  The front wall was built with a small arch 
over the spot where the cross and the remains of the Saint 
were deposited; so that the religious, whether within or with-
