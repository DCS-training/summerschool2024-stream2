E. sides, down to the Solway frith, and is at least 10 miles
long, and from 2 to 3 broad.  It seems to have been once
an inlet from the Solway frith.  A stratum of sea sand in
found at certain depths, pieces of vessels, dug up in various
parts of it, have been seen by persons who are still alive.  A
kind of a canoe, with an iron anchor or grapple, is said to
have been found as far up as Tinwald-house.  Large pieces
of the roots and trunks of trees are also found in it, betwixt
the surface and the sand.  Indeed, many large trees, chiefty
sir, have been found in this moss, and uniformly laid with
their tops to the N. E.  From these circumstances it should

dryness of the soil, and the high winds, which occasionally
prevail, obviate, in a great measure, the ill effects which
might otherwise be produced by the moisture of the atmos-
phere.  There are here and there in this parish a few small
springs, and one in particular in the middle of Lochermoss,
called Crichton's well, having a pretty strong impregnation
of steel.  There are 2 or 3 inconsiderable lakes.  The Nith
is navigable to the town in spring tides for vessels of 30
or 40 tons.  A canal was once proposed to be drawn through
Lochermoss, which, besides draining the moss, might
have afforded navigation for small boats from the head of
the moss to Solway frith.  The estimate of the expence, as
