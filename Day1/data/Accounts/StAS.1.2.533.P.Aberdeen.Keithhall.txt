     of Keith-Hall and Kinkell.

   Mode of Cultivation.-The ancient division of tbe land
was into infield, outfield, and fauchs.  The infield was dunged,
every 3 years, for bear; and the two crops that followed bear
were oats invariably.  The outfield was kept five years in
natural grass; and, after being tathed by the farmer's cattle,
who were folded or penned in it, during the summer, it bore
5 successive crops of oats.  The fauschs, after being 5 years in
natural grass, got a single plowing, (hence they were called one
fur ley), the land continuing without a crop for one year, and
then bearing four crops of oats, without any dung.  The species
of oats used for this last, and partly for the outfield, is called
small oats, hairy oats, or shiacks.  They yield from five pecks,
to half a boll of meal.  And are measured by handwaving, i. e.
they are stroked by the hand about 4 inches above the top of
the firlot.  They raise a great deal of fodder, or forage; and
exhaust the groud more than any other crop.
   Since the introduction of turnips, the farmers make it a ge-
neral rule, not to take more than one, and never more than two
crops of oats in succession, in their infield grounds.  But in re-
gard to the outfields and fauchs, when they manure them with
lime, without taking a turnip crop, the wretched system of 5
successive crops of oats is still continued.  Two or three far-
mers begin to think of a rotation of crops; without fixing,
however, on any regular rotation.  The old Scottish plough,
the Yorkshire, and a mixture of Scots and English ploughs,
are used in this district.

   Forest and Fruit Trees.-There is a considerable number
of large ash and plane, and a few good Scots firs, all above
60 years old, near the houses of Keith-hall and Balbithan;
but too little, of any other kind of wood, in this district.
What there is, consists of elm, black cherry, larix, spruce and
Scots pine.  A few apple trees, and some pears and cher-
