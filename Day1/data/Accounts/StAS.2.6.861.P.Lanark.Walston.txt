ture 1083; occupied by plantations about 38.  The highest
rent obtained for land is for the crofts at Elsrickle, which are let
in lots of from 3 to 8 acres at L, 2, 8s. per imperial acre.  On
the other hand, there is some arable land so low as 5s. per acre,
About 100 acres have been added to the arable land within the
last twenty years, partly by improving moss, and partly by drain-
ing the land which used to be overflowed by the Medwin, before
it was diverted from its manifold windings into the straight chan-
nel cut for it in 1829.
   Draining has been extensively performed, but much still remains
to be done.  The improved mode of furrow-draining is beginning
to be practised, for which excellent stones of a suitable size can
be readily obtained.  The greater part of the land being uninclos-
ed, it cannot be cultivated so minutely or regularly, as it might be
if subdivided by good fences.  In general, tillage is well perform-
ed, and a rotation suitable to the different varieties of soil is ad-
hered to.  The best land is cropped in a course of six shifts, while
the worst is kept in pasture or broken up only when it has become
fogged, put through a course of cropping, and again laid down in
grass.  Twenty-seven ploughs are at present emploved, but their
number is likely soon to be reduced, as the farmers find that the
land pays better in pasturage for cows or sheep, than in white crop,
and the recent late harvests have confirmed them in this opinion.
   Live-Stoch.-The dairy stock is chiefly of the Ayrshire breed; *
there being also a cross of this with the short horns.  The ma-
nagement of the dairy is well understood, and practised.  Butter
and cheese are both made on some farms, but the making of full
milk cheese, of the Dunlop and Stilton varieties, is becoming more
general, and what is made here, equals, if it does not excel the
same kinds made in the districts from which they take their name.
This is proved by the premiums of the Highland Society which
have been awarded to individuals in this and the neighbouring pa-
risbes.
