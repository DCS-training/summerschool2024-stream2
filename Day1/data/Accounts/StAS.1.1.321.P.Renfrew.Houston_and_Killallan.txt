     of Houstoun and Killallan.

   It has not been customary to keep a register of burials in
the parishes of Houstoun and Killallan.

   The old village of Houstoun was built near the church and
mansion-house, and consisted of about 16 families.  All the
houses in it belonged to the proprietor.  There was not a
feu in the whole parish.  It was demolished when the New
Town was built, as was formerly observed, only one house
and the schoolhouse being left standing.  In the new village are

a large, elegant, modern house, and made a fine appearance

sold the remainder.  This estate was formerly the property
of the Porterfields of Fullwood, cadets  of the Duchal family.
The new village of Houstoun is nearly built; the front walls
are of hewn stone from the mansion-house and tower of
Houstoun.  There are five corn-mills in this parish, two lint
and fulling-mills.

   Trades and Manufacturers-The principal trade in the vil-
lage is weaving.  There are 42 looms, most of which are
employed in weaving cotton, muflins, lawns, and silk gause:
There are also a few carpenters, taylors, and shoemakers.  Near
