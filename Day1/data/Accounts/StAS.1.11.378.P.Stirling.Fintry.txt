   Proprietors and Rent.-The whole property of the parish
is vested in the Duke of MONTROSE, and Mr. SPIERS of Cul-
cruich; the former of whom is patron of the parish, and the
latter is the only residing heritor.  The present rent is between
1500 L. and 1900 L.; but it may be expected to rise consider-

   Church, etc.-The church was built before this century:
Part of it appears to be of a very ancient date.  The manse
was built in 1732, and has undergone several repairs.  The
stipend consists of 44 bolls of meal, 5 bolls of bear, and 24 L. 10 s.

supplies are adequate to their wants; insomuch, that there is
not, nor has been for many years past, a single instance of a
poor person, belonging to the parish, going out to beg.  This
attention to their own poor, however, does not by any means
free the inhabitants from the burden and plague of mendicants
from other place.  Crowds stock thither, from the great
towns and populous villages, for the space of 30 miles round,
who frequently repay the charity they receive, by making
nightly depredations upon their humane landlords.

   Fuel.-The fuel which has been principally used hitherto
