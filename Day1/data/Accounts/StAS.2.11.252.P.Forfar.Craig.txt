were to be seen, about twenty years ago, the remains of an earthen
fort, in the form of a square, each side of which was about 50 feet;
the walls 16 feet thick, and formerly as high or higher than a
man's head. Within it there was a house for the purpose of af-
fording shelter to the men, and holding stores and ammunition.
Without the square, and facing the mouth of the river, there was
a breast-work of earth, where cannon had been planted to defend
the entrance of the river. Tradition reports that it had been
made use of in Oliver Cromwell's time; but whether erected by
him, or in more ancient times, cannot now be ascertained. At
this fort some cannon were placed so late as the year 1745."*
    Modern Buildings.--The modern buildings are, the parish
church, built in the year 1799; the house of Rossie in 1800; the
house of Dunninald in 1825; the house of Usan in 1820; the
villa of Inchbrayock in 1813.
   These are all constructed, as to the mass of the walls, of a stone
found in the parish, called scurdy-stone; but the fronts and more
ornamental parts are built with freestone from quarries in the vi-
cinity of Brechin, or in the county of Fife.

				III.--POPULATION.
	   The population in 1801, amounted to               1328
                             1811,                           1465
                             1821,                           1545
                             1831,                           1552
   There has been rather a diminution of the population in the
more landward parts of the parish, in consequence of the demoli-
tion of many cottages and hamlets; and it is principally in the
fishing villages that the increase has, taken place. Several of
those families, also, who were removed from their cottages, instead
of leaving the parish, found a residence on Rossie island, adjoining
to the town of Montrose, and which portion of the parish, as now
included within the burgh of Montrose by the boundary bill, will,
in a few years, become a sort of suburban appendage to that town.
	The number of the population residing in villages is as follows.
1. In Ferryden,                                                              679
   In Usan,                                                                  142

                                      50 and 70,                             211
