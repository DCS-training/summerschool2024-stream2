   But Fordun, (vol. ii. p. 99.) when speaking of a remark-
able siege which the town sustained from the Norwegians,
in the time of the Picts, during which the Scots joined with
the Picts in repelling the enemy, says, " I have found, in
"some old writs, that the town of St John, now called
"Perth, was anciently called Bertha."

Tay, were called the Horestii.
   Whether, before the Romans invaded the country, there
were any constant or occasional assemblage of the people, in
dwellings erected for them, where Perth now stands, cannot
perhaps at this distance of time be determined with any cer-
