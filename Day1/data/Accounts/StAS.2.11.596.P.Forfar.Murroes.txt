they receive occasional supplies in cases of emergency, and al-
ways an annual sum for coals. It may be added, that the kirk-
session is extremely willing to lend a helping hand to deserving
individuals or families involved in temporary difficulties. The
poor certainly discover much less disinclination to seek for paro-
chial relief than a former times. Still the spirit of independence
is not wholly extinct. There are no assessments for the ordinary
poor. The heritors defray the expense of supporting an insane
man who lives with a private family. They also contribute L.10
Sterling yearly towards the payments of the board of a pauper iu-
natic in the asylum at Dundee. The deficiency is supplied from
the ordinary funds. Annual amount of collections for the benefit
of the poor, L.27; dues of morcloth, L.3, 10s,; seat rents, L.7,
11s.; interest of a capital of L.100, L.4, total L.42, 1s.
        Alehouse.-The parishioners, generally speaking, show no dis-
position to encourage the multiplication of public houses. There
are only two in the parish, which are frequented chiefly by wayfar-
ing people.
        Fuel.-The fuel principally in use is English coals, imported at
Dundee or Broughty Ferry.
