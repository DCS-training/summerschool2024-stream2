	Carpet Manufactory.--A very extensive manufactory of carpets
is carried on at the village of Crawick-mill. There are at work-
30 looms of the newest and most approved construction, with all
the other machinery required for preparing the yarn, as dyeing,
carding, spinning, warping, &c. The number of persons employ-

girls, in all 123. They work generally about ten hours per day,
earn on an average 12s. per week, and appear to be in a comfort-
able condition. They manufacture annually about 4000 stones
