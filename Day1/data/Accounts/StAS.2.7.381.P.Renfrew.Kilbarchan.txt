     by a constant intercourse of all ages and both sexes, with the
     warehouses whence work is to be obtained.. The parish teacher's
     salary is the maximum.
        At Linwood, there is a school that has long been taught with
     eminent success,-and it is gratifying to add, that measures are in
     progress for securing the means of religious worship, as well as
     the opportunity of a sound education, to the people resident in
     this remote district of the parish.

        Poor and Parochial Funds.- As this must, at all times, consti-
     tute a deeply interesting object of statistical enquiry, it is with re-
     gret we have to say, that there is but little room left for entering
     minutely into this topic.  A keen spirit of privateering was excited
     in this place during the ill-fated, though protracted war with our
     American colonies; and the disastrous issue of that enter
     addition to other circumstances, left so, many families destitute, that
     the ordinary funds which here, as elsewhere, had been gradually on
     the increase, were speedily exhausted by unexpected demands; and
     be oul resource left was to resort to assessment; which accord-
     ingly was resorted to first in 1785, and has ever since continued to
     be the ordinary means of providing for the demands and necessities
     of the poor. The following is a  state of the expenditure during
     the last half century.
