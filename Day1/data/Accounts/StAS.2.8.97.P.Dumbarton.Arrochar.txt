                 II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

  Land-owners.-Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, Dart. is proprie-
tor of almost the whole parish. The only other (and the only re-
sident proprietor) is John MIMurrich, Esq. of Stuckgoun, whose
property, though not extensive, is one of singular beauty and values
Parochial Registers.-There are no parochial registers of a more
remote date than 1761. They are Dot voluminous, and have not
been particularly well kepL
  Within these few years a number of houses have been erected
for sea-bathing quarters; for which Arroebar presents excellent
opportunities.

The population of Arrocbar in 1755 amounted to 466
                              1791-, . . 379
                              1831,334 males,226 females.
                                     Total   500.
The population has, of late, increased considerably. This arises
from Arrocbar baving been of late years divided into smaller farms,
and from the number of feus that have been taken. So lately as
1817, the land was almost all in the hands of one individual.
  The yearly average of births for seven years may be s tated at
12, marriages 3. No register of deaths has been regularly kept.

There are 105 families; 96 inhabited houses, and 6 uninhabited
houses, at least for one part of the year; but three of these are
usually occupied during the summer season. There are no fatuous,
deaf, blind, or dumb persons in the parish.
  English and Gaelic are generally understood; but while there
are no individuals that cannot speak and understand English, there
is a considerable number that have no acquaintance With Gaelic.
Within the last forty years, Gaelic has rapidly lost ground, and will,
ere long, as in other parts 'of Dumbartonshire, be known here only
as a matter of bistory.
   The inhabitants are shrewd, moral, and professedly religious
Poaching in game and salmon fisheries are now almost unknown.
