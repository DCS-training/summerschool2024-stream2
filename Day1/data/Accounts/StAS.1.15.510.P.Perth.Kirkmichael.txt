   Climate, Soil, Crop.-The country being more elevated
than Athole, on the one hand, and Marr on the other, and
being in general open and unsheltered, the climate is colder
than in either of these districts, and more exposed to the se-
verity of a cold or stormy season.  During nine months of the
year, frosts are frequent, and sometimes fatal to the fruits of
the earth.  In 1791 and 1792, the crops suffered extremely
from severe frosts, in the beginning of Autumn.  The air,
however, is pure and favourable to health and longevity.  It
ia not uncommon to see men pursuing their ordinary occu-
pations at 80 or 90 years of age.  Within these few years, a
woman died in the parish upwards of 100 years old.  Chro-
nical distempers are rare.  The small pox has been often fa-
tal.  Inoculation, though not unknown, is far from being ge-
rally practised.
   The soil on the banks of the Ardle, is thin and dry, having
a sandy bottom, and yields in general light crops.  In the
higher grounds, it is wet and spungy, unfriendly to vegeta-
tion, except in dry warm seasons, when it yields a pretty good
crop.  The same description applies to the soil of Glenshee,
and of the Black-water district.
   The produce of the ground is seldom sufficient to supply
the inhabitants.  The culture of potatoes is of the greatest
utility, as it is commonly the most productive crop.  The
kinds of grain generally sown are Cheshire bear, the com-
mon white oats, and a kind called barley oats.  Flax, and
pease, also, are grown, but in no great quantities, as the soil
or climate is unfavourable to them.  Field turnips have been
lately introduced, and answer well, of which the tenants ap-
pear to be sensible.  Some grass seeds have been sown; but
as the season for vegetation is short, the farmer can seldom
cut down more than one full grown crop of grass.  Sheep
