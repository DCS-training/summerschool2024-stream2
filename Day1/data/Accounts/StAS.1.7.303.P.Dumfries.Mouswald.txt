much improved within these 40 years; and a change to the
better seems to have taken place in the minds of the inhabitants,
who can now laugh at the superstition and credulity of their
ancestors, who, it is said, could swallow down the absurd
nonsense of a boon of shearers, i. e. reapers, being turned in-
to large grey stones, on account of their kemping, i. e. stri-
ving.  These stones, about 20 years ago, after being blasted
with gun-powder, were used in building the farm-houses then
erecting near the spot, which had formerIy been part of a
common.

   The higher grounds afford the most extensive prospect
that is to be met with in the south of Scotland.  From thence
one has a full view of the Solway Frith, and many of the
ports both on the English and Scotch side of it; the Isle of
Man, and many of the neighbouring counties, the greatest
part of Dumfries-shire, Galloway, part of Lanarkshire,
Peebles-shire, Northumberland, and Cumberland, in Eng-
land.  At the western extremity of the parish, a person may
stand on a particular spots and throw a stone into each of the
four neighbouring parishes, Torthorwald, Dumfries, Carla-
verock, Ruthwell, and this parish, all terminating on the side
of the small river Lochar, near that point.
