this is the case with all other kinds of provisions.-The valu-
ed rent of this parish is 7436 l. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch, and its real
rent may be from 5000 L. to 6000 L.  The highest price gi-
ven for land is 2 L. per acre.
   Manufactures are in a thriving state, there being two ex-
tensive bleachfields, 1 barley, and 2 meal mills, and 4 paper
mills, besides a fifth lately erected.  It is about 50 years since
the first paper mill was built in this parish; and, within these
30 years, the number of people employed in this manufac-
ture has increased from 30 or 40 to about 260: These, with
the tradesmen and labourers occasionally employed, receive
and circulate in the parish above 3000 L. annually, besides a
considerable sum given for coal.  The rags consumed weigh
above 300 tons; and the duties paid to the revenue a-
mount to above 1800 L. yearly.  Mr Simpson, proprietor of
2 of the mills in this parish, has the merit of being the first
paper manufacturer in this country who has applied the li-
quor recommended by Berthollet in his new method of bleach-
ing to the purpose of whitening rags.  He has erected an ap-
paratus for preparing this liquor, which, by the addition of
some new ingredients, he makes without its offensive smell,
and uses it in the common paper engines (as has been done
for some time in Ireland,) without retarding the operation,
or doing any injury to the steel.  This improvement, it is
thought, will add much to the quality and beauty of the pa-
per.   He has also the merit of bringing into use in this coun-
try, the drying of paper by means of flues on the principle
of hot houses, which must contribute much to Forward this
branch of the business during the winter season.  Some ex-
periments are just now making at his mill, and with great
hopes of success, for heating the vats on a new plan, which
will have many advantages over the present method, parti-
cularly in point of cleanliness and saving of coal.
