rests, and conser a signal favour on their tenants.  In good
policy these ought to be abolished, and long leases given,
with sufficient encouragement to open up and employ such
sources of manure as the parish affords.  In the mean time,
the industrious tenant may be take himself to other resour-
ces.  Several of the farms have the command of water.
Lime may be had at Huntly, but whether in sufficient
quantity for the purposes of agriculture, is doubtful.  At
the limekilns, however, it may be purchased in any quan-
tity, and at a cheaper rate, but at a greater distance. The
heritors have been long in the custom of using it on those
fields which were to be laid down with grass-seeds, and
have ever found it beneficial.  But the tenants in general
never use lime nor sow grass-seeds.-Their fuel, as the
mosses are near, is easily procured; and, comparatively
speaking, with little trouble and expense.  In summer
there are many annual fairs at a convenient distance for
felling their cattle and sheep.  Huntly affords a good week-
ly market for cheese, butter, beef, mutton, fowls, and most
other articles which the farmer can spare. Bear finds
ready vent at the numerous stills in the neighbourhood.
And when the demand for meal ceases at Huntly, it may
be carried to Aberdeen, where there is a ready market
and good prices.  The distance is much greater, but the
price generally compensates it.  The accommodation is
good, and the road, since the bridge was built over the
Don at Inverary, perfectly safe.  Besides Aberdeen has
this advantage over Huntly, that all those things which are
either convenient or useful to the farmer, may be bought
in it on the best terms, and in any quantity; and therefore
his small stock of necessaries is generally purchased there*.
