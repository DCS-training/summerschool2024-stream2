     Statistical Account

   Lord Findlater was also the first who introduced, on a
large scale, the practice of sallow, and the use of lime, sow-
ing grass-seeds, turnip and other green crops; improvements
now generally adopted, and with great success.  His Lord-
ships's improvements, with the general mode of farming
practiced in this corner, will be found more fully detailed 
in the Agricultural Reports of this county.

   Farms.-The farms most remarkable for beauty, extent
and improvement, in this parish, are, Colleonard and Boin-
die Hills, belonging to lord Findlater, and Blairshinnoch,
the property of Lord Banff.  The first of these was one of
Lord Findlater's experimental farms.  It lies on a gentle
declivity, opening to the south, and commands a variety of
pleasing prospects.  The fields are laid out with much taste
and judgment, inclosed and subdivided with hedge-rows
and belts of thriving wood.  It bears a striking resemblance
to a fine English farm, and to those who remember its for-
mer appearance, it seems altogether a new creation. The
farm of Blairshinnoch contains about 400 acres, and is ge-
nerally a productive field.
   Boindie Hills is chiefly occupied as a sheep farm, and
proves a very lucrative possession to Mr Milne, affording
excellent pasture to a flock of 200 to 300 sheep, chiefly of
English breed, and of the largest size.
   Nor, in this account, must we omit the little farm of
Cowden Knows*, distant about a mile from the town, and
justly celebrated for its rural beauty.
   Attracted by its wild and simple scenery, the present te-
nant has chosen this ferme ornee as a summer retreat.
