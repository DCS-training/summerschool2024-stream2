on the north side of the mount are rather earlier than those
much less elevated to the eastward along the foot of the Pent-
lands.  But while it is thus sheltered from easterly winds, it
is exposed to the south-west and south winds whi6 blow at times
down the vale of Clyde with the violence of a hurricane; and also
to those from the west and north-west, which bear on their wings
the vapours of the Atlantic, and ascending the hollow course of
the Clyde and Medwin, sweep almost unobstructed from one end
of the parish to the other.  The moisture, however, which the
west winds bear along, is in part averted from this parish by the
range, of which Tinto and Culter Fell form the summit, and
partly by the high lands to the westward of Carnwath.  The
following are the mean heights of barometer, &C. at the manse
for three months of the current year.

The barometer was kept in a room where there war frequently
a fire.  The detached thermometer hung in the open air in the
western corner of a window looking north-west.
   The climate is favourable to health and longevity, the best evi-
dence of which is found in the comparatively rare visits of epide-
mic diseases, and in the advanced age which many of the pa-
risbioners have reached in a hale and active state.  Within the
last twelve years, not less than nine individuals have died aged
eighty and upwards; and there are still living, and in the en-
joyment of good health and spirits, in the village of Walston,
twin sisters who have reached the age of eighty-four.  In
the village of Elsrickle there resides a lively and contented ve-
teran of the age of eighty-three, who crosses the hill with all the
agility of youth; and in the parish of Linton, a venerable
patriarch, at the age of ninety-three, who left this parish in 1835,
having spent sixty-six years of his Iife in it, sixty of which he
passed in the vale of Medwin as a shepherd on the farm of Bor-
land.  Having brought up and established in life a considerable fa-
mily, he is now living in his old age in comfort on the remainder
of the fruits of his industry and economy.  He was for many years
a member of the kirk-session of this parish, and still delights to
visit it, and to render his aid as an elder at the communion.
