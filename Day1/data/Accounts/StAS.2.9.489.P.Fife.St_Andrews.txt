sanctioned bv the Pope, who conferred on it the privilege of con
ferring degrees in the several faculties.
   From the monarchs of the country, the University and its col-
leges experienced all due encouragement. They confirmed their
several charters of erection, and they exempted the individuals
connected with them, whether masters or students, together with
their revenues, from all services and taxations, which might af-
feet the other subjects who were resident within the kingdom.
    Soon after the Reformation, it was deemed to be expedient, that
the University and its colleges should be modelled anew, so as
that they might be accommodated to the change which had taken
place in the religious establishment of the country; and by an
enactment of the Legislature in 1579, what is usually known by
the name of Buchanan's Reformation, because the celebrated
George Buchanan's was one of the commissioners employed in
drawing up the plan of the new arrangements, was carried into
effect. By the provisions of this act, the colleges of St Salvator
and St Leonard were to be restricted to the teaching of pbiloso-

process of time however, it was found, that the alterations which
had thus been effected, had given rise to uncertainty on the part
of the professors, relative to the sciences which they were required
to teach, and to a consequent negligence in the discharge of their
professional duties. To remedy this evil, a fresh enactment of the
Legislature in 1621, ratified the first foundations of the three col-
leges in all their heads, articles, and clauses, so far as was consist-

ordained the different members of the colleges to conform them-
selves to the regulations therein specified with the exception only,
that the masters of St Marv's College should confine themselves
to the teaching of divinity, as directed b the former Act of Par-
lialment.
    The three colleges, thus restored to their original foundations,
continued to subsist until the year 1747, when, in consequence of
the inadequacy of the provision for the principals and professors
of the two philosophy colleges, an union of them, which had for
some time been contemplated, was carried into effect by an act of
the British Parliament ratifying the measure, and embracing a de-
tail of the regulations by which the future arrangement of the
United College of St Salvator and St Leonard's were to be con-
ducted. By the statue, the number of the endowments was con-
