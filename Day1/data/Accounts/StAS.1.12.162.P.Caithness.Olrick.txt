retarded in their progress by wind or tide.  Murkle Bay is, 
in fact, within the Bay of Dunnet, and is, on that account, 
possessed of additional tranquillity, from its connexion with
tha latter, and farther removed from their stormy associates 
the Pentland Frith, with which both are connected.  In Dun-
net Bay, however, besides the anchoring ground, the pressure 
of both wind and sea into it, is often so great, that a vessel 
runs the risk of unavoidable destruction, by entering it.  In
Murkle Bay, the anchoring ground is a blue tenacious clay,
and has the character from seamen of being as good as is to 
be found in most places. The bay extends inland from Dun-
net Bay about 2000 yards; its breadth across is about 1500
yards.  At full sea it is not less than 5 fathom deep, where 
vessels anchor, and at low water about 4 fathom; from the 
shelter it now receives from Holburnhead on the W., and 
from Dunnethead on the N., it is believed to be calmer in a
storm than any part of the whole coast.  A pier, in conse-
quence of the immediate vicinity of a quarry, and all requisite 
materials, might be constructed at no considerable expense.
On these accounts, it is recommended to the particular notice 
and consideration of the friends of navigation, and lovers of 
their country, that the subject may be further examined, and 
the truth known.

   Minerals.-Limestone and freestone, grey flates of a light
durable kind, and blue flags, abound in this parish.  The 
flags are uncommonly good, are from 1 to 6 inches thick,
and may be raised of almost any extent of superficies: they bear
fire, and, from trials already made, are said to be capable of 
receiving a polish little inferior to marble.  Considerable 
quantities of these flags have lately been sent to Aberdeen,
and they have been found to answer the different purposes 
for which they were intented so well, that several cargoes of
