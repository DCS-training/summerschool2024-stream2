The two oldest papers of any note in Edinburgh are the Cou-
rant and Mercury. The former was established some short time
before the year 1710; for in that year liberty is granted by the
town-council to the celebrated Daniel De Foe to publish it, in
room of the deceased Adam Bog. The Mercury was conducted
by Thomas Ruddiman, A. M. Both papers were at first of small
size, and contained a few local advertisements and meagre para-
graphs of news.
   For a long period the Edinburgh newspapers were merely com-
pilations from the London prints, and seldom ventured on any
original speculations, especially of a party political nature. Now,
however, the Edinburgh, and indeed the greater proportion of
the Scottish newspapers, are conducted with much talent.
The following is a state of the circulation of the Edinburgh news-
 papers for the last three years, 6th January 1840 to 5th Ja-
 nuary 1843.

   The Edinburgh Gazette is published by authority every
Tuesday and Friday. The North British Advertiser, devoted
entirely to advertisements, is published every Saturday, and cir-
culated gratis to the extent of 19,000. A supplement to this pa-
per, containing articles of news and literature, is also published
every Saturday.
   In 1832, the Messrs Chambers commenced a cheap weekly pe-
riodical confined strictly to popular literature and science. This
journal has now an extensive circulation in all parts of Britain.
Several other cheap works by the same publishers have, obtained
a very extensive circulation. Indeed the weekly quantity print-
ed works, amounting to a quarter of a million of sheets, issuing
from this establishment, which circulate to every town, village, and
hamlet in Britain, is unprecedented in the annals of literature.
