   Projected Union of the King's and Marischal Colleges.-The
union of the King's and Marischal Colleges of Aberdeen has
often been projected; but various causes have hitherto pre-
vented it from taking place.  In 1747, the members of both
Colleges proposed a scheme, which they had concerted for
that purpose; but the magistrates of Aberdeen determined to
oppose it, unless it should be previously agreed upon, that
the seat of the United College should be fixed in Aberdeen.
Another scheme in 1754 was brought to a considerable de-
gree of maturity.  It was proposed to incorporate the funds
of both societies into one common stock, so as to answer the
following purposes: 1st, To make proper endowments for as
many professors as the funds could support.  2dly, To pro-
vide lodging for the masters and students.  3dly, To make
the discipline and education as perfect as might be.  And,
4thly, To do this in such a manner as might not be detri-
mental to the present incumbents, or to the common re-
venue.
   Insuperable difficulties again occurred in determining the
seat of the united College; and the whole plan was suffered
to fall to the ground at that time.  Other schemes of union
proposed in 1770 and 1786 shared the same fate.
