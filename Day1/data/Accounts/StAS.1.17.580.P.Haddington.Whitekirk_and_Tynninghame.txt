     Statistical Account

   On the top of Whitekirk hill there is a cairn, which is
said to be the burial-place of two young men, who were killed
by a detachment from the garrison of the Bass at the time of
the Reformation.  The people, with a very few exceptions,
are sober, honest, and industrious; their dress and mode of
living are much altered within these 20 years.  The roads
are tolerably good, and much improved of late.  For several
years preceding 1794, with a view to lessen the number of
crows, which in this parish and neighbourhood destroy a
vast quantity of grain, the farmers affected themselves in so
much a plough, and appointed a person to pay, from the
common stock, a penny for each old crow's head, and a half-
penny for a young one: The effects of this scheme are now
very perceptible, as the number of crows is now greatly re-
duced.
