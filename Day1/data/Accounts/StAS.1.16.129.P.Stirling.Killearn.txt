   It would appear, from the following letter, that this contract was
not disadvantageous to Mr Grahame:

   Sir, Balikinrain, May 25 1743.

   Notwithstanding of the contract entered unto betwixt several gentlemen
of the shyres of Stirling and Dumbarton, you and I, annent keeping of a
watch, whereby you was to pay yearly four per cent. of valuation; yet I
now agree with you for three per cent. for the lands you have contracted
for; and that for the first term of Whitsunday, and in time comeing du-
ring the standing of the contract.  And I am, Sir, your most humble
servant.

   Leaving the reader to make what reflections on this curious contract
he pleases, I shall only observe, that Mr Grahame, in this affair, is to be
considered as a more successful keeper of the peace, defender of justice,
and guaranteeing power, than most who have assumed these characters;
for by his activity and vigilance, in a few years, justice, honesty and
peace were, in this part of the country, established on a firm and lasting
foundation, and continue to operate without the aid of contracts,
watches, or guarantees.
