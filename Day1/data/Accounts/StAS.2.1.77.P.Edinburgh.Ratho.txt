a couple of miles, a ridge, or rather a succession of eminences
of table-land, crowned with stripes and clumps of trees, which
add very much to the beauty of the scene. From the whole
of this ridge, which averages from 300 to 400 feet in height,
the view is extensive and highly picturesque.* We believe there
are few spots in Scotland where such a prospect can be obtained
with so little exertion. From the South Platt Hill, which is a few
minutes walk from the manse, there is a distinct view of portions
of at least ten different counties; some say of no fewer than four-
teen. The Pentlands circumscribe the prospect to the south, but
from the east round to the south-west, the eye ranges over the cul-
tivated plains of the Lothians, the Frith of Forth with the adja-
cent coasts of Berwick and Fife, the counties of Kinross, Clack-
mannan, Lanark, and Stirling, and the giant rampart of the
Grampians from Benvoirlich to Benlomond. In a clear state of
the atmosphere, the view to the west is truly grand; but on an or-
dinary day, the immediate view of the surrounding parishes, and
particularly of Edinburgh with its environs will well repay the slight
labour of ascent to one who possesses the smallest taste for the
beautiful in nature.
   From the Calder road, to which this ridge descends, the land
again rises with a gradual ascent, till it reaches its greatest altitude
in the two rocky eminences called the Dalmahoy and Kaimes hills.
These two insulated hills, it may remarked, rising from the east,
terminate abruptly to the west in the manner of Salisbury Crags,
and the similar eminences with which Stirling and its neighbour-
hood abounds, as if at a distant period they had been washed by
some great western tide.

certained by actual survey. It is copied from a map of the parish executed by J.
