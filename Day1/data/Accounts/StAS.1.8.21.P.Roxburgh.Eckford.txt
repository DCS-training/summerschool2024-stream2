Celtic, the ancient language of the whole island.  The origi-
nal names of many places in Scotland are still retained, with
occasional alterations, probably introduced by the Dano-Saxon
dialect.  It is said to signify in the Gaelic the Horse Ford.  A
ford is commonly known to be a shallow part of a river pro-
per for passage; accordingly, at no great distance from the
manse, there is a very safe ford across the river Tiviot from
S. to N.
   The extent of the parish from N. to S. is six miles and 3 1/2
furlongs in length, and from E. to W. 4 1/2 miles in breadth.
It lies in the latitude of 55degree 32', and longitude of 10 degree 6' west
of London, according to Mr. Stobie's map of the county,
published in 1770; (69 1/2 statute miles to a degree).  The form
is triangular, or nearly approaching to it.  It is seperated by
Tiviot, opposite to the church, from the barony of Ormiston.
The water Kail runs through it from S. to N. and is emptied
into Tiviot, a little to the east of the church.  It is nearly at
an equal distance of 4 1/2 miles from Jedburgh and Kelso.

   Soil, Surface, Climate and Diseases.-Upon the banks of
the river Tiviot (which runs from west to east through the
county, and empties itself into the Tweed at Kelso), the soil
is generally light loam, rising in gentle eminences southward.
It has been originally covered with heath, but by proper cul-
tivation, is now rendered green and fit for pasture.  There
are no remarkable hills in this district, nor any waste lands,
except Cavertoun Edge, which has been of late chiefly devoted
to the annual horse races; although even some part of that spot
is in cultivation.  Part of Woodend Hill has been lately
planted with firs, and within a few years will afford a beau-
tiful landscape.  The air here is dry and salubrious.  Seldom
any epidemical diseases prevail, excepting the ague, which
