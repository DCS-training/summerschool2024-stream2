                               SUTHERLAND.

                THE REV.  CHARLES THOMSON, MINISTER.


                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
      Name.-The vocable wic in Danish, Saxon, and other northern
languages of Gothic origin, signifies a corner, a flexure, a bending'
reach in a river, a bay.  Hence the derivation of Wick, formerly
spelled Weik, which has always been the name of this parish, is
obvious.  A well-defined and rather beautiful little wic, or bay,
which, no doubt, formed a comparatively safe and commodious
harbour to the Danish and Norwegian pirates. * of ancient days,
communicated its appellation to the village which gradually rose
on its northern shore; and, finally, the name was extended to the
whole parochial district which, ultimately, became connected with
the town.
   Extent.-The parish of Wick is 15 1/2 miles in extreme - length
from north to south; its average breadth is about 5 miles; and its
superficial extent may be estimated at 77 square miles, or 61,600
imperial acres.
   Boundaries.-The parish of Wick is bounded, on the soutb by
the parish of Latheron; on the southwest, by the Parish of
Wattin; on the north-west, by the arish of Bower, on the
north, by the parish of Canisbay; and on the east, by the Moray
Frith.
   Coast-The coast of this parish presents along its line, which
is about twenty-six miles in lengt, a great variety of features. Near
the northern extremity, on the townland, or estate of Nybster, it
is formed, by lofty rugged rocks.  These are succeeded by gently
sloping fields, on the northern limit of the Bay of Keiss. Almost
he whole of the shore on ibe bosom of this capacious bay is low,

<FOOTNOTE>The nortitern pirates received the name of Vikingr, that is bay-men, because
they lurked in the wics, or bays. Wick is yet in use in the Scottish dialect, as the
wick o' the mouth, the wick o' the ee.
