   Miscellaneous Observations.--The arable land of the county lies
on an elevation of from 280 to 800 feet.  None of it, therefore,
is the best as to climate.  Yet it is a remarkable fact, that the
agriculture of this county is equal to any in Great Britain.  Wheat
abounds in the lower districts, and has been raised at the height
of 700 feet, to what would be called a good crop in the Lothians ;
and considerably higher, near to the head of Ettrick, oats, tur-
nips, barley, and clover hay thrive in regular rotation.  We could
wish much that the dwelling-houses and farm-buildings in this
county were as worthy of commendation as the agriculture skill
which is every where displayed in it.


<FOOTNOTE>  * In this enumeration are included those small parts of the parishes of Ashkirk,
Inverleithen, Peebles, Roberton, and Stow, which belong to the county of Selkirk,
The ratios, however, may be held to apply to the four parishes before described, as
forming the county of Selkirk.
