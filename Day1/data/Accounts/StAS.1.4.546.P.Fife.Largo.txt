ford.  There is a square tower pretty entire.  Of the old
house of Largo, one round tower remains.  A little south-
wards, in a large park, there is now an elegant modern
house, commanding one of the finest and most extensive
prospects in Scotland.  About a mile to the westward, is
the ancient tower of Lundin, which now constitutes a part
of a modern building, with a Gothic front.-  Near to this,
in the middle of a plain, are 3 remarkable stones, standing
upright in the ground, each measuring 6 yards above, and
as much it is supposed below the ground.  There are also
fragments of a fourth, which seems to have been of equal
magnitude with the other three.  There is no inscription,
nor the least vestige of any character to be found upon
them.  But the tradition is, that they are the grave-stones
of some Danish chiefs, who fell in battle with the Scots
near this place.
