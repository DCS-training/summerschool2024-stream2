ravock, has an elegant modern mansion house in this parish: the
property has been in the family since 1541.
   Hugh Davidson, Esq. of Cantray, has lately erected an elegant
mansion in a lawn, almostsurrounded on the south by the river Nairn.
The situation, though beautiful, is rather confined. Had the rising
ground on the north been chosen for a site, the view would have
been truly rich and variegated. Dalcross Castle was built by Lord
Lovat, in the year 1621. The situation is singularly grand, commanding
one of the most sublime and variegated scenes in the
kingdom; one interrupted view from Malfourvonie to the Ord of
Caithness, extending to about 120 miles. It was bought by Mackintosh
of Mackintosh, about the year 1702, since which time it
has been allowed to fall into decay. The walls are still perfectly
entire, and, in the bands of a man of taste and judgment, might, at a
comparatively little expense, be made one of the finest seats in the
north, instead of an eye-sore to every one that passes by.
   Leys Castle, a princely residence, built lately by Colonel Baillie,
is all that wealth, skill, and taste could render it. It stands
at an elevation of about 300 feet above the level of the sea, and commands
a most extensive view of mountain, dale, wood, and water.
The decorations correspond; and the grounds are laid out in the
most scientific and tasteful manner.

   Manners and Circumstances of the People.-Within the	last
twenty years, a remarkable change has taken place in the habits
and dress of the people; even at so late a period, it was the boast
of the housewife to clothe her husband andchildren, by the work
of her own hands. Spindles have vanished, and spinning-wheels
will soon be seen only in museums. Those who depend on the
profits of their farms are generally poor, alleging that the rent of
their lands is from IO to 30 per cent. above a remunerating price,
