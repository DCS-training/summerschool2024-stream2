     Statistical Account

   Flesh-Market.-This is well supplied with the various
articles in that line.  The meat was formerly ranged on
moveable stalls, at the cross; but is now more convenient-
ly disposed, in a place surrounded with high walls, and
defended from the injuries of the weather.
   The weekly market was anciently held on Saturday, but
is now transferred to Friday.  There are 6 sairs in the
year.  The chief of these is St. Magdalene's, on the 2d
of August.  The fairs here are not so much frequented
as formerly.  They were indeed once resorted to from
all parts of Scotland, and continued for several days.
   The rate of living is as high here as in the capital.
The price of beef and mutton often rises beyond it.  Veal
and pork may sometimes be had cheaper than in that
market.  Poultry of all kinds are not only dear, but
scarce.  This arises in part from the increased demand of
the neighbouring city; and still more from the diminu-
tion of cottagers, who furnished plentiful supplies of that
and many other articles connected with house-keeping.

   Fish.-The loch produces eels, pike, and perch, in their
respective seasons, though these are now said to have de-
creased.  Considerable quantities of eels are collared here,
and sent in that state not only to different parts of this
kingdom, but as far as London.  Trouts are also to be
had in the river Avon.

   Minerals.-Coals are the only fuel used either in the
town or country parish.  They are chiefly brought from
Borrowstounness and Grange collieries, and the E. part of

Torphichen.  The superiority of these houses in Linlithgow, one or two
only excepted in the deeds, was afterwards formally conveyed to the ma-
gistrates and council.
