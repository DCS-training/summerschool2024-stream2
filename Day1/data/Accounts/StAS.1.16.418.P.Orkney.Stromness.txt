parts of this county.  In holding this plough, the plough-
man bends to the soil, and may well be denominated cur-
vus arator, as Virgil does the Roman ploughman.  The
two stilted plough is used by a few, which answers best for
tilling oat-land, and the other for tilling bear-land.  They
till with three horses abreast; some till with two horses;
but few till with four horses.  Oxen are little used in til-
lage, but they are used for harrowing, and carting peats.
Harrows with wooden teeth are for the most part used;
a few use lion-teethed harrows.  Crebris insectabere rastris,
is an injunction which the farmers here do not much prac-
tice, as they think the soil cannot bear much harrowing,
and that it produces a short light crop.  They till rather
shallow, and rely more on the quantity of manure than on
any thing else, for raising a good crop.  Fallowing is rarely
or not at all used by the small farmers.  The first residing
heritor, William Wall, Esq; fallows a proportionable
quantity of his farm yearly, and consequently raises grain
of a superior quality; he is also making inclosures.  On
the upland farms, distant from the manure of sea-weed, a
spot of half an acre on each farm is laid lea, which they
plough before or after harvest, and sow it with bear the
following year; but as the weeds have generally shed
their seeds before this ploughing, it can be of little advan-
tage.  This, however, is all the rest the land has.

   Rotation of Crops.-If there was a proper rotation of
crops, the land might receive some rest by this means;

     "Sic quoque mutatis requiefcurt f‘tibus arva*."

But the constant rotation of crops, is that of oats and bear
in alternate succession.  Some spots have yielded crops of
