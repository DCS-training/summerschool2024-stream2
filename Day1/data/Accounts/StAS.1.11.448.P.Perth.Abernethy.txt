those watch towers on which the Picts used to kindle fires, on
sudden invasions, insurrections, or the approach of the ene-
my; these signals were communicated from tower to tower,
till the whole country was alarmed and flew to arms.  These
fires were attended with the blowing of horns, which was the
signal for war.  From this hill there is a most beautiful and
extensive prospect.  About a mile and a half E. from Aber-
nethy, a little below the mansion-house of Carpow, stood the
ancient castle which belonged to the Lords of Abernethy*;
part of its foundation may still be seen.  In the S. W. corner
of this parish, among the hills, stands Balvaird Castle, which
belonged to the MURRAYS of Balvaird, in the reign of RO-
BERT the IId.  It is now the property of the Earl of MANS-
FIELD, the lineal descendent of that ancient house.
