gular figure, and about 4 1/2 English miles in length, and near-
ly 3 broad.  It is rather hilly than flat; but there are no hills
in it of any considerable height.

   Rivers, Fish.-The Don, which is our only river, abounds
in excellent salmon.  The way in which they are caught
here, is by cruives, of which there are 2 belonging to Mr.
Burnett of Kemnay.  The salmon are sent fresh to Aberdeen
for exportation, and are sold to the merchant at 4 d. the pound,
from the beginning of the fishing season to the middle of
April, and thence, to the end of the season, at 3 1/2 d. the
pound.

   Soil.-The soil is, for the most part, a light mould, very
stony, and lying on a bed of sand.  The haughs, indeed, on
the banks of the Don, are, in general, a fine rich loam,
deep, and perfectly free from stones; but they are of no
great extent in this district.  We have here great abundance
of peat-moss, a considerable part of which has been in tillage
for ages, and is called Burntland.  It was heretofore the
practice to plough such grounds early in summer, and as soon
as the furrows were a little dried, to set fire to them; a prac-
tice of considerable advantage to the farmer for a few years
after the burning, but very ruinous to the soil.  Since this
practice was prohibited, the crops of oats on our mossy
grounds have been poor, and, in late seasons, are generally
lost.  But trees of all kinds thrive wonderfully in our peat-
mosses.  The late Lord Kaimes takes notice of this fact in
his Gentleman Farmer; but he states it inaccurately, and
draws a conclusion from it, which by no means follows.
