				PARISH OF

               	     NEW MONKLAND, OR EAST MONKLAND.

            PRESBYTERY OF HAMILTON, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

	        THE REV. JAMES BEGG, D. D., MINISTER.

                   I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE parishes of Old and New Monkland were formerly
one parish, under the general name of Monkland,--a name deriv-
ed from the monks of the Abbey of Newbottle, to whom the lands
belonged. The parish was divided into two in the year 1640,--
the eastern division being named New Monkland, and the western
Old Monkland.
	Boundaries, Extent.--The parish is in the middle ward of La-
narkshire, and forms a part of the north boundary of the county.
It is nearly ten miles in length from east to west, and seven in
breadth near the middle, but narrower at both ends; bounded on
the south by the parishes of Bothwell and Shotts; on the east
by those of Torphichen and Slamannan; on the north by those of
Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch; and on the west by those of
Cadder and Old Monkland.
	Soil and Climate.--The soil is various. That in the north and
west parts of the parish is the best, consisting partly of a strong clay,
and partly of a dry soil; which soils, when properly cultivated, are
capable of bearing any kind of crops. The middle and east parts
are of a mossy soil, and, in early seasons, yield good crops of oats,
flax, potatoes, and rye-grass hay; but in cold late seasons the oats
do not ripen well. There are no hills nor mountains in the pa-
rish, though the greater part of it is high. The highest lands are
in the middle of the parish, and run the whole length of it from
east to west, declining gently on each side to the rivers Calder and
Loggie, which are its south and north boundaries. These high
lands may be from five to six or seven hundred feet above the
level of the sea , and a great part of them are covered with mosses,
which in that elevated situation are not capable of improvement,
except at a very great expense.
