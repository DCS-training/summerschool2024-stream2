The rent of a house is from 12 s. to 20 s.  There is no
characteristical difference between the inhabitants of this and
the other parishes of Mid-Lothian.  If there be any ground
for animadversion, the abuse of spiritous liquors among the
lower ranks affords it.  Where such a habit prevails, the
health suffers, business is neglected, and poverty follows
of course.  These pernicious effects were not so common,
when ale and beer were more generally drunk.  It world
certainly then be an essential service to the community, to
impose such a duty on spiritous liquors, or to transfer it
from ale and beer to them, as would diminish the number
of low tippling houses, and bring back the people to the
safer use of malt liquor.
