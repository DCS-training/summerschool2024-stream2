when properly managed.  He took this farm, which consists
of nearly 100 acres arable, and about the same number of
pasture among natural wood, into his own hands only a few
years ago; he enclosed and subdivided it with stone-fences and
hedges, levelled and straighted the fields; trenched up balks,
and drained marshes; and now raises from it bear, oats, pease,

cannot be expected till they get leases upon their possessions.
But if ever they shall be brought to pay more attention to
their ground, I am certain a regard to their own interest will
make them persevere; for the climate is temperate, and the
soil, though thin, is early and fertile.  But while I accuse
the men of indolence, I should do great injustice to the wo-
men, if I did exempt them from the charge; by whose in-
dustry and diligence their families are in a great measure sup-
ported.  Their chief employment is spinning flax, sent up by
some manufacturers from Aberdeen, which brings a great deal
of money into the country.  During the summer months, ma-
