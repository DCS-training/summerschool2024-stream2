purpose of manure.  An extensive stratum of an excellent
millstone grit enriches the estate of Balglass, and supplies
the country to a great distance with millstones.  The quar-
ry began to be regularly wrought about 40 years ago; it
is now cut down to the depth of 24 feet, and can afford
stones of any size, and of 3 different qualities.  A very
thick stratum of soft freestone, the grit not fine, prevails in
all the lower grounds of the parish; its depth has not yet
been discovered.  It is of a red colour, but variegated with
blotches, and streaks of white and grey.  It is not of the
best quality for building, and affords no symptoms of any
valuable mineral in the vicinity.  Several trials, by boring
and shanking, have been made to find coal, but unsuccess-
fully; and I do not think that any where in the parish
the symptoms of that useful fossil are favourable.  Amongst
the stones in this parish may be mentioned a jasper, which
abounds in the banks of Enrick, and likewise in the pa-
rishes of Buchanan, Balfrone, and Fintry.  The colours are
brown, red and green intermixed, in the form of blotches
and ramifications; some nodules resemble the bloodstone,
whilst others contain a confiderable portion of the zoned
agate, which abounds in many places of Scotland.  The
jasper takes a fine polish, and has been cut into seals, but-
tons, etc.

   Climate.-The climate is wet and cold, but the air is not
insalubrious.  The inhabitants are not remarkably subject
to any epidemical disease.  Many of them live to a consi-
derable old age: There are four persons at present between
80 and 90 years of age.  John Buchanan of Provanstoun,
aged 104, died here anno 1792.

   Agriculture.-The most of the hilly part of the parish is
yet in a state of nature, having never been plowed; but
