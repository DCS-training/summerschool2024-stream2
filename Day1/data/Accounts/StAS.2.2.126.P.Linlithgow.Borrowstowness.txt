those of fragile and delicate appearance often dissolving in decay
may be looked for, while the surrounding woods and plantations har-
our the larger species, which are usually acrid or tufted. Among the
latter, Agaricus Piperatus, Volemum, Flexuosus, Vellereus, Adustus,
although not generally common, are abundant under Kinneil copse.
Of the former A. Sowerbei, a curious species, may be mentioned
as growing on the bank by the shore. The following list of Fungi
of different genera, gathered in the woods immediately around Kin-
neil, are allowed to be additions to the Scottish flora; the first nine
are likewise quite new to Britain. The names are chiefly those
of Fries and Berkeley.
   Several species, apparently undescribed, were met with; but, as
they have not yet been sufficiently examined, it is not judged proper
to publish them in this place. Although Fungi are obscure plants,
and little regarded, the subjoined list may be useful as a guide to
those who attend to such things in other parts of the country, be-
sides appearing necessary to complete this botanical view.

   As the various species of fungi are more generally distributed in
temperate regions, to which they are chiefly confined, than plants
of higher rank, owing, perhaps, to their greater simplicity of struc-
ture, it is very probable that all of the above might be found
throughout Britain wherever those circumstances chiefly required
for the production of the order, shade, and moisture exist. The
fungi of the continent, indeed, are in a great many cases iden-
tical with those of this country. To this law of comparatively ge-
neral distribution, there are, however, exceptions, and some of the
species appear to be very local, their diffusion depending upon
causes which are not understood. There is also a peculiarity con-

specimens of nearly all the Fungi to the Rev. Mr Berkeley, the best authority on
the subject in this country, who confirmed or determined the names of the species.
