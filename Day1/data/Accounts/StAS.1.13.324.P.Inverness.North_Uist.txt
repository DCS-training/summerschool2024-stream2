rolls of justices of the peace, none of them have under-
taken to act as such, for want of means ot enforce their
decisions, there being no prison nearer hand than Inver-
ness, which is at the distance of more than 100 miles.
They are indeed ignorant, for reasons already mentioned.
They are of a middle fize, there being neither dwarf, nor
any remarkable for height among them.  In their manners

   Methods of meliorating the Condition of the People.-Long
leases are certainly the best means that can be put in the peo
ples power to better their condition.  It is not to be supposed,
that without this encouragement, they will discover any
new exertion in industry, or be at the expense of introdu-
cing any new implements of husbandry, or give them-
selves the trouble of making any improvements that will
turn out to no advantage to them before the expiration of
their leases, which were only 9 years at their commence-
ment.  It will be said, in answer to this, that though
there were 19 years leases granted in the year 1769, there
has not been much done to improve the country.  But to
obviate this objection, it may be observed, that such as
were in the vigour of life at that time did a good deal in
that way, that the most to whom these leases were grant-
ed were people on the decline of life, attached to the old
method of farming, and ignorant of any other.  But the
cafe differs widley now:  The gentlemen who possess the
principal farms in the parish now are all young and ac-
tive, and discover a spirit for improvements.  They have
likewise, by their intercourse with the low country, ac-
quired a knowledge of the methods of cultivating the ground
there, which they are inclined to introduce in this country
upon proper encouragement.
