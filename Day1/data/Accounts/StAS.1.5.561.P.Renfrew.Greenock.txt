     of Greenock

   river Grise, which, rising in the western confines of the di-
strict of Kilmalcolm, runs through the southern part of the
parish of Greenock;  and increasing as it flows, by number-
less rivulets from the high grounds on both sides, glides,
in a winding direction, through a long strath or valley, to
which it gives name, and falls into the Black Cart, near
Paisley.-Along the coast, except where it has been cleared
by industry, it is shelvy, rough, and much incumbered
with large stones.  These stones, however, are not unpro-
ductive;  they yield annually a luxuriant crop of sea weed*,
which, though deemed interior in quality to drifted ware,
the neighbouring farmers cut, especially in the beginning
of May, and spread on the grounds they are preparing for
barley, with great advantage to the crop.

   Soil,-The soil, close upon the shore, is, in general, very
light, sandy, and full of gravel, requiring frequent showers
to produce tolerable pasture.  After rest, however, and the 
aid of a little manure in favourable seasons, sea ware, for
instance, of which from time to time, by strong westerly
and northerly gales, there is no small quantity thrown on
the shore, it produces very good crops of oats and barley;
and, (which annually becomes a greater object of culture),
large quantities of potatoes of the best quality.+  In the
ascent, to a considerable distance from the flat ground on
the shore, there occur soils of various kinds, earth, clay,
till, etc Farther up, and towards the summit of the hills seen

* It is surprising to observe, how soon to a bare stone, rolled from the
land into the sea, is covered with this vegetable.

+ The culture of potatoes in the neighbourhood of towns, by sedentary 
mechanics, contributes greatly to their health.  When potatoes, (which is
often the cafe at Greenock), are sold at 6 d. a peck, and good fresh her-
rings at 7 or 8 a-penny; what a blessing to poor families!
