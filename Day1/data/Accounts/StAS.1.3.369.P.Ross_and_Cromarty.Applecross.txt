     NUMBER LVI.

     PARISH OF APPLECROSS.

     (Country of Ross.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN M'QUEEN.

     Origin of the Name.

   APPLECROSS is a fanciful designation, assumed by one
of the proprietors of that part of the parish, from
which it derives its name.  In commemoration of this,
five apple trees were planted cross ways, and have since, in
form, been perpetuated by his successors.  The antient and
only name by which it is known in the language of the coun-
try, is Comrich, a Gaelic word signifying protection, a name
implying the immunity of the place in antient times, this
having been the seat of a cloister, and, as such, an asylum
for all, who either from persecution,or merited funish-
ment, sled for protection.

   Situation.-The figure of the parish is irregular, being fre-
quently interfected by the sea, and having, in the centre of
one of its most populous districts, a few farms which form
a part of the parish of Lochcarron.  It is situated in the
county of Ross, presbytery of Lochcarron, and synod of
Glenelg.
