hood has rather a tendency to prove, that money expended
in the cultivation of moor lands has seldom turned to a good
account, and that planting is the best mode of improvement;
the effects of water, however, has not been tried.  Lime o-
perates at first, but loses its effect as a stimulus upon a second
trial.  Though the appearance of moor lands may be chang-
ed by culture and artificial grasses, they will not feed well;
and, when wet or cold, are believed to lay the foundation of 
the rot in sheep, a distemper which proves extremely fatal.

   Two horses only, are at present used in the plough here,
instead of four oxen and two horses, which was formerly the
practice.  They will perform the same quantity of labour
equally well, and in much shorter time.  The English plough
is chiefly used in this parish.  The lands produce most of the
common vegetables, plants, and trees.  Artificial grasses are
much used.  Of late farmers here directed their atten-
tion, and with great success, to stock.  They find that the
lands in grass make a profitable return.  By feeding, too, the
ground is enriched for future crops.  The advantage of feed-
ing sheep on the lands, in the proper season, with turnip, is
sensibly felt; and this practice is supposed to be preferable to
a summer fallowing; and is, at the same time, no loss to the
farmer.

   Plantations of all kinds of trees are much encouraged by
the present proprietor of the estate of Ayton, which contri-
butes greatly to enrich and beautify the country.  His lands
