the river Nith, a little below the high way.  On the other
side of this river, the ground rises to a still greater height, and
a much wider extent, towards another range of far more
distant hills, the tops of which form the termination of the
prospect on the south.

   Climate, Soil, Cultivation, Cattle, and Produce.-From the
elevated situation of the parish, and the number and height
of its hills, the air is naturally moist and cold; sometimes
frosty early in harvest, and late in the spring; yet generally
pure, owing to the declivity of the ground, the rapidity of
the rivers and brooks, and the frequency of fresh breezes
and high winds.  As in other parts of the country, the soil
here is much diversified; consisting of light gravelly mould,
loam, clay, moss, and a mixture of moss and clay; and in
general it is cold, marshy, and deep.  There are above 600
acres in tillage.  Light land is tilled with the English plough
drawn by two horses, and deep land with the Scottish plough
drawn by four horses.  The mossy land requires to be very
early ploughed.  Seed time begins about the end of March,
and harvest work in the end of August.  Except two or three
farms from 40 l. down to 30 l of rent, and the hke number
of still smaller value, there are none entirely corn farms in
the parish; the rest being stocked with sheep, and all of
them with a proportion of black cattle.  The number of
the former will be about 13000; and of the latter above
700, old and young.  The best sort of sheep weigh from 50
to 60 lib. and the smaller kind from 38 to 45 lib. or more.
The rate of laying, or smearing them, is, 6 lib. of butter with
3 Scotch pints of tar for each score, which yield annually
between 50 and 60 lib. of wool.  The best kind of wool is
sold for 8 s. per stone, and the inferior sort for 5 s. or upwards,
to 6 s. 6d.  The grain and roots, chiefly cultivated here, are
