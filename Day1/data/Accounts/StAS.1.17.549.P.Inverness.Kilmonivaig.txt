   What credit can we give to the constant diminution of
the size of the human body, which authors are sometimes
fondly telling us of, when the arrow embrasures in this old
ruin, are not an inch higher, than what would render them
convenient for us even at this day?
   Another antiquity, which this parish can boast, is the fa-
mous parallel roads, one of the took stupendous monuments
of human industry, and which well deserve the attention of
the antiquary.  They are to be seen in the eastern part of
this parish, on the declivities of sheep and lofty mountains,
which extend for 7 or 8 miles on each side of the water of
Roy, in the direction of south west and north-east, and the
opening betwixt which forms the valley that goes under the
name of Glenroy There were originally 3 lines of these
roads on each side of the glen, each corresponding in height
to the one opposite to it; the lowermost, however, is in
some parts effaced, particularly on the south side.  They all
run parallel to each other, and in an horizontal direction,
humouring the windings of the mountains.  Their dimen-
sions are various; in general, they are from 60 to 70 feet in
breadth; and the distance betwixt two of them has been
found to be about 180.  Similar roads are likewise to be
seen in two of the adjacent glens, but not in such perfection.
   As there is nothing left upon record respecting the time
when, the persons by whom, or the purposes for which these
roads were constructed, we can only mention the common
traditions concerning them.  One is, that they were made
by the Kings of Scotland, when the royal residence was in
the castle of Inverlochy, which is not above 11 miles from
the nearest of them; and, what gives an appearance of truth
to this tradition, in the opinion of those who maintain it, is,
that the construction of these roads was so vast an underta-
king, as could not be effected by any vassal or nobleman,
