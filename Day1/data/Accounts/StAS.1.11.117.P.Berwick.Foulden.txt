sion of property took place; but since the lands were divided,
they have been in general well inclosed, and brought to a con-
siderable degree of cultivation.  They yield plentiful crops
of wheat, barley, oats, pease, turnips, potatoes, and grass.

   Rents, Cattle, etc.-Although these lands fully bear the
above description of soil and good quality, the best of them,
excepting some crofts, were let no higher than 10 s. per acre;
but since the old leases expired, they are now advanced from
10 s., to 20 s., 30 s., and even 40 s., which is not too high, con-

a large tract of land, on the north side of the parish, called
Foulden Muir, was occupied by the residenters in the village,
by way of stents, or pasture for cows and horses, and, in that
state, paid very little rent.  The grass of these grounds being
always in great plenty, and of good quality, suggested the

now pay about 300 L. of yearly rent.  Some part of this land
has been found unfit for husbandry, and is lately planted with
firs, which promise a good return in due time.  Lime is very
much used in this part of the country.  There is shell marl
in the parish, but it has never been properly tried; and, for
number of years past, it has been entirely neglected.  There
is nothing remarkable in the mode of husbandry, nor in the in-
struments employed in it.  The breeding or feeding of sheep
has not been tried here, although great part of the lands are
very fit for both purposes.  The late proprietor had a fine
taste for the breeding and feeding of cattle.  His horses were
the best in the country, and it is but 3 years since the last
