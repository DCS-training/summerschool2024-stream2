bounds of this parish, unless perhaps the ruinous tower of
Seafield, the ancient seat of the Moutrays, which stands upon
the sea-shore, about a mile to the eastward of Kinghorn; and
St. Leonard's tower, which stands in the middle of the town,
which in times of Popery was a place of worship, but is
now converted into a town-house and common prison, deserve
to be so called.  Glammis tower, a seat of our ancient kings,
already alluded to, is now no more; and as for the monas-
tery which stood somewhere about the bottom of the town,
there is not so much as a vestige of it to be seen, and even
the place where once it was, cannot be ascertained.  At a
litle distance from the ruins of Seafield tower, there is a 
large cave, which appears either to have been formed by
some violent concussion of the earth, or to have been exca-
vated by the sea, which has since retired.  There is the ap-
pearance of some kind of building having been once at its
entrance; but whether it had been thus fortified and secured
as a place of refuge from the sudden descents of the Danes
and Norwegians, with which this coast was formerly so much
infested, or, as a den for thieves and robbers, and as a place
for concealing their ill-got booty, we have not been able to
discover.  About half way between Kinghorn and the Petty-
cur*, close by the sea, there is a specimen of the Basaltes,
which well deserves the attention of the curious, who may
not have had an opportunity of surveying those more stu-
pendous works of nature of the same kind, the Giants Cause-
way, in the county of Antrim in Ireland, or the rock Pere-
neire near St. Saudoux in Auvergne, in France.  The Basal-
tic columns are of different diameters, with between 4, 5, 6,
7, faces.  They are, in general, about 12 or 14 feet in

of a mile from the town, to the S W.
