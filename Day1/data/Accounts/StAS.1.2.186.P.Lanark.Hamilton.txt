produce of barley is now scarcely three fifths of what it was
in their younger days; and the culture of it is almost aban-
doned, except for cleaning and preparing the land for the
reception of artificial grasses.
   The greater part of the parish produces good pease and
beans; the seeds of which are, for the most part, sown promis-
cuously, the one of the other kind preponderating more or less,
as the cultivator apprehends the soil and circumstances of the
case may require.  On the poorer land, pease are sown alone:
and, in favourable seasons, a considerable quantity of these kinds
of grain is produced and sent to market.  But the late unfa-
vourable years have been much more productive of straw than
of seed, and have tended greatly to discourage the culture of
these plants*.  Indeed there is no kind of crop, which more
frequently disappoints the expectation of the husbandman.
Wheat, and oats are now the grais on which the farmer
principally depends.   Wheat, coming forward early in the
season, fills and ripens, while the days are long and the fun
powerful.  Oats are of a very hard nature, and are brought to
maturity by a less degree of beat than the other ordinary field
crops require.  It is remarkable, that in some parts of this
parish, where the soil was firm, and the land lay sheltered
from the high winds, which prevailed during the summer of
that year, and loosened the roots of the corn in exposed pla-
ces, the oats were found to produce nearly as much meal, in
1790, as they used to do in the best seasons; though the ripen-
ing could scarcely be said to have commenced, till the mild wea-

*Some people, thinking they have observed, that barley, pease,
and beans have become less succesful, as the culture of artificial
grasses has become more prevalent, attribute the failure of these
kinds of grain to the introduction of eye-grass.
