prince a charter was obtained, confirming all the privileges
granted by himself or his predecessors.  Other charters were
given by James VI. of Scotland, and by Queen Anne.  The
town formerly sent a representative to the Scots parliament;
but, since the Union, it forms only part of a district; and in
conjunction with Glasgow, Dumbarton, and Rutherglen, e-
lects a member of the British legislature.
   The town is about half a mile in length, but in some places
so narrow, that it is with great difficulty two carriages can pass
each other.  There are some small streets and lanes in it,
besides the principal street.
   It is governed by a provoct, 2 baillies, and 16 counsellors.
The revenue amounts to about L. 360 per annum, and consists
of rents from lands, fishings, customs, a public ferry boat o-
ver the river Clyde, etc.  Its right to a salmon fishery on the
Clyde extends from Scotstoun to Kelly bridge, and yields an
income of L. 75 per annum.  The ferry was formery between
the King's-Inch and Blawert-hill, but is now removed about
a quarter of a mile farther down the river.  The place is
broader, and much more exposed to the weather, than where it
formerly was: But these objections are compensated by other
advantages.  There is now a ferry-house on each side of the 
river, the property of the town, and a most complete ferry-
boat, built by subscription, purposely for carriages; in which,
by means of a rope, fixed upon each side of the river, and run-
ning upon 4 rollers, two at each end of the boat, one placed
in a horizontal direction, and the other perpendicular, any
carriage, with a pair of horses, can be easily boated, and car-
ried over by one man in five minutes.  It is believed, that the re-
venue of this town , will, in a few years, be considerably en-
creased, by the change in the ferry, and this easy mode of con-
veyance.
   There are a good many salmon at times caught in the river,
