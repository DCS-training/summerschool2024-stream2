without an adequate allowance for the labour and expence,
with which it would be attended.  But the greatest discour-
agement of all is, the exorbitant advance upon the price of
labour, particularly servants wages, which in general are now
tripled, beyond what they were within the above period:
Especially, as this is connected with a nearly similar rise in
the price of horses, husbandry utensils, artificers work, and
wearing apparel; to say nothing of imposts for revenue and
roads, the rise of rents, and the expensive difference in the
present stile of living*.

*All this must bear very hard upon the corn farmer, and at
last quite overpower all his efforts in the unequal conflict; con-
sidering too that the price of grain is at this day much the
same that it was 20 or 30 years ago.  Thus circumstanced, how
can he but sink down under the incumbent weight of such at
combination of discouragement from every quarter?  And if he
fall, how can the landed proprietor stand, or the necessitous poor
live?  For, supposing matters to go on in this train, the con-
sequence is obvious: Agriculture must fall into decay, how far
no one can tell; the country will turn wild and barren, will be
desolated and depopulated; grain become scarce, and rise in
price beyond the reach of those who cannot work, or are not
employed; and the kingdom at large be reduced to want and
distress.  What else is to be expected, when the very money,
paid by the farmer and others, for statute labour and at toll-bars,
is employed against him to augment his hardships, by being
lavishly held out in tempting offers to his servants and labour-
ers, to entice them from his work, and induce them to go to
the making and repairing of the great roads; especially, when
the mineries, founderies, and the like great works, above all the
cotton manufactures, all around, particularly in the west, have
swept the country quite bare of hands, and seem as if they
could still keep it in the same situation?  For not only servants
and labourers, but likewise mechanics, of all sorts, are now re-
linquishing their respective occupations, and betaking themselves
to different departments in the cotton manufacture, or are em-
ployed in hawking, or otherwise extending, the sale of its vari-
ous articles all over the country.  This general desertion of
other employments, in favour of a particular branch of business,
is so remarkable, and so very singular, that it may well be ques-
