   barley, the ground is fown with grass feeds for a season or two.
When it is broken up it is fown again with oats, and afterwards'
put into fallow.  Turnip and potatoe crops are little used,
and even barley does not always succeed upon the clay foil.
The farmers have a ready market for their corn at Dalkeith.
which is held weekly through the whole year; and is, per-
haps, the greatest corn market in Scotland.-An acre of
good lands lets here at 25 s yearly.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-A few years ago, a silver pen-
ny, of Edward I. of England, was found in the glebe, and
is now in the possession of the minister.  It might, perhaps, have
been lost at the battle of Roslin, which was sought not far
from this.-Sir Alexander Ramsay, of Dalhousie, who lived
in the 14th century, is celebrated as one of the bravest warrior
of that age.  The Scottish youth were emulous of learning, un-
der him, the art of war.  His gallant behaviour at the battle of
Otterburn, warden of the borders; and, from envy, was treach-
erously murdered by Douglas of Liddisdale.-Some years a-
go, an attempt was made to encourage the raising of flax, and,
by the aid of the Trustees, a mill was fitted up for dressing it;
but it was attended with no success.  There is, in the parish,
a bleachfield, which, at present, is managed to considera-
ble advantage.-For some years past, a large and heavy har-
row has been employed with much effect in covering the feed
upon the clay lands.  A fine and deep mould is thereby form-
ed, even in the dryest season.
