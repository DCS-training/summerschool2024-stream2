but in general coals.  They are mostly brought from Dun-
bar, where they cost from 5 s. to 11 s. the boll, which is
11 2/3 cwt. with the addition of carriage.  They this winter
cost sometimes 14 s. the boll, and were often not to be had 
at any rate.  Wages are much the same here as in the
neighbouring parishes, and are stated in their accounts.

   Antiquities.-Part of the church still remains at Auld-
cambus, called St Helen's Kirk.  From the nature of the 
building, and other circumstances, it is supposed to have
been erected some time in the seventh century.  About a
quarter of a mile from the Peas bridge, the remains of an
ancient castle are still standing, called the Old Tower.  It
appears to have been a place of considerable strength, but
nothing certain is known concerning it.  This parish, ly-
ing near the boundary of the kingdoms, and containing
many very strong military passes, has been frequently the
scene of war; and this appears, by the camps of various
kinds still visible on many of the rising grounds, and by
the traces of military entrenchments in the glens.
