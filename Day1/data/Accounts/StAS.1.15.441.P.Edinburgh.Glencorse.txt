   Antiquities-There are some vestiges of camps at Castle-
law, from which the place has probably taken its name.  At
Rullion green, was fought the battle of Pentland-hill, in No-
vember 28th 1665.  A stone is erected in memory of this bat-

and it was from this house that the Regent Murray turned out
the Lady of Hamilton to the inclemency of the season; the
resentment of which was the cause of the Regent's death.  A-
bout a hundred and thirty years ago, the tower of Fulford,
which was likewise a place of great antiquity, was repaired from
the stones of this house, and took the name of Woodhouselee.

manner, and is, at present, a very commodious and comfort-
able dwelling.  The glebe, with the garden, which is a good
one, consists of nearly five acres of ground, together with the
privilege of grazing a cow with one farmer, and ten sheep or
