     of Beith.

   We have 3 principal fairs annually, and a weekly market
upon Friday.  There is often a fine shew of horses in the Beith
markets, especially on the 30th of August, St. Tennant's day,
(supposed to be a corruption for St. Anthony's day,) and on
several Fridays in the beginning of spring.  It is obvious
from the above statement, that the population of the town of
Beith increased with its trade; and that the present decrease
in the number of its inhabitants, is owing chiefly to the de-
cline of the silk manufacture, and to the extensive cotton
works erected in the neighbourhood, particularly in the pa-
rish of Lochwinnoch, and at the town of Johnstone, in the pa-
rish of Paisley.

   Poor.-The funds for supporting the poor are the weekly
collections at the church door; the hire of the mortcloths;
the rent of the poor's aile, the feats of which are let yearly by
roup; the rent of a small farm, purchased with the poor's
money in 1695, and a small proportion of the dues of procla-
marion of marriages.  The average amount of these funds,
from Whitsunday annually, appears, by the register, to be as
follows:

   The collection last year amounted to upwards of 45 L. and
it is still upon the increase, though we have various dissenters,
