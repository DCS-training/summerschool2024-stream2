He also got a leaf to the main door of the nunnery
church, with a lock and key, and built up the other
doors.  His Grace prohibits his tenants from removing
stones from the place where they fall, and charged his
chamberlain to see these orders strictly complied with.
But, notwithstanding the care taken of them, parts of
some of them have fallen, and time has levelled others
of them with the ground.  Some of them have done so
within these few years, and several more within the
memory of some people still living, particularly some
elegant arches near the nunnery, and the abbot's house,
which is said to be a very handsome building.  But
most of the buildings are standing, and seem to have
received no injury but from time, which was probably
the case with the whole of them.  The cathedral, or
St. Mary's, is almost entire, with the steeple.  It is on-
ly within these few years that part of the E. end of the
transverse fell, and some of the head of the cross.  St.
Oran's Chapel is still standing, but in a tottering con-
dition.  The Virgin's Chapel was standing till within
these few years, when part of it fell.  Most of the clois-
ters are still standing.  The Bishop's, which is small, is
also standing.  So that there is still remaining of the
abbey what will give a pretty complete idea of what
it was.
   At the nunnery, there are fewer remains.  The Nun-
nery Church is quite entire; one end of it is arched,
and is very beautiful.  Here also stands, what was call-
ed the parish church.  It is yet entire, but tottering.
There was a court, with a piazza, to the W. side of
the Nunnery Church, and round it the cloisters were
built; but there are hardly any remains of them, but on
the S. side of the court.
