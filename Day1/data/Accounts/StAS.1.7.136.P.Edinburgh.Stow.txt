for grass.  Would the farmers consult their own interest,
and, after limes low their lands with grass the second or third
crop, the hay and pasture would more than compensate
them, besides leaving the land in good heart for after crops;
but men seldom forego a present profit for future gain.

   Sheep.-Nature seems chiefly to have designed this part of
the country for sheep pasture.  The sheep in the higher
parts of the parish seem originally to have been of the black-
faced kind, short legged; and, from the nature of the soil,
which is dry and light, they are hardy, and known by the gra-
ziers to be healthy and good feeders.  The wool is coarse, and
was formerly sold to the Galashiels clothiers for the purpose of
making gray cloth of that name, at from 2 s. 6 d. to 4 s. per
stone.  The sheep in the lower grounds are a cross breed
between the black and the white faced, by which means, to-
gether with a finer pasture in the low lands, the quality of
wool is finer, and the price from 7 s. to 10 s. per stone; and,
from the late advance in that article, 11 s. and 12 s.  This,
perhaps, may also be owing, in a great measure, to the quan-
tity of artificial grass sown.  It is a certain fact, that where
most of this is, the sheep are not only improved in quantity
and quality of wool, but in the value of carcase.-One thing
further is greatly in favour of any improvement by sown
grass.  The farmer will not be obliged, as often formerly, to
drive his sheep to lower ground, at a distance from home,
for food, in a hard winter, having plenty of sown-grass hay,
to supply the sheep when they can get no food from the
ground.  The increase of turnips will also be of great advan-
tage in this respect.

   Number of Sheep.-Though storemasters do not, in gene-
ral, wish to say how many they hold, according to the best
