names; and Seceders often do not enroll at all in the parish
register.

   No foreign trade is carried on, nor is any considerable ma-
nufacture established in the parish; the inhabitants (except-
ing colliers) are mostly employed in agriculture, or in the oc-

140 farm servants are employed by them.  Nine are smiths
