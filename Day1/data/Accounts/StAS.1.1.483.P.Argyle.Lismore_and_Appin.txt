derable arms of the sea, and comprehends the countries of
Lismore, Airds, Straith of Appin, Durror, Glencreren, Glen-
co, and Kingerloch:  The last is 9 computed miles long, si-
tuated in the north side of Linneheloch, an arm of the sea
about 3 leagues over, which divides it from Lismore.  This
united parish is bounded by the seas that divide it from Ard-
chattan and Killmore to the south and fourth-east; by Glen-
urchy or Clachandysart on the east, at the King's House; by
Killmalie on the north-east; by Suineart, a part of the parish
of Ardnamurchan, on the north-west; by Morvein on the 
west; and by the Island of Mull, and the great Western Ocean, 
on the west and south-west.

   Situation and Surface.-This parish is situated in the shire
and synod of Argyle, and presbytery of Lorn.  In a parish
of this prodigious extent, the soil must be various.  The
Island of Lismore, where the minister resides, is 10 miles
long, and from a mile to a mile and a half, or two miles
broad.  It is founded totally on lime-stone rock.  The sur-
face is mostly very rugged and uneven, by the intersection
of the rocks.  The soil is rich, consisting of black soft
loam, formed from the surface of the lime-stone mouldered
down, and produces much grain.  The parish of Appin is a
happy mixture of soil, equally suited to corn and grass; but
by far the greatest part of this extensive parish is mountain-
ous, and well adapted for sheep.  There is very little grain
raised in Kingerloch, or even in the higher parts of Appin,
since sheep stocks have been found beneficial.  Many of
the sheep farms are very extensive*, and, cosidering the
height of the hills, produce excellent grass, and, of course,
very good sheep, perhaps among the best in these western
