was very inconsiderable.  From the year 1760 or 1765, may
be dated the beginning of general improvement in agriculture
in this parish; and, since that period, the rent of land has
risen gradually and rapidly to double and treble its former
amount.  In the year 1780, it had risen to about 2300 L.  At
present (1792) it amounts to 3300 L.

   State of Population.-Of the state of population in this parish
during the last century, scarcely any traces now remain; and
even for a great part of the present century, the only source
of information which exists, is a register of baptisms, the ac-
curacy Of which cannot absolutely be depended on.  For the
last 40 years, this register, it is believed, has been much more
accurately kept*, and during the same period, a very exact
private register of deaths has been fortunately preserved.
Chiefly from there is collected the following table of births,
deaths, and marriages in the parish, from 1st January 1751
to 31st December 1790, both inclusive, divided into 4 pe-
riods of 10 years each.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It may not be improper here to remark the pernicious tenden-
cy of the tax imposed, in the year 1783, on the registers of births
and burials-a tax equally injudicious and unproductive.  As
the only penalty annexed to the non-payment of the tax is the
omission of the article in the register, the legislature has virtually
conferred a premium on every act of negligence or obstinacy.
While it remains unrepealed, it must infallibly introduce confu-
sion and inaccuracy into one of the most authentic records of the
progressive population of the kingdom  From a calculation of
the annual number of births and of deaths in Scotland, it ap-
pears that the gross produce of the tax, exacted with the utmost
rigour, would not amount to 1500 L. Sterling.  It may be ques-
tioned of the money actually received by government exceeds
one half of that sum.
