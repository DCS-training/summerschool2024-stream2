   The salary of the parochial teacher is L.30, with the allowance
from the Dick Bequest, common to the counties of Aberdeen,
Banff, and Moray; that of the endowed school is L.20, with a
house, and six acres of land; that of the Society school is L.17,
with a house, and three acres of land.  In the two latter the
children are taught gratis; in the former, the fees, owing to the
poverty of the parents, seldom exceed a few pounds.
   Education is more valued by all classes than formerly, and in
nothing is this more clearly seen than in the additional number of
girls which is now to be found in all the schools.  None in the
parish are wholly uneducated, or are entirely incapable of read-
ing, although the education of a good many has certainly been
very defective.
   Library.-A parochial religious library was established in 1829,
and has met with tolerable success.  The books are given out:
gratis.
   Savings Bank.-A savings bank was established in 1837, and
promises to do well.
   Poor.-The average number of individuals receiving parochial
aid is about 50, and the amount received by them is from 7s. to
9s. per quarter.  The funds by which they are supported amount
to about L.1300, and the Sabbath collections to L.28 per annum.
The sum distributed by the kirk-session is from L.80 to L.90
annually.
   Fairs.-There are three fairs of some local importance, all held
at Bridge of Potarch-one in May, one in October, and one in
November.
   Inns.-The number of alehouses is four; besides which, there
is one licensed shop where whisky is sold.  Of all these not
more than the half is required for public accommodation, and the
remaining half is merely a tax upon the industry of the neigh-
bourbood.
   Fuel-The chief fuel in use is peat and turf from the bills, to-
gether with dry wood from the plantations.  The expense of peat
is about 1s. per cart-load for cutting, and 1s. 6d. for driving home.
