   Column 7th.  The real rent of the parishes that have sent returns being
in the proportion of L. 52, 10 s.  Sterling to each L. 100 Scoth of va-
lued rent; the real rent of the other parishes is therefore computed in the
same proportion, and marked with an asterisk.  The rent of the parishes
of Old Machar and Newhills, districts particularly circumstanced, is re-
turned at L. 13,500 Sterling.  Proceeding on these principles, it appears,
that the total land rent of the county, including that of the salmon-fishings

   This rent, considerable as it is, compared with the old valuation, it is ho-
ped will fall far short of the sum which this extensive and industrious coun-
ty will reach in a short period: and it is to be observed, that is some pa-
rishes, the grain or victual-rent, has been stated at the rate of only 10s. the
boll, a sum below the actual conversion.
   Column 8th.  The total income of the Clergy in this county, converting
the bear and barley, at 153.; the oats and oatmeal, at 12 5.; and the malt,
at 17 s 6 d. the boll; and computing moderately the stipends of three pa-
rishes that made no returns, amounts to L. 9173:8. 5; which divided by
18, the number of Ministers, gives an average of L. 104, 5 s. to each Cler-
gyman.  In this is included the value of the glebes, amounting, on an ave-
rage, to L 6, 10s. each; and the allowance for communion-elements,
which varies from L. 1:6:8 to L. 10, and averages L.4, 125.
   The ecclesiastical benesice of the parish of Newhills, in this county, is
of a singular description: George Davidson of Pettans, a burgess of Aber-
deen, having, in 1663, mortified the lands of Capelhills, for the maintenance
of the Minister of that parish.  These land, consisting of 563 acres, of
arable, pasture, and moor ground, having a privilege of moss and pasturage,
worth altogether at present L. 140 per annum, possessed by the Minister
of Newhills for the time being, and constitutes the whole of his living, ex-
cept an allowance of about L. 7 for communion-elements.
   Column 9th.  The proportion of scholars to the whole inhabitants of the
parishes that have made returns, being nearly as 1 to 30, the number is
computed after that proportion in the other parishes; and the total number
