ly cattle whole numbers can be ascertained with the greatest
precision.  The tenants (of whom there are 120) keep, at an
average, 4 horses each.  Some of the cottagers have from 1
to 3 horses.  Hence they may be estimated at 600.  They
are small, but hardy, and are reared by the western High-
landers, and sold at our markets, The price, till lately, was
from 3 L. to 4 L.  Within the last two years, the south coun-
try drovers have railed the price from 15 s. to 20 s. a head.
The average value may be computed at 3 L.  It will not be
far wide of the truth to estimate the number of black cattle
at 10 head each tenant, including his oxen; and each mailer
at 1, which will amount to 1448, worth 40 s. each at an
average.  Both horses and black cattle are sent to graze in
the western hills, from May to Michaelmas, at about 1 s. 6 d.
per head.  Of late, since sheep-farming is become prevalent
in the Highlands, the price of grazing low country cattle is
raised to 2 s.  Horses are returned in July to bring home
fuel. if the weather admit of that service being soon per-
formed, they are lent back, The residing heritors keep
about 40 draught horses, worth 15 L. each, and 250 black
cattle, worth 5 L. at an average, besides riding horses and
wheel carriages.

of that name at the S. W. point of the parish, and cannot be
laid to belong to it.  The Connon intersects the parish near
the north end, and is composed of four great branches*.

*There is a spring on the bank of the Connon, near the west
end of the parish, strongly impregnated with sulphur.  The
water is as clear as any other spring, but smells like the scour-
ings of a foul gun.  It is said to partake of the nature of Har-
rowgate water, and to be useful in scorbutic complaints and
rheumatism.  It is of the same kind with the much frequented
spring of Strathpeffer, in the neighbourhood.
