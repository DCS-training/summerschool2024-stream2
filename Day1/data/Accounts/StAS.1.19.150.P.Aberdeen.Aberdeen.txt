     Statistical Account

   There is a steel mineral water on west side of the
town, near the Infirmary, commonly called the Well of Spa,
not so strong as the Peterhead water, which has been thought
of service in those cases wherein recourse is had to chaly-
beate springs.  An essay on the virtues of this water was
published by Dr Barclay, about the beginning of the last
century.  A mineral spring in the grounds of Mr Moir of
Scotstown, in the parish of Old Machar, was, some years
ago, much frequented by the lower classes of people, partly
for health and partly for amusement; but it was filled up
by the proprietor, in the course of improving his lands.
One has, by the tenant, been opened up in the neighbour-
hood, and several people drink the water, although it is not
thought to be so good as the former.  There is another mi-
neral well near Gordon's mills.  Both are weak chalybeats,
and may be of some service in all cases, in which a weak
solution of iron with fixed air can do good.
   There are no lakes in the parish.  That commonly call-
ed the Loch, lying west of the Gallowgate, is no other than
a mill-dam, where the water of a brook is collected and
confined for the use of a malt and flour mill in the town.
One or two small lochs, on the west side of the city of Old
Aberdeen, have been completely drained, and now produce
excellent crops of grain.  A rivulet, called the Denburn,
divides, for a short way, this parish from Old Machar, on
the south-west, and falls into the river Dee, a little above
the quay,
   The river Don is navigable to the bridge, but has no
harbour.  It is navigated by one small sloop, which is em-
ployed in bringing coals to the brick-kilns that are near
the water-mouth.  In a little time there will certainly be
more.  Boats of a very large size might easily, at full tide,
be brought nearly as far as Seaton house.  This circum-
stance would he of great importance were there any ma-
