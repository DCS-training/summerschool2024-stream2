   Agriculture and Rural Economy.--The extent of arable land,
either regularly or occasionally in tillage, is calculated to be 6000
Scots acres; and about 2500 Scots acres remain constantly waste,
or in pasture. Of these, 800 acres may be capable of cultiva-
tion; but it is very questionable whether the application of capital
to their improvement would be profitable. None of the parish is
in a state of undivided common. There are 600 Scots acres un-
der wood, of which not more than to the extent of 3 or 4 acres is
natural. Fir, beecb, and in recent plantations, oak, are the most
common of our cultivated trees. Till of late, little attention was
paid to forest management, the trees being allowed to grow up as
they might, without pruning or thinning. The proprietors are
now more sensible of the importance of this branch of rural eco-
nomy, and begin to plant more extensively, and to bestow more
care on the young plantations.
   Rent of Land.--The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 14s. 6d.
per Scots acre ; but this includes a deal of inferior land in the
higher parts of the parish. In the lower parts, from L. 2 to L. 2,
10s. is a common rent, and some is as high as L. 3 per Scots
acre. On pasture farms, the average rate of grazing is reckoned
to be L. 3 per ox or cow; and 8s. per ewe or full-grown sheep.
On low pastures, where milch cows are taken in to graze, it is
usual to receive L.5 per cow for the season.

<FOOTNOTE>The total number of farms in the parish is 70 ; but of these, several,are occupied
by females; some by the proprietors; some of small size are laboured by.the farmers
themselves; and some are occupied by persons engaged in other employments: none
ofwhich descriptions seem to be included in the above enumeration.
   Of these, 97 are employed in coal-mines.
