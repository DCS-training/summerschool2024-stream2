est and most frequent storms.  While speaking of sirs, it may
be proper to observe, that resinous plants have two seasons
of growth; the first in the spring, and the second after the
early harvest rains.  Early planting is consequently advanta-
geous.  All trees planted here before new year's day thrive
best excepting such as are intended for wet ground, which
ought to be planted in the month of March.  The oak, ash,
beech, alder, sirs*, etc. thrive here, and are equal to any in
their quality.  Lord Galloway has found that pruning makes
them grow with great vigour.  By experiment it appears, that
plants which were pruned, advanced, at the rate of four years
in six, before those which were not pruned.  This treatment
best suits trees which have been taken from the nursery, and
should be attended to in the winter of the second or third
year after they have been planted out.  In the plantations of
a circumference of sixteen miles, trees of every kind grow
with the greatest luxuriance; and some of them have risen,
in a few years, to the height of fifty feet.  His Lordship's de-
signs are great; and he is accomplishing them, by planting,
at the rate of 200,000 trees every year.

   Lakes, etc.-There is a very fine fresh water lake on the
north-west border of the parish, above three miles in circum-
ference, well stored with perch, pike, and eels.  It is called
Dowalton Lake, because a great family of the name of
M'Dowal were proprietors of it, and their place of residence
or town was near it.  The lake surrounds the ramains of a 
house and garden.  The house, it is supposed, was fortified,
and afforded a safe retreat to its Lords, when feudal and al-
lodial rights produced discord and war.  The fish in it are
never caught for sale.  From this lake a rivulet flows, through
a rich valley, to Garliestown Bay.

*The larix, or larch, is found here to be of quick growth.
Its timber is excellent, lasts long under water, and resists the 
worm.
