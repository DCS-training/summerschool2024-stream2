    160                         PEEBLES-SHIRE.

    be observed, that the parish is not surpassed by any in the county,
    either in regard to the mode of management adopted, or in the
    spirit with which it is conducted. All the modern improvements
    are here to be found; and fewer of the old modes which the new
    school of husbandry has exploded are retained than in most
    parishes of the district. Threshing-machines have long been in
    very general use in every farm of any extent, and the in-field and
    out-field system has long been given up.
	Milk-cows are the cattle mostly kept, and their produce finds
    a ready market in Edinburgh. There are also kept on several of
    the farms Highland cattle bought at Falkirk and Hallow Fair, which
    are kept in winter, and either sold off in the spring, or put to pas-
    ture, to be fed for the butcher on the farill. The milk-cows are
    nearer the Ayrshire breed than any other. The Teeswater are also
    kept, and crosses of these kinds are the general stock of the parish.
	Live-Stock.-The number both of horses and cattle is consi-
    derably increased, from a circumstance already stated. The num-
    ber stated in the last Report, was 460 cattle, and 130 horses. There
    are now 772 cattle,-which explains the smaller number of sheep
    kept at present than in 1790. The present number of horses is
    176.
	Rate of Wages.-Of late, wages have rather declined from their
    former rates. This season wages have been from L. 10 to L. 13
    for men, with victuals. Women-servants were hired at Linton
    spring market on March 29, 1833, from L. 3 to L. 4, and upwards,
    for the summer half-year. Last summer labourers received, with-
    out victuals, from 9s. to 10s. weekly. Cotton-weavers at one pe-
    riod gained as high as 14s. per week. At present they hardly
    earn above 5s. during that period.
	Produce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce
    yearly raised in the parish, is

    4000 quarters of oats, which at present prices may be estimated at in pound, Ster-
      ling,                                                             L. 3,200  0  0
    200 acres in turnip, which, being employed in rearing as well as fat-
      tening sheep and cattle, is given to milk cows, the value cannot be
      estimated.
