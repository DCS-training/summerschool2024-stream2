   Lakes, Rivers, Fish, Mills, etc.-The variegated surface,
and the rising hills, make this parish, for we shall now consider
them both as one parish, under the name of Twyneholm, a-
bound in rivulets and springs.  There are two lochs or lakes,
the one upon the extremity of this parish, and dividing it
from Girthon, called Loch-Whinnion, abounding in yellow
trouts; the other called the Loch of Trostrie, abounding in
pikes.  The river Dee, (which is navigable the whole way it
runs along this parish, and upon which there is a ferry boat
between it and Kirkcudbright) abounds with salmon, grilse,
trouts, sea-trouts, and hirlings; and at the southern extre-
mity of the parish, there are some small cod and whitings
taken by lines.  The water of Tarf, (navigable for vessels of
50 tuns burthen up to its lower bridge, upon which, in this
parish, there are a flour, a barley, and a corn* mill, ) has
some salmon, abounds in yellow and sea trouts, hirlings, and
pars, a small red spotted trout never found but where there
are salmon.  The burn of Twyneholm, which divides this pa-
rish in the middle, and which drives a corn and a barley mill,
abounds in all the species of fish found in the water of Tarf,
except salmon.  Another stream of water, which runs along

belonging to them were brought home from neighbouring parishes, in the
worst kind.  But no fever, for the above period, has either spread or become
epidemical.
