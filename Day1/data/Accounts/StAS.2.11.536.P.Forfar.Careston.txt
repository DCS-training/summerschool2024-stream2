from L.2, 10s. to L.3 per imperial acre; although some of the
best pasture land may be rated at L.3 per acre, statute measure.
  Live-Stock.-Hardly any sheep are kept in the parish. A good
set of horses is maintained for agriculture. They are partly reared
in the parish, and partly brought from the west; and the Angus
breed of cattle prevails.

	About 3000 imperial lbs. of butter may be made in the parish,
which at 10d. per lb. will yield L.125. About 350 stones of
cheese may be sold at a low price, or from 4s. to 6s. per stone,
(say 5s., average) L.87, 10s. There may likewise be sold about
200 dozen of eggs, which, on an average of 9d. per dozen, will give
L.7, 10s.
  Improvements, &c.-A considerable part of the haugh land was
recovered about twenty years ago. The general duration of leases
is about nineteen years. But some inclosures of grass-land have
been lately let for cropping for a course of five years, and, at the
end of this short lease must be sown out. The farm-buildings are,
in general, in an ordinary state of repair, and the inclosures are
some good, others indifferent. Part of the land is inclosed with
stone dikes, part with thorn hedges, and another portion conti-
nues still open.
  Fishings.-Some salmon ar fished by the rod in the Esk,
and trout taken in the same manner in the Noran; but there is no
regular fishing for salmon with the net.

  Market-Towns, &c.-Our nearest market-town is Brechin, dis-
tant four miles.
	One daily coach for the use of passengers between Brechin, and
Forfar, passes here daily. There is likewise a statute-labour rnad
between Brechin and Kirriemuir that passes through the upper
part of this parish, kept in tolerable order. There is a bridge con-
sisting of on flat low arch over the Noran.
