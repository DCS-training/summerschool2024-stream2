the wall, are still to be seen.  This castle, from which the
parish derives its name, is situated on the upper part of the
glebe, and in former times must have been impregnable on
the E. and N. On the E. it is defended by a very deep
ravine; on the N. by the Liddal, and a precipice of more
than 100 feet in height; and on the W. and S. by two
ramparts of great strength, and a fosse of great depth.  The
only peel house that remains entire is Hudshouse; the
vault is immensely strong, and has had double doors, bolted
on the inside*.

   Camps.-The principal camp is on the top of Carby Hill.
This hill is detached from all others, and commands a view
of the whole country, and of all that part of Cumberland, by
Beese-Castle, etc.  The camp is entirely circular, and occu-
pies the whole summit of the hill; it is fortified by a very
strong wall of stones, and a road plainly appears to have
been made up to it, winding round a part of the hill, and
entering it on the south.  It is about 100 feet diameter.
In the centre a small space is inclosed with a strong wall,
and round it are 8 circles of different sizes+, all surrounded
by a stone wall, and all of them having had a door or open-
ing to the east.  On the summit of the Side-hill, and nearly
opposite to Carby, on the north side of the Liddal, there is
another strong encampment, nearly of a square form.  It
is 300 feet in diameter.  The wall or rampart is entirely
of earth, and is about 18 feet high.  This camp has none

<FOOTNOTE>

*There were many square towers formerly in this country, the place
of residence of the principal families, and all of them places of strength.
They were chiefly on the banks of the river Liddal, viz. Peel, Huds-
house, Prickinghaugh, Whithaugh, Hillhouse, Riccarton, Mangerton,
Puddingburn, etc.  Of these nothing remain but the foundations.
