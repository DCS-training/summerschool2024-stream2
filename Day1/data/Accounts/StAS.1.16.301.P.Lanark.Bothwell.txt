the Shotts.  The ground to the south of the road gradual-
ly declines toward the river, which gives a fine prospect of
the Clyde, Hamilton, and the adjacent country.
   The great flat of the upper part of the parish is, at a
medium, 300 feet above the level of the sea; that toward
the Clyde is greatly lower.
   The church and village of Bothwell is 36 1/2 miles from
Edinburgh, per section from the great road leading to the
village; 8 from Glasgow; 27 from Stirling; 17 from La-
nark.
   The distance from neighbouring parishes, (bearing and
distance from the church), are these: Hamilton, south-
east, separated by the Clyde, 3 miles distance.  Blantyre,
upon the south, separated also by the Clyde; distance, 3
miles.  North-west is Old Monkland, separated by North
Calder; distance, 3 miles.  Upon the north, New or East
Monkland, distance 8 miles, separated by the North Calder.
Upon the north-east, the Shotts, distance 8 miles.  Cam-
busnethan E. N. E. separated by South Calder, distance 8
miles.  Upon the east, Dalziel, at 3 miles distance, sepa-
rated by the South Calder.

   Surface and Soil.-The parish rises gradually from the
Clyde to the north, and still more to the north-east.  Upon
the banks of the river, south from the church, a large flat
succeeds; at the termination of which, an ascent takes place
toward the middle, or the line of the turnpike, where it
rests in another large level, extending almost the whole
length of the parish, but rising in some places toward the
north, and very considerably to the east.
   There can scarcely be said to be either moss, moor or
morals in the parish.  If there are some spots of the two
last, they are so small as not to deserve consideration.  In
general, all is arable.
