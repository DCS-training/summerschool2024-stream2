first obtained for him the celebrity which he afterwards enjoyed.
       	Dr Thomas Reid.--This distinguished metaphysician and moral
philosopher was settled minister of this parish May 12, 1737, and
continued in that office till June 21, 1752.
      	With respect to the two eminent individuals above-mentioned,
it is not thought necessary here to detail the various particulars
of their life, attainments, or writings; all that is known with cer-
tainty of them being already before the public.

its way to be deserving of notice. The first 160 pages of the
register are occupied with sessional matters during the incum-
