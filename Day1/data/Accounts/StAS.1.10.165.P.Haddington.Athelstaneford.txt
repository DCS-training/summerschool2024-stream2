farmer has it now in his power to keep his land much clean-
er than he formerly could do.  The feeding of cattle on tur-
nips gives him an additional quantity of manure; and, what
is perhaps of greater value, the potching of the land, in car-
rying off the turnips for feeding cattle, or in eating them
with sheep upon the ground, has been found to be a more
effectual method of extirpating the annual weeds with which
the lands were formerly much infested, than any other with
which they were formerly acquainted.  Besides turnips, a con-
siderable quantity of potatoes are raised, which are a great
blessing to the lower class of people.  Of late, there was a
coarse kind of potatoe introduced here, called the yam, not,
as is supposed the real American yam, but the Surinam po-
tatoe, considerably larger than the common one, some of
them weighing above 2 pounds.  They are more prolific
than the common potatoe, an acre of land properly prepared
generally producing from 80 to 100 bolls.  The stem grows
very luxuriantly, and therefore they should never be planted
closer than 3 feet between the rows, and 18 inches in the
row.  Cattle are uncommonly fond of them, and they are
found to feed well.  They are particularly proper to be given
to milch cows, increasing the quantity of milk, without any
injury to the taste, and improving the butter both in colour
and flavour.
   There are 16 farms in the parish one of which is in
the natural possession of one of the proprietors, and three
are possessed by farmers who do not reside on them.  There
is one farm of about 500 acres, another of 350, and a third
of about 300.  The rest are from 150 to 200 acres each,
with the exception of one that is only about 50.  A consider
able part of the parish is inclosed, but there still remains a
good deal to be done in that way.  From their vicinity to
Haddington, the farmers can dispose of the various produce
