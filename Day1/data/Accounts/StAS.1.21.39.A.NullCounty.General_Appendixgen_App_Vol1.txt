never under 2 1/2 d.; sometimes much mores especially the first

   Tides, Landmarks, etc.-Sea-weed of the common kind is
thrown in by the winter storms, in great quantities, and much
used for manuring lands.  The sides are very equal; and no
remarkable currents nigh the coast, nor rocks, except those
already mentioned.  As for landmarks, the rock of Aiifa ris-
ing like a losty broad shouldered cone, ten miles from the
nearest coast, serves admirably for the entrance of the Frith
of Clyde; and to the south of it, in case of a storm, there is
a safe retreat in Lochryan; on the north, in Lamlash, an ex-
cellent harbour, in Arran.  The Brown Carrick hill, 3 miles
to the south of us, presents a noble ridge, of nearly the same
length from east to west; towards the last it bears its high-
est point, and from thence slopes gently down to the sea.  But
on its north side, it sends out, beyond a deep narrow valley,
a bold promontory or two, contiguous to one another, called
the Bowerhill, or, Heads of Ayr; and another not so high,
about half a mile farther east, called Greenan, with the re-
mains of an old castle, on the very brink of the precipice.
About 8 miles north from these promontories, is the small
flat rocky island, called Lady Isle, inhabited only by a few
rabbits, but supposed to afford good anchoring ground on its
east side, and therefore has of late years had two pillars erec-
ted on it, for directing ships to find their proper station there.
Nothing, however, but extreme necessity, can induce any ship
to attempt anchoring there, be the ground ever so good, be-
cause there is no shelter above.
   All these landmarks, with the steeple of the town, the
tower of St. John's in the citadel, and a large sugar house
near the shore, furnish good direction towards the harbour
of Ayr.
