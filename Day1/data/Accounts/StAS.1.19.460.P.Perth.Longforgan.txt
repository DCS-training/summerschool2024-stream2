     Statistical Account

   Name.-The derivation of the name Forgan is unknown,
but it must be very ancient, and appears to have been ori-
ginally called Forgund, from a grant of the lands and baro-
ny of Longforgund to Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth, by
King Robert Bruce, in the year 1315.  The epithet Long,
probably, is applicable to the village only, to distinguish it
from others of the same name.

   Contents.-It contains the estates of Castle Huntly and
Monorgan, Drimmie, Millhill, Knap, Dron, and Littleton,
Mylnefield, Lauriston, Lochton, two Ballos, two Newtons,
and Temple Hall.

   Rent and Heritors.-The valued rent is L.7254:6:8
Scotch.  The real rent would be difficult to ascertain, by 
it may be about L.7000 Sterling per annum, which will 
most probably be considerably increased when the present
leases are expired.  There are eleven heritor, six of whom
reside, the rest do not.

   Climate.-The climate; in the lower part of this parish is
mild, snow seldom lying above a week at a time; but in 
the hilly part it is less so.  There, the snow lies much
longer in winter, and there is at least three weeks differ-
ence between the ripening of the crops above and below
the hills.  All over the parish, however, the weather is
various, and frequently changes very considerably two or
three times in a day.  The winters are neither long nor
sever.  The springs are short.  In the month of May, and
beginning of June, cold easterly wind prevail; but in 
general the west and south-west wind are the most prevalent
through the year.  In June and July, the weather is
warm and fine.  About the beginning of August rains are
frequent; but the autums are fine, and frosts seldom set in 
very sever till after Christmas.
