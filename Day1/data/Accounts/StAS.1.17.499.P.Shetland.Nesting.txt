appeal lies from that presbytery, but to the General Assem-
bly.

   Fisheries.-The inhabitants adventure in what we call the
Great Fisheries of ling, cod, and tusk; but the principal
part of their subsistence arises from the small fishing of pill-
tock and fillock, which, except in very extraordinary years,
they can pursue at no expence, and with great advantage, all
the year round.

Population.-This ministry contains a greater number of
inhabitants, in proportion to the rental land, than any
other in Shetland, owing to the exertions of the two prin-
cipal heritors, Mr Bruce Steuart if Symbister, and Mr Hun-
ter of Lunna, in making outlets, or new settlements, on
grounds formerly uncultivated.  These improvements have
been attempted with the view of increasing the number of
fisherman on their respective estates; but when the fishing
fails, as it often does, teses settlers on new grounds become
burdens on the proprietor; and, without the assistance of
their landmatter, must starve, when the small fishing fails for
their support; for none of them have a possession of land, that,
with the best cultivation, and in the most favourable years,
can supply their families in meal, or any kind of grain, for
nearly one half of the year.

   So long as the present proprietors of Whalsay and Lun-
nesting are able to continue in the management of their own
lands the tenants may continue, and the lands may be culti-
vated; but, should the successors of these gentlemen have a
less active, or a different turn of mind, there is reason to fear
a great decrease of the population.
