were 63 silk looms at work there, but at present there are on-
ly 33, and these are mostly employed in weaving cotton of dif-
ferent fabrics; the materials of which are furnished by the Glas-
gow and Paisley manufacturers.  There are 4 joiners, 2 smiths,
4 shoemakers, 5 taylors, 3 coopers, 8 day-labourers, 2 horse-
dealers, 1 baker, 8 public house-keepers, (but only two of these
have stabling for horses).  These houses have here, as well as in
other places, very bad effects.  Surgeons, at different times,
have attempted to settle at Eaglesham; but made no stay on ac-
count of wanting employment:  And there are places, at no
great distance, from which, when necessary, they are easily
had.-The hire of women-servants for the half year, is from
L. 1:15 to L. 2:5, and of men-servants, from L. 3:10 to
L. 4:10.  The hire of a day-labourer is 1s. in winter, and
15d. in summer.
   There are a few Cameronians, 40 Antiburghers, who at-
tend public worship at a meeting-house in the parish of
Mearns.  Besides the minister of the Established Church,
there is one of the Burgher communion.  About 60 of the
parishioners are his hearers; the rest of his congregation
come from the neighbouring parishes.

   Morals, Poor, etc.-The people in general are very in-
dustrious:  There are few in the parish in as affluent circum-
stances, but they support themselves and families in a com-
fortable manner.  At church, and other public occasions,
they are clean and decent.  No parish has fewer real poor.
The charity-roll is seldom above 7; though there are some fami-
lies that require a little assistance, if the funds could afford it.
But the heritors and inhabitants are averse to any assessment,
and there are no mortifications.  The collections amount to
about L. 16, sterling per annum.-The morals of the
people are, according to the best information, stricter now
