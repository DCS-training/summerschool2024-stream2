it off in grass, partly for hay, and partly for pasturage, which
afforded them plenty of meat for their horses employed in driv-
ing lime, and carrying on their improvements in the next, and
other years, they then applied their whole strength for ma-
nuring their outfield, at the rate of 40 to 50 bolls of lime-
shells* to the English acre, which, after being fallowed, and
so limed, produced three good crops, viz. oats, barley, oats;
or, oats, pease, barley.  They then fallowed and, laying all
their muck upon the fallow well pulverized, they formed it
into drills, and sowed turnips on the drills, which were eaten
by their sheep in the winter, and then ploughed and sowed it
up with grass-feeds, in the same manner as the infield; and
so they went on with the rest of the outfield, and by the end
of 10 or 12 years, their farms were all thus improved; and
were all managed and cropt thereafter as infield, and in the
following manner, viz.  They commonly allowed their sown
up grass ground to remain in grass for at least 3 years, some
4 or 5, and haying and pasturing it alternately; and after sow-
ing it out for corn-crops, they took only three crops from the
richest and best parts of the farms; these were oats, barley,
oats; or, oats, pease, wheat, if the land had any tolerable mix-
ture of good clay in it; and they then followed it, sowed up
the turnip-land with barley, oats, and grass-feeds, as before.
In their middling soil, they took only two crops of corn, oats
and barley, and thereafter fallow, turnip, barley and grass-
feeds; and in the weakest and lightest of their soil, they only
took one crop of oats, and then fallow, turnip, barley, and
grass-feeds; and in this second course they also gave it ano-
ther liming of 25 to 30 bolls lime-shells the acre, and com-
monly with the second crop of the strongest and middling soils;
