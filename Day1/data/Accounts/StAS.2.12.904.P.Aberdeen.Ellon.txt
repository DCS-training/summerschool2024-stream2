Kenmuick, probably, one of the oldest in this part of Scotland, was
Kennedy or Kemptie.
   The last Roman Catholic priest of Ellon was Andrew Leslie,
who retained the benefice at least as late as the year 1563.  The
first Protestantminister was Alexander Ogilvy, who appearsin the re-
gister of ministers and their stipends for that year as minister of Tar-
ves, Methlick, Ellon, and Fyvie.  It is not likely that he was in pos.
session of the benefices of any of these parishes.  His stipend, which
is stated to be six score merks, was probably paid from the thirds.
   The village of Ellon is thus described in Loch's Essay on the
Trade, &c. of Scotland, Edinb. 1778, Vol. ii. p. 121, " a small
kirk-town, the property of Lord Aberdeen, containing in the whole
parish about 3000 people.  Much is done here in the knitting of
stockings; no less than L.100 per week being paid by the Aber-
deen merchants for this article alone.  A good deal is also spun,
and four looms are employed for the country use.  Upon the wholes
this place is improving fast, the country is populous, and the peo-
ple very industrious." *
   The estimate given in the above extract of the amount of the
population will appear by and by to have been much exaggerated.
The manufacture of stockings as an article of trade has long since
been discontinued in this part of the country.
   Land-owners.-There are eight proprietors of land in the pa-
rish, each of whom draws an annual income from it of upwards of
L.50. These are, the Right Honourable the Earl of Aberdeen;
the Honourable William Gordon of Ellon; Charles Napier Gor-
don of, Hallhead ; John Turner of Turnerhall Lieutenant-Colo-
nel, Udny of Udny; John Leith Ross of Arnage; William Cham-
ber, Hunter of Tillery.; and John Cruickshank of Peltachie.
The measurements of their respective estates in the parish, ac-
cording to the best, though, in several instances, imperfect, data
