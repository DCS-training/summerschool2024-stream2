     Statistical Account

   The whole of this estate, like most other estates in the He-
brides, is occupied by three different orders of tenants; 1st,
principal tacksmen or gentlemen; 2d, small tenants; 3d,
cotters.
   The common and ancient computation of lands in these
countries is by pennies, of which the subdivisions are halfpen-
nies, farthings, half farthings, clitigs, etc.  Of these a gen-
tleman, according to the extent of his tack, possesses a vast
many, perhaps 20 pennies, perhaps many more.  This rec-
koning comprehends muir, pasture, and arable lands, for
which the tacksman pays so much yearly rent in the lump,
during the currency of his lease.  Of this extensive posses-
sion he may subset a third or a fourth.  Each sub-tenant in
Harris generally holds the division of a farthing, for which
he pays, according to the supposed value of the lands, from
20 s. to 40 s. in money, besides personal services, rated at a
day's labour per week, to the principal tacksman.  The per-
sonal services of so many sub-tenants are reckoned indispen-
sible under the present mode of management, in addition to
the prodigious establishment besides, of cotters and house-
hold servants, both male and female, which a gentleman sup-
ports in order to carry on the common business of the farm
throughout the year.  The single article of fuel coasts a vast
expence of labour.  A gentleman, according to the number
of fires his farm requires him to keep up, cuts of peats from
30 to 50 irons, and the cutting of an iron employs four
men; the drying, stacking, and leading of them home re-
quires an expence of hands in proportion.  Repairing of the
seal dykes and inclosures, a work of perpetual labour, weed-
ing of corn, making of kelp, reaping of the different crops,
hay, barley, oats, and potatoes in harvest, and the laborious
tillage for raising these crops in winter and spring, besides
the thatching and repairing of houses, tending and herding
