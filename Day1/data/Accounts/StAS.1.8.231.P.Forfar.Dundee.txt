the ancient nave; and by a decree of the- Lords of Session,
both were erected into churches on the establishment, for
two additional stipendiary ministers, who officiate as col
leagues in both by turns.  As the town-council had after the
revolution, acquired the patronage of the first change by pur-
chase, they are now considered as undoubted patrons of all
the five.
   The stipends of the two stipendiary ministers, on the old
establishment, are each 140 L.  The first minister's stipend,
including his glebe, and an old allowance for house rent,
exceeds those of his colleagues a few pounds.  No part of
it affects the teinds of the parish, except one chalder of meal,
and another of barley, and 66 L. 13 s. 4 d. in money.  With
respect to all the three, it is to be observed, that 20 L. of each
stipend is an addition made by the council, only three years
ago, upon account of the increased expence of living, and con-
tinues no longer than the lives of each incumbent.  The sa-
laries of the two stipendiary ministers, on the new establish-
ment, are no greater than 120 L each.
   Besides these 5 established ministers, two others, ordained
and in the communion of the church of Scotland, officiate in
two Chapels of Ease.  One of these chapels was built in 1772,
by the joint exertions of the Kirk-Session, and the 9 incorporat-
ed and united trades, chiefly by means of donations and chari-
table contributions, and continues under the management of
these societies.  It is as large almost as any of the other
churches, and its minister receives a salary of 100 L.  The
other was built in 1789. by a separate congregation of the
Relief persuation, now, on their own application, received,
along with their minister, into the church, He receives a
stipend of 90 l. and the chapel may contain 800 or 900 peo-
ple.  A third chapel also, under the direction of the church
of Scotland, belongs to a congregation of Highlanders, who
