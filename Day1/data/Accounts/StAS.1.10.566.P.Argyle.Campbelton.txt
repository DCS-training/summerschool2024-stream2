their land by over-cropping, could the farmers be persuaded

in it.
   But the most general advantage of this parish, and of all
the western Highlands and Isles of Scotland, would arise by
their being for ever exempted from the oppressive duty upon
coals carried coast-ways, as at present two or three months
of the best season of the year are spent by the farmers, and
other inhabitants, in preparing a miserable and precarious
kind of fuel, when they should be carrying on fencing, drain-

improvement.  Till this duty is abolished, Campbelton can
derive but little advantage from its having coal so near it; as
the price will always keep pace with that which we must pay
for coal imported.  And considering its inferior quality, per-
haps it is higher; so that in fact we may be said to pay the
duty, though, strictly speaking, duty free.  The mosses in
many of the isles, and in many parts of the continent, are
now exhausted, and the distress of the inhabitants loudly calls
for the equity and humanity of government, for a mitigation
of their distress*.
   With regard to the town of Campbelton, its particular in-

whose wages can hardly furnish himself with bare subsistence,
instead of having a family to maintain, who at present can
