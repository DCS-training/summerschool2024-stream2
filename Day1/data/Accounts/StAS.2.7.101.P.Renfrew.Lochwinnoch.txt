Esq. improved at great expense his Property of Heathfield, form-
ing part of the high lands in the north-western part of the parish,
now the property of James Watt, Esq. in Greenock, and John
Millar, Esq. Glasgow; and improvements upon a smaller scale
have been carried on throughout the whole parish. Still there are
individuals, especially among the small proprietors, who, from want
of skill, or energy, or money, have not made the most of their
properties.

   Quarries, &c.-There are quarries of various kinds in the parish.
There is a small lime quarry which is wrought at present, and lime
exists in other places where no present use is made of it. There
is abundance of freestone and other kinds of stone for building, and
quarries are opened when they are required. There are two coal
pits, the one at Hallbill on the eastern, and the other at Nervel-
stone, in the western extremity of the parish. The former is worth
about L. 300 a-year after expenses are paid. The latter is less
valuable, and the working of it has lately been discontinued.
   Manufactures.-The first manufacture in which the inhabitants
of this parish were engaged to any considerable extent was that of
linen. About the time of the Union in 1707, this manufactory
was introduced into Paisley, and the famers in this as in other
places began to grow flax, and their female domestics were em-
ployed in making yarn for this manufactory. In the progress of
the trade a company was formed here, who built a small factory
about 1740, and a larger one about 1759 for linen and cam-
brick.
   Mr Humphry Fulton, who was connected with this parish, in-
troduced the manufacture of silk into Paisley after the model of
the Spittalfield weavers in 1759; and before 1780, the elegant
gauze trade was the chief manufacture in Renfrewshire; but it
gave place to the cotton muslins about 1785 or l790.
