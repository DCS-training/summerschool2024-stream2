got.  They are better adapted to this climate than Easdale
slates; and yet, because these last have a preferable appear-

   Limestone.-There is plenty of limestone in there parishes,
but through the scarcity of fuel wherewith to burn it, and
of hands whereby to work it, there is no lime made in the
parish of Stromness, and but an inconsiderable quantity in
the parish of Sandwick, by the principal heritor there.

   Freestone.-Freestone has been lately found in the parish
of Sandwick, but it is hard, and not of good quality.

   Minerals.-There are appearances of lead and iron ore
in the parish of Stromness.  The lead-ore in the clefts of
the rocks has the appearance of melted load.  In 1755,
miners from England wrought the lead-mines, and sent
away a considerable quantity of the ore; but, either the
ore was not rich enough to repay the expences, or the vein
was small and soon exhausted, or the work was unskilfully
carried on, and too expensively managed; for one or other
of these reasons it was abandoned.  A few years afterwards
the attempt was again made to open the lead-mines in an-
other part of this parish, which also failed.

   Mineral Springs.-There are some mineral springs in
these parishes.  There is one in the vicinity of the village
of Stromness, which has been tried for scorbutic complaints,
