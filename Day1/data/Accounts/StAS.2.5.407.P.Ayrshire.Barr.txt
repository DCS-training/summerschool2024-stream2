		              PARISH OF BARR.

		PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

		     THE REV. E. B. WALLACE, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	BARR was erected into a parish in the year 1653, consisting of
the more remote parts of the adjoining parishes of Girvan and
Daily.
	Name.--The etymology of the name is uncertain. If conjec-
ture may be allowed, the small village of Barr, where the manse
and kirk are built, and which has evidently given its name to
the parish, was so called from its inaccessibleness,--being hem-
med in on every side by precipitous hills, and approachable only
by rugged glens, and across a stream which, dwindling into a pur-
ling rill in summer, rushes with a torrent's fury in winter, and, con-
fining itself to no settled course, passes from side to side of the
narrow strath through which it runs, and turns up every vestige of
a roadway along its gravelly banks. The parish did, indeed, con-
stitute a strong natural barrier between Galloway on the south and
Ayrshire to the north, and was nearly inaccessible until within the
last thirty years.
	Extent, &c.--The parish is of a regular oblong figure, and mea-
sures, by a recent survey taken by Government, 12 miles by 9;
but in any possible way of travelling is not less than 15 or 16 by
10 or 11. It contains of course about 100 square miles. Its
boundaries, beginning with the south-east side and proceeding
roundward by the east, are Minnigaff in Galloway, Straiton, Dailly,
Girvan, and Colmonell, which stretches out a long slender arm,
encompassing a great part of it in the west and south and push-
ing itself like a wedge between Barr and Penningham, till it
reaches Minnigaff, already mentioned.
	Topographical Appearances.--The parish is very hilly, with an
extensive flat: two ridges line the water of Stinchar, which rise
and flows in the parish 14 or 15 miles. A third ridge runs pa-
rallel to these on the south-east, and beyond lies the level coutry
