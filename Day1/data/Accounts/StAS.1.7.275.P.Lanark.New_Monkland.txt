the cart, weighing 12 cwt.  Excellent smithy coal, and blind,
coal for drying grain and malt, are found at Airdrie, and sell
at 2 s. 6 d. the cart.  On account of its superior quality, it is
carried 20 miles and upwards round the country.  Lime has
been found in the north part of the parish, but is not wrought
at present.  There are plenty of free-stone quarries, and a-

Parliament for commuting the statute work for money.  Since
that period, the reads are greatly improved, and a bridge
built over almost every rivulet.  The present conversion is

land have such good road.  An act was obtained last session
of Parliament, for making a turnpike road from Edinburgh
to Glasgow, by Bathgate and Airdrie, the tract of which will
run through this parish for many miles, and, when finished,
