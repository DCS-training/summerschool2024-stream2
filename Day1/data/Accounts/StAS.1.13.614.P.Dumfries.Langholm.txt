Eight miles of the road from Langholm to Annan were formed in the
year 1760 by Mr Pulteney, at his own private expense, viz. from Ir-
vine (where it leaves the great road between Edinburgh and Carlisle,
and which was opened in the year 1765) to Springkell; and he was
at the sole expense of that part of the road passing through his estate of
Seiway-bank, which was finished last harvest, in the district of Half-
moreon; all the other roads in that quater being made, and making at
the expense of Sir William maxwell, and the voluntary contributions of
his tenants, as already stated.
