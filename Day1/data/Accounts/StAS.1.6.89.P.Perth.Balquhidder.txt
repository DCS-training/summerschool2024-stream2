torrents from the adjacent hills, and partly four and mossy,
which is very level, a great part of it being covered by three
lakes.

   Lakes, Inurdaneous, and Fish.-The lakes are Lochdoine,
Lochvoil, and one half of Lochlubnaig.  In time of floods,
the intermediate grounds, both meadow and arable, are al-
most wholly inundated, so as to form one continued sheet
of water about 12 miles in length.  There are, perhaps,
10 or 12 such floods in a year.  When any of them happen
in the months of August or September, which is often the
cafe, they occasion very considerable damage.  These lakes
are connected by the river Balvag, and are one of the sources
of the Teith, which passes through Callendar of Monteith, and
runs into the Forth near Stirling.  These lakes and river abound in
common0-trout, bull-trout, and jar, all of an excellent quality;
a few salmon appear in the proper season, and great numbers
in spawning-time.  THe trout is in greatest perfection in A-
pril and May; the jar in August.  There is a considerable fall
at a small distance from the foot of Lochlubnaig, where, by
cutting some feet of rock, carryinf forward the level, deep-
ning a few fords, and straighting the course of the river, it is
likely a considerable quantity of ground might be gained from
the lakes, the overflowing be greatly prevented, or at any rate
more speedily carried off.  Mr Buchanan of Achleshie, a con-
siderable heritor in this parish, and an enterprising and suc-
cessful improver, has this season began to cut the rock near
the foot of Lochlubnaig: if all the other heritors concerned
will heartily co-operate, it is to be hoped the good effects will
soon be visible on these often deluged lands. The plan pro-
posed seems rational and equitable, viz. that the different pro-
prietors upon the sides of these lakes and river, should bear the
expence in proportion to the benefit which shall eventually ac-
