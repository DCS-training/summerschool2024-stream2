took place.  The first had one effect, particularly in the
low country, which will be questioned as an improvement.
By obliging the farmer to winter-herding, he was discou-

of which, where large stocks were formerly kept, not one
is now to be found.
   The spirit of commerce happily saved the manufactures
from the consequential want of the raw material, which
that system of farming threatened.
   The woollen manufacture is now carried on more imme-
diately by the merchant, who imports from London and
Newcastle the raw wool, which he causes to be combed,
and given out to the spinsters and knitters throughout the
country, from stations in every parish which they regularly
attend, either weekly or monthly, as suits best with the
circumstances of the place, or convenience of the manufac-
turer.
   By this revolution in the woollen manufacture, a greater
variety and better quality of goods are made, particularly
of stockings, which is now the principal article of the
woollen export.
   The plaidens and fingroms, which were formerly the
great staple articles, are now almost quite out, and no more
is exported than is sufficient for under-wrappers to the bales
of stockings.
   Several manufactures of coarse cloths are set on foot, but
as the quantity made does not much exceed the demand for
home consumption, a small quantity only is exported.
   The stocking-manufacture is considerably increased.  It
is thought rather to exceed L. 100,000 Sterling annually, of
which about two-thirds are sent to Holland and Germany,
and one-third to England, Portugal, and America.
   One-fourth of the whole value may be reckoned to the
