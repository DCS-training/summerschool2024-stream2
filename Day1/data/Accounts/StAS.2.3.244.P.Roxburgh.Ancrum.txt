been well adapted for the purpuse, having not only been extreme-
ly difficult of discovery and access, but having been provided with
fire-places and apertures in the roof to carry off the smoke, and
commanding a plentiful supply of water. But the days are happily
gone bye, when, from the predatory habits of the borderers, such
hiding-places were rendered necessary; and, as a pleasing contrast
to their original destination, it may be mentioned, that they were
often resorted to for retirement and meditation, by the author of
the "Seasons;" and one in particular, named "Thomson's Cave,"
is pointed out as his favourite retreat, and which is situated in the
immediate vicinity of the manse, of which the poet was the frequent
inmate during the incumbency of his friend Mr Cranston.--Mai-
den Lilliard's tomb may also be considered as an interesting
relic of the olden time. At the battle of Ancrum Moor, above-
mentioned, a Scottish woman of this time name distinquished her-
self by her singular valour; such being her undaunted gallantry,
that she continued to fight when covered with wounds, and even
after both her limbs had been struck off. In honour of her me-
mory, the spot where she fought and fell, and on which she was
buried, is marked by a momument, the original of which has almost
all been destroyed, but in whose stead a new one was lately erect-
ed, on which is inscribed the original epitaph, which runs thus:

         Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this stane,
         Little was her stature but great was her fame;
         Upon the English loons she laid mony thumps,
         And when her legs were cuttit off she fought upon her stumps.

There are likewise on the hill behind. Ancrum House the re-
mains of a British fort, consisting of three circular divisions or
rows of large whinstone boulders; and at Harestanes, near Moun-
teviot, there stood within these fifty years the remains of a Druid
circle, but which now, with the exception of one solitary stone,
have all been removed. And in the centre of the village green,
there stands an ancient cross, which one of the most learned archi-
tectural antiquaries of the present day thinks may be pronounced
as old as the reign of Alexander III.
        Mansion-Houses.--There are three principal residences in the
parish: Ancrum House, the seat of Sir William Scott, Bart a
fine old baronial-looking mansion, standing in the midst of an exten-
sive park, in which are to be seen some of the finest trees in the
south of Scotland, and whose picturesque effect is much increas-

   The following is the measurement of some of these trees, the measurement being
taken several feet from the root:
