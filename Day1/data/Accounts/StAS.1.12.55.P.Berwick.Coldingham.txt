     Of Coldingham.

and labourers seem to depend upon the farmers for their sub-
sistence, as they are principally employed by them.  There
are, however, about 36 master weavers in the parish, who,
besides what they weave for the inhabitants, manufacture a
good deal of linen and woollen cloths for sale.  They are ge-
nerally in easy circumstances, and some of them are becoming
rich in that line of life.

   Professions, Manners, etc.-There are several shopkeepers
in the town of Coldingham, but none of them deal exten-
sively.  No writers or attorneys of influence; nor is there
one single justice of peace resident in this large parish.  No
Papists, Episcopals, or Unitarians.  The established Presby-
terian religion is the only manner of worship attended to and
professed here; there are, however, a few seceders, who at-
tend the Burgher and Antiburgher meetings at Ayton.  They
tax themselves with a proportion of the expense of building
the meeting-houses, and the preacher's stipend.  Thus they
sacrifice their money, as toll-dues, for the safest or surest pas-
sage to the regions of complete happiness in a future state.
The generality of the people in this parish are sober, frugal
and industrious, plain and decent in their dress and deport-
ment, and very few of them discover any desire for fineries
or expensive amusements.  The only extravagance they are
guilty of is their breakfasting upon tea, in place of pottage,
the constant morning diet of their more athletic ancestors,
which debilitates them; (here I do not include the princi-
pal families) and the immoderate use of whisky, which too
many of the lower class are guilty of, which destroys them.
This is owing to the cheapness of these two superfluous and
pernicious articles, which appear to be objects more fit for
taxation than coals, candles, leather and soap, which are as
necessary in the poorest families, as their meal and milk.
