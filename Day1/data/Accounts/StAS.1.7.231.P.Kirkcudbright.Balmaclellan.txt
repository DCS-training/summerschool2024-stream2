   School.-In addition to the legal school salary of this parish,
amounting to about 11 L Sterling or thereby, there was 2
few years ago a donation made of 500 L by a native of this
place, a Mr Murdoch late merchant in Glasgow.  This fund
is secured on land, which, at present, is said to yield more
than 5 per cent.; so that the school salary of this parish now
amounts to nearly 36 L  This, however, is the whole income

   Disadvantages.-The peculiar disadvantages of this parish
are chiefly of two kinds, neither of which, unfortunately for

Nearly one fourth of the parish, as before described, being,
from its soil, incapable of culture, is a manifest disadvantage
attached to property in this situation, and which no efforts
of genius or of industry can surmount.  Even here, however,
there is not wanting scope for considerable meliorations.  A
superior mode of fencing and subdividing farms, are improve-
