tainly be generous in those who may have the means of being acquainted
with it, to disclose it, that the intentions of the Noble Donor might be
answered, and the circumstances of the teacher bettered.  For at present
he derives no other advatage from that endowment than the house he
lives in ; and his place, including every thing belonging to it, does not
amount to L. 19 a-year.  Why then should we complain of the want of
learning in our teachers, or be surprised if their successors are not half so
learned. In most country parishes the number of scholars is very preca-
rious, and the school wages exceedingly small, as small in many of them
as they were 20 years ago ; in which case, what is to be expected, but
that either the teacher is himself untaught, or that he is dispirited in
teaching, and in a perpetual struggle for a better place.  By which
means he neglects his present trust, and offends his present employers.
It would be wrong indeed to make them independent of their office, but
it would be as far wrong to starve them in it.  Let them have what is
proper to call forth their exertions, and to reward their abilities, and then
we shall see the prosession as respectable as it is useful.
