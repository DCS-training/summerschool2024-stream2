flitches; headachs; swellings and boils, now and then, on
various parts of the body; lassitudes and melancholy habits,
&c.  All these, and many more that will not bear description,
are the dismal effects of this dreadful scourge, and are all
severely felt from time to time among the people at large,
and premature death is often the consequence; several instances
of which could be given in this, and in other neighbouring
districts, within these 10 years past.  It is dreadful to think
in how many ways this shocking distemper preys on the hu-
man frame, and often renders the unhappy sufferer a nuisance
to himself and to society.  Besides, the nature of this, as well
as of all other putrid distempers, is extremely infectious:
The clothes scorbutic persons wear and sleep in, and the air
they breath, will convey insensibly the contagion to a clean
person; and they who sheep with them must soon feel the
woeful consequences*.  It is a pity that no specific has yet been
found sufficient, to eradicate this growing evil, or at least to
counteract its malignant force.  Nothing, perhaps, would be
more worthy the attention of government, than to offer pre-
miums for the most effectual specifics against so destructive a
distemper; the consequence might be, the hardy soldier, and
the healthy subject.

*Of the truth of the above remarks, there is a melancholy instance in this
parish, of a person, who, after having enjoyed the best state of health for the
space of 48 years of his age, unfortunately, by sleeping with a person deeply
tinctured with this distemper, in a small close room, caught the infection, and,
for 10 years past, has experienced all its dreadful effects; and indeed, for three
of these years, has been rendered incapable, in a great measure, of attending to
any business; and, after laying out, of a small income, a considerable sum of mo-
ney, on doctors, medicines, goat's whey, &c. endeavouring to get clear of the
distemper, he has little other hopes left, than to spin out the remainder of his
in the same woeful situation, and to wait for purification in the grave.
to be a warning to every individual in health, to beware with whom
left, they meet with the same fatal consequences.
