in thickness. It intersects the coal strata in a perpendicular direc-
tion, and in all likelihood to an impenetrable depth. It disjoins
the coal strata from 16 to 20 yards, and injures the seams of coal
for a few yards on each side, giving them a charred appearance,
but has no effect in elevating or depressing the strata on either side.
	The other dislocations of the strata in this coal-field, are known
by the name of steps or slips, and are of much more common oc-
currence than the dislocation or dike before-mentioned. These
slips * not only disjoin the coal strata, but throw them up or down,
from the extent of a foot to many fathoms.
	The first of these slips, east of Capon-craig-gaw, is known by
the name of the Turf-dike. Its direction is 25&deg; west of north.
This slip begins to be perceptible in a pit 40 fathoms deep, and
increases so to the dip, that at the depth of 50 fathoms, it is found
to be a slip of, 7 fathoms up to the east. This being the lowest
point where this dislocation has been touched, we may conclude
that it continues to increase towards the dip. The 2d slip east
from the Turf-dike is known by the name of the Piper-haugh slip.
Its direction is 350 west of north, and it throws the coal strata
20 fathoms up to the north-east. The 3d slip east from the Piper-
haugh is known bv the name of the No.5. slip. Its direction
is west of north 30&deg; and it throws the coal strata 7 fathoms down
to the north-east. The 4th slip east from No.5 is known by the
name of the Boghead slip. Its direction is 22&deg; west of north, and
it throws the coal strata 5 fathoms up to the north-east. The 5th
slip east from the Boghead slip is known by the name of the Mill-
dam slip. Its direction is 19&deg; west of north, and it throws the
strata 15 fathoms up to the eastward. The 6th slip east from the
Mill-dam slip is known by the name of the Tod-holes slip, being
found in the Tod-holes workings in the parish of Kilwinning. It
passes through the eastern extremity of this parish in the same di-
rection as the former, throwing the strata 4 fathoms up to the east-
ward. The 7th slip is in the east part of the Misk working. The
extent of this slip has not been ascertained, but it is one of a few
fathoms only.
	The only dislocation of the strata of any consequence, to the
west of the Capon-craig gaw, is known by the name of the Cu-
ninghame-head slip, which runs nearly in the same direction as the
slips previously mentioned. It is situated a little to the west of the
tower at Sea Bank, and is said to be a slip only of a few fathoms.

<FOOTNOTE>Step is the term used here, but slip is in more general use elsewhere.

	In general the S. W. is the prevalent wind; but in 1835, the
N.E. was predominant, and the others, counting the days, stood
in the following order: N. E., 87; S. W., 85; W., 54; S. 41;
N.W., 38; N., 28; S. E., 19 ; E., 13.
	Average height of the thermometer throughout the year 1835,
50&deg; 88/100. Average height of the barometer throughout the year
1835, 29.84.
	1835 was a cold year,--under our usual average temperature;
owing to the predominance of the north-east wind,--and the cloudi-
ness of the weather. Out of the 365 days, only 129 were clear
at the hour of taking the register.*
	Average height of the thermometer in barometer for the seve-
ral months of the year 1836, taken at 10 o'clock A. M., 72 feet
above the level of the sea at high water.
