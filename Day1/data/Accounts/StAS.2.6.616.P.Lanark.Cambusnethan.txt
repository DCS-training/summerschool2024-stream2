tions; and owing to the natural fertility of the soil and the warm
and sheltered situation, his is the most productive orchard upon
Clyde.
	The fruit was sold in 1828 for L. 402; 1829, L. 371; 1830,
L. 231; 1831, L. 317; 1832, L. 60; 1833, L. 485; 1834,
L. 180; 1835; L. 350, being at the average of L. 300 per annum.
And before the Glasgow market was so glutted with fruit of an
inferior description, by the facility of steam navigation, this or-
chard, when it had not arrived at its present state of maturity, has
some years brought the sum of L. 1000.
	There are in the parish upwards of 160 acres in orchard
ground. It is, however, less productive now than formerly; and
the spirit of planting orchards is at present on the decline. A
cyder press, however, has been lately established, and, if proper-
ly conducted, may tend to cause a reaction. In 1827, upwards
of L. 2300 was received for the orchards in this parish, besides
L. 400 for gooseberries and currants.
	Wishaw House, the seat of Lord Belhaven and Stenton, is si-
tuated on the River Calder, at the north-west corner of the pa-
rish. This mansion has been recently enlarged and beautifi-
ed, under the direction of Mr Gillespie Graham. The style of
architecture is the castellated; and the whole is a very successful
alteration of an ancient building. The front has an extremely
handsome appearance, the outline being much varied by the dif-
ferent heights and projections of the towers and embattled walls.
The apartments are suitable to the extent of the house, and some
of them are particularly worthy of examination for their beauty
and proportions. There are several excellent family portraits pre-
served at Wishaw House; one of Sir James Balfour, Lord Lyon,
King of arms in the reign of Charles I. by Vandyke, is reckoned
a very valuable painting. There is also a picture of John, Lord
Belhaven, who, in the reign of Queen Anne, made so strenuous
an opposition to the treaty of Union.
	Family of Belhaven.--The territorial possessions of this family
in the county of Lanark are very ancient. The peerage of Bel-
haven and Stenton was conferred on Sir John Hamilton of Biel,
in the county of Haddington, by Charles I. in 1647. The patent
was surrendered to Charles II. in 1695, and regranted by his Ma-
jesty with farther remainders.
	The father of the present Lord Belhaven succeeded to the
