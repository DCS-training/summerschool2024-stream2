valley also, there are favourable appearances of a clay marle.
But as no trial has been made of it, I cannot speak with cer-
tainty, either of its quantity or qualities.
   About a quarter of a mile south of the town, within 30
yards of Auchensterrie bridge, and 100 of the great canal,
there is a valuable and inexhaustible quarry of basaltes.
   The whin-stone rock is from 20 to 30 feet high; and as
there is very little surface upon it, it may be wrought at a
small expence; more especially, as it is in many places in-
tersected by horizontal and perpendicular fissures, whereby
it is cut into blocks of all different sizes.  It is peculiarly
adapted for causeways, or paving the streets of any populous
city.  The stone is solid, compact, and durable; yet though
extremely hard, and therefore capable of receiving a very fine
polish, it is very free, and easily formed into almost any shape.
The prevailing colour of it is a slate blue, beautifully freckled
with little white nodules.
   The demand for this stone has been considerable.  Several
thousand tons have been annually conveyed up the great ca-
nal to Glasgow, and the neighbourhood; and it is said to
be equal in quality to any stone that has been found.  Though
at the distance of 14 miles, as it is conveyed by water, it
can be furnished at as cheap a rate, as if it were within 3 or
4 miles of that city.
   I may add, that near the centre of this parish, in the Gar-
rel glen, about half a mile above the town, there is one of
the richest, finest, and most beautiful posts of free-stone in

   I have seen some of these myself, they are beautiful indeed.  Specimens of
each are in the possesion of Mr Robert Wilson at Banton, who has with much
labour and ingenuity, made a beautiful and pretty complete collection of the
minerals and fossils of this parish.  It would he a happy circumstance if there
was in every parish a cabinet or collection of the same kind.
