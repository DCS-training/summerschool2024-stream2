     of Madderty.

   Church.-The present church is situated about three-
fourths of a mile from the ruins of the Abbey.  It was
built in the year 1689, and is not in the best state of repair.
Lord Kinnoul is patron.  The stipend amounts to 9 chal-
ders of victual, and L. 29 Sterling, including the expence of
communion-elements.  The glebe consists of 9 acres of
land.  Manse and offices are in good repair.  Some of the
Seceding meetinghouses in the neighbourhood draw from
this parish a considerable number of hearers.

   School.-The parochial school is under excellent manage-
ment, and is deservedly in high repute.  It is attended by
numerous boarders from different parts of Scotland, but
chiefly England.  Mr David Malcolm, preacher of the
Gospel, is at present master, and teaches English, Latin,
Greek, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, mathematics,
land-measuring, &c.

   Poor.-The paupers on the parish-roll are commonly
about 4 or 5.  They are supported by the collections made
on Sabbaths at the church, which amount to about 2 s. 3 d.
each Sabbath.  There is also a fund of L. 90 Sterling, L. 29
of which were bequeathed by two heritors, lately deceased.
None of the poor are permitted to beg.

   Tradesmen.-The whole parish may be called agricultu-
ral; and the only places that may be denominated villages
are Bellycloine and Craigs; but as each of them consists of
a few houses only, they hardly deserve the name of villa-
ges.  Except a very small quantity of coarse linen, for the
Perth market, there is no manufacture here.  The quantity
of linen made must be small indeed, when it is considered
that there is only seven or eight weavers in the parish, and
these are chiefly employed in customary work.  This place
