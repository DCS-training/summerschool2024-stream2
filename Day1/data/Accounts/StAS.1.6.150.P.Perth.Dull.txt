miles from the church; here is a chapel in which the mission-
ary of Rannoch preaches every third Sunday.  And, 5. The
district of Fincastle, 15 miles from Appin, to which the minis-
ter travels across very high hills three or four times a year.
   There are various kinds of soil, as may be reasonably ex-
pected, in such an extensive tract of country.  The division
of Appin is flat: part of the soil is thick, but by much the
greater part is thin and gravellish.  It seems that the river Tay
had occasionally altered its bed, and consequently carried a-
way the earth, and left much sand and gravel.  There is a
great deal of hill, but the greater part of the parish is a corn
country.  In the higher tracts the arable ground is exceeding
good, and yields great crops, although they are seldom fertile,
being very late in ripening.  In this district the grain is of an ex-
cellent quality; and, in general, harvest here is as early as it is
in Mid Lothian.

   Lakes, Rivers, etc.-There are no less than 15 lakes in
the parish.  In all of them are to be found pike, trout, and eel.
Pike, which weighed upwards of 30 lbs. have frequently been
caught in Loch-Tumble.  There are several rives, but none
of them considerable, except the Tay and the Tumble.  The sal-
mon of the former is of an excellent quality; and the little of it
which is sold in the county sells at 6 d. per lb. during the spring
season, and about 3 d. in summer: little, however, is sold in
the parish, as the salmon are chiefly sent to Perth, and from
thence conveyed to the London Market.-The banks of the
Tay have a great tendency to oak-wood.  There are also very
large birch trees in the parish.

   Horses, Cows, and Sheep.-There are 1500 horses, 5000
cows, and 24,000 sheep in the parish.  Little care has been
hitherto taken to improve the wool, the particular attention of
