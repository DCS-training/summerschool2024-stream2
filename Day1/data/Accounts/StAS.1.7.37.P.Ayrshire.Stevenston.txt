   Hints for the Improvement the Parish.-The raising coals
from a depth of more than 50 fathoms, by double horse
gins, is very expensive.  There is a small neat steam engine
in the parish of Gorbals, a mile south of Glasgow, which,
under the management of a single man, performs the gin-
work in half the time, and with much greater effect than
any horse gin; raising large baskets full of coals alternately,
from a depth of about 60 fathoms.  At the sinking of a new
dip-pit, this improvement may be worthy of the attention
of our people, and, probably, many other improvements
which the inventive genius of the present age may produce.
Perhaps an able mechanic might, with little expence, com-
bine the Gorbals machinery, which is very simple, with
the machinery of every engine-pit, i. e. make a part of the
water raised by the pumps to raise the coal at the tame time.
If this be impracticable, the hint will be forgiven from one
who pretends to no skill in mechanics.

   It is very practicable to bring a part of the uninclosed 1700
acres of sandy ground in this parish into good culture and
pasture; it would, indeed, require a great sum to be expend-
ed in inclosing, levelling, and manuring, but would in the end
refund the expence many sold.  Three or four of the farms,
and part of the parks of the two proprietors, are already on the
skirts of that ground.  The soil, though pure sand, is very kind-
ly, more fit for the grass-husbandry than the clay soil; more fit
for potatoes than any soil whatsoever.  The loosest of the sand
makes excellent garden ground.  It will bear good wheat, which
has been raised on an acre of it in the glebe, and several acres
