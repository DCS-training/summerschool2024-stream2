     Statistical Account

   Rivers and Fish.- The rivers Esk and Liddel hold the
first rank; the former rising in the highest part of the
parish of Eskdalemoor, and the latter in the upper ex-
tremity of Liddesdale, or parish of Castleton.  Both,
after collecting in their different courses of nearly the
same extent of 23 or 24 miles, a great number of tri-
butary streams, meet at the southmost part of this pa-
rish; when the Liddel loses at once its name and waters
in the Esk; which, after running from the point of con-
fluence about 7 miles, in a S. W. direction, dischargos
its united streams into the Solway Faith.  The smaller
river of Tarras, having its source in the parish of
Ewes, and separating, on the N. E. quarter, this parish
from that of Langholm, is remarkable for its praerupt
channe, romantic seenery, and giving tittle of Earl to
Walter Scott of Highchefter, who married Lady Mary,
eldest daughter of Francis Earl of Buccleugh.  The pa-
tent bears date the 4th September 1660.  There are be-
sides, many burns or rivulates, which, in rainy seasons,
swell to a great size, but which, otherwise, do not me-
rit particular attention.  From the end of June, till
close-time, there is abundance of fish, after floods*, in
Esk, and the lower end of Liddel; such as salmon, grilse,
sea trout, and whitens, as they are named here, or her-
lings, as they are called in Annandale; and the common
river trouts are found in great plenty in all the rivers
and rivulets in the parish.  They are all excellent in
their kinds; but the Efk trouts and whitens, in parti-
cular, are, for their delicate flavour, highly prized.

<FOOTNOTE>

*A barricade of hewn stone made across the river, about 2 miles be-
low, by the late Dr. Grahame of Netherby, for the purpose of supplying
has mill with water, very much intercepts the run of the fish; and it is
only in time of flood they can easily make their way up the river.
