this growing evil?

   Pottery.-Near the bank of the Monkland Canal, was
erected, in 1785, a large brick and tyle work, where are ma-
nufactured blue, pan, and slate tyles, the first of the kind in
Scotland.  These tyles are preferable to red ones, in point
of durableness; and so similar are they, in shape and colour,
to slate itself, that it requires a nice eye to discover the diffe-
rence, when put on the roof.  The motive for fettling here
was the abundance of coal, and the vast variety of common
and fire clay that is found in the lands.  At the same place,
in 1788, Mr Creelman commenced a pot-work for making
salt ware; this manufacture is glazed with salt, which is

Scotland.  On the same grounds is a free-stone quarry, of a
superior quality, and beautiful white colour.  The stones are
carried to Glasgow by the Canal, where they are used for
hearths, stair-cares, and pavement; they are also sent to Ire-
land, America, and the West Indies.  It is so portable, that
you may have it from 1 to 6 inches thick, and in boards of a
yard square, and go smooth, as to require very little polishing:
A high value is fet on this stone.  About 70 people are em-
ployed at these works.

   Monkland Canal.-In the year 1770, an act of Parliament
was obtained for making a navigable cut or canal, from the
Monkland collieries to the city of Glasgow and the river
Clyde.  The design of the undertakers was to open an easy
