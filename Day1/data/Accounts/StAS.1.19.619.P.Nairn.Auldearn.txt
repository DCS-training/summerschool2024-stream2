     of Auldearn.

   Population.-In 1755 the population is said to have a-
mounted to 1951 souls.  This statement, however, is liable
to the suspicion of exaggeration; for the last incumbent, in
his unsuccessful application for an sugmentation of stipend
the preceding year, 1754, represented them as amounting
to only 1600 souls.  In an accurate list taken spring last
year (1796), the parish was found to contain 1406 inhabi-
tants; 661 makes, and 745 females.
   The total of those who follow the profession of agricul-
ture is 127.  Several mechanics and tradesmen possess small
crofts, in order to augment the means of subsistence for
themselves and families.  Of day-labourers there are 43,
11 shoemakers, 7 smiths, 15 weavers, 8 taylors, 7 millers,
11 masons, and 9 square-wrights; and there are 3 inns. and
4 merchants, in the village of Auldearn, which contains 41
houses, and 185 inhabitants.  There are about 97 sece-
ders of the Antiburgher persuasion, who, in conjuction with
some others, attached to that sect in the neighbouring pa-
rishes, contrive to support a clergyman of their own in Bog-
holl, in the south-east corner of the parish, and confines of
Edinkaillie.
   This secession from the communion of the established re-
ligion began about 40 years since, and is now rather on the
decline.  All the rest belong to the establishment, and join
with it, at least in religious ordinances, although their attach-
ment to puritanical doctrines makes many of them wander
miles to hear popular and applauded preachers.
