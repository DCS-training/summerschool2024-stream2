     Statistical Account

rule for calculation, the city does not appear to have re-
covered the same population it had in 1659, until near
the year 1720.
   The register of deaths appears to have been very regu-
lartly kept, from the year 1694 to 1777, after which there
is a blank for five years, owing to the person who kept the
register having become superannuated; but from 1783, it
has again been kept very regularly and exactly.  At the
beginning of this century, there were only two burying
grounds, but since that time others have been opened both
in the city and suburbs.  And, as a number of the inhabi-
tants of Glasgow are buried in these church-yards in the
suburbs, and some of the inhabitants of the suburbs are in-
terred within the city, it is necessary to take the numbers
in all these burying grounds, in order to ascertain the popu-
lation and increase of the inhabitants.  The following ta-
ble exhibits the average number for every 10 years, from
the beginning of this century to the present time, of bap-
tisms, proclamations of banns and burials.  But it must be
remarked, that the register of baptisms and proclamations
relate only to the royalty, whereas the bills of mortality
include also the suburbs.
