lies, whose education is too much neglected.  This, how-

quors, and the number of inns, and houses for selling spirits.
Of there there are no less than 18 in Stevenston town, and
16 in Saltcoats, 34 in the whole parish; an evil which ought

has very melancholy consequences on the health, the indus-

vices of foreign countries than the generality of that class of
men.  During the American war, it was computed that
