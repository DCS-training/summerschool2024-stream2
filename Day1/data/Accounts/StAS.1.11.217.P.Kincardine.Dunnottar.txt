commonly employed from this parish.  The fish caught are cod,
ling, had lacks, whitings, and flounders; besides a considerable
quantity of crabs and lobsters, which are mostly consumed in
the neighbourhood.  Some kelp is made along this coast,
once in three years, the sea weed requiring that time to grow.
But the quantity very inconsiderable.

   Town and Harbour.-At the N. E. corner of the parish,
where the Carron runs into the sea, is situated the small town
of STONEHAVEN, or STONEHIVE.  The principal circumstance
observable with respect to it, is its harbour, for which there
is the best natural situation.  It is a bason, sheltered from the
S. E. by a very high rock, which stands out into the sea;
and on the N. E. there is a head, or quay, which in some
measure defends it from that quarter.  At high tides there is
a depth of 22 feet water at the entrance.  If the present quay
were carried farther out, and another built opposite to it, ves-
sels could lie in perfect safety.  And it would be of the utmost
importance to all the shipping upon the E. coast of Scotland,
that some improvement of this kind were made: For there
is not a harbour betwixt the Frith of Forth and Cromarty,
that vessels in distress can so easily get into; as all the sea-
faring people can bear witness.  A small aid from govern-
ment would be requisite for this improvement, to be joined
to the shore-dues and private contributions.

   Commerce and Government.-There is very little trade here,
except by 3 or 4 small vessels, which are employed for sup-
plying the neighbourhood, in bringing lime and coals from
Sunderland and the Frith of Forth, with a few cargoes of
wood, iron and slax from the Baltic*.  The town consists of
