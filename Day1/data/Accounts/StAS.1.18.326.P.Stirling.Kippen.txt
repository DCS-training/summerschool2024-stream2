hills of Boquhan and Glinns, is very narrow at the eastern
extremity.  Towards the west, the country is more open.
From the southern boundary, most of the baronies in this
parish are laid off, parallel to each other, down to the sides
of the Forth.  The dryfield of Kippen forms the greater part
of that hill, which, commencing at the bridge of Boquhan,
and extending through the whole of this parish, and part of
the parishes of Balfron and Drymen, terminates about a mile
westward from the village of Balfron.  The land which lies
on its northern declivity, forms the main body of the parish
of Kippen, and exhibits a pleasing view of fruitful fields,
generally well inclosed, and occasionally intersected with glens
and rivulets.

   Moor of Kippen.-Towards the summit and southern decli-
vity of the hill, on which it hath been observed, that the
greater part of this parish is situated, there is an extensive
moor, called the moor of Kippen, which runs the whole
length of the parish, and comprehends also part of Balfron.
On the south side, the ground which is lighter, and not so
good as that on the north side of the hill, slopes gradually for
half a mile or more, and is terminated by a small rivulet cal-
led the Pow of the Glinns, which divides Kippen from Bal-
fron.  This water runs eastward, till it falls into the burn of
Boquhan, which again forms the boundary between Kippen
and Gargunnock, and empties itself into the Forth, at the
bridge of Frew.  Another small stream, west from the for-
mer, takes a different course, and runs westward into the
water of Endrick, which finally goes into the Clyde.  Under
the mosses in the moor of Kippen, are found some oaks and
other trees, though not so large as those in the low moss on
the sides of the Forth.  It is probable that the whole dryfield
has been covered with wood, mostly oak; for on the sides of
