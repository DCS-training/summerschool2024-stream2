1792.  Another mas opened for public worship, at lovern, in the
south-eastern district of the parish, on the 23d of March 1835, to
which a pastor has been since ordained.  In the burgh  three
similar places of worship have been erected, called the North
Church; Martyr's, Church; and the South Church; and all of
them are already provided with ordained clergymen.  A great ad-
dition has been thus made to the church accommodation and pas-
toral superintendence of our destitute population.  Still, however,
unless these places of worship be so endowed as to admit of a num-
ber of seats being set apart for the poor, and the whole let at very
moderate rents, the objects of an establishment will be but partial-
ly answered.
   The additional church accommodation, obtained in consequence
of these erections, may be stated ds follows:

   Theere is thus church accommodation to the amount of  12,774

sittings provided by the Establishment, for the whole population
of the town and parishe's of Paisley, amounting to 57,880.  To
each of the clergymen of these new churches, a bond of provision is
granted, varying from L. 80 to L. 100.  But it is understood that
the bond shall merely specify the minimum stipend, while it is ex-
pected that the income will always considerably exceed that small
sum.  Besides his stipend, the minister of the Gaelic Church has
a manse, lately built for him, by his congregation.
   The small amount of church accommodation, as well as pastoral
superintendence provided by the Establishment in this place, would
have been more severely felt by our population, had it not been
for the laudable exertions of our dissenting brethren, who, to a con-
siderable extent, have remedied the evil.  In these parishes, there
are eleven different churches belonging to presbyterian dissenters
viz. one to the Reformed Presbytery; one to the  Old Burghers;
three to the Relief and six to the United Secession.  There are
also several bodies of Independents, including Methodists, Baptists,
Glassites, Unitarians, and Universalists.  In Paisley, there is also
an Episcopal chapel, which was recently erected, and in the new
town, is the only Roman Catholic ChapeL within the bounds of
this presbytery.  The duties of the priest extend to a population
