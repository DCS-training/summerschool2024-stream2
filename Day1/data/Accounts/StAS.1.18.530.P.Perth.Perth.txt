   The late Earl of Kinnoul exerted himself in obtaining a
new bridge to be erected over the Tay, in 1766.  Besides
what was given by individuals, and by different societies in
the town, L. 2000 was given from the public revenue.  The
magistrates have agreed to join with the county in erecting a
bridewell; but the execution of this scheme is necessarily de-
layed till the times shall be more peaceable.

     SS16. Ecclesiastical State.

   The parish church of Perth is a large and ancient building,
and bears a resemblance to the form of a cross.  It is now
divided into what are called the east, middle, and west
churches.  The east church is the most modern part of the
building.  It contains what was formerly called the choir,
and was built about the year 1400, after the old choir had
been taken down.  It is in the best stile of Gothic architec-
ture, and was lately furnished, in a very elegant manner,
with seats and galleries.
   The parish church, which had been dedicated to St John
Baptist, the manse which belonged to it, and another house
in Perth, with the whole tithes of the parish, were given by
Malcolm Canmore, and confirmed by his sons Alexander I.
and David I. to the abbey of Dumfermling.  The abbot and
Monks received the rectory tithes, and employed a vicar to
officiate at Perth.
   At the reformation of religion, the property of the abbeys,
and of other such religious houses, reverted to the crown.
   King James VI. in 1589, at the time of his marriage with
Ann of Denmark, conferred on her the lands and other pro-
perty of the abbey of Dumfermling.  This deed was confirm-
ed by Acts of Parliament, in 1593; but it was enacted that
she should allow for the officiating clergy, and for some other
purposes specified, one third of the benefices of those churches
