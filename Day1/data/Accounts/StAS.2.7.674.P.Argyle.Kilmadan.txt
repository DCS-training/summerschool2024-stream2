674                       ARGYLESHIRE.

   The fishing of salmon and trout in the river Ruel was formerly
remarkably good, but of late, in consequence of the prevalence of
netting along the arms of the sea, the number of fish of all kinds
in this river has very much decreased.
   Several smacks belonging the parish, which are employed in
summer at the herring-fishing, trade from the mouth of the Ruel
to the adjacent ports on the frith of the Clyde in the export of
potatoes (for which this parish is famed,) and generally return
laden with manure for the farmers. The average tonnage of these
vessels is from 12 to 30 tons.
