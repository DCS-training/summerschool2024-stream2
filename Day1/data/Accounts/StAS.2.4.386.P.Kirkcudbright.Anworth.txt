parish; and the old line by the Corse of Slakes (which was by
far the steepest and the longest road-ascent in Galloway), has
been virtually abandoned ; the Fleet canal has been con-
structed ; a new church and manse have been built; the church
collections have risen from L.14 to L.40; the stipend has been
tripled; the schoolmasters salary has advanced from L.11 to
L.34, 4s. 4 1/2d. ; the rental of the parish has been doubled; the
houses of the farmers, and their general style of living, have been
much improved; superstitious opinions aregreatly weakened, if
not eradicated, unless on the part of the older portion of the po-
pulation, or in the more remote and thinly inhabited districts of
the parish; the wages of labour have increased about 25 per
cent., while the price of the leading articles of food, meal and
potatoes, for example, is about the same as in 1794; butcher-
meat being a little higher, but clothing much cheaper. Indeed
as to female servants, their wages are stated at L.1, 15s. per half
year at that date: They now vary from L.2, 10s. to L.3. Peat
was the only fuel used in the parish, except by the resident
heritors, in 1794 ; about equal quantities of coal (brought from
the opposite coast of Cumberland) and peat are now burnt. The
number of paupers, however, has risen, within the last fifty years,
from 10 to 21. The church collections, and the usual parochial
revenue were, in 1794, sufficient for their relief; now, though all
these sources of income have become more ample, the heritors
have to advance a yearly sum of about L.30. On the whole,
however, the standard of living and the means of comfort among
all classes are greatly elevated, and the character and condition
of the people have been improved.
