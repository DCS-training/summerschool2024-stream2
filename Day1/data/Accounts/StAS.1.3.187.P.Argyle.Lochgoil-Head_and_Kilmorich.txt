     of Lochgoil head and Kilmorich.

L. 200, five who pay above L. 100, and five who pay above
L. 50 Sterling of yearly rent; the rest, to the number of 35,
are small tenants, and pay from L. 10 to L. 40 Sterling a
year.  The tacksmen are opulent, comfortably lodged, and
live with great decency; the tenants are also easy in their
circumstances, and enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts
and advantages of society.  The land in general is let upon
very reasonable terms.  This is chiefly owing to the late Sir
James Campbell of Ardkinglass, who did not with to oppress
his people, but took pleasure in seeing them prosperous and
happy.  The benevolence and moderation of that gentleman
will be long and gratefully remembered in this country.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the roll of the parish at
present, is 25; they are supported by the money collected in
the church on Sundays, which, at an average, amounts to
near L. 24 Sterling a year.  This fund is distributed to the 
poor, according to their repective circumstances.

   Church.-There are two churces in this parish, one at
Lochgoil-head, where the manse is, and the other at Cairndow,
near Kilmorich, upon Loch-fine side.  The minister preaches
two Sabbaths at Lochgoil-head, and the third Sabbath at
Cairndow:  Both the churches are old, and in bad order; the
manse was built about 80 years ago, and is now undergoing
a thorough repair.  The living, including two glebes, one at
Lochgoil-head, and the other at Kilmorich, may be valued
at L. 130 Sterling.  Sir Alexander Campbell of Ardkinglass,
Baronet, is patron, and chief heritor.  The family of Ard-
kinglass have had the principal property in this parish, for
many centuries.  There is no Seceder nor Roman Catholic
in it.
