   Miscellaneous Facts.-Peats are the only fuel used here.
The roads are kept in pretty good repair by the statute
labour, though this is not fully sufficient.  There are no
turnpikes.-There are at present 7 ale-houses or tippling
houses, but two of them are so only occasionally.  Their
effect upon the morals of the people is in general very im-
material.  Their sale indeed is very inconsiderable, unless
from the fishermen's families, who buy their ale every day
as they need it.  Indeed, chiefly by them, and travellers,

Under tenants work only at most and sold; if they are called

the mills no multure is paid, but for services much the
same as already mentioned-.Ellon is the nearest post-office,
and is about 5 English miles distant.  There are no unin-
habited houses in the parish, nor have any additional ones
been built for years past.

   Proposed Improvements.-The chief, and indeed the only
effectual means of bettering the condition of the people, would
be to grant them longer leases, even although it should be at a
rising rent.  In this country, leases are seldom granted for
more than 19 years.  As the present tacksman is far from
being sure of renewing his lease, during the last 3 or 4 years
of it, he saves all expences, and takes out all the strength he
