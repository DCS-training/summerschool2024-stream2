     Statistical Account

Scotch plough only is employed, and hitherto clumsily made;
but some even of the small farmers are getting them neatly
made, and pay from 30 s. to 40 s. for a plough.  In short, it
is neither want of skill, nor enterprise, that chiefly retard the
progress of agriculture here, but other causes, some of which
it may be proper to mention.
   Though there is a vast extent of stone walls reared in most
parts of the parish, yet there are few or no inclosures, except
those about gentlemen's seats.  The farms are all either
quite open, or destitute of sufficient senses; while cattle of
every species are allowed to roam at large through the arable
fields, from the time the corn crop is carried home, till the
succeeding crop begins to rise.  A great many of the farms
are too small; being from 5 to 7 acres of arable ground.  A
farm of this size as effectually bars the poffessor and one of his
children from every other line of industry, as one of double or
triple the extent.  Hence the small tenants are poor, except
they are weavers; in which last case they live very comforta-
bly.  The want of lime and marle is another great disadvantage.
Lime cannot be had nearer than the port of Perth, which is
12 miles from the nearest, but 25 from the remotest parts of
the parish.  Good marle is nor less distant.  Some resource
may be found at a future period from a great body of marle,
on the orders of the parish of Auchtergavon, if the proprie-
tors drain and expose it to sale.  This disadvantage with respect
to fossil manures, is aggravated by the trouble and difficulty at-
tending peat, the pricipal fuel in this country.  Though peat
be abundant enough, yet the casting, winning, and carrying
them home occupy the greatest part of the months of June and
July, the season most convenient for bringing home lime and
marle.
   These evils cannot be removed, nor event muc alleviated,
without great judgement and attention on the part of the land-
