most unhappy influence, as well on the health as the morals
of the people.  Even the honest and industrious labourer
is sometimes inadvertenly drawn into this destructive prac-
tice.  Exhausted by his daily labour, and at times by more
violent exertion, he feels the necessity of some cordial to
recruit the wasted powers of nature, and simply swallows
a poison for a cordial; he feels from it a temporary slow of
animal spirits but is not aware that it wastes the constitu-

chapels in this parish.  One of these, which stood in the

for many families in the parish and neighbourhood.  This
part of the parish, which is entirely separated from the
rest, by an interjacent part of the parish of Dumbarnie,
bears the name of Eccelasiamagrirdle, the origin of which is
uncertain; but probably has been given in honour of some
saint; some explain it to signify "The church of St Mag-
