of Nithsdale, in the parish, which could not, at that time,
exceed L. 12. sterling.-The best arable land, may be valu-
ed at 15 s per acre, the inferior at 6 s or 7 s.  But, as there is
scarce a farm, that has not a great proportion of barren land,
this can give no idea of the rent per acre.  Some farms are
rented from L. 60. to L. 100. others as low as from L. 10. to
L. 20. but the general run is about L. 40.  The farms are di-
vided from one another, by march dykes, but few of them
so subdivided as to encourage a proper plan of improve-
ment.

   Church, Patron, Poor, etc.-The church was built in the
times of Property; it was last repaired in 1786.  The manse was
built in 1730; and repaired in 1777.  The value of the living,
including the glebe, is estimated at L. 90.-The patron
is the Duke of Queensberry.-The annual amount of the 
funds for the relief of the poor, is per annum, about L. 20,
out of which, eight persons recieve a quarterly allowance.
Others receive alms occasionally.  None of the poor beg from
door to door; but scarcely a day passes, that the parish is not
visited with vagrant poor, from neighbouring parishes, or
from Ireland.-In 1782 and 1783, when there was a ge-
neral scarcity over the country, the crops in this district
were, at least, as good as usual; and though the harvest
was late, the crops were got fasely in.  The farmers were so
grateful for the plenty they enjoyed, and were so sensible of
the hardships a number of families might suffer from the high
price of provisions, that they stored up a considerable quanti-
ty of oat-meal, to be sold to such of their neighbours as stood
in need of a supply, at 1 s. 8 d. per stone, though at that time
the market price was 2 s. 4 d.
