   Public Amusements.-During the winter season, there are
dancing assemblies once a-fortnight.
   Occasionally we have academical concerts of music.
   Sometimes the heroes and heroines of the Sock and Bu-
skin favour us with a visit, and fret a few of their summer
hours on our little stage.

   Circulating Library.-Banff affords a choice circulating
library, which, besides the usual light summer reading of the
times, contains a select collection of the works of eminent
writers, both ancient and modern.
   From our constant intercourse with London by sea, we
have early access to the periodical and other publications of

here, in the course of the month succeeding their publi-

   A Book Society is at present forming, on a liberal plan,
to consist of 20 gentlemen.

   Eminent Men.-Under this article may be mentioned the
Bairds of Auchmedden, a very ancient and respectable fa-
mily, long resident in Banff*.
