periment, bought one of Mr Bakewell's bulls.  He put the
half of his cows to this, and the other half to a Moorland
bull, bred upon his own estate.  He fed the product equal-

   Sheep and Wool.-Our Sheep are of five kinds.  In the up-
per part of this parish, where there are two sheep farms, the
flocks are of two different kinds: the one, a small sheep, with
flecked or sprittle face and legs, and fine wool.  This breed
has been from time immemorial in the country.  The other,
black faced and black legged, with large coarse wool, brought
lately from the head of Nithsdale.  The wool of the first kind
sells at from 8 s. to 10 s. per stone; the wool of the other at
from 4 s. to 6 s.  In the lower part of the parish, there is the
long legged English Mug, with wool, long, fine, and sit for
combing; and the broad short legged, fine, short woolled
kind, called the Culley breed.  There is a fifth breed, of the
small, white faced, short fine woolled species, which differ in
nothing from the Cheviot breed.  The wool of these different
kinds sells at from 12 s. to 16 s. per stone: 28 lb.  Avoirdupois
makes our stone of wool.  Lord DAER, who, in many in-

benefit of this improvement.

mentioned wood at the old Castle of Cumpston.  There are
