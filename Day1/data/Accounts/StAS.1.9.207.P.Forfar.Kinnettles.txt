writer of the Roman department of the Universal History,
is said to have been a native of this parish.-The people
in general are of an equal degree of strength, compared
with the inhabitants of other counties in Scotland.  We
have some who may be accounted strong.  One man, in
particular, might stand high in the list of strong men in
any county of Britain.  The tallest man, within our
bounds, wants, I think, about half an inch of 6 feet high.
They are of different sizes, from about 6 feet down to 5
feet 4 or 5 inches, perhaps a very few below that height.
The ordinary stature is about 5 feet 7 inches.  Women,
in general, are about 5 feet high.  Exclusive of shoes, we
have ladies, whose height is from 5 feet 4 to 5 feet 7 in-
ches.  The complexions of the people, are some ruddy,
some pale.  They have all, however, a healthy appear-
ance; and are pretty remarkable for an acuteness of ge-
nius, which enables them to attain to dexterity in the dif-
ferent occupations in which they employ their talents.-
The people are very much disposed to industry.  The on-
ly manufacture is green linen, or osnaburgh.  There are
58 hands employed in that branch of weaving.  We have
a spinning mill for flax yarn.  It is on a small scale, in-
tended to contain 120 pirns.  A corn mill is converted to
that purpose.  It is in contemplation of the Company to
extend their plan, if the experiment now making shall an-
swer their expectations.  In the mean time, they are busy
adjusting their apparatus, of which they have made trial;
and the yarn which it throws, looks well, and is thought
to be of a very good quality.  This work is carrying on
by virtue of a lease of patent privilege from a Company
in England.-We have but very few instances of fondhess
for a seafaring life.  Nor are the people much addicted
to a military one: the army not having, at any period, in
the memory of man, obtained any considerable supply
