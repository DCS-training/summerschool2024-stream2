must be a great improvement to plant larches instead of
thorns, for fences, in all these kinds of soils which cannot
afford a sufficient quantity of moisture to make thorns pros-
per.  And even in rich soils, and those which afford plenty
of moisture for thorns, it will be found, that larches will
sooner become a fence than thorns, and with much less trou-
ble and expence.

   Hills, Fuel, Game, etc-There are no hills in this parish,
excepting the hill of Cochrage, belonging to Mr Campbell
of Achalader; and it merits rather the names of a muir and
moss, than that of a hill.  It is of a considerable extent, and
contains a great quantity of peat-moss.  On this moss, the
inhabitants of this country, to the distance of a considerable
number of miles to the south-east of the moss, used princi-
pally to depend for their fuel, peat and turf.  But now that
the attention of the farmers is much taken up in the sum-
mer season, with improvements in agriculture, the inhabi-
tants of this parish and neighbourhood, (excepting those re-
siding near the moss) principally depend for fuel upon coals,
driven from the shores of Perth and Dundee.
   In this hill of Cochrage, there are a good many grouse or
muir-fowl, and a few heath-fowl or black-cock.  There were
no heath-fowl to be seen in this parish or neighbourhood,
till within these few years.  They came from the woods and
muirs in the neighbourhood of Dunkeld, and are now to be
seen in almost every muir in this neighbourhood, where there
is plenty of heath for food, and wood for shelter.  The nu-
merous rising plantations are also beginning to invite the
roe-deer, which, till within these few years, had not, for
some ages past, made their abode in these lower parts of this
country.
