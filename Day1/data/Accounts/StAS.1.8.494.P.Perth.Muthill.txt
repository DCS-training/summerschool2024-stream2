4 ditches, which, with its natural advantages, rendered this
side as strong and as secure as any of the ochers.  The 4 en-
tries crossing the lines, at right angles, are still distinctly to be
seen.
   The area of the camp is an oblong of 140 yards, by 125
within the lines.  The General's Quarter rises above the level
of the camp, but is not in the center.  It is a regular square,
each side being exactly 20 yards.  At present, it exhibits evi-
dent marks of having been inclosed with a stone wall, and
contains the foundations of a house, 10 yards by 7.  That a
place of worship has been erected here, is not improbable,
as it has obtained the name of Chapel Hill from time imme-
morial.
   Besides the camp above mentioned, so completely fortified
both by nature and art, (and which is supposed to have been
formed by Agricola, for the Roman legions under his com-
mand,) there are other two encampments adjoining to it, and
having a communication with one another, containing above
130 acres of ground.  These seem to have been defended by
only a single ditch and rampart, and probably were intended.
for the cavalry and auxiliaries.  Here was room for all the
forces, that fought under Agricola near the Grampian moun-
tains, notwithstanding what has been said by Mr. Gordon, in
his Itinerarium Septentrionale, to the contrary; who probably
imagined, as others have done since, that the whole ground at
Ardoch, fortified by the Romans, lay within the small camp
above mentioned.
   It has already been observed, that the two large encampments
had a communication with one another; and, that there was a
subterraneous passage from the small one, under the bed of
the river, is more than probable, from a circumstance now
to be mentioned.  There was a hole near the side of the prae-
torium, that went in a sloping direction for many fathoms;
