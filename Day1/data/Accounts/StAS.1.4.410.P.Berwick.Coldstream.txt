     NUMBER LV.

     PARISH OF GOLDSTREAM.

     (COUNTY OF BERWICK).

     By JAMES BELL, D. D.

     Name, Situation, Soil, Air, etc.

   The ancient name of the parish was Lennel, and the
ruins of Lennel church, distant from Coldstream a-
bout a mile and a half nearly, still remain.  Eastward from
this church there was formerly a little town of village call-
ed Lennel, which was so entirely destroyed in the Border
wars, that the site of it is not known to me.  Goldstream
was the seat of a priory or abbacy which belonged to the
Cistertian order, and was situated near the Tweed, where a
small water, called Leet, falls into it.  Of this ancient struc-
ture a vault only remains.  It is probable that a village
was formed near it, which, from the pleasantness of the si-
tuation, and the protection afforded by the abbacy to the
inhabitants, incresed to the size of a small town.  Before
General Monk marched into England to restore the Royal
Family, he made Goldstream his head quarters, and raised
that body of men, which, being in succession recruited, has
been called ever since the Goldstream Regiment of Guards.-
