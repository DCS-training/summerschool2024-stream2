   Birds.-To mention the feathered race might here seem
to be a matter of levity; but when it is considered that they,
perhaps, of all living creatures, have the most delicate sensa-
tions, as to climate and the state of the air; that nature has
enabled, and even instructed them, to choose or to change
their residence accordingly; and that their appearance or ab-
sence may afford no contemptible estimate of the increasing
warmth or cold of any country, (things much connected with
the state of agriculture), one may venture to hazard ridicule
on this subject.  Perhaps inattention to subjects not visibly
important, and ignorance of natural history, might hinder
our ancestors from remarking upon birds any ways singular.
If that has not been the case, this country has lately been
frequented by several that used seldom to appear in Scotland.
Since some groves of pines came to be of a respectable
growth, the cross-bill has been frequently seen, and it is be-
lieved breeds in the country.  The bull-finch is common, and
pheasants have been observed, which, in all probability, must
have come from England.  Quails, hardly known a few years
ago, are now in abundance.  In hard winters, too, the Bohe-
mian chatterer, and even some Arctic birds have visited us.
The common moor and black game have disappeared from
this parish, since agriculture became extensive, and the heath,
broom, furze, etc. were destroyed.  Other game would be
very plenty, but the game laws have never been rigorously
executed in this part of the country, unless when people
break fences, disturb cattle, and do the farmers wanton mis-
chief in the course of their amusement.

   Minerals.-As to minerals or fossils, little can be here
mentioned, serving either to gratify curiosity, or prompt in-
dustry.  Rock crystals, but of no great brilliancy, are often
found.  Talcs and spars of several kinds are pretty frequent-
