   A cart of dung in Glasgow, by the time it is carried to the
dunghill without the town, costs 1 s. 6 d.; but this cart is
so large, that two of them make three of those that are
brought to the coutry, which therefore cost only 1 s. each.
The expence of carriage depends on the distance; but the
carriage of one cart to the distance of 6 miles, cannot be esti-
mated at less than 1 s. 6 d. and it requires 45 carts to dung
an acre of land for wheat.  Besides dung, lime is also com-
monly employed.  The lime is brought from the neigh-
bouring parish of Kilbride.  When carried to the distance
of 4 miles, it costs about 10 s. the chalder, and 4 chalders,
are necessary for an acre of wheat land.  The whole ex-
pence, therefore, of preparing and sowing an acre of land
with wheat, at the distance of 6 miles from Glasgow, and
4 miles from Kilbride, supposing every article to be paid
in money, may be estimated thus:

   It may well be supposed, that the farmer's labour and ex-
pence will seldom be paid by the first crop; but if it be
nearly paid, he must be a considerable gainer; for land,
which has been treated in this manner, will be in such or-
der, that he will be amply repaid by the succeeding crops.
The practice of planting potatoes in the fields, was introdu-
ced about the same time with that of sowing wheat, and is
now common over all the parish.  Though potatoes cost a
great deal of work, yet they not only make a plentiful re-
turn, but also leave the ground in such a condition, that
the farmers sow it with wheat, and have a good crops, but
