which is between five and six miles from the shore, or west-
ern extremity; so that the greater length of the parish, from
E. to W. is little less than 6 miles; its greatest breadth, from
N. to S. is between 3 and 4 miles; and from thence it les-
sens gradually towards the west, till it comes to the shore, to
one mile and a half.  The soil is nowhere rocky, but for
the most part deep and wet, and not very fertile naturally;
yet every part of it is improveable, and generally much im-
proved of late years, both in respect of crops and elegant
plantations.  There are no lime quarries in the parish; but
they have lately found, in some places of the higher grounds,
a kind of blue marle, which has been used with success.
There is much limestone daily imported from Ireland, in the
coal vessels.

   Agriculture-has made great progress here, as well as in
other parts of the country, within the last thirty or forty
years.  The lands of Alloway, being the full half of the pre-
sent country parish of Ayr, were formerly possessed by te-
nants at the yearly rent of 1 s. 3 d. per acre, which they were
not able to pay, and often became bankrupts and beggars.
In the year 1755, these lands were sold by the town to pri-
vate proprietors, who continue to pay the ancient rent as a
perpetual feu-duty, and the sale produced a capital of L. 7200.
Since that period, the lands have been brought into good
cultivation, and are now finely inclosed, and adorned with
plantations and country seats; Rossell, Doonnholm, Green-
field, Mount-Charles, Bellisle, etc.
   The lands of Borrowfield, the other division of the coun-
try parish of Ayr, seem to have been alienated from the
town at some far distant period, when money was extremely
scarce; for though they still pay a feu-duty, it is a mere trifle,
compared with what is paid for the Alloway lands.
