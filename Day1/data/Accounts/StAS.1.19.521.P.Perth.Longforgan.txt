after this, it became a practice with proprietors to give te-
nants 19 years, and also their own life added; upon the
principle, that a man would certainly keep that farm in good
order, which he was to posses during his life.  However,
that has been found to be fallacious, as there are many
wealthy farmers now, although not in this parish, who after
their certain time is out, grudge to lay out a shilling more
upon their farms, left they should not live long enough to
get its value out of the ground; and there are large farms
now falling into decay from this cause.  So that from ex-
perience it would appear, that the best terms for a tack
(lease), is a certain fixed period of years; if the farms
be improved, perhaps 19 years is as good as any; although
the odd year is not easy to be accounted for, unless upon
an inveterate partiality for odd numbers; for certainty,
eighteen years, or three rotations, is much more natural; but
if unimproved, the lease should be longer, to encourage the
tenant to lay out his money.

   Present Condition of Tacks or Leases.-Now, the terms of
all new tacks or leases are generally for 19 years to them-

tenant subset.  He must reside with his family and fier,
i. e. his horses, servants, and cattle, upon the farm; not to
fells any fodder; hay and wheat-straw for thatch excepted.
He is to lay the whole dung he makes upon the farm.  He
is in general bound to the rotation of fixes:  But now it is
thought sufficient to bind the tenants not to sow any white
crop upon the clay, i. e. wheat, oats, or barley; but after
fallow or green crop, which are declared to be lint, clover,
beans, pease, tares, and the like; and to keep one half
of the farm under these crops during the currency of
the lease; and the fame upon the rich loam; potatoes,
yams, and turnips, or any such, are amongst the interme-
