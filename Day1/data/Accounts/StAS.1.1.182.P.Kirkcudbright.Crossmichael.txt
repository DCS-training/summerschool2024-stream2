     Statistical Account

   Antiquities.-There are in this parish ten irregular heaps of
loose stones, which antiquaries called Pictish cairns.  Three
of these have been opened by persons still alive; and in each
of them some human bones have been found, in coffins
considerably above the ordinary size.  There are several
moats, as in other parts of Scotland; remains of antient and
later fortifications.  The foundations of a very large convent
was lately discovered, about which record and tradition are
silent.  Farmers in ploughing, and labourers in digging, have
frequently found Roman urns, swords, and other imple-
ments.

   Language, and Etymology of Names of Places.-The language
spoken here is neither English nor Scottish, but a mixture
of both.  With the exception of a few provicial words and 
phrases, the inhabitants speak with more propriety than those
of the same station in most part of Scotland.  The names of
places are derived from the English, the Gaelic, and from
combinations of both.  Many of them are descriptive of the 
situations of places, or of their dependence on the church, etc.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages of this
place, as must appear from what haht been said, are very con-
siderable.  The chief disadvantages which is labours under,
are the scarcity and dearness of fuel, and the length and bad-
ness of the roads over which is must be brought.  The plough
has almost totally removed the whins, and other brush-wood,
which formerly were of material service to the poor.  As there
are few mosses in the parish, most of the peats must be brought
from the distance of 4 to 5 miles; and even there the proprie-
tors will scarcely dispose of them at any price.  Some people
bring coals, by land carriage, 40 miles from Damellington in
Airshire.  This country might be furnished with English coals,
