    Of Insects the variety is great, particularly of the Lepidopterous
class. They are only such, however, as `re common in other parts
of the country and, excepting those that have lately proved inju-
rious to the husbandman or the horticulturist, are scarcely worthy
of being specified. Among these exceptions ir the wheat-fly, a
creature so tiny that its existence is endangered even by the com-
motion caused among the stalks and leaves of wheat by a slight
breeze. Yet, under particular circumstances, with all, its apparent
insignificance, it might in the course of a few days not only ma-
terially abridge the farmer's wealth, but bring a nation to the verge
of famitie. This is not the place to enter into a minute history
of its nature and habits, or to do any thing more than make a few
general statements regarding it. The name of the wheat-fly has
been given it on account of its affection for the wheat-plant, for
though when under necessity it will betake itself to barley, to most
if not to all the varieties of the Triticum genus it discovers a
peculiar attachment. It is not, however, as a devourer of food
for its own sustenance, but as a foreseeing provider of it for its
progeny, that it seeks the wheat-plant. Depositing its eggs within
the flumes of the wheat about the time when it comes in ear,
these speedily are transformed into living worms, in various num-
bers, from one to six. These worms fix upon the vessels intend-
ed to carry the juices of the plant to the point where the grain is
formed and nourished, and, cutting off the communication between
the sap-channels and the embryo corn, they appropriate for their
own aliment what in due time would have swelled and hardened
into good fruit. At the time that the worms or maggots come
to maturity, being then about one-tenth of an inch in length, the
ears of wheat may be seen covered with multitudes of a small in-
sect call the Tipula Tritici. This is a blind, but in its own pe-
culiar way, an active and ardent destroyer of the wheat-fly. It
watches the maggots, (supplying its defect of sight by incessant.
