     vanus, or Serf of Moivard, to the monastery of Inchaffray.
     Whereas, on the other hand, Keith, in his "History of the
     Church and State in Scotland"  (B. iii.  App. p. 191,) includes
     Strowan in the list of the parsonages or parochial churches in
     Scotland remaining unappropriated to bishops or religious houses
     at the time of the Reformation.  The exact period at which Mo-
     nivaird and Strowan were united, is involved in obscurity, but it is
     evident, from the reports of, the Commissioners of Teinds from
     1661 to 1673, that the union had taken place previous to the year
     1662.  Each parish had its own church, in which Divine worship
     was observed every alternate Sabbath, and the communion dispens-
     ed every alternate year, until 1804, when a new church was erected:
     in a central situation, equally convenient for both parishes.  The
     population being considerably scattered, the majority are from one
     to two miles from the place of public worship, while very few in-
     dividuals are distant above three miles.  The church is in good
     repair, and affords accommodation for 600 persons.  All the sit-
     tings are free.  It is a remarkable fact, that the incumbency of
     the two last ministers extended over the long period of 105 years;
     the Rev. James Porteous having been ordained 4th August 1720,
     died 25th November 1780; the Rev. Colin Baxter, ordained 23d
     August 1781, died 5th January 1835.  The present incumbent
     was ordained 9th June 1835.  The manse is distant a quar-
     ter of a mile from the church (1837.)  It is sin excellent and
     commodious house, and regarded as the best planned and finished
     manse in this district of the country.  The glebe contains twelve
     acres, and is worth about L.20 a-year.  The amount Of the sti-
     pend is 16 chalders (not quite fully realized, the teinds being ex-
     hausted,) two-thirds meal, one-third barley, with L.32, 10s. 7 1/2d.
     in money.
       There are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish.
       The number of families belonging to the Establishment is 128.
     In these there are 569 individuals of all ages.  The number of
     Dissenting or Seceding families is 14; viz. 4 Episcopalian, in which
     there are 10 individuals; 10 Seceding, in which there are 3l in-
     dividuals.
       That the great body of the people is warmly attached to the
     Church of Scotland is clearly proved by the fact, that, when peti-
     tions in favour of Church Establishments were forwarded to Par-
     liament in 1835, every male person above the age of fourteen, with
     the exception of eleven adhibited his signature.  Divine service
     is pnerally well attended ; and the average number of communi-
