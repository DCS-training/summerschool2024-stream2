   Among the popular errors of the day, we may mention the
ready credence given by many persons to the legendary powers of
St Swithen, a watery saiot, who, if it rains upon his day, (the
15th of July,) is said to " keep his word," and squeezes the ele-
ments of their aqueous contents so effectually, that it rains for six
weeks after.  As reasoning will not at all times correct supersti-
tions, which are the worst of popular follies, we may try the weight
of facts, and we shall see that, at least for the first twenty years of
the nineteenth century of the Christian era, St Swithen had either
lost, or voluntarily consented to give up, his power.  Instead of six
weeks or forty-two days after 15th July, I have allowed forty-seven
days, which carries us to the end of August.  For each of the
first twenty years of the century the facts are as follow:-

   It would appear that it rained during the above years on five
different occasions on St Swithen's day; but instead of the 15th
of July being followed on each occasion	with six weeks of rain,
there were only 63 days of rain in thirty weeks.
   It thundered only on 62 out of 7304 days. There was no thunder
in January, February, September, or December.  In the other
months the number of days, with the direction of the winds which
brought the thunder, is as follows:-
