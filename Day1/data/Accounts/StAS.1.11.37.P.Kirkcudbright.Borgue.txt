   Produce.-The principal crops are oats and barley. Twice
as much of both is produced as to serve the inhabitants of
the parish.  The surplus is exported to England and the west
of Scotland.  Wheat, flax and hemp are also reared; but in
small quantities.  The soil is doubtless well adapted for tur-
nips, pease, and other green crops; but they have never been
cultivated to a great extent.  The land is seldom laid out in
sufficient heart. Compost and dunghills, the most valuable of
all manures for a thin and kindly soil, are rarely used.

   Disadvantages.-Three Cricumstances concur to check im-
provement in agriculture:  Short leases of farms, want of
straw yards, and scarcity of labourers.  Where the proprietor
gives only a lease for a few years, scarce any restrictions he
can impose, or any encouragements he will give, are sufficient
to induce the tenant to meliorate his farm. No manure is
found to be of lasting advantage in this country, except dung
which cannot be collected in sufficient quantities, in any other
way but by keeping the cattle in houses, or straw yards; which
no tenant will erect at his own expence, without a very long
lease. Of this proprietors begin to be sensible. Some time ago,
the Earl of Selkirk, and lately Mr. Gairie of Dunroad, have
erected straw yards and farm houses, on a very elegant and
liberal plan.  Others, it may be expected, will soon follow
the example.-Owing to the great increase of manufactures
in the neighbourhood, it is extremely difficult to find a suf-
ficient number of labourers, for carrying on improvements in
agriculture.  The price of labour is nearly doubled within
these last 15 years, and is now perhaps as high as in any
place in Scotland; and as the price of grain is very little raised
in that period, this must also prove a material obstacle to the
improvement of lands.
