   Two other heritors of this district, merely by extending
their tenants leases to twenty four years, without binding
themselves to reimburse to their tenants any expence laid out
on improvements, and without taking their tenants bound to
lay out such expence, have the satisfaction to find a spirit of
enterprise breaking the fetters of inveterate practices, which
have been long ago exploded from other parts of Scotland
and gradually introducing the more pleasant and profitable
ones of inclosing, sowing grass feeds, making hay, feeding
cattle, etc. and even of repairing, at the tenant's expence, the
farm houses, in a manner at once useful and commodious to
the tenant, easy and advantageous to the heritor.  Gilbert
Mason, merchant in Edinburgh, late proprietor of Rothes-
holm, now of Mordum; and Andrew Liddle merchant in,
and one of the baillies of Kirkwall, now deceased, deserve
to be mentioned with honour, as heritors who gave these
leases some years ago to their tenants, and their tenants have
exerted that vigour and industry which long leases encourage*.

farm of South Strynzie, for a period of only fifteen years, was given sometime
ago, by Mr John Scotlay the proprietor, to Edward Chalmers the tenant, who
has erected an earthen fence to inclose eight or nine acres of ground, which
was partly in tillage and partly in natural grass.  He has not only begun
to fow grass feeds, of which his farm stands much in need for pasture, but he
has removed the farm houses to a much more convenient situation than they
occupied when he entered upon the possession An allowance was in-
deed made to him of a certain sum by the proprietor; but this allowance
