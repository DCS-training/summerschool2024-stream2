for which they are paid at an old conversion, which is from
3 4/12 d. to 6 d. for a hen, and so in proportion.  On some e-
states, the tenants are still bound to perform services, such
as ploughing, casting and carrying peats, carriages, &c.; but
as they are rarely, or very few of them, at least, exacted, the
tenants are not desirous to convert them into money; and,
in general, they would give nothing in lieu of them.  On

fused to give the same rent for the possession, which had been
so long paid.  Now, when improvements are commencing,
they might be perhaps more beneficial; but, at present, no
leases longer than 19 years, are granted, and frequently they
do not exceed 11 or 13.

ences in extent of possession, or in rent, make any difference
in the plans or exertions of the farmer; and all possessors of
land, of whatever description, pursue the same methods, and
almost entirely in the same manner.
   As agriculture is, perhaps, in this country, in as low a
state as in any other part of Scotland, that has the advantage
of a good soil, and not an unfavourable climate, it may not
be improper to detail the mode of management practised
here, which, it is believed, has at one time or other prevail-
