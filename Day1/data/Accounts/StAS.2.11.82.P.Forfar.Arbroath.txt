the Restoration, in the year 1660. At the Revolution, in 1688,
the number appears to have been 1400. In 1707, the year of
the Union, it had apparently risen to 2000; and in 1715, the year
of the first Rebellion, to 2300. As the result of actual enumera-
tion, the population is stated to have been 2098 in the year 1755;
3943 in 1776; and 4676 in 1792. The following are the returns
which have been made since the commencement of the present
century.

	In 1801,     2057 Males.    2886 Females.    4943 in all.
	   1811,     2267           3013             5280
           1821,     2694           3315             6009
           1823,     2927           3550             6477

	In the enumerations of 1801 and 1811, resident seamen are not
included. In the three subsequent enumerations they are in-
cluded. The increase which the returns successively exhibit may
be ascribed chiefly to the establishment and extension of the staple
manufacture of the place. Of the population, as above stated,
nearly the whole must be viewed as belonging to that part of the
town of Arbroath which is situated within the parish. Divided
into town and country, the population at the following periods may
be stated thus :--

		In 1792,      -    4545   Town.   131   Country.
                   1801,      -    4763           180
                   1811,      -    5068           212
                   1821,      -    5751           258
                   1823,      -    6217           260
                   1831,      -    6624           319

	The yearly average of births recorded during the last seven
years is 197; to which may be added 20 as the average of those
not recorded, making in all an average of 217 births yearly, or 1
to 32 of the existing population. For the same period the year-
ly average of marriage-contracts, where both parties resided in
the parish, was 39 ; where the man only resided, 13 1/7 ; and where
the woman only was resident, 154. It is only since the beginning
of the year 1828 that a register of burials has been accurately
kept. During a period of four years from that date, there have
been interred in the church-yard of Arbroath, on an average each
year, 140 3/9 persons who died in the parish; 731 who died in the
suburbs of the town, in St Vigeans' parish ; 7 1/2 who died in the
country part of the parish of St Vigeans; and 3 who died else-
where. Probably 10 persons mal die annually in the parish of
