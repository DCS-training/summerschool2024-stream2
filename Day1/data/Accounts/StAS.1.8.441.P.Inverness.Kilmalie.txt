   Proposed Improvements.-In stormy weather, vessels, lying
at Fort William, are obliged to unmoor, and cross to the op-
posite shore:  where, indeed, there is a pretty safe harbour, and
good anchorage, called Camusnugaul.  This is always attend-
ed with additional expence and loss of time, and sometimes
the vessels receive damage upon the banks.  All this could
be avoided, if only 400 L. were laid out in building a proper
quay.  But, small this sum is, the merchants of Fort Wil-
liam are unable to advance it.  The Duke of Gordon, who
is proprietor of the place, is. the only person from whom
assistance can be expected.  But the necessity, or utility of
such a work, has never been represented to him.  There is a
still greater necessity of establishing at Fort William, a weekly
market for butcher meat and other articles.  For want of
this, people seldom have it in their power to purchase fresh
meat; and all winter and spring they feed upon salt provisions.
This could be easily remedied, and some of the neighbouring
sheep farmers would find it their interest, were they to sell
some of their flock to a butcher in the place.
   Abundance of good water could easily, and at a small ex-
pence, be conducted by pipes.  This ought to be done by
Government, because the garrison is much worse supplied
than the village.-The only objection against a tannery, is,
that there are too few cattle killed in the country, for keeping
such a work going.  But, then, would it not be an easy mat-
ter to import undressed hides, and to tan them here?  This
is done in other places.-Against the erection of a saw mill,
there can be no solid objection.  There was one formerly on
the river Archaig; but it did not answer the purpose, on ac-
count of its distance from the garrison; and was therefore
