Lock is 156 feet; and the descent to the Clyde 150 feet, so that
the Forth at the east end of the canal is 6 feet lower than the
Clyde at Bowling. This great canal, which required 22 years for its
completion, was one of the most arduous to execute in the kingdom;
having to encounter rocks, precipices, and quicksands; in some
places it runs through a deep moss, and in others it is banked 20
feet high. It crosses many rivulets and roads, as well as 2 consi-
derable rivers, the Luggie an d the Kelvin. The bridge over the
latter, which consists of four arches, and carries the canal across a
deep valley, cost L. 8509. The canal is supplied with water by
eight reservoirs covering 721 acres, and containing 24,902 lock-
fulls of water.
	Mr Kirkman Finlay of Castle Toward, the present governor,
was elected to that important office on 20th March 1816. At the
following balance the rate per cent. on each original share of
L. 100 was L. 25. The annual average revenue during sixteen
years previous to Mr Finlay being appointed governor, was L. 30,323,
7s. 6d.; and the annual average revenue during sixteen years after
it was L. 46,680, 11s. 4d.
	In 1832, there were 2 steam passage-boats on the canal; each
of 24 horse power. These boats went at the rate of six miles an
hour. In 1833, the steam-boats gave place to swift iron boats,
which travel at the rate of 10 miles an hour. Five of these boats
leave Port Dundas for Stirling and Edinburgh, and return every
lawful day, and two additional ones are in a state of preparation.
In 1832, the revenue from steam and heavy drag boats was
L. 1213, 19s. 5d.; in 1833 from the swift boats L. 3OO7, 19s 1d.;
and in 1834, upwards of L. 5000.
	Monkland CanaL--This canal affords a cheap communication
between the city of Glasgow, and the collieries in the parishes of
Old and New Monkland, distant about 12 miles. The canal was
originally 35 feet broad at the top, and 24 at the bottom, depth of
water upon the lock sills 5 feet, and the smallest depth throughout
any part of the canal 4 feet 6 inches. The banks have been re-
cently raised, by which a greater depth of water is procured. At
Blackhill there are 4 locks of 2 chamber, each chamber 71 feet
long, 14 feet broad, and 12 feet deep. The head level at the top
of Blackhill is continued to Sheepford, a distance of 8 miles, where
there are 2 single locks of 11 feet 6 inches each, which carries the
canal to the river Calder. In the spring of 1813, 3 passage-boats
began to play to Sheepford, about a mile from Airdrie. This canal
