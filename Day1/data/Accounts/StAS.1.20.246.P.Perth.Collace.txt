     Statistical Account

the remains of encampments, the ruins of castles, the vesti-
ges of tombs, the appearance of mote-hills, or feats of ju-
stice, and the names of places, all affording concurring evi-
dence of their authenticity.

   The circumstances regarding the battle of Luncarty, in
particular, were uncommonly minute and circumstantial.
The encampments of the Scottish and Danish armies*, the
place where Hay and his gallant sons resided, called Gul-
lan, a farm opposite to Luncarty, the field they were
ploughing at the time, the ford where they crossed the
Tay, and the very spot where they stopped and animated
their flying countrymen, &c. &c. were all pointed out, by
old men in the neighbourhood, when examined by the Au-
thor, in 1772.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The place where the Danish army had encamped, was, anno 1772,
called Denmark.
