     Statistical Account

From their verdant sides, many beautiful rivulets of the fin-
est water are daily gliding down, for the health and refresh-
ment of the inhabitants who dwell below.

   Roads.-There are two high-ways passing through this
parish, leading from Stirling to Kinross. The one is upon
the south side of the Dovan; and the other upon the north
side.  That upon the south side of the Dovan is only in part
formed, but not gravelled; and as it passes through clay
grounds, it is scarcely passable in winter.  But that upon the
north side of the Dovan, as it passes along the foot of the O-
chil hills, where the bottom is a hard channel, is equally firm
and passable at all seasons; and therefore is most frequented.
The proper stage upon that road, between Stirling and Kin-
ross, is Dollar.  The greatest fault of it is, that it is too nar-
row; for, in some places, two carriages meeting can do no
more than pass. Were it only widened a little, nature has suf-
ficiently gravelled it.  They who have marked it out at first,
humouring the nature of the ground along the foot of the
hills, have formed it much after the manner of a serpen-
tine walk.  It is very much frequented, not only by those
who travel from Stirling to Kinross, but also by those who
go to Perth, Dundee, etc.

   Population.-The population of this parish has decreased
very little within these 40 years.
