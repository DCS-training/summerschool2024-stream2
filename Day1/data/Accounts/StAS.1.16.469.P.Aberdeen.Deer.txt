     NUMBER XXII.

     PARISH OF DEER,

     (COUNTY, SYNOD, AND PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By Mr GEORGE CRUDEN, Schoolmaster of Deer.

     Name, etc.

   IN the records of the presbytery, the name of this parish
is variously spelled Deare, Diere, Diet, and Deer.  The
last now prevails; and the word is said to be of Gaelic ori-
gin.  De a'r', contracted for De adhra, signifies, The wor-
ship of God, and may have been applied to this place, be-
cause here probably the first church in this corner was
erected. Deer is the mother-church of the presbytery.
   The parish of Fetter-Angus, which is a detached portion
of the county of Banff, and lies along the north-east side of
Deer, was annexed to this parish in the year 1618.  Before
that period, the cure of the former was served by the mi-
nister of St Fergus.  The foundation of the church, which,
like the parish, has been small, is to be seen, and the church.
yard is still used for burial-ground.
