natives of the parish.  They are all of the Established Church,
except 5 Burgher Seceders, 15 Episcopalians, (formerly Non-
jurors), and 1 Catholic, a very late convert from the Esta-
blished religion.  The Episcopalians appear sometimes in the
parish church: the Seceders and the Catholics are never seen

   The inhabitants of this parish seem, in general, to be as well
pleased with their lot as any in similar stations in this part of
Scotland.  I know of no oppression that they labour under;
and I have always observed, that it is with reluctance, that
any person or family, who have been for some time in the pa-

not likely that any considerable improvement will take place
in the county.  The establishment of great manufacturing
houses at Aberdeen, operates, as yet, against the landed inte-
rest.  While it is every year raising the price of labour, it has
in no degree raised the price of grain, and has had very little
effect on that of cattle.  It has produced a most distressing
scarcity of farm-servants, which, in a country so little improv-
ed, must be ruinous in a very high degree.

20 and 30.  The whole yearly sum which the kirk-session
have under their management, for the benefit of the poor, is
about 18 L., which arises from the weekly collections in the
church, and the interest of some legacies.  There is also the
