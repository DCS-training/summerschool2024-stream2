     Statistical Account

that, during a considerable part of the last century, Kirkaldy
was in a very flourishing state.

   Early Population.-1. The population of the parish was
equal, or most probably superior, to what it is at present.
During a period of 14 years, commencing with 1616, the
yearly average of registered births was 121; which would
make the population, computing it as 26 to 1 of the births,
to have been 3146.  For some time after, the numbers
appear to have increased rapidly.  In 1643 the accommoda-
tion of the parish required a new wing to be added to the
church; and in 165O it was found necessary to make a new
erection*.  The annual average of births, for 10 years im-
mediately preceding the date of that erection, was 174 3/10,
which made the whole population about 4540; and for the
same space of time immediately following it, 115; which made
the population 2990.  From this statement it appears, that,
supposing the whole inhabitants to be as 26 to 1 of the births,
the parish of Kirkaldy was more populous, for some time after
its first reduction to its present limits, than it is at this day.
And were the estimate to be made by the proportion which
the present number of inhabitants actually bears to
the annual births, the difference in the population of
that time would appear to have been very consider-
able+.

+The above rule for computing the population of a parish or district from
the births, is suggested in "Queries for the purpose of elucidating the Natu-
"ral History and Political State of Scotland, circulated by Sir John Sinclair."
In this parish, however, the computation falls short of the real proportion.
The number of registered births in 179 was 60; and on an average of the
20 preceding years, 50.  But, as the registration of births has for some time
