burghs would exert themselves to advance, not only the

and of all domestic duty and comfort; the reproach of man, 
and the disgrace of woman.

period, the harbour continued very imperfect, capable of 
containing only a few small vessels.  Early in the present 
century, it was enlarged and deepened, by digging into the 
solid rock, 8 feet deep at an average; and at the same
time very commodious quays were built.  This was a 
work of incredible labour and expence, and reflects no 
small honour on those who has the management of public 
affairs at that time.  In reality it was the most capital im-
provement of the place, and the very making of the town 
and its trade.  The harbour, though very safe, is still but
small, and of difficult access.  There was lately a new
