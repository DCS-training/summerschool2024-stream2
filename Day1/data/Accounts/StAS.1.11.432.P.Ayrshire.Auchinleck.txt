   Markets, Roads, Village, etc.-On the last Tuesday of Au-
gust there is a well frequented fair for the sale of lambs+.
About 1770, the roads were almost impassable in winter; but
now three turnpike roads pass through the parish.  The vil-
lage of Auchinleck has for these two or three years past been
on the decline, and several houses are now empty, owing, in
some measure, to the Muirkirk Iron and Coal Tar Works,
but more especially to the Cotton mill at Catrine, which have
attracted inhabitants from this parish.

*As the Seceders do not register the births of their children, these are not
included in the above statement.
