  The haugh grounds in the valley of Borthwick are especially
apt to suffer during such occasional inadditions-in particular, the
small farm connected with the castle, and which lies along the low
grounds by the side of the stream, often sustains serious damage.
Its crops are laid down-the soil is carried away-a layer of sand
is spread over a great part of the surface and sometimes the corn
stacks have been seen steeped in water almost to their sloping roofs.
Such rapid descents of water are especially frequent during the
autumnal and winter months.
  In the month of August 1837, the quantity-of water which usual-
ly comes down during such great falls of rain was prodigiously aug-
mented by another cause. A pond on the estate of Middleton
gave way-the river itself had been raised to great power and size
by the water which had previously fallen from the atmosphere-
and the united mass of the pond and the augmented stream toge-
ther descended with a force which threatened very serious effects
throughout the whole of its course. During its progress through the
deep ravine of Currie wood, it must have presented an impressive
spectacle, if day-light had permitted the neighbours to witness its
course-for the wooded banks of the ravine are in close proximity
to each other,-and when the mighty flood had passed, and opportu-
nity was afforded of tracing its effects, what struck all observers was,
that it seemed to have played with masses of stone many tons in weight,
as if they bad been pebbles of ordinary size-the solid rock was
in several places torn from its foundations,-deep pools were form-
ed, where previously the tiniest foot of "wood-nymph or lady fair"
might have stepped without hazard of being wetted,-and at one
placed about w space of three or four hundred yards, not one
particle of soil or of loose rock was left upon the surface-but
Whatever had been gathering since the chaotic waters first retired,
or what they perhaps had deposited, was swept off-and only the
bare surface of the subjacent rock was exposed to the eye of the
observer. This descent of the waters occurred during the darkness
of a peculiarly cloudy and tempestuous night, and it was not a little
curious and impressive to witness the lights of the anxious cottag-
ers by the water side, as they watched on the opposite banks the
descent of the mighty and resistless mass-saw their bridge borne
away by the tumultuous torrent-and shouted to each other to give
information of what was occurring that seemed most worthy of
notice.
