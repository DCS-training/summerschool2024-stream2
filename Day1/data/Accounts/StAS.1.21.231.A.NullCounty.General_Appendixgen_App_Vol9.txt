habitants, with the average addition of about 2 firlots of fo-
reign victual to each individual.  No person in the country
died for want of bread.  Those who had, supplied those who
wanted.  And whatever, Lady Sutherland might have lost in
interest, she gained as much at least by the inward satisfac-
tion of having relieved the distressed.
   There was great loss of cattle in spring 1782 by the severi-
ty of the season, but there were very few disabled from keep-
ing their farms; and though several were brought to the
verge of bankruptcy, yet, by lenity and indulgence on the
part of the proprietors, they in a few years recovered their
circumstances.

   April 22, 1793.-At this period, a regiment of Fencible
men is newly raised in this country.  In consequence of Earl
Gower's having undertaken to raise a fencible regiment in
this country, Colonel Wemyss of Wemyss the Colonel-Com-
mandant, and the Honourable Colonel Stewart the Lieutenant-
Colonel of the regiment, began to recruit on the 23d of March,
and in the course of 8 days recruiting they completed their
number with a considerable overplus.
   Wherever they displayed their colours, the people slocked
to them in multitudes from every corner, testifying their loy-
alty to their king, their zeal for the constitution, and their
attachment to their superiors Lord Gower and Lady Suther-
land.  Colonel Wemyss commanded the fencible regiment of
this country in the years 1779, 1780, 1781 and 1782, and
the people's attachment to the Colonel had its share too, in
their alacrity to engage in the service.
   In the course of the few days recruiting, many more good
men might have been had; but as the commission was too li-
mited for this country, only the pick of the men were taken,
to the mortification of many that are left.
