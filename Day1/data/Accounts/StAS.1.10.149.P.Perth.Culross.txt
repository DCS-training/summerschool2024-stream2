   A proper regard to religion, and respect for its institutions,
almost universally prevail.  There is no place of worship but
that of the established Church.  The number of sectaries,
chiefly Burgher and Antiburgher Seceders, does not exceed
50, and these show no symptoms of sourness or bigotry, but,
on the contrary, are exceedingly mild, civil, and obliging in
their manner, living in perfect good neighbourhood with all
around them, and are by no means the least industrious in
the parish.  The fashionable modes of free thinking are
hardly known, and avowed by none, except by such, and
these extremely few, as, from conscious vice and folly, ac-
count it their interest not to think at all.

   P. S.  By the late rapid extension and success of manufac-
tures in the country, the spirit of industry, which seemed for
a while to lie dormant, now begins to awaken; so that, from
June 1791, when a particular investigation was gone into,
with a view to this report, a considerable addition has been
made to the number of looms in the parish; and two new
branches of manufacture have been established in the town,
viz. those of tambouring and flowering muffins.  In the first,
38 young girls are already engaged, from 9 years old and up-
wards; and in the other 34.  Those below 12 years old are
bound for 3 years, and have, for the first year, 1 s. 6 d. per
week allowed them; for the second year, 2 s.; and for the
last, 3 s.  Those above 12, and below 16, have 2 s. per week
the first year, 2 s. 6 d. the second, and 3 s. the last; and
such as are older, and bound for only two years, have 2 s.
the first year, and 2 s. 6 d. the last.  So that now, in propor-
tion to the numbers in a family, provided they are soberly
and industriously brought up, their affluence and comfort in-
crease; and, indeed, a spirit of contentment and chearfulness
is universally diffused among the people, and hardly a mur-
mur to be heard.
