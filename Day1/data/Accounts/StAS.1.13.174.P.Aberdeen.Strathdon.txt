ney, but others still exact them in kind: and even where 
they are converted, the rents are thereby so much raised, 
that the cure is almost as bad as the disease.  Of course, 
the mode of farming has undergone little variation here, 
except among the gentlement; excepting on some farms, 
where there is outfield, the tenants generally go over all 
their arable land with dung once in three years.  In many 
places, especially in the upper parts of the parish, dung is 
laid on the surrow for bear, and harrowed in with the 
seed.  In other parts, it is laid on the white land, either in 
autumn, or early in the spring, and covered with a break- 
furrow; and after lying some time in this state, is clean 
ploughed for the seed:  This is followed by two succeeding 
crops of oats; after which, the ground is dunged again, 
and the same rotation of crops observed as before; and 
thus, the greatest part of the arable land here has been 
treated, time immemorial, without rest, or any other 
cleaning, than throwing off some of the weeds raised by 
the harrow in a dry season.  Very good crops, however, 
both of bear and oats, are raised in this way. 
   Few of the estates or farms here have been measured,ex-
cepting on some of the largest farms where there is outfield 
ground.  The tenants is general pay nearly at the rate of L. 1 
Sterling for every boll's sowing of arable land they pos- 
ses; and as the soil is generally thin, and not in great or- 
der, it is believed that a Scotch acre will require almost a 
boll of oats for seed.  Along with this, however, every 
tenant has some meadow-ground for grass, and a right of 
pasturage in the adjacent hills or glens.  Though the land 
in general is little improved, the rents have been doubled, 
and in some places tripled within these 40 years past.  This 
circumstance, together with the great advance in the wa- 
ges of servants, makes the situation of our farmers rather
