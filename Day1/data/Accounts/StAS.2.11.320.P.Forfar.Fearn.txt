school stand nearly in the centre of the population, and are of easy
access to almost every family. Together with all the other public
buildings, they are comparatively of recent erection, and, with the
exception of the church, in very tolerable repair. The minister's
stipend may be stated in round numbers at 85 bolls of victual,
and L. 85 Sterling, and the extent of the grebe at 10 acres. The
schoolmaster's salary is modified at L.28, with the legal house and
garden. An old provision of 8 bolls of oatmeal is suspected to be
irrecoverably lost. A mortification of 2 1/2 bolls continues to be
paid, and is very available in cases of partial necessity. As the
means of public instruction may be considdrdd to be fully ade-
quate, it is thought sufficient to state generally, that the young,
without exception, have the benefit of a good school education;
and that the number of communicants for upwards of thirty years
past has averaged 180.
