   It is cause of regret, that the war has proved so disastrous,
and that many of our disasters are to be ascribed to the
baseness of traitors among ourselves, who give to the ene-
my all the intelligence and aid in their power.  We may
be persuaded, that several of our ships, in the list of cap-
tures, have been freighted with warlike stores and provi-
sions for the enemy's use, and have purposely thrown
themselves in the way of French cruicers.  It is hard to
say what success they may have in alluring our sailors into
their service; but we know, that by want, bad bread, and
bad treatment, they have brought many of them to their
grave.  It is treason to take part with the enemies of the
King and the nation, or to aid them in the manner now
mentioned.  To pray for success to them, or to pray against
the success of our own troops, if it be not a degree of trea-
son, does certainly come very near to it.  It shews that
there is abundance of treason in the heart, and in the in-
tention.  People do hereby show the strongest inclination
to side with the enemy, and that nothing but want of
power and opportunity prevents them from doing it.  One
is surprised to find an orator pleading publicly before a most
venerable Court, in behalf of such petitioners; and gloss-
ing their prayers as mere wishes that a junto would not
prevail against France.  Of that junto Britain is a part.
In the last session of parliament some speakers represented
it as the principal.  It is now like to stand single in the
contest; and therefore to pray for success to the French,
or to pray that Britons may not prevail, is nothing less
than praying, that the British throne be pulled down, and
the British constitution levelled in the dust; that Britain
may become a section of the French republic, one and un-
divided, and thus be enslaved to the most arbitrary and exe-
crable tyranny that ever existed.
