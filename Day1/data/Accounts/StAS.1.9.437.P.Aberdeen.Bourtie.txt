medden.  The principal fuel is peat, and some turf from
the moors and surface of the peat-moss.

   Antiquities.-On the summit of the hill of Barra,
there are the distinct remains of a camp, of a circular
form, in extent near to 3 acres, and surrounded with 3
ditches.  It goes under the name of the Cummin's Camp.
The Cummins were a bold and numerous race of people,
who are said to have been proprietors of the greatest part
of the Buchan country, and disaffected to King Robert
Bruce.  After the battle near Inverury, where the king's
arms were victorious, he marched his troops, stormed this
camp, and put the Cummins to flight.  It is probable
this camp had been originally formed by the Danes, as it
seems to have required considerable time and labour to
execute it, and that the Cummins had taken possession of
it as an advantageous post.  In the church yard these is a
long rough stone, cut out into a coarse statue of a man.
The traditional report is, that it was done for the cele-
brated Thomas de Longueville, the companion of Wallace,
who was killed in storming the above mentioned camp,
and is buried here; but all this rests upon uncertain tradi-
tion.  There are three Druidical temples here, two of
them pretty entire.

   Heritors and Stipend.-There are 5 heritors, none of
whom at present reside.  The stipend is L 42: 4: 5 in
money, 32 bolls of meal, and 16 bolls of bear.

   Character of the People.-They are sober, industrious,
and peaceable.  Since 1744 none of them have been tried
before a criminal court.
