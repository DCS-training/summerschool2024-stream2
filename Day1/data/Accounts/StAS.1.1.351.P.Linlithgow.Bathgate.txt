     of Bathgate.

4 s. to 4 s. 6 d. a stone; and butter from 8 d. to 10 d. a
pound:  These latter articles, such as hens, etc.  are nearly
double; and beef and mutton at least a third dearer than they
were 30 or 40 years ago.  Excepting mutton and lamb, the
parish is abundantly able to supply itself with provisions; and
there is usually a considerable quantity of beef, barley, butter,
and cheese, sent out of it.  At Bathgate, there is a regular
flesh market twice a week.

   Prices of Labour.-Day labourers wages are 1 s. a day;
masons, carpenters, and bricklayers from 1 s. 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d.;
taylors, when they work out of their own houses, 8 d. and
victuals.  A man who can hold the plough well, and mow,
etc. will receive L. 8, or perhaps L. 9; and the ordinary
wages of men servants for threshing, carting, etc. is about
L. 7 a year.  They usually have their victuals in the house,
or, instead of them, two pecks of oat-meal, and 6 d.
for kitchen* weekly.  The female servants for husbandry
have generally L. 3 for their yearly wages; and it is the
common practice, with very few exceptions, to hire servants
by the half year.  The domestic and farm servants in gentle-
mens families have, perhaps, from L. 1 to L. 2 a year more
than those employed by farmers.  The farmers, in general,
keep no domestic servants, except, perhaps, sometimes one
woman in harvest, employing their children in the business
of the farm, both within and without doors.

   Implements of Husbandry.-The plough universally used,
till within the last two or three years, was the old Scottish
plough, drawn by 4, 6, and sometimes 8 cattle; 2 of which,
when there were 6, and often 4, when there were 8, were
