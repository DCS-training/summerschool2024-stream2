   Black Cattle.-Of these a considerable number is an-
nually reared.  Till of late years, they were employed
in drawing the plough, but they are now seldom or never
used.  Instead of two horses and two oxen in the plough,
which required a man servant and a boy to drive them, two
horses only are used, and one man manages both them and
the plough at the same time.  This is a considerable saving
to the farmer, now when the wages are so high; and as the
horses plough moves quicker, more ground is ploughed in
the same time.  It is the new plough that is used in this
part of the country.

   Sheep.-Several flocks of these were formerly in the pa-
rish; now there is but one.  The tenants found the sheep
very hurtful to their sown grass, which, in the winter, they
tore up by the roots.  Their Sheep Walks are now, by
means of lime, turned into good corn fields, which they find
to be more profitable.  They may, however, at length be
compelled to return to their former practice of feeding
flocks of sheep, to meliorate those fields which are at too
great a distance for driving dung to them; when the strength
of the lime is spent, and they become unfit for producing
crops of corn, the tedding of the sheep may be found neces-
sary to recruit these fields.

   Minerals.-There is abundance of rock, some of a more
hard, some of a softer nature.  The first is very proper for
common buildings, the latter for the making of roads; to
improve which there is such an uncommon spirit now hap-
pily prevailing in this part of the nation.  There is also
much channel, well adapted to the same purpose.  But there
is no free stone; this is brought from the other side of the
Tay in boats, from a noted quarry in Angus-shire, com-
monly known by the name of Millfield Quarry.
