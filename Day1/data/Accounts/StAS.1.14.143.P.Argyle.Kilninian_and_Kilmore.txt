dwelling houses, for which there is a growing taste.

   Lakes, Rivers, Coasts.-There are 5 lakes in the pa-
rish, all of them abounding with excellent trout.  Our
rivers are not considerable for the body of water; yet,
at the mouth of 2 or 3 of them, a few fine salmon are
found in the summer season.  The shores are, for the
most part, high and rocky; yet not without many open-
ings and flats, in some of which are found banks of shell,
crumbled into sand, which is much used for manure.  In
this, as in most Highland countries, the custom is, to con-
fine cattle in folds during the summer and autumn nights;
and the spots thus manured, are called Tathfields.  When
a tathfield is thinly strewed with this sand, in the month
of July or August, it produces 4 or 5 crops of such oats
as are raised here, and would give more, if followed fur-
ther; but if a greater number of crops is taken, or if
the sand has been laid on without a mixture of other ma-
nure, it soon impoverishes the soil.  The small tenantry
have sometimes, through ignorance or avarice, so run out

in ground where they were never known before.  On
the coasts of this parish, some ling, cod, skate, mackerel,
flounder, lythe, seath, perch, dog-fish, etc. are found,
but not in any great quantities.  The berring sometimes
