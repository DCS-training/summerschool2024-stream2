   Roads.-It must appear very strange to any person ac-
quainted with the improvements, which other parts of
Scotland have received by means of roads, when it is men-
tioned, that, in this very extensive country, not a yard of
road had ever been attempted to be formed, till within
these few years.  The statute labour has long been com-
muted.  For about 16 miles along the Liddal, the road
lay rather in the river than upon its banks, the only path
being in what is called the Watergate, and the unhappy
traveller must cross it at least 24 times in that extent.  The
same thing still takes place, with respect to the Hermitage,
as far as it runs.  At length, by the exertions of two of
the heritors, fortunately for the country. possessed of public
spirit, Mr Oliver of Dinlabyre, and Mr Elliot of Whit-
haugh, a road was begun, and is now carrying along the
side of the Liddal for several miles.  Hawick being aim
the only market from which we receive meal, groceries,
spirits, iron, etc etc. the want of a road to it is attended
with much inconvenience and expence.  But the funds,
arising from the statute labour, are perhaps inadequate to
keep so many miles of road in such repair as the country
requires, and much less to make new ones.  Unless some
other method is adopted, the present road cannot be com-
pleted, and there is no reason to hope, that the road along
the Hermitage can be formed in the present generation.
There is much intercourse with both Hawick and Lang-
holm, by weekly markets, fairs, etc. and the difficulty of
travelling to those places is inconceivable.  Every article
must be carried on horseback; and through these deep and
broken bogs and mosses we must crawl to the great fatigue
of ourselves, but the much greater injury of our horses,
