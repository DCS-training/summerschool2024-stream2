   The change in regard to marriages is equally great. Formerly,
from 80 to 100 persons used to assemble, and to pass at least two
days in feasting and dancing.  Now the average number does not
exceed five or six; the bridal feast is often nothing more than the
usual poor fare of potatoes and herrings, with the addition of a
glass of whisky to each individual present, and music and dancing
are generally discontinued.  Balls and dancing parties have also
been given up throughout the parish.  Indeed, all public gather-
ings, whether for sbinty playing, or tbrowing the putting-stone,
for drinking and dancing, for marriages or funerals, have been
discontinued, and people live very much apart.  There is not a
tenth part of the whisky consumed that was consumed in the olden
time; nor is there one fight for ten that were then fought.  Disputes
are now referred to the arbitration of the Sheriff, instead of being
settled by club-law.
   In regard to the general morals of the parish,--a change which,
upon the whole, may be pronounced decidedly favourable, has
taken place.  An open and unshrinking profession of religion, of
the faith of Christ, is more frequent and more honoured than it
was not man years ago; and while there are some guilty of more
glaring immorality than was then known, yet there are others
leading lives of stricter purity and godliness.  Thus the two ex-
tremes are separating more widely, and it is cause of rejoicing to
think, that, though the wicked are becoming more bold in their
wickedness, believers are at the same time becoming more cou-
rageous in the cause of the Lord, and that, being, engaged in his
cause, they will assuredly prevail.
