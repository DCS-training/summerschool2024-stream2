   Surface and Cultivation.-The lower part of the parish
has the appearance of being flat; but in many places it is
very unequal.  About 26 years ago, it was almost in a state
of nature, with scarcely an enclosure in it: Now, the greatest
part is cultivated to a high degree, and about two thirds of
it substantially enclosed, either with stone dikes, ditch and
hedge, or ditch and paling; which fences, with the stripes
and clumps of planting, well dressed fields, and handsome
farm steadings, make a most beautiful appearance.

                                                Acres.
Of arable land it is supposed there are about    4300
Of mossy, swampy, and waste ground, about         700
And in planting, about                            900

                               In all,           5900

   Produce and Cattle, etc.-The common returns from the
arable ground, in oats and bear, are from 4 to 6 bolls per
acre; and of wheat from 8 to 10.  There is but little hay
made, the farmer finding his account rather in fattening cattle.*
Of these there may be reared in a season about 500, and fat-
tened on turnips from 180 to 200.  There are about 400 more
cattle in the parish.  The mode of culture is much the same
with what has been described in other improved parishes.
Farmers, who pay from 150 L. to 300 L. of rent, possess about
one half.  There is one farmer indeed who pays more; but
he, with other two, does not reside.  There is one threshing
machine in the parish.  There is only one flock of sheep.  The
ewes were brought from Northumberland about a year and
a half ago, and thrive remarkably well.  Their fleeces bring
about 4 s. each; and, when fat, they weigh about 22 lb. per
