cieling, present a very sorry appearance for a place of wor-
ship.
   The stipend hitherto has been 85 bolls of oat-meal, and
L. 27:7:11 Sterling in money.  A new decreet of modifica-

before the Teind Court, in 1793, converting the money into
grain; which when allocated, will augment the value of
the living to L. 130.  His Grace the Duke of Montrose is
patron.

   Roads, etc.-This parish is intersected with good roads in
every direction.  Two turnpikes run through it from south
to north, in parallel lines, at 2 miles distance from each
other.  The one leads from Glasgow to Balfron, and a little
beyond that village, joins the great military road between
Stirling and Dumbarton, at the 17 th mile stone from Stirling.
The other line leads from Glasgow to Drymen, where it also
joins the military road, at the 11 th mile from Dumbarton.
Besides these roads, which intersect the parish at right angles,
there is another which cuts it diagonally, from southeast to
northwest, forming a junction between the Edinburgh road
near Kilsyth, and the above-mentioned military road at Dry-
men bridge.  The western part of this line, which was for-
merly impassible, is just now converted into an excellent
turnpike road.  If the bridge over tile Leven at the mouth of
Lochmond, which is at present in contemplation, be built,
the straight road from the west highlands to Edinburgh, will
run through Strathblane, thereby avoiding the compass by
Stirling on the one hand, and by Glasgow on the other.
To these advantages, it will add that of being more level,
there being no sensible ascent from the Leven, to Kilsyth.
All these roads have receipted very material improvements
within the last 6 years.  From being so steep and rugged,
