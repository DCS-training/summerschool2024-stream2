     CHAP. IV. POPULATION.

     SECT. I.  Former State of Population.-There is an account
of this parish, in Macfarlane's manuscript Geographica Col-
lections, preserved in the Advocates Library, in which the
number of examinable persons, in the town of Thurfo, is sta-
ted at about 900; and in the whole parish at 2200.  The
return to Dr Webster, in 1755, ws 2963 souls.  As the
inhabitants now amount to 3146 persons, there is conse-

of the population of this district, will appear from the an-

population of the town, has not only increased of late, but is
likely to be rapidly augmented.  This can hardly fail to
be the case, in a place so happily situated, and where encou-
ragement is given to the extension of its commerce and man-

   SECT. III.  Diseases.-This district is not afflicted with
any peculiar distempers, by which its population can be af-
fected.  The principal, undoubtedly, is the small-pox, which,
chiefly affecting those, who are in an early stage of life, de-
stroys the very source whence additional numbers may be
expected.  The following observations upon that subject,
and on other diseases to which they are liable in this neigh-
bourhood, drawn up by Mr John Williamson, surgeon to
