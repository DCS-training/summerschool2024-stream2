designed for a more enlightened worship, in order to induce the
Pagan inhabitants to attend the institutions of revealed religion,
were naturally led to make choice of a situation, the more re-
vered by them, as being the place where they had formerly
been accustomed to perform their rites of devotion*.  Inish-
ail, or Beautiful Isle, is so named, from that green and pictu-
resque island in Lochow, once the site of a small nunnery of
the Cistertian order; and where, in a ruinous chapel of that
religious house, public worship was alternately performed, till
the year 1736.  A church, more commodious for the parish,
was then built on the south side of the lake, opposite to Inis-
hail.

   Extent and Situation.-The length of the united parishes,
from E. to W. is above 24 measured miles.  The breadth is va-
rious and unequal.  They are situated on the borders of the county
of Perth, near the village of Clifton, and inn of Tayndrom,
one of the highest inhabited situations in North Britain.  Here,
a small rivulet marks the division of the counties of Argyll
and Perth; part of which runs eastward into Loch Tay, and
falls into the German sea; and part runs westward into Loch-
ow, and discharges itself, at Bunaw, into an Arm of the At-
lantic ocean.  The church of Glenorchay is 15 miles N. E.
from Inveraray, the chief town of the shire, and the feat of the
courts of justice; and is nearly at an equal distance S. E. from
Bunaw*.

*At this place there is a considerable salmon fishing and iron foundery; and
a quay is built on a secure and well sheltered bay for vessels of small burden,
which ply occasionally, to Liverpool, Whitehaven, Ulverston, and other places,
loaded with pig-iron, tanner's bark, kelp and salmon; and import in return, iron
ore, meal, coals, tanned leather, stone-ware, and other articles of commerce.
