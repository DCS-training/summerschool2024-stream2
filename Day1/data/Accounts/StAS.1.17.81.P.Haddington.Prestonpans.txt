     of Preston-pans

Clerk for the 3 last years of Queen Anne.  He resigned his
seat on the bench in the year 1734, that he might go into
Parliament to oppose SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.  He was
proprietor of the lands now belonging to Schaw's Hospital
and Watson's Hospital.  HEW DALRYMPLE, LORD DRUM-

GRANT of Prestongrange was Lord Advocate in 1746, and
carried on the prosecutions, against the unfortunate persons
who had been engaged in the rebellion, with such fidelity to
the Crown, and, at the same time, with so much feeling and
lenity for the accused, as gained him universal approbation.
He was afterwards appointed one of the Senators of the Col-
lege of Justice, and one of the Lords Commissioners of Jus-
ticiary.  Some gentlemen, of the first merit in their several
lines of life, were educated at the school here, viz. the late
Colonel CAMPBELL DALRYMPLE, youngest son of Lord
Drummore, who was Governour of Guadaloupe after it was
taken in the war of 1756; SIR ROBERT MURRAY KEITH,
and his brother SIR BASIL KEITH; the lost of whom, after
an honourable life in the navy, died Governour of Jamaica.
The first still survives, an honour to the corps diplomatique,
as a member of which he has done eminent services to his
King and country.

appear to be any free stone quarries worth the working.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Among the advantages are
be reckoned the fishery, and vicinity of coal.  Among the
