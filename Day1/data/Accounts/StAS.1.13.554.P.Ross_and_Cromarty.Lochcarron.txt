proportion as they fed, soberly or voraciously on the her-
ring, the fever was more or less severe.  Such as lived 
mostly on fish, and other strong food, suffered dreadful a-

gruel, suffered very little.  There are many instances of
longevity in the parish.  There have been likewise instan-

sweet passion of love, after passing their grand climacterick.

   Gaelic Poets.-Locharron has produced some good High-
land poets.  William Mackenzie, and Alexander, his bro-
ther, composed good Gaelic songs.  Some of thier poems
are to be found in Macdonald's collection.  John, their bro-
ther, was equally good; and from the specimens we have
of thier poetry, we may say, it is cause of regret, that
more of thier verses were not committed to writing, both
on account of the language and sentiments.  The thoughts
are just and natural; and the language, for the most part,
beyond the reach of criticism.  There have been likewise
other poets in Lochearron, who have composed verses,
that are far from being despicable.  And indeed many of
them would have given the highest pleasure to the greatest
admirers of Homer, Virgil, or Milton, had they heard and
underflood them.  Gaelic is the language of descriptive
poetry.  It is strong, nervous and comprehensive.  No
language can do greater justice to the finest feelings of the
human heart.
