   Parochial Registers.-The oldest parochial register commences
1702, and ends 1738.  It is simply a register of births and bap-
tisms, containing no details.  The second, commencing 1743, is
much fuller, and contains, along with such register, a record of
the session's discipline and diligence down to 1790.  From that
time to 1821 the record had again passed into a simple register,
with session's collections and disbursements for the poor, and the
names merely of those subjecting themselves to discipline, set over
against the money-penalties which had been exacted from them.
With the exception of deaths and burials, of which there has been
no register kept, the record has lately been much more full, and
contains now a general entry of all that is ordinarily transacted in
the session.
   There are four silver communion-cups, two of them gifted by
George Chalmer, a minister of the parish in the times of Episco-
pacy; the other two by Mr Abel, also minister, who died in 1794.
There is also a hand-bell of considerable antiquity, with the name
George Biset upon it, 1504.
   There have been in all eight ministers of this parish, from the
period of the Revolution, or rather from the death of the last
Episcopalian incumbent, to the present time.  The first Presby-
terian, Mr John Turing, ordained and admitted 16th March
1703, died 1st February 1733; Mr John Stuart, translated from
Longbride, and admitted at Drumblade 1st February 1734, died
January 1743; Mr George Gordon, translated from Bourtie, and
admitted at Drumblade, 19th October 1743, died 8th December
1763; Mr William Bisset, translated from Foot-Dee, and admit-
ted at Drumblade, July 11th 1764, translated to Dundee 22d
May 1765; Mr George Abel, ordained and admitted April 2d
1766, died September 1794; Mr Robert Gordon, ordained and
admitted May 1795, died 27th November 1820; Dr Robert
J.Brown, ordained and admitted 25th September 1821, translat-

<FOOTNOTE>Among the family papers at Lessendrum, there is still extant an old and curious
deed of surrender, by which Walter Byset makes over his whole lands to the Pope's
Legate, to be held by the Holy See.  It is drawn up by Willermus Lenix, clerk of the
diocese of Brechin, and runs as follows:-"In ye name of ye Lord, Amen.-In ye
year after ye incarnation 1379, on the 14th day	July, in ye 2d of ye indiction,
and in ye 1st year of ye Pontificate of ye most	holy Father in Christ, Clemment, by
Divine Providence, Pope 7th of that name.  In the presence of my notary."  &c. &c.
The original is in Latin, and written on vellum.
   N. B. At the date of this instrument there were two Popes, Urban and Clement;
the former was acknowledged by England, but the latter by Scotland.
