industrious to cultivate it to the best advantage.  In few or
no places is the tillage continued above three years in one
and the same place; and to produce a tolerable good crop
the ground must be manured some one of these years; which
is done the first, second, or third, according to the nature
of the soil; before it is again tilled it lies fallow 3 or 4
years, and sometimes longer.  The principal manure used
is the dung of housed cattle, mixed with straw, and some-
times with mud; and sea-weeds, cast in great quantities in
some places, in the winter and spring, on the shore, and
which, of a certain kind called leathagan, or tangle, that is
very rarely manufactured into kelp, the people themselves
cut during the spring tides, and carry to land in their boats.
The former is preserved in large heaps till the time of lay-

the latter for barley and potatoes.  Sowing time usually
commences about the 20th of March, and harvest seldom
before the middle of September.  Except a little barley,
small oats may be said to be the only crop produced, and
potatoes the only serviceable root.  Of this last, there are
vast quantities grown annually, which, with herring and
other fish, are the chief food of the bulk of the inhabitants
for more than half the year.

   Prices, Wages, etc.-Here, and in every other part of
the country, the prices of provisions were far lower about
30 and 40 years ago than at present.  The old people say,
that in their time the boll of meal sold for 6 merks Scots;
the double stone of butter and cheese, iron weight, for 6 s.
6 d. and other necessaries in proportion.  But these mat-
ters have since undergone a vast change; every article has
been increasing in value, and the difference of prices is now
sensibly felt.  Except in the parish of Kilmuir, and the
nearest part to it of Snizort, little or no meal, the produce
