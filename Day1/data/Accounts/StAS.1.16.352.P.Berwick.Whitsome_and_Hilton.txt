L. 342, for not many more than 342 acres.  The feu at the
east end of Whitsom belongs to John Cunningham, who
occupies also Aitchison's feu; there two feus contain 38
acres, well worth as many pounds.  The feu on the south
side is John Herriot's, of 60 acres, which are rather under-
valued at a guinea an acre, equal to L. 63.  Indeed, all the
lands about this village are most fertile excellent soil, and
fine exposure.

   9.  We shall next enumerate the farms occupied by an
opulent and considerable farmer, John Hogarth, under the
Earl of Wemyss, their proprietor:
   1st, Hurdie's-hill, already mentioned, which contains
5 families, and forms a sort of suburbs on the west end of
Whitsom.
   2 d, Hilton, about three-fourths of a mile to the east of
Whitsom, formerly a small village, with a kirk and manse,
both now in ruins, in consequence of the annexation and
the different arrangements made by the farmers.  The
Whole old parish, exclusive of Tandinfield, contains only
9 families, consisting of 50 souls.
   3 d, The West Vaults, which, along with East Vaults,
under another tenant, contains 28 souls in 7 families.
   4th, Cantrigg and Deadrigg, on the south side of the pa-
rish, containing 29 souls in seven families.  All there are
most fertile ground, especially near the old village of Hil-
ton, where the fields are not exceeded in fertility by any
part of the county at a distance from the towns.

   10.  South of Hilton lies Tondinfield, the property of
Anthony Foster, Esq; occupied by a farmer, who does not
reside upon it.  It contains 270 acres, rented at L. 220:
The soil, exposure, and cultivation excellent, as the name
seems to imply; containing, in 7 families, 32 souls.
