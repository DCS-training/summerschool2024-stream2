and some in a hat, short coat, waistcoat, and breeches of
Scotch or English manufacture.  The women are in gene-
ral very cleanly, and so excessively fond of dress, that many
maid-servants are often known to lay out their whole wages
that way.  The men in general are middle sized; there
are at present in this parish 5 men about 6 feet high, and
none exceed that height.  The height of the women is
from 5 feet 2 inches to 5 feet 6 1/2; they are in general
handsome and well complexioned.  Some spirited young
men are fond of the military profession: but here, as like-
wise in the other parts of the country, the generality seem
to have lost that martial disposition, which was so charac-
teristic of their fathers.  When any is enlisted for the ser-
vice, his relations are, for some time, inconsolable; and,
in particular, the mothers, sisters, and wives, would rather
have their respective relatives to pass the most miserable
and wretched life with themselves at home, than see them
go into the army.  If go they will, it would not give
them near the concern were it along with their chief, his
connections or dependents, with whom they are acquainted;
and who, they are impressed with the idea, have a greater
right to them, and would be more careful and tender of
them.  However, the different recruiting parties through
the country this year have been pretty successful.  The
men of Raasay are excellent fishers and excellent sea-
men; to their insular situation, perhaps, abounding
in a variety of fish, this dexterity may in a great mea-
sure be attributed; they are more expert in fishing, and
appear to be fonder of a seafaring life than most of their
neighbours.  During the spring, and greatest part of sum-
mer, numbers of them are employed in the ling and cod
fishing, and then many of them engage on board the her-
ring busses, where they commonly remain till the fishing
season is over, when they return home with their earnings,
