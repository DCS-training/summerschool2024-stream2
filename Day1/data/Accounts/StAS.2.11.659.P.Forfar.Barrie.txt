		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Extent and Bounduries.--THIS parish is computed to extend
about 3 miles from east to west, and 4 from north to south. It
is bounded on the north, by Monikie; on the south, by Monikie
and Monifieth; on the west, by Panbride; on the east, by the
German Occea and the Frith of Tay. " A high verdant bank,
which seems once to have formed a steep shore of the ocean,
runs thrnugh the whole, from east to west, giving in the
northern division the appearance of a great regular terrace,
elevated about fifty feet above the southern part. The soil
is various. The lower division is composed of a thirsty down,
which barely suffices for the grazing of a few flocks of sheep and
of young cattle, interspersed with some scres of arable land, which,
in showery seasons, yield a moderate crop of grain. The upper
division is partly light loam, partly generous gravel, and a few
fields approach to a deep black soil. The mould, though in no
respect rich, favoured by enclosure in many parts, and aided in
general by an enlightened husbandry, produces crops of wheat,
barley. oats, peas, turnip, flax, clover, potatoes, little ihferior in
quantity and quality to the growth of the same extent of land in dis-
tricts distinguished by a valuable soil."--(Old Statistical Account.)
