nufactories at Kethock's mills, on the estate of Frazerfield,
Which is opposite to Seaton, and where there is an excellent
haugh, with a command of water sufficient for driving ma-
chinery to any extent.  Goods might be easily exported
directly from the manufactory, and materials imported to
it, without the trouble and expence of land carriage.
   The Dee, which abounds with excellent salmon and trout,
is navigable for ships, so far up only as the harbour of
Aberdeen, into which ships of about 200 tons burden, if of
a proper construction, or vessels of 10 feet draught (as it is
called) can come, at high water, to the upper quay: and
this only since building the north pier, for before that time
the river was not only much shallower at the mouth than
at present, but after a storm from the east or north-east, was
liable to be blown up with land, which formed a bar at the
depth of little more than three feet from the surface, and
proved a great obstruction to the entrance of large vessels.
The water is, by means of the north pier, not only con-
fined and deepened to 18 feet and upwards, but the harbour
sheltered, in a great measure, from the storm.-Below the
town's quay are two harbours, one on the north, and the
other on the south side of the river, to both of which ships
of much larger burden than those already mentioned have
access; the one on the south side is the harbour of Tory, a
fishing-town in the parish of Nigg.
   Whether the river could be rendered navigable farther
up than Aberdeen is not certain; and it is probable that
any attempt to this purpose would answer no good end.
The tide seldom or never flows higher up than to the
bridge, which is little more than two miles from the
mouth; and there is not commonly such a quantity of wa-
ter in the river, as, without the aid of the tide, would serve
for any useful navigation, especially as there is no town or
village, except Aberdeen, on the river.
