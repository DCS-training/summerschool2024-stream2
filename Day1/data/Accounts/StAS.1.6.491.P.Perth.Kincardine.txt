Forth, viz. at Down; three have been built since that period.
-During that space also the greater part of the public roads
have received a better direction, and are well made, and brid-
ges have been built over the rivulets.
   Extensive plantations have also been made, and one half of
the parish inclosed.-Before the period above mentioned, the
greater part of the farm houses were miserable huts built of
fod, few of the holes called windows had a bit of glass in
them; and commonly there was no other partition in the
house than that formed by two beds set across it, so as to leave
a passage betwixt, upon which there was generally a door.-
Now above three fourths of the houses in the east end of the
parish are rebuilt substantially of stone or brick.  All have
glazed windows, some are covered with blue slates, and the
offices with tile.-The houses of one half of the moss te-
nants are at present in a better slate than those of the most
substantial farmers, excepting half a dozen, were formerly.-
There is also some improvement upon the mode of living of e-

connecting it with the Clyde.  When the preference was given to the canal
now executed at the mouth of the Carron, a scheme was formed for making
the Forth navigable, as far as the bridge of Gartmore, by vessels drawing on-
ly 3 1/2 feet of water, for transporting, for the use of the country upon its banks,
lime from Lord Elgin's kilns, and Abersoil, and coals from the side of Devon,
where a canal was to be made.-The distance from the mouth of the Forth
to the bridge is 27 miles, if measured in a straight line, and 49 by the course
of the river.  The tide flows to the cruives of Craigforth, distant from the
