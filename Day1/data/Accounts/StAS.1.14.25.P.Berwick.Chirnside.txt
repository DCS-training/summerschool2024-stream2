as to be injurious to the internal welfare of the people
at large.  It will be endangered, and suffer several ways,
if a proper balance between agriculture and commerce
be not attended to, and, as much as possible, maintained.
If, for the sake of working up a multiplicity of ma-

which can be managed with the sewest hands.  In years
unfavorable to the growth of corn, this abatement of
its sowing will be sensibly felt.  A loud cry, for its
dearth, soon comes from the manufacturing towns.  The
journeymen threaten to leave their works, or to have
higher wages.  Perhaps, too, a manufacture unsuccess-
ful, or not answering the expectations of its matters,
breaks up.  The disbanded workmen crowd into cities,
already in tumult, and increase the unhappy commo-

promotes that labour absolutely necessary to the life of
man, and which, while it multiplies the species, tends
