above of St. Columba, leads the author to observe, that, till
about 120 years ago, there were two churches in this parish,
one dedicted to that saint, and the other to St. Blaan.  The
walls of St. Columba's chapel are still pretty entire; but of
St. Blaan's there is no vestige.  It was probably carried away
by the river, which passed near it.  Most of the burial ground,
who belonged to it has been demolished in the same man-
ner, within a century back.

   Between St. Columba's chapel and the Castle of Dunaver-
ty, there is a bank of fine coral, above 100 yards from the
sea mark.  If the farmers had skill and industry to drag it
into boats, it would be of great service to them; and it is
found to be better manure for most heavy lands even than
lime.  The small quantity of it, found after storms, has been
of signal service to gardens and outfield lands; and when
scattered upon moor lands, it wears out the heath in a few
years.  There is also, in some vailies here, and along the banks
of the rivers, what is commonly called Fuller's earth.

   Church.-The Duke of Argyle is patron of this parish,
and has the greatest share of the property in it.  There
are 7 other heritors, 2 of whom generally reside in it.
The stipend was only 50 l. till about 10 years ago, when the
minister commenced a process before the Court of Session,
and, after some years litigation, he obtained an augmentation
of 16 l. 12 s. 10 1/3 d.  The whole living, at present, including
the allowance for communion elements, with a manse, and
glebe consisting of 6 acres, amounts to 75 l. no part of it be-
ing paid in victual. A new church was built in 1774.  There
is also a parochial about with good house, accommodated
with 4 acres of land, given by the Duke of Argyle at a mo-
derate rent.
