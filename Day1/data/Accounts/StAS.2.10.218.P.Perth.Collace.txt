ther of Lord Dunsinnan, upwards of one hundred years ago, and
the transaction being engrossed in the session records of Collace,
is in substance as follows; " The Hon. Sir William Nairne of
Dunsinnan, hath by letter under his own hand, of date 16th Au-
gust 1736, doted the seats in the east loft and those under it, to
be let, and the money to be bestowed for the benefit of teaching
of poor children in the parish of Collace."  The amount of these
during the last thirteen years was L. 11.  There has been a very
considerable falling off in this fund, which has arisen chiefly
from the erection of the new church, as it contains fewer seats
for letting, but Mr Nairne has generously made good the defi-
ciency.
 There is a library, under the patronage of Mr Nairne consist-
ing chiefly of historical, geographical, and religious books, the
foundation of which was lately laid, by a handsome donation of ex-
cellent works from the patrons, and although only in its infancy,
it is most acceptable to the people, and is rapidly diffusing a taste
for reading among them.
 Parochial Poor Funds.-These arise from the interest of money,
the use of the mortcloths, and other small sources ; but chiefly
from collections, made every Sunday after divine service in church,
which amount on an average to L. 12, 10s. a year.  Donations are
also occasionally given by Mr Nairne.  About L. 40 are annually
distributed to the poor by the kirk-sesion.
 Inns.-There is only one inn or public-house in the parish,
which is very useful, and under the best regulations, and against
which no complaint was ever made, as encouraging in the smallest
degree drunkenness or immorality.
 Fuel.-The fuel generally used in the parish is English coals
from Perth, at the average cost of 1s. per cwt.
