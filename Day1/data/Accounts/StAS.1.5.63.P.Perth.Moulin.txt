immediate rise in the wages of women servants.  Should
the machines for spinning linen yarn come to be much
and successfully used, so as to reduce the price of spinning,
that effect will be severely felt in this country.  Single
women may, perhaps, perhaps find employment in some other
branches of manufacture; but it does not appear in what
other way married women, who must fit always at home
with their children, can contribute any thing to the sup-
port of their families.

   Exports.-The principal export is linen yarn, which
may be estimated thus:  The women, from 10 years old
and upwards, employ themselves in spinning linen yarn,
almost wholly for sale, from the beginning or middle of
November, till about the end of March, a period of 21
weeks.  Of the 789 females above 8 years of age, 272,
who are married, may be supposed to spin at the rate of
one spindle the week.  From the remainder, 517, one
fifth part, 103, may be deducted, consisting of girls, old
women, etc. whose work cannot be reckoned of any ac-
count.  The rest, 414, may be supposed to spin at the
rate of two spindles.  Hence the quantity spun in the a-
bove period of 21 weeks, will be:

   Thus it may be reckoned, that 23,000 spindles, spun
for sale, during the spinning season, and sold out of the
parish at 2 s. 4 d. the spindle, bring a return in cash, of
L. 2683:6:8.  This quantity of yarn exhausts about
2200 stones of lint, in the state it comes from the mill.
