the Ochil hills, about 5 or 6 miles above, and runs through
a deep and narrow glen for a considerable way, before it
issues into the plain; and after a short course directly north
it bends to the east, and loses itself in the river Earn, at a
place, which derives its name from it, called Culfargie.
Though this river is often almost dry in summer, yet after
long continued rains, or heavy summer showers, it swells in-
to a dreadful torrent, and bursts from its narrow channel in-
to the level of the Strath, with such irresistible impetuosity
as to sweep all before it.  It abounds with fine trout, and
is the scene of an agreeable amusement to the angler in the
proper season.  Mineral springs are frequent here, and
by their scum and sediment, indicate the existence of me-
tals in the neighbouring mountains.  They are mostly of
the chalybeate kind, but are not used for any medicinal
purpose, though, if tried, they might probably be found of
service for bracing the stomach and nerves.  There are
some veins of limestone in the parish; but what has yet
been discovered, is of an inferior kind.  It is not however
improbable, that if fuel could be procured for burning it at
a moderate expense, veins of good lime might be found on
a more accurate search; an article of great importance to
the farmer, who at present is obliged to import it from
Lord Elgin's lime-works at Charlestown, or to bring it in
carts from the hills of Fife, the Lomonds, or Forthar, at
the distance of 8 or 10 miles.  There is some free-stone;
but seldom wrought, except on a particular demand.  The
appearances of coal are so great, that many attempts have
been made to discover it, by digging, boring, &c. but hi-
therto without success.  Three different trials have been
made within this parish since the year 1758, and sanguine
hopes have been entertained, but as often disappointed.
Our nearest coal-mines are at Keltie, at the distance of 18
