   Coal.-This parish is full of coal, for which there is great
demand.  It likewise abounds in free-stone.  The coal is of
a fine quality, and is the only fuel used in the parish.  It is
carried to London, to the northmost parts of Scotland, to
Holland, Germany, and the Baltic.  It sells at a higher price
on the hill, and to the country people who live near, and
therefore must use it, than any coal in Scotland.  It lies very
deep; this may be one cause of its high price.  There are
above 100 carts employed in the coal works, to drive coals to
the sea and the salt pans.
