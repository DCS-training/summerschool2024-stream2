provement.

   Seed-time and Harvest.-The seed-time is much the same
here as in other parts of the country, but the harvest is late,
being seldom general before the end of September, and some-
times not till the beginning of the month following.  There
is hardly any possibility of hastening it by sowing earlier, as
the ground, from-various causes, is not sooner in case to re-
ceive or nourish the seed; to sow grain therefore of the ear-
liest kind that can be procured, is the only probable method
of providing against this material inconvenience.  Those ge-
nerally raised here are oats, and common or rough bear, in
contradistinction to barley, sometimes rye, seldom pease,
which, unless in favourable seasons, do not ripen.  Potatoes
commonly thrive well, and make a great part of the food
not only of the poorer sort, but of the generality, in the end
of autumn and during the whole of winter.  In common
they are dressed with milk, and make both a palatable and
wholesome meal*.

   Goad and bad Seasons.-No particular incident has marked

*Hardly any root cultivated in this country is so generally
agreeable, and suited, at once, to the taste, both of the luxuri-
ous and of the poor, of children, and grown persons, as the
potatoe, yet perhaps no root whatever is, taken by itself, more
insipid and tasteless.  Its agreeableness is perhaps owing to this
very cause, as we find those foods that affect the palate most
strongly, though ever so agreeably, most quickly lose their re-
lish, and soonest become disagreeable or nauseous; and presump-
tion, at least, that the simplest foods are the most conducive to
health, because most agreeable to nature.
