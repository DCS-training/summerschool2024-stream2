remedies.  Anxious, however, about the prosperity, and ar-
dently wishing to promote the industry of these parishes, he
begs leave to submit to the consideration of the discerning
few, the following improvements:
   1mo, A good road for the post, through the middle of the
islands of Burray and South Ronaldsay.
   2do, That the proprietors grant at least a nineteen years
lease, to each of their tenants, for a certain rent, one half of
which to be payable in money, the other half in kind; the
money rent to be paid in 6 months after his entry, the rent
in kind in 18 months after his entry, and so on during the
the lease.  Each tenant to receive from his proprietor one
or two carts, at the option of the tenant, the value of which
to be estimated by two persons mutually chosen, and paid by
the tenant in such moities, and in such time as can be agreed
on.  No services to be demanded of the tenant.
   3tio, That the tenants be encouraged to labour rather with
oxen than horses, many of which die yearly.
   4to, That there be two schools erected in South Ronald-
say, and one in Burray, for the education of youth.
