great advantage to this district, to the town of Cupar in
Angus, and to great part of the back country, where they
are obliged to fetch their coal and lime from Perth or Dun-
dee, at a much greater distance than the head of the in-
tended canal would be.  The little expense that would be
incurred in cutting a canal through a country almost per-
fectly level, would very soon be repaid by a trifling
duty.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The living consists of 27 bolls
of barley, 2 of wheat, and 4 of oat-meal, and L. 365
Scots.  Part of the stipend is paid out of certain funds be-
longing to the Cathedral of Dunkeld.  A grant for L. 42
was procured from the Crown in 1744, to be divided a-
mong the ministers of Dunkeld, Bervie and Abernyte;
but from the manner in which the money is collected, they
are able to realize only about 8 guineas each.  The whole
stipend may be worth L. 62.  The glebe consists of about
10 acres, one half of which is rocky pasture ground.  The
King is patron.-The schoolmaster's salary is only 100
merks Scots, with a house and garden.  The scholars may
amount to 30.  The fees are, for reading, 1 s. for writing,
arithmetic and latin, 1 s. 6 d.; the whole living, including
session-clerk's emoluments, does not amount to L. 15 a-
year.-The average number of poor maintained by the
parish is 3 or 4.  The fund for supporting them arises from
contributions on Sundays, and some small fees for the use
of the pall, &c.  The annual amount of the collections
and fees is about L. 13.  This fund is more than sufficient
for the maintenance of the poor, and has been accumu-
lating for several years past.  No person belonging to the
parish is permitted to beg.  The poor, in general, earn
some part of their own subsistence, though there are occa-
sionally some whose whole support must be derived from
