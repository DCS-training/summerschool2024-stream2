acres more have been recovered (summer 1840,) solely at the tenant's
own expense. In several parts of the parish, a great deal
of moorland also is in course of being brought under cultivation,
partly at the expense of the proprietor, (Lord Lovat,) and partly
at the expense of the different tenants. Also, on the estate of
Reelick, which is almost altogether now in the proprietor's own
hands, a great deal of waste land, and what had ever before been
a perfect morass, has been improved by thorough draining, &c.,
and yields now the finest crops. About L. 1100 have been expended,
during last season, in improving different portions of this
property; and such improvements are still carried on.
   Navigation.-A considerable number of vessels land at two
places on the Beauly Frith, viz. Fopachy and Wester Lovat; but
there is no harbour nor any proper sort of landing-place. These
import lime and coals, and export timber and grain. The former
has, of late, been exported to a great extent from this parish. These
vessels are schooners, brigs, and sloops.

                    V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The whole population belongs to the Established
Church, with the exception of six families: and there are
five families of Roman Catholics. The glebe is ten acres in extent,
and worth about L. 2 per acre. The manse is at present in
very good condition, having been greatly enlarged and entirely
repaired, about fourteen years ago.
   Education.-There are two schools in the parish. The parochial
schoolmaster's salary is L. 30: his fees may amount to L. 15
or L. 20.
   Poor.-The average number of persons receiving parochial aid
is about 60. The amount of contributions for their relief is betwixt
L.20 and L. 30, all arising from church collections, excepting an
occasional donation from proprietors.
