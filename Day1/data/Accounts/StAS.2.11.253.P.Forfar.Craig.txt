    There is nothing remarkable in the personal qualities of the
people.
    The number of insane is 2; fatuous 3; blind, 2; deaf and
dumb none.
    In their general character the people are intelligent and moral,
and attentive to the public ordinances of religion. About thirty
years ago, and even to a later period, the smuggling of gin and
brandy from Holland prevailed to a great extent; and great quan-

traders. But the establishment of the coast guard has completely
prevented the former practice; and, since the smaller stills have
improved the quality of their spirits, the latter has been almost en-
tirely abolished.
