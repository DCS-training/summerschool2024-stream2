bers. The fund amounted in 1826 to L.267, 8s. 9 1/2d. At pre-
sent it is L.329, 10s. 5 1/2d. and the number of members 79.
   Poor.-The poor are supported by assessment, and those who
may want occasional aid are relieved by the money collected in
church on Sunday. Assessment produces here, as wherever it has
been introduced, a carelessness about providing for old age, but it
would be improper not to mention that the highest spirit of inde-
pendence is exhibited by many as long as nature will permit.
The average number upon the poors' roll for the last year is 50 1/2,
and the different rates by which the poor are paid quarterly vary
from L.2, 5s. 6d. to 10s. The amount of assessment from Mar-
tinmas 1830 to 1831 is L.270, 9s. 1d., and the number of months'
cess 13.
   The system of poor rates commenced here in 1763; the num-
ber of months' cess then charged was 2 1/2, and the sum L.44, 12s.
4d. The highest amount of assessment was in 1819, when it was
L.416, and the number of months cess 20. The greatest ave-
rage of paupers on the roll was 62 in 1820, and the smallest 16
in 1766.
   Inns.-There are six inns and alehouses in the parish. Such
a proportion for the population is far too high, and hence they are
a great evil to the lower orders.
   Fuel.-Coal and lime are brought from North Durham; and
the distance (15 miles) at which the collieries are situated consti-
tutes one of the greatest disadvantages under which the parish
labours.
               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The most striking differences between the present state of the
parish and its condition when the last Statistical Account was
drawn up, a period of 38 years, are in the following particulars:
The rental has nearly doubled. The number of tenants in 1793
was 56, now it is 36. Previous to 1793 the population was ad-
vancing at the rate of 727 in a century, or about 7 1/4 per annum.
Now it is at 240 per century, or about 2 1/4 per annum. The poor
have increased 13 1/4; and the poor rates have trebled. The regis-
tered births, deaths, and marriages have all diminished by the re-
spective numbers, 49, 3 1/2, 1 2/5.
