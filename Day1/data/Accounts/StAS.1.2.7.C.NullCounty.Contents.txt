" had establihed, in 1743, a general correspon-
" dence, both with clergy and laity, for preparing a
" scheme, which was afterwards ratified by Parlia-
" liament, for a provision for ministers widows:
" That he had improved that correspondence, for
" the purpose of procuring lists, either of individuals,
" or, or persons above a certain age, in the diffe-
" rent parishes of Scotland:  That, when the lifts
" contained only those above a certain age, he cal-
" culated the amount of the whole inhabitants, by
" the proportion, which they might be supposed
" to bear, to the number of souls, according to the
" most approved tables, compared with the fact in
" many parts of Scotland, where the ministers, at
" his desire, not only numbered their parishioners,
" but distinguished their respective ages:  So that,
" it is humbly apprehended, the account he has giv-
" en, of the number of the people, is sufficiently
" exact to answer every valuable purpose."  Doctor
Webster's well known character for accuracy, and
the success, with which his calculations have been
uniformly attended, ought to satisfy every one, that
the report he drew up may be safely relied on; and
above all, he had every inducement to make the po-
pulation of Scotland rather large, than otherwise;
since the report was to be laid before the Govern-
ment at the time, in whose eyes, he would natural-
ly be inclined to place his native country, in as fa-
vourable and respectable a light as possible.
