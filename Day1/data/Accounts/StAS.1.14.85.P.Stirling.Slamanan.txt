lors, or unmarried men; and 20 unmarried women
above 40 years of age; there are also 17 widowers and
42 widows.  The inhabitants of the annexation were
always considered to be nearly equal to one half of the
old parish; at present, however, they are a great deal

3 millers, and 1 lint-miller, 3 flax-dressers, 3 public-

ed by the Carron Company, and are sometimes more
numerous than at other times.  There were more than
20 of them about 2 years ago, and at present there are
not more than 5.  There is 1 clergyman and 1 school-
master; but no surgeon nor writer.  There are about
