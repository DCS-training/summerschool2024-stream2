the Clyde, must be attented with very advantageous con-
sequences to the nation.  The number of vessels that fail
upon it, loaded with all kinds of merchandise, and some of
them from sea to sea, is daily increasing.-The history of
the Bargarran witches, in the neighbouring parish of Er-
skine, is well known to the curious.  That this parish, in the
dark ages, partook of the same frenzy, and that innocent per-
sons were sacrificed at the shrine of cruelty, bigotry, and
superstition, cannot be concealed.  As late as the end of the
last century, a woman was burnt for witchcraft at Sandy-
ford, near the village, and the bones of the unfortunate vic-
tim were lately found at the place.  While ew review
with pity and regret, the deplorable situation of human na-
ture at the time, we feel a sensible pleasure in contempla-
ting the change that has already taken place, which is in-
deed highly increased, by indulging the fond hope, that the
period is fast approaching, when all kinds of superstition and
bigotry, will for ever be banished, from the face of the earth.
