Dei.  If the first be adopted, we may suppose the name took
its rise from the place having been once in a high state of
cultivation, probably from the introduction of the Italian agri-
culture.  But if the second, it may denote the residence of
some of the Culdees, or a place appropriated to the worship
of God, either by the Culdees or the Druids.  For on the
south end of the Cuninghar, the rude remains of a Druidical
circle are still to be seen, and on the north-east extremity of
the rising ground, the old church was situated.  The writer
hereof is no admirer of the Gaelic; but as Gaelic deriva-

which in miniature resemble those of the Forth.  The shape
of the whole parish is a rhomboid or an oblong, which has
the two longest sides on the E. and W. each measuring al-
most 6 English miles.  The S. side of the oblong measures
