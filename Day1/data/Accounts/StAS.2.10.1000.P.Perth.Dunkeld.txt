	The iron jowgs, for confining petty offenders, which hung on the
	side of the old church door, were ordered to be replaced at the
	door of tbe new church, where they now hang as a memorial of
	the rude olden times. On the east wall, are the family arms of
	Bishop Brown, the founder of the church.  The burial-yard sur-
	rounds the edifice.
		The Rev. Donald Munro, the Gaelic assistant to the present
	incumbent, resides in Dowally. There is worship every Sunday,
	and the sacrament is dispensed once a year.  The service is per-
	formed both in English and in Gaelic.
		Education.-There was no regular school prior to 1780. The
	Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge fixed one of their
	schools in the parish, which was productive of great good. After
	it was withdrawn, one of the parishioners opened a school for the
	common branches of education, which he taught up to 1832.
	On an application from the inhabitants to the Atholl trustees,
	they, in 1833, appointed a parochial teacher.  The salary is the
	maximum, L.34, 4s. 4 1/2d. with school fees.  He has as yet no
	dwelling-house. The school-house, erected in 1836, has been
	found too small, and is to be enlarged.  The attendance is irre-
	gular.
		Poor.-The funds are derived from the church collections and
	the mortcloth dues.  They are divided monthly among the poor,
	and consequently the division is greater in some months than in
	others. They receive assistance from the farmers. In sickness,
	they are visited by their neighbours, and every relief and attend-
	ance given without ostentation or parade.  The Atholl family
	gives them fuel and free houses.
