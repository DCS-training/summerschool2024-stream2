John Wood and Company, ship-builders in Port-Glasgow, to build
a boat for him, which he called the Comet. * On 18th January
1812, the Comet began to ply between Glasgow and Greenock,
and made five miles an hour against a head wind, whilst, by simply
increasing her power, she went at the rate of seven miles an hour.
This was the first vessel that was successfully propelled on a na-
vigable river in Europe, and it is very remarkable, that, notwith-
standing the great progress in mechanical science, no improvement
has yet been made on Mr Bell's mode; although numerous efforts
have been made here and elsewhere for that purpose. It is true
that boats go swifter now than formerly, but the propelling system
remains the same. To this brief account of the origin of the
steam-propelling system in this country, it must be added that the
Americans preceded is fully four years. In October 1807, Mr
Robert Fulton, an American engineer, launched a steam-boat at
New York, which plied with great effect between that city and
Albany, a distance of 160 miles.

<FOOTNOTE>The progress in steam navigation of late years is truly wonderful. In January
1812, there was not a steam-boat in Europe excepting the "Comes," of three horse
power, at Glasgow. Now almost every navigable river in Europa is teeming with
them. Some of the Glasgow bosts have now upwards of 240 horse power.
