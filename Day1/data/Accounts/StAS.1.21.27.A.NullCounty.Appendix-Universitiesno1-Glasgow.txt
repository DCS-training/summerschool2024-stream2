sions were wanting which it ought to have, but cannot for the
present possibly have for want of revenue.  In this report the
visitors were unanimous.
   In this state the University remained till after the Revolu-
tion.  It is true, that, in this interval, it received several con-
siderable donations and mortifications: but these were all ap-

   In the year 1693, each of the Scottish universities obtained
a gift of L. 300 a-year out of the bishops rents in Scotland.
The sum payable to the University of Glasgow, was allocated
upon the income of the archbishopric of Glasgow; and soon
after, still better to secure the payment, the College obtained a
lease of the whole rent of the archbishopric for 19 years, which
lease has from time to time been renewed by the Crown.

this time were encouraged by the great number of her students.
Principal STIRLING, in his diary, says, that in the year 1702
the students of theology, Greek, and philosophy, amounted
to upwards of 402.  The great demand for clergymen, to

of the Presbyterian government, occasioned the attendance of
a greater number of students about the beginning of this cen-
tury, than at any former period.
   In the year 1706, the profession of humanity was revived;
and Mr Andrew Rots was appointed professor.
   In the year 1708, her Majesty Queen ANNE was pleased
