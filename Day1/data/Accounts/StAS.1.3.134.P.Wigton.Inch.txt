     NUMBER XVI.

     PARISH OF INCH.

     (County of Wigton.)

     By the Rev. Mr PETER FERGUSSON.

     Situation, Name, Extent, and Surface.

   THE parish of Inch is situated in the county of Wigton,
the presbytery of Stranraer, and synod of Galloway.
Opposite to the small village of Inch, where the church now
stands, is an island, whence, in all probability, the parish de-
rived its name; the word for Island, in the Gaelic language,
being similar in sound to the name of the parish.  This island is
situated in the loch of Castle Kennedy, and is about 600 
yards in circumference.  In this island there was formerly a
place of worship, vestiges of which are still remaining; and
it communicated with the land by a causeway and draw-
bridge.  The names of places in this parish, and indeed, in
all the county, are Gaelic; and are in general characteristic
of the local situation, or of some peculiar circumstance.
The parish of Inch is nine miles long, and in some parts the
same in breadth.  About one half of the parish consists
of flat and low land, forming an extensive plain, which
stretches from Lochryan, nearly to the bay of Luce.  On
the east and north-east of this plain, rises a beautiful range
of hills, reaching from one end of the parish to the other.
The face these is partly green pasture, and partly arable
