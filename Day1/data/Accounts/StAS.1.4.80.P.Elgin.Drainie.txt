   River and Lakes.-The river Lossie has its source in the
hills of Dallas; and, after a course of near 26 measured
miles, discharges itself into the sea at the town of Lossie-
mount, in the N. E. corner of this parish.  It is too small
to be navigable beyond its mounth, and its bed too sandy to
be favourable to salmon; yet about 3 or 4 score of that fish
have sometimes been taken in a season, at its entry into
the sea.  It abounds with excellent red spotted trout, from
1 lb. to 3 lb. and even sometimes 4 lb. in weight, called
here phinnocks.-The loch of Spynie is a beautiful piece
of fresth water, about 1 mile broad and 3 miles long, which
discharges itself into the river Lossie, about a mile from
the sea.  It abounds with eel and pike, and water-fowl of
various kinds; such as, swans, geese, duck, teal, etc.  This
loch, at some former period, appears evidently to have form-
ed a bay of the sea, and to have been connected with ano-
ther loch in the parish of Urquhart, called Cotts, which is
only half a mile distant.  The mount of this bay is formed
by 2 banks of hard gravel about 500 yards asunder, and
the water of Lossie passing through this opening, seems, in 
a series of ages, to have carried down such a quantity of
sand, as to have at length separated these lochs from each
other, and shut up their communmication with the sea.  The
beds of shells all around the loch of Spynie, and the names
of places in the neighbourhood, clearly prove that it has
formerly been connected with the sea; and there are also
some written evidences of the same fact.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, School, etc.-The church was
built more than 100 years ago, and looks tolerably decent
without, but is very naked and ill finished within.  Our
