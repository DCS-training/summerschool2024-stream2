ly,--an abundant supply of which is brought by sea from the Eng-
lish coast to Dumfries, and sold about 8s. the cart load, or from

		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Great changes in dress, mode of living, comfort in dwelling-
houses, and improvements in farming have taken place in this place in this pa-
rish within these last forty years. In 1791, the real rent of the pa-
rish was L. 1500; now it is L.3690.
	The greatest improvement wanted in this and in some of the
neighbouring parishes, is the draining of Lochar Moss.
	It is little more than eight years since the cultivation of turnips
was general in this parirh. We may notice, that the higher
grounds in this parish afford the most extensive prospect in the
south of Scotland. From one point you have a full view of the
Solway Frith, several ports both on the English and Scotch sides,
the Isle of Man, and many of the neighbouring counties; the
greatest part of Dumfries-shire, Galloway, part of Lanarkshire,
Peebles-shire; Northumberland, and Cumberland, in England. At
the western extremity of the parish, a person standing on one par-
ticular spot, can throw a stone into each of the four neighbouring
parishes, Torthorwald, Dumfries, Caerlaverock, and Ruthwell, all
terminating on the side of the river Lochar, near to this point.
