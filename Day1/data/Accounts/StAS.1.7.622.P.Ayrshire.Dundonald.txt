this kind of manure than to cart it from the neighbouring
parishes of Symington and Riccartoun.  They have likewise

and moss already mentioned, the parish produces more than

The attention of the farmers has, of late years, been turned
to the rearing of young cattle, both horses and cows, and to
the making of sweet-milk cheese.  Both must in a short
time be highly beneficial to the country; much money hav-

parish 235 draught horses, 120 young ditto, 14 bulls, 597
milch cows, 782 young ditto, bulls and stots; 433 black cat-
tle feeding for market; 1090 sheep, viz. 603 of the small
kind and black faced, 338 of a mixed breed between the
English and Scotch, white faced; a Turkish ram brought
by Colonel Fullerton from Constantinople in 1790, and 48
lambs the offspring of this foreigner, and ewes of the mixed
breed.

antient practice still continues in this parish and neighbour-
hood of kindling a large fire, or tawnle as it is usually termed,
of wood, upon some eminence, and making merry around it,
