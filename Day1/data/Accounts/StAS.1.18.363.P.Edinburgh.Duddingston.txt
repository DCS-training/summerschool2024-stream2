neighbouring gentlemen, who must quickly have observed
the singular benefit which resulted from this experiment.
The prosecution of such improvements, however, at any dis-
tance from the city, might at that period have been much
if not totally obstructed, from the state of the roads, which
were generally ruinous, and often impassable in the winter
season.  It might arise partly from this circumstance, which
formed also another obstacle to cultivation; that it was not
till after the year 1750, that carts came to be in general use;
at least to the west of Edinburgh, though they had been long
employed upon the east side, the conveyance of all materials
having been before that period, in sacks, hurdles or creels,
upon the backs of horses.  About 1730, the offais and ma-
nure of the streets of Edinburgh sold at 2 d per cart: At
present, the cart load in some circumstances sells at 1 s 6 d,
or upwards; though in most cases, the streets and other
sources of such unsightly treasures, are let by general or ex-
tensive contracts.
   The estate of Dudingston, was much later in undergoing
any effective improvement.  The tenants originally possessed
their lands in run-ridge or run-dale; and in each of the vil-
lages of Wester and Easter Dudingston in which they resided,
they had access to a common, upon which they pastured their
sheep, horses, and other cattle, which were kept by a common
herd.  It is somewhat remarkable, that before the year 1746,
there never was an instance of a lease upon that estate; yet
it is believed, there is not an older or more respectable ten-
antry in Scotland; several of the families of the present ten-
ants having been in possession of their farms for upwards of
200 years.  About the year 1751, the proprietor, the late
Earl of Abercorn, began to subdivide his estate into commo-
dious farms, to build convenient farm-houses, and offices
upon each, and to inclose them with ditches and hedges.
