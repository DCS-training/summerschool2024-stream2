the gills; it is then cut up at the back, on each side the
bone or chain, as it is commonly called.  The bone is ta-
ken out, but the tail, with two or three inches of the bone
is left; the head is cut off; all the guts are taken out; but
the skin of the belly is left uncut; the fish is then laid, with
the skin undermost, on a board, and is well rubbed, and
covered over with a mixture of equal quantities of com-
mon salt and Jamaica pepper.  Some of this mixture is
carefully spread under the fins to prevent them from cor-
rupting, which they are exceedingly ready to do, especially
if the weather is warm.  A board with a large stone is
sometimes laid upon the fish, with a view to make the salt
penetrate into it more effectually.  In some places, as
Dumbarton, instead of a flat board, a shallow wooden
trough is used, by which means the brine is kept about
the fish; sometimes two or three salmons are kippered in
the same vessel at the same time, one being laid upon the
other.  The fish, with the board or trough, is set in a cool
place for two or three days; it is then removed from the
board, and again rubbed with salt and pepper, after which
it is hung up by the tail, and exposed to the rays of the
sun, or the heat of the fire.  Care is previously taken to
stretch out the fish by means of small sticks or hoops placed
across it from side to side.  After it has remained in the
heat a few days, it is hung up in the kitchen, or other dry
place, till used.  Every method is taken to keep the fish
from putrefaction.  It is an error to suppose, as some have
ignorantly done, that kippered salmon means corrupted
salmon.
   Some people, in order to give the kipper a peculiar
taste, highly relished by not a few, carefully smoke it with
peat reek, or the reek of Juniper bushes.  This is com-
monly done by hanging it up so near a chimney in which
peats, or Juniper bushes are burnt, as that it receives the
