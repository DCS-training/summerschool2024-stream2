and the youth are not exposed to the contagion of those
vices which unhappily prevail in large towns.
   About the middle of the last century, John Wood, Esq;
proprietor of the lands of Orkie, destined that property
after his death for erecting a free grammar school in the
parish of Drumelry, alias Newburn, and maintaining six
poor scholars thereat.  The rent of these lands is now
about L. 140 Sterling per annum, and the parochial
schoolmaster educates and maintains the poor scholars on
Mr Wood's mortification, as it is called in Scottish law
language; for he officiates in a double capacity, being
chosen both by the heritors and the patrons of the mor-
tification already mentioned.  By the deed, 'Sir Thomas
'Gourlay of Kincraig,' etc. 'the minister of Newburn,'
etc. and 'their successors whatsomever, are appointed
'lawful, undoubted patrons of the foundation and mor-
tification in all time coming.'  Boys of the sirname of
Wood are always to have a preference.

beside their victuals.  The wages of the day-labourer is

ing hay he gets, per day, 1 s. 6 d.  The day wages of a
mason is from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s.; of a tailor 1 s. when he
furnishes provisions to himself; and when victuals are pro-
vided for him, 6 d.
   The average price of beef is 3 1/2 d. per lb.; of veal, 3 1/2 d.;
and of mutton the same.  The price of a hen, at an average,
is 1 s.; of a duck, 9 d.; of a pig fit for table, 5 s. Butter
is about 8 d. per lb.  But the price of labour and provi-
sions, in general, is more than doubled within there 30
years.
