the oats.  The farms in both districts are of different sizes,
from 10 l. to 130 l.  Part of the parish is let in small posses-
sions of a few acres to trades people, and this is one reason
for the great number of ploughs and horses; as there are
often a plough and two horses, where the possession does
not exceed twelve acres.  Where the farmer does not
carry on his work with the assistance of his children, it
is generally done by servants who live in the family, except
in harvest, for which additional assistance is secured some
months before.  Sometimes a house, kail-yard, and an acre
of land, are given to trades people, who pay their rent by
assisting in harvest, and at turnip cleaning.  Oats are sown
from the middle of March to the middle of April; then
pease and lint-seed.  Bear is sown in May, and turnips in
June.  The harvest generally begins in the end of August:
It is somewhat later in the northern district.  The parish
more than supplies itself with grain; considerable quantities
of it, particularly of barley, are sold out of it.

   Roads and Bridges.-The great road, from Coupar of Angus
to Fort George, passes through this parish.  It was made at
the expence of Government, and is kept in good repair by
the statute labour of the country, with the occasional assist-
ance of military parties.  It is regretted, that a different di-
rection was not given it, after it reached Blair-Gowrie.  Had
it been made to cross the Ericht at Blair-Gowrie, run a-
long the east side of that river, re-cross it near Craig-hall,
and keep lower down in its course through Mawes, the high
ground, over which it now passes, would have been avoided,
and the traveller would have been saved many a long and
steep ascent.  The great road from Dunkeld to Kirriemuir,
also passes through the parish, and cuts the military road at
right angles: It is kept in tolerable repair The cross roads
are many.  Till lately, the statute labour was exacted in
