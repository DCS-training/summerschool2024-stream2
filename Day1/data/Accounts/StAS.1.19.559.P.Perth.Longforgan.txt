     of Longforgan.

   Antiquities.-The remains of antiquity in this parish are
but few.  Castle-Huntly, already described, is the only
building which has any claim to antiquity, since the old
church at Longforgan was taken down.  In the midst of a
plantation of firs, which was part of the muir of Forgan
about 30 years ago, is a tumulus or barrow; its central
mound about 5 or 6 yards high, and 28 yards diameter;
the surrounding ditch, out of which probably the earth had
been taken for its formation, 10 yards wide.  It still bears
the name of the Market Knowe, (knoll), as the markets
were held there formerly; and the country people remark,
that although the whole ground round it was then covered
with health and broom, the Knowe always preserved a
beautiful green sward.  Some openings have been made in
it, and coffins found, consisting of four rude longitudinal
stones, and two smaller ones at each end, containing human
skeletons.
   A few years ago there was found, somewhere about this
tumulus, an earthen pot, containing 700 silver pieces, about
the size of a sixpence.  Upon one side a head crowned, with
Edward, very distinct; and on the reverse a cross, with . . .

and four pieces, also of silver, same size; on one side a
crowned head, round it, Alexander Dei gratia; and on the
reverse a cross, with a star of six rays in each division, and
round it, Scotorum Rex, very plain.  These were found by
a man in this parish, whose business gave him frequent op-
portunities to be about the place, and privately sold to a
shopkeeper in Dundee for L. 10 or L. 12; and it was by the
greatest accident the circumstance came very lately to the
knowledge of the author of this paper, who has now a
piece of each in his possession.  He had his information first
from a very respectable tradesman in Dundee, who is also
an ingenious antiquary, who saw them all counted, about
