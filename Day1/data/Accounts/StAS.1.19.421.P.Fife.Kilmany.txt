     of Kilmany.

Cupar, the county town, and the seat of the presbytery.  It
is scattered along the shallow and narrow water of Mo-
tray*, which unites, in the western extremity of the parish,
two small streams, issuing from different sides of Norman's
Law, and which, after a short and gentle course, falls into
the river Eden, not far from the bay of St Andrew's.
A little attention to the pleasing irregularities in the ground
on which Kilmany is situated, and through which the rivu-
let flows, might have made it a beautiful picture of rural
scenery.  But how seldom has such attention either chosen
the situations, or arranged the forms, of the largest towns!
Accident, or the idea of conveniency, which can seldom be
hurt by a regard to beauty, is allowed to have in these mat-
ters too powerful an influence; and in the position of the
straggling huts of this village, as in that of many other
places, we have to lament the carelessness which can build
in a beautiful place of residence, and yet neglect to take
advantage of the aids which the scenery at once furnishes
and suggests, to decorate the dwellings of men, and from
these thus decorated, to derive ornaments in addition to its
own.

   The church+ stands on a beautiful bank, rising gradually
from the stream, which flows past it on the S.; is skirted on
the W. by some tall ashes; and fronts the hill of Forrit,
once covered with firs, but now stript of the whole.  No
little clump has been left upon any of its brows; not even

*The water could not float any kind of vessel for transporting corn.

+So late as the year 1768, the church was renewed.  The building is
simple and neat but unfortunately, the long narrow form in which almost
all the old churches in this part of the country are constructed, has been too
much retained.  It seems strange, that there should have been so prevalent
a partiality to a form of building, of all others least fitted for public
speaking.
