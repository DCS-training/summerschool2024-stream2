     Statistical Account

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls, in 1755, was 53 L.  The population, as
appears from the records of the parish, is much the same
that it has been for 100 years past, and amounts to about
600 souls.  The annual number of births, for 50 years
past, is 18; of deaths, 13; of marriages, 6.  We have no
instances on record of remarkable longevity.  Many, how-
ever, have reached their 90th year, and there are some
persons now living, of that age.

   The tradesmen and mechanicks are,

   Rent, Heritors, etc.-The land-rent of the parish is at
present about L. 2000 a-year; but as the most extensive
farms are at present low rented, it might easily rise to
L. 3000 a-year.  There are 12 heritors, 3 of whom only
are resident; George Somerville, Esq; of Airhouse, Hen-
ry Torrans of Kirktonhill, James Justice of Justicehall.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Peat and turf, of which
there is plenty in the parish, was formerly the only fuel
used by the inhabitants.  But since the public roads were
made, and kept in good repair, coal, although brought
from a distance of 12 miles, is found by our proprietors
and farmers, to be on the whole the cheapeast fuel.  This
change is to be attributed to the advanced price of labour,
which makes the expense of procuring peat and turf, when
every thing is considered, greater than that of coal*.
