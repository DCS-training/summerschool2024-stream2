     Statistical Account

   Eminent Men.-This parish has produced no eminent men
whose history hath arrested the attention of world, except
Mr Bell of Antermony, a gentleman well known to the learn-
ed, on account of his travels to China and Persia; this gen-
tleman possessed an uncommon faculty for speaking the mo-
dern languages of Europe; nor was he less remarkable for an
amiable simplicity of manners, in private life, and the most
sacred regard to truth in all he said or did.  He was a na-
tive of Campsie, having inherited a considerable paternal e-
state: he died in the 1780, at the venerable age of 89.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-Provisions of every sort
in this parish are regulated by the Glasgow prices; the
common people have such an inveterate custom of carrying
their eggs, poultry, and butter, to town, that we could of-
ten buy these articles cheaper at the cross of Glasgow than
in the parish of Campsie.  I have subjoined a table of the
prices of provisions and of labour, for the year 1794.

<FOOTNOTE>

tants of this district are fond of literary pursuits, it would be doing them
injustice, if I did not say they were people of capacity and genius; at the
same time, the tendency of their mind is rather towards an active than a con-
templative life.
