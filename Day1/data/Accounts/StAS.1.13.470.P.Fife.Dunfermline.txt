period it does not appear tha coal was wrought to a great 
extent.  It was only used in the abbey, and by persons of
distinction in the country.  In progress of time it was more
generally used as fuel; and when trade began to flourish, it
was exported to foreign parts.  Although it was worked
by crop levels ever since the above mentioned period, there
was little exported till about the middle of this century.
Even so late as 1763, the annual value of exported coal
was only L. 200; and in 1771, it did not exceed L. 500
Sterling.  The coal-mines, since 1771, have been sources
of great wealth to many of the proprietors.

   Description of the Subterraneous Coal Strata.-The first
appearance of coal on the S. W. extremity of the parish,
is a seam about 2 feet thick, situated under the Earl of 
Elgin's lime-rock at Charlestown.  Northward, near broad-
hills, there is another seam, from 4 to 6 feet thick, which
dips very rapidly towards the N. E. the crop of which
has been wrought by a level in the same direction.  Ad-
vancing still northward, about 3 miles from the Frith,
through a fine level country, we again find various seams
of excellent coal in the lands of Sir Charles Halket of Pit-
ferran, immediately above the village of Crossord.  From
a remote period, the family of Pitteran, obtained from
Government, the privilege of exporting these coals to
foreign parts, free of all duty whatever.  The original pri-
vilege was renewed by Queen Anne on December 21.
