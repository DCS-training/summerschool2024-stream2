                         PARISH OF STAIR.

                     PRESBYTERY AND SYNOD OF AYR.

                 THE REV. WILLIAM RORISON, MINISTER.

                  I-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        STAIR was first erected in  to a parish in 1073 for the accommo-
dation of the noble family of Dalrymple of Stair, whose residence
as a great distance from Ochiltree, their parish church. With
a view to this accommodation, that family agreed to pay three
chalders of victual, one-half of the stipend then allotted to the
minister. The other half was to be paid by the parish of Barn-
weil, then suppressed and united to the adjoining parishes of
Craigie and Tarbolton. On account of some differences between
the parties concerned in the transaction, and a wrong locality of
the stipend, the errors of the first erection were rectified by a new
process in 170, when several lands were disjoined from, and
others united to, the parish.
	Extent, &c.--This district lies between the rivers Ayr and
Kill, and is about 6 miles in length by 2 in breadth, though at
one place it is completely intersected by the parish of Ochiltree.
It is bounded on the north by Tarbolton; on the cast by Mauch-
line; on the south by Ochiltree; and on the west by Coylton. The
river Ayr separates it from Tarbolton and Mauchline, and the Kill
from Coylton, throughout the greater part of its boundary in that
direction. The surface partakes of the undulating character of
the adjoining district, and the soil, that of some small valleys along
the sides of the rivers excepted, is a stif clay, with a very reten-
tive bottom.
	Hydrography.--There is only one loch in the parish, and that but
of small extent. Springs are not numerous, but a sufficient sup-
ply of water is found generally at no great depth.
	Geology and Mineralogy.--Tbe banks of the river Ayr consist,
nearly throughout their whole extent, of red sandstone. Free-
stone of a yellowish colour is found near the centre of the parish;
