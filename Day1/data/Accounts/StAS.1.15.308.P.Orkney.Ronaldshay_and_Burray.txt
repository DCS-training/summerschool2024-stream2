   Valued Rent, Stock, etc.-The valued rent of South Ron-
aldsay, Burray, and Swinna is 3512 l. Scots.  It is extremely

money, in bear, malt, meal; in butter, oil, hogs, geese, hens,
and services.  By a rough calculation, the present yearly rent
of these parishes, including kelp, may be called 1500 l. Ster-
ling.
