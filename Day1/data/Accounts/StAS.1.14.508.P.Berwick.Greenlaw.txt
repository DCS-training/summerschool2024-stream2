   Mode of Cropping.-The same mode of cropping does not
prevail through the whole parish, but is varied according to
the soil and climate.  On lands fit for bearing wheat, the
mode of cropping followed by the principal farmers is
this:  When a field is taken up that has been pastured for
some years, they take 2 crops of oats successively; but if
it has not been pastured, and been only 1 year in hay,
they take only 1 crop of oats; then fallow it, and after
the fallow, sow wheat in the autumn, with grass feeds in
the spring:  If they do not sow grass feeds, which is some-
times the cafe, with the wheat crop, they then take a crop
of pease after the wheat; and after the pease a crop of
barley, along with which they sow the grass feeds.  On
light dry land, fit for turnips, when taken up after it has
been pastured, they take 2 crops of oats successively; but
if it has been only 1 year in hay, only 1 crop of oats,
then turnips, and after the turnips, barley with grass feeds.
Till of late, it was the general practice to take 2 crops of
hay before they laid their fields in pasture; but several
farmers have found, by repeated trials which they have
made, that it is more profitable net to cut their fields,
which they intend for pasture, but to put their sheep or
cattle upon them the year immediately after they are
fown.  And they are of opinion, that the fast 2 years
thus pastured, are fully as valuable as the 3 next following.

   Number of Horses, etc.-There are about 280 horses, of
all ages, in the parish, and 850 black cattle: the number
