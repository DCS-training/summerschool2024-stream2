     Statistical Account

   Manse.-The manse was built 1753, and has been twice
repaired within these 15 years.  In 1795, it got a thorough
repair for the third time, and is now a most excellent con-
venient house; it has very good offices, all lately repaired,
a good garden, and is beautifully situated, commanding a
most extensive view of the river Tay, and the rich grounds
below.

   Stipend.-The stipend is 11 bolls of wheat, '56 bolls of
barley, 57 bolls of oats, 2 bolls of meal, and L. 20 Sterling,
besides a good glebe, worth L. 20 Sterling per annum at
least; so that, with the house, garden, and offices, it is worth
about L. 150 per annum, taken at a medium of 10 years
back; but from an old practice, the victual part of mini-
ster's stipends is valued so low, it makes them appear much
less than they are in fact; although, were they stated as
they really are, the livings of the clergy in Scotland are in
general sufficiently moderate, and many of them much lower
than they ought to be.

   Plan for improving Ministers Stipends.-It would be a
good plan, were Government to make an offer to proprie-
tors to purchase their teinds, which, it is believed, most
would do.  This would raise a very large capital; and were
the produce put in the hands of trustees, under the direction
of the Church, to be lent out by them to the best advantage,
and to empower them to buy land if they though proper,
to be applied solely and entirely to pay the ministers sti-
pends, and to uphold the church and manse, a permanent
fund would be established immediately, to accommodate
the parishes with more becoming places of worship, to lodge
the ministers more commodiously, and also, to make many
livings much better; and might, in time, be the means of
making stipends keep pace with the value of money.  This
