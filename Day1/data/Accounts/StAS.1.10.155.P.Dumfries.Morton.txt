more clusters of houses, or as they are vulgarly called, towns,
containing from 30 to 50 inhabitants each.  Thornhill is
pleasantly situated upon a dry rising ground, half a mile E.
from the river Nith.  It is regularly built in two streets,
crossing each other at right angles.  In the middle, where
they cut one another, stands a handsome cross, or rather pil-
lar, erected by the late Duke of Queensberry.  This village
has greatly increased of late.  There were only 325 inhabi-
tants in it in the year 1779.  In 1791, they amounted to
430, which is an increase of one fourth in 12 years.  During
6 or 8 years previous to this period, its progress was as rapid,
and it still continues to go on.  The whole village belongs to
the Duke of Queensberry, who receives 5 s. 4 d. of yearly
rent for every house-stead and garden.  The villagers build
their houses entirely at their own expence.  Abundance of
free-stone is to be had in the neighbourhood, and the other
materials for building at no great distance.  All the houses,
6 or 7 excepted, consist of only one storey.  Some of them
are covered with slates, some with thin free-stones, but the
greater part with thatch.  The expence of building a house
of one storey is from 12 L. to 20 L. according to the kind of
roof and finishing.  Those of two storeys cost from 100 L. to
180 L. each.  Labourers and tradesmen find abundance of
employment in Thornhill and its neighbourhood; and those
who have horses, when not occupied in cultivating their small
farms, carry coals from Sanquhar for hire.  In this village
there are 4 fairs annually; one in February, one in May, one
in August, and one in November.  Each of them is on the
second Tuesday of the month, old stile.  At these fairs, there
are sold considerable quantities both of coarse woollen and linen
cloth, and yarn made in the neighbourhood.  A great number
of people from the country around assemble there, some to
