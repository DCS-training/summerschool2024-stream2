bridge, a communication is opened up of great utility 
to the country; as, shortening the road several miles in
going and returning from his Grace's colliery at Byre-
burnfoot; a new direction is given to the post road for
the space of 1 1 mile; by which means a long pull, from
N. to S. on the old road, is superseded; the chilling
blasts in winter on this part avoided, being the most ex-
posed situation on the road between Langholm and Long-
town; and new romantic seenes disclosed to the view of
the traveller, that mock all description.  The road lead-
ing from the E.end of the new, towards the old bridge,
is cut along the side of a steep bank covered with wood,
forming an amphitheatrc; at the S. end of which an-
other bridge, with 2 arches, is to be built the ensuing 
summer.  When the operations now carrying on in this
quarter, and further intended, are completed, which it 
is expected will be the case before Martinmas next, the
new line of road, for boldness of design, and difficulty
of execution, must astonish every passenger.  All these
works are done at the Duke's private expense, and must
cost several thousand pounds.

   Mines.-There are 2 collieries in Canoby; one at
Archerbock, let to an English gentleman of the name of
Lomax, wrought by an open level; the other at Byre-
burnfoot, in the possession of his Grace, to whose public
spirit the country is much indebted upon the head*.

in this parish, were let to the same person,upon a very long lease; one of
the conditions of which was, according to information, that a supply of 
coal, equal to the demand of the country, should be reality afforded at
all times.  The tacksman, to avoid the great expense of an  con-
fined his operations to those place, where could be wrought by
mean of an open level.  Hence the quantity of coal gotin this man-
