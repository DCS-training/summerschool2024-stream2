earth,* bursts out at different parts of the surface, in which
may be distinctly traced the process of petrifaction, as it is
commonly, though very unphilosophically, called.  Large
masses of opaque petrified moss are here formed; but the
rapid evaporation of the water, in consequence of its free ex-
posure to the sun and external air, prevents the concretion
of the calcareous earth into thoSe beautiful chrystalline forms
so much admired in the spars of Derbyshire.

   Soil.-The nature of the soil is as various as the surface
is diversified.  Along the banks of the river, the hoans and
meadows, in some places of considerable extent, are generally
of a light, but very fertile, soil, and capable of the highest
cultivation.  Wheat, though not a general crop, has been
raised on some of them with great success.  The more ele-
vated grounds, which principally occupy the lower part of
the valley, are chiefly arable, and, in favourable seasons, pro-
duce excellent crops of oats and barley.  Those on the south
side of the river are mostly of a light and dry soil, resting on
a bottom of gravel, and are peculiarly favourable for pastu-
rage.  On the north side they are, in generals better, in con-
sequence of a larger admixture of clay, both in the soil and
inferior strata.  The mountainous parts of the parish are al-
most solely appropriated to the pasturage of sheep and cattle,
and although certainly inferior in value, are supposed greatly
to exceed in extent the cultivated valley below.  The soil is
thin, wet, and spungy; and in many places covered with
large tracts of moss, from which, before the general use of
coal, the inhabitants were supplied with the greater part of
their fuel.

*From some rude experiments, it appears that the earth is
held in solution by means of an excess of fixed air or carbonic
acid, above what is requisite for neutralising quicklime into the
state of mild calcareous earth.
