     General Appendix to

on in boats thirteen feet wide, from 56 to 60 long, and draw-
ing 3 1/2 feet water.  Such boats, I am informed, navigate the
inland rivers in England, and go on the tideway of the Hum-
ber to Hull.  Upon the canals and Devon, the boats will
draw much easier if they are narrow.  But, I propose, in the
view of a junction being effected between the Forth and De-
von by locks, that all the bridges and locks upon the Devon
canals shall be made of the same size with those upon the
Forth.  So that the boats constructed for the latter may oc-
casionally ply upon the canals.
   The late season of the year absolutely prevents the making
minute or accurate surveys at present.  I have therefore
made some allowance on that account; and I slatter myself
that the estimates are near the truth.
   The account I have given of the Goodie I have from Mr
Morrison, who is well acquainted with it.  I am also beholden
to him for the levels and description of the Devon, and tract
above Sauchie, which he surveyed in the year 1765.  All the
other particulars I have examined myself, except the sound-
ings of the tideway of the Forth, which I relate upon infor-
mation.
   I have fixed no price to the land, because the gentlemen
interested are better judges of that article than I am.
   As the map of upper Forth is not yet finished, the distan-
ces of places I have given there are to be considered only as
estimated principally from a plan made of it in the year 1767,
which I have not seen since.  I therefore recommend to those
who want an exact knowledge of these distances, to measure
them upon Mr Morrison's map of that river, which he is
now making out, and will soon publish.
