   Very large vessels usually anchor in Cairston road, with-
out the small island or holm, that bounds the harbour on
the east side, where there is also very good anchorage,
greater depth of water, and more space; but there is tide
here, greater sea, and it lies more open and exposed.  The
ebb tide, with a westerly wind, makes a very rough sea
near the coast, especially at the top of spring tides, and is
called the rost.  The west coast of these parishes stretch
nearly in a straight line from north to south.  The extent
of the sea coast of these parishes is about 18 miles.

   Soil.-The soil of these parishes is various.  In some
places a black earth, mixed with sand, prevails; in other
places a stiff clay; black earth alone is found in some
places; in others, clay mixed with sand.  In the hills of
Stromness parish there is a great mixture of sand.  The
hill that rises above the village of that name, is covered
with a great number of stones and rocks of a granite kind,
which presents a very rough and barren appearence; but
when these stones and rocks are removed, the soil, although
shallow, is pretty fertile.  On the west side of the parish
of Sandwick, near the Sandy Bay, there is a good deal of
sandy soil, and an extensive rabbit-warren, which lies north-
east from the Bay.  This sandy soil has probably been
blown from the Sandy Bay, as the south-west winds are the
most violent, and it lies in the direction of these winds.
The right to the rabbits of this warren is claimed by one
heritor, and determined in the courts of law to belong to
him alone, although there are several heritors who have
arable and grass grounds here, interspersed with those of
