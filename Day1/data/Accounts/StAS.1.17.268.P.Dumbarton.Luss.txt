to plant all the vacant spaces with trees suited to the soil.
Oak woods are never entirely out of the reach of cattle, and
they ought never, therefore, to be permitted to enter them.
For 4 or 5 years, all agree they must be carefully preserved from
them; and, after that time, if they are thriving, and the stool is
sufficiently thick, the pasture in them is no object.  As to the
age at which an oak wood should be cut, there are different opi-
nions.  That there is a period, however, beyond which it should
not be permitted to grow, cannot be doubted.  After it is cut,
the most vigorous shoots are always observed to spring from
well rooted young stocks, from 3 to 6 inches in diameter.
Some of these will grow the first year from 4 even to 7 feet
in height, and near the ground will measure above half an
inch in diameter.  In proportion as the parent stocks are
older and larger, the shoots are less vigorous, and when the
stocks are 13 or 14 inches in diameter, there are either no
young shoots at all, or they are very feeble.  If the great
object, therefore, be to produce, at stated periods, a quanti-
ty of bark for the market, it must be the ruin of a copse
kept for that purpose to allow it all to grow very old.  If in
this country it exceeds much the usual period of 20 or 22
years, the bark becomes inferior in quality, and the stool will
suffer more by age, than the additional value of the timber
and bark can compensate.  In order to make any oak wood,
however, sell to advantage, it is necessary that there should
be a certain proportion of timber of different sizes, as well as
bark.  At every cutting, therefore, it is usual to leave so
many standard trees of different ages, for the benefit of future
sales.  These should always be healthy and vigorous, and
either in the outer skirts of the wood, or in vacant spaces,
where they are detached from other trees.  When left with-
out judgment in the thickest part of the wood, being depri-
