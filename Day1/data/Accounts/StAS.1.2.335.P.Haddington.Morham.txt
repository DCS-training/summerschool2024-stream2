it, and speak of it as a large and extensive structure.  It had
evidently been of such magnitude and strength, as to be the
means of raising a considerable village; for although there are
only a few houses remaining near the site of the old foundations,
yet the village had extended considerably westward; for, at
the distance of a quarter of a mile, a few cottages still remain,

   Situation, Extent, etc.-Morham is situated in the county of
East Lothian, in the presbytery of Hadington, and synod of
Lothian and Tweeddale.  It is bounded by the parish of Gar-
veld on the south, Yester on the West, Hadington on the
north, and Whittingham on the east.  It is about 3 miles
from the town of Hadington, where there is an excellent mar-

The property is almost equally divided between two heritors,
the Earl of Wemyss, (and Sir David Dalrymple) Lord Hailes.

improvement, the parish is almost wholly inclosed, and will
be entirely so in the course of a few years.  The soil, inclin-
