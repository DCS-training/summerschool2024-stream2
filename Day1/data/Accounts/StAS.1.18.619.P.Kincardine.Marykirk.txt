trees, the place is not only rendered pleasant to the eye,
but even beneficial and friendly to the health of the in-
habitants.  Several other houses have been built in the parish
since that period.  We cannot give an exact list of baptism,
as many parents are not fond of the expence of enrolling their
children's names in the list of inhabitants; and for being
married, and having a poor friend departed this life, they
think, they should rather receive some reward and compen-
sation, than pay a penalty.  The minister made out an exact
list in 1793, when the members amounted to 1481, by
which it appears that there is an increase from Mr Garden's
number in 74, of 400; and from Dr Webster's in 1755,
(which was probably nearer the truth,) of 201.
   But the state of the population will be better understood by
the following Table.
