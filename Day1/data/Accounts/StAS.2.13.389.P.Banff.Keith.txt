             Superstitions.--The parish records bear, since the establish-
          ment of Presbyterianism, that the session took up a case of witch-
          craft against a woman, upon an accusation, that, as often as
          she passed the door of the Earl's mill, the mill-clap stopped-
          There was, in the north part of the parish, a rig of uncultivated land,
          called the Gun Rig, set aside to propitiate the evil spirits; and
          tradition says, that, when the farmer, about fifty years ago, was
          about to improve it, one of his cattle fell down dead.  A stone-
          coffin containing some ashes was found in a heap of stones, which
          the present tenant removed, he having succeeded in improving the
          land, without injury to man or beast.
             Eminent Men.-This parish had the honour of. giving birth to
          Mr James Ferguson, the celebrated writer on astronomy and na-
          tural philosophy.

<TABLE=Population>                    III.-POPULATION.

                               In 1801, the population was  3284
                                  1811,                     3352
                                  1821,                     3926
                                  1891,                     4464
                                  1841,                     4458
             The villages of New Keith and Old Keith contain 1805 inha-
          bitants; Fife Keith, 579; Newmill, 448.  The Banffshire part
          of the parish contains 1349, and the Morayshire, 276.

                                   IV.-INDUSTRY.
             The people are generally employed in agriculture, and the va.
          rious trades which the cultivation of the land requires.
             On the hill of Oldmore, there is a population to the amount of
          300.  The produce of the land is not sufficient for more than three
          months maintenance of the people in the year, even when the crop
          is good; and as it often fails from frost and other causes, they
          have to depend entirely on the sale of peats, which they pre-
          pare during summer, and drive to Keith all the year round, with
          small carts and ponies-frequently a female being the driver.  The
          same, though on a somewhat less scale, may be said of Bogbain
          and the hill of Achanacy. The farms in the other parts of the
          parish vary in size, from crofts of 5 or 6 acres, to farms of 150 to
          200 acres.
            Agricultural Improvements,- Subsoil ploughing is carried on
          with doubtful success; bone manure answees weIl; and furrow-
          draining is practised both with small stones and tiles.  Crosses of
          the native breed of cattle of the country with Teeswater and short-
          horned bulls have answered well.
             Rent.--Real rent of the parish, L.6500: highest rent per acre
	  L.3, 3s.
