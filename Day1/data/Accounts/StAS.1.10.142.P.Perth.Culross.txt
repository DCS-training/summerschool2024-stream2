     Statistical Account

facture in Culross, which has now dwindled almost to no-
thing, is, however, not so much to be ascribed to the loss of
the patent, as to the cheaper mode of making girdles by the
Carron Company from the power of machinery, the more
frequent and general use of ovens, together with the prefe-
rence now pretty generally given to wheat bread in every
part of the country.  Under this article of manufactures, it
may be proper to mention the new and ingenious method of
extracting tar from coal, now commonly known by the name
of British tar, and which was first practised at Culross by the
present Earl of Dundonald; but of this and the other disco-
veries made by his Lordship in practical chemistry, and in
different branches of natural philosophy, it is to be hoped
a particular and satisfactory account will be given to the
world by his Lordship's own hand.

   Fisheries.-There are but few fish caught upon what are
strictly called the shores of Culross; but on those of Kincar-
dine, which formerly belonged to Culross, large quantities,
to a considerable value, are sometimes caught, especially her-
rings, and a small but delicate fish, called garvies.  They are
taken by a kind of fish trap, called a cruive, made of wicker
work, and composed of three different parts; first, a large
basket,of an oval form, (more strictly called the cruive), from
9 to 10 feet in length, and open at both ends, but consider-
ably wider at one end than the other; the wider end mea-
suring at the mouth 7 feet in diameters and the basket taper-
lag gradually down to the smaller end, whose aperture is not
more than 4 feet.  To this succeeds what, in the dialect of
the fishers, is called the bung, a lesser basket, nearly of the
same form with the cruive, likewise open at both ends; and
the last is the weal, about 4 1/2 feet long.  The smaller end of
the cruive is inserted into the mouth of the bung, and the small
