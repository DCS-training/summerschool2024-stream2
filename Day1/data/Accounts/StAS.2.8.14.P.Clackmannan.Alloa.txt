is now completely set at rest by Mr John Shaw of Drumlanrig.
(See Blackwood's Magazine, April 1840.)
  From the result of carefully conducted experiments made by Mr
Shaw of Drumlanrig, Drumfries-shire, and other ichthyologists, it
appears that the young fry do not proceed to the sea in the same
year they are hatched, as has generally been supposed, but that
they remain in the fresh-water over the first winter, and migrate
about the May following, or when about twelve or thirteen months
old. Of it shall be hereafter proved that they do not leave the
river for thirteen or fourteen months, it is evident that an immense
destruction of them must take place during their continuance in
the fresh-water ; a circumstance of great importance to the
fisheries.

parish, includes some not common throughout the county, and

Gyrinus natator                                 alsus            Plerophorus pentadactylus
                                      Polyommatus Artaxerxes     Abraxas grossulariata (5.)
      LEPIDOPTERA.                    Pamphila linea
Pontia brassicae                               sylvanus                HEMIPTERA.
       cardamines                     Anthrocera loti            Blatta orientalis(6.)
Vanessa urticae                       Smerinthus populi          Coccus Persicae (7.)
       polychloros                    Acherontia Atropos,(4)          mali
       C. album                       Sphinx ligustri            Aphides var (8.)


 (1.) The seven spotted lady-bird belongs to a Large family, of which fifty are already
known. All of them, both in the larva and perfect state, feed on the aphides, so mis-
chievous In gardens, and do not injure vegetable substances. Their eggs are common-
ly found in groups, on leaves where aphides abound. The lady-bird has been often
charged with being the cause of blight, when seen on the cankered spots of apple.
trees; but it is in reality the best remedy against that disease.
  (2.) The Anthonomous pomorum, (the Circullo p. of Linn.) is a we evil about a quar-
ter of an inch long, the elytra dotted in rows, and of a dusky red. Bandages of tar
applied round the stems of the trees prevent their ascent, for it is only In hot weather
that they fly from tree to tree. They destroy the buds, and prevent the blossoms
from unfolding.
  (3.) The cock-chafer, so very destructive in pasture grounds, has been rarely seen
here these several years. The larva, a whitish worm with six legs, a red head, and
strong claws, lives in the earth four years, devouring the roots of the grass. Their
increase may be prevented by employing children to take the insects in May and
Jime, before they have laid their eggs : which may be done by shaking and beating
the trees and hedges during the day. Where land is ploughed up in the spring, if
the weather be warm, hundreds of the grubs are exposed, when rooks, gulls jays, &c.
will devour them. The almost constant employment of rooks for three months.  in
the spring is to search for this sort of food.
  (4.) The death's-head moth is generally found on its natural food, the potato-plant.
