that kingdom in the year 1790, was 8418 chalders, or 12627
tons.  This trade is chiefly carried on by vessels belonging to
Ireland, which import a considerable quantity of limestone,
of an excellent quality.  The lime when burned and slacked,
is sold at 7d. per boll.  The articles imported from Ireland,
are chiefly grain, linen cloth, and hides.  Of imports from
other countries, wood and iron from Prussia and the Baltic
are the principal articles.
   The vessels belonging to the port are 33 in number, as

   Manufactories are not carried on to any great extent in this'
parish.  The principal are, those of leather, and of soft and
hard soap.  Of the former, the average number of hides tan-
ned yearly for these last four years is 3000, and from 5 to 600
dozen of calf skins.  There are three soap manufactories, but
the quantity made cannot be well ascertained.  Of retail shops
in the town of Ayr, besides a sew of inconsiderable note,
there may at present be reckoned thirty-six.  Twenty-one of
which are furnished with articles of grocery, four with hard
ware, two with saddlery, and nine with broad cloth and ha-
berdashery.  A large sugar house, built within there last 20
years, did not continue long employed, and lies waste and
useless, as it has done for several years past.  Our weavers of
all kinds, have most of their employment from Glasgow and
Paisley.  But of late there are many female children happily
engaged in the tambouring business, which they have from
the cotton manufactories.
