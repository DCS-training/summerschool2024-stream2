   In this hospital the poor are well lodged, cloathed, and
fed; the house is kept clean and well aired; the young are
instructed in the principles of religion, in reading English,
and a little writing; and are employed in such labour as is
fitted for them, as making thread lace, tambouring muffins,
setting card teeth, etc.  The old women are employed in
spinning, cleaning the house, and, as far as they can, doing
the work of the family.  Some of the old men weave, and
others are employed in such business as they can perform.
   The hospital also contains a small infirmary, where the
sick are accommodated with medical assistance, and where
operations are performed when necessary; and it has also a
number of cells for the reception of insane persons.  The 
whole is visited in rotation, and a written report signed 5
days in each week, by one of the directors, who are an-
nually appointed, and of whom 8, with the preceptor, fit
every Tuesday, for the purpose of admitting paupers to the
benefit of the charity, and other necessary purposes
