impassable bogs, and stagnant pools of brownish water, pre-
sents a prospect uniformly rugged and dreary.  At Tongue
Bay, the prospect varies.  An arm of the sea, skirted on
each side whith corn fields, inclosed pastures, and farm houses,
stretches itself 5 miles into the land.  On the west side is
Melness, an excellent situation for a fishing village, or a
woollen manufactory, either of which would be of vast ad-
vantage to this part of the country.

   Mineral Water.-The parish of Tongue abounds in mi-

   Coast and Cover.-  From Tongue Bay, the coast extends 16

to different parts of the country.  The rocks along the coast
are hollowed into caves, or formed into arches and pillars,
some of them so regular, that they seem to be the work
of art.  Uaidle-Mbor Fhraisgill, the Great Cave of Fraisgill,
extends more than half a mile under ground.  It is about
50 feet high, and 20 feet wide at the entrance, and grows
narrow by degrees, till at last a man can scarcely creep in it.
Its sides are variegated with a thousand colours, which are
lost in each other with a delicacy and softness that no art
can imitate.  Upon entering the cave, the mind is impressed
with a pleasing sort of awe, which is heightened by the so-
