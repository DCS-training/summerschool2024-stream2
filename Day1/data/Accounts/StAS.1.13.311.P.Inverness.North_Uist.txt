penny lands, if he has any grown up children to assist him,
will, by manufacturing kelp, make about L. 6 Sterling
yearly.  He was 6 cows, that is to say, as many great and
small as will be equal to 6 grown up cows.  Three of
them will probably be milch-cows.  One of their calves
will be killed, in order to have 2 of the cows coupled, a-
nother may be supposed to die by accident, or through
want, before the time it should be fit for the market, so
that this man has only one cow yearly to dispose of, for
which he may be allowed to draw L. 2, 8 s. at an average,
and which, added to the L. 6 above mentioned, will a-
mount to the sum of L. 8, 8 s.  This is his whole year-
ly income, having nothing elses that he can turn into
money.  On the other hand, this man pays L. 5, 4 s. rent,
including public burdens.  As he must keep 6 horses, he
will be under the necessity of buying one every second
year, at the average price of L. 3, 10 s. which makes L. 1,
15 s. a-year.  Though in an extraordinary good year, his
lands may supply his family with meal, yet he is for or-
dinary obliged to buy that necessary article; so that
matters are not exaggerated, when it is said, that he buys
1 boll a-year, at the average price of 17 s.  From this
statement, this tenant has only a balance of 12 s. in his
favour, for the purpose of buying all his other necessaries;
such as timber, for keeping his houses, implements of hus-
bandry, and perhaps boat, in repair; for buying iron, tar,
spades, flax, and several other articles that a tenant has oc-
casion for throuhghout the year.  This man, therefore, will
either fall in arrears to the proprietor, or become indebt-
ed to those from whom he buys his necessaries; so that if
the proprietor's chamberlain should be rigorous in taking
up the rents, and others in exacting their lawful debts,
many such would find themselves much distressed.
