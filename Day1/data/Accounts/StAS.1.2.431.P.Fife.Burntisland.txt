   In 1592, the parish growing more numerous, and, it may
be supposed, the inhabitants of the town, more wealthly, they
built a new church within the borough, asking nothing from
the heritors but their consent.  And, at the same time, as an
inducement, granted them proper seats, with certain privi-
ledges, taking the whole burden of building ang repairing up-
on themselves.  It is a stately square structure, with a pavili-

put on, what is called, the poors roll, get from 6 d. to is a week.
Their support must be small, considering from whence it ari-
