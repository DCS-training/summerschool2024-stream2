   Soil.-In some places, especially, near the Tay, the soil is
a strong rich clay; in others, it is light and gravelly; and in
others, good loam.  Every sort of soil in the parish has
been much improved by the use of lime, and the practice of
summer fallowing On the richer lands, are raised good
crops of wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans, flax, grass,
cabbages, potatoes and turnip.  The lighter lands are not
supposed to be so well suited to the culture of wheat; but
they afford all the other productions which have been men-
tioned.

   Climate.-From the high situation of this parish, relatively
to the grounds on the opposite side of the Tay, it might per-
haps be expected, that the cold should be more sensibly felt
here, than in the vicinity; yet this is not the case, except
perhaps on the higher grounds, towards the eastern bounda-
ry.  The greater part of the parish has a fine south-western
exposure; the higher grounds shelter the lower; and several
plantations on the north and east, afford a considerable shel-
ter to almost the whole.
   That chain of hills, which shelter the Carse of Gowrie,
and which, on the north side, reach within a thort space of
the south border of this parish, serves as a barrier to those
mists, which, coming up the Tay from the sea, frequently
spread themselves over a great part of the neighbouring pa-
rishes; the same hills attract those vapours, which are ex-
haled from the surface of the earth, in the south-east part of
the parish; the current of air, produced by the running of
the Tay, is the cause of a similar effect, all along the west
border; and the natural inequality of the surface, in most
places, together with the drains which have been made, car-
ry off both the water which arises from springs, and that
which falls down in showers.
