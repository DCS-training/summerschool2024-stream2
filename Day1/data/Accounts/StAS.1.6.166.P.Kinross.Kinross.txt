low the town, and North Quiech at the N. boundary.  All
these discharge themselves into Lochleven; and are stored with
small trout, that afford fine amusement to anglers.
   Lochleven, a magnificent and beautiful piece of water,
bounded by the hills called the Lomonds on the E. and Benar-
ty on the S. and by the plain of Kinross on the N. and W. is
about 12 miles in circumference, setting aside the angular jut-
tings, and 4 miles in length, from the W. end of the town to
the E. at the Gulet bridge*.  Several islands are dispersed in
this fine collection of water; the most remarkable is that dis-
tinguished by the captivity of Queen Mary Stewart.  The fish
of the loch have been so well described by Pennant and others,
that it seems unnecessary to say much about them here.  The
following observations, however, may not be unworthy the
attention of the curious.  The high flavour and bright red colour
of the trout, seem evidently to arise from the food which na-
ture has provided for them, in the loch.  A considerable part
of the bottom is oozy and spongy, from which aquatic herbs
spring up in abundance; and, so vigorous are they in many
parts, as towards the beginning of autumn, to cover the sur-
face with their flowers.  The trout, especially of size, lie
much in that sort of bottom.  Gentlemen, accustomed to make
observations when angling, know well, that even in clear run-
ning rivers, where their course takes a direction through a long
tract of meadow, or of oozy ground, the trout that lie or feed
in that ground, if of size, are generally less or more of a pink
colour in the flesh; while those that feed in the stony or gra-
velly soil, above or below the swampy meadows, are all white,
excepting the mixture that is sometimes made by floods.  But
