     of Lessudden or St Boswells.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are in this parish 102
horses, and 279 black cattle.  Of the latter, 90 are milch
cows.  The number of sheep cannot be exactly ascertained,
as it varies in different years, according as the proprietors and
farmers find it convenient to keep them.
   The Tweed, which runs close by Lessudden, in addition to
the beauty and pleasantness which it gives to the country, is
likewise productive of advantages.  Between this place and
Berwick, is a distance of more than 30 miles; and yet not
only here, but much higher up the water, fine and large sal-
mon are caught in the season, and sold in the country at the
moderate price of from 2 d. to 3 d. per lib.; but the greatest
part is bought up by people who find it their interest to car-
ry them elsewhere.  Salmon of 28 lib. weight have been
caught; but from 6 to 18 lib. is the ordinary weight of
those taken hereabouts; so that, at the proper times, the
neighbourhood is seldom at a loss for a small salmon, which
proves a great conveniency to families, and contributes to the
bettering of the circumstances of those concerned in the fish-
ing.
