   No register of burials is kept in this parish; and therefore,
no calculation, to be depended upon, can be made, with re-
gard to the proportion of deaths to births.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-There are several persons, both in
the town and country, above 80 years of age, but none so old
as 90.  The climate does not appear to be very favourable to
longevity.  Owing to the elevated situation of the country,
and its vicinity to the western ocean, we have frequent rains
and storms; and the air contains a greater degree of moisture,
than in places removed to a considerable distance from the
Atlantic.  There is frequently a good deal of sickness in the
village.  The diseases most common are fevers and consump-
tions: the croup* and small pox sometimes prove very fatal to
children.  The people, in general are averse to inoculation.
No remarkable instance of longevity is known to have occurred
amongst those who have resided in the parish.  A native, how-
ever, of this place, named Matthew Tait, died upon the 19th
