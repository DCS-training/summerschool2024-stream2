     NUMBER XXXIV.

     PARISH OF DRYMEN.

     (County of Stirling-Presbytery of Dumbarton-Synod of
     Glasgow and Ayr.)

     By the Rev. Mr. DUNCAN MACFARLAN,
     Minister of that Parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE name, Drumen, or, as it is more commonly writ-
ten, Drymen, is obviously derived from the Celtic
word, Druim, corresponding to the Latin Dorsum, a ridge
or eminence.  It is peculiarly descriptive of the appear-
ance of considerable part of the parish, which is frequent- 
ly intersected by deep ravines, or water courses, with rising
grounds between them.  The same word is also to be met with,
as a component part in the names of many places, as Drum-
quhastle, Drumdash, Drumliagart, etc.  The etymology of
these, and almost all the other names in the parish, is purely
Celtic.
