embankments, which bad been erected a few years before, (some of
which withstood, while others yielded to the impetuosity of the tor-
rent,) the whole crop on the most valuable lands in the parish must
have been completely destroyed.  A great part of the haugh-land is
now protected by embankments, on the lands of Fintray and Wester
Fintray, extending to upwards of 6000 ells in length, and pro-
tecting from 200 to 300 Scotch acres of very fine rich land, from
the river floods.
   Parochial Registers.-The oldest record belonging to the kirk-
session begins on 25th May 1662; but only fragments thereof
remain, scarcely legible, and all in loose sheets.  With the ex-
ception of the register of baptisms, which appears to be pretty com-
plete since the year 1728, the registers of this parish are rather
defective.  Minutes appear to have been kept, but seldom en-
tered in a bound book, previously to the year 1795-since which
time regular records have been kept.

        	In 1790 the population	was 920
	           1811, by the census,   892
	           1821,     .     .      996
	           1831,     .     .     1046-viz. 519 males, 527 females.
	           1839,     .     .     1012

The decrease between 1790 and 1811 seems to have been owing
to two or more small farms having been occasionally thrown into
one.
   The average number of births in this parsh for the last seven
years is 26 per annum; of deaths, 13; of marriages, 13.  The
number of families, by census of 1831 was 225; inhabited houses,
215 ; fatuous persons, 2.
   Number of illegitimate births during the last three years 6.
   Character, &c. of the People.-The people, in general, are ac-
tive and industrious and, with a very few exceptions, they are tem-
perate.  They enjoy, in a moderate degree, the comforts and ad-
vantages of society.

for employment and subsistence on agricultural concerns.  The

pease, bay, potates, and turnip, of which latter crop a very con-
