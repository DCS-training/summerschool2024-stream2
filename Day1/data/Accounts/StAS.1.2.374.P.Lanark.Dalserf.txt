ticularly plumbs, produced in the gardens and orchards a-
round it.  It was formerly the principal village in the parish,
but is now fallen much into decay; because the present pro-
prietor does not consider it an advantage, to have a village near
the feat of the family; and therefore does not encourage the
increase of it, by granting either leases or seus, the houses be-

may easily be removed.
   There are other two villages, viz. Millheugh and Larkhall,
both at the western extremity of the parish, and not far distant
from each other; Millheugh being situated in a narrow valley
by the side of the river Avon, and Larkhall, upon the great
road leading from Glasgow to Carlisle.  The last is now be-
come the largest village in the district, though formerly the
most inconsiderable.  The greatest part of it has been built
within these 15 years, upon leases of 99 years, and laid out
upon a regular plan.  It consists of about 100 houses, inhabi-

continence, are frequently reported to occur.  The principal
causes, which have promoted the increase of this village, are,
1st, Its nearness to coal; 2dly, Its being situated on a public
road; and 3dly, The encouragement given to persons to settle
in it, from the long leases already mentioned, by which they
obtain a permanent residence.

live temperately,and are employed in the open air.  Many of
them have arrived at a considerable age, and there are some a-
bove 80 now living.-The most general course of the
