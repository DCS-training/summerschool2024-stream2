   Poor.-The average amount of collections for the poor, from the
year 1653 to 1758, inclusive, was about 2s 10d. per week.  In 
the year 1760, when the present incumbent was settled, there
was only about L.83 laid out at interest.  The collections have
since increased considerably, and, for some years path, have
been, at a medium, 12s weekly.-Some years ago, the
funds received, from Alexander Arbuthnot, Esq. Commissi-
oner of the customs at Edinburgh, and addition of L.100, and
lately, from a proprietor of this parish, L. 50.  These sums,
together with former savings, amount now to L. 200, pro-
perly secured at an interest of 5 per cent.
