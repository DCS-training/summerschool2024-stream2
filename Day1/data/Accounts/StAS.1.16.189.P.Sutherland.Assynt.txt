standing that such in general is the climate here, yet there
is a considerable difference betwixt the heaviness of showers
and other yearly storms falling on the heights, in compari-
son of those which fall on the lower parts of the parish,
called Fa-un-Assint; in the last neither showers of rain, nor
storms of snow are so violent; whereas on the heights they
are often felt severely: In short, some winter seasons pass
near the shore, with little or no snow, but only intense frost;
while at the same time, the farthest inland end of Slish-
a-chilish, and the whole heights of this parish, groan under
a load of both.  But though the climate be thus rainy,
and the air moist during deluges such as have been descri-
bed, yet upon ceasing of the rain, a smart easterly wind
arising, and continuing for the space of 24 hours, will per-
fectly abate the waters, carry off all superfluous rain from
the surface, and moisture from the air.  That the weather
here is very changeable cannot be denied; sometimes very
serene and pleasant, but oftener the reverse, which is
the state of all places in such northern latitudes, abound-
ing with lofty hills, as this parish does.  However, that the
air here is healthful will easily be admitted, as it is a fact
well known, that people from South Britain, and from the
Isle of Man, have lived comfortably here; and, at this
very time, natives of the East and West Indies reside in
this parish, enjoying perfect health, acquiring a habit and
constitution of body almost equally robust as that of the
natives.
   There are at present here the same diseases which pervade
other places, such as chincough, measles, and small-pox.  Ino-
culation is not yet universally introduced, on account of
vulgar prejudice.  Among the numerous inhabitants who
dwell along Slish-a-chi-lish and Row-store, to Inverkirk-
ag river, fevers and diarrhoas sometimes prevail, owing,
as is said, to cold fishing seasons.  In the 1768, there
