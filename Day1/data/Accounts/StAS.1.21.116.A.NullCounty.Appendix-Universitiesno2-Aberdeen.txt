founded on very narrow and inadequate observation.  Onto-
logy, which explained there terms and distinctions, and laid
down these principles, was therefore introduced immediately
after logic.  By these two, the student was sufficiently prepar-
ed for the verbal, or at best, ideal inquiries of the other parts.
But philosophy has since that time been happily reformed
and is become an image, not of human fancies and conceits,
but of the reality of nature, and truth of things.  The only
basis of philosophy is now acknowledged to be, an accurate
and extensive history of nature, exhibiting an exact view of
the various phenomena, for which philosophy is to account,
and on which it is to found its reasonings.  This being the
reformed state of philosophy, great inconveniences must be
found in prosecuting the scholastic order of the sciences.  The
student must make a transition at once from words and lan-
guages to philosophy, without being previously introduced to
the knowledge of facts, the role foundation of, and prepara-
tion for it; he must be hurried at the first into the most ab-
struse, difficult, and subtle parts of it; he must be put upon
examining the nature, foundation, and different kinds of evi-
dence and reasoning, before he is acquainted with any speci-
mens of these kinds, by which they may be illustrated; and
in proportion as philosophy is more improved and more tho-
roughly reformed, such inconveniences must become more
sensible.  For these reasons the professors off the Marischal
College were induced to alter the hitherto received order of
teaching philosophy; and after the most mature deliberation,
they resolved that their students should, after being instructed
in languages and classical learning, be made acquainted
with the elements of history, natural and civil, of geography,
and chronology, accompanied with the elements of mathe-
matics; that they should then proceed to natural philosophy,
and last of all to morals, politics, logic, and metaphysics.
