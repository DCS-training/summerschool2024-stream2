   Means of Subsistence, and Wages.-The inhabitants of this
parish, upon the whole, enjoy the means of subsistence in an
equal degree with those of the same level in any other part
of the country.  The late successful exertions of the trader
and manufacturer, have, by increasing the demand for all
kinds of labour, and of course increasing their price, contri-
buted to improve the circumstances of the community in ge-
neral.  And, although the cause of this improvement does
not at present operate with the same force, yet weaving, the
price of which was the first increased, is perhaps the only
species of labour of which the wages have yet suffered any
considerable diminution.  Wrights and masons still earn from
9 s. to 10 s. 6 d. in the week; smiths from 7 s. to 10 s.; shoe-
makers from 5 s. to 10 s.; taylors from 6 s. to 8 s.; hecklers from
9 s. to 15 S.; gardeners from 8 s. to 12 s.; day-labourers from
6 s. to 7 s. in all seasons; and during the time of harvest, and of
weeding and hoeing, which, since drilled crops have become
so frequent, continue through a great part of the summer,
their earnings are still higher.  Male farm servants, and fe-
male servants, whether for house or farm, are commonly
hired by the half-year; and receive of wages, the former
from L. 3: 10 s. to L. 4. the latter from 25 s. to 40 s. exclu-
sive of their subsistence.

   Provisions.-While such is the rate of wages, and labour-
ers in general are fully employed, provisions are obtained ea-
sily, and upon the whole at a moderate price.  Oat meal,
now less used than formerly, but still a chief article of food
among the working classes, sells, on an average of seven years,
at 1 s. the peck; flour at 1 s. 4 d.; pease and barley meal at
8 d.  When oat meal is cheap, the consumption of it is to that
of flour, nearly in the proportion of two thirds, when dear,
of one half.  Two thirds of the oat meal consumed here is
