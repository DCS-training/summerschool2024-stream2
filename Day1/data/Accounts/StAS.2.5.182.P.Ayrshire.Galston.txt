there is not the slightest vestige of a castle in the modern sense of
the word, involuntarily suggests to the classical scholar the Latin
designation of Minora Castra. In the absence of evidence, there-
fore, to establish any other hypothesis, it may not improbably be
conjectured to have contained a detachment of the army stationed
on Allanton Beg.
	It is impossible to ascertain the present owners of all the coins
which have been dug up at different times within the parish of
Galston.*  Mr Brown of Lanfine is in possession of twenty-seven
silver coins which have been found on different parts of his
estate, and which bear the names of Alexander, David, and Ed-
ward.
	Parochial Registers.--The parish records are very imperfect
and mutilated previous to the date of 1692, from which time there
is a regular series of baptisms and minutes of session. The earliest
entry is dated 1568, and perhaps the most curious and interesting
record, which bears the date of 1640, is a copy of the  "Solemn
League and Covenant," with the names of the subscribers belong-
ing to Galston. The first names attached to this document are,
"Alexander Wallace, minister of Galston, Cessnock, Lockhart of
Barr, Stewart of Galston, Patrick Shaw of Sornbeg." The per-
son here subscribing "Cessnock" is elsewhere designated Sir Hugh
Campbell, who, with John Lockhart of Barr, were the principal
heritors or proprietors of land at this time.

                      III.--POPULATION.
	The following statement exhibits the population of the parish of
Galston for a period of seventy-five years:
                     In 1775, it amounted to 1013
			1790,	      	     1577

                                         females   1847
	The great cause of the increase of the population which ap-
pears in the above statement has been the rise and progress of the
cotton manufacture.
        The yearly average of births for seven years prior to 1032 was 110
                             marriages,                                 30
                             deaths,                                    89

mentioned, that this gentleman is in possession of a very interesting collection of an-
cient spear heads, battle axes, &c. commonly called Celts, as well as many other cu-
rious remains of antiquity.
