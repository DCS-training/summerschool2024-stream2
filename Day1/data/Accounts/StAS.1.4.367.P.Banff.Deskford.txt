   Roads.-There are 2 principal roads in the parish.  Like
the generality of roads in this country, they have been
formed originally by far too narrow; are not kept in pro-
per repair; and, from the nature of the soil, are very un-
comfortable to travellers, especially in winter and wet
seasons.  They are wrought in spring and autumn by
statute-labour, which the people undertake with reluctance,
and perform without care.  Perhaps it would be better
to levy the money along with the rents, and to employ
labourers, under direction of an attentive and capable over-
feer, during the summer season.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are in general
sober, industrious, and regular in behaviour.  There is
but one ale-house in the parish, and which is little fre-
quented.  Though not rich, several of them are substan-
tial in their stations.  The late unfavourable seasons, with
the consequent failure of crops, have reduced their circum-
stances in some instances.  Perhaps a total abolition of ser-
vices, and extension of their leases, and an allowance for
building neat and comfortable houses, would tend to me-
liorate their situation.  In consequence of their sobriety
and regularity, the people are procific and long-lived.  The
wife of one of the elders brought him lately 3 daughters
at one birth, who are all alive, and doing well.  There
are 3 families consisting of eight children each, and seve-
ral of 7 and of 6.  The last minister died about 10 years
ago, in the 88th year of his age; and there are now living
in the parish one woman aged 91, another 89, and a man
88.-The parish of Deskford is a spot universally admired,
