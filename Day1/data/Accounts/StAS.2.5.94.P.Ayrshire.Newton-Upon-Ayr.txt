94			AYRSHIRE.

the town is of considerable length, and about eighty feet in breadth;
but few of the houses in it can be said to be elegant. Between it
and the sea, a new town has arisen within the last thirty years, con-
sisting of three or four streets, which are regularly laid out, but are
as yet only partially built. The town, after being stationary for a
time in consequence of the ceasing of the coal-works, is now extend-
ing. Two handsome villas have been recently built by freemen
on their lands, and there is every reason to anticipate that their
number will soon be greatly increased.

			III.--POPULATION.
	At the Union, the population of the parish is supposed to have
been under 400. In 1755, it is inferred from Dr Webster's re-
port to have amounted to 581. In 1778, it had risen to 1600. In
1791, it was ascertained by an accurate survey, to amount to 1689,
of which number there were 836 males, and 853 females.
		In 1801, the population was 1724
		   1811,	            2809
		   1821,	            4027
		   1831,	            4020
	In 1831, there were 1927 males, and 2093 females.
	The increase in the population between 1755 and 1778 was
chiefly owing to an extensive herring-fishery, then carried on along
this coast, particularly near the mouth of the Ayr. For some years
after 1778, the number rather decreased, in consequence of the
suspension of the coal-works. But on their being resumed in 1786,
the population steadily increased, and between 1801 and 1821
was more than doubled. After this last mentioned date, from the
ceasing of the coal-works, and the removal of those employed in
them to the neighbouring parishes, the number of inhabitants re-
mained for a considerable time nearly stationary, and it is only
very recently they have again begun to increase.

interred in the grave-yards in Ayr and Wallacetown.
