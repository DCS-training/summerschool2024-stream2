August.  They are taken within half a mile of the shore,
in from 20 to 30 fathoms water, with a common hand-line
of half a crown value.  One man will sometimes catch fif-
teen score in a day.  They yield a great deal of oil; and
when cured and smoaked, are thought to resemble kipper.
Their value, per hundred, may amount, at an average, to
5 s.  There are in this fishery about 24 boats employed,
with 4 or 5 men in each.  When the dog-fishing fails,
which sometimes happens, the people are in the utmost dis-
tress for want of oil; which then rises from 6 d. or 8 d. per
Scotch pint, to 1 s. or even 1 s. 6 d.  During the rest of
the year, they seldom catch any thing but a small fish call-
ed keiths or sillocks.  These fish smoaked, together with
the sillocks, constitute a great part of the food of the inha-
bitants.
   Scalpa Flow abounds with many other kinds of fish,
such as scate, flounders, haddocks, mackrel, and occasionally
herrings.  But the inhabitants are so much employed in
making of kelp, which is the great article of Orkney com-
merce, that they have not leisure to attend to this fishery.
The common kinds of shell-fish are also to be found here,
such as lobsters, partans, spouts and cockles; there are like-
wise a few seals, and otters, whose skins are valuable.
Sometimes, too, the small whales, called the bottle-nosed,
make their appearance on this coast, and when embayed,
are surrounded with boats, and forced on shore.
   There are no fewer than fifteen smacks employed through-
out the season, in fishing and carrying lobsters to the Lon-
don market, all of which rendezvous in one or other of
the harbours of Scalpa Flow.  This fishery is considered as
very beneficial to the inhabitants of the adjacent coast, who
are chiefly employed in catching the lobsters, and receive
from 1 d. to 1 1/2 d. per piece.  The boats fitted out for this
purpose measure 12 feet of keel, and together with the nets,
