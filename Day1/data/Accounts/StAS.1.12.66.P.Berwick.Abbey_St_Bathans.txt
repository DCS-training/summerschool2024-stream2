chapel.  Trois Fontaines was also a cell of South Berwick;
but I have not been able to find any writings relating to it, and
so can give no further account of it.

   Trees, Game, etc.-On the lands of Abbay and farms ad-
joining, grow naturally the oak, the mountain-ash, the hazel,
the birch tree, besides other trees; the honey-suckle, the a-
nise, the rasp, the juniper, the brier, and bramble, etc.  On
the lands are plenty of moorfowl, partridge, gray plover,
hares, rabbits, etc.

   Country Seat.-I beg leave to add, that about a mile east
from the village of Abbay, is a country seat of the Earl of
Wemyss, called the Retreat.  It was built by his Lordship about
12 years ago, upon his estate of Blackerstone, and though
not within the bounds of this parish, deserves to be taken no-
tice of in the statistical account of it, as it tends very much
to beautify this part of the country.  The house is of a cir-
cular form, and built after a new and singular plan: as the
elegant simplicity of the architecture, the neatness and con-
venience of the different apartments, and the manner in which
the grounds around it are laid out, do great credit to the taste
of the proprietor; so its retired situation on the banks of the
Whitadder, in the heart of a mountainous country, together
with natural wood, and the extensive plantations with which
it is surrounded, render it a truly delightful and romantic re-
treat.
