   Mineral Springs, etc.-There is only one mineral spring,
which is near Rosehall, and rises within a few paces of the
Kyle.  It is impregnated with sulphur or iron, and it has been
but little used, as it smells rank.  There are traces of an iron
work having been carried on in the hill immediately above
it; and in the burn or rivulet above it, there is a vein of
manganese.  This vein, as far as yet discovered, is but small,
but said to be of an excellent quality.  Some of it has been
examined by persons skilled in those matters.

   Hills.-The whole parish is hilly.-A ridge of hills runs
parallel to the Kyle, except where it is intercepted by rivers.
The highest hill is in the western extremity of the parish, cal-
led Beinmore Assint, one part of which is in the parish of
Criech, and the other side in the parish of Assint.  Its tides
are covered with grass and dairies.  In some places it is very
rocky, but affords excellent pasture for sheep, all the year
round, except in winter.

   Woods.-There is a great quantity of natural wood in this
parish, consisting chiefly of oak and birch; but there is every
probability, that there was much more formerly.  Several
oak woods have been cut down within these 30 years, some
of them about ten years ago, and have yielded a large quan-
tity of excellent bark.  Some old oak woods have been cut
down, and no under-growths have sprung up in their stead
but several young woods have been cut lately, and are growing
again and in a thriving state.  There are also considerable
plantations of firs in different parts of the parish.  The largest
is at Rosehall, facing the S., of great extent, and in a very
thriving condition.

   Moss.-There is a great quantity of moss in the different
hills and moors, much of it of excellent quality; and the
