   It was with infinite pleasure I observed an attention paid
to cleanliness, neatness, and propriety in their houses,
which, in the lower ranks in society, is an unequivocal
proof of a regard to sentiment and to character.  They
were generally well furnished, and accommodated with
those conveniencies which, in former ages, would have
been deemed luxury.  An air of satisfaction and of con-
tentment was in general diffused over all; and the heart
of every philanthropist and good man, must have rejoiced in
beholding a share of the increasing prosperity and wealth
of the country falling to the lot of a numerous and de-
serving class of men.  And this reflection inevitably strikes
the mind, that no change or revolution in the systems of
government, could ever render the situation of the labour-
ing class of society (and which in every change must exist),
more comfortable or more happy.
