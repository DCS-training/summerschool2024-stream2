stances of the parish, the alleged diminution cannot be suppos-
ed to have taken place. In 1801 the population was 248. In
that and the following year, one-half of the parish was let in
farms of a larger-size, and a superior mode of husbandry was in-
troduced. The consequence was, that the population, by the
census of 1811, was found to have risen to 352, being an in-
crease of nearly one-third in ten years. The population dimi-
nished in 1821 to 345, and in 1831 to 326. But, as nine-tenths
of the inhabitants are farm or house-servants, and liable to be re-
moved every year, and as there is still the same number of inhabit-
ed houses, this trifling diminution may be regarded as accidental,
and not likely to be permanent.

The greater part of the population of this parish is extremely
fluctuating. All the families, with the exception of nine, being the
families either of farm-servants, or of tradesmen employed by the
farmers, are liable to be removed every year. From this circum-
stance nothing can be said respecting the general character of the
inhabitants.
