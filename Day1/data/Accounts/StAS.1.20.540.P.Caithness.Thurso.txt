yards long, and half that breadth.  Its height is supposed
to be about 400 feet above the surface of the sea.  It is
well worth the visiting, particularly in the months of May,
June, and July, when it is frequented by immense flocks of
sea fowl, chiefly gulls, cormorants, and marrots, which come
there to nestle.  The marrots range themselves in regular
lines on the shelves of the rock, and being rather a silly
unsuspecting bird, they frequehntly fall in dozens to the shot
of the cruel sportsman, who reaps no other advantage from
his prey, except the savage pleasure of destroying it.  These
birds have an excellent plumage, and their feathers might
be turned to good account; but as yet no attempts to that
effects have been made.  Their flesh is eat only by the fi-
shermen, who indeed value it so much, that, with a toler-
able marksman, they will pass a day at the Clett shooting,
without asking any other consideration for their trouble.
