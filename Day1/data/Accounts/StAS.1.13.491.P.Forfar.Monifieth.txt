at the villages of Monifieth and the East Ferry; and of
which about 6000 bolls of Winchester measure may be an-
nually used in this parish as a manure.  The crops in the
lower part of the parish are very liberal; but those in the
upper part are less productive.  The time of sowing and
reaping in the lower part, is much the same as in the east
of the Carse of Gowrie, or the centre of Strathmore; but
in the upper part is latter.  Though a considerable quan- 
tity of grain be yearly exported from the villages of Mo-
nifieth and the East Ferry, yet its price is regulated by
the market at Dundee.

   Cattle.-Besides a considerable number of cattle fed on
common pasture, there are between 300 and 400 fastened
every summer in grass enclosures, and about a fifth part of
that number fattened by turnips in winter.  A few sheep
pasture part of the links.
   Within the last 50 years, the agriculture of the parish
has been much improved.  It ought not to be omitted,
that this was entirely owing to Mr Hunter, then proprie-
tor of Grange, a gentleman whose name deserves to be re-
corded.  Some years before 1750, he, first of this parish, be-
gan to enclose land, and between the years 1750 and 1752,
to use lime as a manure.  In the year 1753, he introduced
the culture of turnips, and in the year following, that of
potatoes.  By fallow, dung and lime he prepared his grounds
for the crop, and he sowed them at the proper season with
grass-seeds.  Now had his fields begun to assume a fairer
surface and a softer mould; but still their upleasing form
remained.  The ridges were wide at one end, narrow at
the other, and bent in various curvatures.  They were
soon rendered regular and straight.  His fields lay beside
the road to the parish-church, and the parishioners, as they
passed, beheld their beauty and fertility with wonder.
