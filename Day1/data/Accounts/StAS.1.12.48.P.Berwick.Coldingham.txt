it has turned out much to their advantage, for great numbers
of them were employed all the summer time in digging and
preparing peats and turfs; but after they were, in a great
measure, restricted from that servitude, they found more
profitable employment, from the spirit of improvements which
had become general, and were soon able to get coals for their
fuel: and they are now in a more thriving condition in
every respect, than they enjoyed before the division; for,
since that period, they have not only built a good many new
houses, which they have covered with tiles, and some with
blue slates, but they have rebuilt several of the old houses

in the year 1791 the heads of families in this parish are 529;
the number of souls 2391, of whom 1136 are males, and 1255

and 20; 938 between 20 and 50; 213 between 50 and 70;
and 95 between 70 and 100.  By the session-clerk's attesta-

nuary 1793, there have been 113 baptism, 70 deaths, and
31 marriages: That the assessments laid on by the heritors,
for the paupers, have been at the rate of 4 months land-tax,
communibus annis, for these last 3 years, or 69 L. 7 s. 4 d. Ster-
