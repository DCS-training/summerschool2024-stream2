ty of Craig Lockhart, in this parish, about 1780. Although he had
no residence on the lands, he took great pleasure in adorning them,
and frequently betook himself to country occupations, as a cheer-
ing and useful recreation. He died in 1817. The property still
remains with his eldest son, and successor in the Anatomical chair.
   A small part of the lands of Colinton, containing the site of the
old house, was purchased towards the end of the last century, by
Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, Bart. Banker in Edinburgh, a man
distinguished not more by his manners and accomplishments, than
by the integrity of his character, and the enlarged benevolence of
his heart. He wrote an able and interesting life of Dr Beattie,
with whom he had been intimate for forty years. He died in 1806.
leaving for the public good his mantle on his family, who have
nobly maintained the reputation of their father. His grandson,
Professor James D. Forbes, now holds the Natural Philosophy
Chair in the University of Edinburgh, with honour to himself
and advantage to the students: and with him the parish feels ho-
noured in being connected.
   James Gillespie, founder of the hospital in Edinburgh which
bears his name, is supposed to have been a native of Roslin. He
became a tobacconist in Edinburgh; and by the exercise of pa-
tient industry and frugality, at a favourable time, he acquired con-
siderable wealth, and purchased the property of Spylaw, in this pa-
rish, where he spent the close of his days. He left the greater
part of his fortune for the endowment of a charitable school, and
of an hospital for the lodging and maintenance of old men and wo-
men. The hospital was opened in 1802. Fourteen males and
eighteen females are maintained in it, who are comfortably lodged
and fed. The free school was opened in 1803, and in it 150 boys
are instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic.
