of Doveron, called Dundabby; another called Feerward;
another called Feuer-fold; another called Dargs-fold, or
Monks-land; the haugh called Partyoke-vale; two lots of

   Church, School, Poor, etc.-A new church has been built
here this season (1794) in a situation removed from the bu-
rying ground, and of a construction more commodious for
the people, as well as ornamental to the place, than the old
church; the latter, 120 feet by 18.  The east end of it, in-
cluding the quire, chancel, and vestry, bears some marks of
antiquity, and was formerly divided from the rest of the
building by a row of ballisters.
   Since the admission of Mr William Stuart, the present in-
cumbent, in 1767, the manse and office-houses have been all
rebuilt; and are at present in good repair.
   The living, exclusive of the glebe, is 50 L. in money, and
80 bolls of meal and bear.
