have for the continuance of national and domestic prosperity.
Take away from the mass of the community the fear of God, the
belief of a future judgement, and reverence forthe Scriptures of
truth, and what is proudly called "the majesty of the law" will
prove but a feeble restraint on the fierce and unruly passions of
the human he`rt.  Diffuse the knowledge of pure religion, let its
healing virtue descend on the dwellings of the rich, and the
humbler habitations of the poor, and to the higher spiritual bles-
sings of which it shall be productive, there shall be added the con-
tentment, the peacefulness, the temporal prosperity which are its
natural fruits, and in the good providence of God its gracious and
blissful reward.
