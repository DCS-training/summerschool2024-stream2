        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name, Boundaries, &c.--The ancient name of the parish was St
Mary's.  In some old records, it is called the Kirk of St Mary of
the Lowes, (de lacubus,) the expletive being derived from its vicinity
to two considerable lakes.  There was formerly a chapel at Deuchar,
(Du-choire, i.e. a small valley.--characteristic of its site,) and ano-
ther at Kirkhope, to which the N. E. and S. E. districts of the
present parish were attached.  They appear, however, instead of
being separate establishments, to have been subordinate to the
mother church of St Mary.  In the year 1640, the place of wor-
ship was changed to the banks of the Yarrow, which henceforth
imparted its name to the parish.  This appellation has a common
etymology with that of several other streams in the kingdom--
Garw, in the British, Garbh in the Gaelic, and Garow in the
Cornish, signifying what is rough; and being highly descriptive of
the river, whether of its rocky bed, or rapid flow.  In the foundation
charter of Selkirk Abbey, by King David in the twelfth century,
the original term is translated Garna, which was afterwards soften-
ed into Zarof, Yharrow, and Yara, before assuming its present
form.
  This parish is perhaps the most extended in the south of Scot-
land.  Its greatest length is eighteen, and breadth sixteen miles,
with an area of 111 square miles.  The figure is very irregular,
and some parts of it are almost isolated, for which no other reason
can be assigned, than that they formerly belonged to the royal
forest.  It is bounded on the N. by Traquair, Inverleithen, and
