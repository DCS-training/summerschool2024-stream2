     of Peterhead.

University.  I do not recollect above seven or eight who
have been at an University from this parish since 1763.

   Fuel.-The country part of this parish is supplied with
peat from the mosses; the town, partly with peats, and
partly with coals.  From the great prejudice in favour of
peats, the mosses are nearly exhausted, and the whole parish
will soon be obliged to make use of coals.  It will probably
be of advantage to the farmers, who employ a great part
of summer in managing and leading their peats, which
might be better employed in fallowing or driving lime and
dung to their farms.

   Thirlage.-Every species of servitude is abolished, ex-
cepting thirlage to the mills, which is universally consider-
ed as a heavy burden, and a great obstacle to improve-
ment.

   Crofters.-There are very few crofters in the parish.
Those who have large farms complain of the want of them,
from the difficulty of finding servants.

   Wages.-The wages of servants have increased very
much.  Thirty years ago, a man-servant could have been
hired for L. 2, 10 s. Sterling in the year; they are now
from L. 5 to L. 8; maid-servants were from 12 s. to 15 s.
in the half-year; they are at present from L. 1 to L. 1, 10 s.
Day-labourers were 8 d. each day in summer, without their
victuals, they are now 1 s.; masons and wrights were 1 s.
they are now 1 s. 6 d.; in harvest, reapers get 1 s. each,
besides their victuals; the wages of other tradesmen and
day-labourers are increased in the same proportion.
