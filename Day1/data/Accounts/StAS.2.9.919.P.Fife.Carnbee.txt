	  Education.-There is one parochial, one private, and one fe-
	male school. The salary of the parochial teacher is the maxi-
	mum, with house and garden, and, in addition to this, he has a
	portion of land at Over Kellie, yielding a rent of L.20. The
	number of scholars may be stated at 70.	The teacher of the fe-
	male school has a salary of L.10, and a	free house and school
	room, together with the school fees.	The number of scholars,
	35.   The teacher of the private school	depends altogether upon
	the school fees, which are inadequate for his support. There is
	also a Sabbath school.
	  Registers.-The earliest of the registers extant is of date 1650.
	They have been well kept.
	  Poor's Funds.-The only property vested in the kirk-session
	for the relief of the poor is L.320, L.100 of which was bequeathed
	to them by the Rev. Mr Thomson. A legacy of 1000 dollars
	has, within the last few months, been left to them by the late
	Joseph Pitcairn, Esq. of New York, for the same purpose. The
	interest of the above sum, the collections at the church doors,
	parish dues, and a voluntary contribution from the heritors, has
	hitherto been sufficient to relieve the wants of the ordinary and
	occasional poor, as will be seen by the following statement:
