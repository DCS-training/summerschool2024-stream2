   terranean buildings at Mudball, described in the former Accnunt
   as Pictish buildings, and which, it is remarked, answered to Ta-
   citus' description of the buildings of the Germans.  "They dig
   caves in the earth, where they lay up their grain, and live in win-
   ter." (De Mer. Germ. c. 16.) My predecessor adds with cha-
   racteristic naivetd : "If people were obliged again to creep into
   a hole, they would know the value of good government by the
   want of it." There are two of those eminences, partly artificial,
   which are generally denominated Laws,-one at Blacklaw, and
   another near the Bridge of Couttie.  Some suppose, that, in the
   olden time, these were the seats of justice, whence law, rude and
   simple as themselves, was dispensed to the lieges.  Others incline
   to the opinion, that they were used as telegraphs; and derive the
   name not from the Anglo-Saxon hlawe, (agger,) but from the Swe-
   dish loa or lue (hence our low), a flame.  The walls of the
   church are understood to be very old.  The pulpit is curious, be-
   ing carved of oak, resembling John Knox's pulpit at St Andrews,
   and evidently of the same era.  There is a monumental stone in
   the back wall of the church to the memory of Nicol Campbell of
   Keithock, (son of Donald, Abbot of Coupar, and grandson of the
   Earl of Argyle), who died 1587, aged seventy.  Another, in the
   west p`ssage, (the inscription on which will soon be obliterated),
   to David Campbell of Denhead, the brother of Nicol Campbell.
   There are two other stones on the wall of the church,-one to the
   memory of Leonard Leslie, entitled Dominus de Cupro, com-
   mendator of Coupar, who died 1605, aged eighty-one; and an-
   other representing a John Cummin of Couttie  in this parish,
   dressed in a coat of mail, and standing on a dog; the date 1606.
