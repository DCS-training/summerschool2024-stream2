   On the estate of Earl's-hall, belonging to Robert Bruce
Henderson, Esq.  Advocate, are a few old trees.  On this
estate is built one of the most extensive farm steadings in the
parish.  These two estates, once were in what is called run-
rig, two ridges belonging to Leuchars, one to Earl's-hall.
This mode of division, while it may seem to secure to each
proprietor his proportion of good and bad land, must be at-

of improvement, and exposes the labourers to no inconside-

   On the estate of Pitcullo, belonging to Neil Ferguson, Esq.
Advocate, are some very fine old timber, and several fine

farm tosts.
   On the estate of Ardit, the property of John Anstruther,
Esq. Advocate, are also to be seen some fine old trees, hedges

parish, as they rise above the flat ground on the east, afford
an agreeable and pleasing variety to the traveller, from Cupar
to St Andrews, from Cupar to Dundee, or from either of
these burghs to Cupar.
   On the estate of Drone, belonging to Robert Meldrum
Esq. of Clayton, there are more than 20 acres planted;
some 20, some 7 years old: and within these 5 or 6 years,
about 10 acres were planted with great taste, in different di-
rections, from the house of Clayton, that will greatly beautify
the situation of that building.  Here also are two excellent
farm steads.  There are 8 acres planted on the estate of Pit-
lethie, belonging to Thomas Lawson, Esq.; besides some old,
