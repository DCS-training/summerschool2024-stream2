upon the corn by weights, and turned by a very simple contrivance on the
lying shaft.

   Upon the supposition that the mill thus constructed had not sufficient velo-
city to thresh the corn perfectly clean, it was altered some time after by Mr
Mickle, also of Alloa, who added sanners, or a winnowing machine, to sepa-
rate the coin from the chaff; and multiplying wheels, which increased the
velocity so much, that with four threshers only upon the drum, if the hori-
zontal of horse-wheel went twice round in a minute, which horses can easily
do* at their usual pace, the drum will move through a space of 2496 feet,
and the corn passing through the mill will receive 832 strokes in the same
time:  But this machine requires 7 or 8 men, and 4 horses at least; even
6 or 8 horses may be put to, which makes the work much easier.  This mill
has threshed and winnowed 9 1/2 bells of wheat Linhthgow measure, = to
5 quarters 2 pecks Winchester measure, in 27 minutes but this was in 1793,
for feed, when the crop was rich, and the straw short; for it is to be observed,
that the power and execution of thrashing-mills are various according to cir-
cumstances, independent of the machine itself; such as, the richness of the
crop, and the length of the straw:  If the crop be rich, and the straw short,
the mill will thrash more in a given time; and, vice versa.  Mr Mickle also
reversed the motion of the drum, and made it give the stroke upwards instead
of downwards, as formerly, which was found to be a very great improvement,
and has been universally adopted ever since.
   Since that time, the threshing mill has been still farther improved, by add-
ing to it a rake with four wings, which is turned by a strap from the lying
axle, and moves over a concave grating, through which the corn falls into
the hopper of the fanners, while the shaker (as it is called) turns out the
straw upon a floping rack, perfectly clean, and by that means saves the labour
of two men at least.  And what is very remarkable, the most approved mills
now, after many experiments have been made, are built exactly upon the
same principles with that built by William Jaffray in 1788, with the hori-
zontal or horse wheel 16 feet in diameter, and the spear-wheel 4 1/2 feet, and
the drum from 3 to 4 feet, which is calculated to make nearly about 90 re-
volutions for once of the horse wheel.  This goes with great ease with four
horses; threshes the coin perfectly clean as far as nearly 10 bolls in the hour.
One of the best in the Carfe is lately built by William Dick, wright in Dun-
dee, at Ballendean, and farther improvements are still going on.  Very good
