     Statistical Account

this, at the entrance of the Moray frith; it has now taken
a different channel, and considerable quantities of goods are
transported by carriers to Fraserburgh, and the neighbour-
hood of that town.
   The trade with London is mostly carried on by ships be-
longing to a company at Banff, who have a few ships con-
stantly employed in bringing goods from London to Peter-
head, Fraserburgh, and Banff.  There is generally one of
these traders here every two or three weeks.  I am glad to
find the merchants in this town are to employ their own
ships in this trade.  There is a very great value of eggs,
butter, cheese, sometimes of beef and pork, exported from
this port to London.
   A great quantity of victual is exported from this har-
bour, and purchased mostly by merchants in this place,
partly on commission, and partly on speculation.
   There are many articles from the Carron Company
brought hither; likewise from the manufacturing towns of
Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham.  Goods to
a considerable amount are imported from Sunderland,
Newcastle, Hull, Leith, Glasgow, Aberdeen, etc.; and
by a lift I have seen from the waiter of the principal
Inn here, I find the number of riders and merchants on
business, who lodged there from the 16th of May 1973 to
the 16th of May 1794, was 153.  A slate of the trade
and manufactures in this town will be best known, by ex-
hibiting as accurate an account of the imports and exports
as can be obtained.
