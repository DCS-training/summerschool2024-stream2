   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people cultivate their
farms, and follow no other employment, yet improvements
are not advanced to any considerable length.  They are as
economical as their neighbours, and frugal from their cir-
cumstances.  Dress, customs and manners, are considerably
improved within these 50 years; but the people by no
means border on luxury.-The roads are but indifferent.
There are 13 bridges, generally built and kept up by the fa-

Ayr and the towns of Port Glasgow and Greenock.-
There are 6 ale-houses in the village of Kilmalcolm, and
3 about the centre of the parish.  There the country people

There are the remains of the castle of Duchal, the ancient
seat of the family of Porterfield, very romantic in its situ-
ation, and strong in its construction.  Part of it was demo-
