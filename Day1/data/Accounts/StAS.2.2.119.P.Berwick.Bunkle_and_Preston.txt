to the Rev. Edward Sandys Lumsdaine. This beautiful proper-
ty, lying along the course of the river, has been in the possession
of the family of Lumsdaine for many centuries. It still shows the
ruins of an ancient castle, near the present mansion-house.
   The lands of Billie, measuring 900 arable acres, and 20 of wood,
are the property of William Forman Home, Esq. of Billie and Pax-
ton, on which are the ruins of an old castle. The other properties
in this parish are of small extent.
   Antiquities.-Along the southern verge of the Lammermoor-
hills, immediately above the ruins of the old castle, are vestiges
of several ancient encampments, at short distances from each
other, forming a line along the southern verge of the hill, of
three or four miles extent from east to west. These camps
are for the most part of a circular form, each enclosing about
two acres of ground. Of their antiquity or origin, tradition fur-
nishes no account. Their appearance would seem to carry them
back to the times of the Picts; to an era at least anterior to the
overthrow of their kingdom, in the year of our faith 839. But to
whatever period their origin may be assigned, it appears sufficiently
obvious, that they were intended as a barrier against the incursions
of a southern foe, as they lie along the verge of the hill, at places
where the ascent from the south is more gradual and easy, and
therefore requires the strongest defence. One of the most entire
of these camps is at the head of the cleugh near Preston. It is
surrounded with a line of double ramparts or mounds of earth, with
corresponding ditches, even yet ten or twelve feet deep, leaving an
opening on the east and west sides, as gateways to the interior.

   None of the greater heritors reside at present in the parish.
Most of the tenants have neat and commodious houses, maintain
a respectable rank in society, and live comfortably. The other
inhabitants are chiefly employed in agricultural labour. Their
houses consist in general of one apartment only, which, in cases
of family affliction, are found to be extremely inconvenient. In
other respects, they enjoy a fair share of the comforts of life, and
are quite contented with their condition. Living in a district where
scarcely any manufactures are carried on, they are not given to poli-
