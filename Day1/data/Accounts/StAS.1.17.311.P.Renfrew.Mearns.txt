rocky eminence, and commanding an extensive and beauti-
ful prospect.  It is not known when it was built.  It is sup-
posed to be several hundred years old, and to have been used
as a place of defence.  It was surrounded by a strong wall,
and the entrance was secured by a draw-bridge.  It is now,
however, greatly dismantled and out of repair, the family of
Blackhall, to whom it belongs, having their residence at
Ardgowan.
   The roads are in good condition, and the best materials
are every where at hand for making them.  The great road
from Glasgow to Kilmarnock runs through the whole length
of the parish; as does also the road from Glasgow, to Stewar-
ton.  The road from Paisley to Kilbride and Hamilton
crosses the parish from north to south.  There are also ma-
ny private roads.  These were formerly made and repaired
by statute labour, but an act of Parliament is now passed, for
converting the statute labour of this county into money.
There are no discases peculiar to this parish.  Inoculation
for the small-pox is gradually gaining ground.  There is
neither free-stone, nor lime, nor coal in the parish, but all
these are to be had in plenty at no great distance.
