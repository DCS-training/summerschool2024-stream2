     NUMBER IX.

     PARISH OF GLENSHEIL.

     (County of Ross.-Presbytery of Lochcarron.-Synod of
     Glenelg.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN MACRAE.

     Origin of the Name, Situation, and Extent.

   GLENSHEIL, which is only a district of the parish of
that name, is situated between the forests of Seaforth,
the proprietor, and Glengarry, and should, it is said, be called
Glan-shelig, or valley of hunting.
   The higher part of the parish consists of two narrow glens
or valleys, extending between two or three computed miles
from the head of the well known arm of the sea called Loch-
Duich, and at the medium distance of one computed mile
and a half from each other; but the grazings occupied by
the inhabitants of these glens extend to the distance of eight
computed miles more in the same direction of south-east, by
between three and four computed miles broad.
   The lower part of the parish, called Letterfern, runs in the
direction of north-west along Loch-Duich, on the south, the
distance of six computed miles, and rises from the sea, by a
pretty rapid ascent, to the medium distance of one computed
mile and a half; so that the parish is sixteen miles long, by
between one and a half and four broad.
