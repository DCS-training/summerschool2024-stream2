gation, but it will afford a pretty accurate idea of the average va-
lue and distribution of property in the parish.  About 200 acres
are taken up with waste grounds, roads, braes, and plantings.
There is very little waste or uncultivated land.  The average va-
lue of the land per acre is from L 1, 5s. to L. 1, 10s.; in 1791, it
was 15s.  Some acres towards Dechmont and Carmunnock are not
worth so much; but about Hallside and towards the Clyde, L. 3
and L. 4 are paid for the acre.  There are about 41 farmers in the
parish at present; in 1791, the number was 50; of course the farms
must now be much larger.  If we take the amount of arable land at
4125 acres, the average size of farms will be 108 acres.  Nearly
the whole of the land is arable, and is well cultivated.  All the
ordinary kinds of grain are produced in great abundance.  The
number of acres of the different kinds of produce, with the average
value of each, at the time last report was drawn up and at the pre-
sent day, is subjoined:

   The above is a very moderate, average.  The gross produce of
coal and minerals in the parish may be worth L. 3200 more.  It
is observable that the produce has much increased during the last
forty-five years, which is chiefly owing to improved management.
Wheat is chiefly sown on the rich level fields bordering on the
Clyde.  It is raised on all soils; but the clayey, which is the most
common, is found to answer best, because the crop suffers least by
