     Statistical Account

   In the year 1401 Murdac was taken prisoner by the
English at the battle of Homelden, and detained till ex-
changed for Percy, 1411; and, on 3d September 1420, he
succeeded his father in the government; but, being of a slug-

bridge.  Isabella, Murdac's wife, being carried from Doune
Castle to the Castle of Tantallan in Lothian, the heads of
her father, husband, and children, were sent to her in the
prison, to try if, impatient of grief, she would reveal the
supposed treason; but her answer was noble and elevated:
