has been deepened by the present proprietor at different pe-
riods of time, and at very great expence.  The Fenzies
Loch has also been partially drained, and a great quantity of
marl has been taken out of it by means of boats and nets.
This loch has every where a marly bottom, and the marl is
in many places of a very great depth.  The tales of marl at
these pits have been very extensive; and the advantages de-
rived, not only to the proprietor of the marl, but also to
all the proprietors of land in this neighbourhood, and to
their tenants, have been very great.  And these advantages
would have been much greater had the proper method of
cropping lands, when they were first marled, been rightly un-
derstood.  Let it be observed, that there seems to be a natu-
ral and necessary connection betwixt spring water and shell
marl:  For, with respect to both the marl pits above nam-
ed, and all other marl-pits which the writer of this statisti-
cal account has seen, a much greater quantity of water issues
from the respective pits than the quantity that runs into
them; at least than the quantity that runs superficially into
them; and because, notwithstanding of repeated trials, this
writer has never yet seen marl found in any pit, marsh, or
lake, into which as much water is observed to run, as that
which runs out of it.  With respect to the situation of marl-
pits, let it also be observed, with respect to these in this pa-
rish, with respect to all the marl-pits in this country, and
perhaps in every other country, that the circumjacent ground
rises from the pit on all sides, excepting that one by which
the water issues from the pit.  By attending to these two
observations, a great deal of trouble may be saved in the
course of searching for marl; and marl may be easily found
in countries where it is not yet known.
   Marl, as a manure, operates chiefly upon the earth by se-
parating its parts, rendering it more penetrable to the roots
