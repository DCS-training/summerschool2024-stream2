     The Statistical Account

of attaining to this, is denied to country parishes; and has
become almost exclusively the property of residenters in
towns or large villages.  But, are the youth reared there
more virtuous than in the country?  Is the fear of God, and
a due regard to moral duties, as generally and assiduously in-
culcated in those crowded seminaries, as it was once in our
parochial schools, and would still be, were they on their an-
cient footing?
   A smattering of learning does harm.  This, however, is al-
ways frequent, in crowded seminaries, where individuals are
not closely attended to.  If it be found in country schools,
it is owing to the cheapness of teaching, or to the teacher
himself; mad the improvement proposed, or rather the
storation of our parochial schools, would serve essentially to
prevent this abuse of learning.
   Very few of the parochial schools in this district are le-
gally filled by authority of presbytery; nor is it usual, either
for victors or presbyteries, to inspect them regularly:  parents,
also, pay them little or no attention:  and it is really surpri-
sing that, under these circumstances, we have any attentive
teachers among us.  The youth (who are the spring) being
thus neglected, what is to become of the year?-Did any of
those lawgivers, who, at the distance of an hundred years
ago, made provision for the diffusing of sound learning,
without the abuse of it, and of inculcating generally, and
with effect, the principles of sacred and civil duties, now
descend to visit us, and to enquire into the event of those
wife provisions; would he not find the spirit of them gone?
He would see every thing else on an improving plan, and
all orders in society augmented; but on entering one of our
parochial schools, and enquiring after the inspection of
youth, I blush to think what sentiments he would form with
respect to this boasted age of improvement.
