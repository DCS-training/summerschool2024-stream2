     of Ancrum.

   There were formerly many malt-kilos in the village of
Ancrum.  Old people specify the number of eighteen or
twenty having been in constant occupation in the days of
their fathers; an evidence of the extent of the contraband
trade carried on by Scottish borderers previous to the
union.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people, in general, are in-
dustrious, healthy, and robust; and there have been instances
of extraordinary longevity in this as well as in neighbouring
parishes, though it is remarkable that no person now living
in it exceeds the age of seventy five.  Mr Cranstoun, the last
incumbent but one, attained to the age of eighty four, dur-
ing fifty seven years of which period, he had been minister
of the parish; and he and his son were the only Presbyte-
rian incumbents in Ancrum from the Revolution till January
1790, a fact that probably has not a parallel in any other
part of Scotland.  The late Mr Cranstoun, during the first
fifty years of his ministry, had never been rendered incapable
of performing his duty by indisposition.  Though, for the
last seven years of his life, from the increasing infirmities of
age, he found it convenient to accept of the occasional assis-
tance of his brethern; and discontinued preaching altogether
the two last, being regularly supplied by an assistant at his
own expence, yet his health was found, and his mental facul-
ties entire and vigorous.  A comprehensive understanding,

bank.  From these appearances, it is natural to conclude, that,
though these caves, so frequently found on the banks of rivers
in border counties, were originally intended for places of con-
cealment and shelter, yet, after the happy event which put an
end to interior violence and depredation, they were probably
assumed by the poorer classes for places of habitation, and im-
proved by such farther accommodations as the rude or simple
taste of the times required.
