   There is a register of baptisms and marriages, from
November 1705 to the present time, which appears to
have been regularly kept, unless, perhaps, for some
few years before and after the year 1750.  From this
register, the following numbers of baptisms and mar-
riages, in the several periods of 10 years, from the begin-
ning of the year 1710, to the beginning of 1790, have been
extracted.
