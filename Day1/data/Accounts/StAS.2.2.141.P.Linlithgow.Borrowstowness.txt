                    BORROWSTOWNNESS.                           141

   It is a remarkable circumstance, that no shore dues or wharfage
on goods are levied at this harbour; and it is much to be regret-
ted, that, during the last lease of the colliery, almost all the coals
from the Duke of Hamilton's property were shipped, not at Bo'-
ness, but at Bridgeness in Carriden. These circumstances have
proved exceedingly disadvantageous to the funds of the town. But
it is hoped, when the Act of Parliament, and the lease of the coal-
works, shall be renewed, these serious disadvantages will be
avoided.'
   Owing to the deficiency of funds, the trustees have not only
been prevented from undertaking various desirable improvements
in the town and harbour, but have also incurred a heavy debt, as
will appear from the following statement:

   The debt due by the trustees in the year 1823 was L.1769.
At one period the debt was above L.2000. At present, however,
it is less.
   The petty customs are the property of the Duke of Hamilton,
the superior.
   Port and Custom-Hauses.-More the Union, the magistrates
of royal burghs collected the greater customs belonging to the
Crown, as well as the petty customs belonging to the burghs, and
they accounted for the former to the Exchequer; but at, and
probably for some time before, the Union, the greater customs
were taken out of the hands of magistrates, and let to tacksmen,
or farmers of the revenue, as appears from the minutes of the
Commissioners of the Union. The King's duties were collected
at Blackness, for the goods imported in this district. By the
treaty of Union, the English customs laws were extended to Scot-
land, and custom-houses were then established at the principal
ports. The influence of the Hamilton family procured the Cus-
tom-House to be established at their own town of Bo'ness, instead
of Blackness, and the first ledger of the "Fort of Berrowstoun
Ness" commences on 26th December 1707. The district of this
port embraced both sides of the Frith of Forth, from Dumbrissle
Point and Craimond Water, upwards to the boundaries of Alloe.
