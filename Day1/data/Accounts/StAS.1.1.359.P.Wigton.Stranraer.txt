the town, can only be reforted to in calm settled weather;
hence the inhabitants are not so well, or so regularly supplied
with fish, as might be expected from the situation of the town.
The herring fishery shall be mentioned afterwards.  Stran-
raer has no artificial harbour.  Ships of 300 tons burden can
town.  Vessels o 60, even of 100 tons, frequently anchour
close by the houses.  At high spring tides the water rises at
the town 10 feet perpendicularly, and retires along a gently
declining, smooth, sandy beash, to about a quarter of a mile's
distance.  The anchorage is good and safe every where.  A
strong N. or N. W. wind, accompanied with a high tide,
are the only circumstances that can, in the least degree, en-
danger vessels anchoring in the road, or near the town.  The
town is divided, nearly in the middle, by a little rivulet, over
which there are several stones bridges.  The castle, now un-
inhabited, is a whin-stone building, with free-stone corners
and windows, of considerable height, and still very substan-
tial.  The handsome town-house and prison, built about
eighteen years ago, with the many new houses built within
the same time, and well finished, add greatly to the beauty of
the streets.  New houses, finished in a style that would not
disgrace even some of our richer and more populous towns,
are rising every year, and demonstrate the increasing opulence
and taste of the inhabitants.  The situation of the town is
esteemed very healthy; and the good health commonly en-
joyed by the inhabitants fully justifies this opinion.  The wa-
ter, though drawn from wells, is good; the air pure, and
free from fogs; the winters generally mild, except when the
wind blows from the N. or N. W.  The laborious part of
the inhabitants, exposed to the severity of many a winter's
storm, to rain and snow, while following their occupations at
sea, have something too much reason to complain of rheu-
