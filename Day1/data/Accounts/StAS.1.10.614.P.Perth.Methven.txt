*The Doctor's immediate predecessor, was MR WILLIAM 
MONCRIEFF, settled in 1694.  The ministers between the Re-
storation and the Revolution, were MR RAMSAY and MR OMEY ;
and, when Presbyterianism was re-established in Scotland, in
1638, Mr ROBERT MURRAY, of the family of Woodend, a small
estate in this neighbourhood, was then minister, whose son, Mr
JOHN MURRAY, succeeded him : They were both eminent in
their times.  JOHN Duke of ARGYLL'S great-grand-father's
father, in the maternal line, was brother to the above Mr Ro-
bert Murray : His name was WILLIAM MURRAY ; he was
minister of Dysart ; and there was another brother, THOMAS,
who was Preceptor to King CHARLES I.  By the interest of
the preceptor, his nephew, William, son to the minister of Dy-
sart, was educated with the young Prince, who contracted so 
great an affection for his play fellow, that he afterwards created 
him Earl of Dysart.  He married Elizabeth Bruce, of the fa-
mily of Clackmannan, by whom he had two daughters, ELI-
ZABETH, Countess of DYSART, and MARGARET,  married to
LORD MAYNARD, in England.  The Countess married SIR
LIONEL TOLLEMACHE of Helingham, in the county of Suf-
folk, by whom she had LIONEL, EARL OF DYSART, and another
son ; also two daughters, Elizabeth and Catharine.  Elizabeth
married ARCHIBALD, first Duke of ARGYLL, by whom she had
JOHN, the great Duke, the Earl of ISLAY, and ANNE, married
to JAMES 2 d Earl of BUTE, and mother to JOHN, the late Earl.
Catharine, the other daughter, was married, 1st, to JAMES
LORD DOWN, son and heir of ALEXANDER Earl of MURRAY,
and next to JOHN  Earl of SUTHERLAND.  The Countess, after 
SIR LIONEL'S death, married the great Duke of LAUDERDALE.
Thus the little family of WOODEND, soon connected itself with
some of the best families in both kingdoms.
