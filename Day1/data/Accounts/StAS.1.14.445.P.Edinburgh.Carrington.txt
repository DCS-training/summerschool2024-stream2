     Of Primrose.

the rivers, which roll their migthy waters through the
nations, the fail of commerce has been almost never seen.
The surface of the earth is strewed, and its bowels are
impreganated, with the rude materials of useful manufac-
tures, which the hand of skill has never touched.  Man
seems more eager to desolate and destroy, than to produce
and cultivate.  When shall the happy period arrive, at
which ruin and carnage shall crease for ever, and all the
sons of men shall place their glory in intimating the charac-
ter of the Supreme Universal Father, who delights to cre-
ate, to improve, and to facilitate?
