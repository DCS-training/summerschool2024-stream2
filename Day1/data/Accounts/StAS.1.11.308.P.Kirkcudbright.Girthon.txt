     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF GIRTHON.

     (County and Presbytery of Kirkcudbright-Synod of Galloway.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM THORNBURN.

     Situation and Extent.

   GIRTHON lies about 6 miles N. W. of the burgh of
Kirkcudbright.  It no where assumes a regular figure.
The extent from N. to S. is about 20 miles; and the breadth,
from E. to W., from 3 to 5.

   Soil and Surface.-These are extremely varied.  For
about 10 miles from its northern, and all along its eastern
boundary, it is bleak, unequal, hilly, and covered with heath.
For 10 miles to the S., within a mile of the Fleet, it presents
a beautiful level surface, which yields grain and grass of an
excellent quality.  Except the extensive wood of Castramont,
there is little natural wood; though the soil seems highly
favourable for rearing trees of every species.
