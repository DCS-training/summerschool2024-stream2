but are raised in considerable quantities on the dryfield part of
the parish.
   Produce.--The following may be considered a pretty fair calcu-
lation of the produce of the Kerse :

half of which is pasture, as follows;-

   The hill-ground, always in pasture, extends to about 5000 acres,
grazing about 4000 sheep, which, reckoned at 4s. per sheep, gives
the gross produce of this part of the parish at L.800. According
to this calculation, the gross produce of the land in pasture, or in
cultivation, amounts to L.23,088, 17s. 6d. which may probably be
considered a pretty near approximation to the truth.
   Manufactures.-There is a woollen manifactory in the village
of Menstrie, employing about fifty hands; distillery at Dolls,
mear Menstrie; a paper-manufactory near Bridge of Allan; and
it spinning-mill lately-established in the same neighbourhood.  All
appear to be under good management; and I am not aware that
any of them are injurious to the morals or health of the people.

    Market-Town.--There is no market-town in this parish.  The

parish, and Alloa, about three miles from its eastern extremity.
    Villages.-There are five villages in the parish of Logie, be-
sides smaller hamlets. Menstrie, the largest, contains near 500
