opposite side of this bay.  At the port of Wigton, they
cost, according to their different qualities, from 1 s. 4 d.
to 1 s. 6 d. the ton, which consists of 21 bushels; and
from 20 to 25 tons are laid on an acre.  The lime comes
from England: the Carlisle bushel, which is equal to 3
Winchesters, costs 1 s. 2 d. at the port; and from 40 to 50
of these are allowed to an acre.

   Utensils.-Thirty-four ploughs, 60 pair of harrows, and
66 carts, are at present employed within this parish, for
the purposes of agriculture.  Several improvements have
been introduced into the use of these instruments.  The
plough, which formerly employed 2 men and 4 horses,
is now managed by 1 man, and drawn by 2 horses;
though, in breaking up stiff ground, 3 horses, and even
sometimes 4, together with a driver, are still employed.
Over all the hard land in the parish, the common Scotch
plough is used, which agrees best with the nature of the
soil, it being in general very stony; but the English plough
is used in the soft land.  A pair of harrows are drawn by
2 horses, or, when made lighter on purpose, sometimes
by 1; the old timber tines, by which the ground was
exceedingly ill harrowed, are exchanged for those of iron;
and the harrows themselves, which were formerly loose,
and constantly interfering, are now coupled together.  It
is not above 40 years since carts were introduced into this
parish.  The double horse carts, which prevailed for some
time, are now generally laid aside; and single horse carts,
the preference of which is universally seen, are substituted
in their place.

   Crops.-While the land was in its natural state, oats
were almost the only, as they still are the principal crop,
