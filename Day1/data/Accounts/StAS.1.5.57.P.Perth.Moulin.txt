harvest is extremely variable, beginning sometimes the end
of August, and sometimes not till the 10th of October.  The
parish supplies itself with provisions, except an inconsider-
able quantity of oat-meal imported from the low country,
but, which is not equal to the tenth part, of what used to be 
imported 20 or 25 years ago, before potatoes were so ge-
nerally cultivated.  The quantity of bear, sold in the pa-
rish to whisky distillers, is probably greater than the quan-
tity of meal imported; so that the quantity of grain, raised
in the parish, is greater than the quantity of meal consumed

of that kind imported.  Considerable quantities of marl
have been found indifferent parts of the parish, which have
been used in farming by some gentlemen, but rarely by
the tenants.

   Implements of Husbandry.-The number of ploughs in
the parish is 141, belonging to tenants, and 5 belonging to
gentlemen.  The ploughs are rather small and clumsy,
drawn by four horse yoked a-breast, and driven by a man,
who holds the horses by the halters, and walks backwards.
The gentlemen, and two or three tenants, make use of
two-horse ploughs, driven by the man who holds the
plough.  No waggons.  A farmer, of the superior order,
has usually two pair of pretty good cart wheels, 40 or 42
inches in diameter, and two bodies of carts fit for any ordi-
nary kind of load; also two pairs of slighter wheels, em-
ployed only in carrying fuel, or dung to the field.  He has
four cart bodies, made of close boards, for carrying dung;
and as many for carrying peat, made with a light open
frame interwoven with twigs.  The whole number of cart-
