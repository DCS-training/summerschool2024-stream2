tal of these acres L. 3828 Sterling; the average is L. 1, 9s. 6 1/4d.

except at Barr-hill. The best land in the parish is at Shirva.
Oats, barley, hay from sown grasses, flax, pease, beans, and a small
proportion of wheat, are the principal crops sown. The usual ro-
tation of crops in dry lands is for the first year a white crop; for
the second year a green crop; on the third year the land is sown
down, partly with wheat, barley, or oats, and in the fifth and sixth
years it is allowed to lie in pasture. In wet lands, generally two
white crops are taken, or one of them in flax, which is chiefly
sown towards the east end of the parish. The other crops are as
above. In the third year, some farmers sow down with barley and
rye-grass; and where that does not answer, they plant potatoes; in
the fourth year, there is a hay-crop, and the fifth and sixth are
pasture. Flax is not so much sown now as formerly. Flax, after
paying expenses, may be worth from L. 5 to L. 6 per acre; oats
at 5 bolls per acre, L. 3, 10s.; wheat from L. 9 to L. 10; hay
from L. 5 to L. 6 on clean land; barley, L. 5; potatoes, L.16
per acre. The price of manure for an acre of land, if well done,
is L. 8, 2s. The price of labouring it, L. 1. Dung is sold at 4s.

One hundred tons costs by the Canal L. 20, or 5s. per ton.
Horse and cow-dung is sold in Kirkintilloch at 6s, per ton.
About four carts of dung are required for an acre of potatoes,
which will cost L.10. An acre of potatoes, when laboured by the
spade, costs about L. 1, 10s., for labour by the plough, L. 1, 1s.
Calculating the expense of labour as above, by the plough, per
day, there will be for three men, 6s.; three women, 3s.; a plougn
and two horses, 12s., = L. 1, 1s. The best men-servants for agri-
