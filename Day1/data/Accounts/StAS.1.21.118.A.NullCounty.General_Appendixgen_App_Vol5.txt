ny of the royal family were called lords of Brechin.  King
James the Third's second son, Alexander, was, in 1480, crea-
ted Lord Brechin and Navar; a title which was afterwards
conferred upon the Maules of Panmure.  David, 4th Lord
of Brechin, was in 1321 executed for high treason.  Um-
fraville, brother of the Earl of Angus, the most antient title
in Scotland, was so disgusted at the execution, that, after
giving David a decent burial, he repaired to King Robert
Bruce, and begged he might be allowed to sell his lands and
retire out of Scotland, as he could not live in a land where
such a man as David Lord Brechin had suffered an ignomi-
nious death.  This David was called The Flower of Chivalry.
   The castle of Brechin was built on a little eminence south
of the town, but no vestige of it is left.  It underwent a
long siege in the year 1303; was gallantly defended against
the English under Edward I; and notwithstanding all the
efforts of that potent prince, the brave governor, Thomas
Maule, held out this small fortress for twenty days, till he
was slain by a stone cart from an engine on the 20th of Au-
gust, when the place was instantly surrendered.  Patrick
Maule, descendant of the governor, was, in 1646, created
Lord Maule of Brechin and Navar, and Earl of Panmure.
   His family were patrons of the preceptory of Maison Dieu,
which had for many ages been conferred on the schoolmaster
of Brechin.  A full fourth part of the town holds feu of
the preceptor of Maison Dieu, who grants charters to his
vassals; anti, before the rebellion in 1715, there were granted
with the consent of the Earl of Panmure the patron, many
of which are still extant.  Upon the forfeiture of the Pan-
mure family in 1715, the right was vested in the crown,
who, in case of vacancy, never fails to present to the precep-
torship of Maison Dieu the person recommended by the ma-
gistrates and town-council.
