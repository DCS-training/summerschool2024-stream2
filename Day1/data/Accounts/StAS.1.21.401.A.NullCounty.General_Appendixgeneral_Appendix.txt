ing to the proportion of what he pays for the augmentation
of the glebe.  It may be objected to this scheme, that an
inconvenience might be felt by the intrant clergy, in pro-
curing stock sufficient to occupy so large a farm; most clergy-
men having no funds, or very slender ones, when admitted to
a benefice:  When it is, however, considered, that every cler-

few additional bolls of grain for seed) would not appear
very difficult to be got over:  If the clergyman is young and
vigorous at his admission, he might for a time dispense with
a riding horse, performing his journies on foot.
   As such an arrangement may not readily take place, it
may be proper to consider,

   FIRST, in towns, or where population is numerous and
labour properly subdivided, and where every convenience
and accommodation can be procured for hire; it would un-
doubtedly be most advantageous for the clergyman to con-
tract his establishment of servants to what is indispensably
necessary for mere menial service, i. e. to one housemaid, or
a housemaid and a little girl as assistant, if his family is nu-
merous:  To let his glebe for rent to some contiguous far-
mer who could labour it without additional expence of hands
or horses:  To buy his milk, cheese, butter, and meal, if he
