and are much coveted in England by the graziers, from
their shape, and being easily fattened.  They in general
have no horns, and for that reason are the more coveted
by the cattle-dealers.  Their beef is reckoned uncommon-
ly tender, delicate and juicy, and is much prized in the
Norfolk and London markets.  They have paid great at-
tention of late, in the choice of their cows and bulls, to
have them of the most approved make and shape.  There
are some of the Bakewell breed of cattle introduced here
of late years.  They breed excellent horses for the draught,
which are reckoned hardy in enduring labour, both in
ploughing and carting.  The north end of the parish being
moorish, answers well for sheep pasture.  The sheep are of
the black faced kind, are hardy, and endure the winter-
storms.  The farmers in the south end, and middle of the
parish, keep only a few sheep of the Bakewell and Cully
species for the use of their families, and a few of them for
sale.  The pasture being good, they thrive well.  There
are none of the Spanish breed here; but some of them are
introduced into the neighbourhood by Lord Daer, a young
nobleman, who pays uncommon attention to every species
of improvement that can be useful to the country, both in
agriculture, manufactures and roads.  Some hogs are pro-
duced, both for sale and for home consumption.  There are
nearly about 1200 black cattle, of which are about 220
milk cows, and the remainder, cattle of different ages, from
one to 4 years old.  The yell cattle* vary in numbers ac-
cording to the seasons of the year.  In summer they keep
more, and in winter fewer.  Their yell cattle are fed out
of doors in the winter season with straw and hay.  The
milk cows are housed.  There are in whole about 129
horses of different ages, and about 790 sheep of the differ-
ent kinds, and between 80 and 90 hogs of different ages.
There are 35 ploughs, and 58 carts employed for the pur-
