tally worn out; and a breed much larger, and abler for
the purposes of agriculture, brought originally from the
W. of Scotland, has been introduced.  A few young
horses are annually reared in this parish, partly for sale,
and partly for private use.  The breed of black cattle has
also been much enlarged, the size having been improved
by the keeping.  Considerably more are at present reared,
than fed within this parish, especially as 2 or 3 farms in
it have been of late thrown almost wholly into grass.
Both they which are bred, and they which are bought in,
are kept till they are 2 years old, and, in a few farms, till

   Rent.-Arable land is let at various rates, according to

the acre; some of it, in the neighbourhood of the town,
at almost 30 s.; and such of the borough-acres as are let,
from 50 s. even to 3 L. the acre.  Upon the whole, from
the successive rise of markets, and the improvement of land,
the rent of this parish, within these last 60 years, has
prodigiously increased.  In the year 1733, as appears from
