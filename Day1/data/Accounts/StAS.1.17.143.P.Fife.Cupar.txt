damp, vaulted dungeon, composed entirely of stone, without
a fire-place, or any the most wretched accommodation.  It
is impossible, indeed, by language, to exaggerate the horrors
which here present themselves.  Into this dismal recess, the
beams of the sun can with difficulty penetrate.  Here "is
"no light, but rather darkness visible:" A few faint rays,
entering by an irregular aperture of about 9 inches square,

procured in the rich and extensive county of Fife, were a few
men of rank and public spirit to patronize and support the
benevolent attempt.  Were the sum to be levied from the
three different orders of men, who are chiefly to be benefit-

and farmers, the proportion necessary to be advance by in-
