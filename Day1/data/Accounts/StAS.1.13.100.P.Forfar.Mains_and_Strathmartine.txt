Tradition says, that at the place where the stone is erected,
a dragon, which had devoured nine maidens, (who had
gone out on a Sunday evening, one after another, to fetch
spring water to their father), was killed by a person cal-
led Martin, and that hence it was named Martin's stone.
There is also a stone on the west gate of the church-yard,
which has the figures of serpents upon it.
