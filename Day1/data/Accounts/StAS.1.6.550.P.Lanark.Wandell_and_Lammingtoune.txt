     Statistical Account

   We chuse for our habitation an high and open place, and in
which there is much free air; whereas they preferred a close
and confined place, and low in situation.  Thus the old manse
or clergyman's house in Lamington, was lower and nearer the
burn running through the town, than it is now; hence it may
be taken for granted, that they of old were for the most part, if
not always, more healthful than we now are; and of course,
did not so much mind and perceive the want of the free air,
as we do.

   Extent, Rivers, etc.-The extent of this parish is about 9
miles in length, measuring it as lying on the Clyde, and sup-
posed to be between 3 or 4 miles in breadth, taking the adja-
cent hills into the account.  Its form resembles a rectangle, or
oblong figure, whose opposite sides are equal.-The parish is
situated on the east side of the Clyde and bordering on it.
   This river Clyde which gives name to Clydesdale, takes its
rise from an hill called Clydeslaw in the parish of Crawford,
and about 9 or 10 miles distant from Cold Chapel at the head
of this parish.  There are 10 burns or rivulets in the parish,
6 in Wandel, and 4 in Lamington.-There may be several mi-
neral waters of great use, if found out.  One attributed to a
saint, is called St. Innian's Well, and lies a little above the
town of Lamington.  It is said that state is found in the hills
of Lamington; and some years ago, search was made for coal
about Hartside in Wandel, but failed in the trial.  In the same
place also, lead was sought for, but the attempt did not succeed.

   Woods, etc.-There were antiently many woods in this pa-
rish, not only about Lamington and in the mains, but also about
Wandel, and in Woodend, or Devonshaw, and downwards
to Hartside and Braehead, or Devonshaw-hill, which grew all
the way up the bank of the Clyde, for the space of 2 miles
