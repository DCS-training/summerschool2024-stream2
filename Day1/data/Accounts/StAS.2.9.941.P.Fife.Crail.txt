     	      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-In the former Statistical Account, the name of this
parish is supposed to point out, in the Gaelic language, its situa-
tion upon a small winding or bending of the shore.  But, as in
old times it was written Carrail or Carayle, afterwards contracted
into Craill or Cryle, and in Latin it is called Oppidum or Burgum
Caralae or Caraliae, it is not improbable that it is compounded of
caer, a town, and ayle or ala, a wing or corner, which is quite de-
scriptive of the place, the town being situated in the eastern cor-
ner of the county commonly known by the name of the East
Nook o' Fife.
   Extent, Boundaries, &c.-The parish is of a very irregular
shape, and of a very unequal breadth, while its boundaries are so
ill defined that the precise number of acres which it contains
has never been ascertained, on account of its intermixture with
other parishes.  However, it acknowledgedly extends from Fife
Ness at the east, to King's Cairn at the west, a distance of about
7 miles, and from the Frith of Forth on the south, to the Ger-
man Ocean on the north, about 3 miles; but within this area are
included three farms in Kingsbarns, which were taken off when
that parish was, disjoined in 1631.  It is bounded on the south
and east by the Frith of Forth and German Ocean, extending
along the former about 3, and the latter about 2 miles; on the
north, it is, bunded by the parishes of Kingsbarns, St Leonards,
and Denino; and, on, the west, by Carnbee and Kilrenny.
   Topographical Appeorances.--When viewed from the sea, the
general appearance of the country is flat, and, owing to the want
of wood, it looks naked.  The coast is bold and rocky, with only
a few creeks, where vessls of any size can be landed with safety
