     of Dailly.

   The number of those fed on the improved pastures of the
valley is comparatively small, but the great profits they are
found to bring, will probably lead to its increase.  In the course
of a single season, they generally treble their value; and a
small parcel of indifferent ewes, introduced into rich pasture
about the end of October, have, with their lambs and fleeces,
been known in one year to rise from 5 s. to 20 s. each.
   The following statement of the quantity and value of stock,
and of the annual produce of land, in the parish of Dailly, has
been collected from the best information which could be pro-
cured; and approaches, perhaps, as nearly to accuracy as can
be expected, in an inquiry where we must often resort to pro-
bable calculation and conjecture, to supply the place of abso-
lute certainty and truth.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Under the term best cattle, are comprehended milch cows,
and stock for immediate sale  Inferior cattle comprehends the
rising stock of two years old and under  Supposing the whole
cattle divided into 9 parts, the proportions assigned to each of
these kinds would be, milch cows, 2-sale stock 4-young cattle
3.-The average prices of all these kinds fall greatly short of
what they sometimes bring  Young bullocks, at the end of the
third summer, have, in some instances, been sold for 7 L. or 8 L.
each.

+Best sheep are those fed on improved pasture: inferior
sheep, those fed on the moor-lands  The former are calculated
to yield 70 stone of wool annually, at 11 s. per stone, the latter
430 stone, at 9 s. per stone; amounting in all to L. 232.
