     Statistical Account, Etc.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The general size of the peo-
ple is from 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 10 inches, a few are
below, but many above those sizes.  They are slender, ac-
tive and hardy, differing considerably in make and figure
from the people on the south of the Grampians.  They are
industrious, humane, economical, and enjoy the com-
forts of society in a reasonable degree, and in proportion
to their rank and circumstances.  Their condition might,
however, be meliorated, if the proprietors would give longer
leases; oblige the tenants to adopt more modern and pro-
ductive plans of farming; furnish them at first, with turnip
and grass seeds; bind them to inclose, and improve a certain
portion of ground annually, and allow them the expence of
the inclosures, at the expiry of their leases.  The roads are
in better repair in this than in most other parishes; the
statute labour has hitherto been exacted in kind; and al-
thought a commutation has been proposed, it has not, in ge-
neral, been agreed on as the most proper mode for this
country.-The bear crop in 1782 was tolerably good, but
oats and potatoes almost totally failed.  The principal he-
ritor took  a good deal of trouble in procuring victual, as
also grain and potatoes for feed; hence the parish was as well
supplied as any in the neighbourhood.  The fuel generally
made use of, is turf and heath from the hills, there being
very little peat to be got in the parish.  Heath is particu-
larly used in kiln-drying, brewing, and baking.  About 30
years ago, charred peat was so universally used by the
blacksmiths, that few could work with any thing else.  But
now they use coal only, over all the country.
