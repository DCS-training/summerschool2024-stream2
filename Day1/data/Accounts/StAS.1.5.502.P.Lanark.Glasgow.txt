most general attention, is the manufacture of cotton cloths
of various kinds, together with the arts depending on it.
For this purpose cotton mills, bleachfields, and printfields,
have been erected on almost all the streams in the
neighbourhood, affording water sufficient to move the
machinery, besides many erected at a very considerable
distance; and though the number of these mills have
increased greatly of late, yet they are still unable to
supply the necessary quantity of yarn, required by the
increased manufactures, as a considerable quantity is still
daily brought from England.  This trade not only em-
ploys a great number of persons in Glasgow, but is extend-
ed over a very large tract of country in the neighbourhood,
many weavers being employed by the Glasgow manufac-
turers, 20 and 30 miles from the city.  In 1791, it was
computed, that they employed 15,000 looms; that each
loom gave employment to nine persons at an average, in-
cluding women and children, in the different stages of the
manufacture, from picking the cotton wool, until the
goods were brought to market, making in all 135,000
persons; and that each loom, at an average, produced 
goods to the value of L. 100 per ann. making L. 1,500,000.
The increase, since that calculation was made, has been very
great; but to what extent it is at present carried, cannot be
said with any precision, for want of sufficient data.  This
manufacture is not only important in itself, but is produc-
tive of work to many thousands of bleachers, tambourers,
callico printers, etc. many of whom, being women and chil-
dren, whose work was formerly unproductive, renders it of
still more importance to the country.  Though this great
manufacture has, in some measure, supplanted the linen
trade, which used to be the staple manufacture of the west
of Scotland, there is yet, however, a very great quantity
of linens, lawns, cambries, checks, diapers, etc. still made,
