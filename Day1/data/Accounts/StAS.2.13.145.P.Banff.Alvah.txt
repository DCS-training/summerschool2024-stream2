       The hill of Alvah stands apart from any other considerable or
       immediate elevation ; but the hill of Maunderlea, proceeding in a
       northerly direction from the parish of Marnoch, is connected with
       a series of minor elevations, which are scattered over the western
       and south-western division of the parish, and which give to this dis-
       trict a bleak and hilly appearance, strikingly contrasted with the
       woodland scenery which adorns the sloping sides of the hill of Al-
       vah, and the rich and fertile lands which encircle its base.  From
       the summit of this latter hill, the view is extensive, varied, and pic-
       turesque, and on an unclouded evening of summer, cannot be con-
       templated but with the most pleasing emotions.  Towards the
       east, as far as the eye can reach, appears a large portion of the
       level, naked, and, comparatively speaking, uninteresting district of
       Buchan, having its otherwise monotonous aspect relieved, how-
       ever by the bold and projecting headlands of Gamrie and Troup,
       which rise in frowning majesty along its shore; - on the south is be-
       held the Doveran flowing along between banks of the most fertile
       description, and here and there adorned with gentlemen's seats
       empowered amid thriving plantations,-the well known mountains
       of Bennochie, the Buck of the Cabrach, and further to the south-
       west, BeIrinnes, appearing witb imposing dignity along the line of
       the distant horizon.  Looking in the direction of the north, the spec-
       tator beholds spread out, as it were, on a map below him, the pic-
       turesque and highly embellished scenery, amid which stands con-
       spicuous, Duff House, the classical and magnificent mansion of
       the Earl of Fife,-the Doveran winding amid the surrounding woods
       in many a tortuous maze, as if loth to quit so fair a scene, and at
       length flowing into the ocean at Banff, which, together with the
       adjoining bay, is from this eminence distinctly visible;   mile, far in
       the west and north-west, are seen relieved against the evening sky,
       the fantastic forms of the Caithness hills, behind which the sun
       is setting, and is throwing a parting gleam of molten gold across
       the broad bosom of the Moray Frith, the whole of which is stretch-
       ed out before the spectator in mellow and unbroken pose, save
       where here and there is espied the white sail of some distant vessel.
          The river Doveran may be considered as the natural boundary
       of Alvah on the east, although the estates of Inverichny and Dun'-
       lugas are situated on its eastern bank.  This river, while within
       the parish of Alvah, flows nearly from south to north, and, includ-
       ing its numerous and beautiful windings, has a course of more than
       six miles in length. Where it enters the parish, it flows between
