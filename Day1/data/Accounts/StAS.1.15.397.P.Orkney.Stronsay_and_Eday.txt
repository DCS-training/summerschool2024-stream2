     of Stronsay and Eday.

nual average price at market was 4 L. 4 s. Sterling; the price
of making was raised to about 26 s. and freight 12 s. per
ton.
   The heritors and kelp proprietors of this district, drew an-
nually about 350 L.  The tenants and makers about 230 L.  The
remainder went for freight and commission.
   In 1778, and for fourteen years after, the average quanti-
ty annually burnt in Orkney, was 3000 tons, at 6 L. per ton.
The heritors of this district had about 300.  The price of
making was raised to 1 L. 15 s. per ton, of which rise the
tenants chiefly reaped the benefit.  The heritors and kelp
proprietors of this district, drew annually about 105 l.  The
tenants 527 L.  The remainder went for freight and com-
mission.
   In 1792, the extraordinary good season for the growth of
sea weeds, of which kelp is made, and for the manufactur-
ing of it, produced in this district, to the incumbent's certain
knowledge or best information, no less a quantity than 400
tons; when, at the same time, the whole Orkney islands did
not produce above 4,000 tons.  It is in this ratio, therefore,
that he has calculated the produce of this district from the
year 1744, during the several subsequent periods above spe-
cified, and 60 tons, the average quantity annually produced
preceding that date; which, in the earliest period, is a some-
what larger proportion, which Stronsay (where kelp was
first manufactured in Orkney,) may reasonably be supposed
to have produced.
   In 1793, the season proved rainy and unfavourable for
kelp.  This district did not produce above 300 tons, price
in Orkney 4 L. per ton.  The heritors and kelp proprietors
drew 775 L.; the tenants and kelp makers, 525 l. Sterling,
clear of all deductions, being in the same proportions as
the year preceding.
