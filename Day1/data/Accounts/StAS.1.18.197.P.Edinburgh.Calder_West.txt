parent, but the circumstances which could lead to the period
at which they were coined, where completely effaced.  Ex-
cepting this circumstance there are no proofs of ancient po-
pulation within this district.
   There are a few names of places, as Briech, Cobbershaw,
and Polbeth, which seem to be of Gaelic derivation.  But
in every instance where a Gaelic name is employed, there is
a river, or a morass, or a wood, to which the name might
have been given before the country was inhabited.  In all
other instances, the names of places, farm houses, etc. are
in the old Scottish dialect, and indicate a recent date.  The
following names may be mentioned as examples; Blackmire,
Heugh-head, Slate-heugh, Birny-hill, Moss-end, Rashie-
hill, Back-i-the-moss, Stank-head, Whitesykes, and Turni-
moon.

   Coal, etc.-The greater part of this parish most probably
stands on coal.  It has been dug for in various places, but
never to much advantage, except at Longford, on the estate
of Mr Douglas of Baads.  The working of this coal has been
discontinued for many years.  But we understand, that
the proprietor has now given a lease; and some attempts
have been already made to find out the best place for erecting
an engine.
   Limestone is also found here in great abundance.  One
great lime-work at Limefield is now nearly exhausted.
The stratum of limestone seems to have been in thickness
about nine or ten feet, with a free-stone roof, and a dip of
one foot in three.  Great pillars have been left to support the
roof, and the limestone has been every where wrought down
to the level.  By this means an excavation has been
formed worthy of the attention of the curious observer.
