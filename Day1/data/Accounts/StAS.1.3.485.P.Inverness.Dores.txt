   Antiquities.-At the distance of 3 miles from the lake, are
to be seen the vestiges of a sort, called Costal Dunriachan,
which some reckon a corruption of Castal Dun Ri-chuan, or
the Castle of the King of the Ocean, a name which it is suppo-
sed to have got, at the period when the king of Norway
and Denmark was master of the sea.  A little to the east of
that sort, there are several cairns or heaps of stones, and one al-
most equal in size to all the rest.  Tradition reports that
FINGAL, so much celebrated in Ossian's poems, here engag-
ed in battle Asbi, the son of the Norwegian king, and killed
him, which gave the name of Drumashi, or Ashi's Hill, to
the scene where this event happened.  The inhabitants
point out the chair where Fingal rested on the occasion, and
which is still called Sheir Finn, or Fingal's Chair.  About 9
miles distant there is another fort called Dundardell, which
is said to have been one of the many forts in the great val-
ley, extending from the German Ocean at Inverness, to the
Atlantic at Fort William, that were intended for making
signals, by fire, of the enemy's approach, during the times of
the Danish and Norwegian incursions; and indeed they are
so situated, with respect to each other, as to be very well cal-
culated for such a purpose.

   General Character.-The people, in general, are sober,
quiet, and industrious.  There are, however, some exceptions.
The tenants would be better pleased with their condition, if
they obtained longer leases than are commonly granted them,
and their servants were more moderate in regard to wages.
