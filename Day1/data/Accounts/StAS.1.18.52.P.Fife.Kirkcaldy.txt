     Statistical Account

so many of those on whom the law rests the burden of the
poor, bestow neither time, nor thought, nor money, to pro-
vide for them, it is not improbable that kirk sessions, whose
attention to the poor is merely "a labour of love"; to
which they are no otherwise bound, than by the common
obligations of humanity, will find themselves constrained to
do in general, what some of them already threaten, give up
collecting at the church doors, and leave it to the civil ma-
gistrate to make provision for the poor, by putting the laws
for their support in execution.
   It is fortunate for the poor of this parish that they do not
all depend upon the public funds.  The society of seamen,
the company of merchants, the incorporated trades, the malt-
men, the carters, have all of them separate boxes for assisting
the poor of their respective societies.  The seamen, in par-
ticular, have funds, arising partly from rents and feu-duties,
and partly from a poundage on the wages of sailors, which e-
nable them to pay annually to indigent members of their so-
ciety, or to their widows and families, about L. 40, besides
furnishing ten of them with a house to lodge in.

   Charitable Associations.-Three different associations have
of late been formed here, for the purpose of assisting the
members, when their ordinary labour is suspended by dis-
tress.  There are all constituted on the same general plan.
Each member, besides a small sum paid on his admission,
contributes at the rate of one penny in the week, and re-
ceives weekly, when confined, 3 shillings.  To those, whose
daily subsistence depends on their personal industry, this is
often a seasonable supply; and the meanest labourer can
without difficulty afford the contribution which entitles him
to receive it.
