   Inns, Alehouses, &c.-A small inn has long been kept, at Lewes
of Fyvie in this neighbourbood.  Nine persons hold licenses for
the sale of spirits within the parish.  These do not all keep ale-
houses, some of them only retailing spirits along with other ar-
ticles of merchandise but their number might be reduced with
advantage to the community.
   Fuel.-The ordinary description of fuel used here is peat, the
principal, supply of which is obtained from the mosses in the north
quarter of the parish.  In consequence of our distance from the
coast, coal is very expensive, the price of carriage being nearly
equal to the original cost.

               I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE ancient name of the parish was Peterugie, aris-
ing, perhaps, from the rocky headland or promontory near the mouth
of the Ugie.  A small island between the town and sea is called
Keith Inch; the town in the charter of erection, in 1593, by
George Earl Marischall is named Keith Inch, alias Peterhead;
and since that time the name of the whole parish and town has
been Peterhean.  In old charters, the name is Petri promontorium
and Petripolis; for other etymologies the reader is referred to
the former account of the parish.
   Extent, &c.-This parish extends along the coast in a straight
line about four miles, bending along the sea shore about five miles,
and from east to west it extends from three to four miles.  it is
bounded on the south, by the parish of Craden; on the west, by
Longside; on the north, by Saint Fergus; and on the east, by the
German Ocean.
   The area of the parish is about 9085 imperial acres, or nearly
