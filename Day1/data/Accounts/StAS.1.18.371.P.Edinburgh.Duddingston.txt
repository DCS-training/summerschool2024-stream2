tion of the same fraudulent retribution against himself.
Thus at last, either from the stubborness of despair, the
relish for bribes and indulgences, and the habitual taste for
extravagance so imprudently fostered, the men get into their
rebellious moods, and refuse to work without some new
bribe, or perhaps unless their wages be raised in propor-
tion to the increase of price, to which their masters may
have chosen to raise the coal itself.  There is another
circumstance, which, though it does not so much corrupt
the morals of the persons concerned, contributes however
to aggravate the dearth, and to raise irregularly the price
of coals.  When it is presumed that the demand and the
price of this article will rise considerably in the market, a mul-
titude of carters and coal drivers abandon their common occu-
pations, flock to this new traffic, and become the carriers,
in the hope of an advanced and exorbitant profit.  As it is
impossible to supply this sudden increase of carriers with
immediate freights, many of them are compelled to stand
all night, and sometimes all day to boot, upon the hills,
waiting their turns for loading.  Upon their cart load, they
are afterwards compelled to lay not only the ordinary price of
carriage, but this extraordinary expence of attendance and
risk; while it is evident, that half the number of carts might
remove all the produce of the pits in the same time, and find
regular employment with moderate and less hazardous gains.
Convenient remedies for these errors might be easily discover-
ed and profitably applied.
