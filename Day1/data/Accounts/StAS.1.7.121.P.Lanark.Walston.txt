ceive it.  The cheapest way, therefore, and the best way for
the morals of the people, to supply the poor, where it can be
done, is to do it by the kirk-session.  The elders know the
circumstances of every individual in the parish, prevent impo-
sition, and often discover modest merit in want.  This confi-
deration should engage every person to be as liberal as his-
circumstances will admit in contributing towards the parish
funds.  Sectaries of every denomination receive supply when
they need it from the parish funds; but, though they give
some occasional supply to indigent persons, it is but a small
proportion of the weekly collections that are made in their
churches which is employed for the maintenance of the poor.
This has a great tendency to diminish parish funds, and to
bring on poor's rates upon parishes.  To prevent to great an
evil as the poor's rates, or an assessment for poor's money,
the non-residing heritors also should, look upon themselves as
in justice bound to make an annual donation to the poor's
funds of those parishes where they have any property.

   Wages, Price of Provision, Etc.-The wages of a man-ser-
vant, when maintained in the family, 40 years ago, were
about 3 L. Sterling, now from 5 L. to 7 L.; of a woman-ser-
vant, 2 L. now 3 L. per annum s of a day-labourer who recei-
ved no victuals, 8 d. per day, now 1 s.  The wages which
the common labourer receives, together with his wife's in-
dustry, enable him not only to bring up a family, but also to
give them education.  They are all taught to read and write,
and many of them to keep accounts.  Few of them, how-
ever, are able to provide for sickness or old age.  Before
marriage, they generally expend the molt part of their wages
in purchasing fine clothes.  This leaves them but little to
furnish their house, and begin the world.
