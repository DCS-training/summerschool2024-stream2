Hector Boethius at Paris.  The last preceptor was Sir 
James Sandilands, second son to Sir James Sandilands of 
Calder.  Sandilands, at the Reformation, resigned all the 
lands of the Johanites in Scotland into Queen Mary's 
hands, who feued them out again to him for 10,000
crowns, and the yearly annuity of 500 merks.  She also
erected all the foresaid lands into a temporal lordship,
in favour of him and his heirs, in 1563.  The Templars
cross was ordered to be put upon all houses that were

it may rather have been a druidical place of workship.-

man.
