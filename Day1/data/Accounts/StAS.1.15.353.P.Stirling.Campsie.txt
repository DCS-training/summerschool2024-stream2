   Upon the different lines of roads, there are no less than
19 stone bridges, 4 of which are a-cross the Kelvin.  It may
be observed, that there are several old causeways in the pa-
rish, on the line of road leading to the parish church, which,
tradition says, were made by offenders in ancient times, by
way of penance; particularly the causeways made by the se-
ven brothers of the name of M'Donald; there shew the stile
in which roads were formed in those early days; as far as
can be perceived, they consisted of one large whinstone in
the middle, with smaller ones on each side in rows, the
breadth of the road being about six feet.  There is one radi-
cal defect attending the roads of this distrcit; the soil being
gravelly, when a sudden thaw comes after a severe frost in
winter, the ground becomes so spungy, as to be almost im-
passable, which can only be rectified by making a layer of
beat whinstone below the water gravel, a practice seldom
followed.  The following table exhibits the state of our
roads, and the prices levied at the toll-bar:

<FOOTNOTE>

the act expresses, that all those receiving public charity shall be exempted;
perhaps it might be an improvement, if women and men, after a certain age;
should be excused from paying parish burdens; it would please them, and the
public would not be great losers by such mitigation.
