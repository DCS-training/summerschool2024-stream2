nearly on a level with those of England.-The enclosures are laid
out with taste, and afford evidence that practical farming in this
part of the country keeps pace with modern improvement.
   Quarries.-Several quarries of freestone are found in the parish.
The principal is that of Whitsome (Old) Newton, situate at the
southern extremity of the parish. Its stone is of the best quality,
and can be raised to any size. Out of it the chief edifices in Ber-
wickshire have been built, and its excellence is duly appreciated in
the neighbouring counties.
   Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce is valued
at, viz.

                        V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   The village, for there is but one, lies in a direction of east and
west, and, exclusive of the farm-houses and cottages of Herriot Bank
and Leetside, consists of seventeen houses, feued from the Black-
adder estate, seven cottages on the property of Whitsome-bill,-the
school-house, on the highest part of Hardie's-hill,-the church, on
the western declivity of the same eminence,-and the manse at a
short distance, also situated on a gently rising ground.
   The nearest market-towns are Dunse, seven miles distant towards
the west, Coldstream eight miles south, and Berwick ten miles
north-east. At all of these places, monthly markets are held for
sheep and cattle, and weekly for corn. Berwick, however, being a
sea-port, is the chief grain-mart.
   Means of Communication, &c.-From Whitsome a carrier pro-
ceeds once a-week, to Dunse on Wednesday, to Edinburgh on
Friday, and to Berwick on Saturday. Letters are transmitted
through the post at Swinton, which lies at a distance of three-miles.
The length of the parish roads is 12 5/8 miles, and of those under
trust, 3 1/2. They are kept in repair by converted statute-labour,
the annual amount of which is L. 54, 1s. 6d. This sum is levied
on nineteen masters at 3s.; fifty-five servants at 3s.; thirteen cottagers
at 1s. 6d.; 108 horses at 7s. 6d.; and 8 mares in foal at 3s. 9d. each.
