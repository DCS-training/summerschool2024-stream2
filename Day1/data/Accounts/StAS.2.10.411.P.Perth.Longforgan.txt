  The average of baptisms does not exactly, but yet very nearly,
represent the average of births, because, though by far the greater
number of births are entered in the baptismal register, yet all of
them are not.  Neither does the record of burials entirely corre-
spond with the number of deaths, though the difference must be
trifling.  Persons belonging to this parish are occasionally interred
elsevhere.  But the funerals, too, of those resident in neighbour-
ing parishes are brought to the burying ground of this, so that the
one may not unfairly be set off against the other.

        The average number of persons under 15 years of age is 585
                                      betwixt 15 and 30,       476
                                              30 and 50,       324

   Land-owners.-There are eight land-owners, viz.  George
Paterson of Castle Huntly; Lord Kinnaird; James Mylne of
Mylnefield; Patrick Kinnear of Lochton; Lord Douglas Gordon
Hallyburton of North Ballo; Captain Trotter of South Ballo;
William Drummond of Newton; and Mrs Kiell of East Newton.
Of these only two are at present resident.  The properties are very
various in point of extent, but the smallest of them exceeds the
yearly value of L. 50.
   The number, so far as it can be ascertained, of unmarried men,
bachelors and widowers, upwards of fifty years of age, is 28; and
of unmarried women upwards of forty-five, 24.
   There are 378 families, including bothies, in the parish, of whom
117 are chiefly employed in agriculture; 100 in trade, manufac-
tures, and handicraft; and 161 not comprised in the two prebdd-
ing classes.  There is 1 insane person in confinement; 2 fatuous;
and 4 deaf and dumb, 3 of whom belong to one family.
  Character, Manners, &c. of the People.-The people, generally
speaking, may be described as industrious in their several callings,
as neat and cleanly in their house and personal habits, and as en-
joying a reasonable portion of the comforts and advantages of so-
ciety.  A sensible improvement in point of dress has taken place,
partly arising, no doubt, from the comparatively low price at which
most of the articles of wearing apparel are now to be procured.
Many are accustomed of feed and kill at least one pig in the
