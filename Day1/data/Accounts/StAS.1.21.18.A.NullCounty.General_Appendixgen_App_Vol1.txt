It is observable, that in England, which is far more popu-
lous and richer than Scotland, the monopoly of farms is lit-
tle known.  In many places of Scotland, particularly the
district to which Hounam belongs, a single individual has
not only united four or five farms into one, in one parish,
but has several farms united in this manner, in different pa-
rishes.  These circumstances taken together surely make
it very evident, that the monopoly of farms, and increase
of pasturage, is a great injury to the population of the
country at large.

   Houses.-As the number of inhabitants has rapidly di-
minished, of course there are many empty houses in the
parish, and many have of late been demolished.  In the
year 1775, there were no fewer than nine houses, with cot-
tagers in them, at a place called Mainside, all of whom I
visited on my admission.  In one year after, or two at most,
the whole of them were thrown down, to make way for a
single farmhouse and its offices.  The farmers, too, paying
more attention to their sheep walks than formerly, will
hardly allow a single house to stand on any part of their
farm, except such as are necessary for their shepherd's ac-
commodation, that the sheep may not be disturbed by the
passing of people to and from the houses.  For some few
years after my admission, there were thee corn milns and
kilns in the parish; and for some years past there has been
only one, and that one not very much frequented.  The
houses pulled down, and uninhabited, within the last ten or
fifteen years, will amount to above 30; not above 4 or 5
houses rebuilt.

   Water of Kale.-Kale takes its rise in the parish of Ox-
nam, not far above the Hindhopes.  It runs meandering, in
