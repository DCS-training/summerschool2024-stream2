  Hydrography.--The streams in this district are neither large
nor numerous. The water of Kelvin, which is the chief, rises
near Orchard, in the parish of Kilsytlh, and runs in a direction
nearly due west, towards the Clyde, forming the boundary between
the counties of Stirling and Dumbarton. Its course through these
parishes is far from picturesque, and more resembles a great ditch,
or one of the slow sluggish streams of the south, than the "jouk-
ing burnies," or "rattling roaring torrents," which sweep over
their channelly or rocky beds in these northern latitudes. Before
reaching the Clyde, however, near Glasgow, its stream expands,
its banks become elevated, bold, wooded, and highly picturesque,
and being studded here and there with elegant country seats, and
smart villas, are altogether worthy of the beautiful ballad in their
praise, entitled "Kelvin Grove," so well known, and so deserv-
edly popular in the west of Scotland. Near to Kirkintilloch the
Kelvin is crossed by a bridge, and is about forty yards broad. The
Luggie, a tributary of the Kelvin, is the next stream of importance.
It suddenly bursts up in a large and vigorous spring in the midst
of a morass, on the farm of Torbrax, in the parish of Cumber-
nauld. After entering this parish at Dalshannan, it forms the
boundary between it and Lanarkshire till Barbeth, where it entire-
ly enters the parish of Kirkintilloch, and runs by Duntiblae and
Oxgang, and joins the Kelvin to the north-west of the town of
Kirkintilloch. Throughout the greater part of its course, it keeps
by the level grounds, and is, like the Kelvin, a slow muddy ditch-
like stream, subject occasionally to great inundations. The banks

The notes from which I quote are not so distinct after this date. It is stated that
the average of rain for seven years before 1788, which was a remarkably dry year,
was 25 inches, whereas in l788 it was only 14.5. On the 29th and 90th May 1809,
there was the greatest fall of snow ever known at the season of the year. The snow
was nearly a foot deep. There was also a great frost, the rivers frozen, and many
trees broken down by the weight of the snow.
