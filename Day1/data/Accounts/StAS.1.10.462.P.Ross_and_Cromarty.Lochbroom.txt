tracts are not altogether useless, as they serve for pasture to
a great number of black cattle.  There is, however, a great
deal of fine arable lands in which they usually raise pretty
rich crops.  These fertile spots are for the most part close
by the sea side; from which they extends in some places, in
the form of long valleys, to the distance of two computed
miles and upwards, such as the Meikle and little Straths, Stroth-
Cainard, etc.  Besides these places, which usually produce rich
crops both of corn and grass, there are a few good glens,
wholly-detached from the sea, which are also pretty fertile.
In these straths and glens, and different other parts of the
parish, there are woods of various kinds; particularly, fir,
birch, ash, and aller.  There are also some rivers and fresh-
water lakes, which furnish some trouts and salmon.  And,
upon the whole, the surface of this parish yields an agreeable
variety,of hill and dale, wood and water, corn and grass.

   Soil, Produce, and Cultivation.-The soil, though fertile, is
not in general deep, but rather light jingly.  The crops con-
sist of barleys oats, and pease, together with a great quantity
of potatoes.  They seldom begin to sow till towards the lat-
ter end of April, and sometimes the barley, is not wholly
laid down till the middle of Jane.  The harvest, however,
is commonly early; and, excepting some bad years, the
crop is usually all gathered in by the middle of October.
The chief implements of husbandry are the plough and the
crooked spade; they sometimes, however, use common spades
and pick-axes.  The manure most used is sea-ware, which is
got in considerable quantities on the adjacent shores.  They
also make a few compound dunghills; and some of the more
substantial of the farmers use a small quantity of shelly sand,
of which there is a large bank towards the northern extremi-
ty of the parish.  From this place it is carried in vessels
