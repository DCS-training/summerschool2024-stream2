are applied to the support from 12 to 17 paupers, none of
whom are permitted to go about begging, though the country
is overrun with people of that description.  In the bad sea-
sons of 1782 and 1783, the kirk-session were obliged to extend
their charity more generally, and, with the consent of the he-
titors, laid out a part of their capital in purchasing grain to
supply the poorer inhabitants, of the parish, who were in
those years reduced to great want.

coopers, and turners, two of whom make a variety of musi-
cal instruments without any education for that purpose; 6
weavers, 3 black-smiths, 10 taylors, 6 country merchants, 4
