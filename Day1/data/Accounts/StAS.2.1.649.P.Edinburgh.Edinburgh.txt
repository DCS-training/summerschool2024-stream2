with St Giles' Church in the centre; and it is in contemplation
to consolidate the whole territory into one municipality. The
bounds of police have already been extended over the parliamen-
tary district.
   The extent of the city actually built on is about two miles from
west to east; and about the same from north to south.
   In 1663 the city was divided into six parishes; and in 17-53,
according to Maitland, there were twelve churches, including one
in the Castle. Maitland also enumerates the streets, which
amounted to twelve. These were Bristo Street, Canongate, Cow-
gate, Grassmarket, High Street, Lawnmarket, Lauriston, Luck-
enbooths, Newington, Pleasance, Portsburgh, Potterrow. Milne's
Square was the only square then existing. There were 22 wynds,
8 courts or small squares, and 260, closes.

The annual value of real property in Edinburgh and Leith, as
taken in 1815 for the income tax, was estimated at L. 487,000; in
1841 the number of inhabited houses in Edinburgh was, according
to the census, 22,523; of uninhabited, 1708; and building, 21.
   Rent.-The rents of single floors or flats, in what are called com-
mon stairs, range from L. 10 to L. 40 per annum. The rents of
whole houses, or self-contained houses, vary from L. 40 to L. 80
and L. 150, according to size and locality. The local taxes
amount to about 25 per cent. on the rent.
   Population.-We have no accurate means of ascertaining what
was the actual population of Edinburgh previous to the government
census of 1801. The above estimates of the number of houses within
the city and liberties for three different periods, may, however, af-
for some data. lf we take the number of person in each family to
amount at an average to five, by multiplying the number of houses
by five and perhaps allowing from 1000 to 2000 additional for
soldiers and invalids in hospitals, &C. we shall have a pretty near
approximation to the truth. Maitland reckons the average num-
ber in a family at 5 1/2, and Arnot at 6. In a communication from
Dr Blair in the former Statistical Account, the population, in-
cluding Leith, in 1722, is estimated at 40,420. Mr Arnet reck-
