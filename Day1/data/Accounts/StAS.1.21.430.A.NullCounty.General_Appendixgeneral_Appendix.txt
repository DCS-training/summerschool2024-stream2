     General Appendix to

   The sums collected in the three parishes, Portree, Snizorf
and Kilmuir, for the support of schoolmasters, were, about
thirty years ago, joined together, at Portree, for the purpose
of procuring a master of ability and regular education; of
consequence, the school erected there became a distinguished
seminary of learning, and prepared many young men for the
university.-We have only one society school in the parish;
it is generally well attended.

   The poor receiving alms are about sixty.  There is no fund,
nor regular fixed establishment for their support.  Small
Sabbath collections, and fines from delinquents, (all amount-
ing to very little,) are distributed among them, in proportion
to their respective need:  And our truly worthy young noble-
man, Lord Macdonald, has, two years ago, when he first
came to the country, allotted a sum of money to be laid out
in annual pensions to the neediest of the above, recommend-
ed by me; which recommendation was accompanied with a
description, in writing, of the condition of every individual.
At that time, and upon his arrival this year, he has added
handsomely to our Sabbath collections.  He also ordered pen-
sions to be given in all the other parishes on the estate.

   This parish terminates the most northern point of Skye,
and the inhabited part is a semicircle.  The length of the
parish along the semicircle is 11 computed miles, above 16
English; and the breadth about 8 of the latter.  Part of the
land is under corn, part laid out for pasture, and a small pro-
portion for meadow hay.  All the mountains, and part of
the low ground, are covered with heath.  There are no
woods.
