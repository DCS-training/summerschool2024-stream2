     Statistical Account

harvest begins generally about the end of August, and ends,
in good years, about the middle of October.  There are a-
bout 800 oxen, and it is believed 500 horses, of the small
Scots of Highland kind; though the few gentlemen in the
parish, use horses of a better size.  There may be 150
milk cows; about 1000 sheep of the small Scots king,
their wool neither coarse nor very fine.  There may be
about 450 swine sold annually from this parish, to Tain,
Cromarty, Fort George, and Inverness, at various prices;
the smaller kind from 8 s. 10 s. to L. 1, and the larger
from L. 1 to L. 2,10 s.  There may be about 200 oxen bought
into this parish annually, and about 250 oxen and cows
sold yearly at Whitsunday and Martinmas.-There are
140 ploughs, generally 6 oxen in the plough; some use 8,
several use 4 oxen and  2 horses.  It is the old Scots plough
that is used, with a few exceptions.  But little of the pa-
rish is inclosed.  The produce is much greater than is suf-
ficient for the consumption of the inhabitants; above two-
thirds of the whole is exported out of the parish, in oats
and oat-meal, to Cromarty, Inverness, and Leith.  But the
barley is partly distilled in the neighbourhood, in Ferin-
tosh, and the adjacent country.  Monopoly of farms has
taken place here; there being instances in this and the 
neighbouring parishes, of individuals farming what was for-
merly possessed by 4, 6, 8, and 10 tenants.  There are little
or no perennial services performed by any tenants or under-
tenants in the parish.  There were several days of servi-
tude about 20 or 30 years ago, such as manuring and plough-
ing the master's farm for 2 or 3 days in the spring, cutting
down his corns, and leading his peats and turf, for as
many days; but all these are now converted.

   Stipend, School, and Poor.-The living consists of 128
bolls of barley, with 100 merks Scots, for small teinds,
