etc. are very good and fetch high prices.  Meal last summer
sold at Finzcan's girnell at 17 s. per boll of 9 stone.  The north
and south roads, passing through the middle of the parish, give
the farmers many and easy opportunities of falling in with
the south country dealers in cattle.  The parish is well supplied
with garden plants from Auchoor and Mill-town of Auch-
lossen, where 3 gardeners reside.  It has likewise a good school-
master, but his encouragement is small, and the school built
in a very improper place.  Many cattle are reared here, and
the principal roads are not bad.  On the other hand, the pa-
rish no less than 24 measured miles from Aberdeen; has no
lime nor marle, nor can the high grounds often get any advan-
taged from waterings grass is scarce, and few cattle be kept
in summer.  The farmers must often sell them to great dis-
advantage when the labouring is finished, put them to glens, or
starve them at home.  The sheep are often a pray to the foxes
from the woods of Craigievar and Abeyne.  The fuel is fetch-
ed from the distance of 2 computed miles, and on bye roads
where carts are drawn with danger and diffuculty.  Little is
done by many from Whitsunday to the beginning of autumn
but to cast, dry, and lead peats.  Some think it would be as
cheap to bring coals from Aberdeen.  The north and south
roads, too, are attended with some inconveniences from beg-
gars and pilterers.  The mill multures are heavy, the tenants
affirm, that in multures, etc. they pay 1 boll in 12.

   Language Rent, etc.-None of the parishioners speak or
understand Gaelic, though the names of most places are said
to be derived therefrom, as Auchlossen, Auchoor, etc.  The
valued rent is L. 2082:6:8 d.  Scotch, and the real rent may
be about L. 1000 sterling.  The stipend is L. 36:5 s. including
20 merks for communion elements with 23 1/2 bolls of meal
