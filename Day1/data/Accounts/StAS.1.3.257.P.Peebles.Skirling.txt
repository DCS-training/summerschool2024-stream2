average near 200 acres.  The rent, at an average, is 4 s. per
acre.  Besides these ten farms, there are ten smaller posses-
sions about this village, which are inclosed with hedges and
ditches, and with belts of planting.  They are rented at 20 s.
and 25 s. per acre.  There is a map of the parish in the hands
of Cornelius Elliot, Efq; writer to the signet.  I suppose
there are between 2000 and 3000 acres in it.  The roads in
this parish, are, at present, in bad repair, owing to a great
part of the lead, from Leadhills and Wenlockhead, passing
from one end of it to the other.  The statute labour is exact-
ed in kind, and is found to be inadequate to the keeping of 
the roads in proper repair.
