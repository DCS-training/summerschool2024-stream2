   Fuel and Labour.-There are no manufactures, owing to
the dearness of fuel.  Coals must be chiefly depended on;
and they are brought 28 and 30 miles from Lothian, at
the rate of I s. per cwt.  Few or no peats are to be had;
but the people are much benefited by weedings of
plantations, which are frequently sold in the neighbour-
hood.  Small feuers and tenants, who have not ground
enough to employ themselves and horses, drive coal, lime.
and marl for hire; the lime at 9 s. and the marl at 1 s. 4 d.
per two horse cart, or at 4 s. per day for a man, cart, and
2 horses.  The wages of a man-servant, who eats in the
house, are from L. 7 to L. 8 Sterling per annum.  Maid-
servants get L. 2, 10 s. and L. 2, 15 s. for the summer, and
L. 1, 5 s. for the winter half-year.  But a married farm-
servant, who provides his own victuals, receives about the
value of L. 14 or L. 15 Sterling in oats, barley, pease, flax,
potatoe, and the maintenance of a cow through the year.
Upon these wages he may bring up his family in a decent
manner, and give his children a tolerable education, if he
and his wife be industrious and frugal.  In harvest, which
commonly lasts about four weeks, a man gets L. 1, 6 s. and
a woman L. 1, and their maintenance.  At all other times,
a man gets 1 s. 2 d. per day, and a woman 7 d. or 8 d. in
summer*, and a man 1 s. in winter, both furnishing their
own victuals.  Men working by the piece do at least 1-4th,
if not 1-3d more than on day's wages; which makes their
employers let as much work by the piece as they can.  A
mason earns 1 s. 8 d. and a carpenter 1 s. 6 d. per day with-
out victuals. A carpenter gets 1 s. and a tailor 8 d. with
their victuals.  Servants wages are doubled within these
40 years.

*Summer, with men on day's wages, begins on 13th February, and
last 8 months.
