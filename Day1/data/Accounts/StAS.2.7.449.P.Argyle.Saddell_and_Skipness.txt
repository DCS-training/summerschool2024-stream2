                       SADDELL AND SK1PNESS.   449

       There is one at Aird of Carradale, which must have been of
      some importance. It is built on a high rock fronting the sea,
      whence it is inaccessible, and was defended on the land side by a
      broad and deep ditch.  It is 240 feet long, by 72 broad.  Nothing
      now remains but a portion of the outer wall.  About ` mile south-
      west from this, on a small peninsula, stand the ruins of a vitrified
      fort, of an ovoidal form, and still in a state of tolerable preserva-
      tion.  The peninsula itself is indented with abrupt rocks on all
      sides, and the wall of the fort is adapted to the elliptical form of
      the eminence.  Its circumference is about 150 yarjs, and its
      greater and less diameter 60 and 25 yards respectively.
        There are a few cairns or turnuli in the parish, similar in eba-
      racter to those usually met with in the Highlands.  One, at the
      burying-ground at a place called Brackley, is the largest in the
      district.  There is at Glenristle, near Claonaig church, a Druidi-
      cal circle, very entire, and of the usual formation.
        Land-owner,q.-There are six land-owners in the parish, viz.
      Captain Walter Campbell of Skipness; Mr Laueblan Macniel
      Campbell of Kintarbert; Mr Richard Campbell of Achnabreck;
      Mr John Campbell of Stonefield; Mr Alexander MacAlister of
      Torrisdale; Mr Keith MacAlister of Glenbarr.  Four of these
      are r"-ident, the other two have their seats in the adjoining pa-
      rishes.
        Parochial Registers.-There are two separate parochial registers
      kept in the parish, one for the Skipness and the other for the Sad-
      dell district, generally under the management of two of the school-
      rnasters.   Of late years they have been kept with great accuracy,
      but formerly they were much neglected, and a portion of them
      either lost or destroyed.        The date of the Skipuess register com.
      raences in the year 1783, and that of Saddell in 1746.
