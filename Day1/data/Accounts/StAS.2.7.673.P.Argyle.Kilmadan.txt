  Mansion-Houses.-The only mansion-houses in the parish are
those of Dunans, Glendaruell, and Ormidale.
  Antiquities.-Various traces of the invasion by the Danes still
exist in this parish. Rude cairns or tumuli can, at this day, be
pointed out ; and several very perfect stone coffins have, from
time to time, been discovered, in which, it is believed, the ashes
of their chiefs slain in battle were buried.

                          IV.-INDUSTRY.
  Agriculture.-The number of acres tinder cultivation, is 1301.
There are 19,527 mostly in moorland pasture. 975 acres are
under wood, a considerable portion of which is natural copse.
The planted wood consists chiefly of larch, which thrives re-
markably well, beautiful specimens of which are to be seen at
Dunans and Glendaruell. The late proprietors of Ormidale did
much to adorn that beautiful and romantic spot by planting; and
there is no place in the parish, in which all the different tribes of
firs thrive so well.
  Rent.-The average rent of arable land is L.1; and pasture,
2s. Real rental of the parish, L.3240.
  Of late years, a change has taken place in the system of agri-
culture throughout the parish. A more regular rot`tion of crop-
ping has been observed, with the modern system of furrow-draining.
The sheep pasture has been much improved by surface-draining,
which, combined with the inducements more recently held out by
a Pastoral Association formed in the district, has tended greatly
to improve the quality of all kinds of stock.
