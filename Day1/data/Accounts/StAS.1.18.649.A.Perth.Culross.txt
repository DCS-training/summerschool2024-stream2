     St Mungo.

   AT the east end of the town, on the sea cost, (the high
road only intervening,) there are the remains of a chapel
called St Mungo's chapel, of which the tradition is, that it
was on or near the place where St Mungo or Kentigern was
born.  He is said to have been the son of Eugenius the III.
King of the Scots, and a daughter of Lothus King of the
Picts.  His mother Thamit, when near the time of her deli-
very, in order to conceal her shame, threw herself into an
open boat, with a view to its being cast away, and, after
being, for some time, tossed about in the Firth, was driven
ashore, at or near the place where the chapel is situated,
and there brought forth her son.  There were two chaplains
for this chapel, who had their stipend paid out of some lands
in Strathern; but after the Reformation, these lands were
disponed by the crown, to the college of Glasgow.  St Mun-
go was educated at Culross, under the tuition of Servanus
or St Serf, who lived in an hermitage, in the place where
the monastery was afterwards built.
