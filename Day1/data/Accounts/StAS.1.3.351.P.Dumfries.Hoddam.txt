     of Hoddom.

   Curiosities.-Two places deserve to be mentioned, on ac-
count of their curiosity, and connection with antiquity.  The
one is the hill of Burnswark, famous for its particular form,
(which, from its smoothness and regularity, has all the appear-
ance of art), for the extensive view which may be distinctly traced
on the sides, and on the top of the hill*.  The other place
is Hallguards, being the place on which the old castle of
Hoddom stood, said to have been the seat of one of the fa-
milies of the Bruces.  This castle is said to have been de-
molished some centuries ago in compliance with the terms of
a border treaty.  It was rebuilt by Lord Kerses, in the days
of Queen Mary, but removed to a situation on the other side
of the Annan, where it now stands.  The history of this
castle, and also of the Tower of Repentance, will probably
be given in the account of the parish of Cumbertrees, to
which they belong.

   Church.-The living, including the stipend and the value
of the three glebes formerly mentioned, amounts to 100 L.
The manse is old, and in wretched repair.  The offices are
in good condition, having been very lately built.  The right
of presentation is vested in the Duke of Queensberry and Mr
Sharpe of Hoddom, who have exercised it by turns.

   School.-The schoolmaster's salary is only 6 L. 13 s. 6 d.
besides quarter wages, which have usually amounted to up-
wards of 10l. per annum.

nerary, in which is drawn a plan of the hill, and the works
upon it.
