the gradual removal of crofters from the more highly cultivated
portions of the parish, either to Aberdeen, where they are employ-
ed by the manufacturers, or to some other country district, the
barren patches which these persons have improved being (as their
leases expire) incorporated with the adjoining farms.
   There are no towns or villages in the parish.

   By a very accurate census taken in 1833, the population of this
parish was found to have decreased to 485 persons, chiefly in con-
sequence of the proprietors having ceased working the quarries.
Of these, 178 were under fifteen years of age.  By a census taken,
in 1839, the population was found farther decreased to 416.
   Character of the People.-The people, in general, possess a great
degree of sound sense, and perhaps even something of that sarcas-
tic shrewdness which has sometimes been ascribed as a characteristic
to the natives of Aberdeenshire.  At the same time, they rarely in-
terfere with subjects unconnected with their own private interests
and domestic duties.
   That they are a religious people is most satisfactorily ascertain-
ed by the moral respectability of their private conduct.  Crimes
cognizable by the civil authorities are unknown.  Drunkenness is
rare.  Charges of bastardy may at present be averaged at three in
about two years, and these are not unusually cases of relapse on
the part of the females,-a striking contrast to former times.  Dur-
ing the short space of eleven weeks at the end of the year 1645,
(about the very ddte which some have been pleased to esteem the
golden era of Scotland's religious history,) we find from the parish
records more crimes ofa licentious character, occasionally accom-

panied. by heavy aggravations, charged before the kirk-session, and
admitted by the parties, than have occurred during the last three
years!  The contrast is little less striking wben we compare the
