and some sheeting manufactured; but these articles afford
constant work for the weavers.  The inhabitants have been
long in the practice of wearing shoes made of coarse leather,
which go by the name of Forfar brogues, or black leather
shoes; the shoemaker, therefore, is able to accomplish all
the demands made upon him in his line, as these black
leather shoes are to be had in Brechin and Forfar, and in
most of the markets in the neighbourhood.  A day-labourer
receives 6 d. Sterling, and his meat per day, or 9 d. with-
out victuals.  In 1772, a day-labourer received 4 d. and his
meat; a wright receives 8 d. and his meat; and a tailor 6 d.
and his meat per day.  In 1772, a man servant's wages for
the half year was from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 1, 10 s.  Sterling, with
pasture for a score of sheep; his fee for the half year is now
from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3 Sterling.

   Rivers, Loch, and Fish.-The principal branches of the ri-
ver North Esk, which falls into the sea about 2 miles N. E.
from Montrose, take their rise in the parish; these are the
waters of Lee, of Mark, and of Tarf.  The water of Lee pas-
ses through the loch, from whence the parish takes the de-
signation of Lochlee.-Lochlee abounds with trouts,
eels, and char.  The trouts are generally of a large size, but
very poor, not only in the loch, but also in the water of
Lee, while it runs separately from the water of Mark; the
trouts in Mark and Tarf are clear and fat, but not so big as
in Lee.  The loch is a mile long, and about the fifth part of
a mile broad.

   Sheep, etc.-There are 9200 sheep, lambs included, 130
goats, 192 horses, and about 600 black cattle in the parish.
The horses and black cattle are small.  About 6000 of the
sheep are of the black faced kind; above 2000 are of a cros-
sed breed, obtained by keeping black faced rams with ewes
