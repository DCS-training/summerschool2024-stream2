	    PARISH OF EDROM.

PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

        THE REV. ALEX. CUTHBERTSON, MINISTER.

	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE ancient name of this parish was Aderham. It is
still called EtherhaM by the commonalty. Ader comes from the
Cambro-British word Awedur, signifying running water, and ham
in Anglo-Saxon, signifies a village. Aderham is thus the village,
on the banks of the Ader.
   Extent, Boundaries.-The extreme length of the parish is 71/2
miles; extreme breadth, 4 miles; mean length, 51 miles; mean
breadth, 21/2 miles; extent in square miles, 1312/10. * It is bounded
on the west by the parishes of Dunse, Langton, and Polwarth;
on the south by Fogo, Swinton, and Whitsome; on the east by
Hutton and Chirnside; and on the north by Buncle. The country
is generally flat.
  The climate in this part of the country is now very good. Ague,
which about forty years ago, before the practice of draining became
general, was very prevalent, is now never heard of.
   Hydrography.-There is a mineral well in this parish called the
Dunse Spa. It is situated in a valley which lies nearly a mile on
the south side of Dunse, on the estate of Nisbet. This well was
discovered accidentally in 1747. It was a place of very general
resort for a considerable time; but has long ceased to be so. A
very full account of the composition and virtues of this water has
been given by Dr Francis Home, in a treatise published in Edin-
burgh, 1751. The well, however, is now entirely out of repute.
There is likewise a mineral well on the estate of Blackadder, in a
ravine near the banks of the Blackadder, and not far from the bridge
on the eastern approach to Blackadder House from Allanton,-

<FOOTNOTE>I am indebted for this measurement, and for various other particulars relative
to the Blackadder and Whitadder, and the extent of arable land in the parish, woods,
&c. to Mr John Blackadder, land-surveyor, Blanerne, East Side.
