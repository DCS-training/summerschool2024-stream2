                PARISH OF NEWTYLE

    PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

          THE REV. JOHN MOON, MINISTER

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name, Boundaries, &c.-THE name of the parish in old re-
cords is Newtyld. Conjecture only is offered, that it may have
originated from the gray slates, tyle, or tyld, as they may have
been called, found in hills in the parish; a conjecture strength-
ened by the fact of a place near Dunkeld, where slate-quarries
are, having also the name of Newtyle. The parish is bounded
on the south, by Lundie; on the south-east and east, by Auch-
terhouse and Nevay, of the united parishes of Eassie and Nevay;
on the north and west, by Meigle and Kettins parishes.
  Topographical Appearance.-The parish is a convenient one in
its local arrangement, being rather more than two miles in direct
line from south to north, and nearly the same extent from east
to west. On the south, it is hilly. The hills are name Kil-
purnie, Hatton, Newtyle, Keillor, &c, and range chiefly from east
to west. They are not of great altitude, but verdant to their
tops, producing good pasture, and forming valuable sheep-walks.
The entrance to and outlet from Strathmofre (the great strath or
valley), in this direction, lies between the hills of Hatton and New-
tyle, commonly called the Glack of Newtyle. There is nothing
in the pass itself particularly calculated to arrest the attention;
but in coming northwards, the lover of landscape will be de-
lighted with the view, suddenly bursting open before him, of
the great and beautiful valley stretching far and wide below.
From the northern base of the hilly part of the parish on the
south, so its boundaries on the north, the general aspect is of flat
surface, gradually declining towards the level of the strath.
