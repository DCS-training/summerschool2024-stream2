     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Aughtergaven is situated in the shire of
Perth, within the bounds of the synod of Persh and
Stirling, and the presbytery of Dunkeld.  It is nine miles in
length from east to west, and about five miles in breadth
from north to south.  Its general surface measures above
12,000 acres Scotch; but a great proportion of this con-
sists of hills and muirs, or waste uncultivated ground.  A
small neighbouring parish, called Logiebride, had formerly
been annexed to Aughtergaven.  No accounts can be had of
the particular time when this annexation took place, from
tradition, or from the records of presbytery, in which the
parish is always named Oughter, or Aughtergaven*.  The
people residing in the districts that belonged to Logiebride
parish continue to bury in the churchyard at Logiebride.
A part of the church is yet standing, and is used as a bury-
ing-ground by the family of Tullybelton.  It is distant two
English miles from Aughtergaven church.  Above 50 years
