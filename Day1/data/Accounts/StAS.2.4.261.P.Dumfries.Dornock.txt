age yearly amount of contributions for the poor is L. 77, of which
L. ll arises from church collections, and the remainder from as-
sessments.
	Fuel.--The parishioners of a higher class are supplied with coal
brought hither by wherries or small vessels from Whitehaven an
Workington, and with excellent lime from Kelhead, the property
of the Marquis of Queensberry, a distance of six miles.

		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The intelligence and moral improvement of the population of
the parish, their increasing thirst for knowledge, and their ardent
desire for the proper education and instruction of their children,
are particularly worthy of rdmark. In particular, the morals nf the
people have been greatly improved by the cessation of smuggling,
which, about the beginning of the last century, was carried on to
a great extent,--the Isle of Man affording an easy opportunity for
the conveyance of contraband goods, chiefly brandy and tea.
	The general appearance of the parish, as it respects the improve-
ments made in its enclosures and hedges, also merits special atten-
tion. An old parishioner informed the present incumbent that,
eighty or ninety years ago, not a hedge was to be seen in the whole
district. Now the fields are duly enclosed, and hedges and hedge-
rows are everywhere seen, which beautify and adorn the fields and
pastures. Extraordinary advantages have also been derived from
the opening of the canal, and from the great improvement of the
parish roads.
