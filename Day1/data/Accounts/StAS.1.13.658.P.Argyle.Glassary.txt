     Statistical Accounts

   Diseases.-Coughs, and rheumatisms are frequent, particu-
larly among the lower class of people when advanced in 
years; which is not surprising, when the huts in which
they for the most part live, and the climate are considered.
The small-pox in former times used to carry off a number
of the children; but since inoculation generally prevailed,
which has been the cafe for upwards of 20 years, the dis-
ease is neither much dreaded, nor very mortal.  There are
sometimes very bad fevers among the lower class, com-
mencing generally in the spring months, which are spread
and continued by their visits and intercourse with one an-
other, and often prove very mortal.

   Rents.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 2532 Scots;
the real gross rent for the year 1793 about L. 5700 Ster-
ling.  There is only a small portion of the parish surveyed,
so that the rent the acre cannot be ascertained.  The heri-
tors have been very active for the last 20 years in meliora-
ting their property with march-walls, and enclosures, which
have greatly enhanced their value; for the tenants pay 
without a grudge 7 1/2 per cent. for any moment expended in
these improvements; which clearly point them to be the 
best mode of improving their country.  I must do them
the justice to say, that some of them have been very atten-
tive to beautify the parish by planting, for there are seve-
ral considerable belts, and clumps of various kinds of tim-
ber, planted on different parts thereof, which at present ex-
hibit a beautiful and agreeable variety to the traveller, and
will be a future fund of profit and advantage to the estates
wherein this improvement was adopted*.

cannot but regret the effect of entails upon two of the principal properties,
