                    UNITED PARISHES OF

             TINGWALL, WHITENESS, & WEESDALE.

         PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND.

             THE REV. JOHN TURNBULL, MINISTER.


             I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Boundaries.-THIS parish, consisting of the united parishes
of Tingwall, Whiteness, and Weesdale, is bounded on the north,
by the sea, and the parishes of Nesting and Delting; on the west,
by the sea, and the parish of Sandsting; on the south, by the sea
and Quarff; on the east, by Lerwick and Gulberwick. Lerwick
was disjoined from Tingwall, and erected into a separate parish,
in 1701. Sound and Gulberwick were disjoined from Tingwall in
1722, and annexed to the parish of Lerwick.
   Extent.-Tingwall is in length, from north to south, from 12
to 14 miles. Whiteness lies to the west of Tingwall, and is in
length from 5 to 6 miles. Weesdale is to the north-west of White-
ness, and from 6 to 7 miles in length.

                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Ancient Remains.-There are many tumuli, where the Scandi-
navians had buried their dead. In those which were lately opened,
earthen urns of various sizes were discovered, containing calcined
bones. Steinbartes, or stone axes, called here thunder-bolts, are
frequently found, also arrow-heads. There are also the remains
of a very great many Roman Catholic chapels.
   Tingwall was formerly an  archdeaconry. Most of the church
lands in it were made ever by Sir Jerome Cheyne, the Popish
Archdeacon of Tingwall, to his nephew, and remained in the fa-
mily, without, I believe, ever being challenged.
   In 1592, when Presbyterianism was established in Scotland,
Tingwall was the seat of, and gave name to, the Shetland Pres-
bytery; the meetings of which were afterwards removed to Scal-
loway.
   While the Shetland Islands remained under the Danish crown,
the Foud or chief magistrate resided here.
