rally employed in spinning coarse yarn, of which a kind of
cloth is made that gets the name of Osnaburgh.  Of this
the merchants in Dundee export large quantities; but in
this, as in most other manufactures, there is a very great
stagnation since the commencement of the present war.
They got 1 s. 6 d. for spinning a spindle of this yarn; but
since the war it has been so low as 1 s. and sometimes 10 d.
While the encouragement for spinning was high, it was
sometimes difficult for the tenants, and others, to get maid
servants.  But though their gain was considerable, yet the
constant sitting at the wheel, and the immoderate waste of
saliva, was by no means favourable to their health.  Many
of these people are employed in cutting down the corns in
harvest.  During this season they are uncommonly chear-
ful and healthy; but as this exercise in the field is an ex-
treme entirely opsosite to the sedentary life they gene-
rally lead through the rest of the year, disagreeable effects
are sometimes felt after the harvest; however, the dan-
ger of this is not a little abated by their present man-
ner of living during this season, which is upon oat bread
and ale, which, when fresh and good, is a most wholesome
diet.  How much preferable to that which was used some years
ago, viz. salt meat and salt broth, and sometimes, it is said,
milk and salt herring?  This, with their excessive labour,
could not fail to excite a most painful thirst; to quench
which, as soon as they came to the Land's End, as they call
it, they went in quest of cold water; of which, when within
their reach, having taken a plentiful share, they sat down
to rest, without reflecting on the danger they were in, which
it is said, has in some instances proved fatal.
