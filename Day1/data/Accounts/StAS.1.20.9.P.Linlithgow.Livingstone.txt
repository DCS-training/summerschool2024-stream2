Earth 8 inches deep.

Sod, inverted, 6 inches deep.

Vacuity 4 inches deep.

   Fig. 1.-From experience we cannot recommend this
drain, especially where the land has to undergo the opera-
tion of the plough; for it was found that the feet of the
cattle went down and deranged the billets which supported
the brushwood, and the drain soon became rather worse than
useless.
   Fig. 2. Is by much a better drain, but far from being un-
exceptionable.  It is made by means of a spades, each about
9 or 10 inces deep in the mouth, and sloping in the sides
so as to suit the figure.  The circular cavity at the bottom
is excavated by an instrument similar to a how, with a se-
micircular mouth.  This drain is adapted to a lawn where
heavy cattle are debarred.  By the turf being replaced, it
is scarcely, and but for a short while, perceptible at all;
while the brushwood, being supported by the shoulder above
the circular cavity, allows the water to filter freely from the
top and sides; but in a short time the brushwood must rot,
and the whole contents fall down.
   Fig. 3. Is liable to none of these objections, and is at the
same time by far the cheapest; it furnishes its own mate-
