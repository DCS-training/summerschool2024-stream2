   The first gathering is early in the month of May, in order
to mark and cut the ram-lambs; the second in the month of
June or July, to clip the wool; the third in August, to wean
the lambs from the ewes, and the fourth in October, to se-
parate the rams from the ewes.  The sheep that are sold,
are bought upon the spot by the butchers of Glasgow, and
the other neighbouring towns; and the tackmen wish to
manage matters so, that the butchers may take them away,
at the two last gatherings.  In this, however, they are  not al-
ways succesful; on the contrary, they are frequently obliged
to have other gatherings, merely for the butcher.  They ge-
nerally sell off about a third of their lambs, and always the
worst.  Their wedders they seldom keep more than three
years, though they are not in their prime till four or five;
but it is found more profitable to sell them when three years
old, than to keep them longer.  The year old sheep and the
rams are smeared; smearing preserves them from the scab,
and from vermin: it keeps them warm in winter, by occa-
sioning a continual perspiration, which prevents the snow
from lying upon them, in so much, that s smeared sheep may
easily be known in snowy weather by its not being covered
over with snow, like the rest of the stock.  The great quantity
of snow which lies upon a sheep, especially if it freezes upon
the animal, must be a very heavy load, and must greatly ob-
struct it in travelling, and in working for its meat, i. e. re-
moving the snow with its feet, in order to get at the herb-
age:  The smeared sheep are free fro, this inconveniency:
besides, smearing, when there is a proper quantity of butter or
oil made use of, is found to improve the quality of the
wool.

   The sheep which have been brought here from the lwo
country, are subject to a disease, called the braxy, which ap-
