                      V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   Market-town and Means of Communication.-Peebles is the
nearest market-town, and is four miles from the village of Eddle-
stone. There is a post-office in the village, and a daily post to
and from Edinburgh and Peebles. The length of the turnpike
roads in the parish is twenty-one miles, and a public coach from
Peebles to Edinburgh passes through the parish daily.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is the only place of
worship in the parish. It is situated two miles from the southern
extremity of the parish, and eight from the northern. More than
one-half of the population reside within a mile and a-half of it.
The greater part of those at the northern extremity either go to
the neighbouring church at Pennycuick, or to the dissenting meet-
ing-houses at Howgate and Bridge-end.
   The church was rebuilt in 1829, and contains accommodation
for 420 persons. Each heritor has a portion of the area allotted
to him in proportion to his valued rent, which he subdivides among
his tenants. The space occupied by the communion table is free
to all, and affords accommodation for 36 persons.
   The manse was built about fifty years ago. The late incumbent
received only L. 160 from the heritors, which was the estimated
expense for repairing the old manse. Out of his own funds, with
the addition of this sum, he built entirely the present manse and
offices. A large addition was lately made to the manse by the pre-
incumbent at his own expense, amonting to L. 380. The
extent of the glebe is 28 imperial acres, and may be estimated at
the yearly value of L. 30 Sterling. The stipend awarded by the
Court of Teinds in 1823 was 15 chalders of victual, half meal, half
