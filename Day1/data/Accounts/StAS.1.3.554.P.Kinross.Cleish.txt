     Ststistical Account

of which are in this parish, and in a very flourishing
state.  Mr Adam, len. was the first person, in the county
of Kinross, or neighbourhood, who planted potatoes in 
the fields; before that time, there were only a few rais-
ed in gardens; but not being able to obtain what he 
wanted for feed in this country, nor in the Edinburgh
market, he brought them over land from Carlisle.  Since
that time, the advantage of this useful root has been often
experience.  Upon a particular occasion, many of the poor
had scarcely any thing else to subsist on, for about 2 months,
after the old crop of corn was consumed, and before the
new crop was ready to be cut down.  Almost one half of 
the parish is already inclosed; and inclosures are increasing
fast.  The sences are partly stone dykes, and partly hedges.
The parish prossesses great advantages for inclosing, as hedges
thrive very well.  There is plenty of stone, and the ground
is well watered.

   Rent and Heritors.-The valued rent of the parish is 2703 L.
10 s. 10 2/1 d. Scotch.  The real land rent. when a process of 
augmentation was begun, in 1758, was estimated at 600 L.;
but this calculation was rather too low, and it was probably
700 L.  At present it is about 1430 L.  There are two meal
mills, valued at 30 L. a year; a bleachfield and lint mill at
25 L.; an inn and brewery at 20 L.; free stone quarries, 10 L.;
the annual produce of the wood is about 60 L.; rent of
houses, with gardens, not included in the land rent, about
50 L.; common arable and hay meadows, 10 s.; pasture,
about 5 s. per acre.  There are 19 heritors or proprietors of
land in the parish.  In 1744 there were 26.  Twelve reside
in the parish, 10 of whom farm their own lands.  None of
the principal heritors are residents.
