660			AYRSHIRE.

	The number of coal mines is three. One on Sundrum; an-
other on Gadgirth; and the third on Craighall or Auchencruive
estates. The yearly output from the whole is at the rate of 8333
tons. The coal varies in quality and price. Some sells at 10s.,
others at 9s. per ton, export prices. A ton consists of about 12
creels, or two single cart loads.
	The lime quarry on Drumsuy estate has produced for the last
few years, at the rate of 12,000 bolls, or 1090 tons annually. The
lime sells at 8d. per boll, or 7s. 4d. per ton.
	The expense of furrow-draining varies according to the dia-
tance to which the tiles or stones have to he carted, and in some
measure according to the nature of the soil. But in most instances,
after the tiles are laid down on the field, a fall of 18 1/2 feet, includ-
ing price of tiles, cutting and filling the drains, costs about 9d.

			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Ayr is the post-town and nearest market. It is six miles from
Coylton village, three miles from the north, and fourteen miles from
the south extremity of the parish. The chief part of the produce is
sold in Ayr. But Maybole and Old Cumnock, each about ten miles;
and Tarbolton and Mauchline, the former six, the latter nine miles
distant, afford, in their periodical fairs, other facilities for trade.
