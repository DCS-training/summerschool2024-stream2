the parish of Inchcalloch, are now annexed, quoad omnia, and
the lands of Bannachrae, belonging properly to the parish
of Row, are considered as annexed, quoad sacra, to that of
Luss.

   Soil, Surface, Climate, Longevity, and Diseases.-The soil is
in general light and gravelly, but in some parts there is good
loam.  The principal level land lies near Lochlomond, and
chiefly where the rivers discharge themselves into it, formed
probably in the course of ages, by the sand and soil carried
down from the higher grounds by the torrents.  Scarcely one
twelfth of the surface is arable.  The greatest part is hilly
and mountainous.  The climate is mild and temperate.  Snow
seldom lies many days on the low grounds.  In severe win-
ters, the degree of cold has been found to be considerably
greater near Glasgow and Edinburgh than in this country.
Hollies, and other plants in the hedges and gardens, have
there been killed by the frost, when here they remained un-
hurt.  The mountains and woods break the force of the
winds in every direction; and the exhalations from that part
of the lake which never freezes, may perhaps likewise serve
to temper the atmosphere.  The air, though often moist, is
remarkably healthful.  Many of the people live to a great
age.  The venerable list of old persons, in the little village of
Luss, in 1769, is well known*.  A man who resided in it
