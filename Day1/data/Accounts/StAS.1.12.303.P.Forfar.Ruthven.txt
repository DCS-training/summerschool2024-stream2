track of imperfect agriculture, and seldom seeking beyond
daily subsistence.  Yet those who have lived to experience the 
wonderful change which half a century has produced, do not
say that they were formerly unhappy; satisfied with little,
if none of them were rich, neither were there any really poor.
Their great dependence at that time was upon their sheep, of
which they bred and maintained considerable numbers.  af-
ter the separation of the crop from the ground, the fields be-
came then a kind of common pasturage, until the ensuing feed-
time; but upon the introduction of sown grass and turnip, it
became necessary to put away the sheep; and there are now
only a very few for private use.  The whole of the wool
was manufactured in the parish into a kind of coarse wool-
len cloth, with part of which the farmer clad himself and
family; the remainder was sold to help to pay the rent.  All
the flax which was the raised, and which, like the wool, was
considerable in quantity, but more so in quality, was manu-
factured in the parish for home consumption, or sold in yarn.
The following table, from good information, may serve to give
a comparative state of this parish, and even throw some light
on the state of other parishes, not only at the period alluded
to, but for a long time back.-Note: 50 years are mentioned, 
because some authentic documents refer to that period.  No al-
teration whatever was observed here, until about 35 years
ago.  In the first column in the article Servants Wages, there
are some perquisites called bounties, amounting from 5 s. to
10 s. yearly, not included; in the second column all these
perquisites are included.
