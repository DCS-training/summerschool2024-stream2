most part of the parish is well supplied with fuel from thence,
except perhaps a few places lying at the greatest distance
from the moss, and where the roads are very bad.  In many
mosses, there are roots of old fir trees dug up, which serve for
light in the winter nights.  From this, it would appear that
the hills have formerly been covered with fir.  Often large fir
trees quite fresh and found, and of considerable length, have
been dug up, and when split, they are useful for rafters ha
building houses, and lair very long.

   Sea Weed.-There is very little sea weed for manuring the
land.  A very little kelp is made once in three years, on the
shore of one estate.  However, the small short sea weed is of
use for feeding cattle in winter, and is reckoned very whole-
some.

   Black Cattle.-There is a great number of black cattle in
the parish, every small tenant having his proportion, general-
ly as many as his provender can support during the winter, is
he is not in straitened circumstances.  In that case, he takes
cattle from others, who have more than they can feed, at
the rate of 2 s., 2 s. 6 d., or 3 s., through the winter and spring,
as provender is plentiful or scarce.  The black cattle are
mostly of a small hardy kind, and may now, at an average,
fetch, when fold to drovers, from 2 L. 10 s. to 3 L. Sterling.
Some cattle, belonging to gentlemen, are of a larger size, and
greater value, and may be a mean of mending the breed of
cattle among the common people.  The people depend prin-
cipally on the black cattle for paying their rents.

   Horses and Sheep.-The number of horses was taken a few
years ago, and all the horses, young and old, amounted to
1531.  There are several farms in the west end of the parish
