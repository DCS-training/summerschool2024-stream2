   Climate- The climate of this country in general is very
damp; we have no great snows in winter, but a vast quan-
tity of rain, and what is here called fleet, i.e. wet snow.
Neither are our frost so severe as in England.  In the 
year 1744, the Thames freezed of 17 1/2 inches thick, and
ice here at that time did not exceed 9 inches.  Before traf-
fick and commerce were introduced, this remote corner was 
the most healthy spot in the kingdom.  There was one
man that reached his 140th year; he married in his roodth,
and in the year that he died, pulled ashore alone in his
small skiff in very severe weather; and within these 20
years there died a man in North Yell parish, aged 120; 
at present there is one man in Fetlar, aged 93, and some
few more above 90.  But these are rare aves.  Traffick
produces riches, and riches luxury, and luxury disease;
and maladies of every kind prevail here perhaps with
more violence than any where upon the Continent.  But 
within these 20 years by-past, the great Giver of every
good and perfect gift to mankind, has been pleased to vouch-
safe this poor land one of the most merciful discoveries ever
bestowed upon sinful mortals, (the sending of a Savior ex-
cepted), I mean inoculation, which is here practiced with 
very great success.  Besides the small-pox, fevers of divers
kinds prevail amongst us, particularly intermittents, which, 
though long kept under by the use of the bark, rarely fail
to land either in dropsies or consumptions.  The leprosy
rarely makes its appearance in this ministry; for these 200
years by past, there has been only one set apart*.
