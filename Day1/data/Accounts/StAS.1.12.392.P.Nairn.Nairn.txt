ple to reside here.  But the prices of provisions of every kind 
having risen greatly of late, and the moss being almost entire- 
ly exhausted, have contributed to increase the number of men-
dicants who insest the place, and added considerably to the 
poor's roll.  Besides the bridge before mentioned, there are 
two other great disadvantages, which bear hard upon the town 
and country, and these are, the want of some manufacture, 
and the want of a pier.  Both these might, it is supposed, be 
removed at no very considerable expense, and to the great e-
molument of Nairn and the neighbourhood.  By altering the
present course of the river, many people say that a pier might 
be built, capable of receiving ships of considerable burthen. 
Were a spirit of improvement once introduced, either a linen 
or a woollen manufacture might be established, which, if well 
conducted, would add greatly to the advantage of proprietors 
of shares, and to the country in general.  The number of peo- 
ple who apparently want employment in the town and its 
vicinity, is absolutely incredible.  If industry, which in a  
great measure seems to be dormant, were aroused, there is 
little doubt but Nairn might become a flourishing place.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people, in general, are

ordinances of divine institution, and rational, without an over-
heated zeal, or too much coldness in their religion.  Those 
of the Established Church, some few of the Episcopalian per- 
suasion, and the Antiburgher Seceders, live in good terms 
with one another.  *Few persons from this parish have been
