applies for this purpose, occasions as hard a pull to the horses
as if the plough was of a heavier make.  If two or three hor-
ses or oxen be yoked in the harrows, there is a person ap-
pointed to lead each horse or ox.  Sometimes the horses,
and sometimes the women, carry out on their backs, in creels
made of straw, called casies, the dung to the fields.  Though
the post goes weekly South and North through these parishes
of Ronaldsay and Burray, yet there never was a road made
in either.  Of consequence few carts are used.  It is no un-
common thing to see six persons with six horses, carrying to
the mill three bolls of bear.
   The tenants in general are tenants at will.  South Ro-
naldsay belongs to 33 different proprietors, few of whom re-
side in it.  In the mixture of their property, there is a kind
of regular confusion, which bids defiance to inclosures, and
stifles the very idea of improvement.  In winter, the horses
and cattle wander through, and poach the fields, and many
hundreds of hogs are digging holes and ditches in them, and
in the meadow ground, by night and by day.  Some farm-
ers in Burray sowed some of their fields about two years a-
go with oats, without any other ploughing than what they
received from the notes of the hogs.  And they were of o-
pinion, that as it was a light sandy soil, they had a better crop,
and fewer weeds, than if they had turned it up with the
plough.  The season for sowing oats is generally in April,
for bear in May; and they are reaped in September and Oc-
tober.  Amidst all the errors in farming already mentioned,
there is one practice in harvest prevails in these parishes,
which the writer gladly begs leave to recommend to the at-
tention of those in the Highlands of Scotland, or wherever
the crop is in danger of being rotted by rain; and it is this:
every sheaf, after it is cut, is bound, and set on its end, in a
hind of triangular position, the crop broke gently down; if
