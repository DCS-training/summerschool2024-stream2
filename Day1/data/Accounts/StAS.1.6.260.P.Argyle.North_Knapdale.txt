north of Ireland, in a clear day, may be also distingueshed, and
especially the island of Rathlin.
   Between the islands and the main land, the tide runs with
a velocity incredible to stranger.  Between Jura and Scarba,
the space is about one mileover, in this narrow strait.  Three
currents, formedby the islandd and mainland, mett a fourth, which
sets in from the ocean; the conflux is druadful, and spurns all de-
scription: even the genius of Milton could not paint the horror of
the scene.  At the distance of 12 miles, a most dreadful noise, as if
all the internal powers and been let loose, is heard.  By the con-
flictosthse inanimate heroes, who will not yield, though highting
twice a-day since the foundation of the world, an eddy is form-
ed, which would swallow up the largest ship oftheline: but at
full tide these combatants take a little rest; and, when they
are asheep, the smallest bark may pass with impunity.  This
gulf is calle Cory-vreckan.
   From this scene, turning to the N. one beholds the hill or
Cruachan, the highest in Argyleshire, and among the highest
in Scotland.  This mountain looks like the fovereign of all the
rest.  Even in the month of June, he does not put off his
snowy night -cap.  The other hills, to the number of feveral
hundreds, in comparison looke like mole-hulls.   Upon the face
of this landscape, a great many lakes spangle to the sun beams,
and form a prospect truly romantic.  The largest is Lochow,
about 20 miles in length, and 3 in bredth.  This lake abounds
with plenty of the finest salmon; and what is uncommon, the
seal comes up from the ocean, through a very rapid river, in
quest of this fist; and retires to the sea at the approach of
winter.
