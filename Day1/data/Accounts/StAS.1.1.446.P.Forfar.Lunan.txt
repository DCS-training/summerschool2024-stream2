17: 5; but the representative of that family is still titular of
the teinds.  From that period, to 1781, the right of present-

tenance of the poor, and other purposes to which parish
funds are usually applied.  The number on the poor's roll
has been generally from four to fix; but, from 1783 to 1799,
there were eight; and consequently, during that period, the
