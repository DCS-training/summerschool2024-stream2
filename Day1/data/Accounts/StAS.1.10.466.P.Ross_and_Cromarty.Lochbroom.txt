the quantity of fish, cured at all these three places taken to-
gether, is usually little more than the two last.

   Roads and Bridges.-There was an excellent road betwixt
Ullapool and the town of Dingwall, commenced in summer
1792, and it is now nearly finished; so that, where lately
nothing could be carried but in creels on horseback, carts
and carriages can now travel with the greatest ease and expe-
dition.  This road consists of 38 miles, and has coast govern-
ment about 4500 L. including bridges, of which there must
be a good many in its course.  We are informed that similar
roads art soon to be made to different other parts of the
Highlands; which are indeed highly necessary.  Perhaps a
few cross roads would be also proper; particularly one from
Ullapool to Pollew, which lies about 30 miles south-west of
it.  And if this road was farther extended from Pollew to
Lochcarron, by the shortest cut that could be contrived, it
would be of vast service to the West Highlands in gene-

opened from one parish to another; and the good effects of
such a road would not only be felt all theway from Loch-
broom to Glenelg, but would also extend further, to Sky and
the Long Island.  Another cross road from Ullapool to Assint,
on the north, would be likewise very useful.

   Manufactures, Minerals, Fuel, etc.-No manufactures

that could employ a great number of people, is vehemently
desired.  Some think that a leap manufacture would be much
to the purpose; but the general voice is in favour of a wool-
