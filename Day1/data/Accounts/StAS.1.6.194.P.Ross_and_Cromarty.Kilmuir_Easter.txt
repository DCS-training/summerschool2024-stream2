puted that there are about 800 black-cattle, 300 horses, and
about 900 sheep in the parish.  A third of the black cattle, are
what is commonly called here, true Highlanders; the rest
either have been introduced into the parish from Fife and Aber-
deen, or are a cross breed between these and the Highland
bull:  these last are by far the best cattle in the parish, and by
all appearane will prevail.-The breed of horses has been
greatly improved of late years; but the small hardy Highland

but, though all these are inhabitants of the parish, it is proper
to observe, that there are not many of each kind*.

stood the ruins of a Romish chapel on a pleasant bank, surrounded with graves.
This spot has been deserted as burying place for many years; and the pre-
sent farmer (not adverting to the impropriety of such a measure) carried away
all the stones to build his farm houses, and the rubbish to meliorate his land;
and ploughed up the burying ground, with an intention to make it an addition
to a corn field.  The present incumbent, having heard of this species of sacri-
lege, visited the spot, and found it covered with the bones of the dead, turned
up with the plough.  The indelicacy of his conduct was represented to the farm-
er; and he was persuaded to collect the reliques, and to deposit them again in
the earth; and he solemnly engaged to draw lines round the sacred spot, to
