ern exposure, render it peculiarly well calculated for grass.
The air is rather moist.  This appears to be owing to the ex-
posure of the parish; to its vicinity to the hills, and the low
wet ground to the north.  The inhabitants, however, being
sober, and a good deal employed in the open air, are, in ge-
neral, healthy.  They are not peculiarly liable to any disease
except the rheumatism:  Young persons, however, are sel-
dom affected by it, and few in a violent degree.  This dis-
temper seems to be owing principally to the dampness of the
air and the houses.  The dampness of the houses is occa-
sioned, in a great measure, by the water which soaks through
the ground, in its passage from the hills to the valley.  This
inconvenience might be remedied, by chosing proper situa-
tions for houses, and cutting drains to intercept the water
from above.

   Lakes, Rivers, and Spring, etc.-There are 4 lakes among
the hills:  The largest about a mile and a half in circumfe-
rence; the other 3 much smaller.  The fish found in them
are pike, perch, and eels, with some trouts.  The stream
which runs from these lakes drives 2 mills; and there is a
sufficient fall for driving several more.  The river Gairny
is the boundary of the parish on the north, for more than 2
miles: It falls into Loch Leven.  Its fish are small trouts,
produced by the trouts of Loch Leven, which come up the
rivers to spawn in the floods in autumn.-The parish is ex-
ceedingly well watered; there are a great number of excel-
lent springs, which rise in different places, from the bottom
of the hills down to the low grounds.  There is scarcely a
house which is not either near a spring, or has a rivulet run-
ning by it.  In some of these springs the the thernometer stands 
at 42degree; but in the greatest part at 45degree.
