JAMES ERSKINE, of Cardross, Esq. is patron.  The manse is
situated a little N. of the church, is surrounded with trees in
full growth, and has a most delightful prospect of the adjacent
country and the windings of the Forth.  It was built about
the beginning of this century, and covered with heath, until
1747, when 2 1/2 feet were added to its height, and covered with
grey slate.  It was repaired in 1790.  The stipend is, a glebe
of about 4 acres of ground, including the garden, and the
stance of the manse and offices; 1 L. 13 s. 4 d. for grass, 2 chal-
ders of meal, 1 chalder of barley, 41 L. 13 s. 4 d. in money, and
3 L. 6 s. 8 d. for communion elements.

   Schools and Poor.-There is a school, with a school-house
and garden.  The salary is 5 L. 7 s. 2 1/12 d.; and the dues of re-

fees, which are considerably higher than any in the neigh-
bourhood, may amount to 50 L. a year, exclusive of the house
and garden.  There are two private schools in the parish.
The parish funds, which are inadequate for supplying the poor,
arise from a yearly voluntary donation from one of the heri-
