   It is pleasant to observe the progressive state of civilization
in the Highlands of Scotland, and in this place in particu-
lar, compared with the ferocity and barbarity of the last cen-
tury.  Then, a Swedish vessel of considerable size, happen-
ing to east anchor in Kyles-cuin, attracted the rapacious
attempts of some young men in the neighbourhood; who, to
the number of 12, boarding her in the night with blackened
faces, shot the captain in his cabin, mastered the crew, wound-
ing such as resisted, and then carried off all they covered of
the goods, leaving the remaining part of the hands to sail off
with their ship Next year, another ship appearing on the coast,
and continuing to hover nearer land than any of the beholders
could understand the meaning of, a number of men from the
shore, observing her motions, took a boat, and made towards
her; but approaching pretty near, saw sevearl men from the
ship jumping into the long boat, armed with muskets and o-
ther weapons; and so, not liking their appearance, thought
best to sheer off wtih all speed towards the shore; but, finding
themselves pursued by the long boat, and ready to be overtaken,
they landed upon the first island they came to, but in landing
received the fire of several muskets, by which one man was slain,
who cried out as he was dying, "I have got what I delerv-
ed," meaning his having killed the captain of the Swedish ves-
sel, for he it was sho shot him.  Upon this, the long boat re-
turned, and the vessel failed off.

   Disadvantages.-1. The want of arable ground for produ-
cing corn.  With the best seasons, the crops raised in this pa-
rish will hardly be sufficient for two-thirds of the inhabitants;

country, and where they were not wholly destroyed till of late.
