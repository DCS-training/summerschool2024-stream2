15 miles distance from Inverness, and nearly half way to
Fort-Aagustus.  from Inverness to Drumnadreochid, where
the inn is built, carriages of all kinds travel with safety;
from thence the road is carried on To Fort-Augustus, but
this part of it is not yet sufficiently broad for carriages.
The road is continued from Drumnadreochid to Corri-
mony, at the head of the valley of Urquhart: it is fit for car-
riages, and kept in good repair.  2. Another great road
from Beauty to Fort -Augustus passes through Urquhart, and
meets the Inverness road at Drumnadreochid.
   The road from Inverness to Drumnadreochid was made
at a very great expence, through the rocks of Aberrachan,
which in several places required to be blown and cut with
iton tools.  This was perhaps one of the greatest underta-
kings ever attempted in the Highlands, by a private Socie-

through Glenmorishton, viz.  The military road from Fort-
Augustus to bernera, which has for several  years past fallen
into great disrepair, being totally neglected by Government.
The other great road is that from the foot to the head of 
Glenmorstston, which, for want of funds, has never yet been
completed, but is vry passable for travellers on horseback
This parish has to uphold, and keep in repair, above 50
miles of public, besides cross roads; and the fund for this
purpose arises from the commutation of the statute-labour,
as 2 5. from each male above 15 years of age, and which
amounts to about L. 50, and an assessment of one penny
Sterling in the pound Scots of valued rent, amounting to
L. 9. : 4 : 11 : this fund is small, but being managed with
great care and economy, does wonders.
   The road from Inverness to Glenelg, along the west side
of Lochness, has been surveyed by order of Lord Adam
Gordon, Commander in Chief in Scotland, and an estimate
