quarter. It was during this comparatively brief space that by
far the largest proportion of the buildings referred to was con-
structed; and although occasional seasons of prosperity have since
occurred, to give a further impetus to this, the staple trade of the
district, the five years referred to may, with safety, be mentioned
as the period during which it was prosecuted with more uninter-
rupted success than has ever since been the case.
   But this very prosperity, in the end, proved the fruitful source
of wide-spread calamity. To meet the increasing trade of the
town and suburbs, a native bank was established in Arbroath, con-
temporaneous with which, an agency, from an Edinburgh bank,
was opened, which, added to the two previously existing, presented
the formidable number of four banks to a population, including
the environs, of about 10,000 souls. Naturally anxious to do bu-
siness, and to participate in the profits of such apparently unex-
ampled prosperity, as that which everywhere met the eye, the
utmost facility and accommodation were afforded by the banks to
almost every class of customers,-an unhappy feature, during
prosperous times, of the banking system of the country in general,
and which has not unfrequently led to the most disastrous results.
The consequences were, in this place as elsewhere, that a number
of individuals, destitute of capital, embarked in trade to an un-
warrantable extent; and towards the close of 1825 and beginning
of 1826, when the memorable panic in London convulsed the
whole commercial community, its effects were experienced here
with overwhelming severity, enguiphing in one common ruin, not
merely the speculator and adventurer, but many who for years
had deservedly borne a character of unquestioned respectability,
-a melancholy illustration of the instability of a commercial life,
and a dear-bought warning to one and all, to avoid the fatal effects
of over-trading.
   Nor has the warning been unavailing. The recollection of that
disastrous period has never ceased to retain and to exhibit its sa-
lutary effects, as well in the administration of the banking business
of the district* as on the whole body of merchants and manufac-
turers; and hence it is that, during the last four or five years,
while the neighbouring town of Dundee has been a prey to the
baneful effects of a system similar to that which, in 1826, pro-

<FOOTNOTE>It is here deserving of remark that, while in 1825-26 there were four banks to
a population of about 10,000, there are at present, and have been since than last-men-
tioned year, only three banks to a population now increased to 15,000.
