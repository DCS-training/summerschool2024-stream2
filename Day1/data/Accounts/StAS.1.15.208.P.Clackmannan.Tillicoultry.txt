a stable, and the old glebe is an orchard.  The stipend con-
sists of 120 L. Scotch, including communion-element money,
34 bolls of oats, 24 bolls of barley, and 6 bolls of meal.  It
commenced in the year 1648, and since that time there has
been no augmentation.  The minister has the privilege of
getting his coals for paying tire collier the price of working,
and he has also property in the hills, for maintaining 7 or 8
sheep.  The glebe was exchanged in the year 1730, when
the manse was removed to its present situation.  It lies in
different pieces, and ought to consist of 13 acres.

   School,-There is a parochial schoolmaster, whose salary is
100 L. Scotch.  He has also a dwelling house and garden.
His annual income, including salary, and all emoluments,
both as school master and session clerk, is extremely small,
and seldom exceeds 20 L. Sterling.  The school is kept in the
Westertown, which is by no means centrical or convenient
for the rest of the parish.  The school wages are low, and
English, writing, and arithmetick are taught for 2 s. per
quarter, English alone being only 1 s. 3 d.

   Poor.-The poor are maintained without any assessment,
and there are no beggars.  The capital of the poor's money
is 212 L. Sterling, and the annual average collection at the
church door, has been about 12 guineas, for 18 years past.
The interest of the capital, together with the collections,
and the profits arising from the mortcloths, proclamations of
marriages, and incidental fines, constitute the funds by which
the poor are maintained.  The number of persons at present
statedly supplied from the public charity is 7.  But, besides
these, the kirk session occasionally assists a great many more,++
