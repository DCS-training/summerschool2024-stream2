I can receive, there may be from 20 to 25 more baptized
in the parish each year.

   Burials.-There is no register of burials kept by the
session; I have, however, requested the present sexton, since
he entered on his office, to mark accurately every burial in
the church-yard, and to keep a book for that purpose, that
he may know when it is proper to open a grave where a
corpse has formerly been laid down.  This register, of which
I keep a copy, is now before me; and from the 20 th Janu-
ary 1773 to the 20 th January 1795, there have been bu-

eleven years during this period, there were buried 672,
average 61; for the last eleven 753, average each year 68.
This, however, does not accurately state the number of
deaths in this parish; many strangers are buried here, and
many are carried out of this place to other places.  The
sexton however, assures me, there are more carried out of
this parish than brought hither, owing to the number of
new inhabitants who reside in the town of Peterhead.

   Small-pox.-In 1774; I find there were 72 burials: of this
number 27 died of the small pox: in 1781, there were 86
burials, and of this number 34 died of the same disorder.
Inoculation has been introduced here for these last 25 years;
but the practice is far from being general.

   Marriages.-It is still more difficult ta ascertain the num-
ber of marriages. I have kept for severaI years a list of
persons I have married; but this only happens when the
bride resides in this parish, and is a member of my congre-
gation; I have a note before me from the clerk, from the
22 d of May 1791 to the 1 st of March 1794, of proclama-
tions during that period, they amount to 84; so that at an
