     of Logie Buchan.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-  The living consist of 5 chal-
ders of victual, halt meal, half bear, L. 24, 8 s. Sterling,
and a glebe of about 5 acres.  The present manse was built
in 1775, an the church in 1787.  There ae 7 heritors,
of whom only Mr Buchan of Auchmacoy, the patron, re-
sides in it.-  As this parish is divided by the Ythan, in the
manner above mentioned, scholars could not easily pass the
river to a school situated on any  one side of it.  Many
years ago, therefore, a schoolmaster was placed on each
side of the water, and the salary, which is only 100 merks
Scots, and the other perquisites, were equally divided be-
tween them.  But from this division of the emoluments,
which was intended for the accommodation of the parish,
both sides of the water are in fact deprived of the benefit
of a schoolmaster; the encouragement being to small, that
no person qualified for teaching, can accept of it.-  There
is no parochial fund for the support of the poor, except the
weekly collections, which amount, upon an average, to a-
bout L. 12 Sterling yearly; and even this small sum is
sufficient for the poor, as I have seldom known the num-
ber on the roll to exceed 5 or 6.-There is only I alehouse,
kept at the lint-mill, for the accommodation of those who
bring their lint from a distance, to be dressed at it.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Among the advantages
of this parish, may be mentioned, that the soil in general
is very improvable.  I do not suppose there aer 20 acres
in the whole parish, that may not be improved to advan-
tage, considering the easy access that there is to lime, by
means of the Ythan, the most distant parts of the parish
not having above 4 English miles of land carriage.  The
navigation of this river also affords easy access to coals for
fuel, which is a matter of the utmost importance to this
parish, as there is no moss in it, and the mosses in the neigh-
