in the same quarter. The ruins of one are to be seen on an
inland hill, Dun Borreraig, with walls twelve feet thick, and fifty-
two feet in diameter inside, and having a stone seat two feet high
round the area.  As usual, there is a gallery in the midst of the
wall.  Another had occupied the summit of Dun Aidh, a large,
high, and almost inaccessible rock near the Mull."

                               IV.-INDUSTRY.

   Agriculture.--
The number of acres, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 15,000, Scots
 measure.
About 18,000 acres are constantly waste or in pasture.
A large proportion of these 18,000 acres might be cultivated with a profitable ap-
  plication of capital.

   The present proprietor has planted to a large extent, and con-
tinues to do so.  There were few or no planted trees, till he suc-

   Rent.-Arable land may be stated at from 15s. to L.1 per
acre; grass land from Is. to L.1. The farms are not let by mea-

   The real rental of the parish is L.8400.
   The pasture lands have been much improved of late years by
surface drains. Furrow-draining has also been carried on in the
arable land. A tile-work has lately been erected for making
drain-tiles. In short, the tenants are encouraged in every way
to improve their lands by draining and liming,-the landlord
bearing the expense, in most cases, of opening the drains.
  A local Agricultural Society has been established for some years,
and prizes are awarded for the improvement of the breed of black-
cattle and sheep, and for the encouragement of green crop hus-
bandry among the small tenants.
  The only manufacture is distilling, which is carried on to a
considerable extent in the island.  There are three distilleries
in this parish,-Lossit, Talant, and Bowmore, producing above
