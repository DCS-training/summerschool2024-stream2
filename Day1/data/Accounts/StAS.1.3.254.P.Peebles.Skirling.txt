     PARISH OF SKIRLING.

     (County of Peebles.)

     Situation, Extent, Surface.

   THIS parish lies in the county of Tweedale, or Peebles.
The western bounderies of the parish are also the 
boundaries of the shire.  It is the presbytery of Biggar,
and synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.  It is two miles and
a half long, and nearly the same in breadth.  The general
appearance of the surface is uneven.  We have no moun-
tains; but there are three small green hills in the parish.
On part of two farms there is some short heather.  The soil
is fertile, though generally light.  Being much above the 
level of the sea, the air is pure and wholesome.  Owing to our
high situation, the crops are often damaged by frosts, which
sometimes set in about the middle of August.  The house
of Skirling appears, by the vestiges of the walls, to have
been large.  It was surrounded by a morass or bog, ex-
cept a small space on the south-west side, and that was de-
sended by turrets.  The entry to the house was by a bridge
of stone over this bog.

   Fairs.-We have four annual fairs here; the first on the
Tuesday before the 12th of May; the second on the 3 d
