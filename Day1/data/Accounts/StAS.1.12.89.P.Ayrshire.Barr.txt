     Of Barr.

   I shall only add as a further proof of the experiment of the
Cheviot breed of sheep taking place in this parish, and of their
doing well, the farmer, whole property they are, is resolved
to bring upon the same farm, this ensuing season, some scores
more; and it is hoped others will see it their interest to fol-
low the example to purchase into their respective farms a
number of the Cheviot breed, less or more, as is most answer-
able.  Perhaps it might not be advisable to change the whole
stock of the short sheep at once; but by degrees, in this way,
there can be no risk.  Even bringing in rams of the Cheviot
breed, and crossing them with the ewes of the short sheep;
would greatly improve the wool of the parish.
