     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF GLADSMUIR.

     (County of East Lothian.-Presbytery of Haddington.-
     Synod of Lothian and Tweedale.)

     By the Reverend Mr GEORGE HAMILTON.

     Origin and Name.

   THE church of Gladsmuir was built by Baillie of Lam-
mington, in the year 1695, and the parish was then
formed by annexations from the contiguous parishes, Tra-
nent, Hadington, and Aberlady.  The etymology of the
name offers nothing worth enquiry; it probably arose from
the number of glades (kites), which frequented this parish
in its barren state, and are yet not unfrequent in the neigh-
hourhood.

   Soil and Climate.-Between the Frith on the north, and
the banks of the Tyne on the south, the country rises gently
to a ridge, on the summit of which the church is placed.
The top of this ridge, which was long an open muir, was
for ages robbed of its soil, being incessantly pared of its turf
by the neighbouring inhabitants; it is now, therefore, clayey,
shallow, and barren; but the soil becomes more fertile as you
descend on either side.  The air is pure, dry, and healthy,
and epedemical distempers accordingly are rare.
