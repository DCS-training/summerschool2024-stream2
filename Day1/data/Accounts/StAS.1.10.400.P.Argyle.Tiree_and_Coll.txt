   Minerals.-Hard whinstone prevails in this parish, yet
there is frequently ironstone and granite, and in one farm
abundance of limestone and marble.  The qualities of the Ti-
ry marble are now well known; it is sometimes pure white;
sometimes red and white, or white and green; and some-
times variegated with numberless figures.  It is to be hoped
a correspondence will be continued, a market procured, and
at marble work carried on.-There is also a lead mine at
Crossapol in Coll.

   Animals.-The hill of Ceanmharra, the west point of Tiry,
is very remarkable for a great number of large natural caves,
frequented, in time of hatching, by innumerable flocks of sea-
fowls.  The height of some of the caves 160 feet, the sea
bellowing in below, and thousands of fowls, with discordant
notes crouding upon the cliffs, form a hideous scene.  In
either magnificent caves, the raven, the hawk, or the eagle,
build their losty nests.  Separate from all these, the pigeons
have chosen their habitations: Hither their enemy, at the risk
of his life, descends a very unpleasant stair, carrying fire and

ting them, they fly into the flames attached to the light, ap-
parently the passage to escape; thus numbers of them are
caught.  At the distance of 6 leagues westward from this
hill, lie a cluster of unhospitable rocks, called Sceir-mhor, to
which young adventurers before sun rising in a calm summer
day, go in quest of sport.  The skins the sea-calves, the
old inhabitants of these rocks and feas, which they kill with
clubs or bullets, commonly measure from six to eight feet
in length.
   Three sorts of wild geese frequent these isles.  About the
beginning of April, they all go off to places of greater securi-
ty and shelter for hatching,  return as soon as their young
