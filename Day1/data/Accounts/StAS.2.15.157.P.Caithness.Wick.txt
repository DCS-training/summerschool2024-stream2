      Villages.-The village of Broad Haven, which is a fishing station
    with 170 inhabitants, is about a mile along the northern shore
    from Wick. A mile farther on, is that of Staxigoe, not far from
    Castle Girnigoe, containing 261 inhabitants. It is a place of
    some antiquity. Two store-houses of the Earls of Caithness, built
    250 years ago, are still standing there and in good order. They
    contain 4 meal-girnels, each girnel capable of holding 1000 bolls-
    of meal; and 4 lofts, each capable of containing 1000 bolls of bear.
    These were necessary when rents were paid in kind. Staxigoe is
    another fishing station, with a tolerably good natural harbour for
    boats. The village of Sarclet, on the estate of Thrumster, lies
    about five miles to the south of Wick. It is situated on the top
    of a small bank overhanging a small cove, wbi6b, at considerable,
    expense, has been converted into a pretty good harbour for fish-
    ing-boats.
       Means of Communication.-Wick is a post-town. In 1829 the
    revenue of the post-office amounted to L.1200 a-year. A daily
    mail-coach from Thurso passes through the town to the south,
    in the morning, and another from the south through the town to
    Thurse at night. The mail-coach commenced to run on the
    15th of July 1819. A daily post-gig runs, between Wick and
    Huna, from which latter Place the letters for Orkney are dis-
    patched twice a-week. A steam-boat of 200 horse-power plies
    once a-week, from March till November, between Lerwick, Kirk-
    wall, Wick, Aberdeen, and Leith.
