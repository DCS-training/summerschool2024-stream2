privilege of a weekly market on Thursday, and a yearly fair

discontinued.

   Situation, Extent Surface, Soil and Climate. -This parish
is situated in the west part of that district of Aberdeenshire
called Garioch.  Its length from E. to W. is about 2 com-
puted miles, and its breadth nearly the same.  The general
appearance of the parish is rather hilly; but there little hills
are capable of being cultivated almost to their summits.  The
Water of Gadie, so sweetly celebrated by Arthur Johnston, in
his elegant Latin poems, runs through the parish, from W.
to E. and divides it almost into two equal parts.  It is here
but an inconsiderable rivulet, but abounds with small trout.
The soil of the lower grounds, on the south side of the water,
is a deep, strong, rich mould, on a clayey bottom; and pro-
duces good crops of bear and oats, with very indifferent cul-

a bed of rock or gravel, and though they do not yield such
weighty crops, are earlier than those on the south side of the
parish.  The air is reckoned salubrious, though rather most:
and the seasons are somewhat later than in the lower end of
the Garioch.

   Produce, Cultivation, etc.-The chief productions are oats,
bear, a few acres of pease, turnips, potatoes, and a little hay.

of village, and cropping the ground, still prevails, which was
practiced perhaps 200 years ago.  With the advantage of an
excellent soil, a tolerable climate, and rents by no means ex-
