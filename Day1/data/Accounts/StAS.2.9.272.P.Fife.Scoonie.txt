in  this respect would be favourable to the occupier, except in im-
proving leases, where the capital is all expended by the tenant.
   Farm Buildings.--Owing to a great portion of the property in
this parish being entailed, the farm-steadings are not generally so
commodious as they would require to be, in order to keep pace
with the modern system of husbandry; but still, they are in a gra-
dual state of improvement. The best steading in the parish was
built in 1833 by Mr Fernie on his property of Kilmux, and cost
nearly L. 2000. Attached to it is a steam-engine, which propels
a thrashing machine, and also two pairs of stones for grinding oats.
   The chief obstacle to farther improvement arises from the diffi-
culty of procuring stones for the purposes of building and drain-
ing, there being no quarries of any consequence, except in the
northern part of the parish, and these chiefly of whinstone.
   Manufactures.--The following table gives a view of the several
branches of manufacture, which are at present in operation in this
parish, with the number of individuals employed, and the requisite
capital.

   In the spinning-mills, both adults and children are employed six
days in the week, and work the legal number of hours, as fixed by
the factory bill, namely, twelve hours for five days, and nine hours
on Saturday, making sixty-nine hours per week. Males receive
from 14s. to L. 1, 2s. per week; females from 5s. to 7s. and chil-
dren from 2s. 6d. to 5s.
   These mills are fitted up upon the most improved construction;
and their machinery is adapted for spinning all kinds and sizes of
flax and tow yarns.
   The hand-loom weavers work by the piece, and at their own
homes; consequently, their earnings depend entirely upon their own
skill and industry; but may average 12s. per week for males, and
from 8s. to 1Os. for females. In the foundery, wages run from 12s.
to 24s. per week, and, in the other works, are nearly the same as
those of agricultural labourers. They generally work ten hours a
day. Wages for all kinds of manufacture afford at present a fair
