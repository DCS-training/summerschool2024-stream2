stipend allotted in 1822 is sixteen chalders, half meal and half
barley. There is no chapel or meeting-house here; but the num-
ber of families attending Dissenting chapels in the neighbouring
parishes is 130. Divine service is occasionally performed at
Chapelton, three miles from the stated place of worship. The
number of communicants amounts to 400. A female society for
religious purposes was instituted in January 1835, likewise a paro-
chial library for each division.
	Education.--At Westquarter is one parochial school, in which
are taught besides the common branches, Greek and Latin. The
salary is 300 merks, or L. 16, 13s. 4d. with legal accommodation.
The schoolmaster's fees amount to L. 32 per annum, and his
emoluments from other sources to L. 6 per annum. There are
two schools at Chapelton, one of which has a grant of 100 merks,
or L. 5, 11s. 1d. and a school-house assigned to the teacher. Far-
ther to the west at Mill-well is another school, to which is at-
tached 50 merits or L. 2, l5s. 6 1/2d. with a school-house and garden,
from the Right Honourable Lady Montgomerie, and L. 3 Sterling
from the parish. These schools are so situated as to be accessible
to all the different parts of the parish. In 1832 two Sabbath
schools were opened, one at Westquarter, the other at Chapel-
ton, at which 300 children usually attend; and besides these there
is an adult female Sabbath evening class containing 30; which in-
stitutions are supported by collections.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of paupers regularly
receiving aid in 1832 was about 30, and the average sum calcu-
lated to each, L. 5, 10s. yearly. Besides these, others receive as-
sistance in various sums. The assessment of the parish for that
year was L. 170, 9s. 7d., and the collections at the church door
during 1833 were L. 15, 6s. 1 1/2d.
	Charitable Institutiom.--At Westquarter, one male Friendly So-
ciety, members, 112; one Female do. 23; one Temperance do.
107. At Chapelton, three Friendly Societies, in all 214; one
Temperance do. members, 41.
	These friendly societies are of great benefit not only to the in-
dividuals connected with them, but to the heritors of the parish.
They are calculated both to promote industry and excite a desire
of independence.
	Inns, &c.--There are six houses in Westquarter and Chapelton
that retail spirits. The demoralizing effects of these places of re-
sort are too evident.
	July 1835.
