     Statistical Account

of which, there are now about 299 in the parish.  Some of
these have 6, some 8, some 10, and a few 15 acres of land to
labour.  But in more than two thirds of this parish, one of
these ploughs, with horses of very little more strength than
those at present employed, would thoroughly labour from 24
to 30 acres; and from 16 to 20 acres, in the remaining third.
What an important reduction of the number of horses, and
consequently of expence?  In one instance there have been eight
of these small ploughs united in one farm; in one six, and in
another four.  Some more have been united upon a smaller
scale.
   The grain raised in the parish is bear and oats, with a very
few pease.  The land for barley gets two ploughings; the first cal-
led ribbing, in the fall when it can be overtaken; the other the
seed surrow, immediately before sowing, which takes place
from the beginning till the end of May.  It is made to succeed
oats, and is sown with dung, and a little lime also when it can
possibly be had, the people are very eager to procure it, though
none can be had nearer than the port of Perth.  The return in
general is about five after one, but, where lime has been ap-
plied, eight and upwards.  The boll weighs from 15 to 17
stone Dutch.  About a boll is sown in the acre.  Oats are in
general a scanty crop.  The return is often below three after
one.  They are made to follow both barley and potatoes; but
it is too general a practice to take two successive crops of them
from the same field.  Taking both barley and oats together,
the average return may be about four times the seed.
   Pease are more prolific and luxuriant in the moist than in
the dry lands of the parish, where the droughts and heats of
June frequently dwarf the crop.  The kind always sown is hot
seed, called in this country kasterns.  They are sown about the
middle of April, and reaped from the middle to the end of
September.  The produce is seldom more than three seeds.
