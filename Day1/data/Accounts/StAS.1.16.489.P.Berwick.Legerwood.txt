ploughed, and the seed is now oats or barley, with grass-
seeds.  Where the soil is light and thin, only three suc-
cessive crops are raised upon it; the second of the crops of
oats above mentioned being here omitted.  After this ro-
tation of crops, the field remains unploughed, till the grasses,
of which the seeds were mixed with the last seed of barley
or oats, begin to be exterminated from the sward, and the
native heath and bog-grasses to be unseasonably renewed.
   The manures employed in these processes of agriculture
are solely dung, as is above mentioned, and lime, imported
from Mid-Lothian.  The dung from the stalls of the cattle
is carefully accumulated in the farm-yard, and is, in the
proper season, conveyed thence to be spread upon the fields
under tillage; or the cattle are at times folded in the fields,
so as to manure the ground of the fold as they drop their
dung, without farther care on the part of the owners, than
that of removing the fold occasionally from one situation
to another.  The distance of the lime kilns of Mid-Lothian
would render lime an enormously expensive article of ma-
nure to the farmers of Legerwood and its neighbourhood,
were it not that grain and other things are usually carried
to Dalkeith market, in the carts which return loaded with
lime.  Fields covered deep with strata of peat-earth are
often quickened by the manure of lime to amazing serti-
lity.  Where the soil is of sufficient depth, dung often pro-
duces an excessive luxuriancy of crop, in which the vege-
tation is wasted in straw and empty ears.
   The soil of many parts of these lands does not want
strength sufficient for the production of wheat; but a pre-
vious fallow would generally be necessary, in consequence
of which there would be but one crop obtained in the course
of two years; and no one crop of wheat would be equal in
value to two crops of oats, barley, or turnips.
