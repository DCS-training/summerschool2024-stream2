     PARISH OF TIRY.

     (Presbytery of Mull.-Synod and County of Argyle.)

     By the Reverend Mr ARCHIBALD M'COLL.

     Name.

   TIRY or Tir-I seems to import the country belonging
to I. or Iona, this island lying within 10 leagues of
Icolumkil.  It appears to have been, in the time of St Co-
lumba, part of the patrimony of the church, and to have
supplied that famous seat of learning with considerable quan-
tities of grain.  It had a more ancient name, Rioghachd bar so
thuin, i.e.  'The kingdom whose summits are lower than
'the waves,' and this name, still used in romantic tales,
indicates the natural situation of the island, the lowest and
flattest country perhaps in Scotland.  The waves are often
seen, from the one shore, rising several feet above the level
of the rocks upon the other.  Coll or Colla is another island,
making part of the parish of Tiry, separated E. by N. from
Tiry, by a found about a league broad.  In this sound lies
the island of Gunna, a mile long and half a mile broad.
There are besides several uninhabited islets, such as the two
Soas, Ellen-mor, &c.
