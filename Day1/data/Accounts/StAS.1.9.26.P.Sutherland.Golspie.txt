     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF GOLSPY,

     (COUNTY OF SUTHERLAND, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND
     CAITHNESS, PRESBYTERY OF DORNOCH.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM KEITH.

     Name, Situation, Surface, Soil, &c.

   CULMALIE was the ancient name of this parish.  Gol-
spy is probably derived from goul spaut;-goul sig-
nifying, 'a figure resembling a branch of a tree,' and spaut
'a speat.'  Probably the burn of Golspy ran in that form,
and had often a speat or flood; which is still the case, altho
the form is much changed by reason of frequent inundations.
The place perhaps got its name from the figure of the
burn; and the circumstance of its speats.-This parish ex-
tends from Strathsteven, the N. E. end, to the Little Ferry,
S. W. along the sea, nearly in a straight line; and mea-
sures about 8 miles.  From the boat of the Little Ferry, it
runs along that arm of the sea from S. E. to N. W. for
miles, and thus forms nearly a right angle at the west end.
