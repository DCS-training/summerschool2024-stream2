great decrease in the number of fish caught; which must pro-
teed from some inattention in preserving the salmon fry.  The
cruiving of the river, it is thought, is the chief cause, as the fish
are thereby prevented from going to the fresh-water lakes to
spawn.  In all the lakes in the north of Scotland, which run
to the east, pikes are to be found, but in none that run to the
western sea, at least in the Highlands.

   Coast.-One of the greatest advantages of the parish, is the
vast extent of sea-shore it has; which, computing on both
sides of Locheile, on the north of Lochleven, and a part of
both sides of Linge-Hilloch, amounts to about 70 miles,-
most of which is rocky and high.  The lands, in some places,
rise gradually many yards above the level of the sea, and are
excellent pasturage for sheep, or horses.  There is but little
kelp made in the parish, because it is mostly the property of
the landlords:  and the tenants cut the sea ware, for manuring
the ground, the quantity of dung they have being insufficient
for that purpose.  In some places, the tides run with amazing
violence and rapidity.  There are four very strong currents,-
at Annat, Corran, Ballachulish, and Culisnagon.  The lands,
on both sides of Locheile, being so high, occasion frequent sud-
den squalls, which have sometimes proved dangerous.  Seve-
ral have been drowned, of late years, in the parish. 

   Sea Fish and Fowls.-Herrings are the fish that abound
most, and that are of the greatest benefit.  They generally en-
ter the parish in the month of July, and continue in season,
provided the weather does not prove very stormy, till Novem-
ber.  They are not equally numerous every year.  The peo-
ple of Fort-William, (where the greatest number of boats are,)
reckon that a good fishing-season, in which they catch about
2000 barrels:  last year (1791) there were about 3000 caught;
