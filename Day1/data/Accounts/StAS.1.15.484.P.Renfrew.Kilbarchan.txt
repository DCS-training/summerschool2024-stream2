   Climate, Surface, Soil.-The climate is very wet, but is not
esteemed unhealthy.
   The eastern division of the parish is a flat, level country,
the western is hilly and in part rocky.  About one third of
the East and North-east, consists of a very deep clay.
   Of this eastern division, 500 acres are occupied by a moss
from 7 to 9 feet in depth; the common property of Lord
Semple, Mr Spiers of Elderslie, Mr Cunningham of Craig-
ends, and Mr Napier of Blackstone.  About an acre of this
moss is annually taken off in peats, by the neighbouring in-
habitants.  The soil below is a deep white clay, where has
formerly been a forest.  The oak is perfectly fresh; the o-
ther kinds of timber are rotten.  The stumps in general are
standing in their original position.  The trees are all broken
over at about the height of 3 feet, and are lying from South-
west to North-east.  So wherever you see a stump, you are
sure to find a tree to the North-east.  How an oak tree could
break over at that particular place, I never could understand.
But we may be allowed to form a conjecture, that before the
tree fell, the moss had advanced along its stem, and rotted
it there.  Wood, immersed in a wet body, is found to decay
first at the ring between the wet and the dry.
   The theory of mosses is now illustrated in a satisfactory
manner.  They have all been woods at a former period.
These being cuts, or falling downs, hindered the water from
getting off the ground where they lay.  This encouraged the
moss plants to grow over them.  These plants, while rotting
below, continue to grow above.  Hence a moss continually
increases in depth.  The position of the trees in most mosses,

clay, the springs are less frequent; and the rivulets become muddy in their
progress.  But the inhabitants have adopted the method of purifying their
water, by filtering stones, which renders it as good as any in the world.
