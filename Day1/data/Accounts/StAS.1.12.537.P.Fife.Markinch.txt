blanded bear 14 s., of common bear 13 s. 4 d., of oats 12 s.,
and of oatmeal 15 s. the boll.  The wheat boll is nearly 4
Winchester bushels, the barley and oat boll 6 Winchester
bushels, and the meal boll 8 Dutch stone.  Beef, mutton,
pork, lamb, and veal, sell commonly at 4 1/2 d. the pound, of
22 ounces.  At particular seasons, however, when these ar-
ticles are plentiful, they fall to 3 1/2 d., and at other times,
when theyr are scarce, rise to 5 d., or even to 6 d. the pound.
The price of all kinds of poultry has advanced greatly of
late.  A fed goose will sell at 3 s. 6 d., a turkey at 4 s., a hen
at 1 s., and chicken at 6 d. or 8 d. the pair.  Butter sells at
9 d., common cheese at 3 d., and sweet milk cheese at 4 1/2 d.
the pound.  Butter and cheese are sold by the same weight
with butcher meat.  Some years ago, fish of all kinds were
abundant and cheap.  But now the price is more than doubled.
This extraordinary rise is owing partly to scarcity, and partly
to the increased consumption of the Edinburgh market.

   Prices of Labour.-The wages of day-labourers, from
March to October, are from 1 s. to 1 s. 2 d., and for the rest
of the year from 8 d. to 10 d., varying according to the na-
ture of the work in which they are employed.  In harvest,
men get 10 d., and women 8 d. a-day, with their meat.
When hired for the whole harvest, men have a guinea, and
women 15 s. or 16 s. and their maintenance; and generally
the privilege of some lint sown.  Men servants, who eat in
the house, get of wages from 5 L. to 7 L. a-year, and maid ser-
vants from 2 L. to 3 L.  Farm servants, who furnish their own
provisions, get 6 1/2 bolls of meal, and an allowance for milk,
besides their wages.  Sometimes they have a house and kail-
yard, and cow fed through the year, and, in that case, their
wages are not so high.  Tailors get 8 d. a-day, with their
meat; masons have 1 s. 8 d.; and carpenters 1 s. 6 d.  With-
