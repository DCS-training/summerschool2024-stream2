end and Murray's-hall.  At Murray's-hall, from 12 to 13
chalders of lime are wrought by about 17 hands.  The burn-
ing season begins about April, and ends about Martinmas.
The lime is wrought under ground, in the same manner as
coal.  The seam of time is from 5 feet 6, to five feet 8 or
10 inches thick.  At Craig-end, 16 men and 2 horses are
employed in working yearly about 2000 chalders of lime.
The seam at this work, is about 5 feet 8 inches.  By a chal-
der is meant 6 bolls pease measure.  A chalder of shells is
equal to 18 or 19 bolls of slacked lime.  The lime at both
these works is of the first quality.  An experiment was
made at Craig-end; and in 96 bolls of lime, there was found
only one boll of sand.
   From 50 to 100 hands are usually employed in malting,
and in distilling aquavitae.  There are at least 6 distilleries
in the parish.  Some of them at present, (November 1794,)
are not employed.
