works is 2 s. 6 d.; and about 26,000 carts are sold annualy.

   At Culloch the coal is more heavy, less inflammable, and
considerably sulphureous.  The small coal cakes strongly;
the great leaves a slag, with a great deal of brown ashes.  It
is, however, a good strong coal, and, mixed with that of
Knightswood, makes an excellent fire.  The strata here are
clay; blaize, with several seams of ironstone through it,
some 4 inches thick; limestone, from-3 to 4 1/2 feet thick;
then the coal, from 4 1/2 to 5 feet thick.  The price of the cart
of 12 cwt is 2 s.; and about 13,000 carts are put out in a
year, a great part of which is used in burning the limestone.
The depth of the coal is from 13 to 36 fathoms, and the dip
from north-west to south-east.
