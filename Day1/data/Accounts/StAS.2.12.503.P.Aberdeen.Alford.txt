These circumstances have never been attended to in estimating
the relative proportions of the population of the united kingdom
that strictly belong to agriculture on the one hand, and to all
other classes on the other. The agriculturists have been thus al-
ways reckoned much fewer than they are.

   These last are much employed in agriculture, especially during
the seasons of hoeing and harvest.

   Plantations.-The species of trees planted to greatest extent
are the Scotch and larch firs.  There are also many spruce firs
(Pinus abies) in lands too wet for the other two species.  Recent
experience has proved the wood of this last tree to be much more
durable than any other we have, when used for gate and paling-
posts, if put into the ground with the bark on.
   It can admit of no doubt, that great error has been committed
in planting and managing the Scotch fir, the species first planted
here.  The plantations of that tree have almost all died before at-
taining the age of fifty or sixty, or, in the most favourable cases,
seventy years.  This, of course, involves the necessity of early cutting
and sale; and the wood of the early cut trees has no durability,
being liable to the attack of worm, which utterly destroys it in
thirty or thirty-five years.  The wood of young trees of the Brae-
mar native forests suffers equally from worm, while that of the
aged trees is equally durable with the best Baltic wood; showing
that the durability is entirely dependent on the age of the tree,
and that no valuable wood can be obtained from the plantations till
the cause of the early death of the trees is discovered and removed.
   It seems practically demonstrated by an incident which has occur-
red in a plantation in this parish, that the generally early death of
the planted fir is to be ascribed exclusively to the universal practice,
from whence soever it may have arisen, of planting the trees too
