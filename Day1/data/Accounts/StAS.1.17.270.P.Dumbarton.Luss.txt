subsistence and constant employment; and if he possesses any
waste land, he ought to have sufficient encouragement from
the proprietor for taking it into tillage, and improving it.
When the case is otherwise, he is under a temptation of
ruining his ground, by over-cropping it, one of the most
prevailing errors in the present Highland system of farming.
But the man, on the other hand, whose chief dependence is
upon days labour, or some other employment, ought to have
land sufficient only for supplying his family with milk, pota-
toes, and other necessaries, but not so much as to divert his
attention from his proper business.  Grazing farms, and es-
pecially sheep farms, must, from their nature, be on a greater
scale.  In them a great range, and a variety of pasture, are
indispensibly necessary.  As much as the state of property,
therefore, will permit, their boundaries ought to be the
great boundaries of nature.  When the pasture of a hill or
mountain is parcelled out among two or three different te-
nants, without any inaccessible gullies or rocks to form a line
of separation, the cattle of each will be constantly trespassing
somewhere, and therefore constantly chaced from one part to
another, so that neither will receive much benefit from it.
Common pasture, in such a case, is seldom found to be a re-
medy for the evil.  Whatever wise and just regulations may
at first be laid down for fixing the proportion of cattle to be
kept by each, they are never in fact adhered to; and the
ground is always overstocked.
   The present breed of sheep in this parish may perhaps be
changed with advantage.  In every attempt of this kind,
however, great caution is necessary.  The trial should first
be made with small parcels, and rather by the proprietors
than by the tenants.  Sheep are delicate animals, subject to
many diseases, and when they are taken from one country
to another, or even from one farm to another, it takes
