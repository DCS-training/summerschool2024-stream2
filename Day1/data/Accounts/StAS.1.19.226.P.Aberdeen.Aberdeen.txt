     Statistical Account

that on some of the sculls there was found long yellow
hair, neatly wrapped round and plaited with an woollen
fillet or string in form of a queue, which did not appear to
be rotten.  As there were no remains of any coffin, and in-
deed no appearance from the position of the bones that the
bodies had been regularly interred, and as this field is at the
west end of the town, exactly in the line of the pursuit from
the field of battle, it is conjectured, that on that occasion
the bodies of many, who had fallen near the place, had been
huddled together, and promiscuously thrown into this clay
pit, for such it appeared to have been.  It was on that oc-
casion that Montrose gave up the town to the pillage of the
soldiers, who were mostly Irish, and cruelly massacred many
of the harmless inhabitants, insomuch, that the women only
durst appear, and take concern in burying the dead.  It is
about twenty years since the discovery of these sculls and
other human bones was made.

   Intended Canal.-There are at present no navigable ca-
nals in this place, unless the lead at the printfield is consi-
dered as one, and it has been used as such, only for bring-
ing stones from a quarry to the buildings of the manufac-
ture.  A subscription has been raised to obtain a survey of
a canal from Aberdeen, up Don side to Monymusk, with a
branch up the water of Ury, through the Garioch, to Insch.
The survey is made by Captain George Taylor, and the
undertaking found to be practicable.  A small all cut, twenty
feet wide, by three feet and a half deep, is intended to
carry boats of twenty or thirty tons burden.  The locks
and bridges will be fewer, and less expensive than most
people acquainted with the grounds are apt to suppose.  The
expence is within reach of the gentlemen proprietors of
the lands adjacent.  The quantity of goods now carried by
land is sufficient to pay a reasonable interest for the money
