buy coals from the ports of Arbroath and Montrose, the
first 15, the other 10 miles from Menmuir.  These coals, to
such as have them to purchase, will come to 12 s. and 13 s.
the cart-load.  If they go to Arbroath, the distance is very
great; if to Montrose, they are 1 s. 6 d. or 2 s. the boll dearer,
from the heavy duty that is exacted whenever sea coal pas-
ses a little promontory called Redhead.  So heavy is this
burden, that it is found to be more frugal to burn small,
coal from Newcastle, than what come from the Frith of
Forth.  This grievance, which hurts the poor, and checks

be removed by a new tax on some less needful commodity,
or by an equalization of the duty; perhaps an additional
halfpenny levied in genenal on Fife and Lothian coal might-
answer the end.

Sterling.   The real rent is L. 1599 a year.  The average rent
of farms may be L. 50.  The general rent of the best ara-

bourers, when industrious, can bring up their families with-

dium, are L. 6 for a man, and L. 3 for a woman.  The wa-
