   Population.  There are 382 families in the parish, includ-
ing those in the island of Stroma.  The number of males is
881, and of females 1069, total 1950.  The return to Dr.
Webster in 1755, was only 1481 souls.  The population has
therefore increased 469 within there 40 years.  The advance-
ment of civilization, the free enjoyment of property, a better
cultivated soil, the multiplicity of families on small farms, and
more extensive employment in fishing and the other maritime
occupations, may be considered as the operative sources of this
increase.  As these causes acquire additional energy, propor-
tional effects may he expected.  Were the waste grounds culti-
vated, and some little branches of manufacture established, the
yearly produce of the soil, and the number of souls in the
parish, might amount to a third more, than what they now
are.  The following list shews the number of births, deaths,
and marriages, for the last 4 years,
