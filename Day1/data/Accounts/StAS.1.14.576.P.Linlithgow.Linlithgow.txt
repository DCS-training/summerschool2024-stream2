   Among the useful institutions here, Dr. Henry's lib-
rary justly deserves to be named.  That gentleman, well
known to the world by his valuable history, having ex-
perienced the sweets of knowledge himself, benevolently
wished others to share them.  With that view, he be-
queathed his books, under certain regulations, to the ma-
gistrates and town council, and ministers of the presbytery
of Linlithgow, as the foundation of a larger collection.
It is to be hoped, they will show themselves worthy of
the trust, and promote a design of such general utility.
   Besides the Established Church, there are two places of
worship in the parish; one for those of the Burgher per-
suasion, which adjoins to the town, the other at Craig-
mailin, about 3 miles distant, to which the Antiburghers
resort.  The number of dissenters in the parish is about
430.  That alienation of heart which diversity of religious
opinions once produced in scotland, seems now in a great
measure banished.
   While our countrymen are dias imbibing more and
more of the spirit of love, may they ever retain that of

to support that glorious constitution, which is found, from
experience, to conduce so effectually to the benefit of the
individuals which is so admirably calculated to ensure, un-
der God, the prosperity of the empire!
