in winter, and thrown by the spade into the pit out of which
the peats were taken in the preceding year.  It then forms
the sprendfield, or ground upon which the new peats are laid
out to be dried.  As the whole of it cannot be thus disposed
of, the remainder is by means of little canals formed for the
purpose, floated down into the Forth.  The peats are always
cast as soon as possible after seed-time, and are carried home
in the course of the summer or harvest.  It was a remarkable
proof of the uncommon wetness of the season 1792, that few
peats were got home that year, but remained on the spread-
field till next summer.  This circumstance had not happened
before in the memory of man, and necessarily subjected poorer
families to very great inconvenience.

   Clearing away of Moss.-As the carse soil is so valuable, it
must be an object of importance to the proprietors, to have the
superjacent moss cleared away*.  Those portions of land,
which in this parish are recovered from the moss, are such as
lie under old spreadfields, from which the peats have formerly
been taken.  This operation is generally performed in winter.
The water which comes down from the higher grounds in burns
or rivulets contiguous to the moss, is by means of small ducts
or canals introduced into the spreadfield which is intended to
be put away.  The spreadfield having been previously inter-
sected with these canals, of a proper depth and width, its sub-
stance is, by many hands, thrown into these when water can
be had in plenty, and thus carried down into the river.  Much
yet remains to be done, before the arable land is procured.
About a foot of moss mixt with many fragments of trees and
