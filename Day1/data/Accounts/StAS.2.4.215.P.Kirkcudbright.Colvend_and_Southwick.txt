	               COLVEND AND SOUTHWICK.

      PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

		     THE REV.  ANDREW M'CULLOCH, MINISTER.

	        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Extent--This parish extends in length, from east to west,
along the coast of the Solway Frith, about 8 miles, and is, from
north to south, 4 miles broad.
	Topographical Appearances.--The surface is extremely rough
and irregular. Broom, furze, and bramble spread with amazing ra-
pidity. Many of the higher grounds are poor and shallow, owing
to the soil being carried down to the valleys. These, however, are
fertile and kindly, and produce grain of good quality and excellent
pasture. Towards the east or Southwick side, many of the farms
are in a high state of cultivation.
	Besides a ridge of hills that run through the middle of the pa-
rish, there is a mountainous range covered with heath, and run-
ning to the large and conspicuous mountain of Criffel.
	Coves or Caves.-There are a number of these along the "wild
shores of caverned Colvend." The principal of these is called
the Piper's cove, from a legend that a piper undertook to explore
it. He carried his pipes with him, and continued to play under
ground till be reached Barnbarrach, about four miles distant from
its mouth. The sound then ceased, and nothing was ever heard
again of the unfortunate minstrel. It is found, however, to be only
120 yards in length. There is a well in the middle, 22 feet deep.
There are a number of fissures in the rocks along the shore.
Close by the Piper's cove, already mentioned, there is a rude na-
tural arch, about 40 feet in heigbt, called the Needle's Eye. An-
other arch, bearing the same name, and lyhng more to the east-
ward, is more regularly formed though not so high.
	Hydrography.--There are a number of small lakes in the pa-
rish. A strong chalybeate flows from one of the clefts. It was
formerly used as a tonic in intermittent fever.
