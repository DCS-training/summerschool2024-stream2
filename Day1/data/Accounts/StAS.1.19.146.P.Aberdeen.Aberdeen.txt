and New Aberdeen, and the villages of Gilcomston and
Hardgate, give a pleasant variety to the general appearance
of this parish.  The steep and rugged banks of the Don,
from the house of Seaton till below the bridge, are so truly
romantic, that they seldom escape the stranger's notice.
These rocks, abounding with an immense variety of herbs,
covered partly with wood, and partly with furze, afford
ample gratification both to the botanist and the lover of ru-
ral beauty.  Winding in a semicircular form, as you walk
along their summits, you command in one direction, con-

Gothic arch which is thrown over the river; while, on the

Cathedral, the spires of Aberdeen, and the various menu-
factories on the different meanders of the Don.  These
prospects, if you look down, are delightfully varied, by the
fishermen plying their little boats, at the depth of 50 or 60
feet below.  This place has been compared to the beauti-

   On the south side of the parish, near to Ferryhills, are
many curious little Sandhills, lying in all different direc-

retiring of some immense quantity of water.  Among
there one called the round O deserves to be particularly no-

of a moss, and has a hollow in it of considerable depth, like
an inverted sugar-loaf.  This hollow is marshy in the bot-
tom.  As to its cause I have heard no conjecture.  About
this place are several beautiful villas; and it affords excel-
lent situations for many more.
   The soil in this parish is in some places naturally fertile,
in others barren; and many parts of it have been forced
into fertility by astonishing labour and expence.  Where
it has not been meliorated by art, it is in general shallow,
