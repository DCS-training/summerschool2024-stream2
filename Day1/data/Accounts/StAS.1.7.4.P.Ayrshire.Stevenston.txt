uninhabited rocky island, about two mites S. W. of the
Trune, and near four miles N. W. of Ayr, on which there

south-east of this little Island, between it and Ayr, and bring
these two spires to bear in a line with herself, the may drop

is narrower, but nearly double the length of the first.
The ground of the upper parish is unequals many parts
