     of Kilsyth.

I am happy to have it in my power to say, that there are per-
sons yet alive in this place who have proved by the uniform
tenor of their lives, that they were not of the number,
though their religious impressions were received at that period.
By their fruits they may still be known, and the effects of
conversion on men's practice is the only true test and criteri-
on by which we ought to judge.  Whatever were the means,
whether hope, or fear, or sympathy, or example they expe-
rienced at that period a great and important change, which
has formed and decided their characters through life.  And
"if the sabbath of the Lord, which was formerly despised, was
"then held honourable; if the ordinances of religion, which
"were formerly neglected, were then strictly observed; if the
"old and the young became servent and frequent in family
"and private prayers; if drunkenness and licentiousness were
"then discountenanced, cursing and swearing discontinued;
"and if silthiness and foolish talking, gave place to the pious
"and pure effusions of a grateful heart; if, in a word, strife
"and contention, wrath and malice ceased, and love, and
"peace, and long suffering, and forbearance, and forgive-
"ness of one another prevailed, if the thief stole no more,
"but made restitution; and a whole parish at once, became
"decent and devout, sober and serious; and that they did
"so, is attested by pastor and people*, heritors, elders, and
"Magistrates, in 1742, and by all the wise and worthy men,"
of the congregation of Kilsyth, who were eye witnesses to the
events of that year, and are still alive; call this enthusiasm, or call
it by any other name, I pray God, that I may ever feel its in-
fluence, and bear testimony to its power among this people!
