who had been successively Principal of the Universities of Edin-
burgh and Glasgow, and then promoted to be minister of Paisley;
Alexander Dunlop, father of the Principal; Robert Millar, author
of the " History of the Propagation of Christianity," and other
works of merit; John Witherspoon, afterwards President of the
College of New Jersey, and one of the best divines of the Scot-
tish Church; Robert Findlay, the late eminently learned and
pious Professor of Theology in Glasgow College; Robert Tan-
nahill, the author of many beautiful Songs ; Alexander Wilson,
the celebrated American Ornithologist ; Dr Robert Watt, author
of the " Bibliotheca Britannica;" John Henning, the distinguish-
ed modellist ; and William Motherwell, whose genius and highly
gifted poetical talents have been lately consigned to an early
grave.  Of eminent natives still alive, we notice John Wilson,
the distinguished Professor of Moral Philosophy in the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh; and Dr John Thomson, one of the orna-
ments of the Edinburgh Medical School.  The authors of the
former Statistical Account of this parish, Dr Boog and Dr
Snodgrass, deserve a place in any catalogue of distinguished
men; and it is worthy of notice, that John Wilson, Esq. of
Thornley, who rendered such eminent service in drawing up the
articles on Agriculture and Geology in that account, still survives,
in thd enjoyment of excellent health, at a venerable age.
