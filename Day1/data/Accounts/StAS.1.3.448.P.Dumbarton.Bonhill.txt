discovered amazing industry, and made very great wages; al-
though the masters had the same quantity of work done for
less money, than formerly when the men were at days wages.
For these two years past, however, there have been violent
disputes between the masters and servants, about the prices
for the different pieces of work; the masters, on the one
hand endeavouring to reduce the prices, and to lower the

servants, on the other, endeavouring to keep up the prices,
