name, runs eastward, and at last washes for a mile, the S.
W. boundary of this parish.  From the N. W. point of
the parish, about the distance of 2 miles, the road from
Dundee to Brechin crosses the rivulet, which, near its ef-
flux into the eastuary is called Buddon, in a northern di-
rection.  About 4 miles from the N. W. point of the pa-
rish, the old road from Dundee to Arbroath crosses the
Burn of Murroes, in an eastern direction.  About 5 miles
from the N. W. point of the parish, the new turnpike-
road from Dundee to Arbroath crosses the Dighty in a
N. E. direction.

   Beach.-Within water-mark, on the bounds of this pa-
rish, a very few rocks only are seen; the far greater part
is sandy and level.  The links which skirt the coast, and
stretch from the village of the East Ferry, so called, in
contradistinction to that of the West Ferry, in the parish
of Dundee, to which it joins, rise in a few places into
small knolls, but oftener approach to a plain.

   Soil.-From the links on the W. of the Dighty, the
ground suddenly rises, and then gently declines towards
the river; and the soil is generally an excellent loamy
black.  From the links on the E. of the Dighty, there
spreads for more than a mile almost a level plain; and the
soil is at first light and sandy, but extremely fertile, and
then assumes a rich blackness of colour.  Black and ex-
cellent, the ground' now gradually swells towards certain
hills of inconsiderable height, which at large intermediate
spaces traverse the parish from N. to S. from the village
of Drumsturday-moor, built on the sides of the old road
from Dundee to Arbroath, to the vicinity of the village
of the East Ferry, near Broughty castle.  From these hills
the ground again descends towards the Burn, near its ter-
