   Climate, Disease, Longevity.-This parish is an extremely
healthful situation. While the Grampian mountains pro-
tect it from the nipping frosts of the north, it is finely ex-

rapidity of the river Teith, and the smallest rivers, have

distress on their helpless infants.  This extreme care and
anxiety is a strong mark of parental fondness and love; but
experience is the strongest argument, and nothing ought

evidently an epidemical disease; and, if it be true that the
natural pox is much more destructive than the inoculate, no
person should hesitate in adopting the practice.  It has been
clearly shewn, from the practice of many eminent gentle-
men of the faculty, that, in the natural way, one in four or
five generally dies: but, by inoculation, not one of a thou-
