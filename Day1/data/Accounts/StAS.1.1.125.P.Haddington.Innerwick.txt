a corruption for King Edward, who is supposed to have built
it.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The air is generally dry and
healthy.  There is a spring-well, the water of which is re-
markable for its lightness.  There are two free-stone quar-
ries.  No coal is worked, but small seams are visible in dif-
ferent places.  There is lime upon the coast in great abun-
dance, with a small seam of coal below it.  The rent of cottages
is from 15 to 20 shillings.  Coal is used as fuel on the coast,
peat and turf on the moors.  The people are, in general,
more expensive in their mode of living than formerly.  They
are very humane to those who have been ship-wrecked.  There
are many inclosures in the parish; but some farmers think
them disadvantageous, as they occupy too much of the high
rented corn land, and harbour birds.
