     Statistical Account

   Church.-The church was built in the year 1749; and
the manse was repaired, and the office houses rebuilt in 1783.
The living consists of 16 bolls of meal, 6 bolls of bear, and
850 merks Scots, (L. 47: 4: 5 4/12), in money, and 6 acres of
land; in all about L. 66 sterling a year.-The Crown is
patron.

   School.-The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks Scotts,
(L. 5: 11: 1 4/12), with some perquisites which do not exceed
L. 3 per annum.  There are few scholars.

   Poor.-The number of poor at present, who receive occa-
sional alms, is 10; but all  of them have property, and
earn most of their subsistence, except 3 old persons.  They
live in houses near their children, who ate in a thriving con-
dition.  They receive out of the poors funds, the price of a
boll of meal, one after another, as they require it, on applying to
the elders, any Sunday after sermon, and also money to buy
fuel in the season.  Orphan children ate boarded at the rate of
L. 4 sterling per annum.  No person, properly belonging to 
this parish, is in the habit of strolling about as a mendicant.
Indeed, in this manufacturing country, such as are able to
go about and beg, are generally fit, unless they have infant
children, to earn their bread at home, the women by spinning,
and the men by filling pirns, (rolling up yarn upon lake seeds,
cut in small pieces for the shuttle).  By experience, we have
found it to be a great saving of our poors funds, to aid those
who are sinking into poverty, before they fall too low.  To
support the, poor we have the weekly collections and seat-rents
of a lost, in the church, erected out of the poors money, in
all about L. 15 or L. 16 per annum; and L. 156 lent out upon
interest, at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent.  This fund, for these 16
years past, has been fully adequate to the demands of the poor,
