     Statistical Account

if an estate often changed its master, it became in reality
an object of commerce, and every new proprietor made it
somewhat better for his own interest.
   It is curious to observe the progressive rise of the land rent
in this parish, since the year 1642; the rent of the plough-
gate in those days, was about one hundred merks, besides
seu services: and there is reason to believed that the valua-
tion in Cromwel's time, in this district, was made as high as
the land could really afford in rent; during the first years of
the Restoration, land seems to have risen, (as appears from
some old tacks:)  From the 1680, till the year 1715, it
appears that the rise was but trisling; after this period it
rose considerably; and, in the year 1748, was about 1500 L.
Sterling; the next rise was in the year 1763; and, consider-
ing the value of the land in the natural possession of the small
proprietors to keep pace with the tenantry, it rose to about
3000 L. Sterling.  The land-rent this present year, is betwixt
seven and eight thousand per annum, upon leases, or in the
natural possession of the small proprietors.

   By this statement, it is evident, that land gives fourteen
times more rent in money than it did 150 years ago; allow-
ing for the services and other prestations payed by the ten-
ants in those days, perhaps we ought not to reckon so high-
ly; whether this rise, however, is to be ascribed to the gra-
dual improvement of landed property, or the depreciation of
money, becomes another question; and perhaps the land-
holders will not have so much reason to boast of their advan-
ced rents, if the enquiry be fairly made; in this rental, that
of cot-houses is not comprehended, which is at least five hun-
