by a wizard, to beware of Correechie, and hearing the name
of this place, he took the alarm, thinking this to be that
place he was warned about, and he immediately decamp-
ed, and marched forth to the Hill of Fair; in a hollow
place of which, called the How of Correechie, the engage-
ment was*.

*On the large moor between this parish and Kinellar, although there is
no tradition about it, there has some time been either a battle, or a great
carnage in a flight:  this appears by a great number of cairns, greater and
lesser, that are upon it  In taking up one of the larger cairns some years
ago, for building fences on his farm, Mr John Lumsden in Bog-heads
found in the outer or higher part of the cairn, several pieces of a black
substance, lighter than cinder, with dots of a different colour, and perforated
as for being stringed.  When he came to the bottom and centre of the
cairn, he found something like a coffin, formed of long stones artificially
put together, in or near which coffin, (for as it was disordered and filled 
with the earth in raising, he is not sure which), there was a large ring,
that would contain two or three fingers, of a substance like veined marble, 
and an urn containing human hair.  These things appeared to every per-
son here that has seen them, to have been before the days of Christianity
in this country.  The articles dug up, he says, are at present in the hands
of the Earl of Buchan, where they may be seen.  There is also on the
same moor another larger cairn, where probably one of the chiefs
has been buried; but I have never heard an ancient or a Gaelic name to
any of the cairns.  There lies upon the east side of Kintore, near the Don,
an artificial mount of earth, called the Castlehill, which probably at first
served for a Law, and afterwards for a watch tower; for Laminformed,
that, upon any sudden invasion of the country, it was one of the places
where fires were kindled to spread the alarm speedily through Scotland;
and indeed Kintore was a place much resorted to in the days of the wars
that were in Scotland, being not only a fine field, before there was much
tillage in the country, but centrical, and on the way north both from A-
berdeen and the passages of the Grampian hills.  There in on the west side
of Kintore a marsh still called the Rollo mire, which, with other adjacent
lands, is said to have belonged to one of the name of Rollo, who settled
and made a figure here soon after the days of William the Conqueror.
It is from this mire, and the river, which at this place is like standing wa-
ter, that the mildews rise, that in harvest so often blight our barley crops
