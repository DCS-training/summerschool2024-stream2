near the house, is a Druidical ruin.  The late Earl John, in
digging his garden, found ten brass cannon quite entire, two
feet under the surface; they were about six pounders, of the
swivel kind, with the Campbell's arms, and are still used on
birth days; but we have no tradition concerning them.

   Sectaries and Heritors.-There are two Seceding meetings
in the parish, one of the sect of Antiburghers, and the other of
the old Covenanters.  In this last sect there are not above 
fifty.  There are about ten or twelve Burgher Seceders.

It has a slate roof, and a very good accommodation for the

feet long by 16 feet within the walls, and 10 feet high.
The schoolmaster's salary is L. 100 Scots; he has seldom less
