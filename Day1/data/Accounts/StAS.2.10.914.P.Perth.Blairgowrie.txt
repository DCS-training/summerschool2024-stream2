	About twenty years ago, the workmen engaged in removing a large
	mound of gravel in the western part of the town, uncovered two
	Roman cinerary urns containing burnt bones, but these were un-
	fortunately broken and thrown away by the men as of no value.
	A Roman spear head was also found many ydars age in the great
	moss vf Cochrage, already mentioned, and is now in the posses-
	sion of the writer.  Another was found, about eight years ago,
	near the bed of the river.  There was also found in the neigh-
	bourhood of the town, and close to one of the cairns above
	mentioned, a coin of the Emperor Hadrian in bronze.  Close
	beside the manse, there formerly existed a green conical mount,
	about 200 yards in circumference, called the " Hurcheon" or
	" urchin hill," on which, according to tradition, the Earls of Gow-
	rie and their predecessors, in times still more remote, held their
	baron courts, for administering justice (or at least such jus-
	tice as the weak could expect from the strong in these bar-
	barous times,) to their vassals and retainers ; and, as these fierce
	barons were then invested with the formidable power of " pit
	and gallows," this mount must, doubtless, have often witnessed
	the last despairing glance of the wretched offenders against their
	despotic chief, ere they were burried away to their doom.  There
	is a ridge or rising ground within less than a quarter of a mile to the
	westward of this knoll, which still bears the name of the " gallow
	(or gallows) bank," where, according to tradition, the unfortunate
	criminals condemned at the neighbouring baronial court were im-
	mediately afterwards, `nd without further ceremony, hung up to
	the bough of a tree.  The hill or mount, in its original and perfect
	state, had a flat space on the top, which was surrounded with an
	embankment or rampart of earth ; but most unfortunately the whole
	of the earth composing it was some years ago carted away, and
	put upon part of the glebe, and there are now few vestiges re-
        maining./f* There is a small island in one of the lochs already de-
	scribed, on which the traces of a building are still to be discerned,
	and tradition states that, in times of peril, the inhabitants of the
	surrounding district removed their most valuable effects to this

        <FOOTNOTE>In the course of digging the foundations of the new wing added to the manse,
	in 1838, there was discovered, in the centre of the space formerly occupied by the
	mound, a circular excavation, about three feet in diameter, and six feet in depth,
	which had been dug far down into the hard gravel, and afterwards filled up with black
	unctuous looking mould, intermixed with ashes and pieces of charred wood.  The
	writer examined this excavation, but can form no conjecture as to its origin or pur-
	pose, unless it may be supposed to mark the spot where witches were formerly burnt,
	-many of whom, according to tradition, were executed on this knoll,
