ripe; and they lay buried under the snow till February 1783.
Though every possible exertion was made to recover them,
yet very little was obtained.  The people were in the most
miserable condition for provisions; obliged to purchase them
at a great distance and at such a high price, that many fa-
milies were put on very short allowance.  Many were reduced
to extreme indigence, from which they have not yet recover-
ed.-But notwithstanding the coldness of the climate, the in-
habitants are as healthy, if not more so, than their neigh-
hours.  They are not liable to any peculiar local diseases, and
many of them live to a very great age.  Two persons died
last spring at the age of 93; and there are several at present
in the parish near 90 years of age, who enjoy their strength
and faculties, very little impaired for that advanced age.

   Soil and Produce.-The cultivated ground in the parish
bears but a very small proportion to that which is lying waste,
perhaps not above a 15th part.  But the soil, of what is cul-
tivated, is, for the most part, of a very good quality, and, in
favourable seasons produces plentiful crops.  The grain
raised here is chiefly black oats.  Some Scotch barley and rye
are likewise raised.  All the tenants and their cottagers plant
potatoes, which ordinarily thrive remarkably well, and make
a considerable part of their maintenance.  In favourable
years, the produce is nearly equal to the consumption of the
parish; but, in unfavourable seasons, when the crops fail, they
are under a necessity of procuring considerable quantities of
grain from other places.  The quantity of grain, necessary for
the support of the inhabitants, would require to be much
greater, were it not that the numbers of cattle and sheep, kept
in the parish, furnish them with flesh and milk in aid of other
provisions.
