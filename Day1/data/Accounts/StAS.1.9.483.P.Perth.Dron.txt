scene.  You see the current sliding from rock to rock, or
gushing into little cavities formed by its perpetual lapse,
pleasing at once the eye and the ear by its murmurs and
meanders.  When you reach the fall itself, you enter a
kind of open grotto, surrounded with rocks, and shaded
with trees, whose tops nearly close over the head, and cast
a gloom, which adds to the romantic appearance of the
scene.  The precipice itself, which is directly in front, is a
rugged perpendicular rock, which bends itself on each side
into a semicircular form, inclosing a neat pebbly bason, in-
to which the descending torrent throws itself.  In its usual
state it is but a scanty rill- but when swelled by winter
rains or bursts of thunder clouds, it assumes a formidable
aspect, rolls along a deep and turbid stream, and gushes o-

precipitation, dashing into the pool below with a hideous
noise, which stuns the ear, and reverberates from rock to
rock on every side.

   Rocking Stone.-On the south descent of the hill, oppo-
site to the church and manse, stands what is called the
Rocking stone of Dron, presenting at once a monument of
ancient ingenuity and superstition.  It is a large mass of
whinstone, of an irregular figure, about 10 feet in length,
and 7 in breadth, and stands in a sloping direction.  On
gently pressing the higher end with the finger, it has a per-
ceptible motion, vibrating in an arch of between one and
two inches, and the vibration continues for rome time after
the pressure is removed.  It is placed on a flat stone in the
earth, which, doubtless, has a small, though invisible exca-
vation, to receive its centrical prominence, and to prevent
it being thrown off its balance.  Neither Buchanan, who
has mentioned the rocking stone of Balvaird, in his elegant
History of Scotland, nor any other author, recollected at
