     Roads.--The roads are excellent.  Two more are projected,
or in progress. When the one from Troquhain to Minnibuie is
opened, the parish, in this respect, will be complete, the means
of communication greatly improved, and lime introduced at a
much cheaper rate.
     Wages.--Wages for men, including victuals, range from L.10
to L.13 per annum. Women servants receive from L.2 to L.3
for the half-year. Day labourers may be hired at Is., Is. 6d., 2s.,
according to the nature of their employment, and the season of
the year.
     Raw Produce.--The following, according to a calculation made
by six intelligent farmers, is a near approach to the average gross
amount of raw produce of Balmaclellan.

     Associations.--Notice might here be taken of the Glenkens'
Society, as having given a beneficial impulse to the learning, in-
dustry, and morality of the district.

                           V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
     Roads.--There is no market-town in the parish. The roads,
however, to Castle Douglas and Dumfries are excellent, and both
these places are frequented by the farmers of Balmaclellan.

     Post-Office.--The nearest post-office is in the neighbouring
burgh of New Galloway.
     Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church is conveniently situ-
ated for the greater part of the population. It was enlarged and
substantially repaired a few years ago, and is calculated to afford
accommodation for 370 persons. Though much too small for
sacramental occasions, when worship is performed in the open air,
it is still sufficiently comfortable and commodious for the ordinary
service of the Sabbath. The attendance is excellent. Perhaps,
however, about 200 of the population might be advantageously
thrown into a new parish, comprehending destitute and remote
