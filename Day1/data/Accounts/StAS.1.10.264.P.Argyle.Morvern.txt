gust rains, and autumnal storms.  The whole of the parish,
especially the west side, or that part which looks towards the
Sound of Mull, is so much exposed, that the raising of crops
of any kind is always a precarious business, and, in some sea-
sons, a certain loss.  For this reason, most of the inhabitants,

even above 90; and there are now living several above 80,
particularly one man and his wife, who were married more
than 60 years ago, and whose faculties and strength are so
far from being impaired, that they continue to follow their
respective employments with astonishing alacrity and vigour.
The most common ailments are colds and rheumatisms, of
which few people are supposed to die; but whether there

the province of physicians to determine.

   Seed Time, Harvest, Crops, etc.-In a climate so wet, it is
not to be supposed that sowing can commence early: We
commonly begin about the middle of March, and, unless the
season proves unfavourable, expect to cut down about the
latter end of September.  From our small oats we have but
