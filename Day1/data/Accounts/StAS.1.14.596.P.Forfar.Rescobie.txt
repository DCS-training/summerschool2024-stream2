statistical articles, such as hire, wages, etc. the writer

   From so many lakes, with their adjacent marshes, our
climate may be supposed rather unwholesome; but, in
fact, it is otherwise.  The situation of the parish is mostly
vallicular, lying between two hills, that of Dunnichen on
the S., and of Turin on the N., which rise above 600 feet
above the lakes, and, running parallel, form a kind of
spout or sucker, which frequently occasions a strong cur-
rent in the atmosphere that purifies it, and, thus render-
ing the air salubrious, keeps the inhabitants healthy.  And
hence, instances of longevity, equal to that of any other
country: a woman died here, this winter, at the very ad-
vanced age, as is said, of 104, and we have living in-
stances upwards of 80 and 90; our people are not liable
to frequent sickness, nor have we any local or peculiar
maladies.

   Soil and Agriculture.-The soil is various: part of it rich
and fertile, part of it poor and barren; but Nature has
furnished the thrifty farmer with a ready and effectual
remedy for the poverty of the soils and the worst may be,
and is made productive by the due application of marl.
In consequence, the value of land is much increased; the
new farmer does not boggle at promising double or triple
the former rent, and it is the laird's business to look to the
payment.  And though, from want both of means and
skill in adventurers, failures may sometimes happen,
this does not discourage others from stepping forward
