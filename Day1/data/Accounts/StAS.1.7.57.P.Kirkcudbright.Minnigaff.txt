more wanted for the purposes of agriculture, they generally
use good middle sized draught horses.

   There are also bred in the parish some goats, which are
supposed to answer better than sheep on the excessively rug-
ged grounds which are frequently to be met with.  Their
number is not very great.  They are worth 7 L. or 8 L. per
score.

   Rent, Soil, Crops.-The rent of land varies astonishingly
in different parts of the parish.  In some places it is let not
by the acre, but by the mile, one farm containing several in
extent each way.  In the southern part of the parish, arable
land brings from 20 s. to 30 s. per acre.  The soil is such as
might be expected from the appearance of the country.  Bar-
renness is certainly its most striking characteristic.  There is,
however, a small stripe of land lying along the Cree, which
is abundantly fertile.  The soil of this is light and shallow,
but kindly, and, in wet seasons, produces excellent crops.
The part of this tract which lies nearest Wigton Bay is of a
different quality, being a deep clay, and in some places cover-
ed with moss.  This is not unfertile.  The crops raised are
oats, barley, rye, wheat, potatoes, and turnip.  What number
of acres are respectively occupied by each of these cannot easily
be determined.  By far the greatest number is employed in rai-
sing oats; and, next to them, in barley or bear.  Wheat and
turnips are not cultivated to any extent, and have been tried
rather as experiments, than as forming a part of the general
plan of husbandry.  These experiments have been successful.
The whole grain produced in the parish does no more than
supply the inhabitants.
