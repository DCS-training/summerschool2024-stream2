1750, the cart sold on the coal-hill at 9 d.  If it then
weighed 900 weight, the price of coals was just 1 d. per 100
weight.  At present, the cart sells on the coal-hill at 2 s. 3 d.
It is said to weigh 1200 weight, consequently the price of
coals is 2 1/4 d. per 100 weight, which is more than double
their price 40 years ago.

   Weavers.-The weaving of holland, or fine linen, was
begun here about 60 years ago, and gave employment to a
few looms.  The weavers bought the yarn, wove it into
cloth, bleached the cloth and carried it to market; so that
they engrossed several businesses, which are now almost en-

weaving of lawns and cambricks came in place of holland,
or fine linen.  The yarn was now furnished by dealers in
that commodity in Glasgow, to whom the weavers return-
ed it in webs, for which they received payment according
to their quantity and quality.  In 1783, the weaving of
muslin was introduced, which, for several years past, has
given employment to all the weavers here, except a few

same time, the art of weaving received a considerable im-
provement, by the introduction of the fly-shuttle, which is
now generally used.  It enables the weaver to do more
work, with greater ease to himself, and which is of still 
higher importance, the erect position of his body is favour-
able to health.  An ordinary weaver can easily make 10 s.
a week.  In this parish there are 120 weavers, including
journeymen and apprentices,  who may be supposed to gain
about  L. 2800 per annum.

   Cotton Work.-In 1787, a cotton work was established at
a village called Flemington.  At present, it consists of 2
carding machines and 17 jennies, including 1 for roving and
