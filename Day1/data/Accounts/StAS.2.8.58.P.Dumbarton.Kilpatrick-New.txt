   Manufactures and Arts.-The chief branches of manufacture
and art, are calico-printing, cotton-spinning, and bleaching of cot-
tons and linens. We have now (1835) three printfields, which em-
ploy 623 hands, and throw off annually 167,800 pieces of 24 yards
each. It is chiefly block-printing that is carried on ; but some
machinery has recently been erected, and more is about to be in-
troduced into the works at Milngavie. The cotton-factory em-
ploys 130 persons, and is now being enlarged to double its former
extent. Two bleachfields employ 82 persons; at the Clober field
3,169,814 yards of cloth are bleached annually, of which 146,746
yards are lineb. A paper-mill, conducted till lately on the old sys-
tem, employed 22 men and several females, and produced twenty
reams of paper a-day, but now that the improved machinery has
been introduced, with 15 men and about the same number of fe-
males as before, it produces sixty reams per day. A snuff-mill
emp oys 2; and four-corn nillis, one of which is chiefly for wheat
and barley, employ 13 persons. A distillery, at which 5 hands
are employed, consumes 483 imperial quarters of barley, and pro-
duces 11,200 imperial gallons of whisky a year. In the cotton-
factory, the legal time of working is strictly adhered to-twelve
hours a-day for five days of lhhe week, and nine hours on Saturday.
At other employments the usual time of working is ten hours a-
day, but on occasions of extraordinary demand, these hours are
often increased. Good wages are made at most of these employ-

<FOOTNOTE>Deducting from this sum the value of minerals, woods, and orchards, there re.
mains in round numbers L.35,100, as the value of the gross produce of land. The
land rent of the parish is L.11,500, nearly one-third of the produce; which is much
too high a rate, the calculation.being that the land ought to produce four rents to give
a fair profit to the farmer. Considerable allowance, however, must be made for er-
rors in an estimate in which accuracy is obviously not attainable; and we have no
doubt that our estimate of the produce is below, rather than above the truth.
