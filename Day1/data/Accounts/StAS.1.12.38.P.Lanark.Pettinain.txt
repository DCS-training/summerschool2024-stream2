great part of the parish, are generally pretty neat and com- 
modious.  This must contribute to the health, as well as to 
the comfort of the inhabitants. 

   Poor.-The number of poor has been very small, for seve-
ral years past.  This has been owing, among other causes, 
to the care taken by the kirk-session to give a little aid be- 
times, to those that were likely to fall into necessitous cir- 
cumstances; and thus, to prevent their coming upon the poor's 
list.  It is too often found that many of those, who are accus-
tomed to a regular supply, become idle and improvident.  By 
losing their sense of independence, they lose regard to cha- 
racter.  The manner of supporting the poor, in this part of 
Great Britain, though it be well calculated to check these 
evils, cannot altogether prevent them.  When a small assist- 
ance, seasonably administered, will enable a poor man to con-
tinue his occupation, and to earn his bread for many years, 
it is certainly much better to afford it, than, by allowing him 
to sink into extreme poverty and wretchedness, to be obliged 
to admit him as a constant pensioner.  The price of meal was 
so much raised in consequence of the great frost in harvest 
1782, that it was thought necessary to give some temporary 
assistance to a number of the poorer class of people in this 
parish.  Meal, and beef (which was then cheaper than meal) 
were sold to them considerably below the market price, till, 
by the next plentiful harvest, provisions were brought down 
to their ordinary rate.  The same plan, to a smaller extent, 
was adopted in the end of 1784, another hard year: and, by 
these means, the distress, in which several industrious persons 
must have been involved, was prevented.  The annual interest
of 40 L. of stock, together with the ordinary collections, mort-
cloth-money, etc. has hitherto been sufficient for the support 
of the poor.
