parents, and whom nothing but dire necessity could induce to al-
low those so dear to them to become dependent on foreign aid.
   Besides the above provision for the poor, the late benevolent
ladies, Katharine Lady Blantyre, and her sister, Miss Lindesay of
Eaglescarnie, left L. 100 each,-or, after deducting the legacy-
duty, L. 180, for the relief of persons in distress, the interest to
be given irrespective of the ordinary allowance. This has been
hitherto expended in affording occasional relief, in supplying coals,
and in paying the school fees of children whose parents stand in
need of such aid.
   Fuel.-This district is abundantly supplied with coals from Pen-
ston, Pencaitland, and Huntlaw, which are within a moderate
distance from every part of the parish.

                  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   In the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is stated that
there were about 150 acres in wheat,-there are now nearly 300:
That ploughmen had ordinarily L. 14 Sterling a-year,-now they
have from L. 23 to L. 25. The rent is stated to have been L. 1400,
-it is now about double that sum; and during the high war prices
it was considerably more.
   Great attention has long been applied to that first of agricul-
tural improvements-draining; and much money has been ex-
ponded on it. Still, owing to the difficulty of the soil; many farms
were but imperfectly drained. The new system, however, called
the frequent drain system or furrow draining, bids fair to bring this
operation to perfection, and to alter almost entirely the character
of many farms. This system is carried on at present with great
spirit in this neighbourhood. It must be a great addition to the
durability of these drains, when the tiles are covered with gravel, or
small stones, which is not always done.
