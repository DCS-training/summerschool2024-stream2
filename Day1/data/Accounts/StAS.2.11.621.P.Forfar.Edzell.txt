                        PARISH OF EDZELL.

	PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

              THE REV. ROBERT INGLIS, MINISTER.*

               I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.-The name is written Edzell or Edzel, and in the old
records, often Edziel. It is pronounced Aigle or Eagle. It is
supposed to be a Gaelic word signifying the cleft, or dividing of
the waters.
  The main body of the parish is a peninsula, betwixt the two
branches of the North Esk, here named the North and West
Waters, which unite at the bottom of the parish.
  Edzell forms the north-east point of Forfarshire, the lower part
bounded by Fettercairn and Strackathrow; the middle by Lethnot
on the west; and the part in Kincardineshire bounded by
Fettercairn on the east; the upper or water side by Lochlee, on
the west; and the north, by Strachan and Birse in Kinear-
dineshire.
  The peninsula is about three miles long, by two wide.  Above
that, the parish swells into about four miles in width. Beyond,
the parish stretches up the north water, on both sides, six or
seven miles.  The form is very irregular.

                  II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
  Lindsay or Lindesay of Edzell was proprietor of six-sevenths of
the parish. The family were powerful, and appear to bave acted
under their kinsmen, the Earls of Crawfurd.  To Lindsay be-
longed Edzell, Lethnot, and Lochlee, with domains towards Fin-
haven, upon the one hand, and Brechin upon the other; which
seem to have been parted with, before the final breaking up of the
family.  As a proof of pristine superiority, the lands of Edzell are
at this day exempted from paying custom at the great Trinity June
fair of Brechin.
