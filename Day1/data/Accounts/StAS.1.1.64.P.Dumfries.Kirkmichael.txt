     Statistical Account

   About six years ago, there was found, in a small piece of
peat moss, near the line of the road above mentioned, a pretty
large pot, of a sort of base copper, and a decanter of the
same metal, of the shape and size of of our white stone quart
decanters, with three feet, about 1 1/2 inch long.  They were 
both sent by Dr Burgess to the Society of Antiquaries at
Edinburgh, and are in their museum.  They were thought
to be Roman.  They might have been thrown into the place
where they were found when the Romans left the castellum,
perhaps pursued by the natives, and obliged to abandon some
of their heavy baggage, to expedite their flight.
