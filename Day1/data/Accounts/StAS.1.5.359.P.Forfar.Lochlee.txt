   Climate and Diseases.-The climate varies in different
parts of the parish.  Although much colder than in the low
country, yet, in the east end of the parish, it is more tem-
perate and warmer than in the west end, where the win-
ter snow frequently lies upon the hills, until the end of
May, and sometimes the middle of June.  The air is rec-
koned healthy; the inhabitants are not subject to fevers of
any kind, nor is there any other disease peculiar to the
place.  The ague never makes its appearance in any form,
within the bounds of the parish, although that disease is
common, in the adjoining parishes of Fettercairn and Ed-
zell.  In May 1782, after an exceeding cold and wet
spring, the wind blowing generally from N. E. a fever
made its appearance in the parish, which, in the space of 6
weeks, cut off 35 persons.  It was attended with symptoms
similar to what accompanies an inflammation of the Pleura:
The persons affected had their spittle mixed with blood,
within a few hours after the fever seized them; they felt
a pain at or below their left pap; and died upon the 5th
or 6th day.  The pain, however, did not affect their
breathing so much; nor did it feel so acute as is common-
ly the case in a pleuritic fever.  The greater part of those
who died, were 30 years of age an upwards; they were
all above 18.  Two only recovered of all that were seized.
It is not remembered that a fever, similar to the above,
has happened in the parish.

   Population.-From an account taken in 1723, when
Lochlee was disjoined from Lethnot, there appears then to
have been, 400 examinable persons in the parish; in 1766,
the number of souls in it amounted to 600; at present
(1792) there are 178 men, 237 women, and 193 children
below 12 years of age, making in all 608 souls.  Al-
though, from the above statement, it might be concluded,
