   Digging pits for gravel to mix with dung is an uni-
versal but pernicious practice in this parish.  It not only de-
forms the country, and destroys, the natural pasture, but ren-
ders the land for ever incapable of improvement, where
pitted, with little or no benefit to the land on which the
gravel is laid.  Cutting seal and divot is another hurtful
practice, though not peculiar to this parish, but it would be
extremely oppresive in proprietors to prohibit it altoge-
ther, without giving the poor a substitute for building and
thatching their houses.
