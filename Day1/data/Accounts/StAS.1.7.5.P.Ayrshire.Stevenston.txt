doubted vestige of ancient plowed ridges) is frequently laid
open to the eyes on the tides of the canal and other deep
drains.

   A steep ridge of rocky ground, the greater part of which
is now covered with soil, runs for two miles nearly in a
straight line from west to east, between there two tracks of
the parish, and suddenly raises the upper plain to a consider-
able height above the lower.  On the west end of this
ridge, where it dips into the sea, is the town of Saltcoats,
built on the rocks.  More than a mile east, immediately
under the ridge, is the town of Stevenston, adorned with
trees, and two gentlemen's houses, with their parks at some
distance, one on each side of it.  All the rest of the plain,
considerably elevated to the east, exhibits a waste and dreary
prospect of land, which blows in some places, and is pre-
vented only by the deep-rooted bent growing through it,
from being reduced to a dead level.  At present, the sand-
hills or mounds are continually sinking, and laying open to
the eye the spires of Irvine, and other land objects, never
seen before.  In a course of time, the inland part of these
sands, raised by the storms from the sea, will cover a little
more of our cultivated ground; and the outer part of them,
undermined by the spring tides, and blown by the dry N. E.
winds, will gradually raise the bottom, and narrow the
bounds of the sea, which has in fact retired in a very sensible
manner within the last 30 years*.

*There is little ground to doubt, that these and the other
adjoining tracks of sand consist of the soil of the upper coun-
try, carried by land floods down the large rivers of Irvine
and Garnock into the sea, beaten back again incessantly by
the tides, and thus reduced, to their present state and form,
At every land flood, the sea appears to the eye brown and
