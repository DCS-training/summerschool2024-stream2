     of Mochrum.

   Very few, however, of this truly primitive breed, it is sup-
posed, now remain; they have been either picked out, and
fold off in quantities to those who were pursuing improve-
ments in wool, or contaminated with the various other kinds
of sheep in the neighbourhood.
   But, though thus evidently degenerating, the Mochrum
wool (quantity and quality) is still esteemed the best in the
county, and is generally sold from 12 s. to 14 s. a stone,
When it is carried to the manufactories of Kilmarnock and
Glasgow.
   A few years ago, Lord Daer and Admiral Stewart pur-
chased here some of the native ewes, in order to try a breed
between them and Spanish, Shetland, and other rams; but
both these public spirited noblemen were unfortunately cut
off by death, while engaged in this and many other patriotic
experiments for the improvement of their country.
   The number of sheep is considerably diminished since the
late improvements here.  The whole stock, at present, is not
more than 5000.  Being very hurtful to young thorn hedges,
they are, with great propriety, forbidden to be kept where-
ever the fields are inclosed with these.  As they are, there-
fore, mostly banished to the moor-lands, they are neither
large nor fat; but, when brought from thence, and fed on
good pasture for a year, they improve greatly, and are ac-
counted the very best of mutton.  On their ordinary soil,
the wadders are sold, when 4 years of age, at 10 s. a head,
and are mostly driven to Ayr or Glasgow; and the ewes, as
they become old, are killed for home consumption.

   Swine.-Almost every farmer keeps 2 or 3 pigs, and every
householder one; so that there is an abundance, if not an
over abundance, of these animals.  They are chiefly fed on
potatoes and the offal of the kitchen, and sold to English
butchers, when a year old, at 30 s. and 40 s.
