   Surface, Hills.-The surface of the parish is very irregu-
lar.  Its southern boundary upon the Tay to the eastward,
is bold and steep, which ends in the rocky promontory of
Kingoody.  From that point a beautiful bank rises, and as
it proceeds north and west, it tales the shape of a crescent,
and ends in a bluff point, at a place called the Snabs of
Drimmie, about 3 miles from its beginning, below which,
and between it and the river Tay, the surface is a perfect
plain, its lowest part upwards of 20 feet above the bed of
the river, and forms the easternmost part of that fertile vale.
well known by the mane of the Carse of Gowrie.  About
half a mile north from the village of Longforgan, this bank
sinks into a narrow vale, which runs across the parish, and 
from which rises a range of hills, which may be considered
as part of the Sidlaws.  These divide Strathmore from the
Carse of Gowrie, and end at Perth.  There are three re-
markable hills in this parish, Dron, Ballo, and Lochtown.
The first is 667 feet; the second, 992 feet; and the last, 
1172 feet above the level of the sea.

   Rivers, Fishings, and Rivulets.-There is no river con-
nected with this parish but the Tay, which bounds it on
the south for nearly three miles.  It is here between two
and three miles broad, and when the side ebbs, it leaves
near a mile of dry sand between its bank and the stream or
current of the river.  At present, the river Tay is famous
for its excellent salmon, from Errol upwards; and again,
where it narrows near the Castle of Broughty, about three
miles below Dundee; but none are caught now where it 
bounds this parish; although formerly there might have
been some, as the right of fishing for salmon is attached by
