ed in the most slovenly and irregular manner, with implements
the most unsuitable, and which was generally called for when they
had most to do at home; day's wages are now paid, regular
hours for work are kept, and proper implements employed. The
old fences, constructed partly of stone and Partly of turf, which
were kept up in a banging and standing condition, and required
a thorough repair every year, are replaced by substantial stone
dikes with stone coping. The practice of letting farms to four
or eight tenants in common, the evils of which are well known, is
almost entirely discontinued ; and the advantages of subdivisions,
and a regular rotation of cropping, are fast developing in the im-
prnved condition of the land, and stock fed thereon. The absence
of middlemen or gentlemen farmers, who would be admissible to
the society of the landlord, and, at the same time, share in the
sympathies of the people, is sensibly felt in this and the adjoining
districts. Wherever this link between the tipper and lower classes
has been found wanting, throughout the Highlands, jealousy,
distrust, and discontent are almost always found to prevail, what-
ever other means may be used to promote the well-being of the
people.
