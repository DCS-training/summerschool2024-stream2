ther small articles.-The old kirk of Kilmaveonag was lately
rebuilt, and converted into an episcopal chapel.

   The schoolmaster's salary amounts, in sterling money, to
15 l.; of which the heritors pay 10 l. and the bishop rents 5 l.
The number of scholars, at an average, is from 86 to 90,
boys and girls.
   There is a society school at Strowan, where one of the kirks
stands, in which the number of scholars in winter amounts
generally, in boys and girls, to 70.  The teacher's salary is
at present 10 l.  Some time ago there were three more cha-
rity schools here, which are now withdrawn.  In some se-
questered corners, the people are obliged to hire some one
to teach their children during the winter and part of spring.

   The poors' fund at interest is 225 l. sterling.  The num-
ber of poor, at an average, amounts to from 74 to 78.

   I am credibly informed, that it was in these united pa-
rishes that the famous Montrose first erected his standard;
and it is well known that 700 or 800 Atholians fought along
with him till after the battle of Kilsyth.  They were gene-
rally commanded by Colonel Alexander M'Donald of the
island of Colonsay, commonly called Alastair Mac Colla.
