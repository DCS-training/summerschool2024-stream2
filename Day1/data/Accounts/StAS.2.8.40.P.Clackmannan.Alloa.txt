others similar to it, he increased his acquaintance with the prin-
ciples of grammar, and acquired that accurate classical know-
ledge, for which he was afterwards so eminently distinguished.
   Dr James Fordyce,--the eloquent author of " Sermons to young
Women," and "Adresses to young Men," was minister of Alloa,
from 1753 till 1760, when he removed to London.
   Bishop Alexander.--Upon the east wall of the churchyard was
a marble tablet to the memory of Bishop Alexander, who died,
April 24,1776, aged 82 years. This tablet is now removed to the
new Episcopal chapel. The reputation of Bishop Alexander still
lives in the church, and he continues to be spoken of as a person
of apostolical simplicity, piety, and benevolence. The small cha-
pel, in which he officiated at Alloa, was beque thed by him to
his successors in that town. He was thirty-three years Bishop
of Dunkeld.

   Parochial Registers.--The register of baptisms and marriages,
as well as the books of discipline, commence in February 1609;
but all of tbem prior to 1664 are in a bad state of preservation,
having apparently been much exposed to damp, and otherwise
carelessly kept. The books of discipline or records of session are
incomplete, from 1746 till 1760, there being only the records of
six years between these two periods; but from 1760 to the pre-
sent time, they are complete. The number of births registered
for five years from 1699, averages 103; for five years from, 1799,
the average is 138; and for the five years preceding 1840, the
average is 119. The number of marriages for the same periods
averages respectively 29 5/3, 33, and 61 2/3.
   If any opinion of the increase of population may be formed from
the number of children's names recorded in five years succeeding
1610, viz. 224, annual average, 444 4/5; and from the number in five
years succeeding 1680, viz. 490, annual average, 98,-it must be
supposed that the population had more than doubled in the inter-
val of seventy years; and as there were no Dissenters at either of
those periods, it is probable that all children were registered. It is
