were to be found, and only for the summer months, a few
light sheep and goats, small hill horses, as they were called,
and some herds of black cattle.  Then, it was believed,
that no domestic animal could stand the severities of the win-

sheep were regularly housed and fed in pens, during the
rigour of the season.  The consequence was often fatal.
When the provender was consumed before the genial return

with ash, birch, and aller.  On the sides of Lochow, especially

*A worthy gentleman, still alive in this parish, was present at the sale of
510 hides of black cattle, of all ages; which were the property of one laird, and
lost in one season, by mere want.  This was in the year 1744.  The hides sold for
50 L. to a Glasgow tanner.
