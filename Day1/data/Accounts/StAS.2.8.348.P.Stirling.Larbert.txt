Hall, stands a Wych elm, of singular beauty, which, at 5 1/2 feet
from the ground, girths 166 inches, or nearly 14 feet. There are
also several Huntingdon willows of nearly 12 feet girth. The
timber of the Huntingdon willow is of great value, combining
toughness with lightness; and, in the deep soil of the Carse, the
growth is so rapid, that a willow having been cut down in the year
1806, two shoots were allowed to remain till the spring of 1821.
The remaining tree now girths 70 inches, and contains at least 45
feet of timber. In the light soil of the upper part of the parish,
the Huntingdon willow does not grow to so great a size as in the
Carse.  We subjoin a note of the growth of six trees, measured
at different periods, to ascertain the rate of increase.

   It is worthy of remark, that the two beeches stand within 20
feet of each other, and that No. 1 continues to thrive, whilst its
neighbour has a less healthy appearance.
   Bishop Watson says, as soon as a tree is worth a guinea, the
most profitable plan is to cut it down.  This we may suppose to
have been an oak of seven to eight feet, solid measure; and such
the Bishop, who took great pleasure in his woods, deemed ripe
for the axe.
   The oak in this climate does not grow to the size which it at-
tains in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Berkshire, Hampshire, and
other parts of England. There was, however, 50 years ao, a re-
markable oak in this neighbourhood on the lands of Blairs, two miles
north of Larbert.  It was called Wallace's tree. When I saw it
about 1794, there remained only a part of the outer shell and

<FOOTNOTE>The Huntingdon willow, Salix alba of Linnaeus, called in some parts of England
the Leicestershire willow. There is another species of tree willow in this part of the
country, which grows to a considerable size, but does not afford such straight well-
formed timber as the Huntingdon willow. The Huntingdon willow is propagated
by cuttings, which are poles of about seven feet in length. A hole, of a foot or eigh-
teen inches in depth, and just wide enough to admit the pole, is made by means of a
cylindrical iron bar, or by a large kitchen poker, which is rammed into the ground,
so as to form a hole, and into the hole the thick end of the pole is inserted, and is fix-
ed by pressing inwards the sides of the hole.
