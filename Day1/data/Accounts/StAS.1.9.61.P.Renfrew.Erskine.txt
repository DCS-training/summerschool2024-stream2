   Climate and Diseases.-Although a considerable quantity
of rain falls here, as in all other places on the western side
of the island, the air cannot properly be called moist, and may
be pronouced upon the whole healthy.  By the light soil,
and gravelly bottom, the water is soon absorbed, or it runs
off by the hollows ; and as any hollow, or flat pieces of
ground, which are not ploughed, are always compleatly co-
vered with grass, there are no unwholesome marshes.  A-
gues, dysenteries, and such other diseases as are occasioned
bu noxious efftuvia from the soil, are scarcely known by
name.  The most prevalent distempers are severs, arising
from cold and other causes.  These at times become in some
degree epidemic, or to thro' a considerable number of families.
These epidemics are hardly ever of a very malignant nature,
and seldom above 3 or 4 persons die in the course of them.
They are probably spread and aggravated more than they
would otherwise be, from two causes, both of which, how-
ever, are gradually diminishing :  1st, From large families
being often crowded together in small houses, where too
little attention is given to cleanliness and ventilation ; and,

their duty frequently to visit their neighbours when in dis-
tress.  Hence it happens, that the place in which the sick
persons are lying is frequently crowded with people, the
patients are stilled, and the infection is spread.  These epi-
demic fever appear at the rate of about once in 2 or 3
years.  The small-pox still makes occasionally confiderable
ravages among the children, as the people are only begin-
ning to overcome their prejudices against inoculation

   Ferries-There are 2 ferries across the Clyde in this pa-
rish. One of them, called the East Ferry, or Ferry of Er-
skine, is nearly opposite to the village of Kilpatrick, and
serves for transporting horses and carriages, as well as foot-
