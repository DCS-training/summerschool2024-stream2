     NUMBER XVII.

     PARISH OF STONEHOUSE.

     (COUNTY OF LANARK.)

     By the Rev. MR. JAMES MOREHEAD.

     Situation and Extent.

   The parish of Stonehouse is in the county of Lanark, in
the presbytery of Hamilton, and synod of Glasgow and
Ayr;-18 miles from Glasgow,-7 and a half from Hamilton,
and nearly the same from Lanark.  It is 5 miles in length,
and, at an average, nearly 2 miles in breath.  No exact sur-
vey has yet been taken of it; but, by comparing what has been
surveyed, and what has not, it may be reasonably supposed to
contain nearly 6000 acres.  Of the above, it is computed, that
about 12 acres consist of moss, and about 24 of muir.  All
the rest is arable, excepting the banks of the river.  The soil,
at the top of the parish, is light; in the middle and lower end,
it is also light, but mixed with some clay.  It is laid out most-
ly in small farms.  Four or five,perhaps, may pay between
60 and L. 80 of yearly rent; but, at an average, they do not
exceed 20 or L. 30.-In the centre of the parish, there is a
very thriving village, called Stonehouse.  In the course of the
last 20 years, 35 new houses have been built; and 2 or 3
more are to be built next summer.  Some of these houses con-
