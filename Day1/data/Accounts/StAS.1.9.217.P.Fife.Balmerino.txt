trary, the people may be laid to be healthy.  There were
4 persons who died within these 10 years upwards of 90;
and there are several now alive above 80 years of age.
The wholesomeness of the climate appears also from the
fruitfulness of the females.  The present incumbent has
often, in the course of 10 years, had an opportunity of
baptizing twins; and there are 2 families in it at present,
1 of whom has had thrice twins, and the other has five
sons, now alive, at 2 births:  The twins are youngest, and
were baptized in the 1789.

are for the most part dry.  The soil in general is thin and

begun to be better understood), though indeed it is to
be wished that the Highland, or some other society, would
pay attention to that great improvement in agriculture, by
offering a premium for the best essay on the most effectual

now generally carried on by two horses, managed by one
servant with a pair of long reins, and oxen are seldom
yoked; yet some keep and work them both in the plough,
by themselves, and in carriages.  In cropping, some adopt

first years for hay, and the 2 last laid out into pasture, oats,
barley, green crop, or summer fallow, with a top dressing
