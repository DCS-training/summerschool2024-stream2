times animals of less value. There are no forests in the parishi
and till lately there were very few plantations. Within the last
twenty years, about 300 acres have been planted, chiefly Scotch
and larch fir. In some cases, there is a mixture of hard-wood. The
soil would bear any trees except those which are partial to cold clay.
II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
.Land-owners.-The chief land-owners are, the Marquis of
Northampton, and Thomas Bruce, Esq. late of the Customs. The
rest are chiefly feuars of from a-half acre to land worth 1.,. 400 per
annum.
Parochial Registers.-The parochial register commences in
1703. The records previous to that time are said to have been
accidentally burnt. In so far as the affairs of the poor, and the
record of proclamations are concerned, they have been regularly
kept; but the register of baptisms is very incorrect, as Dissenters
have in general been very remiss in getting the names of their
children entered, and till very lately there was no register of
funerals.                                                         I
,Antiquities, 8fc.-There are no antiquities in the parish known
to the writer, except the ruins of a priory on the island of Servanus,
and of a chapel at Scotland-well. A short time ago, the metal
fieads of some spears and a shield were found in the cut for drain-
ing the lake. The were sent as curiosities to London.
