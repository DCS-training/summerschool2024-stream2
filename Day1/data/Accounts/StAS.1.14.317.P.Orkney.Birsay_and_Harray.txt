marble, little is to be got in this parish, if any.  What
we call flag, which is a thick kind of slate as also a
thinner kind of coarse grey slate, both of which are u-

but none peculiar to this parish, all being found in the
bold shores round Scotland.-The parish of Birsay is
not more famous for a breed of black cattle than any of
the neighbouring parishes; they are small, and gene-
