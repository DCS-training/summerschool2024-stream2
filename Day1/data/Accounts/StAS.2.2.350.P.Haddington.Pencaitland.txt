the foundation of several families of great distinction through the
rest of Scotland."
   Landed Proprietors.-The Right Honourable Lady Ruthven
is the principal proprietor and patron of the parish. Her Lady-
ship's family. (the Hamiltons of Pencaitland) have been long in
possession of that estate, to the great advantage of their tenantry,
and all connected with them. Andrew, Fletcher, Esq. of Salton ;
Patrick Dudgeon, Esq. of East Craigs; Sir Thomas Dick Lau-
der, Bart. of Fountainhall; Mrs Johnston Brown of Milton; and
the Right Honourable the Earl of Hopetoun,-are the other
chief proprietors.
  Parochial Registers.-The earliest date of baptisms and mar-
riages is 1598, and of deaths, 1616. From the above dates to
the present time, these registers appear to have been kept, re-
spectively, with great correctness, with the exception of a period
of fifty years in the register of marriages, which is wanting. The
minute book of the kirk-session, from 1633, and the cash book of
transactions in managing the poor's funds, from 1729 till this time,
bear marks of having been kept with much attention. A register
of certificates granted to persons in communion with the Church
when leaving this parish, and also a book containing inventories
of the effects of paupers taken at the time that they were put upon
the roll, have been kept since 1817.
  Antiquities.-In the village of Wester Pencaitland, there is an
old cross, the history of which is not known. It may, however,
(as frequently happens in England,) have marked the distinction
of a market-place. This idea is countenanced by a notice that
was published in the Edinburgh Gazette, from Monday, 21st, till
Thursday, 24th August 1699, in the following terms: " This is
to give notice that two new fairs are to be holden at Wester Pen-
caitland, in the sheriffdom of Haddington, for horse, nolt, sheep,
and all sorts of linen and woollen cloth. The first upon the 4th
of October, and the other on the 8th day of June yearly, free of
customs for three years."

<TABLE=Population>               III.-POPULATION.

		In 1759, the population amounted to 910
		   1791,			    925
		   1801,			    970
	   	   1811,		           1033
		   1821,			   1145
		   1831,			   1166
   From this statement it appears that the population has not fuc-
tuated much in point of numbers for the last eighty years. There
is a small increase from the time of the census in 1831.
