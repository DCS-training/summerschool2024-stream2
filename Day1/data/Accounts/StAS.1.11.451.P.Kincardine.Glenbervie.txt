   Rents and Leases.-The valued rent is 3,336 L.  Scotch; the
real or present rent about 1000 L.  Sterling, which could be
nearly doubled, were the lands to be let immediately.  But
as many of the leases are of an old date, the rents at present
paid are low, and the industriuos judicious tenant is in a thriv-
ing state.  The tenants, especially on the lands belonging to
Lord Monboddo, are in this agreeable situation.  They hold
their farms on easy, and, perhaps, peculiar terms; and, from
this circumstance, and the countenance of his Lordship, they
have the greatest encouragement to industry.  Their leases
are, probably, of an uncommon nature; being, a life, 19
years, and a life: The possessor, during the 19 years, names
the life with which the lease ends.

<FOOTNOTE>

*No certain conclusion, as to the increase or decrease of the population, can
be drawn from thus average, as the register of baptism is very imperfect.  This,
in a great degree, is owing to the carelessness of the parents about the registra-
tion of their childrens names, and their backwardness to pay the tax.

   +Of there only 1 resides in the parish.

   In this number, those who have small pieces of ground, and neighbour, as
they call it, with others in plowing, are not included.

ated.
