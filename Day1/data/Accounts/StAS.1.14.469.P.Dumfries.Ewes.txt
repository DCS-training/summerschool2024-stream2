     Of Ewes

At this period, it does not exceed 320.  This decrease is
owing, in some measure; to the difficulty the poor find in
procuring fuel; but mostly to the situation of the farms,
which are generally, and at a less expense, managed by ser-
vants residing in the tenants houses, than by herds having
houses and families of their own.

   School.-There ia a parish school, which is regularly
taught; the salary of which is 8 l. 6 s. 8 d., which, toge-
ther with 3 l. for collecting the poor's rates, and 1 l. as
precentor and session-clerk, makes the whole something
above 12 l. a year.  The other emolouments are so small,
that I do not think the present teacher, who is married,
and has 5 children, 4 sons and 1 daughter, can draw more
than 17 l.  He has house, which, together with the
school-house, has been this last season rebuilt, at a consi-
derable expense; but there is no garden.

   Stipend, &c.-The stipend annexed to the living, con-
sists of 47 l. some odd shillings, in money, 5 l. 11 s. 1 1 8/2 d.
for communion elements, and 3 chalders of victual, 2 of
meal and 1 of barley.  No augmentation has taken place
since the year 1655, when the decreet was obtained from
the Court of Session.  The glebe, till within these few
months, contained about 14 English acres, and the pas-
turage of 40 sheep upon a farm belonging to the Duke of
Buccleugh.  This pasturage has, by his Grace's goodness,
been valued, and land set apart contigous to the old
glebe, by which it now consists of about 3 l acres of the
same measure.  The church and manse are both old; and
being nearly ruinous, stand much in need of repair.
