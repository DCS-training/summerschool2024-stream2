     Statistic Account

Some tenants had not only cottagers, as at present, under 
them, but parcelled out part of their farms to subtenants
who also had cottagers under them.
   But the chief cause of the decrease of population is scar-
city of fuel.  That necessary article of life, which half a
century ago was tolerably plenteous, has of late years be-
come extremely scarce.

   Character and Manners of the People-The inhabitants of
this parish are in general sober, peaceable, and indusrious.
Crimes of an attrocious nature are extremely rare, or rather
unknown among them.  Though they are far from being
unsocial, but have pretty frequent convivial meetings, as at
weddings and the like, yet, after spending some hours chear-
fully together, they separate in a peaceble and friendly
manner.  Drinking to excess and quarrelling are accounted
reproachful, and, therefore, persons addicted to these vices
are avoided.  They appear to be satisfied with their condi-
tion; and most of them are easy in their circumstances ac-
cording to their stations, nay, some of them have even made
a litle money.  But it must also be acknowledged, that some,
from want of industry and oeconomy, and some from mis-
fortune, or from having very large families, are in very
straitened circumstances.  They are very ready, according to
their abilities, to relieve the indigent and distressed, especial-
ly such as have been reduced to that condition by calamity
or misfortune.  They are fair and honest in their dealings,
and obliging to one another.
   In their manners they shew a good deal of attachment to
old fashions and habits.  Though, from their frequent inter-
course with people that speak the English language, it might
be expected that they would have acquired some knowledge
of it, yet the Gaelic continues in general use among them.
