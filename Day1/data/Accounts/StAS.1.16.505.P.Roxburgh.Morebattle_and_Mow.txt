are to be found.  The salmon in these, and all the other
waters in this district of the county, are not now nearly so
plenty as formerly; owing, it is believed, to the cruives,
and other machineries placed in the Tweed, a little above
Berwick, by which the fish, in their passage up the river,
are intercepted and killed.

   Village.-The only village in the parish is Morbattle.
The ground upon which it is built was, not very many
years ago, feued out by the Marquis of Tweeddale, for the
terms of nineteen times nineteen years, at the rate of L. 5
per acre English.  The houses, which are mostly of one
story high, and covered with thatch, are built and kept in
repair by the feuers.  About 380 acres, adjoining to the
village, were, till of late, occupied in two farms, for which
was paid L. 64 of rent annually.  These farms, at the ex-
piration of the leases, were parcelled out into small por-
tions, as might best suit the conveniency of the feuers in the
village.  They are now subdivided into about 26 small
pendicles or paffles, for which is paid of yearly rent L. 230.
The greatest subdivision pays only L. 22, l0 s. Sterling.
The rise of the rent of this land, which was almost altoge-
ther outfield and hilly, is, perhaps, more than that of any
other part of the parish.  The ground, instead of being
rendered worse by the small occupiers, is much improved.
It receives a considerable quantity of manure, and care is
taken to cultivate every inch of it, in the best manner pos-
sible.  Being thus improved, it is extremely serviceable in
helping to support many industrious families.  This village,
when the accumulation of small into large farms took place
in the neighbourhood, seasonably afforded a comfortable a-
sylum to several farmers and cottagers, who were forced
to abandon the abodes of their forefathers.  The inhabi-
tants, who amount to about 200 souls, are active and in-
