                         III.-POPULATION.
      Dr Webster is said to have stated the population in 1755 at
   994 souls. The baptism register shows an average of about 35
   births annually during the first twenty years of last century, while
   before and after the said date of 1755, the average appears redu-
   ced to 29. According to the present proportion between the po-
   pulation and the number of births, this would indicate the popula-
   tion to have been nearly -at the former period what it was found to
   be at last census, and greater at the latter period than Dr Web-
   ster's report makes it appear. But the proportion of births to the
   population must have been greater then than now, in consequence
   of the new agricultural economy employing chiefly unmarried ser-
   vants. This reconciles the state of the fact, as recorded by Dr
   Webster,with the large number of births -appearing at the same
   period inthe register, and forbids us to estimate the population at
   the more remote period at above 1100 or 1200. It thus appears,
   however, that a decrease had taken place during the former half of
   last century. Accordingly, there appears to have been anciently a
   number of hamlets in the lower part of the parish, in places which
   are now wholly depopulated. The introduction of large farms,
   joined to the exclusion of the families of servants and labourers, has
   operated in reducing the population in the same district to the pre-
   sent day, although more than a compensating increase till recently
   was taking, place in the villages and in the moorland district in the
   south end of the parish.

      A large proportion of the youths are now engaging in trades in
   the neighbouring towns.

        <FOOTNOTE>By the census of 1841 the population is the same as in 1831, to a unit; but there
	is in reality a small decrease, about 15 tinkers happening to be encamped in the parish
        on the day of the enumeration.
