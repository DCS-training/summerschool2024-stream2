conterminous heritors.  For the farm of the size required,
is too small to constitute a farm by itself, for the occupancy
of a practical farmer; it would be necessary for that purpose
too, that it should have accommodation, of separate houses,
which cannot be erected but at an expence disproportionate
to its value:  Either therefore, it must have separate houses,
which (in paying rent for the original outlay and in uphold-
ing) must cost disproportionately dear to the clergyman:
Or the heritor must lye at the mercy of each successive in-
cumbent, who may refuse to rent the farm unless at an in-
adequate price.  As no arrangement can possibly be formed
to ensure such accommodation, the clergy in country pa-
rishes must continue to farm their glebes in the dispropor-
tionately expensive and embarrasing modes already stated.
   I must, however, still revert to the scheme suggested,
(p. 400-1) as the most preferable mode of accommodation,
viz. the augmentation of the glebe to the proper size of a farm;
with a proportional reduction of the stipend.  Yet from the un-
productive state in which the lands of the clergy must
necessarily remain, from the insecurity of their tenure, it
would certainly be expedient to render them alienable, ac-
cording to the plan suggested (page 402) so soon as the
state of population and subdivision of employment, rendered
it no longer necessary for the accommodation of the clergy-
man to possess land-a state to which the majority of coun-
try parishes cannot be expected to arrive in the course of cen-
turies to come, if at all.-What is suggested, just now, na-
turally leads to the inquiry,
   III, What is the best mode of supplying such inducement to the
Clergy, as small lead them to the permanent improvement of their
glebes?-In regard to want of inducement, the glebes of the
clergy stand in even a worse situation, as to chance of im-
provement, than lands vested in corporate bodies.  Even
