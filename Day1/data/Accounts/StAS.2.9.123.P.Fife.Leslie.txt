  The manner of living has been very much altered within the
last 40 years. In the year 1826, there was but one butcher, and
he only killed a cow occasionally; now there are three who kill an
ox, each, every week, and meet with a very ready sale. Wheaten
bread is now much more generally used than oaten. This may be
from the most of the women being occupied either in the mills, or
Winding the pirns for the weaver. They find their time better oc-
cupied in this than preparing food for the family, and so purchase
at the shops.
  The improvement that has taken place in the building of the
houses is very decided. The walls are built of neat squared whin,
and rybats, corners, skews, and chimney-tops of ashler work of free-
stone, the roof either tile or slate, the interior of four apartments,
very comfortably and substantially finished.
  The greatest improvements made in the parish of late years are
on the lands of Strathendry, by enclosing, planting, new roads, gar-
den, and policy and house; and the improvements are still carry-
ing on with great spirit, in improving and reclaiming wet land. One,
instance may be stated of the result of the landlord's improvements.
A field that usually let for L. 15 or L. 20 per annum previous to
being drained,-the first year that it was let in grass after the im-
provement, brought L. 85 per annum.
