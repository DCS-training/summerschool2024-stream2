     of Lethnot

   consists of 24 lb. English, or 22 lb. Amsterdam.  There is
no common pasture except the hills.

   Disadvantages.  Among the disadvantages to which this
place is exposed, may be reckoned a long continuance of
snow in the spring, by which the operations of husbandry
are interrupted, and the seed-time retarded;  and on this
account, our corns are but seldom so well ripened as those
in the low country.  While good oats in the low country
yield sixteen pecks of meal per boll, we reckon them good
here, if they yield fifteen.  The winters here are always
more severe than in the low country, and our farmers are
often interrupted in their operations by storms, while those
to the southward of the hills can plow and cart.  Besides
they frequently suffer very considerably in severe winters
and springs by the loss of sheep and lambs.  Our distance
from Brechin, which is the nearest market-town being
five computed miles, and the road across the steep hill of
Caterthun, often rendered impassable for horses by the
snow, may be reckoned another disadvantage under which
this country labours.

   Stipend, etc.  The stipend is L. 51, 19 s. Sterling, and
16 bolls oatmeal.  The glebe may be estimated now at
five guineas yearly.  The church is probably two or three
hundred years old.  It was covered with lead until the
year 1742, and then slated.  A minister of the parish, so
many years ago, that neither his name nor the period of
his incumbency is remembered, lived and died a bachelor,
and having money, he bequeathed it to cover the church
with lead.  It is said, that his body lies interred in a stone
coffin in the east end of the church.  As to the manse, it
is but a modern edisice.  It was built about the 1723.  The
King is patron of the parish.
