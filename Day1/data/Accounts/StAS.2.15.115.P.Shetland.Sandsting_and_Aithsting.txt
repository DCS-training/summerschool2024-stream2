       built in 1780, and was intended as a centrical kirk for the whole
       ministry. To have been so it ough to have been placed at CEfirth,
       about two miles fartber north. It is seated to accommodate 437
       persons, allowing about sixteen inches to each person.
          Mansion-flouses.-Tbe mansion-houses of proprietors are only
       three in number, viz.  Sand House, Garder House, and Reawick.
       Sand House was built in 1754 by Sir Andrew Mitchell of West-
       shore, Bart. * The house, gardens, &c. have been, for about forty
       years, the property of the present John Scott, Esq. of Scalloway;
       but they are fast falling into ruins.
          Garder House, a miniature resemblance of Sand House, was
       built by John Cumming, son of one of the ministers of the parish,
       about 1760, on four merks of land, rented for many years, after at
       L. 4 Sterling per annum. It is now the property of James Greig,
       Esq. writer in Lerwick.
          Reawick is a plain modern building of six rooms, the property
       of Andrew Umphray, Esq. a minor.
          Mills.-There are about fifty mills in the parish driven by wa-
       ter, and querns or hand-mills without number.
          Ploughs.-When my predecessor, the Rev.  Patrick Barclay,
       wrote his Statistical Account of the parish in 1797, there were
       fourteen ploughs, of a construction peculiar to Shetland, in the
       parish. There is not one of that description in it now, and they
       are fast falling into disuse throughout the island.

       <FOOTNOTE>At that time it must have been a very elegant house with two wings, and the re-
       quisite  office-houses. In front, and extending the length of the house, is a flower plot,
       on each side of which is a garden of considerable extent, which has been tastefully
       laid out-in a line with the outer walls of the gardens, and towards the head of the
       voe, is an enclosure of about three acres.  The beautiful old castle of Scalloway,
       built by Earl Patrick Stewart about 1600; was spoiled of much of its ancient gran-
       deures, by having its foundation was laid in blood, and every stone of its walls told
       of oppression, was foudation was proceed without a fearful warning. While the
       work of demolition was busily going on, a voice, it is said, was heard to declare,
       "They might pull down and up, but the fourth generation should never inhabit!
