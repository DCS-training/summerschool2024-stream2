180			 WIGTONSHIRE.

From the proportion of Dissenters, and making a deduction for
those of them who do register, I am disposed to think, that the
real average of births may be very nearly 85.

	Character,&c. of the People.--The habits of the Scotch and lrish
portions of the population are very different. The Scotch are gene-
rally provident, endeavouring to promote the comfort of themselves
and their families; and many of them show a desire to live within
their incomes, even when very small. They show also almost uni-
formly a ddsire to have their children clothed and educated. The
Irish come to this parish in great poverty; and, in general, seem but
little desirous of making provision for the future. They do not pay
much attention, in many instances, to clothing, either for themselves
or for their children; and having commonly but very little instruction
themselves, they are certainly not very attentive to the education
of their families. But after having been some time in this country,
their habits change frequently very much, and they acquire a relish
for comfort, and pursue the only means of attaining it. There are in-
stances of some of them having become saving and comfortable in no
long time; but in too many cases, they retain the habits which they
bring with them. Upon the whole, the people do enjoy, in a
reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society. They
were apparently, in a great measure, contented with their situa-
tion and circumstances, showing, at the same time, a laudable de-
sire to improve them, previously to the excitement produced by the
Reform Bill: but since that time there have been evident symp-
toms of discontent and disappointment, and much more in the
village than in the country. The people in their respective sta-
tions are, upon the whole, well informed; and their moral cha-
racter stands high. In the landward part of the parish, there
is much attention paid to the observance of religious duties; and
very little avowed neglect of religious ordinances. In the village,
