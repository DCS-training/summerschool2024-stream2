     of Killearn.

   Attention is beginning to be paid to the breeding of
milch-cows by crossing the Ayrshire with the native breed,
which approaches nearly to the Highland.  The native
cows are generally of a black colour, with white faces;
and weigh, when fat, about 16 stone heavy weight.  The
milk of a cow per day in summer, is commonly about 4 1/2
pints Scotch.  The milk is mostly made into butter, that
brings at an average 9 d. per lb.  The skimmed milk is
made into cheese that is sold from 4 s. to 5 s. per stone.
Grazing cattle for slaughter is, in many parts of the parish,
carried to a considerable extent, and is attended with pro-
fit.  The moorland farms are stocked with about 1400
score of the black and grey faced sheep.  A few Spanish
sheep were, in the beginning of 1793, brought by Mr Dun-
more to Ballikinrain, and are thriving very well.  Horses
for the draught are of the Lanarkshire breed, and are chief-
ly purchased at Glasgow and Rutherglen markets.  Not a
few of the farmers, however, are in the practice of rearing
horses on their farms.  Two-wheeled carts, and waggons
with one horse, are very generally used; but sledges are
found to be necessary in the moorland farms.
   The arable land is in general divided into farms of about
60 acres each.  There are let in leases chiefly of 19 years du-
ration.  The lands in the estate of Killearn are, for the en-
couragement of the farmer, generally let in leases of three
19 years; and the consequences are far from being bad,
for the tenants are, on the whole, doing very well.  Care,
however, is very properly taken by the Lord Chief Baron,
to give this encouragement only to persons of active and in-
dustrious habits, and who have a spirit for agricultural im-
provements.  Long leases to an indolent farmer, even although
at certain terms there may be a proportionated rise in the
rent, only encourages his insuperable indolence.  He seeks
no more than merely to scrape together as much as will
