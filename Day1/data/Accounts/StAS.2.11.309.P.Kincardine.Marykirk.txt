                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	The agricultural improvements of the parish, since the date of
the last Report, have been very great. The land is now mostly
improved, and in a high state of cultivation. That incapabld nf
improvement has been planted with wood, which seems to be ge-
nerally thriving.
	Luthermuir, which, at the time of the last Report, seems to
have been deemed unworthy of notice, being at that time only a
barren moor, is now mostly cultivated, and contains a population,
as already stated, of above 1000. On account however, of the
decline of manufactures, especially the weaving trade, it is begin-
ning to decrease in point of population, but to advance in several
other respects. A few years ago, this place seems to have been
the resort of the destitute and abandoned from almost every parish
in the country. It is pleasing to remark, that it is improving very
fast in point of morality and religion,-persons of a loose charac-
ter having been obliged to leave it from want of work, and the re-
maining inhabitants becoming more alive to their duties both to
God and man.

	May 1842.
