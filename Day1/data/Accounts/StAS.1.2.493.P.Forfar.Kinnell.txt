   School.-The legal salary is 200 merks Scots.  Perquisites
are, for a marriage, 2 s 6 d. for the baptism of a child whose pa-
rents are above the rank of cottagers, 1 s. from cottagers, half a
merk Scots; and for certificates. 4 d.  For teaching English,
1 s, per quarter; for writing and arithmetic, 1 s 6 d; and for
Latin, 2 s.  In the summer, there are from 30 to 40 scholars,
and, in the winter 50 and upwards.

   Poor.-There are, at present, 8 persons on charity, at 4 s.
each per month; besides several others, who get cloaths, shoes,
and coals, once a year.  The sum spent yearly for their sup-
port, is about L. 25 sterling, arising from weekly collections,
seat rents in the church, and the interest of some money be-
longing to them.  The Session is very attentive to their neces-
sities, allows none of them to beg, and pays the schoolmaster
for teaching their children.  But a great many beggars, from
distant places, insest the parish continually.-It has
been said that all the parishes in Scotland, except two or three

country at large?

   Antiquities.-There was a mound of earth lately opened in
the parish, and several human bones found in it of a large size.
There was also an urn, containing burnt human bones.  The
outside of it was ornamented clay, and the inside charcoal.  It
is probable, that the burning of the dead was confined to the
chief ranks, as being both troublesome and expensive.  When
burnt, they were put into earthen urns, as among the Greeks
and Romans, and a barrow of earth thrown up in proportion
to their rank.-Buchanan speaks of a battle, in the reign
of James II. between the Lindsays and Ogilvies, about the
year 1443.  Tradition adds, that the battle was fought near
