     Statistical Account

shore) is called the Court Cave, and two reasons are assign-
ed for the name; one is, that when the lands of Easter
Wemyss were the property of the Colvills, they here held
their baron-court; another, that King James IV. in a fro-
lick once joined a company of gypsies, who were here
making merry, and when the liquor began to operate, the
gypsies, as usual with people of their character, began to
quarrel among themselves; upon this his Majesty attempted
to mediate between the parties, but they, ignorant of the
rank of their new associate, were about to handle him
pretty roughly for his goodness, which obliged the King to
discover himself; in allusion to this affair, the cave was
afterwards ironically called the Court Cave.  There is an-
other cave a little to the east of the castle of Wemyss, and
much about the same distance from the shore as the for-
mer.  This cave, which is about 200 feet in length, 100
in breadth, and 30 in height, was fitted up about 60 years
ago by a tacksman for a glass-work; but soon after the work
commenced, the man became bankrupt, and the buildings
were allowed to go to ruins.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish derives
great advantage from the abundance of coal; and when
fishing was plenty, living was much cheaper here than in
most places.  One disadvantage which the commercial part
labour under, is the want of a post-office.  Though Dysart,
which is the nearest post-town, is not at a great distance,
yet as letters cannot be answered the same day on which
they are received, without sending them by express to the
office, much inconvenience is thereby occasioned, which
could be easily remedied at a very small expence, as the
post-boy passes through Easter Wemyss on his way to
Leven.
