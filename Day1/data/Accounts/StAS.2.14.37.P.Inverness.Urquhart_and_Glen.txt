Kintail in Ross-shire; and on the West and north-west by the dis-
trict and alpine valley of Strathglass, which lies in the parishes of
Kilmorack and Kiltarlity.
   Topographical Appearances.-Glen Urquhart and Gleninoris-
ton, which are the only transverse valleys branching off from the
north side of Loch Ness, form the principal and most populous
divisions or portions of this parish, the rest being high and moun-
tainous, and resorted to only for pasture, and peat, which consti-
tutes the natural fuel of the district. These glens, proceeding in
a south-west and nearly parallel direction, are respectively about
nine and twelve miles long, and are separated by high heathy hills,
which terminate immediately above Loch Ness, in the great round-
backed mountain of Maulfuarmhonvie, or Mealfuarvonie, (lite-
rally, the height or lump of the cold moor,) whose dome-shaped
summit attains an elevation of 3200 feet; while, in the opposite
direction, these valleys usher us to the plain of Corrymony and the
ridges overhanging Strathglass on the one hand, and on the other
to the great moorland or table-ground which stretches around
Loch Cluany and the bases of the peaked mountains of Kintail.
    Glenmoriston, except near its mouth, where it is flat and deeply
sunk among the high steep pine and birch-clad hills which rise ab-
ruptly on both sides of it, is an inclined valley, expanding in width
as we ascend, and displaying in great extent and luxuriance the
rounded forms and lively green of a birch forest, which stretch far
up the mountain sides from the dark and mingled masses of native
pine, oak, and roan-tree lining the rocky banks of the impetuous
torrent, which forces its tortuous course along the centre of the
glen. It is hence but little cultivated, and the district is almost
exclusively a pastoral one. The lower parts of the valley, indeed,
are almost entirely covered with birches, and towards the interior
the hills are crowned with noble woods of the Scotch fir or pine.
Urquhart, on the other hand, expands first from the water's of
Loch Ness into a beautiful semicircular plain, divided by regu-
larly shaped fields and hedge-rows, and having all the hill sides
above it beautifully diversified by woods and cultivated grounds,
where persevering labour is seen overcoming all the obstacles of
situation and climate, and carrying tillage to a great elevation. By
the course of the river Coiltie, which waters the southern side of
this plain, the receding and smaller sized stripes of corn ground
are seen extending into the natural domains of the birch tree and
brown heath of the upland pastures; while the Enneric water on
