miles in length, from east to west, and between three and 
four miles in breadth, from fouth to north.  The figure of 
it is regular, being very little intersected by other parishes.
It lies about 8 miles north of Coldstream; 4 fouth-west
of Dunse; 10 north-east of Kelso; and about 15 from the 
sea-ports of Berwick and Eyemouth.

   Rivers.-The river Blackadder, which runs through this
parish, takes its rise out of some mossy grounds in the pa-
rish of Longsormacus, (hence its proper name Blackwater,
vulgarly pronounced Blackadder, or Blackatter).  Soon af-
ter its rise, it is joined by a small rivulet from the parish of 
Westruther, about six miles north-west of Fogo.  It enters
the parish on the west end, and, running east, divides it 
nearly into two parts; from thence continuing its course 
about six miles, falls into the Whitadder, which discharges 
itself into the Tweed three miles above the town of Ber-
wick.  It abounds with a particular species of trout, much
larger than the common burn trout, of an excellent flavour,
and remarkably fat.
   One peculiarity is observed of the Blackadder, that no
salmon can live in it; and if any happen to enter, which
they seldom do, even in the spawning season, they are al-
ways found dead, a little way up from the mouth of the ri-
ver, although the Whitadder, from whence they come into 
it, abounds with them from the Tweed, and carries them
many miles above the place where it meets with the Black-
adder.  Every other stream in this country, communicating 
with the Tweed, has the salmon in great plenty during the 
season.  The above-mentioned source, (the mossy grounds
of Longsormacus), is commonly ascribed as the reason why 
that fish cannot freque t the river.
