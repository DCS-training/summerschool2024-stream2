from 1829 to 1834, inclusive, was 29.802 inches; but we may
now remark, that if the mean height of the instrument be deriv-
ed from the observations from 1814 to 1822, inclusive, it would
somewhat exceed the former result, being 29.857 inches.  It may
be added, that the difference between this mean, and the mean
of the highest altitude, viz. 30.755, is only .898 inches; whereas
the difference between it and the mean of the lowest altitudes, viz.
28.569, is l.298 inches.  Hence it appears that the aberrations
of the barometrical pressures from either side of the mean, are
greater in defect than in excess, in the case of the annual, as well
as in the case of the monthly results; a state of things, the cause
of which we have already endeavoured to explain.
   2. The Temperature.-The mean temperature of the parish,
as deduced from the annual mean, by Six's thermometer, accord-
ing to observations continued from the beginning of 1829 to the
end of 1834, is 48&deg;. 14. The mean obtained by the annual means,
from observations taken at nine o'clock in the morning, and half-
past eight o'clock in the evening, is 47&deg;. 9. The mean of the an-
nual extremes, derived from the greatest heat and greatest cold,
for each year, is 48&deg; .25; and the mean of the highest and lowest
temperature for the entire period of years is 47&deg; .5. Lastly, the
temperature of the water, drawn from a well of considerable depth,

w`s 48&deg; .9, at the beginning of September.
   The mean temperature of each month, derived from a period
of six years, and consequently from upwards of 180 observations,
is as follows, the means being those of the morning observations.

   It appears that in different years, the month of July possesses
the greatest uniformity of temperature,,and the month of January
the least. The temperature of March, April, and May, especially
that of the last of these months, has a considerable range in dif-
ferent seasons, owing to the v`riable winds which prevail in our
