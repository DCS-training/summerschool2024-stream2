in which several persons might registrate the names of their
children, though they had been born some time before, we
find,

<TABLE>
   In 1611 there were 268 children registered.
      1612            283
      1613            260
      1614            306
      1615            321
      1616            296
      1617            314

   The average number of which 7 years, is 294, which mul-
tiplied by 26, would make the number of souls in Glasgow
7644.  In taking a view of the same register, before and
after the Restoration, in 1660, we find it as follows:

   In 1656            560
      1657            515
      1658            591
      1659            591

   The average number of which, being 564 1/4, multiplied by
the same rule, gives 14,670.

<TABLE>
   In 1660            520
      1661            482
      1662            452
      1663            438

</TABLE>

The average number of which, being 473, makes, by the
same rule, only 12,298.  Whether this decrease in the po-
pulation arose from some cause about the time of the
Restoration, or whether, from some defect in the register
of baptisms, cannot now be determined with precision;
but, if the register is accurate, and to be reckoned a
