     Statistical Account

   In 1792-Manufactories of shawls and cassimirs have been
lately established and brought to wonderful perfection.
   It is estimated that the consumpt of coals in Edinburgh (on
an average) amounts to 500 tons per day.
   In 1763-The Starch manufacture was little known or
practiced; and only about 37,000 pounds weight were ma-
nufactured.
   In 1790-There were several Starch manufactories.  The
quantity entered was about 750,000 pounds weight.-The
increase, 713,000 lib.
   N. B.  A very great proportion of this is used for hair-
powder; but the quantity cannot be ascertained, as the
whole is entered under the denomination STARCH.-
One starch manufacturer has paid at the rate of L.700
of duty, every six weeks.
   In 1763-The revenue arising from the Distillery, in Scot-
land, amounted to L. 4739 :18: 10d.
   In 1783-The revenue arising from the Distillery amounted
to L. 192,000; consequently 600,000 gallons of spirits must at
least have been distilled*.  Since July 1786, the duty has been
levied by license on the contents of the stills.  The quantity
that might reasonably be expected from the number of stills
entered should be thus:
