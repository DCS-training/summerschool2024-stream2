of that river by Dalserf and Hamilton to Glasgow.  This
road, which leads through woods and orchards, and
keeps the Clyde pretty generally in view, bids fair to be
the most beautiful one in Scotland; and were it continued
southerly as once proposed, by the Howgate mouth to
Carlisle, (thereby shortening the present road from Glas-
gow to that place,) it would be of considerable advantage
to Lanark, as at present there is no thorough-fare through
Lanark to any town in Britain.  It will however be mat-
ter of regret, if some attention is not also paid to the old
road by Carluke, as it is the ordinary one to coal and
lime.
   There are two bridges over the Clyde in the parish.
The old bridge of Lanark, consisting of 3 arches, was built
in the end of last century, and is at present strong and suffi-
cient; but from the late great weight of earth laid upon the
abuttment next the town, it is somewhat doubtful whether
it may not be hurt by it.  The other bridge is the Hynd-
ford bridge on the high road from Lanark, and from Edin-
burgh to Ayr.  This bridge, consisting of 5 arches, was
built a few years ago, under the direction of Mr Steven,
and for elegance and simplicity may challenge any bridge
of its size in Scotland.  There are three bridges over the
Mouss, Cleghorn bridge, Lockhart-ford bridge, on the
Carluke road; and Mouss-mill bridge.
   If ever the proposed canal should take place between
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and should the people of Ayr-
shire think of a canal to join it, the southerly tract of
the Glasgow and Edinburgh canal, pointed out by Luci-
us in the Edinburgh Herald, would be the most accom-
modating one towards such junction.  The Glasgow canal
would enter the parish from Carluke; and passing close
on by Cleghorn, might there be joined by the branch
