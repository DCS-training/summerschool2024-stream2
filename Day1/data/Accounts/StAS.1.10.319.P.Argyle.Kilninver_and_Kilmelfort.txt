sheep, have been much improved in these parishes of late

from 8 L. to 12 L.; aged stots from 5 L. to 7 L.; cows from

from 12 s. to 14 s.; slack ewes from 4 s. 6 d. to 6 s. 6 d.;
hogs at 8 s.; lambs at 4 s. and 5 s.; wool at 7 s. per stone,
when white; tarred wool at 5 s. per stone, 24 lib. weight to
the stone.  The old small highland white-faced sheep are
still retained in those parishes by the small tenants; though
less in size, they are finer in the wool, and reckoned more

when fat, at from 6 s. to 8 s.  Six of the farms in the higher
