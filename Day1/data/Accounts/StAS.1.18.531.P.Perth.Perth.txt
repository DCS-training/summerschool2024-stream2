which had belonged to the abbey.  Her tracksman of the
tithes of Perth, was John Ross, laird of Craigie.  He paid a
third part for the purposes enacted, and transmitted the over-
plus to the Queen's Majesty.  The Queen, however, soon
after the year 1600, gave up her right to the tithes of Perth,
and the town council became patrons of the parish.
   From the year 1560, to the year 1595, there was only
one minister in Perth.  From 1595 to 1716, there were
always two ministers, and only one parochial church.  In
the year 1716, the west part of the building, which had
been separated from the rest, by a partition Wall, was ordered
to be seated, and a third minister was called by the magi-
strates.
   The town continued from that time to have 3 ministers,
till the year 1740; in which year, one of the 3 ministers,
was along with some other brethren deposed by the Gene-
ral Assembly, for following what were denominated divisive
courses.  The resolution of passing such a sentence had been
carried by the casting vote of the Moderator of the Assembly.
The brethren who had been deposed, though they were not
allowed to preach in the parochial churches, did not cease
from the exercise of their ministry, but began what is called
the party of Seceders in Scotland, and very soon went farther
in their opposition to the church, than they at first intended.
The deposed minister in Perth, was much beloved by the
people.  A great number of the parishioners attached them-
selves to him, and left the established church, so that the
town council thought there was no longer any need of a third
minister.
   The population of the town, however, continued to in-
crease.  In 1771, the choir of the old building was converted
into a separate church, and an ordained assistant was provid-
ed for the two ministers.  But the remedy was not sufficient,
