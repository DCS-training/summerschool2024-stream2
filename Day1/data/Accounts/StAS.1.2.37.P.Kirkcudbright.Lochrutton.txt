   Surface, Soil, and Climate.-From the town of Dumfries,
which is distant about four miles to the eastward, the country
rises gradually, more especially throughout the whole extent
of this district.  In the lower and upper extremities, and to-
wards the south, the country is hilly; but the rest of the pa-
rish lies in a valley consisting of arable land, interspersed with
knolls, mosses, and meadows.  The whole prospect forms a 
kind of amphitheatre.  The soil is various, but, in general, is
composed of light shallow loam, either on white granite, or on
a gravellith, and in many places a cold, springy bottom:  a spe-
cies of soil, which is neither very barren, nor very fertile.  The
climate is rather colder in this district, that in some of the
neighbouring parishes, being much elevated above the level of 
the sea, and having in it a large lake.  But as refreshing 
breezes are seldom wanting, even in the hottest weather; and
as, at other times, there are frequently sharp and high winds,
the air is greatly purified by these means; and, on the whole,
it is accounted healthy.

   Lake, Island, etc.-The lake or loch, from which the pa-
rish derives its name, is a mile in length, and, at an average,
about half a mile in breadth.  In the middle of it, there is a
small island, about half a rood in extent, of a circular form.
It seems to have been, at least in part, artificial:  Over its
whole surface, there is a collection of large stones which have
been founded on a frame of oak planks*.  There are both pike
and perch in the lake; and formerly eels were caught, in great
quantities, by means of wicker baskets, and sometimes of a
large chest placed in the sluice, at the foot of the lake, with o-

*The sea-gulls frequent this island in summer, and cover it all
over with their neils.
