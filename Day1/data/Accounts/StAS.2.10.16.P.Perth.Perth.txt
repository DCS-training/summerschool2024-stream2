             suppose that 7320 cubic inches of air contain two grains of mois-
             ture in the vaporous state : If the temperature were exactly 53/d1
             the air thus charged with humidity would be perfectly damp, or
             contain its maximum quantity of moisture at that temperature;
             but if the temperature of the same air were to be raised to 66/d1,
             in which case it could hold in solution four grains of moisture, or
             double of what it actually contained, the relative humidity would
             be expressed by 2/4 or 1/3; complete dampness being denoted by
             unity.  Moreover, if a hygrometer, whose indications were rigidly
             conformable to the humidity of the surrounding air, should be ex-
             posed to an atmosphere containing in solution the quantity of mois-
             ture we have supposed; and if the scale of the instrument were
             so graduated that zero was placed at perfect dryness and I OW at
             perfect dampness, the index would point exactly to 50/d1.  More-
             over, if the temperature of the same air were afterwards raised to
             75/d1, the index of the hygrometer would desicend to 25/d1, now im-
             plying that the moisture bontained in the aerial medium was only
             one-fourth of the whole quantity it was capable of holding in the
             vaporous state, at that elevated temperature. * It thus appears
             that the relative humidity of air, containing the very same quanti-
             ty nf moisture, might assume an unlimited variety of indications,
             as given by a hygrometer: Nay, however paradoxical it may seem,
             air may, in many cases, become absolutely drier, and yet be rela-
             tively damper.
               After the explanations which have been given of absolute and
             relative humidity, we need scarcely remark, that whatever be the
             quantity of moisture contained in a given volume of air, there will
             always be a tdmperature, more or less depressed below that ofthe
             atmosphere, which will be barely sufficient for maintaining that
             moisture in the state of vapour.  The smallest depression of tem-
             perature below that point, which is termed the point 0 Leon,
             and by some the dew-point will. give rise to a separation of mois-
             ture from the air, in the form of visible vapour, producing fog,
             rain, or snow  according to the extent and rapidity of the change
             of temperature; and according to the height in the atmosphere
             at which the change takes place.
                For ordinary purposes, the point of depositions may be deter-
             mined with sufficient accuracy in the following manner: Fill a
