of religion.  The seal since used, refers to the Roman origin
of the town.  It bears a golden eagle displayed, viz. an eagle
of the double or imperial kind; the two heads looking diffe-

double tressure, surmounts the breast of the eagle.  The le-
gend, at the bottom, Pro Rege, Lege, et Grege.  "For the
"King, the Law, and the People."
