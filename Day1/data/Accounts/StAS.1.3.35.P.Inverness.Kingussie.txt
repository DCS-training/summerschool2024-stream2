     of Kingussie and Inch.

   It is situated in Badenoch, a district in the shire of Inver-
ness; and is perhaps more elevated above the level of the
sea, and farther removed in every direction from the coast,
than any other parish in Scotland.

   Climate and Diseases.-As a consequence of the elevation of
the parish, the climate is naturally cold; and though from
this circumstance it might be regarded as healthy, yet there
are other causes, arising from the local situation, that render
some diseases exceedingly common; the low meadow grounds
have so little declivity, that every flood in the Spey over-
flows them, and the stagnation of the water not only renders
the land swampy, but produces noxious vapours.  Hence
rheumatisms, consumptions, and other complaints of a simi-
lar kind, are very frequent.

   Rivers and Lakes.-The river Spey intersects the parish,
running from west to east.  It winds in a number of beauti-
ful curves, through a rich fertile meadow, interspersed with
allar and willow trees; and the rising grounds to the south be-

appearing shaggy and abrupt to the north and west, with the
mountains in every direction, seen towering in distant pros-
pect; the whole, viewed in the calm of a summer's evening,
forms a scene truly romantic and picturesque.  The other
rivers within the parish are the Truim and Calder, the Tro-
mie, Gynag, and Peshie.  All these rivers abound with
trout; and some of them like pike, salmon, and charr.
There is a large lake called Loch Inch, about a mile square,
and situated at the eastern extremity of the parish.  It con-
tains plenty of all the kinds of fishes mentioned above.  Of
late an attempt was made to drain it, which, had it succeed-
ed, would have been a great advantage to the county; but,
