table right thereof."  This place was also called Kempisland.
Thus we find that, on 8th May 1610, John Birsbane of Bishopton,
was served heir of his father, Robert Birsbane, in the six shilling
eight penny land of old extent of Breedsorrow, alias Kempisland;
and in 1639, Sir Bryce Blair of Blair was served heir-male to his
father, Bryce Blair, in the same subject.  This change of proper-
ty proves that Pont's account must have been written between
these two dates, as is generally supposed.  Similar names occur in
different parts of Scotland, having the same apparent origin, where
there had been kemping, striving, contending, or fighting, such as
Kemp's fold, in Caputh parish, Kemp's Castle near Forfar.  See
Jam. Dict. voce Kemp.
   The Skelmorly aisle of the old church, with the monument
erected by Sir Robert Montgomery, and the painted adornments
of the ceiling, are still nearly in the same condition as they were in
1793.  It is an object which attracts and well merits the attention
of the curious in the progress of art in this country.  It is entitled
to careful preservation, being unquestionably the most magnificent
sepulchral design at present extant in the west of Scotland.

                       III.--POPULATION.
   The following table shows the progressive increase since 1755,
but the contrast with the population of the early part of the seven-
teenth century, as elsewhere noticed, is remarkable.

<TABLE>
	In 1755, the population was  1164
           1790,           -         1139
           1801,           -         1381
           1811,           -         1801
           1821,           -         2479
           1831,           -         2848
           1841,           -         3554

   The enumeration under the plan of the late census was 4054,
but of these 550 were strangers.  The population attached to the
district or quoad sacra parish of Fairlie, is 450, which is included
in the return for 1841, as above stated.
   From the inquiries made for the Church Commission, it appears
that the religious statistics may be thus classified:
