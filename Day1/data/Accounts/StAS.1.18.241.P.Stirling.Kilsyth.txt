of Kilsyth.

ordered it to be opened in the year 1670.  There are near-
ly 100 coal pits that have been wrought.
   In general, the dip of all the coals is to the south east.
But when it meets with what are called hitches, the dip alters
in every direction.  In one place at Balcastle, the coal was found
in the form of a trough, rising up in all directions.
   The manner in which they are wrought is by pick and
wedge; boys, and sometimes girls are employed to draw the
skissies, below ground.  The men enter about 4 in the
morning, and their day's work is generally over by 2 in the
afternoon.
   Each load may be about 2420 cubic inches.  It is sold at
7 d 1/2 at the hill.  Four of these make a tolerable cart; it is said,
they will weigh upwards of 1200 weight.
   There are generally from 8 to 12 constantly employed as
colliers; each of these at an average, will put out 10 or 12
loads per day: though some can put out more.  For each
load they have 3 pence, so that in general, they can earn
from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. a day.  There may be about 120 loads,
that is 30 carts put out daily, or about 180 carts every week.
Allowing 50 weeks in the year, there will be 9000 carts,
or 36,000 loads, annually put out.  This is equal to 10,300,000
hundred weight, or 871,200,000 cubic inches.  At half a
crown the cart, the sale in a year may be equal to L 1125
sterling.  But the expences attending the work are very
considerable; sometimes 9 or 10 men are constantly em-
ployed, besides colliers: so that the weekly expences are ge-
nerally from L. 9 to L. 16.
   It is to be hoped, that a great deal of this will be saved.
For there is a small steam engine immediately to be set up.
This will easily do the work of a number of men, and save an
enormous expence.
