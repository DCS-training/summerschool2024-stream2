   Language and Names of Places.-The language spoken in
this country is a dialect of the English; nor does there seem
to be any very peculiar provincial accent.  The names of 
places are chiefly derived from, the Gaelic, such as Pitsour,
Pitcogue, Cairney; Pitfour signifying, as the incumbent is
informed), a hollow beside a fortification; Pitcogue, a narrow 
hollow or gulley; Cairny, derived from cairn, which signifies
a heap of stones piled together for some religious purpose,
or for commemorating some remarkable event.  There is a
large stone, which gives name to a village or hamlet in the 
parish, called Hawkestone.  The tradition of the country is,
that it is the stone on which the hawk of the peasant Hay
alighted, after it had performed its flight round the land
given to the gallant rustic, in reward for his services perform-

soribed in modern letters; but for what reason it does not
appear.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The principal advantage
this parish possesses, in point of situation, is its vicinity to the
river Tay, which is navigable as far up as Perth.  The vil-
lage of Inchyra, situated on the river, is not much more than
a mile distant from any part of the parish, and not a guarter
of a mile from some parts of it.  And as this village has a
tolerable good harbour, that admits vessels of considerable
burden, it affords an easy and conveniet opportunity to the
inhabitants, of supplying themselves with coals and lime, and
at the same time of carrying off the produce of their indus-
try to the best markets.  The principal disadvantage, is the
badness of the roads in winter, owing to the nature of the
soil.  This, however, in time may be remedied.  An excel-
lent turnpike road has lately been made between Perth and 
Dundee, part of which passes through this parish, one of the
