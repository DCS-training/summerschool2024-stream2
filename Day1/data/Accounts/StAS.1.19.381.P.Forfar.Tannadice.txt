     of Tannadice.

Inshavan, Achlouchrie.  Inshavan is said to signify the island
surrounded with water.  Besides the evident tautology of
such a designation, there is no reason to suppose that it was
ever descriptive of the situation of the place.  The mean-
ing given to Achlouchrie, which, it is said, means the cow-
haugh, is more natural, as it corresponds to the local situa-
tion; for a considerable part of the grounds, which receive
this name, lies low on the border of Esk.  Barn-yards,
Fusting-haugh, Whitewall, etc. are evidently Gothic, Murt-
hall seems to acknowledge the same origin.
   The real rent of the parish is between L. 3000 and
L. 4000 Sterling.  There are thirteen heritors, three of
whom only are resident.  The valued rent is divided in
the following proportions, in Scotch money:
