found two gold rings or clasps, weighing 29 soverehgns, which were
sold to a jeweller in Glasgow, but afterwards re-purchased by Lord
Douglas, in whose possession they remain. The gold is very
pure, but the workrmanship is not very refined. If any respectable
antiquary feels desirous of gratifying his curiosity, and of deter-
mining the use to which they were intended to be applied, he needs
not fear a refusal from his Lordship to be permitted to see them.
	Modern Buildings.--There are no modern buildings in the parish
which demand particular notice. The plan of the mansion-house of
Carmichael was formed on a very magnificent scale, but only the two
wings, connected by a long gallery or corridor, were finished. They
contain a great deal of accommodation. The mansion-house of
Eastend is a more modern building, and very commodious. The
farm-houses which have been recently built are very neat, and con-
tain much more comfortable accommodation than those which were
occupied forty or fifty years ago. There are two very good grain
mills in the parish, and the only astriction imposed on the tenants
is an obligation to carry their grain to one of the mills of the
prietor, whether in the parish or not.
