disposed to government.  They are generally sober and
industrions in their way, and their manners becoming and
respectful.  In justice to the female part of them it must
be said, that in industry and sobriety they excel, with scarce
an exception remembered.  Where a farmer has not thri-
ven, the blame has ever been on his side of the house.  No
capital offence, and few mildemeanors, are remembered to
have happened within the parish.  A number of the people
of this parish, however, entered into the Secession from the
Established Church so early as the year 1736, and they
were partly the support of the meeting house then erected
at Lockerbie.  Several of them still attend there; but they
are by no means rigid against the Established Church.  If
they are disappointed of their own pastor, most of them
do not scruple to hear the nearest Established minister.

   Climate, etc.-The parish is in general reckoned healthy,
yet there are not many old persons in it at present, and no
account of any extraordinary instances of longevity.  In
1792, one died aged 92.  There are now only 4 men be-
tween 80 and 85; 11 between 70 and 80; and 21 between
60 and 70.  The complaints most general are severs and
consumptions.  A malignant sever carried off about 12
young people about 15 years ago; but there is no other
instance remembered of the same kind.  Inoculation is
practised, but not commonly.  The natural small pox
have not of late been mortal, nor are they remembered to
have been much so formerly.

   Antiquities.-There are not many antiquities attended to.
There are several remains of old enclosures, of a circular
form, called British sorts, and a square one at Cartertown,
of the Roman kind; but there is no record nor tradition of
those who founded or used them.  Two of them seem to
