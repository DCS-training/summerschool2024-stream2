<FOOTNOTE>

*The reason, why there is so much greater proportion of weavers in the
parish, than of any other trade, is, the weaving manufactures, which are carried
on, in the neighbouring towns of Kirkcaldy and Link-town of Abbotshall.  It is
from these, that the greatest part of our weavers receive their employment; and
it is this, which draws in so many of them to settle in the village.  A great
part of the women too, who reside in the village, are employed in spinning
lint to the same manufacturies.  They spin on the two-handed wheal, and are
able to earst from 6 d. to 8 d. per day, according to their particular alertness and
dexterity.
