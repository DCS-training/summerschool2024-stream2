     Statistical Account

various disputes had arisen respecting their several rights
and privileges.  These were fixed, on a reference between 
the different parties in 1604, by a decreet-arbitral, known
by the name of the Letter of Guildry, which was con-
firmed by the Town-council that same year, and after-
wards by an act of Parliament in 1672, by which the
rights of the burgesses, the regulations of the Dean of Guild
court, the election of the Dean of Guild and the Convener,
and the constitution of the Merchants and Trades Houses,
were fixed and settled.
   The Town-court, for the decision of all civil causes, is
held every Friday by the Bailies; who have also a court on
Monday, for deciding all causes under 20 s. by a summary
process; and, besides these stated weekly courts, the Magi-
strates daily decide in causes, which require summary dis-
cussion, without waiting the ordinary forms of court.  They
also exercise criminal jurisdiction, in crimes whose pu-
nishment does not infer death or demembration, or far-
ther banishment than beyond the liberties of the burgh.
   The Dean of Guil, with the assistance of 4 persons cho-
sen by the merchants and 4 by the trades, holds a court
every Thursday, for determining in all matters relative to
buildings, and differences arising from neighbourhood of
property within the city, and also for regulating and over-
seeing the weights and measures.  The Sheriff of Lanark,
or his substitute, holds a court here every Wednesday.
The Commissariot Courts of Glasgow, and of Hamilton and
Campsie, are held on Thursday, and the Lords of Justiciary
hold the assizes here in spring and autumn.
   The revenue of the city, in the management of the Town-
council, is about L. 7000 per annum, and arises from the
rents of land and houses belonging to the community; from
the rents of the church seats; from an impost of two pennies
Scotch on every Scotch pint of ale, brewed or sold within
