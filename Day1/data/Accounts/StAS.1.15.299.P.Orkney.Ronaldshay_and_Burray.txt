say by a branch of the Pentland Firth, through which ships of
any burden may pass.  Swinna is a barren inhospitable island,
exposed on all sides to the utmost rage of the Pentland Firth.
What probably induced any person at first to dwell in it, was
the hope of high wages from pilotage.  Though, at new
and full moon, the tide runs against this island at the rate
of nine miles an hour, yet there are few instances of wrecks
on it:  For the resistance which the rocks give to the violence
of the large current, produces a small current running along
its shore to each end of the island: Thus, it gives to many
a trembling mariner a most agreeable disappointment.  When
the strong large tide carries him so near, that he every mo-
ment expects his bowsprit to strike against the rocks, and his
vessel to fall to pieces under him, he is delightfully surprised
to feel a current coming from Swinna, which turns him a-
bout in a moment, and safely conducts him round its terri-
fying rocks.
   Burray is an island about 4 miles long and one mile broad,
bounded by Water Sound on the South; Holm Sound, 3 miles
broad, which separates it from the parish of Holm, on the
North; and the German Ocean on the East; These parishes
are a part of the presbytery of Kirkwall, and synod of Ork-
ney.  Besides the three inhabited islands above mentioned,
there are, within the bounds of these parishes, three uninha-
bited green islands called Glemsholm, Horda, near Burray,
and Pentland Skerry, about 6 miles South from South Ron-
aldsay, near the middle of the East end of the Pentland
Firth.  On these isles, each of which is about a mile long,
and half a mile broad, sheep and cattle are fed.  There is a
light-house to be erected this year on the Pentland Skerry,
which will unquestionably be attended with manifold advan-
tages to the shipping, coming to the Pentland Firth, through
