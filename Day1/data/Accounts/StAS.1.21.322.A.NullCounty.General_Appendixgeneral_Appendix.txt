racy, and to understand what they read.  Those words which
seldom or never occur in their circle of conversation, ought
to be well explained, and an account of these explanations
frequently repeated.  Spelling and writing should also obtain
their due share of attention.  Let the principles of arithme-

whom many opportunities must occur of explaining numerous
circumstances, which could not properly find a place in the

   One gentleman, well known as a literary character, has
lately favoured the world with a few little volumes admirably
calculated for the instruction and amusement of youth.  They
