     Statistical Account

principal object of the farmer is to produce butter, and but-
ter milk, for the Glasgow market.  The butter that is made
here, and especially that which is salted for winter's use, is
reckoned preferable to any other, and the demand for it is
vastly greater than can be answered.  It has nothing of that
rancid taste, which butter made on deeper and heavier soils
is sometimes found to have; and it keeps in good condition
for a very long time.  Potatoes are raised for domestic use,
and some barley and oats, but scarcely so much of the latter
as can supply the parish.  It is but a few years since sown
grasses were introduced.  Less attention, perhaps, than they
deserve, have been paid to these, on account of the great
crops of natural grass which the soil, in many places, is fitted
to produce Two hundred stone of this grass is often raised
upon one acre; in some particular spots, 260, or even 280,
and this, too, for a great succession of years.  This natural
grass sells one penny, or three-halfpence per stone cheaper
than the best clover and rye-grass.  Field turnips have hi-
therto been sown only in small quantities.

   Cows.-Most of the cows here are of a middle size, and
of a brown and white colour.  They give from 10 to 15
Scotch pints of milk per day.  Some of them, during the
prime of the grass, give 17 or 18 pints.  There are not
a few farmers, however, whose cows, upon, an average,
do not give above 8 Scotch pints per day.  This is owing to
their want of care to get a proper breed, and to their keep-
ing more of them upon their ground than it is able suffi-
ciently to pasture.  Their queys, too, are much injured, by
being kept in the Moor of Mearns, where they are only
half fed; and from this circumstance, they never afterwards
attain the size, nor give the quantity of milk, which those
cows do that have been reared with care at home.
