water four feet deep; the boats carry for the shipping, or the
salt-pans, from twelve to fifteen tons; the land carriage 600
yards from the west end of the canal to the harbour of Salt-
coats.

   In the year 1778, these gentlemen made a new and success-
ful trial, where nothing had ever been attempted before, in a
field called the Misk, on the banks of the Gagnock, at the
eastern extremity of Mr Warner's estate and of the parish.
There they erected a fire-engine on a pit forty fathoms deeps
and wrought the first and fourth seams, (see figure.)  They
continued in the mean time to work on their western colliery till
they were stopped by an unconquerable depth of sand.  This
obstacle they endeavoured to surmount by a very ingenious
effort.  They attempted to drive a very small canal under
ground, from the bottom of the pit along the level and pave-
ment of the coal, and actually carried this canal more than
200 yards eastward; purposing, had things answered, to
have driven it on, the whole way to the Misk; to have con-
nected their two colleries by means of this subterraneous
communication, and thus to have saved themselves the enor-
mous expence of sinking pits from the surface along this
track.  But unfortunately their coal at that place began to
degenerate, and turn into humph; so that they were forced
to abandon this project, and execute another more obvious
and practicable for the exportation of the Misk coal.  This
was, to cut two short canals above ground, from the Garnock
to the mouth of their two pits, with flood-gates facing the
river; and to build lighters of thirty tons burden.  Into
there the baskets full of coals are emptied, or poured, as they
come up from the mouth of the pits at a very small charge;
and, failing down the canals and the river, the lighters dif-
charge their coals either into empty vessels lying at anchor in
