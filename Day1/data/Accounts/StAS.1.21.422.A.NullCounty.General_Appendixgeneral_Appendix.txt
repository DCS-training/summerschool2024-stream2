General Appendix to

number of carriages to be paid as part of the rent, it does not
appear to be considerable.  I have been certainly informed,
that there was a time, when the whole carriages on the
estate of Airly were offered to be commuted at a moderate
conversion, but to this the tenants would not agree.  A-
mong the few leases granted to tenants in the parish, some
are very low rented, and without any carriages.  But those
who have no regular leases have been in use to possess on
agreement for a period of between fourteen and nineteen
years; and as these agreements are never broke through,
the tenants consider themselves as in perfect security, and
they live satisfied and happy.  May this amity long con-
tinue.  On this head, I think it rather the business of a
clergyman to preach the gospel of peace to his hearers, than
to make any attempts to raise discord between his parishion-
ers and their master where none prevailed before.  But, if
the mode of letting farms that has, for some time, been
adopted in this parish, should be considered as in any de-
gree discouraging, I am certainly informed, that leases are
to be granted to such tenants as have no title of possession,
and who may chuse to have them.  It is undoubtedly no
small mark of encouragement and satisfaction, as well as of
industry, that some of the greater farmers have inclosed
very considerable parcels of ground; and within these few
years, have cultivated from waste land covered with heath
and whins, forty, sixty or more acres, which they have dis-
covered to be by no means of inferior quality, and which
have produced very good crops of corn and barley.
   With regard to the amount of live stock and their value,
I am informed, there are about 200 horses, worth, at an
average, from eight to twelve pounds sterling, nine hundred
cattle, worth at an average, when about three years old,
from five to seven pounds sterling; and near to 200 sheep,
