tors.  The price of the acre of arable land, when feued, is
generally from 8 L. to 12 L. Sterling, without reckoning any
thing for grass or common pasturage.

   Cultivation and Produce.-The union of farms is frequent.
One man now occupies as much land, as was, 40 years ago,
possessed by 5 or 6 families.  The principal crops consist of
oats, barley and rye.  The last has, of late years, been in no
high estimation, from the effect it has scourging the ground.
Wheat is sown here occasionally in small quantities.  Tur-
nips and potatoes succeed to a wish.  Potatoes, in a short
time, will constitute the one half of the people's food.  Sown
grass is every where to be met with, and very luxuriant crops
arise from it.  The lime quarries are opened by the pro-
prietor.  The country abounds with them.  The boll of lime,
which measures 24 Scotch pints each firlot, is fold at 8 d. per
boll.  It is necessary to make this distinction, as the Banff-
shire boll is less by a third.  A lint mill is erected by the
proprietor, and most people low flax with success.  A bleach-
field is just established, which bids fair to be of great advan-
tage to the country.

   Population.-There is not a single sectary of any denomi-
nation in the parish; the whole people being of the estab-
lished church.  The number of souls belonging to the parish,
may be stated at 3000. but many of them go occasionally
south, during the summer season, to work at roads, and other
public works, which renders the amount fluctuating.  The
return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, was 3063 souls.  The births,
at an average, for the years 1735, 1736 and 1737, were 80
each year:  for the 3 last years, they did not exceed 60.
-The marriages are from 10 to 12 in the year.  The
