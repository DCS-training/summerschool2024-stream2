   To lay down rules calculated on liberal principles, for
the conduct which is becoming the character and descrip-
tion of the worthy farmer, that when he proceeds merito-
riously, he may be protected; when he approves himself a
useful member, he may be rewarded; and when he is the
object of undeserved persecution, that he may be supported.
Such are the laudable and professed designs of this Society.
It is composed of the nobleman, and many of the respect-
able gentlemen, and of the principal farmers, of this county.
   The president of the society is an honorary member of
the national "Board of Agriculture."
   The funds of the society arise from admission fees, and
a small annual stipulated exaction from each member.  They
have three stated annual meetings, generally held in the
Mason Hall of Banff.

   Friendly Societies.-Besides St Andrews Lodge of Free
Masons, and the Operative Mason Lodge, there are several
friendly societies established in Banff.
   I. Solomon's Lodge, or the Gardener Friendly Society,
was instituted in April 1778.  It consists of 500 members.
Their funds are in a flourishing state.  They are possessed
of houses and lands in the town and vicinity, which yield a
yearly rent of L. 80 Sterling.  To the widows of de-
cayed brethren, last year, they paid upwards of L. 60 Ster-
ling.
   II. The Grey-stone Friendly Society, was established in
the year 1792.  The benefit of this institution is not con-
fined to any particular description of persons or professions.
Their funds, it is believed, are in a progressive state of im-
provement.
   These, and some other societies belonging to particular
corporations, prove of substantial advantage in this place,
