base of these hills, and which forms the higher and more southern
portion of the parish, almost completely hides the junction of the
transition with the more level country; nor do I know of any one
point at which the subjacent rock has been laid open. The secon-
dary rocks, which constitute the chief material of the district, are
first exposed, on a great scale, in the course of the stream which
passes through Currie wood.
 I have not observed that the alluvial deposits, either of an older
or more recent date, are more numerous or of greater depth in the
neighbourhood of the bills than near the present level of the sea,
although the contrary seems to be an opinion generally entertain-
ed by geologists, and which, it may be, is verified by appearances
in other places. In a quarry which was lately opened near
the upper part of Currie wood, the alluvial deposit which covers
the rocks of the quarry, contains many exquisitely formed discs of
a very friable sandstone, of a rich purple or violet or red colour.
They are so perfectly formed, that the nicest operation of the
chisel could present nothing more complete. They easily, fall to
pieces when attempted to be broken, and stain the hand of a rich
colour, according to the peculiar tint of the specimen. The allu-
vial matter itself, where it is not absolutely formed into such discs,
sbews in many places, and on a greater scale, the same tendency
to the disc form,-and the whole phenomena indicate a very peculiar
and not yet understood action of the attractive and arranging forces
at the time when the waters were retiring, and the alluvial deposit
was, in the process of arranging itself.
  On the summit of Cowbrae hill, which is at the upper boundary
of the parish, and from which there is one of the richest and most
extensive views in this part of the country, an immense mass of,
rock of the same material as the neighbouring hills, (the grey-
wacke), is found lying at almost the very highest point of the hill,
It is quite detached from the rocks constituting the hill itself, and
the inquiry which naturally offers itself to all visitors is, whether it
has been laid there by human art, or been transported by the agency
of water, at a very early epoch of the history of our globe. There
can be no doubt in the minds of those who are accustomed to surge
speculations and who have seen many such appearances, that the
latter of these two causes was the one which actually operated in
this instance; but the curious circumstance still remains of the
deposit being at precisely such a point as human art would have
chosen, had it sought to rear a magnificent altar, from which the
