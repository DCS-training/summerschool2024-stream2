     of Premnay.

   Proprietors, etc.-Of these there are four, but none of
them at present reside in the parish.  The rent of the pa-
rish amounts nearly to L. 1000.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Mr James Douglas is the present
minister.  His stipend, by a late decreet, is worth L. 100
Sterling.  Colonel Hay of Rannes is patron.  The church
was lately rebuilt, and the manse repaired and enlarged.

   Character of the People, and Miscellaneous Observations.
-They are in general sober, honest, and industrious.
Where an estate is newly peopled, the farmers cannot be
supposed to be so much attached to the soil, or to the pro-
prietor, as where they have resided on the lands from their
infancy.  And it sometimes happens, that a stranger will
take an improved farm, with a design to scourge it.  This
cannot be justified by the laws of morality.  On the other
hand, an indulgent landlord is respected by his old tenants;
and whenever the rents of an estate are raised beyond a
certain sum, the proprietor seldom gains so much in point
of real interest, as he loses in point of respectability of cha-
racter.  In the district of Garioch, nominal rents have pro-
duced bad payments and dispirited farmers.  A little far-
ther advancement in the knowlege of farming, and a little
more indulgence from the proprietor, will, it is hoped, soon
produce in a country naturally fertile, rents that are regu-
larly paid, and farmers who are enterprising and inde-
pendent.
