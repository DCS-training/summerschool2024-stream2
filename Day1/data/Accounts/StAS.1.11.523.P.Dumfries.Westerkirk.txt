their relief is 57 L. 6 s. 4 d. Of the above assessment, the ses-
sion advances 7 L. 5 s. 5 d.; the rest is paid, one half by the
heritors, and the other by the tenants.  There is a sum of
160 L. in stock, the interest of which, at 4 per cent, together
together with the collections, the use of the morthcloth, and what fines
or penalties are exacted from defaulters, enable the session,
not only to advance more than an 8th part of the whole an-
nual assessment, but to provide clothing for several of the pau-
pers, and to relieve such individuals as fall into circumstan-
ces of distress between the quarterly meetings.  The number
of poor upon the roll had increased no more than 2 for 10
years preceding Candlemas last, whereas the assessment was
nearly doubled.

The number of poor upon the roll in February 1783, was 17
             Ditto,              in February 1793,     19
The quarterly assessment, in Feb. 1783, was L. 7 1 s 9 1/2
         Ditto,           in Feb. 1793,        14  6   7

   This rapid increase of poor's rates may indeed be somewhat
alarming to those by whom the assessment is paid.  Trusting
to thsese rates, individuals are not so folicitous, perhaps, as
they otherwise would be, to make provision for a time of
sickness, a season of dearth, or the indigence of old age; and
this mode of providing for the poor may serve to lessen that
attention to parents, and that desire to provide for their com-
fortable subsistence, which are so much the duty of, and so
very becoming in children:  On the other hand, since this
method of maintaining the paupers commenced, the parish has
not been much infested with vagrants and sturdy beggars;
and the poor being thus provided for, live comfortably at
home, and are not reduced to the necessity of wandering up
and down the country begging bread.
