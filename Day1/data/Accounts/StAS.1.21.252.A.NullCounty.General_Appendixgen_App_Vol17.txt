Fingleton in Lanarkshire, where they had a large estate,
The first charter of it is in the 13th century.  Part of that
estate was sold, by Sir William Hamilton of Preston, so late
as 1704, to Dr. Oswald, son to a provost of Edinburgh,
along with the barony of Preston.
   It is probable the whole of that barony was church or ab-
bey lands, and sell under grants made, on the Reformation,
to the ancestors of the noble family of Ker, as lords of erec-
tion.  But the old writings of the barony and others perished
by the fire which consumed the tower in 1663.
   To the Hamiltons of Preston, Sir Thomas Nicolson, king's
advocate, the celebrated Bishop Burnet, and Sir Thomas
Craig, the great feudal lawyer, were nearly related, as ap-
pears from the well-known and valuable works of Craig and
Burnet.
   Sir Thomas Nicolson left no sons, but several daughters,
who married into the best families.  The Marquis of Lo-
thian, the Earl of Kinnoul, Scot of Maleny, Carse of Cock-
pen, Hamilton of Preston and Olivestob, Mr Erskine of
Mar, etc. are descended of Sir Thomas Nicolson.
   The estate of Prestongrange, part of the barony of Preston,
was acquired early in the 17th century by Mr George Mori-
son, whose father had the lands of Troup in Banffshire, and
of Pitsour in Aberdeenshire, as his descendants have had the
estate of Boguie in Banffshire, which anciently was called
Frendraught, and belonged to Chancellor Crichton as far
back as James II.'s reign.
   One of Prestongrange's daughters, Katherine, was married
to Lord Strathnaver, and she was mother of Lady Janet Sin-
clair;-grandmother of the last Earl of Sutherland, and of
Sir John Sinclair; another, Jean, was Viscountess of Ar-
buthnot; and a third, Helen, was Countess of Glasgow, and
grandmother of the present Earl of Glasgow.
