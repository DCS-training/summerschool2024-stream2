frost of snow.  In the year 1775, when the whole island of 
Great Britain was almost buried in snow, this parish present-
ed the eye with its favourite colour; and green fields and 
happy flocks were pleasing objects to the traveller and enriched
their owners.  The soil is not deep, but exceeding fine, yield-
ing an increase equal to Hertfordshire.

   To the care and superior skill of the present Earl of Gal-
loway, the fertility and beauty of this parish are in great
measure to be ascribed.  His Lordship lives in it several
months every year, and has shewn much attention to agricul-
ture, breeding of cattle, and planting.  When he came to the

are all inclosed, and well cultivated.  The roads are of the
proper breadth, well formed, and made of good materials;
and plantations every where present themselves.

   Galloway House was built by the late Earl, and forms part

on the north; and Rigg, or Hunter's Bay, is on the south of 
it.  From its windows are seen the richest fields; an indent-

isles, and the losty mountains of Cumberland and Man, appear-

volumes.

   Lord Galloway's management of his estate deserves parti-
cular notice.  The lands about Galloway House are well 
divided, and the fields are completely sheltered by the plan-
tations, which produces many advantages.  The grass springs
