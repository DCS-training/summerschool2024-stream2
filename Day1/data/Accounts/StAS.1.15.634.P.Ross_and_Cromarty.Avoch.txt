a populous parish as this, and where the linen manufacture
stands much in need of improvement.

   State of the Poor, etc.-There are about 40 indigent per-
sons now on the roll.  The funds for their relief are the in-
terest of 33 L. 6 s. 8 d. Sterling, bequeathed by the late Sir
Kenneth M'Kenzie of Scatwell in the hands of his own fa-
mily;-the interest of about 50 L. more under the session's
management; and the public voluntary contributions in
church: which last, at an average of three years bygone, a-
mounts to 8 L. 11 s. 4 d. Sterling yearly.  All these funds, how-
ever, can afford but a scanty help to each.
   A crew of the fishermen having been accidentally drown-

girl, in particular, who, at 19 years of age, had been married
only seven months before, was, by this unforseen accident,
bereaved at once of her husband! her father! her brother!
and was left big with child, and in debt!  On this melan-
choly occasion, it was found necessary to ask some charitable
assistance from other places.  And a liberal supply was ob-
tained, adequate to their more immediate needs.  For, be-
sides what was collected within the bounds of this presbytery,
the following contributions from different quarters, mostly
unsolicited, were remitted to the kirk session for relief of
those unfortunate people, and have all been distributed among
them, viz.
