former times groaned, and the satisfaction of having their rents
punctually paid, will all contribute to mutual comfort and ad-
vantage, and finally, will diffuse a spirit of industry, inspire
gratiude,-and give to the lower class a sort of independance
natural to the creatures of God, and to free born citizens.

   Roads.-During the summer, the roads are in good repair.
But as the soil of which they are made, is in general of deep
spouting clay, they become very bad in winter, and the num-
ber of carriages of all kinds which pass along, break them
much before they attain to a proper degree of firmness.-The
post road leading from south to north, was originally formed
by military, and is now kept in repair by means of the statute
labour, exacted in kind, i.e. 3 days work of each man in sum-
mer, from the age of 15 to 60 years, and 3 in autumn, but
when they perform five days in summer, it is accepted in full.
-The Justices of the peace within this district who take the
trouble of directing the business, appoint a proper overseer to
attend the labourers, who are called out to the work by an ad-
vertisement read the preceding sabbath at the different church-
es, by the precentor, immediately after divine service is con-
cluded; and the person thus appointed, is authorised to ac-
cept of 3 d per day, as a composition from those who do not
attend.-The money thus collected from absents, is applied to
the payment of men, hired at 9 d per day, etc. to work upon
the roads.-By men thus employed, more work is peformed,
and to much better purpose than by the people who ought to do
it, who in general, are not sensible of the great advantage of
good roads, go to the labour with reluctance and perform it in
an aukward and slovenly manner.-There are no turnpikes;
although it is thought they would be of advantage, yet it is
doubtful if this part of the country could bear the expence.
