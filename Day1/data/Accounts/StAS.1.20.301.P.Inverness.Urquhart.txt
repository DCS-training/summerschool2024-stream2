ance against his enemies; but he was discomfited, pursued
up the valley, and was killed at the head of it, and there
buried.
   In Argyleshire, a tradition is preserved respecting a Nor-
wegian prince of the name of Moni, who cam with a con-
siderable number of ships, to that part of the western coast
wgere the Crinan Canal is now carrying on.  His follow-
eres having disembardked, they penetrated the country, and
after having possessed themselves of all the plunder they
could collect, in returning to their ships, they were attack-

his followers were routed, and many of them killed, and
himself, with a few of his followers, were pressed so hard,
that they could not regain their ships, but sted northwards,
towards Lochaber.  The tract of country through which he
was pursued, in endeavouring to reach his ships, is precisely
in the line of the Crinan Canal, and is known at this day
by the appellation of the pass of Moni.
   According to the tradition of the peole in Urquhart,
Moni was a Norweigian or Danish prince, for he is always
called Moni Mor, mac Ri Lochlinn; that is, the Great Mo-
ni, the son of the King of Lochlin.

   Burying Places.-There are in Glenmoriston two bury

of the lower part of the valley, where the river Moriston
discharges itself into Lochness; and Clachan Merecheard,
which is called after a Saint of the name of Merechard.
The name of Clachan, given to burial places, is derived
from the word clach, whic signifies a stone.  Anciently,
in Druidical times, places of worship, and also burial pla-
ces, were rendered remarkable by a great collection of
stones, some thrown together in the shape of cairn, others,
of a great size, standing on end, in a circular form; and
