     Statistical Account

N. E. by a steep descent, at least 100 feet above the level
of the water, which runs within 40 yards of the foot of 
this descent.  On the S. E. S. and S. W. there are two
ditches, formerly of considerable depth.  The inner ditch
is within 40 yards of the present house; the outer one,
which is about 250 yards beyond the former, is from 500
to 600 yards in length.  When this fortress was built, or
by whom, I find not.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people, in general, are
sober and industrious, humane, generous and hospitable,
and seemingly contented with thier situation; but I'am
persuaded, the number of distilleries in this and the neigh-
bouring parishes, have been rather prejudicial to the health,
morals and industry of some inhabitants.  Here, it
is common for five or six, and sometimes more poor peo-
ple, to have different shares in one distillery; and while
their profits by this manufacture are very small, this
practice has introduced a habit of drinking in these distille-
ries, and has rendered such of the people as are engaged in
this business, indolent and inactive, naver inclining to ap-
ply vigorously to any other business.  There are also no 
less than 8 dram-houses in the parish, where spirits are sold
at a low price, which must also be unfriendly to the morals
of the inhabitants; half the said number would be fully
sufficient to accommodate travellers.-There are several
mosses of considerable extent in the parish; those who live
close to these mosses are well suplied in peats, but many
of the inhabitants are at the distance of 3 or 4 miles from
these mosses; the access to them is also very bad.  Thus,
a great part of the summer is employed in cutting, drying
and carrying home fuel, to the great disadvantage of the far-
mer.-The size of the people is from 5 feet 5 inches to 6
