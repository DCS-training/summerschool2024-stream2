though the demand for cotton goods, has much diminished
the consumption of these articles.  There is also a consider-
able manufactory of carpets and coarse woollens, for which
no place seems to be better adapted, being in the neigh-
bourhood of a country where great quantities of sheep
are raised.  As the gentleman in Scotland seem now to

having been erected in 1748; since which it has been al-
tered into the manufacture of stone or Queen's ware, in
which very considerable improvements have been made of
late, both in the quality, shapes, and colour of the ware; so
