tor.  If ever it presented any striking displays of the taste,
and magnificence of our forefathers, they have been remov-
ed; and, should the practice of demolishing its ruins conti-
nue a few years longer, the eye of the most prying antiquary,
will scarcely be able to discern the situation where it was
placed.

   Besides the ruins of the abbey of Lindores, this parish con-
tains two crosses of very ancient erection.  One of these is
placed on a rising ground, a little westward of the town of
Newburgh, and within 4 yards of the Tay.  The other is si-
tuated at the distance of somewhat less than a mile to the S.

large quadrilateral block of freestone, rudely indented in se-
veral places, but is laid to have had formerly another stone
standing upright; although the stone now lying along the
the ground, has no appearance of ever having been hollowed,
in the manner of that which forms the base of the Cross of
Mugdrum.  No satisfactory account can be given of the va-

serve.  The tradition, which conners Cross M'Duff with the
jurisdiction of the powerful Thane of Fife, may not be desti-
tute of foundation; but in regard to the Cross of Mugdrum,
even tradition ceases to furnish any information.  It were
needless to quote the lines of jargon, which are said to have
