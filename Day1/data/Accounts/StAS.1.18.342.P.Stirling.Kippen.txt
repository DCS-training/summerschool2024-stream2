Deshoar, and his successors, are authorized to keep 3 free
fairs in the year, at certain times which are specified, each
to continue 3 days; and also a weekly market every Wednes-
day, to be holden on the Castle-hill of Dasher, on which part
of the village of Kippen now stands.  Two of these fairs
still remain.  That which was appointed to be held in the
month of September, has been long disused, as also the
weekly market; if indeed it was ever observed at all.  The
weekly markets in December are probably all that remains
of it.

   Prices of Labour, etc.-It must be of use to record the
price of labour, and of the provisions and various commodi-
ties which are produced and consumed in a country, as no
circumstance tends more to ascertain its relative situation
with respect to other countries, and to itself, both in former
and subsequent times.-About 40 years ago the wages of
men-servants were about L. 2, of women from 15 s to 16 s 8 d
a-year, with bounties.  Those who were careful saved most
of their wages, as the bounties were sufficient to furnish them
with cloaths.  About 30 years ago, wages had gradually ad-
vanced, men's to L. 5 or L. 6, women's to L. 1:15 or L. 2:5.
Bounties are now generally abolished, and in 1793, from
L. 7 to L. 9, were given to men, from L. 2:10 to L. 3:10,
to women.-In harvest, as there is no weekly market, reap-
ers are generally hired by the season.  Before 1760 men re-
ceived from 13 s 4 d to 16 s 8 d, women from 10 s to 13 s 4 d;
and in 1793 men received 30 s, women 20 s.-Before 1760,
the wages of taylors and day-labourers, was 4d a-day, with
victuals; 6 d was given in 1783, and 10 d in 1793.  Carpen-
ters and masons about 30 years ago, got 6 d a-day, with vic-
tuals; in 1793, they received 1 s 2 d.  Formerly, smiths were
paid by the farmers with grain, for serving them in work
