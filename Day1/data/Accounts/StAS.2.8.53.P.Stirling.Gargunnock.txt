ing to the Grahams who were Barons of Boquhan. The ruins of
this ancient tower were dug up, about eighty years ago, in the field
of Old Hall; and at that time, some aged men remembered the
old iron door and grated windows. The glen of Boquhan is so
grand and romantic, with wild and beautiful scenery, that it is,
sometimes called Trosachs. About a mile above the glen, the
burn which descends from Ballochleam has washed out, in the soft
freestone rocks, some very curious shapes, resembling wells and
caldrons.
   Mansion-houses.--Mr Moir of Leckie has latelv built a very
elegant, commodious, and beautiful house, after the plan of tho
ancient English baronial mansion-houses. It stands on a higher
situation than the old mansion-house of Leckie, and has a com-,
manding view of the picturesque and beautiful strath of Monteath.
And when the approach and pleasure grounds are finished, it will
be one of the finest gentleman's seats in the country. Colonel
Graham has built a very beautiful house at Meiklewood, near the
site of the old mansion-house, and it is a prominent object among
the fine old trees which surround it.

	                           1833,    90
   The decrease is partly owing to the	enlargement of farms, two
or three having been put into one; and partly owing to emigra-
tion to other parishes. The number of the population in the vil-
lage is 466; and in the country part of the parish it is 442.
