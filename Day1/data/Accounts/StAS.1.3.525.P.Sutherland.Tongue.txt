   Mode of conducting Burials.-Burials are conducted in this
parish with very great decorum.  None, even of the com-
mon people, attend without a particular invitation.  After
some entertainment, (for at the burial of the poorest here,

beath, or some foreign liquor, butter and cheese, with oat
bread), the friends of the deceased, and neighbours of the 
village, who come to witness the interment, are drawn up in
rank and file, by an old serjeant, or some veteran who has
been in the army, and who attends to maintain order, and
give, as they term it here, the word of relief:  Upon his
crying Relief! the 4 under the bier prepare to leave their'
stations, and make room for other 4, that instantly succeed.
This progression is observed, at the interval of every 5 mi-

distance requires it, there is a second, a third, or a fourth
round of such evolutions gone through.  When the persons
present are not inflamed with liquor, which is now seldom the
case, there is a profound silence generally observed, from the
time the corpse has been taken up, till the interment is over.

   Church and Heritor.-The church of Tongue was first

this parish.  He is the only heritor in it.  The value of the
living, including the glebe, is about 54 L.

of these was erected last year, by the Society for propagating
Christian Knowledge, with a salary of 12 L. per annum.  It

committee of the presbytery, whose report bears, that there
