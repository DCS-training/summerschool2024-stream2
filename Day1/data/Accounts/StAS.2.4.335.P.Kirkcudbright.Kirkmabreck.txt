   The population of this parish has increased slowly but gradu-
ally for many years. In Dr Webster's list in 1755 the numbers
were rated at 858. In the year 1764 the whole population amount-
ed to only 680; of which the Ferry-Town of Cree, (now Creetown,)
contained 104. The landward part of the parish har altered very
little in point of population since that period. The principal in-
crease has been in Creetown, and the following table will show the
increase at different times:--
