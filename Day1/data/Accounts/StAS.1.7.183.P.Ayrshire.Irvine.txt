   Climate and Diseases.-The climate here is much the same
as in other places on the west coast, more mild and tempe-
rate than in higher and more inland parts of the country;
the snow often lying on these when there is none here, and
the frost severer and of longer continuance.  The town, from
its situation, being at the distance of one mile from the sea,
and elevated above it, is reckoned very healthy.
   No epidemical distempers, but such as are common in
other places, prevail here.
   For these last 17 years, the fever has appeared twice only.
The first of these times it was neither of so bad a kind, nor
so mortal, as in other places in the neighbourhood.  In 1790
and 1791, it was general, and of long continuance, thought
not above 24 died of it.  The influenza, as it was called,
which raged in this country some years ago, was general here
also, but of short continuance, and none of the inhabitants
died of it.  In the year 1760, many of the inhabitants of
this place died of the bloody flux.  The infection, it is said,
was brought from Ireland.  The most remarkable instances
of longevity in this parish are, a man of the name of Grant,
who died in the 105th year of his age; four of the same fa-
mily, whose ages were as under; the father 92, his son 86,
his grandson 83, his great-grandson 80.  A woman died last
year aged 103.  Some are living, and in good health, 84 and
upwards, one of 94.
   No person belonging to this place has been tried for any
capital crime these 40 years.  Some have been banished the
town for petty thefts, and other immoralities.
