   Church, etc.-The church was rebuilt in 1774, is very
neatly fitted up, and in excellent repair.  On the top of the
east gable, there is the figure of a cross, and on the west,
that of a crescent.  These were upon the gables of the old
church, and have been replaced upon the new.  This might
have given offence a century ago; but the people are now
wiser than to quarrel with a stone of any shape or appear-
ance.
   The manse, which was built for a bachelor, is too small
for the accomodation of a family.  Few houses of the kind,
however, are more pleasantly situated.  There is a good gar-
den.  The soil and exposure are so favourable, that crops
and fruits, of various kinds, are reaped from it earlier than
from any other in the parish.  The stipend is about L. 80
sterling, with a glebe of 6 acres.  Col. Eidingtoun, the pro-
prietor of the estate of Gargunnock, is the patron.

   Parish School.-The school-house is situated on a rising
ground, at the west end of the village.  It has two floors,
the first for the school, the second for the habitation of the
school-master.  During the winter season, there may be 50
or 60 scholars; and yet the whole income, including salary,
perquisites as Session-clerk, and school fees, scarcely amounts
annually to L. 16.  The reading of English is taught for a
merk Scots per quarter, writing and arithmetic for 2 shillings;
fees, which are by no means adequate to the troublesome
task of the master.  When a man decently qualified submits
to the drudgery of training up children in several important
branches of education, common sense must revolt at the idea

of the relations; who certainly deserved this disappointment, as they had
taken no notice of the deceased, while the lived.
