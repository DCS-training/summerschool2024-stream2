   Antiquities.-Of our antiquities, the ancient castle of the
Comyns, and that of the Maxwells, more remarkable in
the course of our history, have already been mentioned.
Notice has also been taken of the convent of Franciscans
which stood anciently here.  The street in which it stood, is
still called Friar's Vennel.  A small part of what is thought
to have been the kitchen or dormitory is still to be seen.
The bridge over the Nith, founded at the same time, has
never yet been taken down; and amidst all the repairs
which it has since received, some considerable part of the o-

monument to the late Duke of Queensberry has since been

vaults are said to have been used as a magazine for the mi-

building now remains; but it is remembered by all the old
people in town; and the vaults were found, within these
12 or 15 years, in digging for the foundation of the Duke's
monument.
   At the entrance into the town from the N. E. are still to
be seen the remains of the foundation of an old chapel, na-
med the Chrystal, or more properly St Christopher's chapel.
It was built by Bruce, as a place in which mass might be
said for the soul of his father-in-law, Sir Christopher Seton,
who was hanged on this spot by order of the English mo-
