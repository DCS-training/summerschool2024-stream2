     Statistical Account

the bounds of the parish, yet, being connected with it, ought
to be mentioned.  In the year 1788, Mr Whitworth the en-
gineer was employed to take a survey of the country, for the
purpose of bringing a navigable canal from the port of Ar-
broath to Forfar.  That gentlemen made out an accurate plan
of this canal, which he reported to be highly practicable.  It
required 25 locks to conduct it from Muirton Fulling Mill to
Arbroath; the distance 13 miles 1 firlong and 2 chains;
the perpendicular height above low water-mark 196 feet.
The expence he computed at L. 17,788 : 17 : 8.  As There
is no reason to believe the trade on this canal would at pre-
sent defray this expence, the plan is laid aside, and the sur-
veyor's Report is deposited in the town-clerk's offices in For-
far and Arbroath.  This useful work will probably be resu-
med again when the country shall have attained more wealth,
and further improvements.  It would serve to convey coal,
lime, and wood, into the center of a very populous country
destitute of these articles.
