L. 3254 Scotch; and the real rent is supposed to be L. 1500
Sterling.

   The living is L. 39: 8: 10 1/2 Sterling, including communion

   The manse was built in the year 1781.  And a new church
on a very good plan was erected in 1791.
   The number of poor receiving alms is only 12 at present;
but it maybe observed that in 1782 and 83, seasons of death
and scarcity, about 25 received quarterly supplies, besides in-
terim supplies which were given to several poor families.-At
that time the kirk session applied L. 15 Sterling of the money
settled on interest for the poor, which, together with the week-
ly collections made at the church, was applied in purchasing
pease, which were converted into meal, and distributed every
week among the poor, in proportion to the numbers in their
families.-They also received from government 12 bolls of
pease, which were managed as above mentioned, and after
that purchased 23 bolls more at a moderate price, also sent by
government, which the session sold to the moss indigent fami-
lies, for their relief.  The heritors also bought a considerable
quantity of pease, for the support of their tenants, and by this
means no person suffered through want.
   The annual amount of collections for the poor at the
church is about L. 17, and the interest of L. 75 at 4 1/2 per cent.
L. 3: 7: 6. making in all L. 20: 7: 6.*
