the north-west extremity of Dunnet-Head, which has been erect-
ed at a great expense, by the Commissioners for Northern
Lights. It has proved useful for vessels passing the frith,-
they. frequently mistaking the Bay of Dunnet for it, and get-
ting wrecked on the sands. Here, on a promontory nearly 500
feet above the level of the sea, exposed to the fury of the gales
from the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded with moss, and about
three miles from the nearest habitation, the art of man has made
a comfortable dwelling, a garden on deep moss producing fine
vegetables, and parks where tolerable crops of corn and grass
are raised on moss twelve feet deep. The principal light-keeper,
Mr Adair, deserves much credit for his perseverance as a culti-
vator.
                    III.-POPULATION.
   The population, till within sixty years ago consisted simply of
the proprietors and their tenants. The proprietors farmed the
Mains; the tenants had all more or less land allotted them, and
the pasturage in common. They ploughed the land for the pro-
prietors, carried the manure on their backs, or in creels on ponies.
They reaped, thrashed, and manufactured the crop, carried it to
market, and shipped it. They gave the proprietor part of their
sheep, cattle, swine, geese, hens and eggs, and a small victual and
money rent-they were, in fact, next thing to slaves. However,
in this state, it is said, the proprietors kept excellent tables and
lived well. The people, too, were not without their comforts.
All their clothing was of home manufacture, some remnants of
which are still to be seen-a kind of stuff of fine worsted, dyed
very dark blue. It served for coat, vest, and breeches for Sun-
days, and also for gowns to the females; a more comfortable dress
for a cold climate than the ruffles, ribbons, and flimsy fabrics now-
a-days of Glasgow and Manchester.
