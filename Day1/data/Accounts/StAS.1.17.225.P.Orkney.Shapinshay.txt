waving any farther consideration of this point, as it is a mat-
ter of no great importance, we may observe, that it has been
distinguished by the name which it now bears for these seve-
ral centuries.  To support this observation, we have the au-
thority of Torfacus, and the authors specified by him, and
also of the celebrated Buchanan, who not only mentions the
name of this island, but describes its situation and extent
with considerable accuracy.  'Littori propior Siapinsa paulum
"se in orientem inflectens, ex adverso Cracoviacae, (Kirkwall),
"duo millia sita, ispa sex millia longa."

   Situation, Extent, Form, Division, etc.-To the north of the
east part of the main-land, from which it is distant about
one mile, and three from Kirkwall, this island extends al-
most in the form of a cross, from Stromberry to Ness, near
7 miles, and from the Galt to the foot of Shapinshay, more
than 5.  The body of the cross stretches from south-west
to north-east, and the arms from south-east to north-west.
Almost around the whole island, the shores are low, pretty
level, and, to a considerable distance inland, covered with
rich fields of grass and corn.  Towards the middle, the land
rises considerably higher; and as the hand of industry has
never disturbed its repose since the creation, it exhibits the
appearance of a barren waste, fit only for sheep pasture.

   Ancient Custom.-As all the lands on the shore are pro-
perty, so the whole of the hill ground is commonty, and
they are divided from each other by what is here called a
hill-dyke, a species of fence, it is believed, almost peculiar to
this country.  The period when this kind of fence was
first in use in these islands is lost in the mist of antiquity.
They are common through most of the islands.  They are
built of turf.  They crumble down in winter, are repaired
