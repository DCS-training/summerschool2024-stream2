     General Appendix to

next to the parish of Moffat, which has taken an honourable
and distinguished lead in the business, Wamphray has fur-
nished the greatest number of volunteers for the defence of
the country.  Let it be remarked, as has been done in a pre-
vious account of this parish, written by an able and impartial
hand, that the heritors and farmers are a liberal and intelli-
gent class of men, who have the good sense to see that their
own interest and prosperity are interwoven with that of their
country.
