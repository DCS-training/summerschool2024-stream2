   The number or goats is inconsiderable, about 250.  Their
price is the same with that of sheep.
   Of horses the number cannot be laid down at less than
1000.  The common country breed is very small-sized; but,
when in good case, carry large loads, and are remarkably
hardy.  Their price has risen very high within these few
years.  A small gearran, bought about 10 years ago for less
than 2 L. cannot now be purchased for 3 L. 3 s.; and the best
of them sell from, 4 L. to 5 L.  The gentlemen have a stock
of larger horses on their farms, fit for drawing the plough
and cart.  Some of them have lately imported a few good
beasts fit for the saddle; and one gentleman has got a breed
of asses, which he expects may prove useful in the produc-

   To the account of the grazing stock, we add the number
of deer in the forest, and on the great commons of Harris
within Tarbert, which we suppose to be at least 800.  These

principal tacksmen as his forester to prevent poaching.  The
deer are very destructive to the corn and grass of the tenants,
whose farms lie in the neighbourhood of the forest and com-
mons.  Some of the uninhabited islands in the Sound of
Harris abound with rabbits, introduced some years ago by
the gentleman to whose farm these isles now belong.

   Kelp Manufactures.-Kelp is the staple, and, excepting the
few cows sold to the drovers, the only valuable article of ex-
portation which the country produces.  This manufacture
is thought to be brought to its utmost extent of late, in con-
sequence of the high prices some years ago, which encourag-
ed the people to convert all the sea-ware produced by these
shores into kelp, regardless of the detriment to their corns
and pastures, which have degenerated much through want
