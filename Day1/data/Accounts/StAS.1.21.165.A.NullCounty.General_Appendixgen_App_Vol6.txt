determined, that to obtain that necessary article neither pains
nor expence should be wanting.  Steps were accordingly
taken to ascertain in what manner it might be procured to
most advantage.
   Meanwhile, to prepare for new tenants, a second road pa-
rallel to the former, at the distance of half a mile, was im-
mediately begun and cut, with what water could be got,
down to the clay, 12 feet broad and 2670 yards long, quite
across the moss.  This opening was previously necessary, that
operators might get a drain formed in the clay to direct the
water; and it was to remain as a road that was absolutely ne-
cessary, and which relieved settlers from an expence they
were unable to support.  These preparations, the progress of
the former tenants, and the prospect of a farther supply of
water, induced 10 more to take possessions in the year 1783;
in the year 1784, 18 more took possessions; and in 1785 no
fewer than 27;-in all, 55 tenants in three years, which
disposed of 440 acres more of the High Moss.
   As the introduction of an additional stream to the moss
was to be a work both of nicety and expence, it was neces-
sary to proceed with caution.  For this reason several engi-
neers were employed to make surveys and plans of the dif-
ferent modes by which it might be procured.  In one point
they all agreed, that the proper source for furnishing that
supply was the river Teith; a large and copious stream that
passes within a mile of the moss: but various modes were
proposed for effecting that purpose.
   To carry a stream from the river by a cut or canal into
the moss was found to be impracticable; and Mr Whit-
worth* gave in a plan of a pumping machine, which he was
of opinion would answer the purpose extremely well.
