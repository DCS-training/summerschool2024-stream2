     Statistical Account

peaceble people, regular in their attendance on the ordi-
naces of religion, rather grave than lively, seldom in-
dulging themselves in any relaxation or diversion, except-
ing the young people, who sometimes take a dance at
Christmas, or at a penny-wedding*.  Crimes of great e-

regularity of conduct must in part be ascribed to the
poverty and depression of the people; for the situation

rents of their farms, and the wages of their servants, have
of late been considerably advanced.  The last article, in 
particular, is nearly doubled within these 25 years past.
One advantage they derive from their vicinity to the sea,

apothecary, negro, Jew, gipsy,  Englishman, Irishman, fo-
reigner of any description, nor family of any religious sect-
or denomination, except the Established Church.
   There are 4 ale-houses, and fewer would hardly accom-
modate the neighbourhood, as there is generally a resort of
strangers to sea-port towns.  There can be no doubt but

*A penny-wedding is when the expence of the marriage entertain-
ment is not dehayed by the young couple, or their relagions, but by a
club among the guests.  Two hund ed people of both serves, will some
times be convened on an occasion of this lind.
