any animals that are uncommon.  The animal of the greatest
value, and chiefly attended to, is the sheep:  By far the great-
est part of the parish is occupied in breeding them.  The
number may be about 8000.  They are of the long white
faced kind, which bears the short clothing wool, somewhat
inferior in size, as well as in fineness of wool, to the sheep of the
Cheviot Hills.  Having been thought defective in shape, from
the lightness of the fore quarter, about 20 years ago an at-
tempt was made to improve it, by means of rams of a breed
highly esteemed in England.  The experiment was repeated,
until it was found, that the quality of the wool was thereby
deteriorated.  Judicious farmers now study to improve the
shape of the breed, by selecting the best lambs of both sexes
for breeding, without introducing a foreign mixture; and to
enlarge the size and render the wool finer, by increasing the
shelter upon their farms, by affording their flocks plenty of
food, and by rendering their pasture sweeter and better.  For
this last purpose, keeping a less stock, and draining of boggy
or marshy land, are reckoned of great service, and attended to
by good managers.  Turnips and broad clover have not been
given to sheep, in this parish, except for fattening them; al-
though this practice prevails much in other parts of the coun-
ty of Roxburgh.  But rye-grass is esteemed a good spring
food, where the situation of a farm admits of its being raised
in abundance.  In smearing, a much greater proportion of
butter is used than formerly; but the total disuse of tar has
never had a good effect.
