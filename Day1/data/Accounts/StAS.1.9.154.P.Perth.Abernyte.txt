called Druidical, consisting now only of seven stones.  And
in Stockmuir, about a mile from this one, there is another
of nine stones; both have consisted of more; three or four
have been taken from the first not long ago.  In a few
years, there will be no vestige of either.  This last is situ-
ated just at the foot of Dunfinnan Hill, on which was the
residence of the famous Macbeth.  The site of his castle
was admirably chosen for a place of defence, being a coni-
cal rising on the west end of the hill, almost inaccessible, ex-
cept on one side.  The excellence of its situation had be-
fore pointed it out to Kenneth III. and other Kings, as a se-
cure place of residence.  The site of the castle is within
the parish of Collace.-Upon the top of King's-seat, ano-
ther part of the same hill, in this parish, there is the ruin of
a circular inclosure, similar to Macbeth's castle, but much
smaller.  This, as it commanded a more extensive prospect
than the castle itself, taking in beside a vast extent of coun-
try, great part of the sea-coast, from the mouth of the frith
of Forth to the South Esk, probably was a watch-tower
or out-post, and, from this circumstance, had received its
name.  So prevalent is the notion, that all great atchieve-
ments in former times, were performed by men of superior
size and strength, that Macbeth's castle, though the history of
it is so well known, is called by no other name, among
the vulgar, than the Giants House.
