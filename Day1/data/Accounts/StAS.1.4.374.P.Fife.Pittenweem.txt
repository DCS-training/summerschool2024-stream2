     Statistical Account

tions, upwards of 60 received charity.  The funds for
their support, arising from lands and weekly collections,
are from L. 50 to L. 60 Sterling yearly.  The tailors
have a fund, considerably above L. 100 a year, for the
support of their own poor.  They are able to make a
very decent provision for the widows, both of shipmasters,
and of common mariners.  This society obtained about 6
yeas ago a royal charter.  The trades have likewise a
fund for their poor, which I believe is about L. 20 year.
There are other two charitable societies, but they are still
is infancy, and their annual produce is inconsiderable, but
from the nature of them they must grow.  One of these
societies is formed by the people connected with the col-
liery.  This seems to be a most laudable and humane in-
sitution, as accidents often happen at collieries, and it
were to be wished that it generally obtained at all public
works.

   Prices and Wages.-The prices of provisions are nearly
doubled within these 30 years.  Beef, veal, mutton, lamb
and port, are generally sold at 4 d. the lb.; geese, at 2 s.
6 d.; ducks at 8 d.; hens at 11 d.; and rabbits at 3 d.;
butter is generally 8 d. the 1b.; grain is generally 2 s. the
boll below the Mid Lothian fiars.  The fuel made use of
is coal, and the price of 400 weight is 1 s. 3 d. carriage in-
cluded.  The wages of domestic female servants are gene-
rally L. 2, 10 s. a-year.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people in general are
economical.  Land is often changing proprietors, and the
general price is 25 years purchase.  The people do enjoy
the comforts of society, and are contented with their
situation.-The roads in the parish are very indifferent.
