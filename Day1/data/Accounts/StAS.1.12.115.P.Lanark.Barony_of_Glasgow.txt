Glasgow and neighbourhood.  This colour is so fast, or fixed,
that when wove with brown cotton, or linen yarn, it re-
sists and stands the whole process of bleaching, and acquires
more beauty and lustre by this trying operation; and when
wrought in with bleached yarn, requires 24 hours boiling in
soap and ashes, to reduce it to its vivid standard.  Acids,
which destroy most other reds, in a moderate degree, improve
this.  Making Turkey red is a most intricate and troublesome
process, requiring about 15 different operations in the com-
mon course of dying.
   Near to the cudbear manufacture, is just now commenced
a business carried on by George and Charles Mackintosh, en-
tirely new in this, or, we believe, in any other country.  It
is the making of a newly discovered chymical preparation,
which answers as a real substitute in dying and printing, for
saccharum saturni, or sugar of lead and allum.  It is hoped it
will be an useful undertaking, as hitherto all, or by far the
greatest part of the sugar of lead used in Britain has been im-
ported from Holland.  There ingenious and economical
pie, though a duty of 3 d. the pound is imposed on this ar-
ticle when imported, and though receiving their lead from
Britain, yet have hitherto been able to undersell all who have
made any attempt of the same kind in this kingdom.  Mr.
Mackintosh and his son Charles intended this for a sugar of
lead business; but in the course of their experiments in that
way, this improvement occurred to Charles Mackintosh, who
is a very able chymist; and the work is now entirely employ-
ed for this purpose.  They supply the printers with this pre-
paration at a lower rate than that which is usually made from
the Dutch sugar of lead.  The principal printfields in the
country have tried, are now using, and approve of it, as mak-
ing an equally fixed, and, at the fame time, a more beautiful
colour than that done in the usual manner with sugar of lead
