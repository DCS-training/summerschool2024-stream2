These consist generally of stone-dikes, or of hedges composed of
beech and thorn. Several substantial stone-dikes have recently
been erected throughout the parish, for enclosing fields, and se-
parating the arable from the pasture grounds. Many such fen-
ces are still required.
	The great distance from markets, and from lime nr marl, are
the chief obstacles to agricultural improvement which the farmers
in the upper districts of the parish have to contend with; besides,
the crops of corn, before they are sufficiently ripened, are apt to be
occasionally injured by the autumnal evening frosts which are so
common in upland districts.
	Whilst the farmers are, in general, particularly attentive to the
proper management of their sheep and cattle, as a body they are
no less attentive to the proper management of the lands, which
they have under a regular rotation of cropping, by draining, by
enclosing, by an application of lime or marl, and an observance of
that mode of farming which is considered most suitable to the dis-
trict. The receive the greatest encouragement for the improve-
ment of their farms, and of their live-stock, from the Noble and
honourable proprietors of the parish.
