which were sacred to Loda, the favourite deity of the antient
Scandinavians.  Fields of battle can be still traced; but as
these were the result of clannish and provincial seuds, a par-

   Church, etc.-The church is placed within a mile of the
eastern extremity of the parish.  It continues to be only
thatched with heather, but is well seated, and has a large and
well-toned bell, which was captured in a French man of
war, and presented to the parish by the late Admiral Sir
John Lockhart Ross.  Tain is the presbytery seat.  The
church is 14 miles to the west of that burgh.  The manse
was lately repaired.  The stipend is only 70 L.  Sterling, and
being all paid in money, makes the living by far the poorest
in the synod of Ross, Contin excepted.  The present in-
cumbent is married, and hath 9 children living.  Six are
dead.  There are two preaching stations besides the church,
viz.  Amat in Strath Carron, and Doun in Strath Oigeal;
the one 10, and the other 14 miles, distant from the manse.
The parish was long supplied by the committee for manag-

catechists.  These, however, about 2 years ago, were with-
drawn, a measure most prejudicial to the temporal and spiritual
interests of the people residing in the Highlands where they
preached.  The inhabitants then could seldom have the
means of instruction; the distance of many from the parish
church, making the journey tedious and fatiguing, and, in
bad weather, dangerous.  Marriages and baptisms, however,
obliged many to come to church, on which occasions a
great expence was incurred; for the open-hearted con-
vivial Highlander, would not pass a public house, without
entertaining those who attended him, to the number, per-
haps, of two thirds of a village, made up of his relations
