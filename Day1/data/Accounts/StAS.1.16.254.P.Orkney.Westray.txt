requires very little of the harrow, which instrument is gene-
rally made with wooden teeth.  In some places, it is true, the
better and more substantial farmers, and where the soil is
stronger, begin now to use the iron-teethed harrow.  How-
ever, it may be depended upon as a certain fact, that agri-
culture will only be a secondary consideration in this coun-
try, while kelp continues to sell at any tolerable price; and
in this the landholders cannot be blamed, as the kelp yields
them ready and certain profits.  Many of the lands in
Orkney, which are burdened with high superiorities, with-
out this valuable article of kelp, would have long ago been
in the hands of the superior.

   Churches, etc.-There are three churches or places of
worship in this parish, two in the island of Westray, one of
which is called St Mary's, and the other Cross Kirk; St
Mary's kirk is distant from the manse above 4 English
miles; the other, Cross Kirk, is distant 3 miles, and the
kirk or place of worship in the island of Papa Westray, is
distant from the manse a space of between 8 and 9 English
miles.  The minister preaches in these different parts of
worship by rotation, at least when the weather permits him
to pass the ferry to Papa Westray.  It must appear pretty
singular, that all these places of worship are placed at such
a distance from the manse; the space between the manse
and the place of worship in the island of Papa Westray, is a
journey which can scarcely be accomplished in the space of
two hours.
   This charge might have been rendered more commo-
dious for the minister, and centrical for the people, by re-
moving the manse from its present situation.  But though
the present incumbent petitioned the heritors for this pur-
pose, they would not agree to any proposal of this kind.
The present incumbent could not afford to lay out money
