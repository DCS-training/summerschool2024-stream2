representative of the Viscounts of Oxenford.  The man-
sion house and lands of East Caickmoor, though disjoined
by the parish of Crichton, yet belong to this parish, and
pay stipend to the minister.-The poor are supported from
the weekly collections, and the interest of money left by
charitable persons for their behoof; a fund which has hi-
therto answered every demand, and consequently there has
been no assessment.  The number of poor is from 14 to
19, and their capital at interest is L. 357 Sterling.  In this
parish, there is a Friendly Society, lately instituted for the
support of its distressed members and indigent widows.
The regulations, dictated by experience, or copied from
similar societies of a long standing, seem well calculated to
answer the ends of the institution.  Such associations merit
the countenance of the landed interest, because they tend
to lessen the number of the poor, and retard a general as-
sessment.
