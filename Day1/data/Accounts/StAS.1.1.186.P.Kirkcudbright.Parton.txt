   Mineral Springs, Lakes, and Rivers.-There is a mineral
spring, which is supposed to possess, in some degree, the qua-
lities of the old well at Mossat.  It was formerly much fre-
quented by the common people, but is now quite neglected.
No cures have been properly authenticated.  Perhaps the
water was used in an injudicious manner.  There are seven
small lakes plentifully stored with trout.  The river Dee joins
the Ken about half a mile above the kirk, from whence it
has the name  Dee  till it enters the Solway Frith at Kirkcud-
bright.  In a flood, the Dee sometimes rises 8 feet perpen-
dicularly, by which large tracts of meadow ground are over-
flowed.  This, in summer, is very hurtful to the hay; but,
in winter and spring, considerably improves  the crop.  Op-
posite to Parton, the river is from 100 yards to half a mile
broad, and from 10 to 30 feet deep.  It abounds in pike and
perch.  The former are caught from 3 to 40 lb; the latter
from 1 to 4 or 5.  Formerly the moors afforded great plen-
ty of black and red game; hares and partridges are still in
abundance; woodcocks appear in the end of October.

   Quarries.-A slate quarry, not a mile from the river, was
formerly wrought, but by unskillful management has gone
into disrepute.  In the opinion of judges, it might still be
rendered valuable, considering the spirit of improvement,
especially of building, which seems to prevail much in this
part of the country.
