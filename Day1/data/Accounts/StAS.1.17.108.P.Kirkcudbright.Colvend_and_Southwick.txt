   Minerals*-The rocks and stones, which abound so much
in this parish are all of hard granite, many of them inter-
spersed with veins of flint or spar.  They furnish excellent
materials for walls and fences.  There is likewise a quarry
of a free or foster species of granite, on one part of the
shores which is worked for mill-stones, and from whence all
the mills in the south-west of Scotland are furnished.  Ma-
ny of them are also carried into the interior parts of the
country, anti some are sent to Ireland.  From 20 to 15 are
sold annually at about 3 l. each.

   Fuels.-There are very many small spots of peat moss in
the parish, which are now much exhausted.  The prepara-
tion of this kind of fuel, upon which the role dependence
of the generality of the inhabitants has hitherto been, is
here attended with vast expence of time and labour, and af-

to agree very well.  He was observed to delight much in crop-
ping the heather, and to prefer it to every other plant the cli-
mate produced.  He lived 18 months in the country, and ex-
perienced all our variety of season.  He propagated with a
ewe of this country; but both he and his offspring were killed
by some other animal, by which means the breed was unfortu-
nately lost.

*About 25 years ago, a copper mine was opened in this
parish, near the rocky shore.  A considerable quantity of ore
was dug up, and sent in calks to a smelting furnace at some
distance.  It was found to be rich, and actually produced as
much copper as cleared all charges upon it; but the work was
relinquished.  The estate, upon which it was found, was then
the paternal estate of the late Countess of SUTHERLAND and La-
dy GLENORCHY, but is new the property of Mr OSWALD of
Auchencruive.
