called moss or peats.  The inhabitants are supplied with peats
from the mosses of Foudland, in the parish of Forgue, and of
Auchintoul, in the parish of Marnoch.  They also burn a kind
of turf, which they get upon the hills.  Banff is the nearest
sea-port where coals can be got, which is about 12 English
miles distant from the church.

   Ecclesiastical Matters.-The church and manse are situated
in a narrow valley, near the bank of the Deveron.  The pa-
rish formerly belonged to the Synod of Moray and Presby-
tery of Huntly.  An exchange was made with the parish of
Mortlich, which originally was in the Synod of Aberdeen
and Presbytery of Turriff, and the minister of Inverkeithny
still draws 6 s. 8 d. Sterling as the feu-duty of a house in El-
gin, which has, probably, been one of the stalls in the ca-
thedral at Elgin.  There are no dissenters from the Establish-
ed Church, except a few members of the Episcopal Church of
Scotland.

   Population.-The population of Inverkeithny has decreased
considerably within there 20 years.  This has been partly oc-
casioned by the scarcity of fuel, but chiefly by the farmers
thinking, from the high prices obtained for castle and grain,
that they had more profit, by cultivating their farms them-
selves, than by subsetting a considerable part of them, as was
formerly done in all the northern parts of Scotland.
