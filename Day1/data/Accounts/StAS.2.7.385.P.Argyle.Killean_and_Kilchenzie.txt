    some chips of burned wood, which sanctions the belief that our
    forefathers were in the practice of burning their dead.
      in the recess of a soft freestone rock, not far from the sea,
    where a farmer was lately preparing to erect a cart shade, and had
    commenced to level the bottom, he met with a great collection
    of sea shells, and discovered in the face of the rock several aper-
    tures, or squareholes, crammed with human bones. He imme-
    diately desisted from his operations, and left undisturbed the re-
    positories of the dead.
      In the south division of the parish, two circular inclosures, com-
    monly known as Diinfhiizn, or Fingal's fort, and Diin-niafoghmhar
    or Gianes fort, attract the attention of the traveller.  They seem
    to have stood for many ages, and baffle conjecture to account
    for their origin.  The vulgar, who are fond of the marvellous, con-
    sider them ancient residences of Fingal and his giants,-and the an-
    tiquary, Druidical places of worship.  At this distant period of
    time, without written records to throw any light upon the subject,
    it is very difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion with re-
    gard to their original design.  As inclosures of a similar nature
    frequently occur in the Highlands of Scotland, and have been uni-
    formly erected upon elevated situations, it is by no means impress
    bable that they might have been originally intended as places of
    temporary retreat and security for some of the domesties and cattle
    of the natives, when engaged in battle with their enemies.

      The causes of the decrease of population can only be attri-
    buted to emigration and the suppression of smuggling. Emi-
    gration has been partially carrying on since 1821. Prior to
    the year 182), a majority of cottagers, and day-labourers
    supported large families by the profits of smugfled whisky,
    -a trade which, though lucrative in itself, proved very Inju-
    riOus to their morals. A professed smuggler could clear free
    Of all expenses, 1 Os. per week, which enabled him to keep a horse
    and an.additional cow.  The necessary assistance of a wife could
