Banks and Dr Solander, that this bag contained the re-
mains or ashes of his wife, or of some near relation, after
burning.
   In the second of these chests was found a skeleton in a
sitting posture, as if seated on the ground, and the legs
stretched out horizontally.  To keep the body erect, stones
were built up opposite to the breast, as high as the crown
of the head.  The whole was covered with a large stone.
   In the third chest was found, in one end, the bones of a
human body thrown together promicuously; in the other
end, a quantity of chesnut-coloured hair, covered with a

which was a locket of bone, and underneath the beads a

the first chest.  When the hair was first touched it ap-
peared rotten, and the beads friable; but when exposed to
the air, the hair was found to be strong, and the beads hard.
The beads were black, but it could not be discovered what
they were composed of.
   Several other tumuli have been opened, which had much
the same appearance.  In some of there tumuli were found
stone-chests of about 15 or 18 inches square, in which chests
were deposited urns containing ashes; in others of these
chests were found ashes and fragments of bones, without
urns.
   In digging for stones, in one of these tumuli was found
an urn shaped like a jar, and of a size sufficient to contain
30 Scotch pints.  It contained ashes and fragments of
bones.  The colour on the outside was that of burnt cork,
and on the inside grey.  The country man who found it,
left it exposed to the air for a night, with a view to have
taken it up whole next day; but one of his neighbours
