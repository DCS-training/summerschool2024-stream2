   Education.--In 1838, the Societv in Scotland for Propagating
Christian Knowledge received on their scheme the school of Gol-
lanfield, at the east end of the parish. *  The school accommodates
a district of Croy, as the Society's school at Culloden (Inverness)
is available to the west end of this parish. The parish and other
school in Ardersier and Croy are more convenient for some of
the parishioners than are the schools within the parish; and hence,
of the children of this parish, there are, on an average yearly, at
the parish school of Pettie about 50; Ardersier, 12; Croy, 40;
Society school, Gollanfield, 55; Culloden, (Inverness,) 48. In
Campbeltown, (Forsyth's,) 15; female (reading school,) 6;
Long's, 21; infant, 3; total, 250. In the Society's schools, Cul-
loden and Gollanfield schools are kept on the Sabbath evening; and
during the summer months, in the church, also, before service, a
scbool is open to all who choose to attend; but is chiefly designed
for those in service, of whom there are manv more in the parish
unable to read than, for its credit, we should like to state in round
numbers. We fear there are not few parents, who are indiffe-
rent to the education of their male children, and consider it
entirely superfluous for females. The above observation is by no
means confined to the fishers of our population. But we hope that
such feelings and views are daily losing ground among the people.
   The want of a school for the instruction of females is much
felt. Were the heritors to give a house and a small cohtribution
for this purpose, they could hardly bestow a greater boon upon
the people. It is lamentable to see poor girls under the necessity
of expending the earnings of one term, at a period of life when
they become almost ashamed to confess their ignorance, in board-
ing themselves at Inverness, as long as they can during the next,
in order to possess those common qualifications with which others
more favourably situated begin service. Were the proprietors resi-
dent, the female members of their families would eonsider such a

<FOOTNOTE>Government have allowed L.40 to aid the erection of the school-house here; but,
although the building is finished, we are not yet in circumstances to implement the
condition annexed to the grant.
