of old age.  But the smallnests of the funds, and
a virtous feeling of decent pride, prevent many from
applying and receiving assistance, who yet stand much in
need of a small addition to the income arising from the
fruits of their own industry.
   Whether it be practicable in an advanced state of so-
ciety, to introduced such meliorations into the situation of
the labouring poor, as to enable them to rear a family
of children, without suffering the extremes of hunger
and nakedness, and to lay up a small pittance for their
support in sickness and old age,-whether this be a prac-
ticable improvement, is a political question which it is
not perhaps casy to resolve; but it is a certain fact,
which often affects, with unavailing melancholy, the
minds of those who are called by their profession to visit
the poor, that common labourers, in the time of their
strength, cannot afford to purchase for a numerous fami-
ly of children, the bare necessaries of life; and after 40,
when the vigour of life is over, they generally languish
and decay for want of the more delicate nourishment,
which declining nature then seems to require.  In the
present state of things, it seems to be the intention of
Providence, that even the industrious poor should depend,
for a considerable share of their comfort in life, upon the
generosity and beneficence of the rich among whom they
live; and the rich are, in this way, furnished with an
opportunity of gratifying the most amiable feelings of
the human heart, and of practicing virtues from which
the mind derives at once the highest improvement and
sweetest delight.
