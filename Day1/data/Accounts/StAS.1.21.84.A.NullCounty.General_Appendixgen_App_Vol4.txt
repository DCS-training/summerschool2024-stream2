   In regard to the succession of ministers in this parish, let
it be observed, that one Mr. Blackie, the first Presbyterian
minister here, was translated from Redgorton, in the presby-
tery of Perth, June 1st 1710; the cure was served before by
a Mr. Carstairs, who was alive at that time, and continued
for some years after to have a place of worship in the parish
for the benefit of the Episcopals in it who still adhered to
him.  Mr. Blackie died about the end of 1723, and was suc-
ceeded by Mr. Ogilvy, who was translated to be one of the
ministers of Aberdeen, anno 1727.  Mr. Ranken succeeded
Mr. Ogilvy, and died anno 1737.  In 1738, Mr. Randal suc-
ceeded Mr. Ranken, and was translated to Stirling anno 1769.
He was succeeded by his son.   And, in November 1773, Mr.
Randal, junior, now one of the ministers of Edinburgh, was
admitted one of the ministers of Glasgow.  The present mi-
nister of this parish was translated from Newburgh, Fife,
where he was minister near 12 years, the 1st of June 1774.
