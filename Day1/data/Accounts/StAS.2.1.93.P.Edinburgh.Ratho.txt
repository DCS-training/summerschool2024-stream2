      1838, from a survey made for this Account Mr Thomas Wallace,
            a member of Session,                             1454

   It appears from the above tatements, that the population of the
parish has fluctuated considerably between different periods. Since
the vear in which the last Statistical Account was compiled, till the
last Government census, an interval of thirty-nine years, there wasan
increase of 489; and from 1831 to 1838, there has been an addition
of 149. The former increase is to be ascribed to three causes,-
the improvement in the agriculture of the parish, and the additional
number of bands required for its operations; the cutting of the
Canal, which has increased the facility of communication between
this parish and the surrounding country, and the opening up some
stone quarries in the neighbourhood of the village. The latter
increase, from 1831 to the present time, is to be ascribed to the
continued operation of the same causes, together with the greater
subdivision of the land in the parish, the building of new miansions
by the proprietors, and the formation of establishments in con-
nection with them. It is proper to mention that, in the census
taken for 1838, two families are included, who had rented during
summer the unoccupied mansions of two of the heritors.
   Of the population above specified there are
