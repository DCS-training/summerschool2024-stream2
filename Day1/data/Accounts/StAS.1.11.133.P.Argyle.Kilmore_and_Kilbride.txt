in this country for trade.  The next building was a custom-
house, which was erected 28 years ago; Oban being reckoned
a proper place for clearing out vessels nor the herring fishery.
It was soon after made the place of general rendezvous for
the herring busses; and for many years, they resorted to it in
great numbers, till other places of the same kind were ap-
pointed.  About the year 1778, the spirit of building arose
in this village, and has been gradually increasing till the pre-
sent time.  It was on that side of Oban which belongs to the
Duke of ARGYLL, that these buildings were first erecred.  But
now, Mr. CAMPBELL of Dunstaffnage has feued out part of his
property, for the same purpose, on the other side; and the
demand for new lots daily increases.  Behind the village, there
is a shallow lake of some extent, with sloping banks, which
are cultivated for hay, corn, and garden stuffs.  The lake
might, at some expence, be drained.  There is also a water
that runs from it, into the sea, and divides the Duke of Ar-
gyll's farm from Dunstaffnage's lands.

   Bay and Shipping.-The Bay of Oban is of a semicircular
form, and from 12 to 24 fathom deep.  It is large enough to
contain 500 sail of merchantmen.  The anchorage is every
where good.  About 20 years ago, there were from 20 to
30 vessels registered at Oban, which were chiefly employed in
the fisheries; but, from the decrease of that trade on the
N. W. coast, the number of vessels is now much smaller.
Still, however, there are from 15 to 20 sloops employed in
the fishing and coasting business; and one vessel, from 250 to
300 tons, is employed in the Baltic trade.  But the traders,
and inhabitants in general, labour under great inconvenience
for want of a proper query to discharge their goods.  It is
hoped this defect will soon be supplied.
