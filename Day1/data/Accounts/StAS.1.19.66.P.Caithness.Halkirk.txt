     Statistical Account

and provided in carts, it would have made this business
more tolerable and profitable; but, on the contrary, they
carry them the distance of 9 or 10 miles, and in bad roads,
and on their horses backs; and six horses will not carry
what one cart would hold, and one horse would carry in
that cart with ease; mere necessity is the cause of this
wretched business.
   From the same cause it is also, that numbers of these
small tenants sell, early of the year, and at a low price,
the victual that should go to support their families, and pay
the master.  By this means, in order to silence the clamo-
rous dun of their creditors, who, no doubt, may avail them-
selves of their necessity, little remains for the rent and the
family; and if it should so happen that they pay the rent,
yet they are, at the long run, reduced to the necessity of
buying victual at a dearer rate than they sold; and if they
have no money or credit, as for the most part they have
not, the master must interpose with his purse or his victual,
or they must starve.  Very often they make whisky of
their beer, with a pretence to make money for the rent.
By this business, whatever profit the distiller may have, I
am sure they can have none, but rather loss, considering
the time spent, the duty paid, the whisky drunk, the pot
hire, as they call it, and the want of the draff and burnt
ale, which go to the distiller.  Now, from what I have
said about farms, it is not to be understood that I allude to
the positive dearness of tacks.  No; I all along alude to
their relative dearness, or as they stand with respect to the
present state, of things in the parish,

   Services.-I have mentioned services more than once as
a grievance.  They are so, and ought to be abolished, if
for no other reason, yet for this great one, vis. that the te-
