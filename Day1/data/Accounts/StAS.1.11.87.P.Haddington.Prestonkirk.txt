would have beamed through indolence itself; of industry,
which might have overtaken even the career of genius; both
consecrated; by the energy of the purest principles, to the glory
of his Maker, and the good of his fellow creatures.

   Civil State.-There are 6 considerable heritors in this pa-
rish; 1 of whom only, (Mr. Buchan Hepburn of Smeaton),
resides*.  This non-residence of the proprietors, is an un-
favourable circumstance to the poor's funds, in respect to the
collections at the church; 20 L. annually of assessment being
necessary to supply the deficiency.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The present church was built in the year
1770.  The manse is old, and in bad repair.  The stipend, ac-
cording to an augmentation lately granted, consists of 8 chalders
3 bolls of victual, and 46 L. 15 s. 5 d. of money, with a glebe
of 7 acres.

   Manners of the People.-The uniform, unremitting, but
healthy labours of agriculture, which occupy the great ma-
jority of the inhabitants of this parish, are probably favour-
able both to their morals and happiness.  They are, in general,
industrious and contented with their lot.  Possessing, as they
do, the blessings of liberty, protection, and equal laws, with
the means of providing, for themselves and families, the neces-
saries, and, to a certain degree, even the comforts of life, he
would not be their friend, who would seek to agitate their
minds with speculative sources of discontent.

on an elegant and extensive plan; and, by its commanding situation, forms a
great ornament of this part of the country.
