yoked to each; but single horse carts are often used, in 
which it is asserted one horse can draw 12 cwt. as easily as
two do 16 in the former.  Corn carts are simple machines,
mounted occasionally upon the wheels of the dung carts, for
driving hay or unthreshed grain.  There are many drill
ploughs; plenty of stone rollers 5 1/2 feet long, and 14 inches
diameter; a few of Mr Sandiland's sod-cutters; some very
complete threshing machines upon a large scale, and one of
a peculiar construction invented by Mr Robertson at Gran-

the former, answers the purpose sufficiently, and, costing
only L. 20, is within the reach of even the inferior order of
farmers*.

   Draught Cattle.-All draught work in the parish is per-
formed by horses, which come chiefly from Linlithgow and
Lanark thires, measure from 15 to 16 hands high, and cost
from L. 16 to L. 20.  There may be about 200 horses now
employed in husbandry work, whereas the number was for-
merly double, when four horses were almost universally
yoked to each plough.

   Prices of Labour.-There are about 100 ploughmen and
carters, whole annual wages are from L. 4 to L. 5 in money,
20 s. for kitchen+, 10 s. for two pair of shoes, 6 1/2 bolls of
oat-meal, diet in harvest, a free house and garden, the car-
riage of their coals, and some small perquisites, all which
