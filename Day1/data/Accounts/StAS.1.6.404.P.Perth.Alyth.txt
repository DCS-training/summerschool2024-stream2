Comparative View of the state of the funds for the support of
the poor, and the number of paupers for fifteen years, from
the 1st of January 1776, when this scheme commenced in
the parish of Alyth, dividing the time into three periods.

   From this state it appears that the number of poor is decreas-
ing, and the expence diminishing.  This is to be ascribed to
the improving state of the parish, and an increasing spirit of
industry among the people.  The linen manufacture affords
employment for old and young of both sexes, and the price of
labour is greatly advanced.  None are admitted on the poor's
roll who have not been three years at least in the parish, before
they fell into necessitous circumstances, and they sign a bond
giving the kirk-session a right to the whole or as much of their
effects at their death, as will reimburse the parish for money
they received from the poor's funds.  The session reserve the half
of the weekly collections, which they give occasionally to poor
families, and individuals not on the roll.  Begging is not allow-
ed in the parish.

*Servants wages have increased at least one third since 1773.  Men ser-
vants hired at that time for 5 or 6 guincas, are now with difficulty engaged
