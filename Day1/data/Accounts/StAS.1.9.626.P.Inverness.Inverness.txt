   Clubs.-There are two clubs in the town for supporting
the members which belong to them in sickness and old
age, and defraying the funeral expenses of themselves and
their wives.  The first is restricted to 161 members.  E-
very member pays 30 s. into the box at entrance, 1 s. on
the first Tuesday of every month throughout the year, 1 s.
on the death of every member, and 6 d. on the death of
every member's wife.  They have in return, when sick
and unable to work, 6 s. a-week during the first 6 months
of their illness, and 4 s. a-week afterward, during their
life, while they are unable to work, etc.  The other club
is formed on much the same plan; but pays only half the
above sum at entrance, and the returns in proportion.

   Battles.-There were in ancient times several unimpor-
tant rencounters and skirmishes in this parish.  The on-
ly memorable battle was that of the 16th of April 1746.
By a curious coincidence, the important and decisive bat-
tle of Culloden was fought on the moor of the paternal
estate of that truly great and good man, whose influence
in the Highlands, and unwearied perseverance during the
two preceding years, made the suppression of a very a-
larming insurrection comparatively easy to Government.
The services which, on this critical occasion, the Lord
President Forbes rendered to his country, will be recorded
by the faithful historian of the transactions of those times,
with pleasure and the warmest gratitude.
