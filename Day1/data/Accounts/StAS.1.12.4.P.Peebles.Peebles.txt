potatoes with the plough; and besides having his ground 
cleaned and manured, has a reasonable rent for his lands, and 
price for his labour.  The little tenants furnish the dung and 
seed, assist in cleaning the ground, and planting the potatoes, 
hoe and dig them after their hours of working, which contri-
butes to their health, and have their potatoes for half of the 
price at which they could otherwise purchase them, and which, 
to many families, furnish a third part of their subsistence at 
a very cheap rate. 

   Animals.-The Tweed abounds not only with trout, but
salmon, which visit the higher parts of it for spawning, to-
wards the end of the year.  Accordingly the Peebles Arms 
are 3 salmon.  In the parish there are 200 horses, and 500 
cows, both much better than in former times.  The number 
of sheep is about 8000.  The ancient kind is still generally 
retained; but by their being kept fewer in number, and being 
better fed, they are much improved in quality.  As the 
grounds in this part of the country are generally dry and 
healthy, the sheep are not so liable to disease as in many other 
places.  Of these, what is called the sickness, is generally the 
most common and the most fatal.  It is an inflammation in 
the bowels, brought on by the full habit of the animal, by 
sudden heats and colds, by eating wet and frosted grass, or by 
lying on wet grounds; and might, in most cases, be prevent-
ed by bleeding, by gentle treatment, and by change of pas-
ture.  It is a pity that most harmless, and the most useful 
of all animals should, in this respect, have so long been the 
most neglected.  By a better knowledge of the diseases of the 
sheep, their natural causes, and the means of preventing or 
curing them, many thousands of them might be annually sav-
ed to their proprietor, and to the country.
