master's salary; the poor man's rent is considerably augmen-
ted by such items.-These things I don't mention as griev-
ances, for the tenant subscribes to them with open eyes; nor
can the landlord be called an oppressor, because he receives
them; they are all prestations of a fair contract; and of
course, if the proprietor did not exact them, he would be
entitled to more rent:  I simply state them as defects in our
mode of husbandry; and which it would be the interest
both of landlord and tenant to have removed-Let the ten-
ant know determinately what he is to pay, and let him have
the complete use of his time, and the complete management
of the product of his farm.  As to a regular rotation of crops,
it is but little known in this district.  The old mode of al-
lowing the land to ly ley for three years, and then liming it,
and taking three crops of oats, is, indeed, fast wearing out
but no regular system is as yet introduced in its stead.
   The rent of the arable land per acre, is stated in the fol-

lords, that the raising the rents of their lands forced the tenants to be more
active, might be productive of some good effect; providing that indolence
was the only impediment to a flourishing state of agriculture in this parish:
Compulsion is but a bad argument, when the object of that compulsion
has not strength to obey:  I could with that such an idea was exploded; for
it is no longer the interest of this country to consider the tenantry upon an
estate, as part of that estate.
In England, things seem to be better managed.  There are still several
servitudes remaining in this parish, annexed to the leases of lands, such as
kain hens, and the driving of the lairds coals; these are indeed but small to
what took place about 30 years ago; but, even these are fetters upon the in-
dustry of the tenants;-of more hurt to them than of benefit to the landlord;
and it is to be hoped, from the many instances of an enlightened mind which
the present proprietors have shown: that all such casualties will be abolished
on the first opportunity.
