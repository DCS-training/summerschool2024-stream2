     of Inveresk.

half a mile in breadht, there is a fine rising ground, which 
begins at the eastern extremity of the parish, and extends 
in a swelling curve to the hill of Inveresk, where stand 
the village of that name, and the church of St Michael's.
Tne S. side of this hill takes also the form of a crescent, so 
that all the houses on that side have a full view of the 
woods of Dalkeith Park, and the extensive country to the 
south, as well as of the haugh and river, and their own
sloping gardens. 

   Climate,etc.-This situation makes the village not only
agreeable, but healthy, and obtained for it of old the name 
of the Montpellier of Scotland.  The soil of the plain, espe
cially about Musselburgh, being remarkably dry, and a 
constant brilliancy and freshness flowing from the river and 
the adjacent sea, there is a softnes and amenity in the air 
through the whole season, that is seldom to be met with in 
any other situation in this northern climate.  Beyond the
village of Inveresk, to the S. E., lie extensive and well cul-
tivated fields, bounded at the distance of two miles, by the 
hills of Falside and Carberry, which terminate a long fer-
tile ridge, that begins to rise 5 or 6 miles to the reastward; 
and the latter of which is the highest ground in this parish, 
being 54o feet above the level of the sea.  To the S. and
W. of the river, lie fertile fields equally well cultivated,
terminated by the extensive park and domain of Dalkeith; 
a considerable part of which, (viz, what was formerly Smea-
ton and Castle-steads), lies in this parish.

   Antiquities-The Romans did not fail to observe the
fortunate situation of the hill of Inveresk, which, though 
not more than 5o feet above the level of the sea, commands 
an extensive view, not only of the adjacent country, but of 
the spacious bason of the Frith, which is there about 18
