   Including herds, there are 59 male, and 35 female servants,
who reside in the families which they serve.  Several others
have families of their own.  The people are seemingly con-

lief of the poor.  The collection at the church from Whit-
sunday 1789 till Whitsunday 1790, amounted to L. 8: 0: 10
