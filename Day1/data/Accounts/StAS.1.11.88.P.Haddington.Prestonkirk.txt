     Statistical Account

   The advocates for political reform, consider themselves, no
doubt, to be engaged in a good cause.  But without calling
their motives in question, it may be allowed to those, who
have a deep interest in the quiet of their country and neigh-
bourhood, to deprecate the effects which their zeal in it may
produce.  Such an interest every clergyman has, both as a
citizen, and as a pastor.  Amidst the keenness of political as-
sociations, among men little qualified, either to discern with
precision, or to prosecute by proper measures, the object at
which they aim, there is danger that the voice of religion may
be disregarded, that the respect to existing laws may decay,
that the amity of neighbours may be interrupted, and that
the quiet docile character of the people may be ill exchanged,
for a spirit of discontent, jealousy, and pertinacious wrang-
ling.
