   Produce.-It is somewhat difficult to approximate very near to
the truth, in estimating the gross value of the produce of this pa-
rish, owing to the produce of the lands in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of the town being of considerably greater value than
that of those parts of the parish lying at a distance, and the great
difference in the rents of the one from the other; but the follow-
ing may be taken as being not very far from a fair estimate.
   The cultivated land is 8309 acres.  The rotations are seven,
five, and four.  Assume a five shift rotation, viz.-

<TABLE>
1/2 of 8309 acres = 1661 acres in grain crop, at L.4, 5s. per acre,  L. 7059  5  0
1/2               = 3322       in     do.     at L.4, 10s.             14949  0  0
1/2               = 1661       in 1st year's grass, at L.3, 10s         5813 10  0
1/2               = 1661       in 2d       do.      at L.1, 15s.        2406 15  0
                                                                     -------------
                                                                    L.30,228 10  0

   It has been generally held that the value of the gross produce
of land should be about equal to thrice the amount of the rental,
thus

<TABLE>
  The rental of this parish in 1837 is, as formerly stated,     L.10,136 19  8
  Maintenance and expense of labour,      -     -     -     -     10,136 19  8
  Interest of capital and profit,         -     -     -     -     10,136 19  8
                                                                ---------------
                                                                L.30,410 19  0

And the amount approximates very near to that of the value of
the gross produce ag given above.
   Quarries.-There are extensive quarries of granite in the parish.
From Stirlinghill, stones have been taken for the building of various
public works, including the Naval Docks at Sheerness, bridges, pe-
destals, the pillar at Horse Guards, Carlton Gardens, to the me-
mory of the Duke of York, &c.  Blocks of large size may be raised,
and the granite is of excellent quality, resembling, perhaps, nearer
