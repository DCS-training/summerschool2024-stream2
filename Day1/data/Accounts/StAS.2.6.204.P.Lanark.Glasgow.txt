	Glasgow, Paisley, and Ardrossan Canal.--The expense of land-
carriage from Glasgow to the west coast through the fertile coun-
ties of Renfrew, and Ayr, abounding with coal and limestone, sug-
gested a water conveyance. The operations on the canal com-
menced in May 1807, and the navigation opened between Glasgow
and Johnstone on the 4th of October 1811. Although the canal
was opened at that period, the trade did not commence till April
1812. The length of the canal from Port Eglinton to Ardrossan
is 32 3/4 miles, from Port Eglinton to Johnstone 11 miles, breadth
at top 30 feet, at bottom 18 feet, and depth 4 feet 6 inches. There
are no locks on that part of the canal yet executed, viz. between
Port Eglinton and Johnstone; but when the canal is carried for-
ward, there will be eight near Johnstone to raise the canal to the
summit level, and thirteen to fall down to the harbour of Ardros-
san. On the 6th of November 1810, passage-boats were put on
this canal; but Mr William Houston, of Johnstone Castle, has the
merit of introducing swift iron boats.
	The great increase of passengers may be seen from the follow-
ing statement.

	The passengers did not all travel from Glasgow to John-
stone, many of them leaving at intermediate stages. During the
months of July and August 1834, 50,000 persons took passages
on the canal;--the number in one day was 2500. The proportions
of the best cabin and second cabin passengers are, one-fifth of the
best cabin passengers at one penny per mile, and four-fifth of se-
cond cabin passengers at three farthings per mile. The average
total fare on the canal is therefore sixteen-twentieths of a penny
per mile. The swift boats on the Forth and Clyde, and Union
Canals, ply at similar rates.
	Union Canal.--The Union Canal was begun on the 3d of
March 1818. It is 31 1/2 miles in length from Port-Hopetoun, near
Edinburgh, to Port-Downie, near Falkirk. The navigation for
too miles west from Port-Hopetoun was opened on the 22d of
March 1822, and to Port-Downie early in May thereafter. The
