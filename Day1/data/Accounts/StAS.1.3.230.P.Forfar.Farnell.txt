hood, and no turs was afterwards allowed to be carried out
of it.  In consequence of which, fuel is a scarce commodi-
ty here; and that now used by the lower ranks is the
branches of firs, which are pruned from the woods, or
such broom and whins as the uncultivated grouns afford.
Coal are also broughrt from Arbroath, about eight miles dis-
tancem, where they are brought for 6 s. or 6 d. per boll,
(72 stone)free of any duty to government; so that they are

No peats can be had within 12 or 14 miles.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In this parish there are 60 carts
and so ploughs, 20 of which are ploughs constructed for
four horses, and 20 for two horses; so that the number of
labouring horses isn 120.  The number of black cattle is sup-
posed, at an average, to be aabout 600.  There areno sheep
kept in the parish, as there are no hills or waste ground to
supply them with pasture.  The roads were formeryl kept in
repair by the tenants, who had their labour appointed accor-
ding to the extent and value of their farms.  Last year the
statue act took place, which converts the labout into money,
at the rate of 11.4 s. Sterling for every L. 100 Scots of va-
leud rent.  There was collected last year in this parish, in-
cluding the tax on saddle and work horses, L.31 Sterling,
which is in future to be collected every year, for the purpose
of repairing the roads.  There are no manufactures car-
ried on here, all the people being employed in farming,
except a few who follow handy-craft employments, such as
taylors, wright, shoemakers, weavers, etc.  They are a so-
ber and industrious set of people, enjoying, in a reasonable
degree, the conveniencies and comforts of society, and seem-
ingly contented with their situation and circumstances.
There are no ale-houses, nor is the want of them considered
by the people as an hardship.
