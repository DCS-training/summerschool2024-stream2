     Statistical Account

   Sheep.-There are no sheep in the parish except about
1986, kept in the Braes of Doune, the moor of Lanerick,
and in Cambusmore; and even these do not thrive well.
The grounds are better adapted for black-cattle than sheep.

   Markets, Price of Provisions, etc.-There are 6 annual
fairs held in Doune, at the following terms, Martinmas,
Yoole, Candlemas, Whitsunday, Lammas, and Michaelmas.
The 2 at Michaelmas and Martinmas are large cattle mar-
kets, little inferior to the famous trysts of Falkirk.
   Provisions are cheaper here than at Stirling.  Beef at
4 1/2 d. butter 10 d. and cheese at 3 d. per l b. and eggs at 4 d.
per dozen; while in Stirling market beef is at 5 d. butter
1 s. and cheese 4 1/2 d. per l b. and eggs at 6 d. per dozen.
These articles rise and fall according to the seasons; and the
price of meal, barley, and others, is regulated by the price
of grain, as stated in the annual fiars.

   Heritors and Rent.-The valued-rent of the whole parish,
as stated in the cess-books, is L. 9163, 14 s. Scots, and yet
there are only 16 heritors, great and small.  The greatest
heritor is the earl of Moray, he being proprietor of about
one-third of the whole parish; and the other heritors valu-
ed-rent appears in a list of the whole, stated in the appen-
dix.
   The real rent at present is about L. 7500 Sterling; and
a great number of the leases being near expired, a consider-
able rise will soon take place.  The greatest advantage a
parish can enjy, is to have all the heritors residing on the
spot, because, wherever these gentlemen take up their abode,
there they spend their money.
   The only resident heritors at present are, Murdoch of
Gartincaber, Buchanan of Cambusmore, and Buchanan of
Kirkton.  The whole other heritors reside at a distance,
