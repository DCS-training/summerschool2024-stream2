parish and neighbourhood, bleached by private families, sold
at the fairs in the beginning of August, and sent to England,
where it was chiefly stamped for handkerchiefs; but for a
number of years past the demand for it has gradually de-
clined, perhaps from their making it too flight.  Still a lit-
tle coarse linen is made for the market, besides the demand
for the parish wear; and they are improving the texture of
it.  But above 45 of the weavers are now employed by the
Paisley manufacturers in the silk, besides a few in the cotton
branches.  A number of young girls are employed also by
them and the Glasgow manufacturers, in flowering and tam-
bour work.  Within these few weeks, the Jeanis have been
introduced, and will give employment to boys and girls in
spinning cotton.  There is a bleachfield in Stevenston town,
which has sufficient business from the parish and neighbour-
hood, bleaching between 8000 and 9000 yards yearly.  The
nets for the herring busses are weaved by the Saltcoats
children.

guineas yearly.  This last is a general answer to the 3 d page of
the queries, because the families of these labouring servants live
almost as well as any other common labourers.  The earnings
of their wives and children, must ever depend upon their turn
for industry.  Seldom, very seldom, is it in the power of an in.
dustrious mother of three or four young children, to earn, by
spinning even fine linen yarn, more than 1 s. 8 d. a week.  The
poor families of Highlanders in Saltcoats, can live upon much
less than the natives of the place, and seldom apply to the poor's
funds.
