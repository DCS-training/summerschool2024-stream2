	In 1780, the population had increased to 42,832; but in this
enumeration the whole of the suburbs were for the first time in-
cluded.
	In 1785, soon after the termination of the American war, the
magistrates directed the population to be ascertained; it then
amounted to 45,889.
	In 1791, the population was ascertained for Sir John Sinclair's
national statistical work. At that time, it amounted to 66,578,
including 4633, being part of the suburbs which had been omitted
in the return.
	Prior to 1801, the general results only of the different enume-
rations were preserved, but in that year a census of the inhabitants
of Great Britain was taken, for the first time, by order of Govern-
ment, when the population amounted to--males, 35,007; females,
42,378; total, 77,385. But in this enumeration, a part of the
connected suburbs, the population of which amounted to 6384,
had been omitted, and which, added to the above, made the actual
population of Glasgow at that time 83,769.
	In 1811, there was another Government enumeration of the in-
habitants of Great Britain, according to which the population of
Glasgow was as follows:--males, 45,275; females, 55,474; to-
tal, 100,749. But, in like manner, a part of the connected
suburbs, the population of which amounted to 9711, had not
been included in this enumeration, and which, added to the Go-
vernment table, made the population of the city at that period
110,460.
	In 1819, Dr Cleland, under the sanction of the public bodies,
drew up the first classified enumeration of the inhabitants of Glas-
gow, according to which, the population amounted to--males,
68,994; females, 78,203; total, 147,197.
	In 1821, there was another Government enumeration of the in-
habitants of Great Britain, when the population of Glasgow was--
males, 68,119; females, 78,924; total, 147,043.
	In 1831, there was a fourth enumeration of the inhabitants of
Great Britain, according to which, the population of Glasgow was--
males, 93,724; females, 108,702; total, 202,426.
