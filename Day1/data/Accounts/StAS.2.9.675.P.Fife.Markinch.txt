or 24 to 1-6 lea; ten frames, 400 spindles, for spinning yarn from
3 1/2 to 6 pounds per spindle, 14 to 8 lea; four frames, 160 spindles,
for spinning yarn from 10 pounds to 24 pounds per spindle, 5 to
2 lea. The principal buildings of which the mills are composed
form three sides of a rectangle, 160 feet by 140. Two of the
sides are occupied by machinery, and the third is occupied by
three spacious warehouses, with heckling rooms above. There is
a large store warehouse detached, capable of holding 200 tons of
flax, as well as large conveniences in the way of stabling smithy,
and gas-work. There are about 265 individuals eynployed at the
mills, of whom about 95 are full grown men, 120 women, and 46
of both sexes under seventeen years of age. The wages paid
each fortnight are about L.200, averaging say 12s. per week for
each man, and 5s. per week for each woman and for the younger
bands. The quantity of flax manufactured in the year 1838 was
475 tons, of which 340 tons was Baltic flax, 65 tons Archangel,
and the remaining 70 tons Duch, French, and Irish. Besides
the tows from these flaxes, about 100 tons of imported tow were
used. The total cost of the whole material was above L.25,000.
  The yarns spun are, with the exception of the heavier tow
yarns, either sold in the district adjoining, or exported to France.
The heavier tow yarns are manufactured by the proprietors into can-
vas, sacking, &c. chiefly for the London market. This branch of the
business is carried on in Dundee, and at present employs from 60
to 100 looms; but arrangements are at present making for transfer-
ring it to Balgonie; and when this is effected, it will cause an ad-
dition to the number of persons already employed of about 100
men, and 50 women and children.
  The village of Miltown, adjoining the mills, has, since the en-
largement and extension of the works in 1836-37, nearly doubled
its Population. The present population is 580. The houses are,
in general, neat, substantial, and fully beyond the average of the
country as to comfort. The rent of a house of two rooms, with a
few falls of garden ground and a pig-stye, is from L.2 to L.2, 10S.
per annum.
  Haugh Spinning-Mill was erected in the year 1794, for the
purpose of spinning chiefly canvas yarns from flax and tow, which
was carried on by, various companies up to 1832, when the pre-
sent proprietor sold all the old machinery, and introduced a com-
plete set of new, for spinning fine yarns adapted for home made li-
nens. Half the machinery works upon the long staple, and half upon
