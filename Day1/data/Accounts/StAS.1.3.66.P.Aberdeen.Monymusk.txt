     NUMBER V.

     PARISH OF MONYMUSK.

     (County of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER DUFF.

     Name.

   MONYMUSKappears to be a compound of two Gaelic
words, monaugh high or hilly, and mousick, which
signifies low and marshy ground; the nature and situation of
the country renders this conjecture more than probable, as
the parish consists, partly of farms lying along the sides of
hills, which bound it on the west and north, and of low
lands or haughs, which occupy a large space on both sides of 
the river Don.

   Situation and Extent.-This parish, which lies in the coun-
ty and synod of Aberdeen, and in the presbytery of Ga-
rioch, is seven miles long, and from four to five broad, its
figure is very irregular.  It is bounded on the east and south
by the parishes of Kemnay and Cluny, on the west by the pa-
rish of Tough, and on the north west and north by the pa-
rishes of Keig, Oyne. and Chaper-Garioch.  It is eighteen
miles difiant from Aberdeen, the nearest sea-port; the com-
munication to which is easy, by two roads, both of which
are well made and kept in good repair.
