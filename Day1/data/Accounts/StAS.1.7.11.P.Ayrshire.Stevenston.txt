day, a monument of his public spirit and enterprise.  He
built salt-pans, with all their appendages, to consume the
useless part of the coal.  By these expensive schemes, how-

able part of his estate, referring to himself the track of it

engine was erected near Saltcoats in the 1719, the second
then in Scotland.  The small cylinder of it was brought
from London, only 18 inches in diameter, not much larger
than their present pumps.  It could, therefore, raise little
water.  The work was carried on with a cautious spirit, and
moderate success, yielding a maintenance to miners, salters,
and many others employed in carrying the coals; the ship-
ping of Saltcoats increasing in the mean time gradually, but

ful push towards improvement was made.  This shall be ex-
plained immediately.  But in order to render it intelligible,
it will be necessary to attempt some description of the coal-
field, which the writer of this has been enabled to do, from
papers put into his hands by the present Robert Cunning-
hams Esq; one of the proprietors, and the sole conductor of
the work.

oval piece of ground, above four miles in length, and a male
