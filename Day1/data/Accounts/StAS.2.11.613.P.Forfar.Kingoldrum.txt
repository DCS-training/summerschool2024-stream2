yard and Catlaw, immediately north of the last-mentioned strata,
are composed of greywacke, clay-slate, and mica slate.  A bed
of blue slate is found to run through these hills; but it is not sup-
posed that it would be profitable to open it up.  Boulders of the
primitive rocks, bearing the action of water, or some hard sub-
stance, are to be found in all parts of the parish. The distribu-
tion of the ground, especially on the property of Pearsie, is highly
favourable to the glacier theory.  The numerous mounds of gra-
vel, &c. of every variety of position, size and form, are evidently
the detritus of the neighbouring hills.  These have been quoted
by Mr Lyell in confirmation of his late opinions in reference
to such deposits.  Part of the Loch of Kinnordy is in the parish,
and the marl procured from it has been much used by the farmer
for the improvement of grass lands. Peat mosses are very com-
mon.  Oak trees have been found in them of much greater size
than any that grow at the present day.  On the top of Catlaw is
a moss of considerable extent.  On the north shoulder of the
wester Schurroch, and betwixt that and the river Melgum, occurs
a bed of a variety of porcelain clay.  The soil resting on the
great conglomerate is partly of a sandy nature, partly moorish,
and partly of a mortary till. That on the trap formation is a rich
loam: this forms the best land in the parish. To the north of
the church there are about fifty acres of clay soil, lying on a bed of
moss, which has been formed by water.  The land in the north-
ern part of the parish is composed partly of black earth, intermix-
ed with a sandy soil, and some parts are very moorish.
   Botany.-The plants distributed over the parish are such as
are generally found in upland and subalpine situations. The fol-
lowing, being of local or less frequent occurrence, may be men-
