for the relief of weak cattle in stormy weather.-The land
is divided into oxen-gates, pennies, and farthings.  In the
first, there is room for 6 bolls sowing.  The arable land with-
in the parish is indeed very inconsiderable, for 162 pennies,
or 54 oxen gates, comprehend the whole.  It is found, that
every penny of land, with its proportion of hill grass, ought
to maintain 8 milch cows, with their followers of yield cattle,
that is, 3 heads, including the calf, after every milch-cow.

   Inconveniencies.-The want of roads, fuel, and wood, are
hardships with which the people struggle.  The scarcity of fuel
arises from the incessant rains, the great expence of ferrying
heavy mossy peats over arms of the sea, and of leading them
from the summit of high hills.  To all these may be added, the
want of salt:-this was never more severely felt than on the
29th of July, 1791; when the take of herring in Lochduich
was so immense, that a single boat killed 4 lasts in a night
but when this source of wealth was at the door, the parishi-
oners could find no supply, and some were necessitated to com-
mit the herrings to their original bed.-The farms which are
bases to high mountains, as in Kintail, suffer great losses from
what is called Scriddan, or "mountain torrent."  After hea-
vy rains, the summit of the hills are so impregnated, that the
mountains may be said to be in labour, till an aperture is made
by chance somewhere on their sides; the explosion which then
succeeds is loud and alarming.  Gravel and massy stones roll
together, and desolate the fields beneath.  The farm of Auch-
uirn, in Glenelchaig, once a populous town, was, in 1745,
rendered uninhabitable, and is since converted to a grazing, by
an awful Scriddan.  The traces of these eruptions have, to the
eye of a traveller, all the appearance of a military road, in the
face of the steep ascent of the mountain.
