     Statistical Account

given by Mr Smeaton in 1754, amounted only to *L. 2952.
At the foot of the parish the Nith is about one third of a
mile in breadth.  The shore is there flat and sandy, and
considerable quantities of sleech are carried from it to be
used as manure.

   Singular Rock.-About a mile eastward from the town
is a craig or rock, curionsly hollwed, known by the name
of the Maiden-bower crag.  It is said to have been famous
in the times of druidism; and may have received its name,
from being the scene of some rites practised as a test of vir-
ginity.

   Fish.-The river Nith produces salmon, trouts, sloun-
ders, pikes, cels, eels and a species somewhat larger than her-
rings, called hirlings.  The slounders are, however, taken
rather in the parish of Caerlaverock, at the mouth of the 
river.  From spring to the middle of summer, salmon are
sold in the town, at from 6 d. to 2 1/2 d. a-pount; the slounders
are sold at from 4 d. to 1 d. a-pound.  Cod from the Solway
frith have, for these three winters, been sold in Dumfries, so
low as at 1 d. or even a halfpenny a-pound.  The improve-
ment of the adjacent lands, by the quantity of lime employ-
ed, is said to have rendered the fish in the rivers less a-
bundant.  The price of salmon is now almost double what it
was 12 years ago.

   Quadrupeds.-The breed of horses has been greatly im-
proved here within these 20 years; and the black cattle are
of the well known Galloway kind.  There are few sheep,
