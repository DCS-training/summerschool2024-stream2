     of Edinburgh, etc.

     LETTER SECOND.

     Aetas parentum, pejor avis, tuht
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progenient vitisiorem.

     Quid tristes querinonie,
Si non suppluio culpa reciditur?
Quid leges sine moribus
Vane prosiciunt?

   SIR,

   I SHALL now transmit to you a few facts respecting Edin-
burgh, during the periods mentioned in my former letter,
which have a more immediate connection with MANNERS.
   A great city in modern Europe has beeb described to be
" A huge, dissipated, gluttonous, collected mass of folly and
" wickedness." Perhaps this description is applicable, more or
less, to every city, as wealth and luxury increase.-For it seems
to be a fact established by the history of mankind, that, as
opulence increase, virtue subsides.  Yet, one should not ima-
gine, a prior, that this would always be the cafe.-But it
strongly confirms the judicious observation of Horace.
   Rist modus in rebus; sunt certi denique fines,
Quos ultra, citraque requit consistere rectum.
   All nations are at first poor, and their manners simple.  As
they advance to industry and commerce, to a certain degree;
they become improved,and enlightened; but opulence intro-
duces indolence, sensuality, vice, and corruption, and they
then hasten to decay.  In all matters of public or private life
the proper umdus in rebus, is the distinguishing test of good sense.
