     Statistical Account

in the parish of Abbotshall, about 100 in the parish of Dy-
sart, about 60 in the parish of Largo, and the rest scattered
over the neighbouring parishes.  The annual amount of a
weaver's work (allowing for the variations of age, ability, and
habits of application, among the whole weavers employed) is
found to be at a medium from 10 to 12 pieces, measuring
one with another, about 110 yards.  On this computation,
the annual produce of a loom runs from 1100 to 1320 yards,
worth on the lowest estimate of yards, and at the average
price of 1 s. each*, L 55: And the annual produce of the
whole looms employed amounts, on the same estimate, nearly
to 900,000 yards+, worth at the same average about L. 45,000.
Reckoning 22 spindles as the average quantity of yarn to
a piece, 178,200 spindles are annually manufactured into
cloth.  Of this quantity about a ninth part is cotton yarn
which is spun here, and in the neighbourhood, with the as-
sistance of machinery; as mentioned formerly.  The flax-yarn
has hitherto been spun with the hand++.  After the flax is
heckled, the manufacturer sends it to undertakers in different
parts of the country, who give it out to be spun, and receive
a certain commission on the quantity of yarn returned by them.
The expence of spinning, when commission and carriage are
included, amounts at an average to 1 s. 3 d. the spindle.  Be-

*The prices of checks run from 6 d. to 1 s. 6 d. per yard; of ticks, from 7 d.
to 2 s. 6 d.  The proportion of plain linen is very inconsiderable, perhaps not
the whole, and the price is low.  As the cheaper fabrics pre-
vail, a low average is taken.
+This is nearly as 1 to 5 1/2 of the whole linen made in the county of Fife,
the amount of which for the year ending the 1st, November 1793, was
5,013,089 yards.
++ A mill for spinning flax, on the Darlington model, is erecting in the neigh-
bourhood by a manufacturer of this place; from which specimens of good
work have already been produced.
