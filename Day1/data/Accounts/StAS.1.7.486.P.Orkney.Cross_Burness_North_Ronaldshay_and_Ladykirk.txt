afford the time and expence, go over to the isle of Eday,
which lies half a league south-west of Sanday, and there cut
and dry some peats, for which privilege they pay to the pro-
prietor 1 s. per ton of dry peats.  All other expences added,
they will cost 5 s. a ton when brought over.  Cottagers sel-
dom have above one or two tons.  The greater farmers have
from 30 to 80 or 100 tons.  It is thought that coals from
Newcastle, freight and duty included, would be as cheap, or

of a cottager or labourer, or their weekly expences.  The
annual earnings of a cottager may be stated as under.  There

He has as his fee for the above 7 months, from
  the 11th November to the 11th June, about 2
  acres arable ground, free of rent, and the farmer   
  whom he serves tills it.  The produce of this
  may be, after reserving seed, in tolerable crops,
  about 5 or 6 bolls bear, and 4 or 4 1/2 bolls oats.
  The oats will yield only about 2 1/2 bolls meal,
