hall.-The late Sir George Munro was the first, in this
part of the country, who began improvements in agri-
culture on a large scale, by enclosing, planting, drain-
ing, liming, fallowing, and sowing green crops on his
mains of Poynterfield, which now add greatly to the
beauty and value of that part of the estate; and very
great improvements have been carried on in all these
respects, on the mainses of Braclangwell and Newhall;
and these 3 contiguous seats, in full view of the noble
bay and harbour of Cromarty, form as beautiful a land-

in this parish have been much improved of late, and are

riages, will be as seriously attended to, as oads and bridges, especially at
the ferries of Invergordon and Fort-George.
