rage proportion of individuals to a family is 41/2. The number of
inhabited houses is 263; in other words, the, average of individuals
to a house is 7 38/863. This great proportion is owing to the cir-
cumstance that several of the houses in Gatehouse having com-
mon stairs, or at least a common entrance, are tenanted by more
than one family ; in some few instances by three or four. The
following table shows the relative proportion of births, marriages,
and deaths, for the three years ending in 1839:

<TABLE>
	   Years.     Births.  Marriages.  Deaths.
	   1837,        58          9        50
	   1838,        56          7        44
	   1839,        44         17        25
	By taking the average of these three years, we find that the
births are about 1 to every 36 of the population; the marriages
1 to every 170; and the deaths, I to every 48; the proportion
of births being greater than the average of England and Wales;
of marriages, less; and of deaths, less; a good proof of the sa-
lubrity of the climate, and the prudence of the people in their
formation of marriage connections, as also of the physical com-
forts which they enjoy. (Second Annual Report of the Registrar-
General. London, 1840.) But no perfectly sound conclusion,
we confess, can be drawn from so limited a population as that of
Girthon, particularly when embracing so short a space as three
years.

	The excess of females as compared to males, is 150. The
number of tradesmen in the parish is 105, exclusive of appren-
tices; of labourers in Gatehouse, 56; while the whole rural po-
pulation, with the exception of the farmers, may be considered as-
labourers. The number of illegitimate births within the last three
years is 15, or, on an average, 5 annually; but some of the cases,
though registered in the session book, do not actually belong to
the parish.
	Character of the People.--There are no customs, games, or
amusements peculiar to this parish. The belief in witches, fairies,
brownies, dreams, and other superstitions, once universal in Gal-
loway, has not been entirely laid aside; particularly on the part
of the older and more remote inhabitants. The houses of the
people, particularly those of the farmers, are, in general, good
and substantial. All classes enjoy, in, a reasonable degree, the
