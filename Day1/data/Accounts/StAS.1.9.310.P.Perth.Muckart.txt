or of a circular form like cauldrons.  One of these is
much larger than the rest, over which the rock on the south
side of the river is a little projected.  In this cavity or
cauldron, the water seems as if it were always boiling
round, having a thick brown or yellow scum on the top,
owing to its great agitation, bearing a striking resemblance
to the working of malt liquor in a large brewing vessel.
From this the name of Cauldron Linn is taken.  A little
farther down is the second and great cascade, where the ri-
ver hath worn its way through the rock, and when there is
no flood in the water, it runs below a beautiful arch of so-
lid rock; but this arch must in time be carried away by
the violence of the current, or be undermined by the wear-
ing of the water.  The height of this fall to the surface of
the water, where it drops, is about 44 feet; and the height
from the top of the fall to the top of the rocks is about 44
feet; so that the whole height of the rocks from the top
to the surface of the water below the fall, is about 88 feet.
Below this cascade the rocks widen considerably, and in
the clifts on the face of them, the daws and hawks build
their nests.  Beneath the rocks there is a steep brae on
both sides, covered with trees and bushes, through which
there is a foot-path to the edge of the river, from which
there is an excellent view of the great cascade.

   Coal and Lime.-There are both coal and lime in diffe-
rent parts of the parish; but for some time past, neither of
these hath been wrought to great extent.  The whole coal
in the parish belongs to the Duke of Argyle, who, as su-
perior, has a privilege of working coal in any part of the
feuars lands, upon his pay ing surface damages.  This pri-
vilege, and also the lime rock in the lands of Muckart
mill, belonging to his Grace, are let to a Company, who
are only working the lime at present, for which they have
much greater demands than they are able to answer.  The
