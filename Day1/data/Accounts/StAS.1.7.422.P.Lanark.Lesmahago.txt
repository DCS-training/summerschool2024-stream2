lands.  Upon the whole, the soil of the parish is far from
being of the most fertile quality, and is better adapted to
pasturage than tillage.  Here it deserves to be remarked, that
tillage has been pursued to a much greater extent, at some
former period, than at present; for there are every where to
be found, even almost to the summits of the highest moun-
tains, large tracts of land, which have been regularly formed
into ridges, and smoothed by repeated culture, now over-
grown with bent, heath, and mosses.  How it comes to pass,
that land on which corn would not now ripen, should have
been attentively cultivated some centuries ago, is left to the
curious to enquire; for there is no tradition to be traced
here, which would serve to throw any light upon the subject*.
   The most remarkable mountains are the great range which
separates this parish from those of Douglas and Muirkirk,
called the Cumberheadhills, the Knotberrylaw, the Warlaw,
the Todlaw, the Birkenhead, and the Graystonehill, on the
west side; the Blackhill, the Dullars, and the Boreland, to-

divides this parish from Muirkirk; and running eastward for
6 miles joins the Nethan, which has its source in the same
mountains, a few miles to the east.  The joint stream, which
then takes the name of Nethan, runs north and east through
the parish, dividing it nearly into two equal halves, and falls
into the Clyde a little above where the parishes of Dalserf

*It also appears, that this part of the country is less fertile
than formerly, by an old charter belonging to the monastery,
which mentions a considerable quantity of wheat, payable from
the neighbouring lands.  Few people now attempt to cultivate
wheat on these lands; and such as have tried it have abandoned
it from ill success.
