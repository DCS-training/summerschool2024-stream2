   Antiquities.- Of these we cannot boast: that we have many.
There seems to have been a camp a little S. from the village
of Carnock, upon an eminence, which still retains the name
of Camps; and probably another, in some remote period, up-
on Corneil-hill.  Both seem well adapted for that purpose;
the ascent being steep and difficult upon two sides at least,
and the prospect of the adjacent country noble and extensive
from the summits.  Upon opening a cairn upon Carneil-hill,
about 20 years ago, there was found an urn of earthen ware,
containing some small copper coins, but they had no inscrip-
tion which could be read by those into whose hands they
came, There are evidently the remains of a camp (probably
one of the Roman Castra Stativa), upon Craig-Luscar Hill, in
the parish of Dunfermline, adjoining to the N.E. boundary
of ours.-We have no barrows or tumuli, certainly known as
artificial.  There are indeed some Knows, or Small eminences,
as the Knows of Luscar, and the Law Know adjoining to Car-
nock.  From the name of the last of these, we may be led to
believe, that it was a place for assembling the vassals and de-
pendants round their superiors, in the days of the feudal sys-
tem, that differences might be decided and justice administer-
ed.  Several of the hamlets preserve some traces of those dis-
tracted times in the names they bear, as they seem to indi-
cate war, confusion, and noise.-Among the antiquities of
Carnock may also be mentioned an ancient cross, in the
middle of the northern division of the village.  This crofs is
of a circular form, containing six rounds of stone steps, rising
one above another, and gradually diminishing in diameter as
they ascend.  In the middle grows a venerable thorn tree,
