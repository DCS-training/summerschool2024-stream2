the great number of ships that frequent the river, is much
wanted, and which it is supposed could be obtained at a mo-

   In Newburgh are 6 or 7 ale-houses; chiefly frequented by
sailors, smugglers, and fishermen.  In the country part of the

   Rent, Agriculture, etc.-There are about 50 farms in the
parish,; some of them large, extending from 200 to 1200 a-

few from L. 15 to L. 20, converting the victual-rent at
