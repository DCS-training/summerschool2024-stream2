<FOOTNOTE>

*These articles, relating to the value of oat-meal, are taken from the re-
cords of the University of Glasgow.  It merits particular notice, that though
oat-meal has risen in price a good deal, yet it has not risen in proportion to
other articles of provision.  This, it is apprehended, may be ascribed to the
following causes:  1 The price of oat-meal has been prevented from rising
as high as it would naturally do, by acts of Parliament, allowing the im-
portation of oats and oat-meal from other countries, when they exceed a
certain rate.  2. The demand for oat-meal is lessened by the increasing de-
mand for other kinds of provision;  such as butcher meat, flour, various
kinds of vegetables and roots, but especially potatoes, which may be laid,
without exaggeration, to supply the inhabitants of this country with food
for three or four months annually.  It may be thought, that the price of
oat-meal is hindered from rising in proportion to other kinds of provision,
by the greater quantity of oats now raised, in consequence of the late im-
provements in agriculture.  But, whether the quantity of oats now raised,
be much greater than formerly,  may be questioned.  It is certain, that in
consequence of a better system of agriculture, much heavier crops of oats are
raised upon the land in tillage; but it is equally certain, that there is much
less land in tillage, and that there are many thousands of acres now in
wheat, potatoes, hay and pasture, which were formerly in oats.  Some good
judges are of opinion, that the quantity of oats now raised, is not much
greater than it was 40 years ago; and that the principal cause of the rise in
the price of oat-meal since that time, is the very great quantity of oats now
consumed in feeding horses.
