of births, baptisms and marriages are intermingled with accounts
of the money collected at the church door on Sundays, and state-
ments of the expenditure in behalf of the poor, together with the
minutes of the proceedings of the kirk-session in matters of disci-
pline.
   The older documents are so confused and unsatisfactory, and
some of them in such a state of decay, that the kirk-session have
ordered the whole to be transcribed by the parochial teacher, Mr
Galloway, whose accuracy and intelligence are a security for the task
being properly executed.  Had the more ancient records been
preserved, we might have found some details on the subject of
witchcraft. *

<FOOTNOTE>An account of the Confession and Death of John Reid, smith in Inchinnan, who made
a discovery conform to the former witnesses after the trial was over.-Upon the 21st of
May 1697, after the trial of the seven witches, there is an attestation subscribed by
Mr Patrick Simpson, minister at Renfrew, Walter Scott, bailie there, &c. of this
import.  John Reid, Smith in Inchinnan, prisoner, did in presence of the said persons
and some others, declare, that about a year ago the devil (whom he knew to be such
thereafter) appeared to him when he was travelling in the night time, but spoke none
to him at the first encounter.  At the second appearance he gave him a bite or nip
in his loin, which he found painful for a fortnight.  That the third time he appeared
to him as a black man, and desired him to engage in his service, upon assurance of
getting gear and comfort in the world, since he should not want any thing that he
would ask in the devil's name: and then he renounced his baptism, putting the one
hand to the crown of his head, and the other to the sole of his foot, thereby giving
himself up to Satan's service, after which the pain of the bite or nip ceased.  He told
that hitherto there were no others present; but thereafter he was at several meetings
particularly that in Bargarran's yard, about the time when there was a fast for Chris-
tian Shaw; where the devil appeared in the same kind of garb as he first appeared
to him, and they consulted Christian's death, either by worrying or drowning her in
the well, and the devil said, he should warrant them, that they should neither be
heard, seen, nor confess; to which end he gave every one of them a bit of flesh; that
the declarant got, but let it fall and did not eat it.  Thereafter, in the presence of the
laird of Jordanhill, the minister, Mr Andrew Cochrane, town-clerk, and Bailie Pater-
son, he owned his former confessions: and being enquired of Jordanhill how they
were advertised of their meetings, he said that ordinarily at their meetings the time
of the next was appointed; but for particular warning there appeared a black dog
with a chain about his neck, who tinkling it, they were to follow, &c.  And being
enquired by the minister, if he did now wholly renounce the devil (for he bad for-
merly told how Satan had not performed his promise) and give himself to Jesus
Christ, and desire to find mercy of God through him : he assented thereunto.  It is
to be observed that John Reid, after his confession, had called out of the prison win-
dow, desiring Bailie Scott to keep that old body Angus Forrester, who had been his
fellow prisoner, close and secure; whereupon the company asked John, when they
were leaving him, on Friday's night the 21st of May, whether he desired company
or would be afraid alone ; he said he had not fear of any thing.  So being left till Sa-
turday's forenoon, he was found in this posture, viz. sitting upon a stool, which was
on the hearth of the chimney, with his feet on the floor and his body straight upward,
his shoulders touching the lintel of the chimney, but his neck tied with his own neck-
cloth (whereof the knot was behind) to a small stick thrust into a clift above the lin-
tel of the chimney; upon which the company, especially John Campbell, a surgeon,
who was called, thought at first, in respect of his being in an ordinary posture of sit-
ting, and the neckcjoth not having any run loup, but an ordinary knot, which was
not very strait, and the stick not having the strength to bear the weight of his body
or the struggle, that he had not been quite dead; but finding it otherwise, and that
he was in such a situation, that he could not have been the actor thereof himself, con-
cluded that some extraordinary cause had done it, especially, considering that the
