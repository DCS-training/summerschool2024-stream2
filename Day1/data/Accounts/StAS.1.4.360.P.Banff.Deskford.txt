trials, his Lordship was discouraged,  The bleak situation,
the bad exposure, the wetness of soil, owing to a pan be-
neath it, prevented the crops from filling and ripening.
The inclosure are now let annually for pasture,  The
hedges, by great care and attention, thrive in some places;
but the planting in the belts does not promise to succeed.
The present Earl of Findlater, about 10 years ago, made
trial of the larix fir in one of the inclosures to N. E.  It
thrives at present, and gives encouragement to proceed in
planting under its shelter.  Upon the W. side of the strath,
is a hill called Old More, which affords, at a moderate di-
stance, a plentiful supply of exellent peat and turf.  The
late Earl of Findlater parcelled out the skirts of this
hill into small lots, and let them at a low rent; but the
people are poor, and their improvements not substan-
tial.

   Soil and Produce.-The soil, along the lower parts of the
Strath, is generally a loam, with a bottom of a strong deep
clay, and produces wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, and good
crops of hay.  Towards the hills, it is a light black soil,
and under it, an obstinate pan.  Owing to this pan, in some
places, and the clay bottom in others, the fields retain the
rains long; which circumstance retards the labour in the
spring, and renders the crops late, especially in rainy seasons.
In favourable seasons, the tenants sell considerable quantities
of barley and oats to merchants in Portfoy, who export
them generally to the south frith.  In the parish, there
are spots of moorish and waste ground, which might be im-
proved to advantage.  One of considerable extent adjoin-
ing to a farm has been lately trenched and drained, at the
expence of the heritor.  This is a substantial and advan-
tageous mode of improvement.  It not only gives bread
