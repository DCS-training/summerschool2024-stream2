enemies, the English.  There is also some planting about it
of a later date.  Lord Douglas, upwards of 20 years ago,
planted about 300 acres:  and within these last 10 or 11 years,
above 800 acres more, with oaks, elms, beech, planes, ashes,
and firs of different kinds; which in a few years will have a
fine effect to beautify and shelter this part of the country.
Some hundred acres more are yet to be planted to complete
the plan.  The most considerable river in the parish is Dou-
glas, which takes its rise at the foot of Cairn Table, 9 miles
above the town, and runs into the Clyde about 7 miles below
it.  There are 3 smaller waters in the upper part of the pa-
rish, which all run into Douglas; namely, Glespine, Kinnocks,
and Monks.  All these waters abound with excellent trout;
and in some parts of the water of Douglas there are very fine
pike.

   Minerals.-This parish abounds in coal, which will be in-
exhaustible for many centuries.  There are many different
seams from 2 to 7 feet in height.  The decline of the mine-
rals is various.  At the march with the parish of Carmichael,
about 1 of 3; 1/2 a mile to the westward, 1 of 2; and a little
more west, 1 of 1 1/2.  The stretch of the coal is nearly paral-
lel to the course of the river, which runs from S. W. to N.
E.  The most remarkable circumstance, that attends there
coals, is, their being intersected with a great number of steps,
which throw the coal down from 30 to 50 feet perpendicular.
These steps are from 60 to 200 yards separate, and lie nearly
parallel.  They cross the stretch of the coals in a direction
nearly west.  Coal is the principal fuel here.  As one tacks-
man rents the coal both in this estate, and in the estate of
Carmichael, the property of the Earl of Hyndford (through
which estate the same seams of coal stretch), the demand from
either of the works is very irregular and uncertain, being re-
