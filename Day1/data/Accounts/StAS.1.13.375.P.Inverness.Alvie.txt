     NUMBER XXVI.

     PARISH or ALVIE,

     (COUNTY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MURRAY, PRESBY-
     TERY OF ABERNETHY.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN GORDON.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

   ALVIE, in some old charters called Alloway, is pro-
bably derived from the Gaelic Alleibh, i.e. "Cold
"Island," the place being formed into a peninsula by a
lake; within the neck is the kirk, manse, and nearly all
the glebe, a delightful situation in summer, but extremely
cold in winter, within 1/2 mile of the high road.  All the
names of places here are Gaelic, and descriptive of their lo-
cal situation.  The parish lies in the district of Inverness-
shire called Badenoch (bushy), from its being interspersed
with bushes of wood.  Its form is irregular.  The princi-
pal inhabited division lies along the river Spey, on the N.
side, between N. E. and S. W. 10 miles long, and from
1 to 2 miles broad, through which runs the great road
leading from Inverness, Fort George, etc. to Edinburgh.
