winter.  He has liberty to cast turf for himself, and sometimes
a few peats.  He works to the farmers in harvest, attends
the plough during winter and spring, at which time he ei-
ther receives his victuals in the farmer's house, or has al-
lowed him 2 pecks of oat-meal a-week.  What time he
has to spare in summer, from Whitsunday to harvest, he
works for day's wages to different persons.  His wife and
children weave stockings, as above mentioned, until the
boys are fit for herding cattle.  What is thus earned, if he
and his wife are industrious, and his family keep in health,
maintains them in a sober way.  Oat-meal, cabbages,
greens, potatoes, whey, and sometimes part of the milk of
his cow, are their daily fare.  Beer or ale they can seldom

his small croft, it is sometimes taken from him.  He pos-
sesses it only from year to year, and is therefore obliged to
remove from place to place.

the barley at 12 s. and the glebe at the common rent of

1600, was partly rebuilt in 1760, and received a partial re-
paration in 1786, but is by far too small for the accommo-
dation of the parish.  A new manse was built in 1759,
and was considerably enlarged and repaired in 1781.  A
new school-house was erected in 1786.-The schoolmaster's
salary is L. II Sterling.  There are generally from 30 to
40 scholars, and at present 11 boarders, at 13 guineas a-
year, for board and education.-The number of poor is
from 20 to 22.  None of them go about as beggars, but
we have a considerable number of such from Aberdeen and
neighbouring places.  The annual amount of the funds for
