     Statistical Account

tiquarians are of opinion, that the original names of many
parishes, towns, and places, have been changed; and, in
compliment to Popish saints, as already mentioned, modern-
ised, in different parts of the Highlands.  As this parish,
therefore, is chiefly situated on the banks of the river of Helms-
dale, and the inhabitants dwell near it on both sides, the
name Kildonan does not seem to have been its original name,
but substituted for it.  The river of Helmsdale, which passes
through the Strath, is called Abhin Iligh: the Strath, more
frequently, if not altogether, called Strath Iligh, and the Gae-
lie name of Helmsdale, in the country language, is called
Bun Iligh, that is, the mouth or lower part of the water,
where it issues into the Moray Frith.  If, then, the name of
the parish has been changed from Iligh to Kildonan, as a few
have called it Scir Iligh, the parish of Iligh or Ilie must be
the original name and designation; and indeed this is ren-
dered still more probable, by the Roman geographers, who
place the river Ilie in this neighbourhood, which must evi-
dently have been the Helmsdale.

   Extent, Rivers, and Lakes.-The appearances of the parish
is mountainous, extending on both sides of the river of Helms-
dale, for the space of 13 miles; and 7 miles beyond that,
at the farthest extremely of the parish, the inhabitants are
situated along both sides of 6 lochs or lakes, which are the
general source of the river.  The length of the parish is
computed to be 20 miles, and only 8 miles broad in one end,
and scarcely a quarter of a mile in the other.  It resembles
the form of a tree, stretching out at the top, or height of
the parish, into branches.  These branches, which are thus
formed, are the districts of Strathtilney, Frigh, and Strath-
beg, whose respective small rivulets run into the river of
