more advantageous modes of farming having been introdu-
ced.  Black cattle are more numerous, being at present no
sewer than 534; and even these are only the winter stock,
kept for labour, and for breeding.  In summer, many fields
are rented by strangers for grazing cattle, which they intro-
duce from different places; and even the farmers of the pa-
rish purchase additional stock, when the grass springs up.
These are again sold off, as the year advances.  Until Janua-

turnips, which are then also driven to Aberdeen, and there
sold.  Horses are less numerous than they would be, if the
practice of plowing with oxen did not prevail.  Of these,
however, there are in the parish 87.  At few swine are sed
here; but the greater part are annually fatterned, and killed
in December of January.  In the beginning of spring 1791,
there were 39 bee-hives, in the parish, which would, no
doubt, produce many additional swarms in the course of the
summer.

   Agriculture.-Agrigulture has been gradually improved to
a state of considerable perfection.  Grass seeds had not been
sown in this parish, in any considerable quantity, before the
year 1750; still about that time they were not kept for sale
by the merchants in Aberdeen, and consequently could not
be much known among our farmers.  The culture of tur-
nips was equally unknown at the settlement of the present in-
cumbent.  A few only were raised by some gentlemen in
their gardens, for kitchen use.  In the year 1758, the mini-

he had sown in his garden, and which he did not expect to
succeed well, tore out the greater part with a hoe, leaving
only a few scattered here and there upon the bed; but was
much surprised, to find his crop of turnips turn out much
