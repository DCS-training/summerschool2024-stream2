     of Tongue.

John of Lochaber's Bed, whither he is said to have retired
in times of danger.  A family of the Mackays are descend-
ed from him, and are reported still to have in their possession
his banner, with this motto, wrought in golden letters, Biodh
taun, Biodh treun, i. e. Be valiant.

   Islands.-The principal islands on the coast are, Ealan no
Coomb, or Ealan na Navimph, i. e. the Island of Saints, Ealan
nan Roan, or the Island of Seals, and the Rabbit Island.
Ealan na Coomb had formerly a chapel and burial place in ti,
the traces of which are still to be seen.  On the south side
of the island, the sea, after passing for several yards through
a narrow channel, spouts up into the air sometimes to the
height of 30 feet, through a hole in a rock, which in shape
and size is like the moon at full, and a few reconds after-
wards, there is a discharge of water from the east side of the
island, with a noise and appearance resembling the explosion
of a cannon.  This happens only when it is half flood, and
a smart gale at north-west.  Ealan na Roan is about 2 miles
in circumference, and is inhabited by 4 families, consisting of
36 persons.  It is formed of a mixture of sand, and a red-
dish kind of pebble, which appear as if baked together.
About 7 years ago, part of the ground near the middle of
this island, sunk in without any visible cause; and, to use
Milton's words,

     'left i' th' midst a horrid vale?

   The Rabbit Island, which lies in the entrance of Tongue
Bay, abounds in rabbits.  It was formerly called Ealan a
Ghail, from a combat (tradition says) sought upon it, between
one Gaul and Torquil, in which Gaul obtained the victory;
