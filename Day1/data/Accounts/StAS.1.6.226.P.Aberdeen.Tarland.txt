these hills, when they came from the uncivilized parts of
Lochaber, etc. for the sake of plundering cattle, declared them
to be the coldest: hills in Scotland; and the assertion appears
to be not ill-sounded.

   Surface, Soi1, and Climate.-The lands about the village of
Tarland are mostly flat and level; a great part of them is liable to
be overflown with water.  There is a level between Tarland
and Coul 2 English miles in length, and from 1/4 to 3/4 in
breadth, where it is said there is not six feet of descent from
the one end to the other.  In September 1768, the whole of
this level was under water.  The soil in this level is general-
ly good and fertile: the other parts of the parish are more un-
even, and the soil various; tho' the whole would be capable of
great improvement, if proper means were within reach, but
these are wanting.  The tenants are not able to inclose; lime
is not to be got, but at an expence which they cannot afford;
there is no command of water in most places where it would
be most useful.  The same things may be said of the lands in
that part of the parish of Migvy, which lies in Cromar: the
soil on Deskry side is generally thin, and the crops often late,
and liable to be hurt by frosts and mildews.  The country is
mountainous and cold.  Over the whole of both parishes the
air is dry and healthy; and, among the inhabitants, there are
no distempers peculiar to the climate.  Nervous and rheuma-
tic complaints are more common than they were 30 or 40 years
ago; owing in part, at least, to the different mode of living,
which is more generous, and to the use of spirituous liquors a-
mong the males, and of tea among the females; both of which
are drunk in much greater quantities now, than in the days of
our fathers.
