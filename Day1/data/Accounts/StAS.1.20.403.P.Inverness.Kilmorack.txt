names to as many glens; these rivers intersect the parish in
different directions, at their conflux below Erkless Castle,
the seat of Mr Chisholm of Chisholm; they form the Beau-
ly, which runs about eight miles before it discharges itself
into the Frith of that name, at the most easterly point of the
parish.  This river, from the Frith to Beaufort Castle,
abounds in salmon, and the harvest floods sometimes enable
a few to get over the Falls of Kilmorack, and then they can
with ease swim upwards more than 20 miles, even to the
head of the Farrur, and a great way up the Glass; but this
seldom happens, and the number is commonly so trisling,
that the proprietor very properly thinks, the value would
not indemnify the expence and trouble that would attend
the killing of them.  A little below the Falls of Kilmo-
rack is a stream reckoned among the best in Scotland for
angling salmon; from 20 to 30 have oftern been taken by
one person in the course of a day.
   The late Lord Lovat, who, with pleasure, often visited
these Falls, once made a very uncommon and surprising ex-
periment.  Alongside on of them he ordered a kettle full of
water to be placed over a fire, and a few minutes after, a
large salmon leaped into it.  Fabulous and incredible as this
may seem to those who never were at Kilmorack, it is what
would undoubtedly happen a hundred times every season,
were the experiment tried.  In the months of July and Au-
gust, many fish lie at the foot of these Falls; when a 
flood comes they all endeavour to get up the river, but as
the water in which they swim is constantly agitated and
frothy, on account of the height from which it falls, they
cannot see before them, often mistake their direction, and
leap on the dry rock.  It is therfore a common practice
with the people in the neighbourhood, to lay branches of
trees along the side of the stream, to prevent the fish tum-
bling back into the river.  Twenty salmon, by these means,
