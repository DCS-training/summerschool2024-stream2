     Daft lassie, when we're naked, what'll ye say,
     Gif our twa herds come brattling down the brae,
     And fee us sae?-

Between the house and the little haugh, where the Esk and
the rivulets from the Harbour Craig meet, are some roman-
tic grey craggs at the side of the water, looking up a turn in
the glen, and directly fronting the south.  Their crevices are
filled with birches, shrubs, and copsewood; the clear stream
purles its way past, within a few yards, before it runs directly
under them, and projecting beyond their bases, they give
compleat beild to whatever is beneath and form the most
inviting retreat imaginable.  Farther up, the glen widens im-

holm, with the hanging burn, now more quiet, winding
among peebles, in short turns through it.  At the head of
this howm, on the edge of the stream, with an aged thorn
behind them, are the ruins of an old washing house; and
the place was so well calculated for the use it had formerly
been applied to, that another more convenient one was built
about twenty years ago, and is still to be seen.  Still farther
up the burn, agreeable to the description in the dialogue of
the second scene, the hollow beyond Mary's Bower, where
the Esk divides it in the middle; and forms a linn or leap, is
named the How Burn; a small inclosime above is called the
Braehead park; and the hollow below the cascade, with its
bathing pool, and little green, its birches, wild shrubs, and
variety of natural flowers in summer, with its rocks, and

designed, no doubt, to distinguish it from the upper division
of the How, either for the take of the verse, and the allite-
ration or initial resemblance, or which is more likely, because
some cottager of that name, in other parts of the poem called
