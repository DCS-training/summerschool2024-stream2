mount at present to about 330 L.  But upon the expiration
of the present leases of land, they will rise considerably above
that sum.  Out of this fund the burgh pays about 100 L. to
the public teachers.  They are not much in debt, and what
they owe arises from the lands they have lately purchased.  Had
they bought more property at an earlier period, they would
have considerably augmented the revenues of the community.
However, though they have made but few purchases, it does
not appear, that they have alienated any property for a great
many years past.  Considerable sums have been laid out in
public buildings, particularly upon a large and elegant court
house, which they built about 3 years ago, for the accommoda-
tion of the courts of justice, and public meetings of the stew
artry.  It cost above 600 L.

   Cess.-In calculating the annual supply, which is generally
done in April, we cannot avoid remarking a piece of injustice
in the mode of assessing a certain class of the inhabitants.
The supply, which is about 40 L. Sterling yearly, is levied,
one half from burgh lands, and from merchants and trades-
men for their respective trades; the other half is thrown en-
tirely upon the tenants of houses, while no part is charged to
the account of those who possess and occupy houses as their
own property.  Such an egregious deviation from all the
rules of justice and equity, is perhaps not to be parallelled in
any burgh in the kingdom.  But it is to be hoped, such an
unequal taxation, where one description of persons (and those
by no means the poorest), is totally exempted, and another
burdened with the whole sum, will soon be rectified.

   Trade.-The town of Kirkcudbright had long ago a consi-
derable inland trade, and a good share of commerce.  No town
was better situated for it.  How it came to lose it in a later
