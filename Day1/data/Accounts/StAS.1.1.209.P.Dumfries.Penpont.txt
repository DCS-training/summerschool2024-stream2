would be disposed to bring all their wool to it without any
advance on the price.  This parish produces annually for sale
above 1500 stones heavy weight, that is 24 lbs English each;
and 10,000 might be found in the circle, besides some finer
wool, at no great distance, for particular uses.  Wool has been
sold these two last years at 3 s. 6 d. the stone, and for the six
preceding years considerably cheaper.  The late demand from
England raised the price.

   Antiquities.-An old Roman causeway runs through Tyn-
ron close to the edge of the Scar.  There are 2 moats of earth,
1 oblisk, and 4 very large cairns.  The vestiges of Tiber's castle,
which has been a large building, are to be seen on the banks
of the Nith.  A small part of the wall next the river remains.
Fossae are visible, and some entrenchments where it was
most accessible.  It is supposed that the barony of Tiber is
named from Tyber, or Tiberius.  There is a Roman en-
campment too.  The English had a garrison in this castle in
the time of Sir William Wallace, who took it by surprise.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-White and red free stone, and
whitish grey with red pecks, abound in the lower part of
the parish.  There os calmstone, and plenty of ruddle.  Blue
grey, and brownish whin, are very abundant.  Arches of bridges
are built with whin.  Water stone is a blue grey, dresses neatly,
and is used in building.  There are some rocks composed of
spar, whin, and lime stone.  Large transparent white stones are
found at the head of Glenmannaburn.  There are some mineral
springs, but of little note, impregnated with iron.  Marle is
found in several bogs.  There are indications of lead, iron, and
coal.  At present, coal is bought from Sanquhar, at the distance
of 14 miles.  At the pit, 8 cwt. costs 10 1/2 d. and sells here at
