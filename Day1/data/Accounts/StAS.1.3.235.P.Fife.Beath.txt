mill, lately erected on a new construction, which is drawn
by a single horse without water, and serves for a barley mill
at the same time:  this is considered as a great improvement
in this part of the country.  Loch Tilly is a small lake, or
piece of water, which separates Beath from Dunfermline, and
abounds with pikes and perches.

   Curiosities.-The greatest curiosity in the parish is the hill
of Beath, the south west part of which which affords a most
delightful and extensive prospect of the Frith of Forth,
the three Lothians, and many of the neighbouring counties;
it is covered with a beautiful green sward, and affords excel-
lent sheep pasture.  From the top, there is certainly one of
the finest landscapes in Scotland.  This hill is frequently 
visited by strangers, for the fake of the extent and beauty of
the prospect.

   School.-The parochial school is the only one in the parish:
the salary is 100 merks Scots.  The number of scholars is
about 30; the living altogether does not exceed L. 15 or
L. 16 a year.
