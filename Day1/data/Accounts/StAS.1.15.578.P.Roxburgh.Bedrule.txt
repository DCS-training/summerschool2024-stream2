in this respect, and their hearty disapprobation thereof; and
some of the people thus circumstanced, even go the length
to give it as the reason for their remaining at home in bad

is no matter, if it has been tolerated by law, of what sect or description?
Would this not cut down, at one stroke, the pious funds of all the Dissenters,
together with the remaining part of the patrimony of the church, still reser-
ved by the Legislature to be applied according to its original intention, for
the support of national religion, i. e. public worship and instruction?  The Esta-
blished Clergy of Scotland, as was said, being, by law, most strictly bound to
reside, none of them, therefore, are capable of holding pluralities, or any li-
ving, in commendam, by which means, independent of the suitableness of this
salutary regulation, the money they receive in stipend, etc. as was also men-
tioned, is necessarily circulated in the parishes and nearest market towns to
where it is raised, by which means the people have not only immediately the
benefit of their instruction, advice, and friendship, but also, mediately, of the
stipends they receive, by their being expended amongst them.  By the law of
Scotland, also, the poor of every description or sect whatever, without excep-
tion, in each landward parish, have a legal title to call upon the established
minister, and he is bound, if the heritors and tenants do not duly assess them-
selves in what is reasonable for their maintenance, upon proper information,
to report to the Judge Ordinary, what appears so to him, and aid the may
be otherwise altogether helpless, and thereby prevent what might, in some
cases, perhaps, prove a fatal delay.  For the minister is usually unable, how-
ever disposed, himself to supply them, or to find any other certain means
whereby to supply them, according to their often great and urgent necessities.
And, therefore, this benevolent and wise regulation, in our law, though sel-
dom exercised, is a most necessary and proper security to the poor, especially
in these times, different from those in which landholders generally resided in
the country, and regularly attended the church; by which means, they not
only had an opportunity to hear and know weekly, the state of the poor in
the parish, but, besides contributing themselves, of setting an example to their
tenants and dependants, also, to contribute to their relief; whereas, it is now
too generally customary for them, not only to reside the greatest part of the
year, if not altogether, in the Capital, or some great town, but, when in the
country, rarely, if at all, to attend public worship.  As this modern practice
has already greatly affected society, so it is particularly hurtful to the inte-
