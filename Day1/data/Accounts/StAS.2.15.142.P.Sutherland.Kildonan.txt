       142                      SUTHERLANDSHIRE.

       (who , had obtained a settlement in that county,- by the marriage
       of one of the Keiths with Marion Cheyne, a Caithness heiress,
       in the fourteenth century) and other neighbouring clans, the Guns
       found it necessary to establish their chief, and a strong detachment
       of the clan, in the adjoining couny of Sutherland, where they
       obtained the protection of the Earls of Sutherland, and from them
       got possession of several lands in the parish of Kildonan and else-
       where.  The history of the clan during these early centuries, as
       collected from tradition, and partly borne out by detached narra-
       tives in Sir Robert Gordon's history, is replete with incidents,
       which, in the present age, have more of the character of wild ro-
       mance than of reality, and exhibits, in many startling details, the
       ferocity and implacable fury which distinguished the feuds of the
       clans in the remote Highlands,* even down to near the close of
       the seventeenth century.  This report does not admit of length-
       ened narratives of these ancient feuds; but one instance may be
       given of the desperate manner in which they were conducted, by
       very briefly narrating the best traditional account that has been
       obtained of the following bloody and treacherous rencounter be-
       tween the Keiths, and the Guns.  The meeting of the parties,
       and the slaughter of the Guns, are, by Sir Robert Gordon, stated
       to have taken place in St Tyr:s Chapel,-an old religious edifice
       on the sea coast of Caithness, and on the walls of which he says
       the blood of the slain might be seen in his time;-but the tradi-
       tion of the Highlands says that this perfidious affair occurred in
       the interior of the country, and in the open air, in Strathmore of
       Caithness.
         Towards the end of the fifteenth century, the chief of the Clan-
       Gun was George Gun, who lived in feudal dignity in his then im-
       pregnable castle of Halbury ; but he was better known as the
       Crowner Gun, or, as be was called by the Highlanders,-" N'm
       Braistach-more," from a great broach which he wore as the badge
       or cognizance of his office of crowner.  He bad a deadly feud
       with the chief of the Keiths, and haying met in St Tyre's chapel
       for the purpose of effecting a reconciliation, but without success, they
       there solemnly agreed to decide their quarrel, if they could not do
       so amicably on a future day, by equal combat between twelve sons

        * Sir Robert Gordon, whose history was written in 1630, thus alludes to "the
       inveterat deidlie feud betuein the clan Gun and the Slaight-ean-Aberigh," (a
       branch of the Mankaya). He remarked "The long , the many, the horrible en-
       counters which happened between these two trybes, with the bloodshed and infinit
       spolla committed in every pair of the diocy of Catteynes by them and their associate
       are of so disordered and troublesome memorie, "that he passes over.- P. 174:
