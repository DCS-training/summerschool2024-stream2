     The Statistical Account.

Robert Bruce's title to the throne, when many of the nobi-
lity could hardly sign their initials.

   Stipends.-The stipends of the two colleague ministers of
Ayr were, when first modified anno 1638 of equal value, or
nearly so; the first being payable, in bear and oat-meal, out of
the teinds; and the other all in money, from the rent of cer-
tain milns, granted to the town for that particular purpose,
by Queen Mary, 1567.  But the progress of agriculture and
commerce and the consequent decrease of the value of mo-
ney, have long ago made a great difference between them
so that the first, at an averaged may now be reckoned worth
L. 130 sterling per annum, besides a glebe; while the other
does not exceed L. 75 sterling per annum.  Whatever the se-
cond minister enjoys above this, is purely a voluntary gratuity
from the town; and the gratuities allowed at different times
since the year 1761 amount now to L. 37 sterling per an-
num.  The patronage of the first charge belongs to the
crown; of the second, to the town council, and kirk session,
jointly.  Neither of the ministers have manses; but the
town, about seven or eight years ago, granted to each of the
present incumbents L. 12:12 sterling per annum, on that
score.

   Provision for the Poor.-For the support of the poor we
have an hospital, which was built by subscription about the
year 1756, which is sufficient to accommodate 60-persons,
old and young.  But many of the poor chuse rather to re-
ceive a small weekly aliment, and to live in houses of their
own.  The funds out of which they are supplied, are the
weekly collections, which may amount to L. 120 sterling per
annum; a contribution of about L. 50 sterling, from different
corporations in the town, and a yearly stent or poors rate of
