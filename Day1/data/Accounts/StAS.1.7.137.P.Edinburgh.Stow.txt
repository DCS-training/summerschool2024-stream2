   Inclosures.-Of late years many inclosures have been made,
and all who either possess land in property, or hold it in
tack, are sensible of the advantage arising from them; but the
farmers think  7 1/2 per cent. too high a premium for dry stone-
dykes, which they must keep in repair.-The culture of
turnips has of late years rapidly increased, in so much that
there is hardly one who possesses 3 or 4 acres who does not
apply some of it in that way.  Young cattle are reared with
the shaws; and the increased quantity of dung is by some
thought adequate to the price of labour, and the land put in
high order for barley and grass.
