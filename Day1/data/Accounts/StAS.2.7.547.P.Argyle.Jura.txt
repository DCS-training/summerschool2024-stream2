Mr M'Neill has planted a considerable extent of ground; and
the forest trees, especially the elm, ash, and sycamore, are in a
very thriving condition. The alder trees about the garden at
Colonsay House have attained a size unequalled in any of the
neighbouring islands.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The islands of Colonsay and Oransay
have not been ecclesiastically separated from the rest of the pa-
rish, but there is a permanent assistant at Colonsay, who was
placed there by the exertions of the present proprietor in 1833.
There is a good church, and the proprietor furnishes the assistant
with a house and garden and other accommodations.
   Inns, &c.-,Near the barbour is a small but neat inn; and, at
a short distance, the smithy.
   February 1844.
