sometimes a little oat-meal and bear, and a few black cattle.
The land rent of the parish is about L. 456 Sterling, con-
verting the victual at 10 s. the boll.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, etc.-The church is covered
with heath, and was built in 1637, and the manse in 1724.
The value of the living, including the glebe, is L. 49:6:8
Sterling, converting the victual at 10 s. the boll.  In the
year 1782, about 20 persons were on the poors roll, which,

etc. after deducting session-clerk and officer fees, amount
to about L. 7, 2 s. Sterling.

   Wages, etc.-A common day-labourer earns 6 d.; a
mason, 1 s.; a carpenter, from 6 d. to 8 d.; and a tailor,
6 d. a day, exclusive of maintenance.  I cannot positively

that they can get employment; and were it not that the
women make something by knitting stockings, and that
the female children are employed in that way as soon as
capable, it would be absolutely impossible for them, with-

in husbandry, are from L. 5 to L. 6 Sterling; those of a
woman, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling; and for boys, from
30 s. to 40 s. Sterling, exclusive of maintenance.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The men are by no means

industrious and economical.  The stature of the men is,
