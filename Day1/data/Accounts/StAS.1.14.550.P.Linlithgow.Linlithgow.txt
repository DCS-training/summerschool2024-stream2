rish is hilly, and more fit for grazing than tillage.  The
soil there is generally wet-bottomed and stiff, and the har-
vest later.  The N. W. and E. parts are mostly arable:
the greatest proportion of these have a light free soil; but
towards the S. and E., a pretty strong clay.  The parish
in general is well cultivated, and almost the whole of it
enclosed and divided with stripes of plantation.  These
improvements have been chiefly made within the last 30
years.  Several gentlemen in the parish have distinguished
themselves in the agricultural line.  None laboured in this
more assiduously, or with greater success, than the late
Mr. Johnston of Straiton.  The effects of his attention
are visible, not only on his own estate, which now a-
mounts in value to about a seventh of the parish, but the
property of another gentleman rented by him, and capable
of being let again to great advantage.  The roads through
the parish, in all directions, are good; thus opening an
extensive communication, and conducing effectually to the
publick benefit.  The ground on the S. rises gradually to
a considerable height, and is distinguished by three emi-
nences. That on the W. is the highest, and bears the
name of Cocklerue.  It rises 500 feet above the level of
the sea.  The eminence on the E. is well known by the
appellation of Binny-craig, and was, in times of ignorance,
considered as a favourite haunt of Fairies.  The high
grounds, in the middle, take their name from the small
village of Riccarton, which lies at the foot of them.
   The rotation of crops varies according to the soil.  On
breaking up the lands, they generally take first oats, then
a green crop, afterwards barley, and grass succeeds.  In
the southern parts of the parish, oats, pease, barley, and
hay, are chiefly the crops in succession; though in some
places they summer fallow for what.  The lands there
