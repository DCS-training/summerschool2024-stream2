rious pursuits in life, are in opulent circumstances. The
greater part of the houses in this place are of mud.  The
mud, when made into mortar, is well mixed with straw;
and the more straw, it is thought the better.  For about
a foot from the foundation, they think it better to
build stones with the mud.  After this, the only pre-
caution that seems necessary is to make a stop at every
2 or 3 feet more height, that the wall may dry, and be-
come firm before they proceed further.  These houses,
if well thatched, are very dry, close, and comfortable,
and last a very long time.  They are sometimes built
the height of 2 storeys.  It adds to the look and dura-
bility, if the walls are harled with lime on the outside.

   The river of Spey and Harbour.-The river Spey rises
on the borders of Lochaber, and runs through Badenoch
and Strathspey, until it comes within about 8 miles of
the sea, nearly in the direction of N. E.; it then runs
due N., and falls into the Murray Frith at Garmouth,
after a course of about 85 miles.  It is said to derive its
name from a Pictish word, signifying froth, from the
rapidity of its stream.  It is the most rapid river in
Scotland, and, except it be Tay, is the largest; and
though it does not ordinarily appear so large as Tay, it
is thought by some to run as much water in the year.
Its fall from the Boat of Bog, nigh Gordon Castle, to
the sea, the distance only of 3 miles, is 60 feet.  Below
this, it runs in a flat of about a mile in breadth, between
the Bank of Bellie on the one side, and that of Spey-
mouth on the other, which there is every appearance
that it has formed*.  From the great fall towards the
