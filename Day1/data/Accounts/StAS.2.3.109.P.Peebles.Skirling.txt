			SKIRLING.                             109

these thirty years, at great expense, and with much labour in banking
and draining, upwards of 100 acres have been raised from a boggy
barren condition, yielding a little coarse dry bay, into a very pro-
ductive state, and, by deepening Biggar water, which lies on the
southern boundary, eighteen inches or two feet, up from Brough-
ton bridge, that already reclaimed would be rendered a great deal
more fertile, and more would be recovered in this parish, while in
those adjacent several hundred acres would be gained. The thing
has been proposed, and we have no doubt as to its ultimate accom-
plishment.
    There is another thing which demands attention, and that is the
present want of plantations and fences.  Were these in greater
abundance, while they would afford shelter, a thing greatly needed
generalIy in Scotland, they would likewise render Skirling one of the
sweetest parishes in her mountainous domains; nor are we without
good expectations that this will not be long overlooked.  There are
a number of farms let upon tacks of fifty-seven years' duration, and
these, unfortunately, are so scattered up and down, as every where
to fetter the proprietor in the free exercise of his pleasure, but
they are now drawing to a close; and from the well-known disposition
of Sir Thomas Carmichael to do what is for the advantage of his
estates, and from what he has actually done on his property in the
parish of Kirkurd, we anticipate the period when the ditcher shall
be preparinIg the thorn-bed, and the diker shall be plying his ham-
mer, and the planter his spade, and the bleakness of the unenclosed
plain, and the unwooded hill, shall no longer glare upon the eye of
the observer.

May 1834.
