   Young men, from 14 to 16 years of age, will sometimes
make 40 pairs worsted stockings in one week, and at the
usual hours allotted to labour.  These stockings generally
sell at 3 s. 6 d. a pair.
   The medium gain of the frame-worker may amount to
7 s 6 d. or 8 s. a week.
   The worsted is chiefly upon on the two-handed Leicester-
shire wheel.
   A woman who is adiligent and capable spinner, will
earn from 5 s to 6 s. weekly.  The average gains are from
2 s. 6d. to 3s.
   A considerable quantity of the stockings are disposed of
in wholesale, to the shopkeepers in the twon and country;
but the principal market for the manufacture is London.
   The linen trade is still continued, though on a more con-
tracted scale than formerly.  This branch may now employ
about 20 weavers.

   Soap and Candles.-A soap and candle work, belonging
to a company in Banff, employs a manager and four men,
and pays annually to Government L. 500 Sterling.

   Brewery.-The brewing of ale, beer, and porter, is car-
ried on here to a considerable extent.  The annual consump-
tion of barley is generally 1200 bolls; and the duty to Go-
vernment L. 700.  The number of hands employed amount
to eight.  The strong beer has long been in high repute,
and in great demand, from various and distant parts of the
country.  The porter, when kept in bottle about a year,
is sufficiently palatable, and has been known sometimes
to deceive the taste of a connoisseur in that wholesome be-
veridge.
