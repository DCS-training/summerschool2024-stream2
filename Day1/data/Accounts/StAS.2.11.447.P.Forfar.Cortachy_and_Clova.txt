<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

         In 1775, the population amounted to          1233
            1790,                                     1020
            1800,                                      906
            1811,                                      930
            1831, males, 419; females, 493;            912
            1841,                                      867

	The decrease in the population since the time of the former
Statistical Account, appears to have been chiefly owing to the re-
moval of several families to the nearest manufacturing towns.
	There is no village in the united parish.

        Habits and Character of the People.-The people are cleanly
in their habits; their dress is becoming and comfortable; they
enjoy the necessaries and many of the comforts of life. As to
their general character, they are intelligent, peaceable, industrious,
hospitable, satisfied with their situation and circumstances, and
attentive to the outward ordinances of religion. There has been
no smuggling for several years past; and poaching in game is
very little practised by any of the inhabitants.
