     UNITED PARISHES OF BONKLE AND PRESTON.

     (County of Berwick.)

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT DOUGLAS.

     Name, Situation, Extent.

   THE parishes of Bonkle and Preston, were originally
two separate parishes, but are now united.  Bonkle 
is supposed to be derived from bona cella.  It lies in the
county of Berwick, presbytery of Dunse, and synod of 
Kelso.  It is nearly a square of six miles, and contains 8,900
acres.

   Soil.-In the high lands towards the Lammermoor hills,
the soil is thin, dry, heathy, and poor; but it has of late
been much improved by lime.  The rest of the parish, and 
particularly on the banks of the Whittater, consists of a fine
fertile loam.

   Air and Diseases.-As in most parts of the east of Scot-
land, the air is very healthy.  Formerly the people were
very subject to agues in the spring; but since improvements
have commenced, and been carried to a very considerable
state of perfection, this disease has almost totally disappeared.
This effect is attributed to the bogs and swamps being drain-
ed, and to the improvement of the surface.
