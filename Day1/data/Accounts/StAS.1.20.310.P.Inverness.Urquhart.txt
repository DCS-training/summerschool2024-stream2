     Statistical Account

   At all the above places there are good gardens, which,
in favourable seasons, yield abundance of excellent  fruit.
   At  the foot of Glenmoriston, on the banks of Loch-
ness, Invermoriston, the seat of Major Grant, is situa-
ted.  Nature has done a great deal for the place, in the
grand and sublime style.  The proprietor shews a dis-
position to cultivate and improve this place as it de-
serves.  There are excellent gardens at Invermoriston,
which produce as early and high flavoured fruit as it to be
found in any part of the north of Scotland.  About 40
years ago, the Trustees feued a piece of ground at Invermo-
riston, on which they erected buildings for establishing a ma-
nufacture of linen-cloth, and instructing the youth of that
Glen in industry and the principles of literature.  Artisans,
as weavers and spinners, with a schoolmaster and mistress
or governess, were brough from the Low Country, and the
management of the business committed to the deceased Mr
Shaw, a very respectable and propere man for the trust,
But, after several years trial, without much effect in pro-
moting the purpose intended, the scheme was finally aban-
doned, and the feu resold to the family of Glenmoriston.

   Roads and Bridges.-The principal roads which go
through Urquhart are, 1. That from Inverness to Fort-Au-
gustus, along the north-west side of Lochness.  This road
was begu soon after the year 1760, but on account of its
extreme difficulty, and the narroness of the funds, was
carried on but slowly for many years; however, by dint of
perserverance, repeated aids from the country of Inverness,
and several liberal subscriptions from the proprietors and
other gentlemen connected with the parish, an excellent
road is now made through the woods and rocks of Aber-
iachan, as far as the Strath of Urquhart, where an exceed-
ing good innn has been lately built by Sir James Grant
