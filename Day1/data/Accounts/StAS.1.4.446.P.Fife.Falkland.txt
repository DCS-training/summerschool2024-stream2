turally lead a writer to wish, that he could add more in-
stances of public spirit and beneficence, or that, by a course
of strict and judicious economy, the means of doing good
were accumulating.  In this respect, Falkland claims no
distinguished superiority to similarly circumstanced burghs,
nor is it perhaps justly chargeable with greater degeneracy.
It only adds to that mass of considerations which calls aloud
for borough reformation.  Great as the evil is of the want
of economy, or the mismanagement of public revenue, it
is small, compared to the neglect or mismanagement of pu-
blic authority and power.  Magistracy is highly respectable,
and will always be respected by every man of sense, and
friend to the public weal.  It is more particularly so when
it is contemplated, as descending from the supreme, to eve-
ry subordinate magistrate, invested with the sacred majesty
of public law, and circumscribed by the rules of equal ju-
stice.  But where office is not decently supported, it were
better not to exist.  There are not wanting, in our country,
many instances in which the vigilance, activity, and patrio-
tism of magistrates do them great honour, and mark them
out to public respect, as public blessings; at the same time,
it cannot escape the observation of partiality itself, that
there is sometimes little or nothing of its spirit to be found
in those who are invested with the office.  There is a na-
tural disposition in mankind, to respect and reverence offi-
cial authority; but when it is degraded by office-bearers,
the contempt and irreverence which naturally fall upon
them, descend to their office, and are productive of the
most pernicious consequences to the great body of the
people.
