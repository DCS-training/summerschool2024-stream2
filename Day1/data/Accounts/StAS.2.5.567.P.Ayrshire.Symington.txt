called the Mote-hill, upon which a ruin stands; but of which tradi-
tion takes no notice.
         Modern Buildings.-These are Williamfield House, which was
erected about eight years ago by Mrs Fairlie of Williamfield; its erec-
tion and the surrounding improvements cost upwards of L. 20,000.
A large conservatory is at one end of the house, in which is a
large collection of rare and valuable plants; and in front of the
house, there is an artificial lake, more than a quarter of a mile in
length, in which there is an island planted with trees and shrubs.
Water-fowls are seen swimming in abundance, both wild and do-
mesticated. Townend House is beautifully situated on an emi-
nence. It is built of dressed whin rock, with hewn freestone corners,
&c. which has a beautiful effect. Dankeith and Rosemount
houses are of an older date, very commodious, finely situated, and
surrounded with thriving plantations, &c.
