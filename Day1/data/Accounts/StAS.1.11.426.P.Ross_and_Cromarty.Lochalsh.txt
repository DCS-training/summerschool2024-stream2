be eat with the potatoes during the harvest, winter, and
spring.  Though 63 boats be employed in this manner, there

pox by inoculation, now become universal over this coast, and
practised with success, has also very much contributed to pre-
serve the lives of the people+.  The emancipation of the
lower classes, too, from the remains of feudal oppression, and

   Church, Poor, Schools, etc.-The church was built in 1641.
It was repaired and stated in 1766, and lately furnished with
commodious seats.  The living, including the glebe, is worth.
65 L. per annum.  The patronage is vested in the Crown.  The
fole heritor, Mr. M'Kenzie of Seaforth, does not reside in
the parish.  All the people come to the Established Church,
excepting 62 Roman Catholics, who attend a Popish meeting-
house in the neighbouring parish of Kintail.-The number of
poor at present on the parish roll is 35.  The only fund for
their support, arising from collections at the church door, does
not exceed 7 L. per annum, which is distributed by the kirk-
session according to their necessities.  The parochial school is
situated near the church.  The salary is 200 merks Scotch.
Last year, the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge
restored one of their schools to a detached district of the pa-
rish with a salary of 15 L. Sterling.

distemper, visiting them in the natural way, gave cause to many unhappy pa-
rents, to bewail the loss of a whole family of children.
