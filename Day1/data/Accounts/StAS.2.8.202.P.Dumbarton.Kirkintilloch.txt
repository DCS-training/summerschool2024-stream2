Twechar and Auchinvole, 4; Will-head to Gartcloss, &c., 3;
Oxgang to Bedcow and Mossfinnin bridge about 3; Townhead
to Boghead, 1; Gartcommon to Badenheath, 4; Deerdyke to
Shangan, 1; = 19 miles.
   The road-money collected is at the rate of L. 2 Sterling on
every L. 100 of valuation. It is as follows:-Road money for
landward part of the parish, L. 74, 16s. 6d.; do for burgh, L.63;
horses at 10s. 6d. each, viz. twenty belonging to carters in town,
L.10, 10s. = L.148, 6s.
