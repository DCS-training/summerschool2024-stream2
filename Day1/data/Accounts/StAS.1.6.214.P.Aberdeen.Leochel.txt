and no lime is to be had within 12 or 14 miles.  Some of the
most industrious and substantial tenants now begin to carry
lime-shells from Aberdeen, which are brought thither from
Sunderland and the Firth of Forth.  The measure contains 32
Scotch pints to the sirlot; 4 of which make a boll.  The Scotch
lime is sold from 2 s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 d. and the English from 2 s. 8 d.
to 3 s. per boll; 22 of which are sufficient for an acre of light
ground; and clay ground will require from 20 to 26.  Lime
answers as well with the soil, and raises as good crops, as in
any other part of the country.
   Mr David Scot of Craigivar, the most opulent, intelligent,
and industrious farmer in this parish, has expended L. 50
sterling yearly, for 5 years past, upon lime brought from
Aberdeen; and, notwithstanding the long carriage, (28 miles)
finds his interest greatly promoted by it.  He farms the Mains
of Craigivar, consisting of 166 acres of good arable land, which
he has inclosed, improved, and properly subdivided with stone
and earth fences, and planted some thorns which thrive very
well, without gathering moss or fog.  The bottom of these
inclosures is washed by one of the rivulets, which turns 5
corn-mills, 1 barley-mill, and 2 fulling-mills.-If the te-
nants were industrious, many of them have great command of
water for manure; which, when put upon dry out-field land
and properly attended to in the spreading, and removal from
place to place upon the ground, (which some are now begin-
ning to do), raises as good crops, both of corn and sown grass,
as lime can possibly produce.
   There is a great deal of out-field in the parish, when com-
pared with the in town ground.  The in-field is constantly in
tillage.  The out-field is manured with cattle and sheep kept
in folds in the summer season; bears five crops of corn, and
is as long rested; but carries little or no grass.  The acre of
in-field is commonly let at from 13 s. 4 d. to 20 s. and the out-
