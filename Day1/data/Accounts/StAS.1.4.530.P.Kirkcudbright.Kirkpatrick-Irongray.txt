L. 7.  As there are no villages in the parish, the scholars
are not numerous, seldom 30, even in winter; and the
master is obliged to teach 2 years in a house near the church,
and alternately other 2 years 3 miles up the parish.  The
quarter wages are from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s.  People at a distance
from either school hire a lad for themselves, who goes from
one family to another, along with his scholars, by turns.-The
poor have been from 14 to 18.  The annual collections may
be about L. 14.  There is L. 6, 10 s. arising from interest of
lent money, and they have L. 2, 10 s. of land-rent.  None
beg, it is believed, nor need beg out of the parish.  To af-
ford relief for the deficiency of crop 1782, a liberal contri-
bution was made for the poor.  In fact, there was no scar-
city of provision in the parish, though dear, as the best part-
tipens early, and though the corns were covered with snow
for some days in some of the highest parts of the moor
farms.  Among the worst things in the police of te coun-
try, is the permission of vagrants and sturdy beggars from all
parts, especially from the large village called the Bridgend
of Dumfries, which has no magistrate.  That village is a
receptacle of people of that sort from the three kingdoms.
These, from pretence of fishing or trafficking or begging, spy
out what is for their purpose in the day-time, and in the
night return, and at times commit considerable depredations.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 895.  Upon an enumeration in 1778, there
were gound 585 examinable persons.  All the alteration, in
a general view of the parish since that time, may amount to
610.  There are 25 heritors, 7 or 8 of whom reside.  Of
Dissenters there are 9 Cameronians and 10 Seceders.
