where on an average 2000 fish are caught yearly.  The herring-
fishery is that which has been carried on most extensively in the
parish.  At one time it promised to be profitable; of late, how-
ever, it has turned out a ruinous speculation, as the annexed ac-
counts will show.

  Manu factures--From twenty to thirty tons of kelp were annually
manufactured in this parish until 1832; but since then, as its place
has been supplied by cheaper substitutes, the price has suffered
such a depression as to render it no object for employing labourers

  Means of Communication.--There is no market-town in the parish;
the nearest is Thurso, in the county of Caithness, distant
forty-five miles.  There is a post-office in the village of Tongue,
and mails run three times a-week to Thurso, and twice a-week to
Golspie.  There is also a post to Durness, whose days of arriving
and starting correspond to those of the Golspie mail.  The vehicle
from Golspie carries three passengers; that from Thurso carries
four inside and four outside.  A lighter vehicle, however, runs on
this latter line during winter, which only accommodates five passengers.
The length of roads in the parish is 393/4 miles.  Of these, 11
are Parliamentary, 14 3/4 county trust roads, and 14 private tenantry
roads.  They are kept in excellent repair.  The bay of Tongue
is crossed by a ferry 1262 yards broad.  In 1830-31, slip quays
were built, and proper boats procured.  This ferry, which is a
great annoyance to travellers, might be shortened to a fourth of its
present breadth, by constructing a mound between the point of
Tongue, and the island adjacent there to.  As the water here is
not very deep, nor the current strong, and as profusion ot mate-
