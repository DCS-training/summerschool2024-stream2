slope gently toward the east. They repose upon a bed of sand-
stone, of a whitish-greY colour; but in passing downward it be-
comes a whitish-yellow, and at last shades away into a yellowish-
brown.
   A general idea of the different strata of rock may be conveyed
in the following accurate table of Lieutenant-Colonel Imrie, as
given in the second volume of the Memoirs of the Wernerian
Natural History Society.

               Table of Strata at Murray's Hall.
    1. Vegetable soil, about	                        2 feet in thickness.

   13. Slate-clay containing narrow lines of sandstone, 8
   14. Slate clay almost black,	                       17
   15. Dark-bluish grey limestone with entrochi   	6
         and small particles of pyrites imbedded,       6
   16. Bituminous shale passing into slate clay,	6
   17. Bituminous shale with a mixture of calca-
         reous matter and pyrites, depth unknown.

  A few simple minerals are found in this district of the parish.
Calc-spar is obtained along with the limestone. Heavy spar is met
with in several parts of the moorland district. Ironstone of excellent
quality is found in balls, in the roof of the upper coal seam at
Auchenbowie, and has been wrought along with the coal for the
last fifteen years; calc-tuff is also obtained at the same place.
The common jasper and agate are sometimes met with. In the
soil and sub-soil are found blocks of granite, small-grained gneiss,
mica-slate with garnets, clay-slate, red sandstone, quartz, compact
felspar, claystone porphyry, sandstone, chlorite slate, conglomerate
rocks, basaltic hornblende, and sometimes shale and coal blended
with calcareous spar.
   Few fossil organic remains are found in the parish. Those that
belong to the animal kingdom are chiefly bivalve shells. A few
of the univalve shells are also met with in the shale accompanying
the limestone. When sinking the coal-pits in Plean, a bed of shale
is met with, composed almost entirely of bivalve shells, belonging
to the Mytilus genus. In the vegetable kingdom are found the
remains of Lepidodendron, Stigmaria, and Sigillaria.
