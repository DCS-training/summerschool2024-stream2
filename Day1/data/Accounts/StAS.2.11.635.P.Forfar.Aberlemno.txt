miles and two individuals are Episcopalian. Three families are
Seceders, and as many attend the Relief. The average number
of communicants in the Established Church is about 330.
   Education.-There is only one school in the parish, the paro-
chial. Another is much needed in the district of Balgavies, and
means are being used to obtain it. The schoolmaster has the
maximum salary.
   Library.-There is a parish library, consisting chiefly of histo-
rical, biograpbical, and religious works.
   Poor.-The average number of impotent persons receiving pa-
rochial relief is about 18. They receive, except in a few instances
where more is given, 1s. per week. Orphans, and other deserted
or neglected children, add greatly to the burdens of the parish;
for the discharge of which the session receives the average Sunday
collection of l0s., the collections of two annual communions, and
a voluntary assessment from the heritors of L.84. With those who
have been brought up in the parish, or resided in it any considerable
length of time, there is in general a praiseworthy reluctance to
receive parochial charity; but with some who are in the actual re-
ceipt of it, and especially with those who have been but a short
time in the parish, and with all those who care little for religious
ordinances, and seldom appear in the house of God, there is a
growing importunity, and a total want of that Christianized feel-
ing of independence which once constituted the true nobility of
the Scottish nation.
