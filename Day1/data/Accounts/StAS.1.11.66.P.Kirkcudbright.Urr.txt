30 months old, will weigh from 30 to 35 stones, and will sell

   Sheep.-The sheep kept in Urr are not numerous.  By the
best information, there are, just now, about 900 in the parish.
Those kept in the moor farms are of the black faced kind.
Their wool, consequently is coarse.  On the farms that have
been well cultivated, the sheep are generally of the English
breed, and the wool is fine and more abundant.
   Here it may be proper to observe, that, in the reign of
James VI., Galloway was understood to produce the finest
wool in Scotland, perhaps in Britain.  William Lithgow says,
he had seen finer wool in Galloway than ever he saw in Spain.
Even to this day, in some particular farms, the wool is re-
markably fine, and of a brilliant whiteness.  The sheep from
which this wool is cut, are white faced, rather small, and in
all respects seem very much to resemble the sheep of the Shet-
land Isles.  Finding that the white faced sheep, with fine
wool, had once been the common stock of every farm in Gal-
loway, it became a question, Whence the black faced sheep,
whose wool is scarce worth cutting, were imported?  But no
investigation or inquiry upon this subject, was attended with
any satisfaction.  It may be observed, that Galloway, in its
uncultivated state, abounded with goats, which, in moorish
and mossy tracts, are almost uniformly of a black colour.
Now, that the goat and the sheep easily, nay commonly, breed
together, is undeniable; and that the mules so produced are
as fruitful as either the separate breed of goats, or of sheep,
is a fact that cannot be disputed.  In every farm, in the
wilder parts of Galloway, at this day, where flocks of goats
and sheep are kept, at no great distance from one another,
every spring we see, among the sheep especially, several mong-
