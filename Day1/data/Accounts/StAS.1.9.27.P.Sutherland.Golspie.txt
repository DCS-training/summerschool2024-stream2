     of Golspy.

By the most direct road from one end to another, it is 10
measured miles in length, and from sea to hill in the
broadest part, about a mile and an half, and about a
mile in the narrowest part, exclusive of a good deal
of barren hilly ground.  There is a bank which runs
along the burn of Golspy due west from the sea for 5
miles, where there are several inhabitants.  It is flat
for 10 miles in length from the coast, and from a
mile to a mile and a half in breadth.  The soil in
general light, but of a good quality and fertile.  In some
parts it is deep, and mixed with clay, and very fertile.  The
S. W. end is sandy; the N. E. end stony.  No part is
high, or having high rocks.  The hills on the side facing
the sea are covered with short black heath, and somewhat
rocky.  On the opposite side the heath is long, with a mix-
ture of grass, and the ground for most part mossy.  The
air is dry and healthy.  There are haddocks, whitings, cod,
small rock red cod, cuddies, skate, fine turbot and flounders,
taken with lines.  On the Little Ferry branch, mussels,
cockles, are gathered in plenty; flounders, trouts of various
kinds, and a few salmon are taken with nets.  All those are
in season as in other places:  The country around purchase
all.  Seals and porpoises are on the coast; sometimes small
whales are seen near it; and there are instances of
some being driven on shore.  About 5 or 6 years ago,
haddocks were a penny the score; now they are a penny
each.  There is a good deal both of tangle and bell-weed
on the coast, and used for manuring the lands to great ad-
vantage.  About 30 ton of kelp is made every third
year.  The tides run from east to west, and from west to
east.  There is a pretty strong current in the Little Ferry,
but not remarkable.
