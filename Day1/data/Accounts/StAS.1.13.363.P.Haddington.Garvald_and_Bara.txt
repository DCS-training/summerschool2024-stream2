     of Garvald and Baro.

Noble family.  Both this elegant mansion and its pleasure-
ground have been greatly improved by the present Marquis
of Tweeddale, a nobleman of a most amiable character, and
of a fine taste.  The enclosures and pleasure-ground of Yester
are about 10 miles in circumference, in which are woods
and plantations to a great extent.  A considerable part of
the wood with which the castle of Yester is almost sur-
rounded, is within the limits of the parish of Garvald.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The valued rent of the
parish is L. 4133 Scots; the real rent cannot be easily as-
certained.  Farms are rented for the course of a 19 years
lease at from 10 s. to L. 1, 5 8. the acre.  A great many
farms are let by the lump, particularly those in which part
of the Lammermoor Hills are included. There are three
threshing machines in the parish.  The original cost of
each is about L. 60 or L. 70 Sterling; they are drawn by
4 horses, and require 6 or 7 people to attend the opera-
tion; they thresh at the rate of 5 or 6 bolls in an hour.
Coals are generally used for fuel in this parish, and a few
peats.  Fourteen stone of coals (or what is here called a
load) now cost 7 d. which 10 or 12 years ago cost only 5 d.
They are mostly brought from Penstone and Pencaitland,
at the distance of 6 or 7 miles.-A few years ago a society
of a charitable complexion was established in this parish.
The design of this society is to afford relief to the sick, the
infirm, and the aged.  Every member at his entrance
pays 1 s. and as long as he continues a member, the same
sum quarterly.  This Society hath already afforded relief
to several persons in distrels, who otherwise must have
come upon the poors funds.  On which account they merit
the attention and encouragement of the public.
