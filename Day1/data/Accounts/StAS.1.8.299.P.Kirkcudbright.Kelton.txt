     of Kelton.

   Produce and Exportation.-The chief produce of Kelton is
oats, which are of a very good quality.  A considerable quan-
tity of barley, and bigg, or bear, is raised in the parish; and
some wheat.  Rye, pease, and beans, are not much cultivat-
ed; but there is plenty of potatoes for home consumption,
and a good deal for exportation.  The lands are generally
laid down, or sown out, with rye-grass and clover.  Few have 
yet paid attention to Turnips.  The average exportation of
grain is, of late years, about 2000 bolls, each boll containing
11 Winchester bushels, or 22,000 Winchester bushels in whole.
The markets are, the north of England, and the west of Scot-
land.  The oats, when well cleaned, yield rather more than
a stone of meal per bushel.  One great hindrance to improve-
ments, in this place, is the high multures.  Hemp and flax
are not much attended to in this parish.

   Black Cattle, Sheep, etc.-The staple commodity of Galloway,
which comprehends the shire of Wigton, and stewartry of
Kirkcudbright, is black cattle and sheep.  Besides what are
used in home consumption, many thousands of black cattle
are annually driven to the English markets.  The black cattle
in Kelton amount to above 2000, are strong made, and of a
middle size.  The sheep do not exceed 1000.  Those fed upon
the hills are of the small old breed of the country; those fed
on the lower and improved grounds, are much larger; gene-
rally of a mixed English breed, and have finer wool; but are
stronger, and not so pleasant to the taste, as the small kind.
There are above 300 horses in the parish.-There are 50
ploughs, and 89 carts employed, in husbandry.

   Population.-The present state of population in Kelton is
1600 souls.  The return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, was 811;
