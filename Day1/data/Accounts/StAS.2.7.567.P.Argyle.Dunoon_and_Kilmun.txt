        PRESBYTERY OF DUNOON, SYNOD OF ARGYLE.


        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  THE united parish of Dunoon and Kilmun, in the county of
Argyle and district of Cowal, lies on the northern side, or, as our
Lowland neighbours term it, the Highland side of the Frith of
Clyde. Strictly speaking, its sea-shore boundary forms the north-
ern coast of that frith only from the point of Strone, in Kilmun
parish, to the point of Toward, in Dunoon parish, this range also
embracing the arm of the sea called the Holy Loch. From the point
of Strone, the coast line of the parish runs along and forms the west-
ern shnre of Loch Long, extending nearly to the entrance of
Lochgoil, where that arm of the sea branches off from Loch Long:
and from the point of Toward, its coast line, to the parish boundary
in that direction trending north-westward, forms the eastern shore
