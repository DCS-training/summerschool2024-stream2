	Parochial Registers.--The register of baptism and marriages
go back to the year 1641, but there was no register of deaths till
about forty years ago. The registers began in 1641, were regular-
ly kept for a considerable time, but were afterwards for a long pe-
riod very much neglected. For the last fifty years they have beem
kept in a most regular manner. The first volume having been
written in an old hand, and difficult to be made out, the present
schoolmaster was induced to copy the whole thereof into a new
book, which copy was, by the late Rev. William Thomson, then
minister of the parish, compared with the original, and attested by
him on the 3d November 1803.
	Antiquities.--A part of the village is built on what was formerly
a camp. but of its history there is little or nothing knowm. At the
toll-bar, on the road to Ayr, there is a place called the Moat,
where, a few years ago, was found an urn with calcined bones, and,
last spring, a ploughamn, in turning up the soil, found a crown piece
of James I. of England, in good preservation, the inscription quite
legible, and within it the sword and mace.--Of the old castle of
Ochiltree that stood on the banks of the Lugar, nothing remains
but the foundation; the stoens having beem taken away at different
times to build houses and dikes on the adjoining farms. There are
the ruins of an old castle at Auchinclocih, but by whom, of for what
purpose it was built in that hilly district, is not known. There is,
detached from the rock on the banks of the Lugar, a large stone
abour 60 feet high, by 40 feet in lenght, and 20 feet in breadth, par-
tially covered on the rop with shrubs, heather, and grass. It is re-
garded as a great curiosity, and called, from its peculiar form,
Kemp's castle.
