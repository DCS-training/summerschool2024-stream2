   was 9s. 4d. In 1792, the average number of enrolled poor was
   32, and the average yearly allowance to each was L.1, 1s. 3d.
   In 1836 and 1837, the average number of enrolled poor was
   21,* and the average yearly allowance to each L. 2, 1s. Average
   amount of weekly collections in one year, L.26; do. of penalties,
   L.5, 5s.; average proceeds from mortcloth, 16s.; interest of L.120,
   capital at 5 per cent. L.6; do. of L. 55, at 3 per cent.  L.1, 13s.
   sale of effects of deceased poor, L.2; donations from heritors, va-
   rying from L.5 to L.15, L. 10; total yearly amount of poor's funds,
   L.51, 14s.; average amount distributed to enrolled poor, L.43, Is.;
   balance, L.8,13s.
     Out of the above balance, L.4 are paid to the clerk and precen-
   tor; L.1, 12s to the church officer; and the remainder is distribut-
   ed among persons in occasional distress, who are not on the roll,
   or is laid out in defraying the funeral charges of the deceased poor,
   or other incidental expenses.
     Besides the ordinary church collections, amounting on an average
   to L.26 a year, we have extraordinary collections for charitable
   or religious purposes, varying, according to, circumstances, from
   L.1, 10s. to L.5, 5s. During the eighteen nYonths preceding
   Martinmas last, our collections in the church for the General As-
   sembly's four schemes, for the Aberdeen Infirmary, and the Des-
   titute Highlanders, amounted to L.17, 16s. 10d. In peculiar
   cases of distress, the relief of which might, press heavy on the
   funds of the poor, recourse is occasionally bad to subscriptions in
   the parish, which have always been attended with the desired re-
   sult. For two years past, the poor's funds have been relieved of an
   incidental burden of about L.10, 10s. a-year, by an annual sub-
   scription from the heritors.
     Having no fund for the poor arising from benefactions suffi-
   ciently large to discourage industry, or excite avarice, applications
   for parochial relief are generally made with great reluctance. The
   poor think themselves degraded by such applications.
     Inns.--There is at present only one inn or tavern in the pa-
   rish.
     Fuel.--Peats, although not so abundant and excellent as for-
   merly, are obtained in those parts of thelparish which are farthest
   from the sea. In a few cases, peats are obtained from neighbour-

     * Out of 21 paupers on the roll, 19 are females. Could no sort of remunerative
   employment be suggested for this distressed class of the connnunity?
