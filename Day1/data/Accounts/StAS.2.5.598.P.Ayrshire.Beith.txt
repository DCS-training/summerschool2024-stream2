he-paid a visit to his native country, where he spent some days
among his friends in Beith, and preached in the church. He died
on 15th November 1794, in the 73d year of his age. His family
and descendants are numerous and respectable. His fame did
not die with him, as his theological writings, particularly his cele-
brated "Essay on Regeneration," are quoted as works of great merit.
His whole works were published at Edinburgh 1804, in nine volumes,
octavo, and some of them have reached several editions. He was
succeeded in Beith by Mr David M'Lellan, a man of whom it
was said that he united in his character the gentleman, scholar, and
Christian. He died 22d October 1796, and was succeeded by Mr.
Robert M'Vey. In his time, the stipend, which had remained for
170 years without any increase, was augmented to 8 chalders meal,
L. 400 Scots of money, and L. 100 Scots for communion element.
A new manse was built in 1796, and a new church was begun
20th March 1807, and opened for divine service on 19th August
1810. The church is set down on the lands of Knockbuckle, and
stands high; its site is 343 feet above the level of the sea. When
the church was removed a small part of the old building was al-
lowed to remain, to preserve the clock and bell for the use of the
town.
	Mr M'Vey died 3d July 1811, and was succeeded by Mr
James Muir. During his incumbency, the stipend was augment-
ed to 16 chalders of victual; half meal, half barley with L. 15 Ster-
ling for communion elements. Mr Muir died in 1831, and was
succeeded by the present incumbent, who was translated from Kil-
winning, to which parish be was ordained in 1824.
	The church, as is before-mentioned, was opened for public
worship in August 1810. It is seated for 1254 persons, giving
18 inches for each sitting. At the division, the heritors set apart
183 sittings for the use of the inhabitants of the town. They are
let annually for the benefit of the poor's fund. The remainder of
the church was divided among the heritors which gave, them a
sitting for L.6, 10s. Scots of valued rent. The church and tower
cost L.2790. The bell in the tower, one of the finest toned in
the west country, was the gift of Robert Shedden, Esq. Gower
Street, London, a native the parish, of whom some notice is
taken elsewhere. The church, manse, and offices are all in a good
state of repair.

rish. In a character dated 14th November 1644, there occurs the
