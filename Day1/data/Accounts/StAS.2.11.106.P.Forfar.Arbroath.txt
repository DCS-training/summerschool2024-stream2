there are accounts kept in the name of individuals for behoof of
temporary societies, consisting of from 50 to 80 individuals, who
pay each sixpence or a shilling weekly, which accumulates till a
term, when it is uplifted for the purpose of paying rents, &c.  Since
1830, two societies have been formed in the village of Auchmithie,
in the adjoining parish of St Vigeans, among the fishermen, each
consisting of 25 members, who pay sixpence weekly, and deposit
the amount in the savings bank.  Thus, the ramifications of the
institution are much farther spread than the number of depositors
would at first sight appear to indicate.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The parish of Arbroath is not sub-
jected to the curse of an assessment for the support of the poor.
The following is the number of persons, in the years 1830, 1831,
and 1832, rebehving parochial aid, with the sums allotted for their
maintenance.

The allowance to weekly pensioners on the poors' roll varies from
9d. to 4s. per week. The usual allowance may be stated at 1s.
per week.  There is also expended annually by the kirk-session
about L.45 for coals to the poor. The annual cost of lunatics is
from L. 30 to L. 40. The amount of funds for the support of the
poor, under the management of the session, during the years 1830,
1831, and 1832, is as follows:

Arising from collections at the parish
	church and chapel of ease,     L. 202 11 9 1/2  L. 194 11 3 L. 194 19 10 1/2
Arising from mortifications and other
	sources,                          162  1 2 1/2     150 16 1    121 13  9 1/2

	The total expenditure for the poor has been, in 1830, L. 375,
6s. 2d.; in 1831, L. 357, 7s. 2d.; and, in 1832, L. 366, 19s. 5d.
It appears, from the above statement, that, during these years, the
expenditure has exceeded the income. This has arisen, partly,
from "untoward events" in connection with the chapel of ease,
where the collections have fallen off one-half of what they were
some time ago. But the cause of this defalcation of revenue, will,
it is hoped, be speedily removed, that the evils of a compulsory
assessment may be avoided.
	Prisons.--There is a jail in the burgh of Arbroath. It is well
