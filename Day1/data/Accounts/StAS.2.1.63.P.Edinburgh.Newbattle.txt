        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--NEWBATTLE or Newbottle, as it is spelt, has been,
time immemorial the name of this parish; but of it origin I have
not been able to discover any satisfactory account, and tradition is
often too vague to be depended on. The parish was once divided
into two, Newbattle and Maisterton. When they were united is
uncertain.
   Extent,&c.--Its greatest extent in length is about 4 1\2 miles;
and it& greatest breadth about 3. Its mean length and breadth

wick; on the south, by Borthwick and Cockpen; on the west, by
Lasswade; and on the north, by Dalkeith.
   From its extremities it rises gradually in every derection, till it
terminates in a ridge if considerable extent, known by the name
of the Roman: Camp; the elevation of Which, above the sea, is
680 feet.

the village of Newbattle, however, for the last nineteen years, old
