was found so far from being an improvement, that they sold
them off as speedily as possible.
   The number of black cattle, except cows for milk, are
comparatively small.  The number of farmers horses, both
for work and riding, is 39; and of farmers and hinds or
herds cows, is 50.  For some time past only 12 oxen have
been reared; 40 Highland cattle have been bought in and
fed off.  Among the small tenants, and inhabitants who
have no land at all, are kept 76 horses.  The number of
their milk cows may be about 64, besides some of them
bringing up young ones.

   Common.-There is a common in this parish of about
200 acres in extent, of which 40 or 50 are thought im-
proveable.  There is very little wood, and the gentlemen
seem not disposed to plant any, although there is abundance
of land fit for no other use.

   Population.-This parish has, I suppose, more than dou-
bled its population in this course of this century, because
many villages in the neighbouring parishes of Hounam,
Morbottle, and Linton, have been totally razed since the
memory of people now living, and many of the inhabitants
have withdrawn into the towns of Yetholm and Kirk-
Yetholm, two villages in which the greatest number of this
parish dwell; the former belonging to Mr Wauchope, and
situated upon the north-west side of the Bowmont water;
the other belonging to the Marquis of Tweeddale, and on the
south-east side of said water.
   When the present incumbent was ordained in the year
1786, he, in the course of his parochial visitation, found the
number of souls to be in Town-Yetholm 539, in Kirk-
Yetholm 323, and in the rest of the parish 208, making in
all 1070 souls.  There were 491 males, and 579 females.
