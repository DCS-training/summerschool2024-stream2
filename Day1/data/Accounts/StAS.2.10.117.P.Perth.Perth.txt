	   According to this table, there were in the year referred to, in
	all the places of public worship in the parish, 15,024 sittings; of
	these, 6197 belonged to the Establishment, and 8827 to other de-
	nominations.  Of the sitting belonging to the Establishment 4744
	were let or occupied of right, and of those belonging to other de-
	nominations 3881 were let or occupied of right.  The sittings un-
	let or unoccupied of right belonging to the former were 1453, +
	and those belonging to the latter were 4946.  In the memorial
	which certain Voluntaries presented in November 1834 to the Lord
	Chancellor Brougham, on the subject of church accommodation in
	Perth, they set forth that the Establishment sittings were 6094,
	and those of the Dissenters 8693; that the unlet sittings in the
	Establishment were 2172 at least; and those in the dissenting
	places of worship 4321.  I have not access to know whether the
	number of their unlet sittings has diminished or increased, since
	the presentation of the memorial.  But there can be no doubt,
	that, assuming its averment to be correct, the let sittings in the
	Established churches have 'made an increase since then of 719.
	In point of fact, the let sittings in the Established churches have
	considerably increased since the year 1835.
	  The number of unlet sittings in five of the churches, East, West,
	Middle, St Paul's, and St Stephen's is certainly considerable.
	But that can easily be accounted for.  St Stephen's is entirely for

	   + It may be proper to remark, that though no sittings be appropriated to the
	poor in the Established churches, many of them get access, througn sufference, to those
	that are unlet.  Thus a considerable number of the poor are accommodated.
