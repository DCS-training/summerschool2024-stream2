which seems to have served as a rule for the presbytery in
his cause.  The marches however seem to have been altered
since that time; though it is probable there was no legal au-
thority for the alteration.  It would not maintain above two
cows and their followers.

   School.-The teacher does not undertake Latin:  but no
man can be more attentive, and few are more successful, in
so far as he professes.  The average number of scholars is 100.
The salary is 150 merks Scots; the fees of teaching are about
10 l.  There is no yard attached to the school.  The heritors
are handsomely acquiescing in a petition to the court of sup-
ply for 50 merks augmentation to the salary; and what will
the emoluments amount to when this is granted?  This will
be very inadequate after all: but the heritors having done
this, will be admitted to have done as much as the law can
possibly demand of them; and if there be any thing wanting
after this, the defect must be in the law itself.
   The law is not defective, however, if we attend to the true
spirit of it.  Statute law fixes a salary; and consuetudinary
law settles the fees of teaching.  These different sources of
emolument, when wisely adjusted, have good effects:  the sa-
lary engages a respectable teacher; the fees encourage him to
be diligent.  Such was the constitution which our forefathers
planned out for our parochial seminaries; and so long as the
law retained its true spirit, the wisdom of this plan was seen
in its effects.  That spirit is now lost; and instead of it, we
have only the dead letter.
   I have in view the Act of Endowment, 6 to Gul.  Let any
one take notice of the real value of the merks at that time,
and say what proportion they bear now.  Did Parliament in-
tend the real value of the merks, for our public teachers, or
the nominal value?  It would cast dishonour upon the legis-
