eagles, in Perthshire, lineally descended from Duncan Earl of
Lennox, and in consequence of this connection, the valuable
estates of the Gleneagles family now belong to the Earl of Can-
perdown. Admiral Duncan entered the naval service under Cap-
tain Robert Haldane, his relative, but was soon removed to the
ship of Captain, afterwards Lord Keppel, under whom he rose
from midshipman to post-captain, to which rank he was promoted
in 1763. After signalizing himself under Keppel, at the Havan-
nah, where he was wounded, under Rodney at Cape St Vincent,
and under Lord Howe in 1782, where in the Blenheim of ninety
guns he led the larboard divisions of the fleet against the combin-
ed fleets of France and Spain, he was promoted to the rank of
Rear-Admiral of tbe Blue in 1787; and on the breaking out of the
Revolutionary war in 1794, he was appointed by Earl Spencer to
the command ofthe North Sea fleet.
	At this period, a large Dutch fleet was collected in the Texel,
for the purpose of co-operating with General Hoche, who was
waiting the first opportunity of invading Ireland with 40,000 men.
During the arduous and anxious service of watching the motions
of this formidable armament, the mutiny of the Nore occurred,
and gave rise to what will long be remembered as the most criti-
cal period of British naval history. Though surrounded with a
general spirit of determined insubordination, which first commen-
ced in the channel fleet at Spithead, Admiral Duncan, by his per-
sonal intrepidity, combined with the influence of his character
among all classes, succeeded in quelling the mutiny in the Vene-
rable, which bore his flag; and, deserted though he was by every
ship in the fleet except the Adamant, adopted the daring but suc-
cessful expedient of blockading the passage from the Texel with
the two ships, practising, from time to time, the ruse of making sig-
nals, as if his fleet had been in sight, instead of lying ingloriously
inactive in the power of mutineers. This stratagem could not
have lasted long, but it served his purpose till some of his misgtid-
ed feet joined him; and it was his determined and declared reso-
lution never to quit his post, nor permit the Dutch fleet to pass the
narrow channel which he occupied, without the most determined
resistance. On one occasion, information was brought to the Ad-
miral by one of his officers, that the whole of the enemy's fleet
was in motion to force the passage, thus intimating, no doubt, that
his only safety was in flight. Instead of answering, he ordered the
lead to be hove, and, on hearing the depth of water, calmly re-
