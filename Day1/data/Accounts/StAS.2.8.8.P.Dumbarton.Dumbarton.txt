Mr Love died at Dalkeith in 1750, aged fifty-five years. He bad
a most thorough knowledge of the ancient.classics, and possessed
the happy faculty of being able to convey his knowledge to others.
Dr Anderson says that he was "an eminent scholar, an excellent
teacher, and a good inan."
  The Rev. John Freebairn, a native, and for several years minis-
ter of the parish, though not known for any literary production,
was a man possessed of considerable talents. In the General As-
sembly he must have made a good figure, as Henry Mackenzie, in
his Life of John Home, describes him thus: He was "a plain coun-
try clergyman, but of infinite native humour," &c. whose talent
for enlivening a debate by pleasantry, or turning the laugh against
his adversary by sarcasm, not rude, though keen, I have seldom
heard equalled by any debater'whomsoever."
   The late Dr Patrick Colquhoun, the author of a "Treatise
on the. Wealth, Power, and Resources of the British Empire,"
and for some years one of the police magistrates of London, was a
native of Dumbarton. By his will, he left the sum of L.200 Ster-
ling to the minister and elders of the parish of Dumbarton, the
interest of which was to be divided yearly among poor people of
the name of Colquhoun in the parishes of Dumbarton, Cardross,
Bonhill, and Old Kilpatrick, not receiving parochial aid.

  About the beginning of 1837, an enumeration of the population

ous Instruction, &c. The population was then found to have
decreased very considerably, the total amount of the inhabitants
