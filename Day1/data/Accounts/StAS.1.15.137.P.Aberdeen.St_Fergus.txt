the coast several miles, but of unequal breadth.  It produces
abundance of short sweet grass, white clover, wild thyme,
and other herbs, which are thought to contribute much to
that delicacy and fine flavour, for which the mutton fed u-
pon them is remarkable.  Between the links and the sea
there is a range of little hills, mostly clay, all covered with
bent, which, as it is carefully preserved, is still encreasing,
and proves an excellent defence against the blowing of the
sand, which, on a low shore, without such a barrier, would
do very material damage to the pasture ground of the links,
and also to the adjacent fields.

   Sea Coast, Minerals, etc.-The shore in the parish of St.
Fergus forms two segments of a circle; the one, beginning
at the mouth of the Ugie, terminates at the Scotstown Craig,
and the other reaches from this Craig to Rattray-head, the
property of Mr Harvey of Broadland.  The rocks both at
Rattray and Scotstown afford plenty of lime-stone, which at
low water is easily quarried.  At Scotstown as well as at Craig-
Ewan, hard by the mouth of the Ugie, there is abundance
of excellent granite; and, all along the coast, an inexhausti-
ble quantity of shells, which are now used as manure
with great advantage.  From these two rocks of Craig-
Ewan and Scotstown, a very trifling quantity of kelp is made
every second year.

   Fishery, Proprietor,++ etc.-All kinds of fish, found on the E.
coast of Scotland, are caught here in great abundance, such

++The proprietor, upwards of 20 years ago, attempted to establish a fish-
ing town in this parish; and if there were a proper landing place for the
boats, it would be an excellent station for fishers, being so near to Rattray-
head, which has long been esteemed the very best fishing ground for cod and
ling.
