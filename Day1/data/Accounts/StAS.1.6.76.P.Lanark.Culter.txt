   Culter-heights and Culter-sell*, (which last rivals Tinto-
hill in height), partly green, and partly covered with
heath and coarse grass, well adapted to the breeding and
feeding of sheep.-There are 4 pretty large store-farms
in the parish, (though not without a considerable proportion

some years past.  The valued rent is L. 1600 Scotch, and the
real rent nearly L. 1600 sterling.-The number of heritors is
