herring.  They are a dry insipid fish; and are not dis-
covered in any other lake on the west coast, excepting
this and Lochlomond.  This parish has 18 miles of sea-
coast.  Lochfine borders it on one side to the extend of its
whole length.  The shore of this loch is partly flat and
sandy; partly steep and rocky.  Where the land nigh the
sea is low, the shore is flat; where the esa comes close to
the foot of the hills, the shore is high and rocky.  There
are no dangerous sunk rocks on the coast; it is in general
what the sailors call a bold, and consequently a safe shore.
Besides the herring occasionally caught in Lochfine,
there are a few cod and haddocks; but no boat from this
parish is particularly employed in this kind of fishing.-
The quantity of fresh water in Lochfine, from the number
of streams that discharge themselves into it, and its di-
stance from the ocean, renders the sea-ware it produces
almost unfit for kelp.  This manufacture is seldom at-
temped.  The inhabitants manure their lands with such
of it as they can get access to.  The quatity of it that
must be laid on the ground is great, and its substance is
exhausted with it annually for bear and potatoes.  It answers
well for bear; but the potatoes produced by it are of an
inferior quality.-The river Cur annually carries away
several acres of excellent soil.  When swelled in different
parts of its course, it undermines its banks, which tumble
down and are carried away.  It leaves a heap of gravel
on the opposite side, which takes a long tract of years be-
fore it is covered with so much depth of soil as to pro-
duce a crop.  In summer and autumn, by overflowing its
banks, it often does much damage to the hay and corn;
but there is no prospect of a canal being cut for it to pre-
vent this mischief.  The expense of this would be too great
in proportion to the benefit that would be derived from it.
