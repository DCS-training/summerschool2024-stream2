     Statistical Account

   The arable grounds are sown with bear and oats alternate-
ly, and in equal quantities to each, in the isle of Sanday.  In
the isle of North Ronaldshay two-thirds of the arable grounds
are sown with bear, and one-third with oats.  Each house
has a small cabbage garden, for rearing from 400 to 1500 or
2000 cabbages, but there are no cabbages in the fields.  These
islands usually raise more grain than is sufficient for the in-
habitants, and also supply themselves with beef, pork, mutton,
and poultry.  There is usually some bear or bigg, and some
oatmeal exported from these islands, except in years of fa-
mine or great scarcity.  After paying to Sir Thomas Dundas,
as superior, about 30 or 32 chalders bear, and a little oat-
meal, as feu-duties, there is usually exported from the isle of
Sanday one or two small cargoes of 50 or 60 tons each, or
from 400 to 800 bolls bear, besides what is sold in lesser
quantities by the small farmers, which cannot be ascertained,
but is not considerable.  This island also exports or sells u-
sually from 300 to 500 bolls oatmeal annually.  After pay-
ing 4 1/2 or 5 chalders bear to Sir Thomas Dundas as superior,
and also to the proprietor 13 chalders or more as rent, from
the isle of North Ronaldshay, the farmers there sell some bear
and meal in small quantities; which cannot be ascertained,
but is not considerable.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages of these
islands are, 1st, That as they are dry and level, the roads are
never obstructed, even by the greatest rains.  2dly, The isle
of Sanday has two pretty good harbours, that of Kettletost
on the south side, and that of Otterswick on the north side.
3dly, As the shores are flat, with several indented bays, the
sea ware is lodged at different places, which is convenient to
the farmers.  4thly, As the shores shelve by a gentle descent,
they produce more kelp than in many other places, and from
