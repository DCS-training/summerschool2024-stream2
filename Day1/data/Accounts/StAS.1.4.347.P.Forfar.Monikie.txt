years several stone coffins have been found.  In the vicini-
ty to the same place, were found upwards of 6 feet below
the surface of the earth, several trees, oak, fir and birch.
There were also found urns, covered with broad stones, be-
low which were ashes, supposed to have been human bodies
reduced to that state by burning.  To the south of the
Cur-hills were found several heads of deer, and horns of a
very large size, among marl, about 9 feet below the sur-
face.
   Within these 3 or 4 years, there have been 5 or 6 large
neat new houses, and several smaller ones built.  Every
farmer almost has within these 10 years made some addi-

people having fewer objects to excite their industry, were
more idle, and consequently more prosligate.-About 35
years ago, the wages of a ploughman were in this neigh-
bourhood L. 2, 10 s. Sterling; of a carter L. 2; of a female
servant from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 1, 10 s.  At present, a plough-
man is thought good for nothing, who does not receive
L. 7 of L. 8.  The usual wages of female servants re from
L. 3 or L. 4.  About 30 or 40 years ago, a farm which
is now worked by 3 ploughs, having each 4, sometimes on-
