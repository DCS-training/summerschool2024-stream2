     Statistical Account

in this parish.  The parishioners, in general, subscribed a
paper, binding themselves neither to lodge vagrant beggars,
nor give them alms.  Several of the inhabitants were ap-
pointed to act as constables, in apprehending and carrying
them out of the parish; any expences necessary for this pur-
pose were to be paid by the heritors.  At the fame time, the
poor of this place were furnished with certificates, which au-
thorised them to beg within the parish.  The good conse-
quences of these measures were, for some time, remarkable.
Such regulations, perhaps, might not be so suitable for large
towns; but, were they generally adopted in country parishes,
they would, in all probability, have the most salutary effects.
Vagrants would be effectually excluded; the charity of every
parish would be bestowed upon its own poor, and there would
be less occasion for stents and such legal methods of raising
supplies for the poor, as are always burthensome to the public,
and frequently prove the occasion of cruelty and additional
distress, to those objects of sympathy they are intended to re-
lieve.

   School.-In the parish school, the following branches are
taught:  Latin, Greek, French, English, Writing, Arithme-
tic, Book-keeping, and the practical branches of the Mathe-
matics.  The number of scholars, for some years past, has
been from 60 to 90.  The schoolmaster's salary is 11 L. Ster-
ling, subject to the deduction of 3 L. to be divided equally
among the teachers of three small schools in the country, who
are chosen by the people in the neighbourhood, and are en-
titled to this encouragement upon their keeping school, for
4 months in the year.  There are also two private schools in
the town which are well attended.
