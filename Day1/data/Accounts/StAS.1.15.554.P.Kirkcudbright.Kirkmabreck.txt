executed much to his Lordship's satisfaction, though at great
expence The highest mountain in this parish, or perhaps
in the South of Scotland, viz.  Cairnsmoor, is one entire mass
of granite, the altitude of which has never been ascertained,
but which may probably be between 3000 and 4000 feet a-

as a sea port may one day be the means of making it an opulent
place.  The inhabitants in general, though charitable and

Cree falling into St George's Channel, and is navigable for
