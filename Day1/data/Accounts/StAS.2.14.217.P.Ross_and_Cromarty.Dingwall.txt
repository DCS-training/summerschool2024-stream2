nent inhabitants, or occasional visitants, the roe-deer, (the red-
deer is now rarely seen in the district,) the rabbit, the common
hare, the mountain bare (Lepus variabilis,) the weasel, the ermine,
the black, the brown, and the water rats, the shrew, the mole,
the fox, the otter, and the seal. The wild-cat, the polecat, and
the badger, which were formerly common, are now almost extinct
in the district.
  From the sheltered situation of this parish, and the abundance
of wood with which it is covered, it is a favourite resort of the
feathered tribes,-few places of an equal extent affording so great
a variety. There is abundance of game, consisting of partridges,
grouse, black-game, and pheasants. These last have been only
lately introduced, but have multiplied so amazingly fast as to have
become, to the no small annoyance of the farmer, almost as nume-
rous as partridges. Along with these the following are either sta-
tionary residents, or periodical or occasional visitors.
