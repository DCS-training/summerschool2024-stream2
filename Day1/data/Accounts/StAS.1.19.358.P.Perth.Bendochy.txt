practice of farmers to keep cottars, by which means people
a are not railed on the grounds sufficient to perform the work.
They think it more profitable to import them from the
Highlands.  A new cart costs L. 6 Sterling; harnessing for
it costs L. 2, 10 s. An iron-headed plough, and cast metal
mould-board, costs L. 2.  A new harrow costs 7 s.  The
threshing a boll of oats costs the 25th boll.

   Fuel.-Most of the people bring any peats they use from
the moss of Cochridge, in the parish of Kinloch, being seven
hours in going and returning.  Coals from Dundee or Perth
are the chief fuel used by those that have carts to drive
them.

   Bridges.-There was a bridge built over the Isla, on the
road from Cupar Angus to Fort George, by Government,
in 1766.  The arches are five.  The middle arch is 30 feet
above the summer water; and the road over is 15 feet
wide, The road is sometimes impassable, on the south side,
at high floods.  The bridge is built nearly over the only
two natural great stones in the middle of the river, called
the riding stone and the wading stone; and as works of na-
ture outlive those of art, they may shew the place where it
stood after it is gone.  There is another bridge over the
Ardle at Cally, on the same road, and a bridge at Stron,
over the Shee, on another road, both of one arch.  There
is a boat over the Eroch at Cupar-grange for foot people.

   Bendothy.-Bendothy was the parish church of Cupar
Angus before the abolition of Popery.  The church was
then more centrical for the parish than it is at present, The
seats of Keithick, in that parish, stood in the church here
before the late repairs.  There is a stone in this church
upon Nicol Campbell, proprietor of Keithick, son of Do-
nald, abbot of Cupar, and grandson of the Earl of Argyle.
