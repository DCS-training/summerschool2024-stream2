quisite in many families to procure the necessaries of life,
rendered complaints of bad health much less frequent than
usual.
   Some discoveries were made in consequence of the late
harvest and scanty crop of 1782.
   Bear was sown earlier than usual in 1783, that there
might be access to the crop as soon as possible; instead of
sowing that grain as formerly in the month of May, it was
sown in the end of March and beginning of April; the
practice has since continued, and it is thought to be, both
as to the quantity and quality of the grain, an advantage,
when the ground is in good order and free from weeds.
During the month of April, there is a sufficiency of moi-
sture in the soil; but in the month of May, particularly the
latter part of it, when the drought is severe, the greatest
part of the seed often remains in the ground without spring-
ing till the later rains, which frequently do not fall till
the middle or end of July, in consequence of which the crop
is very defective, and unequally ripened; when there is
sufficient moisture in the ground, it is not reckoned too late
to sow bear on the last days of the month of May, but this
is uncertain, and it is of great importance to observe the
proper season for sowing bear, which does not meet with
that attention which it deserves.
   From a course of experiments made by Dr Anderson on
different species of grain of crop 1782, he found that oats
when fresh, though only half-ripened, if once they germi-
nate, will produce as weighty crops as oats fully ripened.
   In this parish there was a field in 1782, which produced
from 20 to 30 bolls of oats, which were not frosted, but
were never fully ripened; they continued always green,
and were cut down in the end of November, with their
colour very little changed.  The greatest part of them was
fold for seed-oats, nearly at the same price with oats fully
