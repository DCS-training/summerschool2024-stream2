thereof been raised from land which in its natural state was of
little or no value.  And it has not only the effect of occasion-
ing a more luxuriant and plentiful, but also a much earlier
crop; a circumstance of great importance in a hilly country
like this, where the harvest is commonly late, and the grain
in danger of being injured by the frost before it comes to ma-
turity.  Another advantage resulting from it is, that it is pecu-
liarly favourable to the growth of clover.  Nay, in this cold cli-
mate, it is absolutely essential to its vegetation.  For it has been
found by various trials, that even on the best and most fertile
spots in this part of the country, it is impossible to raise this
useful plant without the aid of lime; whereas, by employing
this manure, the worst of the arable land may be made to pro-
duce it.  And it is a circumstance worthy of observation, that
so great is the efficacy of lime for promoting its vegetation,
that, by laying a quantity of it on the surface of the most un-
cultivated ground, it cruses white clover to spring spon a-
neogsly.  This circumstance is the more remarkable, as there 
have been many accidental instances of this effect of lime in
the midst of the wildest moors, by the breaking down or over-
turning of the carts employed in carrying it.  And that too,
at so great distance from any other lands where this plant u-
sually grows, as renders it difficult to account how the seed
could have been conveyed; and yet repeated experience has
shewn that lime laid on such land, whether by design or acci-
dent, has uniformly had the effect of destroying the heath or bent,
and occasioning the vegetation of white clover, in great abun-
dance.
   It is proper, however, to observe, that not with standing the
tendency which lime has to meliorate the soil, yet a considera-
ble part of the arable ground in this and the neighbouring pa-
rishes has been much injured by the improper use of it, or ra-
