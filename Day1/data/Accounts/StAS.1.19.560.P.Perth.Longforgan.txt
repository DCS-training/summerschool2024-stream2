this description is taken.  He added, that they were all in a
state of high preservation.  This was accompanied with
another piece of curious information; that, nearly about the
same time, there was found in the parish of Invererity, in
the county of Forfar, just such another pot, containing ex-
actly the same number of the same silver coin, viz. 700 of
Edward I. and four of Alexander.  Upon which he made
an ingenious conjecture, that these deposits, very probably,
had been the wealth of two brothers, who had divided it
