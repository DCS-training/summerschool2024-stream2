markable of the stratified rocks in this district. It is found in the
pits at Holland Hirst, and also at Woodmill, Bedlay, and all along
by Garnkirk Huggenfield, Robroyston, and Cathcart. Near the
Kirkintilloch railway, at Bedlay, it is found in great perfection. It
is, generally in two plies, separated by blaes. The following jour-
nal will afford some idea of the accompanying metals.

  Were I to compare the limestones on the north of the great
Lanarkshire basin, with those on its south-western boundaries, I
would point out the Calderside lime between the parishes of Blan-
tyre and East Kilbride, as corresponding with Millcroft lime, the
Auchintibber as corresponding with the Cumbernauld, but of in-
ferior quality, and the limestones to the west of Kilbride as cor-
responding with the Netberwood lime. There is nothing equiva-
lent to the calm limestone on the south-west of the county of La-
nark. Although this district, therefore, properly speaking, lies at
the bottom of the Lanarksbire coal-fields, still it is connected with
other fields to the east, particularly with the Falkirk coal-fields,
which seems to be cut off from the fields still farther to the east,
by traps, as at Bowden and Cockleroy, which rise out from below
it. Probably the whole district may here be viewed as one of de-
nudation, which has been cleared of all the upper strata, and final-
ly cleared of the waters which overwhelmed it, by the upheaving of
the Campsie and other traps with which it abounds.
   The prices of boring in this district, where the metals are sel-
dom at any great depth, are as follows:
