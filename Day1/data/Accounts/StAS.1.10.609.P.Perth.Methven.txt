     of Methven.

     NUMBER XXXIX.

     PARISH OF METHVEH.

     (County and Presbytery of Perth.-Synod of Perth
     and Stirling.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN DOWE, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE name, in Gaelic, is said to signify the Middle, and,
in that language, the adjective dow or black, is com-
monly added in speaking of it; and the origin of that ap-
pellation was supposed to be, That it was situated nearly in
the middle of the great valley, (or Strathmore,) on the south-
of the Grampian Mountains, which extend from Dumbar-
ton to Stonehaven, and nearly at equal distance from those
mountains, and the ridge of the Ochiils, which there bound
that valley on the south Others contend, that the word
Methven may be interpreted, the Little Mountain.  This
name is not descriptive of the situation of the village, which
lies in a hollow; but in a good measure applies to the fite
of the Castle, which stands, with a dignified appearance on
pretty high ground.  The village, which is now consider-
able, seems to have originated from a collegiate church,
founded before the middle of the 15th century But, it ap-
pears, that the old castle of Methven was of a such earlier
date, and therefore communicated its name to the collegiate
church.
