     Statistical Account

granted in the case of Carnegie and Douglas of Finhaven.
A tumulus was opened here some years ago.  In it were
found several Bones of a remarkably large size.  They were
sent to the Musaeum of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries.
Real rubies have been got on the shore, which were gradu-
ally washed from the rocks.  Some of them were sent to Dr
Black, Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh.
   To the east end of the harbour of Ely, and at a small
distance from it, Wadehaven is situated; so named, it is said,
from General Wade, who recommended it to government
as proper for a harbour.  Other, call it Wadd's Haven.
How it got that name, if the right one, is not known.  It is
very large, and has deep water, in so much that it would
contain the largest Men of War, drawing from 20 to 22
feet water.
