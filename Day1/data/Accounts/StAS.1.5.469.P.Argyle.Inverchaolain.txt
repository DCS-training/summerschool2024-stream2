   Antiquities.-At the S. E. extremity of this parish, upon
a farm called Ardein, there stands an artificial hill, on which
the ancient judges of the country held their courts, and ad-
ministered justice.  On a dry heath, near the shore of the
same farm, and also at Achavuillin in that neighbourhood,
there are many vestiges of graves, some marked by cairns
of stones, others by a single stone at each grave.  A few of
them were opened, and found to contain human bones.-It
is probable, that all these, either burned under the cairns, or
whose graves are marked, by the more simple monument of
a single stone at each grave, were men either of rank and fi-

his ships were driven from their anchors by a storm, and all
the people on board perished.  It is supposed, that the graves
along the Ardein and Achavuillin coast, (being opposite
to the bay of Rothesay), are the dormitories of those dead bo-

young courtiers, who attended the palace of Robert III. at
Rothesay.  The gallant courtiers, coming on a hunting ex-
cursion to this part of the country, were so enamoured with
the charms of the young women they met with, that they
