in the E. than in the W. side.-The oldest records belonging
to the church-session, commence in 1665, when Mr. Strachan
was ordained minister here, by a mandate from the Archi-
bishop of St. Andrew's, and they are continued down to the
year 1694.  From that date, to the year 1727, there are no
records extant.  Since that time they have been regularly 
kept.-There are several quarries in the parish of a reddish
coarse granite,  but scarcely any stones found in the fields that
can be used in building.  In consequence of an act of parlia-
ment 1789, 2 turnpike roads are making here, and toll-bars
have been erected about 3 years ago.  The one from Ar-
broath to Forfar, passes through a part of the parish on the
W. side, for about 4 miles.  The other from Arbroath to
Montrose, on the E. side, for 3 miles.  The act also enjoins
a commutation of the statute-labour at the rate of 24 s. Ster-
ling for each 100 L. Scots of valued rent in the county, and
the sum arising from the above assessment, is appointed to be
laid out on private roads within each respective parish.  The
sum collected out of this parish for the above purpose, a-

this and a part of the last century, was Sir James Wood of
Bonnington, Colonel of the Scotch Fusileers, in the reign of
Queen Anne.  He served in Flanders under the Duke of 
Marlborough, and acquired considerable reputation in his pro-
session.  Letham, once his seat, is half a mile distant from the
church.
