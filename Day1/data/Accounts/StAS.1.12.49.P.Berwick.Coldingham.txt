use of whisky.  There is not a single surgeon in this parish.
The people in general are moderate and healthy; few agues
of late years; fevers and consumptions are the ordinary fatal
diseases here, especially to young women.  Few of the com-
mon people will allow inoculation; they say it is an encroach-
ment upon the prerogative of providence; and it is in vain to
tell them, that prudence is the gift of providence, and that it
is their indispensible duty to use every prudential and ap-
