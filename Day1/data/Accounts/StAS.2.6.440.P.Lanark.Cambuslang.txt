eleventh part. Those belonging to no denomination form up-

	Education.-- Besides the parish school, there are also schools at
Lightburn, Bushyhill, and Silverbank. The parish school has for
many years past been in a very flourishing condition under Mr
Hall. The salary is the maximum, with a good house and gar-
den. Through the liberality of the heritors a considerable addi-

house above it. The following tables, will give an interesting view
of the state of education in this parish.
