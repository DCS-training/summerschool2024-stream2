     of Balmaclellan

by no means deprived of that portion of spirit which is ne-
cessary on occasions to assert their rights.  Since the com-
mencement of the present century, there is no recollection of
any one having suffered capital punishment, or having fallen
under the imputation of any atrocious crime.  There are but
three persons in the parish who have ever served in the army
or navy.  The young men generally adventure in the civil
line, either in the character of mechanics or merchants; of
which last, the most are itinerant in the north of England.
There is no foreigner, or any other than natives of Scotland
at present resident within the parish.

   Authors.-No writers of very eminent genius can be claim-
ed by this parish, if it is denied right to Thomas Gordon, the
celebrated author of the Independent Whig.  This very keen
and acute writer, the severest scourge of the English hierar-
chy, whom the compilers of the Scotch Encyclopaedia erro-
neously state as belonging to Kirkcudbright, was certainly a
native either of this or the neighbouring parish of Kells.
Near branches of his family were settled in both; and it is
not at this day certain, or indeed materials in which of them
he was born.

   Church.-The church and manse of Balmaclellan were
built more than 40 years ago, but have both undergone seve-
ral repairs since that period.  The offices are totally ruin-
ous; they are ordered to be rebuilt the ensuing summer.
The present value of the living is, in money, exactly 75 L
and a glebe valued at 20 L or 25 L a year.  The King is
patron.

   Registers.-So far as can be collected, except for ten years,
there has been no regular public register kept in this parish.
