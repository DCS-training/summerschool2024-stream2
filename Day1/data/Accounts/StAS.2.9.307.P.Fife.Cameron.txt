                  III.-POPULATION.
There are only three persons of. independent fortune resident
in the parish. The population of the parish has been increasing
for the last forty years, and during the forty years before that period
it seems to bav& been decreasing. The cause of the decrease
during that time ap ears to have been the inclosing, and letting
in grass from year to year of a number of farms; and during'the
latter period, the high prices got for agricultural produce c used
a number of them to be let for tillage, and consequently a number
of more bands were required for the cultivation of the land. Theria
have been likewise a good many houses feued in the parish, at West-
field of Radernie, which is another cause of the increase in the
population. The population may be said to be wholly agricul.
tural and resident in the country, as the houses that are collected,
at Denhead, Radernie, and Latbones, can scarcely be termed vil-
laps.
