as were authorised by the association to carry arms for
the destruction of foxes, etc.; and who had been pre-

out of more than 100 persons, who had warrants for
this purpose, not one of them ever trespassed in that
respect.  The whole subscriptions in the 5 parishes a-

continued for 10 years, with so great success, that du-
ring that period there were killed 634 foxes, 44 wild-
cats, 57 pole-cats; and 70 eagles, 2520 hawks and kites;
1347 ravens and hooded crows*; besides all those
which were destroyed by poison, or died of their 
wounds: and sheep were then in perfect safety to pas-
ture at all times and seasons to the very boundary of
where the scheme extended.  Unfortunately, however,
for this county, some of the heritors ( for reasons best 
known to themselves ) withdrew their subscriptions.
The other subscribers were obliged, 8 years ago, to give
up the scheme; the consequence of which is, that the
destruction of sheep has gradually gained ground, and
game of all kinds decreased in the same proportion.  It
is much to be regretted that the scheme was dropped; but
the experiment has sufficiently evinced the following
fact, viz. that is such an extensive track of mountainous
country as the 5 parishes above described, where there is
a great deal of wood, and where foxes and other ver-
min poured deal of wood, and where foxes and other ver-
min poured in from neighbouring countries as moun-
tainous as this, derived such real advantages from

and falcons; the second year, wild-cats, pole-cats, small hawks, and kites,
were added; and the third year, ravens and booded crows were also included.
