   Improvement.-Improvements in husbandry have, within
these last 30 years, made rapid progress in this and the adja-
cent parishes, especially in fallowing their lands, clearing it of
stones, regular rotations of crops, with turnip and grass.
The farmers on the higher grounds have likewise begun to
pay attention to their breed of sheep; and by the crops of
turnip and hay which they now raise, have, in a great mea-
sure, secured their flocks from the fatal effects of an hard
winter.  Within the same period, the mode of living is also
much changed to the better, not only among the farmers,
but even among the lower class of people; to which change,
the feeding of swine, and the habit of eating pork, have con-
tributed not a little.  One farmer has erected a threshing
machine, constructed by Mr Meikle.-Severals of there ma-
chines have been erected in this neighbourhood, and are
found to answer the purpose intended.  One capital improve.
ment, especially upon the higher lands, is still wanted-that
of inclosures.  This gives the country a bleak:  appearance,
and deprives it of that shelter, which might hasten and in-
crease vegetation.  There is almost no wood in this parish,
except about the boule of Dunglas.  The natural wood, with
which it once abounded is, for want of care, almost entirely
destroyed.
