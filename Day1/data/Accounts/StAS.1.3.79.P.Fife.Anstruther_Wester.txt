they accepted the offer, on condition that the kelp should
be burnt at the west end of the town, and only when the
wind blew from the east.

   The harbour does not admit ships of burden; but a little
to the westward is a creek, called Westhaven, which, at no
great expence, might be made an excellent harbour.  Nature
seems to have fitted it for that purpose, as boats can come
into it almost at low water.  It is singularly useful in the fish-
ing season.

   Migratory Birds, etc.-The woodcock, fieldfare, and cur-
liew, visit the coast regularly in the winter, and the Bohe-

on the continent, while the cuckoo's early visit is a sure mark
that fine weather may be soon expected.

   Agriculture.-The rotation most approved by the best far-

wheat, 3 d beans, 4th barley, 5th oats, with grass, 6th hay;
on the light soil, 1st turnips, potatoes, or flax, 2 d wheat or
barley, 3 d oats or drilled-beans, 4th barley with clover, 5th
hay; part of the outfield is pasture for the young cattle.
This plan is pursued with advantage, on a farm of 148 acres,
of which about 50 are outfield.  The largest farm in the pa-
rish is 148 acres, the smallest 70.  Formerly every farmer in
the parish had cottagers besides his hired servants, and the
present farmers have not more servants than their predeces-
sors; hence the cottagers were supernumerarics.  The pa-
