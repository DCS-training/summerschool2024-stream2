sident" sounded well, yet he found that his situation was neither
more profitable nor more respectable than that which his worthy
father had held before him. On one occasion, he wrote to his
friends, that "America was certainly a 'land of promise;' for it
was all promise and nonperformance."
   We cannot refrain from mentioning another eminent man who
was long minister of this parish-the Rev. James Innes, whose me-
mory is still respectfully and affectionately cherished. He was or-
dained in the year 1760, and died in 1821; having been minister
of Yester during the long period of sixty-one years. As he left no
writings behind him, we cannot now form a sufficiently correct
estimate of his powers. Although his talents were not of the
highest order, yet he was remarkably distinguished by his powerful
appeals to the conscience, his unbending integrity, and his unwea-
ried diligence in his Master's work.
   This parish claims a remote connection with Sir Isaac Newton,
who is said to have been a branch of the family of Newton of New-
tonhall in this parish.*

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
   In the last Statistical Account of the parish, we are inform-
ed that the population was much greater about a hundred years
before than at that time. The decrease is attributed "to the
demolition of cottages, and the union of several small farms into
one."


            In 1755, the population was 1091
               1791,                     933
               1801,                     929
               1811,                    1006
               1821,                    1100
               1831,                    1019 viz. 494 males, and 525 females.
   The population at present (1835) is about 1050. The number
of the population may perhaps have been considerably affected by
the improvements in manufactures. Formerly, there were about
twenty weavers in the village of Gifford; but owing to the improve-
ments in machinery, there are at present not more than two or three;
and even these have not constant employment in this branch of
