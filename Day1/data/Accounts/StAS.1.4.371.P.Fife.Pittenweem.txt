a fire engine.  After the working had been long discon-
tinued, Sir John Anstruther, about 20 years ago, erected a
fire engine, and has since that period put out an immense
quantity of coal, and made salt to a large extent.  There
are 9 salt-pans.  The average expence for the coal and salt
working is about L. 50 weekly.  The colliers are all free,
stand engaged by the year, and are paid in proportion to
the work they respectively perform.  A good and labo-
rious collier will earn about 18 s. a-week.

   Population- According to Dr Webster, the number was
939.  At present it is 1157, residing in the town, except 4
families.  Males, 541; females, 616; that is, nearly 30
females for 27 males.  The disproportion between the num-
ber of males and females, may be owing to a numner of
the young men betaking themselves to a seafaring life;
and there being no shipping here, although there is a sea-
port, many of them six the residence for their families at
the places from whence they fail, and so cease to appear on
the parish-roll.  Besides, no manufactures being carried on
in this place and neighbourhood, induces another class of
young men to repair to those towns where manufactures flou-
rish, and to settle there.  The females are generally sta-
tionary.  The average of births is 37, of deaths 25; from
which it appears, that multiplying births by 26, and deaths
by 36, will produce numbers that would fall short of the
actual population.
