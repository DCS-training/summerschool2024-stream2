port, receive larger sums. The highest allowance at present is 3s.
The funds arise -from the collections at the church door, which
may be stated at L. 65; from proclamations which, at 2s. 6d. each,
yield from L. 2 to L. 2, 5s. per annum; and from a voluntary as-
sessment on the part of the landward heritors to the extent of L. 50,
the whole of which, however, has not for some time been realized.
For a year or two, these funds have proved insufficient to meet the
demands made upon them, and the kirk-session have been under
the, necessity of calling upon the heritors to renew their contribu-
tion before ilie expiry of the annual term. On account of the de-
cay of trade, and the consequent lack of employment, pauperism
bas been, for some time, decidedly on the increase. Among many
of the poor, there is very little reluctance to apply for parochial aid.
There are some honourable exceptions; but the old Scottish spi-
rit of independence is gradually disappearing. Instances also oc-
cur of extreme unwillingness to contribute towards the maintenance
of infirm or aged relatives.  As yet, the spirit of beneficence is far
from being dormant in the	breasts of the wealthier classes. The
amount of private charity is considerable ; and subscriptions are oc-
casionally made to meet cases of peculiar destitution. Coals, pro-
cured in this way, are generally distributed in the winter season;
and to the liberality of James Strange, Esq. and his household, by
whom Rossend Castle has for some years been occupied during the
summer months, have the poor been indebted for a seasonable sup-
ply of this necessary article, in the course of the present land two
preceding winters.
JaiL-The jail of Burntisland is neither large nor commodious;
but there are seldom any prisoners.
The following statement of the number of civil and criminal
causes tried by the magistrates from 1820 to 1833 inclusive, is
