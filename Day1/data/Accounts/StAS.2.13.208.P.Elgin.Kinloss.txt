      Much attention has been paid of late to the improvement of
   live-stock, and the style of farming is also far superior to what
   prevailed in former times.  The rotation of cropping generally
   followed is the six-sbift, beginning with green crop, which is fol-
   lowed by barley; then two years' grass, succeeded by wheat; and
   lastly by oats.  A great deal has been done of late in the way of
   draining, ditching, and enclosing.  One enterprising tenant alone
   has expended from L.1500 to L.2000 on such improvements.
   Within the last ten years also, nearly 200 acres have been brought
   into cultivation by industrious and skilful tenants. Of any estate
   in the parish, that of Grange shows probably the greatest change
   for the better.  When it was bought about the year 1800, it con-
   tained 700 acres, of which two-thirds at least were completely
   waste; at present, the whole of that waste is under wood or regu-
   lar cultivation.* Extensive improvements have been made too
   on the barony of Muirtown ; and on the farm of Kinloss, the pro-
   prietor has built as handsome and Commodious a square of offices
   as any in the county.  By planting and taking in waste land, the
   estate of Sir G. Macpherson Grant, Bart. has undergone consi-
   derable change. The march of improvement, however, has still
   room to advance.  No inconsiderable portion of the undivided
   common, now overflown by the sea, might, by embanking, be re-
   claimed, and were a belt of planting carried down from Kinloss
   to Findhorn, on each side of the road, where there is nothing at

<FOOTNOTE>*In many respects, this parish had cause to regret the early death of the late
   amiable and intelligent proprietor, John Gordon Peterkin, Esq. of Grange and Gres-
   hop. he has been'succeeded in the possession of the estate by his sister Mary Anne,
   only surviving child of the deceased James, Peterkin, Esq., and a lady distinguished
   by many virtues.  She married Major Peter.  Grant of Invererne.  The parochial
   funds for the relief'df'the poor, and all contributions to charitable and religious ob.
   jects, meet on every occasion with the generous support of the family.
