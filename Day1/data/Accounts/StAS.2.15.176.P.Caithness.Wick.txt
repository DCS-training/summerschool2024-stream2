       	       It must not be supposed that all these culprits were from the
               parish of Wick. The jail is not for the parish of Wick, but for
               the whole county of Caithness.
                   The jail was built in 1828, at an expense of L. 1200, the greater
               part of which was defrayed by the burgb.  It is sufficient for the
               county. Attention is paid to the health of the prisoners. It is
               governed according to act of Parliament.  The Rev.  David Mit-
               chell, Missionary in Pulteneytown, has been appointed chaplain,
               with a salary of L. 20 a-year.
                   Fairs.-The following fairs are held within this parish; Skitten
               Market, at Kilrnihister, on the first Tuesday of March; Wick
               Market, on the first Tuesday after Palm Sunday; Fair of Wick
               in June.  All these are for cattle.  Margaretmas, at Hill of
               Wick, on the Tuesday after the 20tb of July, for cattle, and the
               hiring of persons for the harvest; and Fergusmas,* at Wick, in
               the end of November, for cattle.
                   Inns and Public-Houses.-Of these there are in Wick and Louis-
               burgh, 22; Pulteneytown, 23; the landward part of the parish,
               9 ; total, 54.
                   Instead of this appalling number, every person acquainted with
               the circumstances of the parish must admit, that a dozen were
               more than enough for all the necessities of the district.  An ex-
               cess of public-houses is one of the most frightful curses which can
               befall a community.  Their effect upon the morals and comfort

<FOOTNOTE> The frequent use of the termination was, in the names of fairs and term days in
               Caithness, shews the deep hold which Popery had taken of the district.  Besides
               Margaretmas and Fergusmas, mentioned above, there are in the county Colmsmas,
               the term on the 20tb of June; Petermas, 29th June, O.S.; Georgemas, 15th July,
               O. S.;  Marymas, 15th August, O. S. ; Lukemas, first Tuesday of October, O.S.;
               Manamas, or Magnusmas, first Tuesday of December, O. S.; Tustimas, fourth Tues-
               day of November, O. S.; and a number more masses.
