reason to believe, from the concurring report of all the very
old people with whom I have been talking on the subject,
as well as from other circumstances, that the present num-
ber is at least one fourth more than it was about 70 years
ago.
   Agriculture has made considerable progress during that
period, and in proportion to its progress, a greater number
of hands were needed to carry it on.  lndustry and fruga-
lity kept pace with this progress; as the inhabitants were
gradually enlightened, so they were gradually awakened,
and incited to action; their necessities and wants grew
greater as they multiplied; this put their invention to the
trial, and their wants and invention introduced several em-

strangers before, and for which they did not care; for truly
I believe that they knew no want, and felt no necessity for
diligence and activity before that period.  These circum-
stances furnished employment, and employment made room
for hands; and numbers of hands that could live in idle-

and avail themselves of it.  Hence a variety of implements
and utensils for husbandry, etc. which were very few and
simple before, were afterwards found necessary; and of
course and by consequence, artists and tradesmen, who were
also very scarce before that period, to make them.  Hence
a small farm, that was wont to be worked by very few
hands, cannot now be wrought to any purpose, without
some additional hands; for the rent being formerly very
low, and other necessaries easy to be got, very little
pains was necessary to live and keep credit by that farm,
But now the case being altered, there is a necessity for rai-

the family can be supported, credit kept, and all necessary
