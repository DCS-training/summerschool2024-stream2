   Agriculture, etc.-Extensive plantations have been for
several years, and are still carrying on by Mr Fergason of
Raith.  There being in this parish about 143 acres accu-

The number of horses, cows, cattle and young beasts may
be about 1250.  The acres in the parish are about 3165.
In corn 530, in turnip and cabbage 85, in potatoes 84, in
wheat 85, in barley 250, in pease 176, in sown grass 164,
