end of it, lies at a great distance from all medical assistance.

   Rivers, Fish and Lakes.-The rivers in this parish are the
Shin and the Cassly, and the upper part of the parish is separated
from that of Kincardine, by the river Ockel.  The Shin issues
from Lochshin in the parish of Lairg.  It falls into the Kyle,
or Frith of Tain, at Invershin, 5 miles above the church of
Criech.  The salmon on the river Shin are very large, and,
after being on the river for some time, turn brackish.  At
an average, a salmon barrel contains about 20 or so.  There
is, on this river, a cascade of a considerable height, and a deep
pool below, into which the water falls from the rock.  The fish,
leaping to get over the cascade, fall back into a creel, or basket,
and are killed.  Most of the fish were in use to be caught in
this way.  The cascade is called the Linn.  Cruives are erected
this season on the river, which runs from N. to S.  The
length of the river from the S. to the Kyle, is about 5 miles.
The Cassly, issuing from the hills on the north weft of the pa-
rish, runs S. and falls into the Kyle at Rosehall.  The salmon
on this river are small and white, and very tender.  The
river Ockel issues in part from the high hill of Or-bein-mor-
Assint, whence it runs eastward, and falls into the Kyle, near
the place where the Cassly joins it.  The salmon on this river
are large and good.  There are trouts in all of those waters.
The fishermen can easily distinguish the salmon of all there
rivers, as well as of other two that fall into the Kyle, from
those of the Kincardine side.  There are several lakes in the
parish that abound in trouts, some of which are of a very
good quality.  The largest lakes are Loch-migdol and Loch-
elst, each about 2 measured miles long.  There are many
others of a lesser size.
