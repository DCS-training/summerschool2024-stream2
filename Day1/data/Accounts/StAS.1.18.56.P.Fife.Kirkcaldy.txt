brandy.  Far down in the present century, it was the prac-
tice, even among citizens of some character, to take a regular
whet in the forenoon, and most commonly to spend the eve-
ning in the public house.  For a considerable time this prac-
tice has been given up; and the habit of drinking spirits to
excess is confined to a few, and these generally of the very
