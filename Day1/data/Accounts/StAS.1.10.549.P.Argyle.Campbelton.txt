it contains 200.  To each merk-land may be allowed, at an
average, about 25 head of black cattle, 25 of sheep, and 6 of
horses.  The breed of horses and cows is far from being
good.  The sheep, which are generally of the native white
faced kind, are small, but their wool is fine.  They are com-
monly houses at night, which keeps them dirty, and subjects
them to diseases.  In summer, especially, they are, from this
practice, liable to be infested with a kind of worm or maggot;
a distemper which was prevented or cured by a decoction of
oak bark, or of broom and stale urine, when they had not
the convenience of oil, tar, and brimstone, or the juice of
tobacco.  From the mildness of the climate, if flocks, at least
of the hardy native race, were allowed to lie out, the smear-
ing practiced in other places could here be dispensed with.

   Produce.-The produce of the arable land consists of bear,
oats, potatoes, beans, and sometimes a little pease.  Potatoes
are the principal food of the bulk of the people, for three
fourths of the year, and therefore they are raised in great
abundance.  Next to potatoes, the chief attention of the far-
mer is directed to the raising of bear, on which he depends
chiefly for his rent, as he does on potatoes for his subsistence.
A considerable quantity of flax is also raised, but little or no
hay.  When somewhat more of the land shall be inclosed,
and sufficiently drained, the system of husbandry will proba-
bly be changed.  As the greater part of the last leases were
given by the Duke of Argyll, on condition of making cer-
tain improvements, instead of paying an augmentation of
rents, there is reason to hope that the face of the country
will soon assume a better appearance, and that this noble
proprietor, and others who may be induced to follow his
example, will be encouraged to pursue, for some time, so be-
neficial a system.  His Grace, some years ago, encouraged a
