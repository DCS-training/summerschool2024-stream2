interest of their country, went into it, with a view to bring
its influence to the self of experiment.  They were disap-
pointed.  The female became pregnant, and the whole
neighbourhood sceptics.  Though the miraculous excellen-
cies of this island have now ceased, they are amply com-
pensated to the proprietor by a natural one.  Not a patch 
in the Highlands is fitted to produce beef or mutton of a
superior quality.
   The chapel of church of Kilmory-knap seems to have
been the most considerable in South knapdale.  Its walls
are almost entire.  A beautiful obelisk, or cross, stands on
the north side of the burying-ground.  It consists of a sin-
gle stone, neatly cut, and twelve feet in height:  On one
side is represented a slag-chace; and on the other, the cru-
cifixion of our Saviour, suspending a balance.  There is
also an inscription, which the compiler of this account had
not time to examine.  It is said to be in the Hebrew or
Gallic character.
   Kilduslan is a small chapel on the shore of Lochgilp.  It
exhibits nothing striking; and tradition has forgot to inroll

   About 25 years ago, the tenants of Ceannlochcaolisport
discovered six or seven stone coffins in a potato-field, not
far from the place where the chapel formerly flood.  They
were of different sizes; but all of them too short to contain
a human body.  They were placed in the direction of east
and well, and all empty, except one, in which a small frag-
ment of human bone was found.  Perhaps the custom of 
burying the dead, with the head towards the west, was an-

coffins may have been placed by the Druids, as receptacles 
for the ashes of their dead.  The bone discovered may have
been rendered less perishable by a partial calcination.  It
