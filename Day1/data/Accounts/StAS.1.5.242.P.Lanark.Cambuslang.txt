     Statistical Account

the first kirk erected here was dedicated to St Lan or
Launus.

   Situation and Extent.-Cambuslang is situated in the
county of Lanark, the Presbytery of Hamilton, and the
Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  It is something less than 3
miles square, and may be stated as containing about 8
square miles in superficial extent.  The kirk, which is 5
miles S. E. from Glasgow, and 6 miles W. from Hamil-
ton, is nearer to the N. W. corner, than to any other
boundary of the parish.

   Surface and Soil.-Though beautifully diversified with
hill and dale, there are no high grounds in the parish, ex-
cept Dichmount and Turnlea hills, which form a ridge a-
bout half a mile broad, and extending near two miles from
E. to W.  From this ridge, which is nearer the southern
than the northern side of the parish, the ground declines
gently, and with many beautiful swellings, to Clyde on
the N. and to Carlder on the S. and E.  In so consider-
able a tract of country, there are different kinds of soil.
Upon the ridge just now mentioned, and the adjacent
fields, the soil is thin and gravelly.  Along the banks of
Clyde, it is partly a light loam, and partly a light sand;
but by far the most common, is a clayey soil, with a till
bottom.

   Rivers, etc.-Clyde, which bounds this parish for near
3 miles, is from 200 to 250 feet broad.  It is a fine
stream, when so full of water as to cover the whole chan-
nel.  Some high spring tides come up to the confines of 
this parish; but in general they do not reach them by
more than a mile.  Clyde overflows its banks, at an ave-
rage, between three and four times yearly.  In floods, the
