it makes for the shore of its own accord, and the rest follow ;
so that out of a whole shoal, hardly one escapes.  They are
commonly from 15 ta 20 feet long, and their blubber yields
about a barrel of oil, each.  For some years, they have disconti-
nued their visits.
   Produce.-The average gross amount of produce annually raised
in the parish, so far as could be ascertained, may be estimated as
follows:

   Grain of all kinds raised in Tiree,	L.2582	Do. in Coll, L. 1250
   Potatoes and other plants,	              4424	     -          1600
   Hay, whether meadow or cultivated,	   215	     -           160
   Flax, or other crops for manufactures,                  -            15

   Manufactures.-The only article of manufacture entitled to no-
tice is the kelp, which, however, may now be spoken of as one of
those things which have been.  At one time, about 500 tons of it
were made in Tiree, which employed at least one-half of the
adult population during the season.  Several farms not only paid
their rent with kelp, but in some cases even got back considerable
balances ; for the proprietor was then in the practice of allowing
the tenants a certain price for their kelp, and sending it himself to
market.  The manufacturing price was from L. 2 to L.2, 10s. per
ton.  The quantity has been gradually diminishing, and since 1837
none has been made.
   The island of Coll formerly produced about 150 tons a-year, and
employed 140 adults.  The manufacturing price varied from L. 2
to L.3, 10s., according to the ruggedness of the shore, and other
difficulties.  The quantity last made there amounted to 80 tons;
and for the last four or five years, the manufacture of it has
entirely ceased.
   Shipping.-In Tiree there are 4 decked vessels, carrying from
twenty to forty tons burden, which are sometimes employed in
carrying country produce to market, but generally look out for
employment elsewhere; 20 open, or half-decked boats, of from
six to twenty tons, which are chiefly engaged in ferrying cattle,

<FOOTNOTE>The fish cured by the Aberdeenshire fishermen is included.  As to the fish
annually consumed at home, I found it impossible to ascertain the quantity or value.
After consulting several persons of experience, I am of opinion it will be a very mo-
derate estimate to allow an average of 1,.1, 5s. for each family in Tiree, = L.960,
and 15s. for each family in Coll, = L. 192, which might be added to the above.
