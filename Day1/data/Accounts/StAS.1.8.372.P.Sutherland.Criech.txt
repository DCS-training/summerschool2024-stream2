   Ferries and Roads.-There are no bridges in this parish
but there are 4 or 5 ferries between it and that of Kincardine,
which are crossed by cobbles, or yawls, and boats, that can fer-
ry over two horses each, or more.  The people in this parish
and neighbourhood, have been amused from time to time
with the hopes, that a bridge was to be built over the Kyle,
at Culrain, about four miles above the church of Criech, at
the expence of government.  It would be of great advantage
to the inhabitants of this district in particular, besides the
emolument that would accrue to the community at large, if
the public road around the ferries were brought this way by
a bridge.  Such a bridge would be particularly convenient for
drovers; all the cattle driven to the south from Sutherland,
Caithness, and Lord Reay's country, except the parish of
Assint, having hitherto been obliged to cross the Kyle by
swimming; which, when the weather is bad, and the Kyle
much swelled by rains, hurts the cattle greatly, especially
when the night following proves cold.  Sometimes they
refuse to swim, in which care they mutt be ferried over
by the cobble.  The people pretend to foretell, whether they
shall have a good market or not, by their readiness to swim.
The roads, in this extensive parish, are very bad; statute
work is but seldom performed, which may be owing to this
circumstance, that few heritors reside in it.  The roads might
easily be made good, as the bottom is hard and gravelly.

stone, 3 feet long and 4 feet broad, marked distinctly with the
