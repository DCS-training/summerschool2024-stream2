bited houses. Families, 386; whereof 88 are chiefly engaged in
agriculture, and 253 in trade, manufactures, and handicraft. Houses
building, 1; houses uninhabited, 12. The latter are chiefly upon
the estate of Tulloes, as the proprietor has taken great part of that
estate into his own hands.
	The following is a list of males and females born, and regis-
tered in the parish books, during the 13 years, from 1st January
1819 to 1st January 1832.

	From this table it appears, that, although the number of female
births sometimes equals, and sometimes exceeds, that of males,
yet, in a course of thirteen years, the male births exceed those of
females by thirty-six. Had the comparison been carried through
a greater number of years, the excess would have been much
greater. We believe it to be a fact over all the world, that the
number of males born always exceeds that of females. But, on the
other hand, during the census 1831, there were living in the parish
712 males and 801 females,--the excess in the number of females
over that of males being 89. To account for this, it may be ob-
served, that some of our young men went to the army and navy, and
never returned; some went to the merchant service in distant ports;
some have found employment in distant parts ot the country; and
some have lately emigrated to America, carrying no females with
them. Thus, as men are engaged in more hazardous employ-
ments than women, it seems to be the intention of Divine Provi-
dence to provide for this by the superior number born.
