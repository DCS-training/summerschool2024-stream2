now engaged in a process of division and excambion of their
property lands, which were formerly all run-ridge.  This,
when finished, will add much to their advantage, and to the
beauty of the country.

   Rockhall Moat.-There is a moat in the parish, called
Rockhall Moat, of which there are many in this part of
the country, and of the most remote antiquity.  This is a
most beautiful mount of earth, perfectly round, and termi-
nating in a sharp top; it is larger than many of them, and
is very entire.  It stands on the side of a ridge of hills, which
separates Annandale from Nithsdale, and overlooks an ex-
tensive plain on the foot of the river Nith, part of Galloway,
and all the Solway Frith.  As to the use of these moats, it
is generally agreed, that the people met on them to make
laws, and administer justice.  To this day, the Twelve Keys
of the Isle of Man, who are their parliament, meet on one
of those mounts, in the open air; and some of the court-
houses in England are called the mote, or mute, or moot-hall.
The public courts among the Saxons were called Witten-mote,
or Witlen-a-gemote, which was the original of parliaments in
England, according to Rapin.

   Soil.-The soil is very rich and fertile on the banks of the
rivers.  There are three, viz. Kinnel, Ae, and Dryte, that
join the Annan, all within a mile of one another in this
parish.  These lands are exceedingly rich, but they are
sometimes overflowed in the winter, which adds to their fer-
tility.  The lands on the rising ground are good, and very
capable of improvement, and raise good crops, when proper-
ly managed.  It is all arable, though not yet wholly in til-
lage.
