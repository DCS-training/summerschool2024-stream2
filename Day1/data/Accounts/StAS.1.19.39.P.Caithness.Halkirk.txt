   Commerce and Traffick.-The principal subjects of com-
merce in this parish, as already observed, are the articles
just now mentioned.  As to horses, very few of them could
be spared for sale, if those who rear them had patience to
keep them until they would be fit for work, etc.  There-
fore they sell them at two years old, as mentioned above,
at low prices, and buy others, fit for work, at very high
rates; so that there is no gain, but rather great loss by this
branch of commerce.  As to black cattle, I believe, that,
communibus annis, about 1000 of them are sold between the
butcher and the drover.  As to victual, I believe they can
export, at an average, in good years, about 1800 bolls, and
support themselves; but this export, as I am informed, is
not so much as it was in former years.  The decline in
crops, the increase of people notwithstanding the improve-
ments made of late years, and the bear consumed by whisky
and distillation, may well account for this circumstance.
As to whisky, I believe 2-3ds of it is consumed in the
country, a great part of these 2-3ds in this same parish, and
consequently, that scarcely 1-3d of that liquor is exported.
Not many years ago, there were no less than 13 or 14 small
distilleries in this parish, and on the near confines of it;
at present, since the late act, there are only 4, which I think
is enough, considering all the good that is reaped from
them.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent is L. 3314: 7: 8
Scotch, I suppose, at the conversion of L. 4 Scotch per boll.
