houses of Finzean and Ballogie.  The former is an old house,
built in the form of three sides of a square; the latter is, to a
great extent, a modern building.  Both are comfortable mansion-
houses, but claim no particular notice from their: architecture.
The woods and plantations around each, are extensive and thriving,
and add much to the beauty of the parish.

                      III.-POPULATION.
   Previous to Dr Webster's report, no accurate statement of the
population is on record.  The population then given is 1126.
In 1791, when a correct account of it was taken by the last in-
cumbent of the parish, it was 1253.  From this number the popula-
tion gradually rose till 1827, when it was 1568.  Since that period
it has been receding.  By the census of 1831 it was 1487, and, in
1837, it was still lower.  The cause of the advance and subsequent
decrease was the same, viz. illicit distillation of whisky.  While
this infamous and demoralizing practice prevailed, population in-
creased through the facilities by which families were maintained
among, the hills and valleys on its profits.  But no sooner was
this system put down, than the effect appeared on population.
Fewer marriages than formerly now take place, and a considerable
number of families, formerly supported by illicit distillation, have
been obliged to remove to towns and other parishes: a good
many families, also, have emigrated to America.  This is entirely
a rural parish, there being no village of any kind in it.
   The population may be divided as follows: *

   The number of marriages at present subsisting in the pa-
rish, inclusive of widowers or widows, 259; of these, 245 have
had families, 14 have had no family; besides these, 11 have
had no family in their present marriage, although one of the
parties had a family by a former marriage.  In the above, ten
marriages have had only one child, and eleven marriages have
bad only two children.  The average number of children in
a family is about 4 1/2; proportion of those marriages produ-

<FOOTNOTE>The population, as taken by census 1841, was 1313, exhibiting a decrease from
the census 1831, of 174.  The cause of the decrease is that stated above, along with
the junction of small farms into larger.
