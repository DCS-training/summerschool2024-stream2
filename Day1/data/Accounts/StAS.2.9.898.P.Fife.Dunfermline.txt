	800.  It cost L.1673, of which were raised by subscription L.1002,
	and received from the General Assembly's Extension Fund L.411;

	manse or garden.  Present minister, Rev. Charles Marshall, ad-

	   From 1839 till the summer of 1843 there was another quoad
	sacra church, named the Canmore Street Church, in connection
	with the Establishment, and formerly in connection with the Ori-
	ginal Burgher Synod, established in 1799.  Its last minister,

	the congregation have connected themselves with other churches.
	   Free Churches.-There are at present (January 1844) three

	3. The Abbey, (or as at first called, Abbey and Canmore Street
	congregations, from most of the elders and many of the people of
	the latter having joined the former.)
