                                PARISH OF DUNROSSNESS.

                      PRESBYTERY OF LERWICK, SYNOD OF SHETLAND.
                          THE REV. DAVID THOMSON, MINISTER.
  
      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   THIS parish occupies the greater part of the southern peninsu-
la of Shetland.  It includes the parishes of Sandwick and Cun-
ningsburgh, now annexed to it; also the Fair Isle.
   Mineralogy.-There was an attempt made to work a mine of
copper on Fitfill, some specimens of the ore having been sent to
the southward, and having attracted the attention of a mining com-
pany.  Some shafts were also sunk at Sand-lodge, in Sandwick pa-
rish.  But these attempts, not proving successful, have been aban-
doned for many years.
                             II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   There was a temporary residence in this parish for the Earls
of Orkney, when they came to the country; but the castle of
Sculloway was their principal dwelling.
   Parochial Registers.-Parochial registers are kept, of the bap-
tisms and marriages of persons connected with the Established Church.

                               IV.-INDUSTRY
   Dunrossness is fertile in the production of bear or big, and black
oats; considerable quantities of both, and also of potatoes of good
quality, are annually carried to Lerwick, and sold to the inhabi-
tants there, at reasonable prices.  The standard weight of the
lispund, of Norwegian origin, is 32 lbs. English; but it is the
custom to give 36 lbs. or more.
