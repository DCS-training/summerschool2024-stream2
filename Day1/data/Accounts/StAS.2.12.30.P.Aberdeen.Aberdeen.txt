this resolution by a visit which they had shortly before received from
some of the Reformers of the south.
   In 1567, the Provost of Aberdeen, writing to excuse his non-at-
tendance at the General Assembly called for the 26th of July,
expresses the mind of the town as follows: "It shall please your
wisdomes understand and most assuredly believe us, professors of
the Evangell of the Kirk within the burgh of Aberdeen, to be of
ane minde, and be the grace of God to continue, to the mainte-
nance of the furthsetting of the glory of God, teaching of the
true Evangell, and sustentation of the Ministers, with help unto
the poore, and unto the tyme your wisdomes with the nobilitie find
and order universall for the ministrie, we shall, for our own part,
God willing, sustaine our minister, so that of reason be shall have
no cause to plaint, and to the poore after our power doesemblablie
as uther burroughs shall take order." *
   At the commencement of the Reformation in Aberdeen, a mis-
sionary (or assistant to the minister) seems to have been employ-
ed, as may be gathered from the following entry in the council re-
cords of 11th October 1560: "The eounsell ordanis David Mar,
thesaurer, to deliver Johne Brabaner ane garmound of cleithing of
Frensche or Flanders blak, that is to say, bonnet, goune, coitt,
hoiss, and doublatt, for his labours, cair, and diligens taine in tymes
bygaine, in preching, teching, and administratione of the sacra-
mentis, without ony recompense."
   Mr Heriot was greatly respected for his worth and usefulness,
and on his death in 1574 he was succeeded by Mr John Craig,
who had been for nine years the colleague of Knox in Edinburgh,
an afterwards minister at Montrose.
   In 1579, Episcopacy was introduced into the Church of Scot-
land, and David Cunningham was installed the first Protestant bi-
shop of Aberdeen.  In the struggles which afterwards took place
for the abolition of that form of church government, as well as in
the opposition made by the country to the ecclesiastical proceed-
ings, in general, of James and his descendants, the citizens of
Aberdeen, influenced by their feelings of loyalty, and under the
guidance of their teachers, seem generally to have been less zeal-
ous than their countrymen in other quarters.  Stevenson having
mentioned, (in his History of the Church and State of Scotland)
the prevalent, feeling in favour of the Covenant, makes the follow-
ing exceptions:-"1st, Papists; 2d, Courtiers who had no
