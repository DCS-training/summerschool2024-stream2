health, morals, and usefulness of mankind, especially when
taken too often, or to excess.  There are six heritors in the
parish of Larbert, viz. Sir Michael Bruce, Bart. Colonel
Dundas, Mr Bruce of Kinnaird, Mr Strachan of Woodside,
Mr Caddel of Banton, and Mr Miles Riddell of Larbert;
and there in Dunipace, viz. Mr Morehead of Herbertshire,
Mr Johnston of Denovan, and Mr Spottiswood of Dunipace;
each of whom keeps a four wheeled carriage.  It is worthy
of being recorded, to the honour of these gentlemen, that
during the great scarcity in 1782 and 1783, they voluntarily
raised the assessment upon their property from 20 s. to 30 s.
Sterling on the 100 L.  Scotch of valued rent, for the support
of the poor; besides importing grain, which they fold be-
low the market price to all who applied for it.  Mr Bruce
of Kinnaird, the famous Abyssinian traveller, has lately erec-
ted and elegant monument of cast metal, over the vault
wherein his lady and eldest son are interred, which is much
admired by strangers.  There have been 40 houses built
within these 10 years, besides one gentleman's seat in the
parish of Larbert, and only four taken down within that 
period.  Servants wages are very high in comparison of what
they were formerly, being about 10 L. per annum, besides
their board; so that between the increase of rents, and the
high rate of wages, the husbandman is often put to great dif-
ficulties.  Such as employ cottages seem to be easier, and
better served.
