   Population, etc.-About 15 years ago, when the mini-
ster personally took the last list of them, the number of
examinable persons in this parish were 1248, of which 930
were in Portree, and 318 in Raasay.  Since that time the
increase has been considerable: After the exactest inqui-
ry, the whole number of souls appears to be 1980.  There
being no parish register, the births and deaths cannot be
well ascertained; and as to marriages, they may be reckoned
at an average 10 every year.  Of persons above 90 years old,
there are 2; between 70 and 90, 22.  The number of wea-
vers in the parish is four; of weaveresses, 12.  There are
blacksmiths, 5 carpenters, 8 tailors, and 3 shoe or brog-
makers; but the generality of the people make their own
brogs.  There may be reckoned six petty merchants, be-
sides the innkeeper of Porttee, with whom it has been al-
ways customary to keep a large assortment of hardwares,
grocery goods, and fundry other things necessary for the
use of the country.
   Although in the course of the seven last years, several ves-
sels went from Sky to America with emigrants, very few
left this parish.  The subdivision of lands, (a method gene-
rally prevailing), at the same time that it makes the people
poorer, on account of their little progress in agricultural
improvements, evidently helps to increase the popula-
tion; and the preservation of many lives is owing to the
practice of inoculating that now universally prevails.

   Agriculture.-Portree, like the far greatest part of this
island, is much less adapted by nature for agriculture than for
pasture, and seldom, unless in very good years, supplies it-
self with a sufficiency of provisions.  Yet, though the soil is
not very fertile or rich, it might with proper management
be made to produce more plentiful crops.  But the general
run of farmers are so prejudiced in favour of old customs,
