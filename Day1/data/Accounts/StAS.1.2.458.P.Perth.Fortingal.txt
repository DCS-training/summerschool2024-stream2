are now as honest, and as strict a set of people, in these mat-
ters, as any in the kingdom.
   In the year 1754, the country was almost impassable.  There
were no roads, nor bridges.  Now, by the statute-labour, we
have got excellent roads, and 12 bridges.  In a few years, we
small have other two, which is all that could be desired.  The
people contribute chearfully and liberally to build them, and
this preserves many lives.
   At the above period, the bulk of the tenants in Ranoch had
no such thing as beds.  They lay on the ground, with a little
heather, or fern, under them, One single blanket was all

per annum, and upwards, and the people have fulness of
bread.

poor man, who had a small farm hard by him, by this means,
with a boll of meal for every mouth in his family, pass the
whole year.
   The circumstances, which have occasioned the greater wealth
and abundance of the present times, are the planting of so
many potatoes, the advance in the price of the cattle and sheep,
