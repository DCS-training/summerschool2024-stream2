from 18 to 26 bolls of small coal or culm.  The price of the
coal is about 8 d. per boll, when laid down at the pan.  Two
men are employed in working a pan; their joint wages from
17 s. to 20 s. per week.  From the time the salt is drawn
till it is sold, the waste by lying in the girnel is computed at
1 bushel in 10.  The better the salt is made, the waste is the
less.  When it is conveyed by land, a high wind occasions a
greater waste than a moderate rain.  Three bushels in 40
were formerly allowed for waste, when it was carried coast-
ways.  A late act of Parliament reduces the allowance to 1 in
40.  The original coast of a salt pan amounts to about 300 L.
Sterling; and once in 3 years it costs about 40 L. for repairs.
The price of salt at prevent, duty included, is 3 s. per bushel.
The average made in this parish, during the 5 last years, is
10,750 bushels 4 gallons per year.
   A manufacture of stone ware is carried on a little to the west
of the church.  It commenced about 40 years ago, and belongs
to Messrs. Cadell.  White stone ware, and cream coloured
ware, (of late the loft chiefly) are manufactured.  About 40
men, and upwards of 30 boys, are employed.  The wages
of the men are from 6 s. to 15 s. per week.  Some of them,
when working by the piece, earn more than 15 s.  The wa-
ges of the boys are from 1 s. to 2 s. per week.  The boys are
taken at 8 years of age, and continue till they are 14 or 15,
when they are either bound as apprentices, or go to other
occupations.  About 24 tons of coals are consumed per
week; the pride is 5 s. 6 d. per ton, when laid down at the
work.  The clay used in the manufacture is brought from
Devonshire, the slint from Gravesend; white and red lead
from London, Hull, and Newcastle.  The price of the clay
is 10 s. per ton, freight 14 s. per ditto; the price of the flint
is 18 s. and 20 s. per ton, freight 8 s. per ditto.  Fire clay is
found in great plenty in the neighbourhood.  This manu-
