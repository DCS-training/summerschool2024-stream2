   It is necessary, in this Statistical Account, to pass over the
different turns which trade has taken in Perth, and to offer a
view of what may be considered as its present state.  In this,

who are well acquainted with trade, to make a statement of

custom-house, and linen stamp-office, which may be called
the trade of the place.  The following report was given in,
subscribed by Mr John Young, as Chairman of the commit-

and of late, a considerable quantity of cotton-cloth.  There
are above 1500 looms employed in the town and suburbs;
which manufacture of linen and cottons, annually, about

traders in Perth; so that the total of the linen and cotton
manufactures, amounts to about L. 220,000 sterling.  The
different fabrics, and the general purposes to which they
are applied, together with their extent, may be arranged as
