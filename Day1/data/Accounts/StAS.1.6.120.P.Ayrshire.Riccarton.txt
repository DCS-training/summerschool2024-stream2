sown, and sometimes prove a very profitable crop.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-At the village there is a mount
of considerable bulk, the greater part of which appears to be
artificial.  On this, as on many others of the same kind, our an-
cestors met for distributing justice.-The people are in gene-
ral sober and industrious.  The tradesmen in the parish are, with
a few exceptions, either shoemakers or weavers.-This dis-
trict enjoys many natural advantages.  Limestone is found in
great quantities.  The parish is also well supplied with coal at
a reasonable price.  The coal belonging to Sir William Cun-
ingham of Caprington, is justly esteemed the best in Ayrshire.
Great quantities of blind-coal have of late been raised in the
parish; carried by land to Irvine, and thence exported to Ire-
land.  It was proposed, some years ago, to dig a canal from
Riccartoun bridge to join the sea at the Troon; and it is to be
wished that this scheme could be revived and carried into exe-
cution, as the benefits which would arise from it, particularly
to the proprietors of coal, would be very great.
