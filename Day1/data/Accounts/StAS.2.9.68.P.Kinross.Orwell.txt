derived from the purchased land, which at present amounts to
L. 56 Sterling. As it is doubtful whether a legal assessment can
be laid on, so long as there is property belonging to the poor, an
attempt was made about a year ago to lay on a voluntary assess-
ment, in the expectation that those heritors who were either non-
resident or did not attend the parish church, and who had hitherto
contributed little or nothing, would come forward in a handsome
manner. This measure failed; few of those individuals having
given more than what by law they could have been compelled to pay,
and others gave notbing, whatever. A similar attempt is not there-
fore likely again to be made, and ere long the property must be
sold; and when this happens, the few hundred pounds obtained
will speedily vanish, demands to be put on the poor's roll will ra-
pidly increase, and a legal assessment be the result.
  The average number of paupers on the permanent roll, exclusive
of lunatics in confinement, and of persons receiving occasional relief,
were in 1835, 23 who received L. 78, 9s. 9d.; In 1836, 19 who re-
ceived L. 83, 1s. 1d.; in 1837, 26 who received L. 81, 8s. 6d. Those
who received occasional relief in 1835 were 27, who got L. 9, 3s.
5d.; in 1836, 32 received L. 10, 13s. 6d.; in 1837, 40 received
L.20, 16s. 8 1/2d. In 1837, there was one lunatic in confinement,
the cost of which was L. 25, 18s. 2d.
  The annual amount of collections at the church-door were as
follows :- 1835, L. 29, 6s. 8d.; 1836, L. 29, 9s. 9d.; 1837, L. 29,
19s. 3d. During these years, there were also voluntary contribu-
tions to the amount of- 1835, L. 3, 5s. 1d.; 1836, L. 3, 8s. 8 1/2d.;
and 1837, L. 54, 7s. 5d. The mortcloth and other sessional dues
and rent of poor's land amounted, in 1835, to L.62, 15s.; 1836,
to L. 62, 6s. 6d. and in 1837, to L. 63, 14s. 6d. The collec-
tions are applied to the relief of the poor of all denominations in
the parish; under deduction of a salary of L. 3, 3s. to the session-
clerk; L. 3 tothe precentor; and to the beadle L. 1, 1s. The
books, containing a statement of these funds, are inspected twice
a year by a joint committee of the kirk-session and beritors.
  The parish is much annoyed by vagrants, such as shipwrecked
sailors, and persons disbanded from manufacturing establishments,
&C. soliciting relief.

before Christmas, the other on the second Thursday of February),
are held for the sale of fat cattle only. The other four Rre gene-
