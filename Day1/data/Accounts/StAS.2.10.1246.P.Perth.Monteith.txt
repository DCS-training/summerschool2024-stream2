             The polar lights and luminous meteors are often seen here in
         beautiful variety and grandeur.
             At stated seasons this parish is visited by easterly haars, which,
         towards the evenings in the months of spring and autumn, come
         up the Forth.  These haars consist of a cold, dense, moist va-
         pour, which fills the valley of the Forth, extending to the elevat-
         ed lands on each side of it.  Their chilling effects are injurious
         to the field labourer., whose constitution may have6 been much
         excited by the heat and hard labour of the earlier parts of the
         day, and in delicate constitutions produce colds, and affect the
         langs.
