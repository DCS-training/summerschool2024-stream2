the of whom thinking himself slighted, vowed to sacrifice the other
to his resentment, when he again discovered him in her company.  An op-
portunity soon presented itself, when the faithful pair, walking along the
romantic banks of the Kirtle, were discovered from the opposite banks by
the assassin.  Helen perceiving him lurking among the bushes, and dreading
the fatal resolution, rushed to her lover's bosom, to rescue him from the
danger; and thus receiving the wound intended for another, sunk and
expired in her favorite's arms.  He immediately revenged her death,
and flew the murderer.  The inconsolable Adam Fleeming, now sinking
under the pressure of grief, went abroad and served the banners of
Spain, against the insidels.  The impression, however, was too strong to
be obliterated.  The image of woe attended him thither; and the plea-
sing remembrance of the tender scenes that were past, with the melan-
choly reflection, that they could never return, harassed his soul, and de-
prived his mind of repose.  He soon returned, and stretching himself on
her grave, expired, and was buried by her side.  Upon the tomb-stone are
engraven a sword and cross, with "His jacet Adam Fleeming."  The
memory of this is only preserved in an old Scots ballad, which relates the
tragical event, and which is said to have written by Adam Fleeming,
when in Spain.  As the price is little known, and affords a pretty good spe-
cimen of the vulgar dialect spoken at present in this country, which must
have undergone little variation for upwards of 200 years, it is sent for
insertion.

     FAIR HELEN,

     A Tragical Old Scots Song.

     My sweetest sweet, and fairest fair,
     Of birth an worth beyond compare,
     Thou art the causer of my cair,
     Since first I loved thee:

     
     Yet God hath given to me a mind,
     The which to thee shall prove as kind,
     As any one that thou wilt find,
     Of high or low degree.
