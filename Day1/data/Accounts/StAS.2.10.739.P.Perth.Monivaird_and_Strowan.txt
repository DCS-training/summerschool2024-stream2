        Parochial Register.-Up to 1835, the Parochial resisters con-
     sist of six volumes, commencing with September 8th 1685, but
     are not very perfect.  Money transactions, proclamations, and
     baptisms, with occasional minutes of discipline, are all blended to-
     gether.  Separate registers for baptisms, marriages, burials, money
     transactions, and minutes of discipline, have been regularly kept
     since 1835.
        Antiquities.-Several Roman antiquities have been found in
     these parishes, as might be expected from their vicinity to the sta-
     tions of the Roman camps at Ardoch, Dalginross, and Strageath.
     In 1783, a bronze vessel, resembling a coffee-pot in shape, was
     found near a spring (called St Serf's) in the plain of Monivaird.
     In 1805, a bronze head of a spear was raised from the lake of
     Ochterlyre; and in 1808, three similar beads of spears were
     found near the new church of Monivaird.  All these pieces are
     undoubtedly Roman relics, and are in the possession of Sir W.
     Keith Murray, Bart.

     <FOOTNOTE>The part of Easter Meiggar, which stands valued at L.33. 6s. 8d., be-
     longs to Lord and Lady Willoughby, but no division has as yet been made.
