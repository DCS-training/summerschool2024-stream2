an elegant octogonal temple, built by the late Fullerton, who
was a gentleman of classic taste.  This temple commands an
extensive prospect, and is, Baccho laetitiae datori, amicis et otio
sacrum.  The Troone is an excellent situation for sea bathing,
and is much resorted to by the inhabitants of Kilmarnock,
and of other inland parts.  People from Elgin carry on fishing
of salmon at the Troone, and the Black-rock which is near a mile
to the southward.  In dry summers they are most successful, as
floods give the salmon an opportunity of ascending the neigh-
bouring rivers.  Salmon, when most abundant, are sold at

'south-west, one half south from Irvine, 2 miles west from
'Troone-point, 5 miles north north-west from Ayr, and 24

'-In the inside of this Island, opposite to the main land,
'there is good anchoring ground; and, for the direction of
'ships and vessels, 2 stone beacons are erected on the north-
'west part thereof, of such a height as to be easily seen at a
'distance.-The best anchor ground is where these two beacons
'are brought under one, where there is 5 fathoms water with-
'in a cable's length of the shore, and clean ground, which
'grows gradually deeper for half a mile to the south-east, till
'there is 14 fathoms water, and then it grows gradually shal-
'lower towards the bar of Ayr.-There is a ridge of rocks be-
'tween Lady Isle and the Truce-point, about three quarters
'of a mile east from the largest beacon, which is not broad,
'and runs near south and north.  On this ridge there are, at
'low water, 3 and 1 half fathoms, and vessels coming too near
'it are only in hazard of damaging their cables.-The half
'tide rock lies from 1 eight to 1 quarter of a mile north north-
'east from the largest beacon, and is covered at half floods;
'and there is a channel betwixt it and the Island 4 feet deep at
'low water, where small craft may go through, but large ves-
'sels must keep on the outside of it.-The rock called Lap-
'poch, about 100 yards in length, is in a line with Irvine stee-
'ple, the half tide rock, and Lady Isle; and lies about 1 mile
'and 1 half south south-west from the bar of Irvine; it is dry
'at low water, and has a broad channel betwixt it and the
'main land, from 7 to 8 fathoms deep-Navigated and sur-
