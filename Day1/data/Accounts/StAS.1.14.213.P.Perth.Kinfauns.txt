     of Kinfauns.

   This parish begins about a mile and a half below Perth,
and runs for 3 or 4 miles along the northern banks of
the Tay, forming an irregular figure of above 5 miles
long, and between 2 and 3 broad.

   Surface and Soil.-The surface is considerably diver-
sified by level and rising grounds, by wood and water.
The lands on the banks of the Tay are flat.  On the
western boundary, at a small distance from the river,
rises a ridge of hills, whose tops are covered with ex-
tensive plantations.  Of these hills, Kinnoul is the most
remarkable.  It lies partly in the parish of that name,
and partly in the parish of Kinfauns; and presents to
the S. a large abrupt front of rock, of a striking appear-
ance, especially from the old post-road, which went close
to its base.  On this side, the ascent is exceedingly steep,
and its height is 632 feet above the level of the Tay.
The summit peojects in rugged cliffs of a seamy texture,
which being gradually loosened by the frost and rain,
have sometimes fallen in large masses, with prodigious
force, into the plain below.  About 27 years ago, 2
farm house, near the foot of the hill, was almost destroy-
ed by one of these masses of rock, and a woman instant-
ly killed.  On account of this accident, the farm-stead
was removed to a proper distance from such a danger-
ous situation.  The hills afford variety of delightful

or plain; and is also applicable to the situation of the country.  At the
foot of the hills now mentioned, the parish lies in a valley or hollow,
which gradually opens, in an easterly direction, into the plain of the
Carse of Gowrie.  These are the most plausible opinions respecting the
origin of the name; and as opinions only, they are given.  But, even
these suggest, that certainty is not always to be expected, in deductions
from a language which, it is allowed, often affords scope for fancy and
conjecture.
