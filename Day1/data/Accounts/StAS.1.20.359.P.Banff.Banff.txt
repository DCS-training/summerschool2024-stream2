   Battery.-During the late war, a small battery was erect-
ed on the high ground near the harbour.  It is nearly of
the half-moon construction, with turf embrasures*, and
mounts two 18 pounders, and four 12 pounders, besides two
field pieces.
   On one side of the gateway is situated the store-house
and powder-magazine, on the other a guard-room and offi-
cer's apartment.
   Having an extensive command of the bay, this battery
might afford protection against the depredations of a single
privateer; but whether such works, thinly scattered along
the coast, would prove of substantial service in the event of
invasion, is a point somewhat problematical+.

   Military Associations.-The Banff-shire Volunteers con-
sist of 16 companies, under the command of Colonel the
Right Honourable the Earl of Fife, Lord-Lieutenant of the
county.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The embrasure in batteries is now condemned by the able engineers, and
the low parapet recommended in its room, so that the guns may be point-
ed in any direction within scope of the work.

+Colonel Dirom, a native of this town, in his ingenious "Plans for the
" Defence of Great Britain," &c. observes, "Indeed it is impossible to
" lime the coast of an extensive country in such a manner with batteries, as
" to protect it from an invading enemy; for they can be placed in few si-
" tuations in which they may not be avoided: and if otherwise, the guns
" in them are generally so unwieldy and difficult to traverse, that they may
" be approached and stormed without much danger to the assailants.  Bat-
" teries ought therefore to be erected with great caution, and perhaps on-
" ly in situations strong by nature, where they may not easily be surprised
" or attacked on the land-side."
