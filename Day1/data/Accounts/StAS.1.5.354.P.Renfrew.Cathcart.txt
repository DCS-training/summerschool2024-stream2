   School and Poor.-There is but one schoolmaster in
the parish.  Indeed, there is employment only for
one.  In the parish school, there may be from 60 to 80
scholars, who are taught reading, English Grammar, Wri-
ting, Arithmetic and Book-keeping.  It is seldom, that a
classical education is required, and parents, whose circum-
stances enable them to procure it for their children, repair
to Glasgow.  The school salary is small, only 120 merks
Scotch, but, as the wages in this situation are tolerably good,
the schoomaster is able to make a decent livelihood.-The
weekly collections, with the interest of L.200 Sterling, fa-
ved in former times, is at present sufficient for supplying the
exigencies of the poor of this parish.  Unless a very great
change of circumstances takes place, there will be no ne-
cessity for having recourse to a general assessment.  It
should be the study of all, who have it in their power, by
their voluntary contributions, to prevent that necessity, and
to remove it to as great a distance as possible.  In England,
the poor's rates are complained of, as an intolerable burden,
nor does it appear, that the indigent meet with that effec-
tual assistance and relief, which arises from the more sim-
ple and frugal plan adopted in this country.  The week-
ly collection, with the interest above mentioned, amount 
to about L. 25 Sterling a-year, which is all dispersed 
monthly, in small sums, from 2 s. to 5 s. among the persons 
upon the poors roll, according to their necessities. Ten
persons statedly receive assistance in this way , besides re-
lief. occasionally given, to poor house-holders. The ex-
pence of living, is a high here, asn any where in Scotland;
but this is compensated to the labouring part of the inha-
bitants, by the great plenty of money occasioned by the 
manufacturers, and the high prices which they receive, for 
every species of work they can perform.
