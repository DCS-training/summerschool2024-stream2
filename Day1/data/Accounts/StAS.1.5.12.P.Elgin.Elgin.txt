     Statistical Account

of lint has prevailed over a manufacture of woollen stuffs,
which formerly existed in this town and parish, to a con-
siderable amount.  The great number of sheep, then in
the neighbourhood, did not supply the demand, so that it
was necessary to puchase wool from the highlanders in
Strathspey, etc.  The plantations of wood, and sown grasses,
have thrown sheep so much out of the low country, that
thirty years ago, more hundreds were annually sold out of
it, than there are now scores in it.  The wool was then of
a very fine staple, from a small white faced breed, and in-

large bodied, black faced sheep, whose sleeces are of a very
rough and inferior nature, are in request among us.
   That some estimate may be formed of the occupations in
this parish, it may be proper to observe, that in the country
part, there are 9 tailors, 19 weavers, 9 wrights, including
mill-wrights, 5 shoemakers, and 7 blacksmiths.  In the town
are 16 blacksmiths, 70 weavers, 70 wrights, including ma-
kers of ploughs and waggons; 55 shoemakers, 32 tailors,
8 glovers, 3 tinmen, 6 barbers, 4 bakers, 2 surgeons, and 2
physicians.  There are also 2 tanners, who carry on their
business, though not on a large acale; and a soapery, in which
the partners propose to manufacture a considerable quantity.

   Funds of the Town.-The gross amount of the public re-
venue of the town, is about L. 200 Sterling, arising from
lands, feu-rents, petty customs of the markets, etc. and from
the village of Lossiemouth, of which the magistrates ac-
quired the property, from the family of Brodie, in 1694.
They possessed it many years, without any advantage.  At
length some public spirited members of the magistracy,
proposed to improve the harbour, at the river mouth.  From
