deliverance by James II; its distracted state, arising out of the
jealousies and quarrels of its petty chiefs; the incursions of the
English, until the union of the Scottish and English crowns gave
repose to the harassed and almost depopulated country. Suffice
it to say, that the parish of Kelton, from its central position, and
espacially from its proximity to the Castles of Buittle and Thrieve,
the strongholds of the ambitious and turbulent families of the Ba
liols and Douglasses, was necessarily the theatre of many interest-

and concerning which even tradition is now almost silent.
	In Blaeu's "Atlas Scotiae," there is a description of the parish
of Kelton, furnished by John Maclellan about the year 1650. It
is particularly described in Symon's MS. Account of Galloway,
1684; and it is also noticed in Chalmer's Caledonia, Vol. iii.
p. 314.

	Parochial Registers.--It is to be hoped that there are few pa-
rishes in Scotland, the registers of which have been so carelessly
kept as those of Kelton. The session records extend no farther
back than the year 1715. For the next eleven years from that
date the preceedings of the session are reguilarly minuted, and the
register of births is also complete. But from 1726 down 1762,
neither record nor register can be found. For the next twenty-two
