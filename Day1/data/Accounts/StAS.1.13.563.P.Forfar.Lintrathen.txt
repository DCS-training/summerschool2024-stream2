yields corn of a very inferior quality.  Several vallies, fit
only for pasturage, extend northward among the hills,
which are covered with short heath, and buried in snow
during winter.  There are few trees of any age or growth
in this part of the country.

   Rivers.-The Melgam, a considerable stream, has its rise
beyond the N. W. boundary of the parish, runs S. E. along
the base of a mountain, forms a small cataract in the village
of Glentrathen, and after a circuitous course, in a rocky
channel, falls into the Ila below the walls of Airly Castle.
The Carrity, less than the preceding, descends from the
northern part of the parish, and bathes the foot of Catlaw

ties of the hills; and a mean village composed of despi-

Melgam, almost opposite to the church, indicate the poverty
of the inhabitants, who seem to be in a rude state of society.

   Antiquities, Lakes, etc.-About 1/4 mile N. N. E. of the
church, there is an artificial eminence, whose summit com-
mands an extensive prospect.  On this spot a gibbet was
erected for those unfortunate persons, whom the fervile
court of a despotick baron had condemned to death.  Vesti-
ges of the hangman's habitation appear at the foot of the
cumulus, and the name of a neighbouring plot of land per-
