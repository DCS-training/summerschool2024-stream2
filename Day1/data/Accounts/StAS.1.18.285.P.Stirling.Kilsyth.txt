     of Kilsyth.

   If the man who makes a single pile of grass or corn to
grow, where there was none before, in the eyes of Dean
Swift, deserved more of his country than all the politicians
that ever lived, we leave it to the learned to weave a laurel
crown for Mr Graham.
   The method an which his operations were carried on,
were ingenious and singular, and might have been described.
   There is no branch of husbandry more attended to, nor
prosecuted with more ingenuity and success by all classes,
than the cultivation of potatoes.  Every year there is some
real, or imaginary improvement introduced; and it is eager-
ly adopted and prosecuted with much care and perseverance.
I have known many try 8 or 10 species of seed in one season.
This spirit they partly have imbibed from Mr Graham; but
the success is principally owing to local circumstances.  The
soil is not only highly favourable, but every feuer has, and
almost every inhabitant lays his account with taking, a small
lot of ground, for the express purpose of raising potatoes.
They have besides nine and inclination to bestow great care,
and attention, in planting, weeding, and dressing them.
And their endeavours are generally crowned with success*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The following seems to be the result of endless experiments.
   1st, That the kidney potatoe is the best seed, most productive, and pleasant
to the taste at the same time.
   2dly, That ground which has never been broken up before, or at least,
never produced potatoes, is by much the most productive; though not better
manured than other ground.
   3dly, That potatoes ought to be planted each set at the distance of 1 foot
6 inches, from each other; at least in the ridge, even when they are not
drilled.
   N. B.  It is universally agreed, that potatoes when frequently repeated, or
even oftener than once in 7 years on the same ground, are a very scourging
stop; if once in two years, they speedily reduce the soil to a caput mortuum.
