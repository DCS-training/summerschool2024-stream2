ing-boards, by adding another wheel, which had a wonder-
ful effect, as the sheaf could be spread so as to be taken in
and bruised by rollers; and this likewise saved a number of
hands.
   A particular account of the powers of this machine, and
the saving to each farmer, will be given in the appendix.
   Manure.-There has been no limestone or coal hitherto
discovered in this parish.  The only local manure, there-
fore, is dung, which is far from being sufficient for the
lands; and the farmers have to carry lime, as well as coal,
from Stirling, Sauchie, and other places, an average distance
of 12 miles to the parish in general.  Hence, the ground

small navigable canal would be of the utmost importance
to the heritors, independent of the saving of carriage in ge-

profit is given in the appendix.
   No manure is superior to the clay or mud collected in
the bottom of rivulets and burns.  Many of these run thro
this parish; and, were the farmers only at the pains to spread
the scourings of these burns on thei fields, they would find
more benefit from it than even lime.  It enlarges the stock
of fertile earth, and mellows the soil.  Yet few farmers
think of this.  Prejudice and custom rule every action of
our lives; and even those who have taste and judgment to
make experiments, are driven by the multitude into the
practice of what is common.  A little time, however, will
ripen every improvement, and bring it to perfection.

parish was for each farmer to have a kilnof his own.  The
