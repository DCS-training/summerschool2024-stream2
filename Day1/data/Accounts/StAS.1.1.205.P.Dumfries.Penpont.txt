water falls over a ragged rock 10 feet high, that reaches from
side to side:  A little farther down, the Shinnel, between high
and woody banks, runs into the Scarr at right angles.  At
this spot is a large cairn, and the upper end of a fine sheet of
water; 3 mills, and the houses belonging to them, in a clus-
