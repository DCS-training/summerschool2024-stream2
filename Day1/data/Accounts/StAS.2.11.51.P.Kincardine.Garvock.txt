the Howe of Garvock, this originally rough meadow, would soon
outrival the Howe of the Mearns, and repay with interest any pru-
dent outlay. To add to the lease of nineteen from three to se-
ven years, according to the extent of waste ground to be reclaim-
ed on a farm, would encourage improvement, and would eventual-
ly be profitable to all parties.
   As, in this thinly peopled parish, a scarcity of hands is always
felt in time of turnip-hoeing, hay and grain harvest, to feu out a
limited number of cottages, in a convenient spot near the centre
of the parish, with a strict prohibition of all tippling-houses, might
be very advantageous. The inhabitants of these cottages would
find plenty of employment; and the farmers would enjoy much
convenience from having labourers so near. And if all this were
done, the proprietors themselves would find much pleasure in see-
ing the improved state of their lands, and reap much real profit in
their increased rentals; and all, from the highest to the lowest,
would be much benefited from breathing the wholesome and invi-
gorating air of an improved and meliorated climate.
