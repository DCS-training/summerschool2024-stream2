last year, (1792) 140,448 yards were stamped for sale, which,
at an average of 9 d. per yard, is 5,266 L. 16 s.  Of these,
11 twelfths were wove in the parish.  But, at present, (Au-
gulf 1793.) the temporary stagnation of manufactures has
deprived a great number of the hands of their usual em-
ployment. There is likewise a considerable quantity of
household cloth wrought here-There are 5 corn mills,
in the parish, one lint mill, one barley mill, one waulk mill,
and four threshing mills.  There ars likewise two paper
mills, belonging to Meffrs Morison and Lindsay, Pertb, which
manufacture, weekly, paper of different kinds, viz.

   Markets, etc.-Two butchers carry on their business in
the village, who annually kill about 2000 sheep, between
300 and 400 calves, about 150 fat cattle, and about 13
swine.  Their trade has also increased rapidly.  About 13
years ago, the butchers market here commenced about the
latter end of August, and closed about the middle of Janua-
ry; during which time there were sold, at an average, per
week, 40 carcases of sheep and goats; in all about 850.  But,
of late, the public taste has so much improved, that there is
no more demand for goats flesh.  It is only 13 years since
beef was fisrt exposed to sale in the village.  It was a sat ox,
value 7 L. ; and the young man, who embarked in the con-
cern, was thought very injudicious.  The same man now
frequently sells more than one in a week, during the plenti-
ful season ; and, for some of these, he has paid 17 L, and 18 L.
