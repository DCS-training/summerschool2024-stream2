more than 5s. per acre, while in the lower and more favoured por-
tion it is from L.3 to L.4,--the average of the whole being about
17s.
	The universal dictum, that " the recent improvements in
agriculture have been adopted in this parish," is as applicable
to Carluke as it is to most other districts. It must, at the
same time, be observed, that an opinion is becoming prevalent
with the more intelligent of our farmers, that several of these im-
provements are, at least with us, no improvements at all. The
subsoil of the parish consisting of a stiff blue clay, every drain
drawn, and every bushel of lime spread, tells visibly upon the ferti-
lity and earliness of the land, and a great deal has been already
accomplished by this method, as well as by liedging and the rear-
ing of strips of plantations. The attempt, however, to introduce
a regular rotation of crops, appears not to have been productive of
much good. Even in the lower and richer portion of the parish,
the soil, being heavy and wet, is much poached and injured by the
removal of green crops; whilst in the tipper district, again, the
severity ofthe climate renders crops of every description extremely
precarious. With the exception, therefore, of the rich haughs on
the Clyde, the surer and eventually the more profitable method
of tillage, is considered to be, to throw the greater portion of
the parish into permanent pasture, breaking it up every fifth or
sixth year for a crop of oats, and again laying it down in grass.
	It has been found impossible to ascertain precisely the amounts of
the different sorts of annual produce; but the following table, made
up from a comparison of the estimates furnished by several intelli-
gent and experienced individuals, the near coincidence of whose
calculations afforded a test of their correctness, is believed to be a
close approximation to the truth.
