which might also answer for potatoes, fish and salt.  At
present garden stuffs are only to be bought at the gar-
dens.  As to fish, were a particular market once esta-
blished, such as are peculiar to the place, as salmon,
trouts, pikes, perches, and pars, would more readily
be exposed to sale; besides it would encourage the sale

   Church.  The church stands in the middle of the town;
is a tolerable neat modern building; but no great compli-
ment can be paid to its steeple.  The steeple contains 2 bells,
the largest has 3 different dates put upon it at the diffe-

inhabitants, which circumstance in part gave rise to the
building of a seceding meeting-house within these two

of anarchy and disorder, said to be inculcated by some
of their sect, in imitation of the atheists of a neighbouring
kingdom.
   School.  The grammar school here has always been in
great repute; and many gentlemen at the head of the lear-

school has two established teachers; and English, Latin and

is L 16: 13: 4: and the second master's is L 8.  The
scholars are from 70 to 80.  The fees for English are,
1 s. 6 d. per quarter, and for Latin 2 s. 6 d.  The pre-
sent school-house, consisting of two stories, and slated,
