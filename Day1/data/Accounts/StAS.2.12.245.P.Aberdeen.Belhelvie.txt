improvements in agriculture and agricultural industry, for the
quantity of land in this parish at present under cultivation is fully
one-third more than in 1791, and the whole is much better culti-
vated.  There are no towns or villages in this parish.  The po-
pulation is nearly equally dispersed over its whole surface, resid-
ing upon their respective farms.  No trade or manufacture is car-
ried on, except what is immediately connected with agriculture.

   Agriculture.-Owing to the irregularity of the boundaries of this
parish, it cannot be said to contain more than 19,000 standard
acres.  Of these 5000 are in waste land, sea-beach, peat-bog,
and wood; 14,000 are cultivated, of which 9000 have been under
cultivation for a long time, and 5000 have been lately reclaimed
from moor ground.
   There is also a small piece of undivided common in the north-
west corner of the parish.
   Almost all the growing timber in this parish has been planted
lately, and generally in hedge-rows,so that the number of acres
cannot easily be ascertained, but they certainly are not many.
The kinds of trees that thrive best are the ash, plane, elm, alder,
and willow.
   Rent of Land.-The rent of the old cultivated land averages
L.2; second quality, L.1; lately improved from the moorland,
from 10s. to 5s. Sterling.  There are no permanent pastures; but
