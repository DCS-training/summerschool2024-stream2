again in the spring when the corn begins to rise, and every
proprietor, or his tenants, are compelled not only by the
usage of the place, but by bye-laws enacted for the purpose,
to repair and keep up a part of the hill-dyke, proportioned
to the extent of their farms, or his property.  These feeble
fences, if they deserve the name of fences, are intended to su-
persede the necessity of herding domestic animals.  Early
in the summer, when the corn begins to spring, the young
cattle, and particularly all the sheep, are inclosed within
them, rather to wander about than to feed, till the end of au-
tumn.  So long as the nights are short, the weather mild, and
the pasture tolerable, they continue within these limits with-
out much reluctance; but when the season advances, hunger
and cold impel them to leap the dykes in pursuit of better
nourishment, and more shelter.  Instead of their being di-
rected by the tender and attentive care of a shepherd, they
are then attacked with sticks and stones, and hunted by dogs,
with more fury than is commonly used to ravenous beasts in
other countries.  Hence these animals, which under proper
management might be a fource of wealth to the proprietors,
and a benefit to the country at large, are decreasing in num-
ber, and degenerating in quality so fast, that in a short time,
if the mode of treatment is not altered, they will not be worth
the raising.  To protect these harmless, and very useful crea-
tures from their various enemies, to watch over the young
and the old, and the diseased; and, upon occasion, to lead
them to proper shelter and pasture, so as to render their fleece
and their carcase important objects of rural oeconomy, herd-
ing them is absolutely necessary.  So blindly attached, how-
ever, are the ordinary class of people here to antient custom,
and such rooted aversion have they to discover what store
they have to their landlords and to their ministers, that no
force of example, no influence of authority, no arguments
