   From the above it appears, that there are, upon an ave-
rage, 13 baptisms, and 5 marriages annually.  From the
year 1769, to 1775, the average of baptisms in nearly 12;
but the marriages do not amount to 1 yearly.  Hence it ap-
pears, that the population of this parish, since 1769, has in-
creased, which is owing, probably, to the high price of la-
bour, and the encouragement given to tradesmen and day
labourers to reside in it.  There has been, however, a de-
crease of 87 upon the whole, within these 40 years, as the
return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, was 466.  There is no regi-
ster of burials kept in the parish.
