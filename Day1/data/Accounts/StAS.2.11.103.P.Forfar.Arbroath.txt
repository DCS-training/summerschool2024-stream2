When the erection of the academy was contemplated, in 1820, the
magistrates, with a view to obtain the assistance of the public, pro-
posed that every person, subscribing L.10, or upwards, to the in-
tended building, should be a director for life, and have a vote in
the appointment of the masters, with the exception of the rector,
the nomination of whom remains with the magistrates and the pa-
rish minister as before. In the unendowed schools in the parish,
