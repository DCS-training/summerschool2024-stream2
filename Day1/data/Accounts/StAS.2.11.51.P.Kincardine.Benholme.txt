                     PARISH OF BENHOLME.

       PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

               THE REV. JAMES GLEN, A. M. MINISTER.

         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE etymology of the name is sufficiently obvious,-
Ben a hill, and holme a piece of low-lying level ground. This de-
rivation suggests the idea of a diversified surface of hill and dale;
and this is not undescriptive of the general aspect of the parish.
   Extent, &c.-The length and breadth of the parish are nearly
equal, as it extends about 3 miles from north to south, and the
same distance from east to west: consequently it may contain
about 9 square miles. It is bounded on the south-west, by the pa-
rish of St Cyrus; on the north-west, by that of Garvock; on the
north-east, by that of Bervie; and on the south-east, by the Ger-
man Ocean. The parish forms nearly a square, and is thus re-
markably compact.
