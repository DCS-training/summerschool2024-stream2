much to the overthrow of the then all-powerful family of Doug-
las.--George Vaux, cousin to Alexander, was also Bishop of Gal-
loway, It was during  the time of this prelate that James III.
having founded a chapel-royal at Stirling, annexed it to the Bi-
shoprick of Galloway. Sir Patrick Vaux of Barnbarroch was am-
bassador to Denmark in the time of James VI., and a Lord of
Session.
	The inhabitants of this parish seem to have had their full
share of trouble and distreess in the days of persecution. From
the session record, April 15th 1711, we learn that the minister
gave in the account of the sufferings of honest, godly people in the
late times, which was read, and is as follows: "Margaret Lauchli-
son, of known integrity and piety from her youth, aged about eighty,
widow of John Millikin, wright in Drumjargan, was, in or about the
ye`r 1685, in her own house, taken off her knees in prayer, and car-
ried immediately to prison, and from one prison to another, with-
out the benefit of light to read the Scripture; was barbarously
treated by dragoons, who were sent to carry her from Machirwood
to Wigtoun, and being sentenced by Sir Robert Grier of Lagg to
be drowned at a stake within the flood-mark, just below the town
of Wigtoun, for conventicle-keeping, and alleged rebellion, was
according to the said sentence, fixed to the stake till the tide made,
and held down within the water, by one of the town-officers by his
halbert at her throat, till she died.
	"Her husband, JOhn Millikin, when he lived in Killeal, being
frequently quartered on by the soldiers, was obliged to pay to six
of them eight shillings Scots to each man, ilk day, for a consider-
able time, and afterwrds was carried prisoner to Dumfries, where
he was fined in a considerable sum.
	"Andrew M'Cubbin and his spouse Elizabeth Millikin, daughter
to the said John Millikin and Margaret Lauchlison, about 1685,
were stript of all their goods, had all their household furniture
burnt to ashes by the dragoons, and themselves and their small
childrens banished from hotse and hold.
	"Alexander Vaux of Barwhannie, brother-german to John Vaux
of Barnbarroch, and Margaret Maxwell, his lady, (who afterwards
became laird and Lady of Barnbarroch,) from 1666 to 1689, the
time of the late happy revolution, were harassed, processed, and
fined, though there was nothing could be laid to their charge, but
that they would not comply with the times, and did resett godly
people and ministers.
