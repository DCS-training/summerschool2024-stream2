the number of residenters.  Although, therefore, the general cen-
sus, lately taken, shows an apparent increase of the population
within the last ten years, that increase would have appeared much
more considerable had the list of the inhabitants been made out
five years ago.  The writer uses the word "apparent," as the late
census was made at a season of the year when many families, usu-
ally, resident in Glasgow, take houses in this parish for the benefit
of country air.

  Habits and Character of the People.--The proximity of this pa-
rish to Glasgow, and the diversified nature of the pursuits in which
its inhabitants are engaged, chiefly, however, agricultural and ma-
nufacturing, render it extremely difficult to form a correct estimate
of their general character.  It must be admitted, however, that, in

of the parish may well bear comparison with any of the people in
the surrounding country.  Comparing the session record of the
present day with that of the last century, there is a very marked
improvement in the morals of the parishioners.

  Agricultural Econnmy.--The number of acres in the parish is
2950 imperial measure, almost the whole of which are under a re-
gular rotation of tillage.  There may be about sixty acres laid out
as lawn in permanent pasture around the houses of some of the
principal heritors, but these may at any time be, and occasionally
are, cropped to advantage.  There may also be about ninety acres
covered with thriving wood; but there is almost no land in the pa-
rish that cap be called uncultivated, although, not forty years ago,
there was not one farm within its bounds which did not contain
more or less of waste ground--which successful cultivation has now
caused to disappear.  About twenty of the acres of growing wood
