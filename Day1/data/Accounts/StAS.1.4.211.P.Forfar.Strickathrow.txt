has furnished the country with seed, reckoned superior in
quality, and better adapted to the climate than what is
imported.  The common mode of farming here, is half
grass and half crop, with a field of peas or turnips, but
there are many exceptions.  The rotation is, 1. oats; 2.
bear or barley; 3. oats; 4. a green crop; 5. bear or bar-
ley, along with 12 pounds red, and 4 pounds white clover
seed, and half a boll of rye-grass seed the acre.  As soon
as harvest is got in, the ground is fallowed or ribbed; and
March is generally well advanced, before any seed is sown,
but this depends on the season.  All husbandry work that
requires draught, is performed with horses, and the ordi-
nary sort of plough is used.  Horses, cows, sheep, swine,
etc. are generally of a middle size, but the breed of horses
and cows is sensibly improving.  Black cattle, of a year
old, will bring from L. 2 to L. 3 each; this article, and
grain, from the two principal commodities of the parish,
and for these there is generally a ready market, the town
of Brechin being at the distance of 3 miles, and Montrose
7 miles from this parish.  New leased farms pay at the
rate of L. 1, I s. the acre of arable land, but this is reck-
oned dear, the old leases being considerably lower.  Trades-
men and other who choose a small piece of ground for
their convenience, pay from L. 1, 5 s. to L. 1, 10 s. an
acre.  The rent of land has advanced very considerably
since 1751; in that year a farm was rented at 12 bolls of
meal, 12 bolls of oats, and L. 4: 13: 6 in money, making
altogether somewhat less than L. 20; now the same farm
is divided into 2, one of which pays L. 86, and the other
L. 44 a-year.  The valued rent is L. 2614: 16: 11 Scots.
The real rent cannot easily be ascertained.
