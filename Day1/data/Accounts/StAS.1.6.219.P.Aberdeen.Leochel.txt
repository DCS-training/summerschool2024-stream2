made.  If every man would pay the composition-money, and
men were hired with a proper overseer, the roads would be
much more sufficiently done.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church is old, and in bad
repair.  Sir William Forbes of Craigivar is patron.  The manse
was repaired and enlarged in 1767, and is a commodious small
house.  The stipend is 32 bolls of meal, at 8 stones per boll; 16
bolls of bear; L.31: 2: 2 8/12 sterling of money; besides 50 merks
Scotch, and small services, valued at other 50 merks, paid by the
tenants of Corse, for serving that cure.  The glebe, though not
legal, is a piece of the best ground in the parish.
   The Secession began here about 36 years ago, owing to the
reformation of church-music in a neighbouring parish.  There is
a very good stated Seceder kirk in the end of this parish, and a
manse near it.  The minister's stipend is L. 40 sterling, made
up from the seat-rents and collections.  The congregation seems
to be upon the decline.  The minister is a sensible man,
and his hearers quiet and inoffensive.  Such of them as belong
to this parish get aid from the poor's funds in the same man-
ner as the poor of the Established church do.
   There is a good school-house here, but no garden for the
schoolmaster.  His salary is only 100 merks Scotch; his per-
quisites, college-fees, and session-clerk's fee, scarcely amount
to L. 6 sterling yearly.
   The poor's funds amount to about L. 40 sterling; besides
1000 merks Scotch, mortified by Sir John Forbes of Craigivar's
lady, and which, by the will of the mortifier, must remain in
the hands of that family; but the interest of it is regularly paid
to the kirk-session in meal, and divided among the poor in the
lands of Craigivar and Corse.  The weekly collections, with
what is got about a communion time, do not exceed
L. 3: 10 sterling per annum.  The poor have no other funds,
except penalties, and a very small rent for the poor's lost.
