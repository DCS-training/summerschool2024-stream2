the old church of that parish, of which the ruins are still
extant in a pleasant valley, on the water of Conan, with
the contiguous grounds gently sloping towards it, and o-
verlooked by those on the opposite side of the river.  It is
called Loggy Wester, to distinguish it from another parish
of the same name, within the bounds of this Synod.

   Situation, Extent, Proprietors, etc.-Considering these
parishes, which were thus originally divided, as now but
one, and Urquhart, (agreeable to general use), as compre-
hending both, its extent is about 9 or 10 statute miles in
length, and from 3 to 4 in breadth.  It belongs to the Pre-
sbytry of Dingwall, and Synod of Ross.  It lies along Cro-
marty Frith, terminating in the river of Conan, in a direction
nearly from E. to W. and in a position in general gently
declining towards the shore.  At high water the tide flows
to within about 2 miles of the western extremity of the
parish, and at low water retires much the same distance
from its eastern extremity, leaving exposed a flat beach,
with the river lying about half way between the opposite
shores.-There are only 3 heritors in the parish, by whose
estates it is formed into as many distinct divisions, each of
them, occupying a continued extent of some miles along the
shore, (including under that designation, both the sea coast
and the bank of the river), and running from thence to the
uncultivated heights or ridge of moor lying between this
parish and those of Killearnan and Kilmuir-Wester.  The
principal seats of the heritors, and the bulk of the fortunes
of some, if not all of them, lie in other parishes.  They
have, however, seats in this parish.  There is an old, but
a good house, and lately repaired, at Findon,  in the eastern
division of the parish, belonging to Sir Roderick Macken-
zie of Scatwell.  It is pleasantly situated between Cromar-
ty Frith on the one side, and a beautiful oak wood on the
