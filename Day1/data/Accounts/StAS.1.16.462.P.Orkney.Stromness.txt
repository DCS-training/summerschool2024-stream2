moved to a place of safety.  In 1788 a ship laden with
deals was wrecked at the same place.  The cargo was sa-
ved by the assistance of the people of that parish, but the
Captain, or owners, either refused or delayed to pay the
salvage as previously agreed upon.  This delay in pay-
ment occasioned the plunder of the cargo of a small sloop,
wrecked in the same place in 1790.  The people, disap-
pointed of their just expectations of the salvage due them
for the former wreck, would not work to save the cargo of
this sloop, nor was there any person of sufficient influence
in the parish to direct them.  The Captain took little con-
cern in the matter, and the Vice-Admiral Depute was
distant 15 miles.  As the mob often are influenced by pas-
sion and resentment rather than by justice and reason, they
thought this was a proper opportunity for repaying them-
selves of the salvage due them for the former wreck, as
if all vessels were the property of one man, not considering,
that in thus doing what they thought an act of justice to
themselves, they were doing injustice to the proprietors of
the cargo.  Others thought, that as no person appeared to
direct them to save the cargo, there would be no injustice
in taking away what, in a few hours, would be lost in the
sea, and consequently of no value to any person.  The car-
go was consequently plundered, and several persons were
criminally tried before the Justiciary Court, but none were
condemned; all were acquitted.  This is the only instance
wherein any person belonging to these parishes has been
criminally tried.-The shipwrecks on the coasts of these
parishes are not many, as may be seen by the following
list for the period of 33 years last past.
