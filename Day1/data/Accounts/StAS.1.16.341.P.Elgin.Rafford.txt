   Longevity.-Few of the natives are remarkable for lon-
gevity.  There are now only about three individuals in
the parish whose ages exceed 80, and the generality of old
men seldom attain that period.

   Agriculture.-The bulk of the people are employed in
agriculture, and some have pretty extensive farms, though
few have begun to inclose their grounds, or to lay down
green crops.  This defect may be partly owing to want of
due encouragement, as well as to ancient prejudice, to which
last cause it is perhaps too often ascribed.  Of late, indeed,
several of the farmers have built decent houses, for which
they have an allowance from the landlord, and a spirit of
improvement begins to prevail.  Those whole farms are
in good order, yoke two horses only in a plough, with
which an expert hand will make very neat and excellent
work; but the greatest number discover a predilection for
oxen, of which they generally couple 6 together, and in
the hilly parts, (or as they are called provincially the

the yoke is frequently composed of two cows, and two hor-
ses to lead.

   Occupations, etc.-Spinning flax is the great occupation
of the females, most of which they raise at home, and make

growth is fine enough for shirting.  Many of the poorer
class, too, support themselves by spinning to yarn-merchants,
who allow them from 10 d. to 1 s. per spindle.
   Of handicraftsmen weavers are the most numerous class,
amounting to 16 or 17, including journeymen and appren-
tices.  There are 4 tailors; 3 blacksmiths; 3 millers; 5
joiners, and some of the farmers work in wood, and make
