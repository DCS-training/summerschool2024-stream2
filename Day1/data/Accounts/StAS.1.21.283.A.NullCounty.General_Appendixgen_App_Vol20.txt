     The Statistical Account

pression.  The fabric is long ago in ruins; but the wall is
straight and entire as on the day that it was finished, except
where they have torn the freestone out of it.  The lime of
this building is firm and hard, as a rock; and affords an ad-
ditional proof, that the manner of preparing lime, so as to
give good cement for building, was not lost in the wreck of
antient Rome, as has erroneously been alledged.  This house
has been designed for defence against any sudden attack;
having on each corner the old-fashioned round turrets, with
many little port holes: but it could not have stood out against
artillery.
   In the middle of this village lives Mr Scott of Scalloway,
in a neat little modern house.  This gentleman has done a
good deal to hinder the village from falling into decay.  At
the west end of the village is the house and garden of West-
shore.  The house is a mean old building.  The garden, when
properly taken care of, is by much the best in Zetland.  Here
are several shrubs, bushes, and even trees, which are scarcely
to be seen any where else in these islands; several ellons,
(elms, I suppose,) plane tree, willows, grown to a good

bay, the laurel bay, mezereon, horse chesnut, box, ash, and
a good thorn hedge, and brooch, which here is a fine
flourishing shrub; also gooseberries, currants, honeysuckle.
Many of these are now lost, since the garden has been ne-
glected.
   From Scalloway, north-east, is a fine pleasant valley, with
a good many small inland farms; but a part of this valley is
occupied by two lakes.  On the north end of the largest, and
at some distance from Scalloway, is the kirk and manse of
Tingwall.  This kirk had once a steeple at the west end of
it; but of late it has been taken down, left its fall should
bring down the roof of the kirk.  In the lake is a small
