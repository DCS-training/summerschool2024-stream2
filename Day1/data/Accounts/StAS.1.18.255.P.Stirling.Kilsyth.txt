as well as the inhabitants of the parish; that sum becomes
often a considerable and very seasonable supply.
   By act of parliament, 1597, those funds are entrusted to
the Kirk Session; and they never can be committed to better
hands.  Though the management is entirely a labour of love,
and a great labour too, often attended with much obloquy,
and seldom or never rewarded even by the grateful acknow-
ledgement of the heritors; yet, as it involves the interest of
the poor, it is regarded by every elder as a sacred deposit.
With diligence and discretion they consider the case of the
needy.  By associating with every class of people, they be-
come acquainted with the real wants and dispositions of the
widow, the orphan, and the fatherless, the feeble, the aged
and infirm, and speedily administer relief.  Upwards of
L. 100,000 ster. at least, is entrusted to the elders of the church
of Scotland; and by them distributed with a degree of side-
lity and public spirit, which reflects the highest honour upon
their office.  Yet though the landed interest are relieved of a
burden, which they themselves could not submit to, and
from a duty which men of high rank could scarcely discharge,
it is seldom that they will allow a Session house, or even a
shade for collecting for the poor; or if it be granted, it is
often with reluctance.  And yet I suppose, that the greatest
part of them would sooner erect such a shade at his own ex-
pence, than submit to the danger and drudgery of standing a
whole hour, even one sunday of the year, in a cold bleak
winter day in the open air, to collect the mite which every
worshipper offers.
   That the funds of this parish have been collected with
such trouble, managed with such fidelity, and distributed
with such discretion, as I have now hinted, will appear from
the following particulars.
