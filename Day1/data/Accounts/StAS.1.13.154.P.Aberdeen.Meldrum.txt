   English miles, and in others only about 2.  It contains
nearly 6000 Scotch acres.  the air is healthy, and the soil
in general good.  The whole parish almost (the mosses ex-
cepted) might be brought into cultivation by the plough
alone; and accordingly, a good deal of barren ground has 
already been, and still more is just now bringing into tillage
in this way.  In the south part of the parish, where the
town of Old Meldrum is situated, and a good way around
it, the soil is a strong rich loam above clay, which when
properly manured, bears luxuriant crops.  The north part of it
lies higher, in a thinner sharper soil, does not require so much
manure, and yields not so weighty crops.  There are seve-
ral quarries of the granite to be found in the parish, some
of them very easily wrought, and of such a quality as that 
the stones may be dressed almost for any purpose.  There
are not small rivulets inthis parish, but such as take their
rise in it; and yet there are upon the confines of it, 3 meal-
mills belonging to it, which are mostly driven by water
rising in it.

   Villages.-Old Meldrum was erected by charter into
burgh of barony in the year 1672.  The bailies, 2 in num-
ber, are elected by Mr Urquhart of Meldrum, superior of
the burgh, and have the same authority as the bailies of any
other burgh of barony have, since the abolition of jurisdic-
tions in 1748.  There is a very good weekly market in it,
for all kind of provisions, the best in the country north of
Aberdeen.  The Inhabitants in number about 783, consist
of merchants, tradesmen of all kinds, and day-labourers;
and from the inhabitants, one may judge off the number of
feus, all the houses in the town being built on feued ground.
There are no manufacturers as yet established in it, but in
the hosiery line.  But from its local situation, it appears
very well adapted for the linen and thread manufactures,
