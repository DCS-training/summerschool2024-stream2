the north and easterly storms, to which it had been much ex-
posed, that at present it may be fairly considered as one of the
safest harbours in North Britain, and also one of the easiest ac-
cess. The depth of the Oharbour in spring-tides, is from 16 to
18 feet.  The piers, bason, and harbour may include about 2
English acres.  It is proposed, as soon as circumstances will
allow, to have a dry dock, which can be conveniently situated
on one side of the bason, and will be another material im-
provement.

   Ship-building and Ships.-At Borrowstownness, ship build-
ing has been carried on pretty extensively for 40 years.
There are 2 builders at present, of considerable eminence in
their profession, who employ from 30 to 40 men constantly;
and build vessels from 40 to 350 tons burden.  One ship is
now building for a Company at Greenock, of nearly 400
tons.
   The shipping belonging to the town, are at present 25 sail;
whereof 17 are brigantines, of 70 to 170 tons per register;
and 8 sail are sloops, from 20 to 70 tons per register; employ-
ing about 170 men and boys.  Of the brigantines, 6 are
under contract to sail regularly once every 14 days, to and
from London.  They are all fine vessels, from 147 to 167
tons per register.  The remaining 11 brigantines, and 1 of
the sloops, also a good vessel, are chiefly engaged in the Bal-
tictrade.  The other 7 sloops, are for the canal and coasting.
The shipping of the port, including all the creeks, are said to
be nearly 10,000 tons per register; and those of Borrows
stownness, make about one fourth of the whole.

   Trade.-Several branches of commercial and mechanical
industry are carried on at Borrowstownness.  A pottery was
begun on a small scale in the year 1784.  Within these 3
