writings, in civil and ecclesiastical records, Ecclesgreig is the
name generally used.

   Situation and Fatent.-The parish of Ecclesgreig or St. Cyrus
is situated in the southern extremity of the county of Kincardine.
It lies in 56 degree 45' N. lat., and 2 degree 10' W. long. from London.
The nigh road, from Montrose to Aberdeen, runs through
the parish, from the 3 d to a little beyond the 8th mile
stone from Montrose.  It is 5 miles long from E. to W., and 3
miles broad from N. to S.; and, being nearly of a rectangular
form, its whole surface may be reckoned to contain 15 square
miles.

declivities, and gradual risings, is intersected by a few dens
and rivulets, and rises into several eminences and little hills.
It is curious to remark with what interrupted elevation the
land rises, from the bay of St. Cyrus to the Grampian Hills.
It rises high, bold, and rocky, with a sudden elevation above
the coast.  It then subsides a little, or continues nearly on the
level for a quarter of a mile towards the north.  It afterwards
rises gradually, into several little hills or eminences, a mile far-
ther north.  It lowers again on the northern confines of the
parish; and rises still higher in the more extended chain of
the hills of Garvock.  It sinks almost as low as the level of
the sea in the how, or hollow lands of the Mearns; and rises
in sublime heighth, and extended grandeur, in the Grampian
Mountains.  More than three fourths of the whole surface
are arable.  The hills of Bridgeton and Woodston are plant-
ed.  The eminences of Bidderee and Craigie are already ar-
able; and the hill of Morphy is mostly capable of being made
so.  The muirs of Canterland, Murihead and Craigie, on the
