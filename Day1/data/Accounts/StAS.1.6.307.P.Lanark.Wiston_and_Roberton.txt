   Heritors, Agriculture, Produce, etc.-The heritors are 6 in
number, 2 of these have each a small or moderate farm in the
parish.  One of them farms his own property, which is part-
ly inclosed and subdivided.  The present Lord Justice Clerk is
the only considerable heritor.  He has a seat in the parish,
round which his Lordship has made great improvements in
farming, planting, and inclosing.  There are no inclosures or
growing timber worth mentioning in the rest of the parish.
   The mode of farming which prevails here, is much the same
as has obtained from time immemorial.  Even about the vil-
lage of Wistoun, the tenants of the croft lands have not their
possessions separately divided, but intermingled with one ano-
ther in small spots here and there, or run-rig.  This, however,
is not the case through the whole parish.-The soil, especi-
ally about the villages, is good, anti the land lets high.  There
is lime in the parish, but the road to the kilns is often scarcely
passable.  There are commons, moors, and mosses, in the
parish.
   The chief produce is oats and barley, which are allowed to
be very good, and much more than sufficient for the inhabi-
tants, though the situation is high, and tlm climate rather cold.
and damp, which often occasions late harvests.  The crops
here have been very defective since the year 1782; perhaps
crops 1788 and 1791 may be considered as exceptions.-Thil-
lage, with very high multures, prevails here.-Besides arable,
there are a good many sheep farms, particularly in the upper
part of the parish.  Several farms let for about L. 100 per an-
num.  As in other parts of the country, so here too, the num-
ber of tenants has been much diminished by the conjoining of
farms.-Agricultural labours and improvements, which, to-
gether with tending cattle, are perhaps the most natural and
salutary occupations of man, do not flourish here.  Trade and
