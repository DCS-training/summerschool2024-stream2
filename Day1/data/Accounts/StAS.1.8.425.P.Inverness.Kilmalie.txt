during the two last weeks of March; barley, and potatoes, in
the end of April, and beginning of May.  Barley is reaped in
the end of August; oats, from the beginning of September to
October, and potatoes, about the end of September.
   The following is the average number of English acres, un-
der the different forts of grain, on each of the sheep farms:

<TABLE>
               13 acres are under l2 bolls of oats.
                4           under  3 bolls of barley.
               10           under 14 bolls of potatoes,
               --- 
        Total, 27 acres in tillage.
           34,973 acres in sheep pasture.
          ------- 
   In all, 35,000 acres; being 16 miles by 3 and two fifths.

   In farms of less extent, there is a smaller proportion ac-
cordingly.  Indeed, those proportions are equal to a medium
of 4 ordinary sheep farms in the parish, or to 8, according to
former divisions.  In farms, where there are black cattle
stocks, there are nearly 4 times this proportion of ground in
culture.  The pasture grounds, including sheallings, do not
rent at above 4 d. per acre annually.  The returns, upon an
average, are, of oats, 3 from 1, of barley, 5, and of potatoes, 10.
There is no hemp, and very little flax seed, sown in the parish.
The vallies and meadows yielding spontaneously plenty of ex-
cellent grass:  there is but little clover, or rye grass sown.  The
gardens yield the ordinary vegetables.

   Imports and Exports.-The articles imported are, meal,
flour, oats, butter, cheese, whisky, foreign spirits, salt, timber,
tar, and all kinds of mercantile goods.  There were entered
inwards, in the year 1791, at the port of Fort-William,
coastwise, 8,000 bolls of oatmeal; which, at the average price
of 16 s. 8 d. per boll, is 6666 L. 13 s. 4 d.  But only about 2500
