already acquired their present designations.  As the monas-
tries of Dundrennan, Melross, Newbottle, Newabbey, Glen-
luce, Kelso, and Culross, belonged to the order of Cittertians,
or Bernardines, who by the religious profuseness of King,
or St David, and others, were extremely rich; and the
parish had its old name from St Kentigern, who was of that
order, and a monk in the Abbey of Culross, founded by
Malcolm M'Duff Earl of Fise.  The Spittal was probably a
hospitium or inn, and the road, with its crosses which also
served as land-marks, an accommodation for travellers passing
from one monastry to another; the Back Spittal suiting such
as went by the north side of the hills.  In confirmation of
this, the weary and benighted traveller is still considered as
having a right to shelter and protection at the Old Spittal;
and one of the out-houses, with some straw, is generally al-
lotted for that purpose.  It is also remarkable, that there is
still an inn upon these lands, though indeed on a different
foundation, making the first stage on the great roads from
Edinburgh to Moffat, and Dumsries and Biggar, along the
foot of the Pentland Hills; and farther, it is called the New
House, though now a very old one, seemingly to distinguish
it from the Spittals, in the place of which it had been built.
These lands, till lately, held of Herriot's Hospital in Edin-
burgh.  The last proprietor who resided at Spittal, where
there is still a comfortable slated house, and some fine old
ash trees, was a gentleman of the name of Oswald, who was
accidentally shot by his servant who was walking behind
with his gun, in going to Slipperfield Loch, in the parish of
Linton, to shoot wild ducks; and he lies in that church-yard,
under the following epitaph.
