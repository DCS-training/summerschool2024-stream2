received a considerable improvement within these 20 years.
The outfield was frequently ploughed, but the crop not
worth the labour; now every pendicle is attended to, and
exhibits, when the season is favourable, tolerable good
culture.  It is not long since they discovered the happy
effects of lime on the strong clay.  It is now very gene-
rally used; and when judiciously applied, produces very
good crops.  It is brought from the lime-works in burnt
shells, and laid on at the proportion of from 50 to 100 bolls
per acre.  To do the field justice, it will take 100 bolls to
each acre.  The boll is 7 d. at the kiln, and consists of the
wheat firlot, or Winchester bushel.  They have strictly no
regular rotation.  The usual one is summer-fallow, with
lime and dung; first year wheat; 2 d pease; 3 d oats, sown
with grass, cut one year or two, and pastured as many; or,
instead of oats, the 3 d year barley, prepared with frequent
ploughing and dung, and laid down with grass-seeds, which
is a course more favourable to the ground.
   As it is but a small part of the farm that a sufficient
quantity of dung can be procured to prepare for wheat,
other parts are limed on the pasture, two or three crops
taken, and laid down in grass; a green crop generally suc-
ceeding oats.
   The introduction of wheat has been attended with one
good circumstance, the cultivating, or bringing in, as it
may well be termed, of that poor ejected alien, the outfield;
for the summer-fallow is frequently applied there, and
being furnished with lime and dung, a pretty good crop of
wheat is produced, with one of pease, and another of oats.
By repeated applications of this nature to the outfield, it
has made very grateful returns, producing a crop of wheat
from 7 to 10 bolls an acre, with two more proportionably
fertile.
