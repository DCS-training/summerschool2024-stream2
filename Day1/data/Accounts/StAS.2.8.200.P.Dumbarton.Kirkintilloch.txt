are a sort of thin gauze web.  The lappets are woven in the usual
way, with the aid of a wheel with catches, and a spring which raises
and depresses the needles which form the flowers. The thread is
never changed, but always comes through the same needle, and
hence resembles tambouring. This trade is at present most de-
pressed. Mr Marshall employs 44 journeymen, who have every-
thing provided. They can make 6s. and 7s. per week each. This
Work goes all to India, from whence letters are often received in
two months. In 1835, there were 1600 weavers in the town of
Kirkintilloch ; according to the statement of Mr Marshall, there
are now about 2000 weavers. Perhaps the cotton trade, in
shape of wages alone, will bring into the town of Kirkintilloch,
L. 700 per week, or L. 36,400, per annum, which is only at the
moderate allowance of 7s. per week each, or L. 18, 4s. Sterling
per annum. Among the 2000 weavers, there are only, however,
471 male heads of families, and, allowing five to each family, it
will make 2355 individuals in all, but from actual surveys, the num-
ber dependent on these 471 heads of families is 2473. Now, if
we take this latter number as the gross amount of weaving popu-
lation, we will find that there is only about one-fifth not employed
at work, so that there must be a great deal of clubbing, or of the
joining of wages together, which may make up a good common in-
come. A weaver's wife can wind pirns for three looms, which, at
3d. each, yield 9d. per day.
  Besides the cotton trade, there is a calico printfield employing
about 120 hands, including printers, mechanics, and labourers.
There is also a silk-hat manufactory employing upwards of 20
hands, and an iron foundery well employed. There are two dis-
tilleries in constant operation, and one occasional distillery. Of
the two in constant operation, the one produces 1800 gallons of
whisky per week, and the other 1400 gallons, or in all 3200, which
is 116,400 gallons per annum, which at the moderate computation
of 6s. per gallon, will yield per annum L. 48,920 Sterling.
  The average hours of labour for weavers is 12 hours per day;
masons and labourers 10 hours in summer, and 7 in winter: join-
ers and earpenters 10 hours; shoemakers, blacksmiths, and tailors
12 hours; painters, plasterers, and staters the same as masons, A
labourer's wages per day ought to be equal to the price of a peck
of oatmeal.
