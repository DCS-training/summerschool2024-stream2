   The ancient Division of the Lands of the whole Parish.-
The ancient division of the parish, to this day retained and
known by all here, was into davochs of land, which are
four: 1st, The davoch of Ard-Assint, including the whole
tract and farms thereon, from Skiak river all along to the
march of Ledmore, at Auld-an-nakal gach, etc. to Knock-
an, as particularly mentioned in the preceding pages.  This
davoch was the only one which suffered considerably by
feudal differences and powerful jurisdiction, now happily
abrogated since 1748.
   2d davoch, Ed-ra-isk, extends from Inver-kirk-ag river
to that of Inver; its hill pasture lies towards Su-il-vine and
Canisp mountains.
   3d davoch, Row-store, lies extended along shore from
Inver river to Garve-auld of Clashnessy.  The pasture for
yell-cattle is the out-skirts of all the farms, and called Me-
an-Assint, formerly described.
   4th davoch, Slish a-chilish, situated betwixt said Garve-
auld of Clashnessy, along the coast of Kilis, to the march
of Unapool (as formerly represented) with Glenoul of
Edra-chilish parish.  The hill-pasture of this davoch is in part
a division of Me-an-Assint, to the boundary of Glenlerag
farm by Loch-nedd.  Glenlerag, Ardvare, Ry-an-traid,
and Unapool, have out-skirts, each of their own.  For rea-
sons which will appear in the sequel, the subdivisions of these
four davochs must not be omitted, for they are still retained
and known by the natives; and by attending to it in its
proper place, a pretty exact calculation can be made of all
the live-stock of every species of cattle in the parish.
