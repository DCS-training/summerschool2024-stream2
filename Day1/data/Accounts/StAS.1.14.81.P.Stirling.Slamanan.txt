     Of Slamannan, or St. Laurence.

the S. W. end, the shires of Stirling and Lanark meet
with the shire of Linlithgow.  It consists of the old pa-
rish of Slamannan, and a part annexed from the parish
of Falkirk.  The original parish of Slamannan is from
4 to 5 miles in length, and from 2 to 3 in breadth, and
lies upon the south side of the water of Avon, which
anciently separated it from the extensive parish of Fal-
kirk, which lay upon the north of the Avon; but about
the year 1730, there was a division made of the parish of
Falkirk, when the whole parish of Polmont was taken off
it, and also a part of it annexed to the parish of Slaman-

the north side of the river, and is nearly of the same
length with the old parish, and about one mile broad; so
that the present parish of Slamannan, including the annex-
ation, will be from 4 to 5 miles in length, and from 3 to
4 in breadth.

through this parish, from W. to E., takes its rise from a
loch in the parish of Cumbernauld, called Fanny Side
Loch.  It immediately receives a considerable addition
from a small rivulet which takes its rise from a moss in
the East Monkland parish, about 2 miles distant, and
which some think is more properly the head of the Avon.
Certain it is, there is a farm-house very near that moss,
where this rivulet comes from, which is called Avon-
Head.  There are also 3 lochs in this parish; one in the
north side of the annexation, called the Ellridge Loch,
which supplies a corn mill with water, and falls into the
water of Avon; the other two are upon the S. W. side
of the old parish, called the little and the great Black
Lochs; the one of which, namely the little Black Loch,
runs E., and the other, the great Black Loch, which is
