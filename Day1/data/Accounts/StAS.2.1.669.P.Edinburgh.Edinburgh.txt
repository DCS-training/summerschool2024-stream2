the 2d, L. 3, 18s. 9d.; the 3d, L. 5, 5s.; and the highest, L. 6,
11s. 3d. per annum. A widow, on the death of her husband, was
entitled to an annuity corresponding to that one of the above rates
which lie had chosen, being L. 10, L. 15, L. 20, or L. 25, and
his children, if he left no widow, received a sum equal to ten years
of the annuity, which would have been payable to the widow, being
L. 100, L. 150, L. 200, or L. 250, and such of the children as
were under sixteen years of age received in addition a small al-
lowance annually (L. 13) until they attained that age. Every con-
tributor, on his marriage, pays a sum equal to one year's rate,
and, if be was forty years of age at entry, an additional sum
equal to 2 1/2 rates. In the year 1783 there had been accumu-
lated, for the purposes of the fund, a capital of L. 50,000, which
somewhat exceeded the amount expected from the calculations
on which the scheme was founded. In process of time, from the
change in the manner of living of all classes, and the decrease of
the value of money, the annuities of the widows were considered
quite inadequate to their support, and application was again made
to Parliament in 1814, and a new act of the legislature obtained.
Subscriptions, averaging L. 10 each, had been made by the con-
tributors, as the foundation of a new or supplementary fund, and
the new act provided, that a contribution of similar amount should
be exacted from each new entrant; the four annual rates were
raised respectively to L. 3, 3s., L. 4, 14s. 6d., L. 6, 6s., and L. 7,
17s. 6d.; and a grant was made to the same fund of the vacant
stipends of parishes, previously at the disposal of the respective
patrons for pious uses. A gift was also made to the fund from
the bishops' rents of Scotland. The widows have now annuities,
amounting respectively to L. 22, L. 30, L. 38, and L. 46. A far-
ther increase is contingent on circumstances. Accumulaton has
been prevented of new by the low rate of interest. No addition
was made by the new act to the original provisions for children,
which vary, as formerly, from L. 100 to L. 250. The capital of
both funds now amounts to nearly L. 100,000. The ordinary
trustees of the fund are, the ministers of the Presbytery, and the
professors of the University of Edinburgh, who, with a collector
and clerk, conduct its affairs.
   Society for the Sons of the Clergy.-This society was instituted
in the year 1790, by a few lay sons of clergymen, for the benefit
of the children of the ministers of the Church of Scotland. In
1792 it was incorporated by royal charter. Its affairs are con-
ducted by a president and committee of management, which hold
their meetings in Edinburgh.
