			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	Since the former Statistical Account was written, the population
has increased. The value of land has risen also considerably, and
the farms, which have been let since the present proprietor ac-
quired the property, have been so improved as to wear a totally
different aspect. Mr Monteith takes a deep interest in all agri-
cultural improvements, and has exhibited them on his own home
farm to a very great extent. It is not saying too much to affirm,
that his residence in the parish has proved a blessing of no ordi-
nary character. Besides affording constant employment to the la-
bouring classes, and striving to render their situation comfortable,
he takes every opportunity of discountenancing vice, and promot-
ing true religion, by his personal example.

ten merks early, from the revenue of his mills of Maldeslay, for
the purpose of supporting lights at the tomb of St Machute. * In a
second charter of the same monarch, dated 8th March 1315, he
conveys to these monks from his mills of Carluke, other ten merks
yearly, to supply eight wax lights for the tomb of Machute, on
Sundays and festivals. In the same reign, the Church of Eglis-
Maluack, in Strathclyde, with all its rights and pertinents, is grant-
ed by the King to the monks of Kelso. From these facts, it is
supposed that the name of the church was Eglis-Maluack, whilst
the parish in general was distinguished by the appellation of Car-
luack of Carluke. The former of these names is supposed to be
