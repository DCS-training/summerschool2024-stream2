Cleugh-Heads hill, which is now planted, there are two of these
stations still very distinct, and on White- Castle knowe, in the same
range, there is one which has more the appearance of a beacon
hill of British, than of Roman origin. A Roman road also tra-
verses the parish in a northerly direction; it may be traced in some
places for several hundred yards above the level of the adjoining
ground. It appears to have led from a strong station, in the farm
of Dryfeholm, in the neighbouring parish of Dryfesdale, in the
direction towards Moffat.--Ten or twelve years ago, a gold coin of
James VI. was found in the farm of Belcot Hill; and a few months
ago a French gold coin was dug up in the garden at Dinwiddie,
Mains, of Francis I. in a good state of preservation; they are both
in the hands of Sir William Jardine.
	Modern Buildings.--The only modern buildings worthy of note
are the mansion house of Jardine-Hall, built in 1814; that of Hook
built in 1806, a property formerly belonging to Edward Armstrong,
Esq. now to John James Hope Johnston, Esq.; the parish church
erected in 1761, and the manse in 1806. There are three corn-mills
and one lint-mill. The materials employed in the erection of Jar-
dine-Hall, and the manse and church, are red sandstone, taken from
a quarry on Corncockle muir in Lochmaben parish. Hook house
is built of greenstone, from the bed of the river Dryfe, with the ex-
ception of the hewn work, which is of red sandstone.

			III.--POPULATION.
	From a minute statement in the handwriting of Mr Dugald
Simpson, minister of Applegarth, in 1696, it appears that the exa-
minable persons amounted at that period to 610. The whole po-
pulation would therefore be somewhere about 830.

		     In 1755 it amounted to   897
                     In 1777 to               943
                     But in 1792 it fell to   741
                     In 1801 it rose again to 795
                     In 1811 to               841
                     In 1821 to               943

and at last census in 1831, the population was 999. The de-
crease between the years 1777 and 1792 is attributed in the for-
mer Statistical Account, and perhaps correctly, to the system
adopted about that period by land-owners, of joining a number of
small farms into one. The incre`se since that period may be as-
cribed, partly to the improved system of husbandry creating a de-
mand for labourers, and partly to the natural progress of popula-
