The thermometer stood at 18. The greatest heat was, on August
18th, 76. Greatest cold, 1836, Navevaber the 9th, 22 1/2. The
greate heat, August 11th, 74. The greatest height of barome-
ter 1835, was 20, January 3d being 30.8 1/16, the lopwest October
26, 28.7. In 1836 barometer highest, May 14th, 30.6 3/4, lowest
October 13th 28.7 4/10.	The weather is often cols and ungenial
in March, April, and the beginning of May, the  wind being in an
east- or south-east direction.  Our highest winds in spring and
autumn are from the south-west.  The willow trees all lie from
that direction-but our greatest falls of rain and snow are invari-
ably from the east or south-east. Since 1827 until march last,
the road in winter have not been completely blocked up; and when
tbey were, difficult  to pass, this rose more from the snow being
drifted than from any serious fall. The harvest has commenced,
in this valley, since 1821, as follows
