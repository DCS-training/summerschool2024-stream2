                    PARISH OF KETTINS. *

      PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

                 I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Extent and Situation.-PART of the parish is situated in Perth-
shire, but the greater part in the western district of Forfarshire,
on the south side of the valley of Strathmore, and on the northern
declivity of the Sidlaw hills. The length from east to west is 4
miles, the breadth from south to north is 3, exclusive of Bandir-
ran, which is detached.
   There are six small villages in the parish, of which Kettins is
the largest. It is delightfully situated on a little stream, which,
after passing through Cupar-Angus, falls into the Isla. It is ge-
nerally admired by strangers as a picture of rural simplicity and
beauty. The nearly kept cottages and gardens-the village green,
situated in the centre, watered by the rivulet, and the mag-
nificent wood in which the whole is embosomed, give it much the
appearance of the beautiful hamlets in the southern counties of
England. The mansion-houses of Newhall, Beechwood, and
Hallyburton are in the immediate vicinity.
   Soil.-The soil is various. Part of the low parish, and the
greater part of the higher grounds have rather a light thin soil,
and the hills are partly covered with heathy pasture. But nearly
