     of Castletown.

Church, etc.-The church was built in 1777.  The
rain penetrates through the walls, and part of the timber
is already rotten.  The manse and offices are a heap of
ruins.  They were built on the top of a hideous precipice,
about 100 feet of perpendicular height++, where there is
not a drop of water for the use of man or beast.  The late
Mr Rutherford found a small spring about the middle of
the rock, which he endeavoured to draw up at a great
pence; the well was continually filling up, and is now en-
tirely washed away.  It is proposed to build a manse and
offices in a more agreeable situation next spring.  The
present incumbent is accommodated in the mean time with
a house a little more than two miles from the church.
The living is L. 83: 6: 8.  The value of the glebe can-
not be accurately ascertained, as an exchange of land be-
tween the Duke of Buccleugh and the minister is just com-
pleted, which will be more convenient for both parties;
at present the whole of the land is in the most wretched
condition.  A few of the inhabitants attend a Seceding
meeting house in the lower part of the parish, built about
30 years ago, and at present very much on the decline.
All the rest belong to the Established Church.

   Old Chapels.-There have been no less than 5 chapels or
churches in the parish, besides the parish church.  The Wheel
Church at the head of Liddal, Hermitage, on the river of
that name, Dinlabyre, Ettleton, and Chapel-know, on the
borders of Canonby.  Ettleton and Hermitage are still

++ Some years ago a woman going from the manse at night, fell from
the top of the precipice into the river; her thigh bone only was broken;
she is now in perfect health.
