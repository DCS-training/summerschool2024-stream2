  In every hundred acres of arable land, there may be 20 acres
in oats, 8 acres in potatoes or green crops, 2o acres in hay, 6
acres in wheat or barley, and fully one-half in pasture. There
may be in the whole parish annually about 615 acres of oats, 246
acres of potatoes, 615 acres in hay, and 184 in wheat or barley,
which, out of 3076 arable acres, leaves 1660 for white and green
crops, and 1416 for pasture, which latter amount is probably a lit-
tle below the mark.
