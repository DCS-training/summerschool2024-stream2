same as in the neighbouring parishes.-This parish pro-
duces much grain, besides what is necessary for its own
consumption.  A good deal is sent every year to Perth
and Dundee, and large quantities are exported by sea.
It is carried coastwise to Leith, and several other ports on
the Forth, and up the canal of Glasgow.  Winter and
spring are the seasons of exportation, the farmer being then
obliged to dispose of his grain.  The prices are regu-
lated by the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets, being com-
monly somewhat lower, though the grain is of the best
quality, and the measures used here exceed those at Leith,
by at least 5 per cent. which will defray the charge of trans-
portation.  There are two places at which all the grain ex-
ported from the parish is shipped off; the shore of Er-
rol, a little below the village, and of Powgavie, on the
E. point of the parish, where it joins with Inchture.  The
chief traffic carried on, is that of grain in winter, and lime
and coals in summer.  Lime is brought from different 
parts of Fife, and sold for 17 d. the boll, wheat measure, and
also from the north of England, of a superior quality, which
is to be had for 2 s. 4 d. barley measure.  Coal, which is
the fuel used in the parish, costs about 3 s. 9 d. the boll,
weighing 52 stones.  There may be 140 or 150 chaldrons
of coals delivered at the shore of Errol in a season, and 120
of lime.  The quantity of grain exported may be nearly
the same with that of the lime delivered.  A correspond-
ence is likewise kept up with London, and some other
places, whence porter, wine, sugar and wood, are frequently
received.  The proprietor of Errol has a duty upon the ar-
ticles shipped off, or landed at the harbour on his estate.  A
passage-boat goes regularly between it and the shore of
Newburgh every tide.
