rather fastnesses, seem all of them to have been completely
circular from bottom to top, prodigiously thick in the walls,
built with the largest stones they could get, without any
timber at all.  Many of them were built on eminences,
many on plains and low places, according as best suited the
design, and many surrounded with ditches or ramparts,
with outposts or redoubts, in a degree less or more.  They
are here called indiscriminately, as is commonly the case,
Pictish Houses, Druidical Temples, Repositories of the
Dead, Cairns, Toulichs.  No doubt, they had places and
houses for all these purposes, besides their strong holds and
places of strength; yet security and strength is the charac-
teristic of all their houses of what kind soever.  Those of
them that were on the greatest eminences were evidently
designed for watch-towers, whereby any alarm of danger,
or approach of an enemy, was, quick as lightning, announ-
ced to the whole country, by the rapid communication of
light from one watch-tower to another, and all these were
so stationed, as most admirably to accommodate one ano-
ther, and consequently the whole country, to the remotest
corners, as may be seen by any spectator who compares
them, their situations, and distances to one another.  This
admirable contrivance was necessary to a country exposed
so much as this was to the frequent invasion of the Danes,
and the inroads and incursions of their neighbours.
   With regard to their dwelling-houses, I cannot pass over
one or two things I observed more than once; the same is
also observable in what remains of their strong towers;
these were oblong open slits, at certain distances, all round
in the walls; before each of these slits or windows was a
lodgment, of the dimensions of a small bed.  These lodg-
ments are in the stair, which mounts spirally through the
heart of the wall from bottom to top.  The design of this
