after the corns are put into the barn-yards.  With respect to
animal productions, the country abounds in black cattle; these
are generally of a small size, but very durable; the largest will
not exceed the weight of 18 or 20 stones of 16 lb.  The num-
ber in the parish at present amounts to about 1696.  The
sheep, which are generally kept in the hilly part, are but of a
small size, some of the inhabitants, however, go yearly to the
south of Scotland, where they purchase numbers of black
faced sheep, which turn out with them to good advantage.
The precise number of sheep cannot be ascertained.  The
country abounds with muir sowl, and several gentlemen keep
shooting quarters, which they regularly attend during the
season.  Here are hares and foxes in abundance.  Ptarmigans
are also to be found at a place called Caaness, towards the head
of the parish.

   Miscellaneous Observation.-The roads are in very bad
repair, and must continue in the same state till proper over-
seers are appointed to inspect them, and the road money of
the parish appropriated to their repair.  The bridges are only
two in number (though the extent of water, from the head to
the foot of the parish, is about 25 English miles.)  Were a
bridge built centrically between these two, which are 9 miles
asunder, it would be a considerable advantage to the country
at large, and free many individuals from incoveniencies they
presently labour under.  Indeed there are some funds for a
bridge already, and subcriptions might be expected to com-
plete the scheme, were there any public spinited person to set
the work on foot.

100 merks, there is a school erected by the Society
