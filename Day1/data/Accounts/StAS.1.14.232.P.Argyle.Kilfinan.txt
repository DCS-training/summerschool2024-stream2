near the present seat of the family of Lamont, and upon
the Kyles of Bute.

   Hills, Lakes, Rivers,Woods, &c.-Although there
are many hills in this parish, there are none of remark-
able height; the most considerable are those which di-
vide this from the parish of Glendarual.  They are all
mossy, and consequently barren.  Heath and fog being 
their principal produce, is, in general, withered and 
weather-beaten.  The most of them, however, produce
one species of grass, though not in great abundance,
which is very useful for cattle in the latter end of the
season, particularly in spring, when provender generally
turns scarce; I mean moor-bent, whuch is so hard and
durable in its nature, that the severest winter has scarce-
ly any other effect upon it, than to discolour it a little.
Sheep are very fond of it in spring, and especially win-
terers, that is, cattle which are not housed at all, but
are fed without in closes all the season over; and it is
supposed to give them strength and vigour, sooner than
the finest grass upon the low ground.
   There are several small lakes, the largest of them not
much exceeding half a mile long; and all abound in yel-
low trout of no great size.  There are 4 waters, and as
many beautiful bays; but those to which nature seems
to have been most partial, are tha bays of Kilfinan and
Achlick, more especially the former, supposed by many
to be one of the prettiest situations upon Lochfine.  Up-
on these waters, there is, in times of rain, plenty of
yellow trout, weighing from 1 to 6 lb. weight.  It is
said, that, some years ago, salmon of 16 lb. weight was
often killed upon the waters of Kilfinan, and grilse very
frequently, i.e.  salmon that is supposed to want a year
