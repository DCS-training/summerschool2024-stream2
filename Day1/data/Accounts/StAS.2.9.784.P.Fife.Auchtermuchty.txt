the south-east on the road to Falkland and the New Inn, 160;
and the landward part of the parish, 293.

                         IV.-INDUSTRY.
   The parish is in a high state of cultivation, and the number of
imperial acres cultivated or in tillage is 2600 nearly. The total
extent of the parish is 2900 imperial acres, and not 3000 Scots
acres, as stated in the Old Account.
   It does not appear that any waste lands could be added to those
under tillage. There is an undivided common in the parish of
about 90 acres. The number of acres under wood is about 220,
and most of them have been planted within the last fifty years.
   Rent.-The average rent of land in this parish is very high, and
the competition for it, when out of lease, is extremely great ; but
the following statement, made from minute investigation and au-
thentic sources, will best exhibit a comparative view of its value:

        There are 300 acres, averaging L. 4 per acre,        L.1200
                  600 	                  3	               1800

                ------                                         -----
                 2600                                        L.5900
   The real rental of the parish is L.5900. In this the value of
plantations and undivided common is not included.
   Manufactures.-In the year 1817 a blight came over the ma-
nufacturing interest in this parish, which it has never recovered.
Since that time, trade, instead of being carried on by resident
manufactures, has been transacted chiefly through the medium
of agents who give out yarns to the weavers to work from manufac-
turers at Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, &c. The manufactures
consist of cotton and linen goods, or checks, and drills, as they
are called, and green linens. It is generally supposed that there
are about 700 weavers in the parish, of which one-third are females,
whose earnings average about 5s. 6d. per week.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The number of families in the parish is
nearly 750, of which Dissenters form, as near as can be ascertain-
ed, the one-half.
   The stipend of the Established clergyman is 136 bolls of meal
of 140 lb. per boll, and 99 quarters of barley, (or 17 chalders in
toto,) and L.10 in money.
   The glebe measures 8 1/2 acres imperial, and is worth L.30 per
annum. The manse was built in 1793, and is a substantial fabric.
An addition was made to it about seven years ago, and it is nnw
