that the population has varied little or nothing since 1723;
yet it appears, in fact, to have been a little on the increase,
at least since 1766.  The natives had formerly a strong at-
tachment to the place, and seldom left the parish.  Al-
though the same attachment still continues, yet the price of
labour in the low country has advanced so considerably,
within the last 20 years, as to induce several of the young men
to leave the parish; a circumstance, which will account for
the great difference, betwixt the number of men and wo-
men at present residing in it.  The return to Dr Webster,
in 1755, was 686 souls.

   Poor.-The number of poor upon the parish roll, does
not often amount to 12.  The interest of a small fund, to-
gether with the weekly collections, amounting together to
about L. 6 Sterling yearly, is divided among them; and
if at any time, one or more are bed-rid, it is customary to
hang up a bag in the mill for them, into which the tenants
put a handful of meal, when they grind their corn.  There
