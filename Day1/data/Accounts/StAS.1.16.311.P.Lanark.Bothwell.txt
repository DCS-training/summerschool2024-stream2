   By this attention to the outfield, it is observed, that the
croft has failed for some years of the great crops it used to
produce, owing to the farmer carrying all the dung and
manure he can procure to his wheat-land, as he chiefly de-
pends upon that crop for his rent.
   Barley, for the same reason, is now less cultivated, as it
interferes with the manure of the wheat; and, on account
of the binding quality of the clay, it will not grow, unless
it be cherished with refreshing showers soon after it is sown;
for this cause, it is judged a precarious crop.
   Beans, mixed with pease, used to be raised from the
croft ground in great abundance.  But in bad harvests, it
is extremely difficult to get them timely dried and slacked,
without which they are in a great measure lost.  So that
wheat, oats, and hay, are likely to be cultivated as the
surest crops.
   Potatoes are planted by every farmer, but chiefly for
private use.  Tradesmen depend much upon that valuable
root.  The hard soil is not so favourable as a tender and
quick soil for that crop.
   The clay is equally unfriendly to flax; and no more of
it is sown than is necessary for the use of each family.
   They sow in March, or as soon as the season will per-
mit, and the soil is so dry as to admit them to go upon the
fields.
   Their harvest is earlier than some of their neighbours;
especially that part of the parish which lies toward Clyde.
   After all the manure that can be applied, the goodness
of crops in this parish depends particularly upon the season.
From its declining attitude to the south, but especially from
the stiffness of the clay, it needs frequent showers, first in
the spring, to bring the grain equally through the hard
soil; and then a regular succession of showers to dissolve
the clay, else it forms an impenetrable cement, excluding
