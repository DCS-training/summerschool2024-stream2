which make up the minister's stipend are, L.80 in money, 122 1/2
bolls of meal, and 21 1/2 bolls of bear.  There is an allowance of
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements.  The glebe consists of four
Scotch acres, including the garden and the ground on which the
manse and office-houses stand.
   Education.-The parochial school and schoolhouse were erected
in 1837, on a very liberal scale, and are extremely neat and sub-
stantial, as well as commodious buildings.  The schoolmaster's
salary amounts, including the Dick Bequest, to upwards of L.60.
The fees average about L.30 annually.
   There is a school at Craigdam, endowed by a benevolent indi-
vidual of the name of Barron, with a salary of L.18 per annum
from a bequest of L.600 in the three per cents.  The trustees
are, the minister and two of the elders of the Seceder church at
Craigdam.
   There is a third school, at Barthol Chapel, in this parish, the
teacher of which has a house and croft provided for him by the
Earl of Aberdeen.  There are three other schools whose teachers
have no endowment, but depend for a poor and precarious liveli-
hood solely upon the fees paid by their pupils.
   The total number of scholars attending all these seminaries is,
on an averaoe, from 300 to 350.
   There are also several Sabbath schools in the parish, and the
minister gives instruction in the principles of Christian knowledge,
everv Lord's day before sermon, to a numerously attended class
consisting of young people.
   The number of poor on the roll is 60, among whom upwards of
L.100 is annually divided,-L.80 of which is supplied by collec-
tions in church, the remainder by occasional donations, and a small
fund, which, from the demands necessarily made upon it during
the last few years, has been rapidly diminishing.
