General Appendix to [Vol. i.

   Extent and Form of the Parish.-The present parish of Ayr
was formerly divided into two, Ayr and Alloway.  Ayr, in-
cluding the town and Borrowfield, was a collegiate charge
from the Reformation.  The other half made the separate
parish of Alloway; which, having but a small stipend, was,
about the beginning of the present century, annexed to Ayr,
and its stipend divided between the two collegiate ministers
of that parish.  The ruins of Alloway church are yet to be
seen, near the old bridge of Doon.
   The river Doon, near its mouth, has, at some former pe-

channel.  For, besides the marks of its old course, there is
now on its north side a farm of some extent, named Coning-

course than by its former channel.
   Within a quarter of a mile of its mouth, a paper mill
has been lately erected, on the south side, by David Earl of
Cassillis; and, a little above that, a fine stone bridge, of one
arch, was thrown over by his brother Thomas the 9th Earl.
This bridge is little more than half a mile below the old one;
and by them are opened two different ways of communica-

   Privileges, and Administration of the Burgh.-The town of
Ayr is the seat of the presbytery of that name; and enjoys,
with the town of Irvine, every sixth vice of the meeting of
the synod of Glasgow and Ayr, which convenes twice at
Glasgow for once that it does at either of the other two
owns.  Ayr is likewise the head burgh of the county; and has
