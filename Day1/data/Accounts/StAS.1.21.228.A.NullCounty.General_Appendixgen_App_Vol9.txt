marriage, as early as they can get a hut, and are in possession
of 5 L. sterling, or as much value.  But it is not the province
of proprietors, especially great ones, to carry on manufac-
tures; but were adventurers in that business to set up manu-
factories in this country, it is at least probable they would be
very successful.  It is true, that those of the inhabitants who
are advanced in life, would work but slowly for some time,
on account of a long habit of idleness; but the young would
go chearfully to work all at once.  It is well known that peo-
ple from this country, who are employed in other countries,
in different kinds of work, give entire satisfaction to their
employers.

   Number of lnhabitants-In the end of January last, an ac-
curate list was taken of all the souls in the parish, and the
number consisted of 1600.  There is little alteration for seve-
ral years past as to the increase or decrease of population in
this parish.  There would be an increase, were it not for
some emigrations to the south, and that some small farms
have been conjoined into a few greater ones.
     Number of marriages from 1st Feb.  1792 to Feb. 1793,
     is 12.
     Number of baptisms within the above specified time, 42.

   Number of burials, 49.  But, it is to be observed, that this
exceeds considerably the average number of deaths in the
year.  Children who died of the small-pox make a great
part of the number, and several died of those fevers which
sometimes, but not often, assault these corners.  Some years
there is not a fourth of the number of deaths, and, at an aver-
age, there will not be above one half the number.
