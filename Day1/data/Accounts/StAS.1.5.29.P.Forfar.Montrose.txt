tide of flood runs S. W. along the shore.  The two nearest
head lands are the Red-head on the south, and the Tod-
head on the north.  At the former, with off-shore winds,
the anchorage is very good.- In the beginning of this
century, however, a fleet of merchant ships, failing to a 
Dutch settlement, eith stored of all kinds, were wrecked
upon this northern coast, and one or two were lost in the 
mount of the Northesk.
