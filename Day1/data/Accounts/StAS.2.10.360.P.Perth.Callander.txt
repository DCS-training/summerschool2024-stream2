Rich crops of oats, barley, turnips, and potatoes, may be seen grow-
ing upon places, which, a few years ago, were covered with barren
heath, or so swampy that the cattle could not get access to the
few tufts of grass that might appear here and there.  Still there
remains much to be done, a great deal of land is to be seen lying
waste, and in a state of nature, which at a little expense might be
brought into cultivation, and abundantly repay all trouble and
outlay.
   The attention paid by graziers to the breed of cattle has great-
ly promoted improvement in this respect, and several farms in the
parish are noted for the excellence of stock, both of black cattle
and sheep.  Great attention is paid to the smearing of sheep in
the beginning of winter, and selecting proper places in the low
country for the wintering of the hogs, so that both the carcase of
the animal, and quality of the wool are benefited thereby.  The
wool is sent to Bannockburn, Glasgow, and Liverpool, and bought
by the carpet-manufacturers.  Although much has been done by
some of the proprietors in the way of planting, there is still a great
deal of waste land unfit for tillage, which, if planted, would both
beautify the face of the country, and enhance the value of proper-
ty.  Considerable improvement has taken place within these few
years in the management of the police of the country; yet there
are many crimes allowed to pass with impunity.  Would it not
tend much to diminish crime if there were fewer licenses granted
for selling, spirits, and more attention paid to the character of the
persons to whom licenses are given?
