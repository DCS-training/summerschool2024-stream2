secured, and every means observed for preserving the health, and
promoting the comfort, of the prisoners. The jailor, is under the
superintendence of one of the bailies of the town by turns. The
number of persons confined in the jail, during the year 1831, was
55, of whom 46 were imprisoned for debt, 6 for theft, and 3 for
desertion of service.
	Fairs.--Of these there are two held in the parish. Whatever
may have been the business transacted at them formerly, the whole
is now confined to the sale chiefly of ready-made shoes, sweet-
meats, &c.; while, in the evening, the public houses are crowded
with the idle and intemperate.
	Inns and Alehouses.--Of these there were, in 1832, within the
royalty, 85; in the parish, without the royalty, 10; total within the
parish 95. Thus there is in the parish, on an average, one public
house, or place where spirituous liquors are sold, to every 18 fa-
milies, or to every 40 individuals, of the population of both sexes,
above 20 years. We have already said that a very large portion
of the misery which afflicts the labouring classes may be traced to
habits of intemperance. And nne of the causes of the prevalence
of this vice may fairly be ascribed to the number of public houses
which are licensed.
	Fuel.--The fuel made use of in the parish is coal, imported
by sea from the counties of Durham and Northumberland. Coal
is likewise imported from the Firth of Forth, chiefly for the use of
large manufacturing establishments, where steam is employed as
the moving power.
