In manners, the inhabitants of the parish are civil and discreet,
and their external deportment is decent and respectful. They are
inquisitive and fond of knowledge, and reaching occupies a conside-
rable portion of their leisure time. What relates to politics and re-
ligion chiefly engages their attention, in this way. They are fond
of speculation in the one, and of controversy in the other./f*  Notwith-
standing, they are good and peaceable subjects, and live together in
friendly and Christian intercourse.

  Rent of Land.-The land rents are different in different parts.
On the coast and about the town L.5, and even L.6 per acre are no-
thing uncommon to pay for land. Further back, and a little way
up the country, the rent may be from L.2, 10s. to L.3 per acre,
and in the more remote parts, the land rents are as low as L. 1, 1Os.
and L. 1. The average of the whole may be I. 2, 10s. The
valued rental of the parish is L. 798, 9s. 9d. The real rental may
be about L. 7500.
   Husbandry.-The rotation of crops generally practised is sum.-
mer fallow or potatoes, after which comes wheat, then beans dril-
led and hoed, or grass pastured two years, or the first year hay,
and the second pasture. Grass is generally succeeded by a crop
of oats. The rotation, however, necessarily varies according to cir-
cumstances, and the taste of the grower; but, with a very few excep-
tions, the alternate cultivation of leguminous and culmiferous crops is
strictly adhered to; and so superior, indeed, is this method of cropping
to that anciently used, of taking successive corn crops, until poverty

<FOOTNOTE>Within these few years, several controversial writings on religious topics have
been given to the world from this parish, exhibiting powers of composition not to be
expected fromp ersons in the situations of their authors. Itiscertainly to be regret-
ted. however, for themselves and families, that a love of idle and useless disputation,
should call off the attention of individuals from their honest and lawfid vocations.
