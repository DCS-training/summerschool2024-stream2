cern in the river, the burn being always rapid, all of them
must keep close to the edge.  Here it is necessary to re-
mark, that when they come to the mouth of a burn or ri-
vulet, so many swim up these streams, and the rest proceed
in their course up the river.  I am informed, that they can
by instinct distinguish those burns and rivulets which have
their source in lakes, morasses, or peat-mosses, from those
streams which derive their chief supply from fountains;
and that the latter are little frequented by them.  They
go up Culter burn in great numbers, and proceed up Leu-
char burn, a branch of it, to the loch of Skene.  They re-
turn in harvest; and the particular time of their regress
varies likewise, according to the nature of the season.  In
different years it may be variously reckoned from the last
week of August to the end of October; some of them are
at this time an ell in length.  These have probably conti-
nued in the loch or burn more than one season, for their
length in general does not exceed two feet.  Tenants who
live on the banks of a burn sometimes build a fish-garth,
or dam, with an opening to receive a kind of osier basket,
or what they call an hose-net for catching fish.  They catch
some trout and some pike, but eels in great abundance, at
the season of their returning to the sea, and sometimes
cure them in large earthen jars, or in small casks for win-
ter provision.  I have been told that, in the beginning of
summer, the young eels are to be seen in the river in
shoals, filling the water, like the herring, from top to bot-
tom; this I have never observed.  But when a strong flood
and contrary wind retard their progress, many of them go
up small rivulets, and more of them than would fill a
bushel or two are sometimes collected at the foot of a bank
or precipice; many of these cannot return to the river,
and serve for food to due and other aquatics, or any pis-
civorous animals.  For the causes, the eels may be col-
