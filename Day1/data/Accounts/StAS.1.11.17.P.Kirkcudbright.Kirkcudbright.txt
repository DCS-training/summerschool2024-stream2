they have collected, during the quarter, among the poor of
the landward parish.  As each of them collects at their own
particular doors of the church, their funds by this means are
kept quite separate.  This practice has existed ever since the
union of the parishes, and no doubt took its rise, from a sus-
picion entertained by the heritors of the landward parish, that
if their collections, for the support of the poor, were con-
founded with those of the town, they would be swallowed up
by the numerous beggars that generally frequent country
towns and burghs.  Time has shewn that their fears were not
groundless; for the poor upon the town's roll are 5 times
more in number, than those upon the roll of the country
parish.

   Kirkcudbright United Society.-In this town a society was
constituted, in the year 1783, by a few persons, under the
designation of the United Society of Kirkcudbright.  The sole
object of this society is to relieve the distressed, by preventing
their want of subsistence while in sickness, and, in case of death,
to defray the expences of their funerals.  It extends also to the
relief of the widows and orphans of deceased members.  Ac-
cording to the regulations of this society, each member pays,
upon his admission, 6 s. 6 d., and 1 s. per quarter He must
be 5 years a member of this society, before he can receive any
benefit from the funds.  In sickness he receives 3 s. per week
till he is recovered; and, at death, his widow or heir receives
1 L. 10 s. to defray the expences of his funeral.  The widow
of a deceased member receives a certain sum yearly; and, in
case there is no widow, the children receive what the would
have drawn, until the youngest is 12 years old.  This so-
ciety, which was established at first by a few well disposed
persons, for the laudable purposes already mentioned, has now
increased in number, from 10 or 12, to no less than 126 mem-
