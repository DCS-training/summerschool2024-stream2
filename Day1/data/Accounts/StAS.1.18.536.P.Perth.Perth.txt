which, was given to the Dominican monastery at Perth, by

for the soul of his mother Elizabeth More, "who was resting
"in the church of the predicatory Friars of Perth."
   3. The chapel of St Ann, mother of the Virgin Mary, si-

secrated to various saints, and each of the altars had one offi-
ciating chaplain, or more, when more than one saint was
honoured at the same altar; and generally, each of these
chaplains had about L. 10 in the year.
