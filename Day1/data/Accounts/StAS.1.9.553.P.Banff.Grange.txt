two-thirds of the cultivated ground in the parish to the N.

clay, upon a till bottom, or a spungy mossy soil.  The air of
the parish is moist, owing not only to the wetness of the

which attracts the clouds as they pass from the Moray Frith,
and make them discharge their contents in torrents upon

names derived from the Gaelic, (which are not many,)
must have been first inhabited; because that language was
universal in Scotland till after the Norman Conquest of
England, when the tyranny of the Conqueror, occasioned
the flight of great numbers of Anglo-Saxons into Scotland,
who, obtaining settlements in the low country, along the
east coast of Scotland, introduced their language, which
