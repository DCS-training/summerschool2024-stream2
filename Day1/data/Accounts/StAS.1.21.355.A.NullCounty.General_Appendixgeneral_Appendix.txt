becomes still more valuable for machinery; having very great
falls at every short distance, and an excellent road, already
formed, along its banks to the Highlands: and were water
carriage opened so far as Callander, the additional land car-
riage to the public works erected beyond that village would
be trifling.
   In short, the river Teith, in the view of manufactures, is
excelled by very few in Scotland: and yet it is almost totally
neglected, chiefly for the want of coal and lime; and it must
continue so while the high price of the carriage of these arti-
cles lasts.
   To the inhabitants of the districts under consideration, na-
vigable canals are objects of very great importance; and if
they have any love for the prosperity of these interesting
districts, the navigation of the Forth and Teith ought to be
their first step.
   If the lessening of land carriage occupied so much of the
attention of the public in 1774, it ought much more so the
attention of the people of the present time.  The extraordi-
nary improvements in agriculture, and the increase of Scotch
manufactures since 1774, must now render land carriage an
important article.  The astonishing rise of land rents, the
improvement of the highways, the elegance of buildings,
and the general appearance of the country, are sufficient
proof of our increased prosperity and wealth.  But this al-
teration must have naturally increased the expence of land
carriage; and were navigation extended, the effect would be
at once obvious.
   A manufacturer will never think of erecting extensive
works in a district where land carriage is so expensive and
coals so scarce.  Betwixt Callander and Lochlubnaig, mills
could be erected and supplied with water the whole year
rotund, that might employ upwards of 20,000 workmen,
