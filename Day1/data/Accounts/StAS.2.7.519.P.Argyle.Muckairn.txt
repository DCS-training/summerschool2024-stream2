		              III.-POPULATION.
	There are no accounts of the population on record here previ-
ous to the year 1801.
<TABLE>

	In 1801, the population was		893
                   1811,        873
                   1821,        831
                   1831,        770
                   1841,        812

	When the last census was taken, the number of males was 386,
and of females, 426 ; but, besides these, there were about 50
males absent from the parish when the census was taken, thus
making the actual population 860. The increase since 1831 may.
arise from more workmen being wanted for employment in the
woods, and at the Lorn Furnace Company.
	The average of births for the last seven years, as appears from
the records, is 14 8/7 and of marriages, 4 1/7. No register of deaths
is kept.

	The average number of persons under 15 years of age in 1831 was,	300
                                                    15 to 30,       174
                                                    30 to 50,       142
                                                    50 to 70,       120
                                         upwards of 70,              34
                                                                   _____
                                                                    770

	There are no resident noblemen, or families of independent for-
tune, residing in the parish, and but two proprietors of land of the
yearly value of L.50.
	There were, in 1831, 13 males unmarried, and 20 women un-
married who were upwards of forty-five years of age, and three in-
sane persons.
	The social condition of the parish is not, to any very marked ex-
tent, inferior to that of the neighbouring districts, and the same ob-
servation applies, perhaps, to their religious and moral state. It
should be mentioned, however, that, so far back as the year 1753
and 1757, a great part of the district of Muckairn was let in lease
to an English Company for the sake chiefly of its woods, which
are manufactured into charcoal, used in making pig-iron. The
ore is imported from Lancashire, smelted with the charcoal, and
the iron thus obtained is considered equal in quality to any made
in the kingdom. But the employment of a great proportion of the
population during a considerable portion of the year at the smelt-
ing, furnace, and, in the case of both sexes, in the woods, is the
reverse of favourable to the observance of the, Sabbath, to purity
of morals, or to due attendance to religious instruction and religi-
ous duties. The expiration of the lease will take place in 1863.
