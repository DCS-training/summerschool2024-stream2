twenty to thirty acres have been added, within the last fifteen years,
by tenants. Two or three farms, being retained for sometime
in the proprietor's own hand, have been considerably improved;
but tenants have done, and are still doing, much. There is ample
scope for improvement here; and the want of capital, and of en-
couragement by proprietors in aiding to drain and lime, are the
reasons why so much ground, quite capable of profitable improve-
ment, still lies waste. Viscount Arbuthnott, to whom a small cor-
ner of this parish belongs, has given good encouragement to his
tenant; and it appears not only in the improved face of the farm,
but in the increased quantity and quality of its produce.
        Produce.-In stating the amount of the raw produce, exactness
and accuracy can hardly be attained. The utmost to be expected
is only an approximation. A general view of it may be stated as
follows, taking the sixth shift as an average:

                        V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
        Market-Town.-No town nor village in the parish. The near-
est principal market-town is Montrose, distant from the centre of
the parish about eleven miles, to which most of the grain and dairy
produce of this parish is carried for sale. But of late, a regular
grain market has been established at the royal burgh of Bervie,
distant only about five miles, where a good deal of grain from this
Parish is sold, and frequently shipped at Gourdon, a small fishing
village near Bervie.
        Means of Communication.-The post-office nearest to this pa-
rish is Laurencekirk, where a foot-post arrives every morning from
Montrose, and departs for the same every afternoon. It is distant
about two and a-half miles from the centre of this parish. The
access to and through this parish was long difficult, both on ac-
count of the steepness of its surface and the wetness of its soil, and
therefore long retarded all improvement. The only roads through
the parish, about fifty years ago, were literally cart-roads; the only
operation of forming they had ever undergone, having been that of
