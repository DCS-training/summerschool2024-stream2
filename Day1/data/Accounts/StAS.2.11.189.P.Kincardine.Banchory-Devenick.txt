by which a duty of 10 per cent. is levied upon the poorest and
most deplorably destitute class of the population.
	Public-houses.--Notwithstanding every endeavour on the part
of the minister, and of the most influential beritors of the parish,
to get rid of the nuisance of public-bouses, we have still eight in
the parish, none of which can be said to be necessary, but the one
at Bourtrybush, the half-way house between Stonehaven and
Aberdeen. There are indeed two others,--one in each of the greaty
fishing villages of Findon and Portlethen, for which, being situat-
ed on a rocky coast where wrecks sometimes obcur, there is a plau-
sible pretext.
	Fuel.--Although there are extensive peat mosses in the Kincar-
dineshire district of the parish, coals are consumed in considerable
quantities by all classes, and are unquestionably the cheapest, fuel.
	Revised March 1838.
