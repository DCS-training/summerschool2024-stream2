     Statistical Account

four English miles to the eastward, quite detached by a part
of the parish of Borthwick, and insulated by the parishes
of Borthwick and Newbattle.  It consists of about 300
acres of clay soil.  I do not know how it became annexed
to this parish.

   Climate.-From the situation the air is cold; the frost
sets in early in the season, and continues late in the spring;
at other times the air is damp, occasioned by the hills at-
tracting the showers, and the moss retaining the moisture.
So much is this the case, that the parish never suffers from
want of rain, yet the people are in general healthy.

   Soils.-The arable part of the infield land consists of light
soil, chiefly dry and sharp, upon a gravel bottom; the
other parts of the parish consist of land of the same quali-
ties; of mossy land of from three inches to two feet deep
of moss, chiefly wet, upon a clay or gravel bottom; and
of marshy land, the soil of which is a mixture of clay and
sand, upon a bottom of moss, or clay, or gravel.

   Population and Price of Labour.-The number of souls,
from a list taken in 1793, was 593; since that time it has
diminished, from the coal not being wrought now upon the
lands of Stobs, the property of James Dewar, Esq; of Vo-
grie; but there is a prospect of the number being again
filled up, from a manufacture being about to be established
in the same place.  Like other parishes in similar situations,
the number of inhabitants has greatly decreased within 40
years.  From a list of the examinable persons, or of those
upwards of eight years of age, taken in the year 1772,
their number amounted to 604; and in the year 1755, ac-
cording to Dr Webster's statement, their number amount-
ed to 905.
