           The increase since 1801 has been mostl in the town popula-
        tion, and probably may be thus accounted for. The work people,
        employed in a manufactory of woollen cloth, established since that
        time in the immediate vicinity of Elgin, though not in the parish,
        have their residence in the town.  The extensive public and pri-
        vate buildings carried on, quarrying, road-making, and other job
        work, have induced many labourers to settle from different parts of the
        country, and not a few respectable families have been attracted by
        the acknowledged mildness of the climate and the excellence of the
        seminaries for male and female education.  The increase on the
        landward population since 1793 has only been 23.

           Language.-The dialect of the lowlands  of Moray has no dis-
        tinguishing peculiarity, except an  occasional substitution of w for
        v, as weal for veal, wery for very.  A more extended education and
        better qualified instructors have  of late generally improved the
        language of the operative classes.
           Habits and Character.-In the cottages of the small farmer and
        labourer, and in the apartments of the journeyman artisan, there
        is a marked improvement in cleanliness and comfort, and the same
        is observable in their dress and mode of living.  It may be truly
        said that the people enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts and
        advantages of society.  In so numerous a population there is no
        doubt considerable diversity of character, but it may be stated ge-
        nerally that they are intelligent and industrious, decent in deport-
        ment, and attentive to their social and religious duties.  Offences
        against the excise laws are become extremely rare; but convictions
        for poaching are by no means uncommon.
           During the last three years, there have been  21 illegitimate,
        births in the parish.

                                IV.-INDUSTRY.
           The trade carried on in Elgin is mostly confined to retail. The
        shopkeepers and artisans, supply the inhabitants of the town and

        <FOOTNOTE>With all the care taken to makes the record accurate, it is probable that there
        were a few more births than those registered; and it has been already stated that the
        burials recorded are those only that take place in the cathedral burying-ground.
