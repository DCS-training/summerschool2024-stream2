Virgin, with the Holy Child in her arms, stood in a niche
above them.  This bust was dug out of the ruins some
years ago, and given to Mr David Martin, painter and an-
tiquarian.  There are also the ruins of the church, and
what appears to have been a small chapel upon the end of
a house, within the precincts of the Abbey, where Lord
Balmerino sometimes resided.  This Abbey was begun by
Alexander II. and his mother Emergarda, daughter to the
Earl of Baumont, and widow of William, sirnamed the
Lion, in the year 1229 This lady in the year 1215, pur-
chafed the lands of Balmurenach, Cultrach, and Balin-
dean, from Richard de Rule, for 1000 merks Sterling,
upon which ground they founded the monastry near the
shore, about 8 English miles above where the Tay emp-

situated upon the banks of the Tay, noted for their roman-

tiful view of the river, with Dundee, and the rich vale of
the Carse of Gowry on the opposite shore.  It has a small
running water to the east of it, which turns a mill, and
run, through a den or glen, well stocked with venerable
trees, consisting of ash, beech, elm, &c.  In the old garden
there is a chesnut-tree, the bole of which measures 15 feet
in the girth, and not above 5 feet to the setting out of the
branches, two of which run horizontally the whole length
of the chapel, formerly mentioned, standing at the end of
the house.  A beech tree was measured to 12 feet 7 inch-

from 30 to 40 feet.  It is well sheltered from the north-
east wind by the Scurr hill, which rises to a great height
above the river, has Naughton on the east, and Birkhill on
the west, both of them modern houses, with rising pleasure
grounds of considerable extent.  At this last place there is,
besides some extensive plantations lately made, a consider-
