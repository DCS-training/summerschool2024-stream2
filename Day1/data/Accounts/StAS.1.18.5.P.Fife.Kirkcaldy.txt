   Aspect of the Parish.-On the other side of the town, the
country immediately joins it, and rises by a gentle but varied
ascent, almost to the opposite extremity of the parish.-
Taking the parish by itself, the face of it presents little to the
view that claims particular notice.  In the vicinity of the
town, where the soil is light and dry, and very susceptible of
cultivation, the fields are in general inclosed, and in a regu-
lar course of tillage; and exhibit an appearance in no small
degree pleasing.-Farther back, the ground has been more
recently brought into culture; and the soil appears to be
less kindly in its nature, and less susceptible of improve-
ment.  But an extensive proprietor, Mr Oswald of Dunni-
keer, having now built a mansion house on a fine command-
ing site, in the center of the grounds which are at present
the least cultivated*, the plan of cultivation and of ornament
which he has begun, will soon improve the appearance of
that part of the parish.  In the prospect of building, that
gentleman sometime ago inclosed and planted a romantic val-
ley, which stretches from the east end of Kirkaldy towards
the site of his new house.  This valley is now beginning to
be closely and beautifully wooded: Fanciful walks, partly of
turf, and partly of gravel, are cut through it in different di-
rections.  To these the more respectable inhabitants of the
town are indulged with access; and enjoy in this respect
an advantage which the vicinity of few towns can furnish.

   Relative Situation.-If this parish, taken by itself, affords
but little to admire in its general appearance, the defect is
abundantly supplied by its relative situation.-Commanding
from different points, a full prospect of the adjacent coun-
try, from Dysart on the east, to the green-toped hills of
