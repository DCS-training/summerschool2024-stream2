found to answer all the purposes of that useful mineral.  On
the lands of Dalmore have been found some strata of copper
and antimony; which, from experiments already made, pro-
mise to be productive of these metals, and at some future pe-
riod may probably be wrought to advantage.  No limestone has
yet been found in this parish, though, from its abundance in
some part of the country not far distant, there is a probability
that the agriculture of the district may be still farther encouraged
by the discovery of that article.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In 1755, the number of souls
in this parish was 369, now it is increased to 518.-The church
was lately repaired, and is in good order.  There is no manse

When he was first settled, the tenants and labourers were poor,

turnpike roads in the parish; and three bridges over the water
of Air; one of which was built in 1745 at a very considerable
expence: another of them, erected at the private cost of
the late Sir Thomas Miller, Lord President of the Session,
near his house of Barskimming, consists of one arch, spring-
ing on each side from a perpendicular rock above 40 feet high.
This, with his extensive plantations, and other improvements
along the banks of the rivers, aided by the romantic beauty of
