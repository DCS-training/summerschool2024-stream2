ease that prevails most in the parish; and, since people have
ceased to wear flannel shirts, it is become much more gene-
ral.  The prejudices, entertained by the inhabitants of this
parish against inoculation, were, for a long time, invincible.
But the better fort, setting the example, the rest gradually
followed:-for we are fond to imitate our superiors.  Yet
there are some who still say, "That, to inoculate for the
"small-pox, is to tempt Providence." In one season, 460

the dropsy is become pretty common, particularly among
the poorer fort of people.  This is ascribed to their feeding
so much upon potatoes, which is now become a substitute for

as a disgrace, to this quarter of the island, is but rarely seen
now, even among the lowest classes of the people.  This,
doubtless, is owing to their living in a more cleanly manner
than their forefathers.  But this distemper is not peculiar to
a Highlander,-nor to a Scotch man.  It is a plant which
grows in countries south of the Tweed, else there would be
no word to express it in the English tongue; and it is well

der that is a disgrace to human nature.  Her father, who had been a stranger
to the nature of her complaint, spoke to the incumbent about her;-and upon
