                 III.-THE POPULATION.

   The earliest account of the population occurs in the return to
the Rev. Dr Webster in 1755, when it amounted to 905.  Seven-
teen years later, the examinable persons (above eight years of age)
were found to be 604.

The population, according to the Parliamentary returns, was, in 1801,    801
                                                                1811,   1058
                                                                1821,   1156
   In 1831, the population reached to 1255, being 652 male and 603 females.
   The greatest increase in the population has taken place at Gore-
bridge, caused by the erection of extensive works for the manufac-
ture of gunpowder.
   The village of Gorebridge contains about 300, and Temple
about 200: the remaining population is scattered over the different
farms.
   The yearly average of births recorded for the seven years pre-                   .
ceding 1835, is 26 5/7, and of marriages, 8. No register is ke
the mortality.
   The only resident proprietor is William Tait, Esq.
   Arniston House the residence of the distinguished family of
Arniston, borders on the parish; but only the grounds and garden
attached to it are situated in it,

                        IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-The trees planted are mostly oak ash, elm, beech,
and various kinds of pine. About 100 acres are under wood.
   Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land is about L. I
per acre; grazing cattle for six months from L, 2 to. 1, 4 a head.
   Wages.-Labourers receive wages about 1s. 6d. a day on an
average throughout the year.
   Husbandry is carried on according to the most improved methods.
A part of waste land has has recovered ; but the price of grain
is now so reduced, that it is unreasonable to expect an agriculturist
wil1 consume his means by improving, while so small a remuneration
is held out for his encouragement.  Irrigation is not practised to
any extent. Nineteen years is the general duration of leases.
Farm-buildings and enclosures are generally in a state of good
repair. It may be mentioned that the principal enclosure is the
dry stone dike.
