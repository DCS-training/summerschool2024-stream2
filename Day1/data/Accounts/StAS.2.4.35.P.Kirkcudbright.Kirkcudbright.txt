triffing. The depositors are principally servants, both male and
female, mechanics, and children of the middle class.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--During the last year the roll con-
tained the names of 130 permanent paupers, with 30 who received
occasional assistance. The poor are relieved principally by church
collections, interest of money mortified for their use, and alms dis-
tributed in private. The church collections amounted last year to
L. 140, 8s. 6d. ; contributions from heritors and burgh, L.80 ; mor-
tifications, &c. L.381, 17s.; total, L. 259, 5s.d.* It is impossible
to estimate the sum bestowed in private charity. The allowance
of each pauper from the sessional fund varies from 12s. to L. 6
annually. There are several charities, foundations, and mortifica-
tions, where the magistrates and members of the town-council are
sole trustees.
	The poor in general evince little delicacy in applying for paro-
chial relief: they do not consider it degrading to solicit charity.
	Prison.--The numberof persons committed to the prison of
Kirkcudbright from 1st April 1842 to 1st April 1843, was 85
criminals and 15 debtors. The offences or crimes for which the
criminals were committed are the following:

The prison is pretty well secured, though it is only partially sur-
rounded by a wall.
	Proper means are used for preserving the health of the prison-
ers. Each is comfortably clothed, and receives three meals a-day
of plain, but wholesome food. Their hands and faces are washed

<FOOTNOTE>The poor receive the rent of a house of about L.200 value, bestowed upon them
by the late Robert Lennek, Esq. of Now York.
