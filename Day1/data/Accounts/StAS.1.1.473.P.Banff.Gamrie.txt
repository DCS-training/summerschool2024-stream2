and 40 broad, from which there is a subterraneous passage to
the sea, about 80 yards long, through which the waves are
driven with great violence in a northerly storm, and occasion
a smoke to ascend from the den.  Hence it has got the name
of Hell's Lumb, i. e. Hell's Chimney.  3. Another subter-
raneous passage, through a peninsula of about 150 yards
long from sea to sea, through which a man can with difficulty
creep.  At the north end of this narrow passage is a cave a-
bout 20 feet high, 30 broad, and 150 long, containing not
less than 90,000 cubic feet.  The whole is supported by im-
mense columns of rock, is exceedingly grand, and has a won-
derfully fine effect, after a person has crept through the nar-
row passage.  This place has got the name of the Needle's
Eye.  There are in the parish several tumuli.  Not many
years ago, one of them, in the neighbourhood of Macduff,
was opened; and there was found in it an urn, containing a
considerable number of small human bones.

   Population.-The population of the parish is nearly double
since the year 1732.  At the above period the parish con-
tained 1600 souls, and now nearly 3000.  About the years
1704 and 1705, it appears by the Registers that the number
of births annually, at an average, were then 45; and, for se-
veral years past, they have not been under 60.  The number
of deaths cannot be ascertained so far back.  About 30 years
ago they were from 10 to 12, and for 7 years past nearly 20
annually.  About 30 years ago there were from 12 to 14
marriages annually, and, for 7 years past, not less than 26.

   In this parish, many instances of longevity might be men-
tioned.  It is only a few years since a fisherman in Macduff
died at the age of 109; and there are living at present several
persons 90 years old and upwards.  Mr Wilson is in his 97th
