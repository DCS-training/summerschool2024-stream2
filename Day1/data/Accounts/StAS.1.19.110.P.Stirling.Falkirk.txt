     Statistical Account

minated at Old Kirkpatrick, Dumbarton was probably a
fort belonging to the Romans; and we know, that on the
east coast their forts and stations were carried far beyond
the end of the wall*.
   This wall, or rather defensive work, consisted of a ditch
on the north, and a wall on the south.  It varies as to the
breadth of the ditch; but is never less than 12 or 15 feet
wide, and the wall was about 12 feet thick at the founda-
tion+.  The ditch was deep in proportion to its breadth;
and the wall was high in proportion to its width.  Not-
withstanding what has been said by some authors, no part
of this wall appears to have been built of stone, except in
swampy places, where the nature of the ground required
it.  Forts or stations, and between these, turrets or watch-
towers, were erected for the accommodation of soldiers to
defend it; and as they were at no great distance from one
another, a general alarm could be given at the approach of
danger.  Hence the vulgar belief that the wall was hollow,
and that the sound of a trumpet which was blown at one
end could be heard at the other.  Castlecary, Roughcastle,
and Camelon, were the most remarkable forts or stations in
this neighbourhood.  The site of the two former are still to
be seen.
   Much light has been thrown on the history of this wall
by stones with inscriptions, which have been dug up in va-
rious parts of it.  A considerable number of these stones
are in the College of Glasgow, etc.; one in Sir John Clerk's
collection, mad one in Callander house, with the following
inscription:
     VEXI
     LEG XX
     PRIMIO

+The ditch in Callander park is above 40 feet wide; in some other
places it is not so much by half.
