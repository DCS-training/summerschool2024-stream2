   Remarkable Places.-STRUTHERS, or as it is called in
some old papers, Auchter-uther-Struther, formerly the seat 
of the Earls of Crawfurd, stands a mile and a half south 
west from the village of Ceres.  The house is old, with 
towers and battlements, which give it a venerable and a 
sort of warlike appearance.-In the description of Fife, in 
Cambden's Britannia, Struthers is said to derive its name 
from the number of reeds growing around it.  There is,
indeed, a wet meadow to the south of the house, but no 
reeds are now to be seen.  The park around the house, in-
closed with a stone wall, contains about 200 acres of 
ground; there are a good many trees in different places of 
the park, particularly some venerable beeches of a very 
large size. 
   Upon the estate of Scot's Tervit, or as some write it,
Scotstarvet, (the property, from which Miss Scott takes 
her title), there is  beautiful tower of free stone, well hewn
and nicely jointed.  This tower is about 24 feet square, and
about 50 or 60 feet high.  It stands upon an eminence, and
is seen at a great distance in different directions.  It has
evidently been intended of a place of strength; the walls
are thick, and the few windows in it are very small.  The 
tower is formed by one losty vault, on the top of another;
upon the top of the uppermost, which is surrounded with a
battlement, there is an apartment covered with slate.  The
tower stands a mile and a half west from the village of
Ceres.
   CRAIGHALL, now in ruins, formerly the seat of Sir
Thomas Hope, already mentioned, (from whom the prin-
cipal families in Scotland of the name of Hope are descend-
ed,) continued to be the residence of Sir Thomas's heirs,
till the beginning of the present century; and it stands half
a mile S. E. of Ceres, upon the north bank of a beuatiful
den, planted with trees; and is sheltered on the north by a
