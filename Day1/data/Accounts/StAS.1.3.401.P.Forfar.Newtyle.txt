nearly as 1 to 118.  The proportion between the annual
deaths, and the whole population, is nearly as 1 to 49.

   Rent, Agriculture, etc.-There are about 1600 acres of
arable land in the parish.  These are divided into 15 large
farms, which are let at from 80 l. to near 200 l.; and 6
small, which draw from 6 l. to 12 l. a year.  The average
rent of the best arable land is from 17 s. 6 d. to 20 s.; and
of inferior land, 10 s. or 12 s. per acre.  Some of the farms
might draw 3 l. or 4 l. per acre, if they were near a town.
What is esteemed the best plan of farming here, is to have a 
farm divided into four parts, and to lay down one fourth in 
clover and rye-grass, another in oats, another in turnips, po-
tatoes, and pease; and another in barley, and grass sown with
it; and so in rotation.  Very little wheat, and scarcely any
hemp, are raised.  There are 59 ploughs, many of which la-
bour but small portions; and there are 106 carts.  The pa-
rish supplies itself with provisions, and exports a considerable
quantity of grain, particularly barley.  Wheat is sown in
September and October, oats in March and April, and barley
generally in May.  Harvest, for the most part, is in Septem-
ber and October.  There are more than 800 acres of hills,
morasses, etc. all divided among the  tenants.  Some good 
marl is found in the parish.  No land has been sold in it for
a considerable number of years past.

   Language.-English is spoken here in the Scotch dialect.
Names of places are chiefly derived from the English; but
there are also instances of derivation from the Gaelic.  Auch-
tertyre, the name of a farm here, seems to be Gaelic; Uach-
dair Tir, i.e. the head or the upper part of the good land;
its situation being at the foot of the Sidlie hills.  Kinpurney,
