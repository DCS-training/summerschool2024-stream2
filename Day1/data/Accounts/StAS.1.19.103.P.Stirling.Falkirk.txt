appear, if there was any alarm, that they intended to at-
tack the King's camp on the left; but, in the mean time,
the principal body of their forces were led straight for-

to their memory; and the circumstances of their death are
recorded by suitable inscriptions.  The number of forces
which were led to action that day was about 6000 of the
royal party, and perhaps somewhat more of those in the
