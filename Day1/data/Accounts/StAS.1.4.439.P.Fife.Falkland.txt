Leslie and Portmoak.-The soil, as well as the surface, is
considerably diversified.  Part is of a light brown loam,
upon a red bottom, part a light black sand, with a mixture
of moss, and in the plain or flat of Falkland Park; already
mentioned, part of it is barren sand and gravel, covered
with short heath and furze, but a greater part of it deep
black moss, generated from the oak and other timber which
grew there, when it was inclosed for a hunting park to
royal sportsmen, some of which hath been cultivated at
great expence, and the rest is lying in its natural state.
That track of land which extends almost the whole length

needs only proper culture to produce both sure and luxu-

of Falkland, and that track which stretches along the foot
of the hill, both to the east and west.  For, on the one hand,
the Lomonds attract the moist vapours floating in the sur-

in showers.  On the other hand, the creeping fogs which

attracted by the water of Eden, intersecting the valley be-
tween Falkland and Auchtermuchty, and by the planting
and marshy ground, settle there, and leave the air more dry
and pure on the rising ground, or that part of the parish
which is most populous.  In general, therefore, the inhabi-
