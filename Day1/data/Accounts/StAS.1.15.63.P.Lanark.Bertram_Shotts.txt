     of Shotts.

   Antiquities.-There is upon the great road, immediately
below the church, a copious fountain of excellent water,
known by the name of Cate's or Kate's Well.  This name it no
doubt got from St. Catharine to whom it was dedicated.  A-
bout a mile South-West from the kirk, there is a small conical
mount, called Laws-castle.  This name seems to indicate, that
some fortress had once flood upon it; but if there ever did,
there is no vestige of it now remaining, except perhaps
quantity of stones of enormous weight and size.
   Character of the People.-Although there are 10 houses
licenced to sell malt and spiritous liquors of home manu-
facture, they are chiefly supported by the travellers on the
great road.  Even in those parts of the parish, where public
houses abound most, intemperance is not a prevailing vice.
The people, with a few exceptions, are industrious and so-
ber.  Since the present minister's connection with Shotts,
and he believes for many years before that period, criminal
prosecutions have been unknown, one prosecution for mur-
der excepted, where the libel was not proven.  Each, it
would appear, sober and contented with the fruits of his own
industry, feels but little of those passions whose indulgence
terminate in ignominy and death.
   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The perfect command of
suel is the principal advantage which the inhabitants of this
parish enjoy.  It is rather surprising that this circumstance,
connected with so easy an intercourse between Glasgow and
Edinburgh, has not, long ere now, paved the way to the in-
troduction and growth of manufactures in Shotts.  This,
however, had not trade lately received so severe a check by
the war, would in all probability loon have been the case.
The fields of moss with which, for two miles on each side
of the great road, this parish is intersected, are a disadvantage
from which the proprietors of Shotts can promise themselves
