government of the burgh;"--to "hold a weekly public market
and two free fairs yearly for the space of eight days;"--to  "re-
ceive and uplift the customs and duties thereof, and apply the same
to the common good of the burgh;"--and in general to "es-
tablish such regulations as may he most conducive to the general
good of the town and its inhabitants, the advancement of trade, and
the encouragement of manufactures therein."  The town seems
to have been incorporated, and baron-bailies appointed from the
date of the charter; but there is no formal sett extant of older
date than 1757, ten years after hereditary jurisdictions were abo-
lished; a sett which, with a few modifications established by long
practice, forms the constitution under which the town is still go-
verned.
     According to these regulations, the powers invested by the char-
ter in the feudal lord are delegated after a manner specifically de-
fined, to his bailie, certain corporate bodies, and fifteen stent-mas-
ters.  There are seven corporate bodies, the Merchant Com-

repairing of the streets and other burghal expenses.  This tax
they impose on the inhabitants according to the rentals of their
properties, and the supposed value of their trades; but be-
fore levying it, the preliminary step must be gone through of
presenting an estimate of the probable expenditure for the ensu-
ing year to the bailie, whose approval and warrant are essential to
enable the stent-masters to collect the stent, and with whom also
it lies to judge of and determine all claims from exemption, as well
as all appeals against the amount of stent imposed.  These stent-
masters are fifteen in number, of whom eight are nominated by
the bailie; the remaining seven consist of the reses for the time
being of the Merchant Company and the deacons of the six crafts;
and they have power, in their collective capacity, to elect from their
own number a preses and treasurer, and also to choose their own
clerk and quarter-master.  The principal officer, however, under
