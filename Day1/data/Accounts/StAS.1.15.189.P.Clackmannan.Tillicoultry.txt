     of Tillicoultry.

     NUMBER. XII.

     PARISH OF TILLICOULTRY.

     (COUNTY OF CLACKMANNAN, PRESBYTERY OF DUMBLANE,
     SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLIAM OSBURN, Minister.

     Etymology of the Name.

   THE origin of the name is generally supposed to be Gae-
lic, and Tillicoultry compounded of the three words, Tullich,
cut and tir.  These words signify literally, the mount or hill
at the back of the country, and seem to refer to the Kirk-hill,
and the Cuninghar; a rising ground, which begins near the
house of Tillicoultry and the old kirk, and runs in a S. E.
direction till it reaches the Dovan.  This rising ground has
a strikingly romantic appearance, as one approaches it,
either from the East or the West.  And as it intersects a
beautiful plain, which begins at the Abbey-Craig near Stirling,
and extends to Vicar's Bridge, it has justly been distinguished
as the termination of the plain, or strath.  But the author of
this account hopes he will not be accused of affectation, if
he ventures to give a Latin derivation, and considers Tillicoul-
try as compounded either of Tellus culta or Tellus cultorum
