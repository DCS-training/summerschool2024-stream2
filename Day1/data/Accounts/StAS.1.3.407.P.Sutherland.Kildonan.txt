Helmsdale.  The number of lochs amount to 10, which
contain plenty of trout, and some salmon.

   Mountains.-There are six mountains, not very high, but
covered with heath.  Across one of these hills, called Slerfil,
there is a road, (the Crasg), which leads from Badfluich, at
the foot of Bein Uarigh, to Lothbeghouse, through a deep
valley, (Glenloth), about 5 miles in length, being a course
about half way shorter in distance, than round Helmsdale
to the coast.  Towards the north-west, in the height of the
parish, in the straight course to that of Farr, there is a place
called Bealach-nan Creach; and another leading to Strath-
haladale, in the parish of Reay, Bealach Chnoieshim, both
of which can only be travelled on horseback, with proper
guides.  It would be of vast utility, that the tract in the
Crasg was made a patent good road, and a road cut out
in Bealachsnan, Creach, and Cnockfin, where there is not so
much as the vestige of one for a number of miles.  The
hill road called Bealach-nan-Creach, on the west side of Bein
Mhadugh, signifies the Pass or Streight of Spoils, depredation,
or booty. During the establishment of the feudal system,
when the M.Kays were proprietors of Strathnaver, in the
parish of Farr, great numbers of cattle were carried away
from the Highlands of Sutherland, on this side of the coun-
ty, through this pass, from which it derived its name. Such
depredations were not considered as acts of spuilzie of theft.
but the effects of bravery and reprizals.  Near the foot of Bein
Ghrim-mor, and not far from the Bealach, ther is and ex-
tensive green field, (now used for a shielding), called Inis
Chombraig, or the Field of Contest; where there are many
small hillocks, covered with moss and heath; and also a 
larger cairn, called Carn-an-Teichigh, the Cairn of Retreat.
In this place, it is supposed, the people of Sutherland en-
