here, was peats from Galston muir, a few coals excepted, 
which were carried in sacks on horses backs, from Caprington,
near Kilmarnock, through almost impassible clay roads.  The
late Mr Wallace of Cessnock is the gentleman, to whom this
neighbourhood owes the important advantages both of coal and
lime, which have so materially contributed to its improvement.
There is no doubt, that all the muir edges abound in iron ore,
which might be smelted to great profit.  At Cairnsaigh, there
was lately discovered, on the banks of the Aven, a vein of
very rich iron ore; and several tons were wrought out by the
Muirkirk company.  But it was given up for want of proper
roads to convey it.-The Burn-Anne throws up at times
some good pebbles, which are supposed to come from the
sides of the Mol-mount-hill, where it is said they abound.-
There are many stone quarries in the parish; and, close to
the village, abundance of stone of a red colour, which is well
calculated for building.

   Population.-In 1755, the population of Galston amounted
to 1013 souls.
   It appears, from an actual and pretty accurate survey taken
in 1790, that the number had increased to 1577, of which
1219 were examinable.
   In the village of Galston, which, An.  1779, contained on-
ly 455 souls, there are at present 573, of which the follow-
ing is an analysis.
