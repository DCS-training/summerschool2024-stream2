     Statistical Account

and on the Sorn side, there are rich seams of excellent
cold; but as a fire-engine is necessary for drawing off hte
water, and none has yet been erected, this coal has hitherto
been, in a great measure, inaccessible.  In another extensive
field, on the Sorn estate, and at a very small distance from
the Castle, there are 2 seams of coal, each about a foot in
thickness, with a stratum of hard till, of about 2 feet thick,
running between them.  These seams, it is true, are rather
inconsiderable; but as they are only about 8 or 9 fathoms
deep, and not in the smallest degree incommoded by water,
they are wrought at very little expence.  Nine colliers
are at present employed at this work; and the out-put per
week is about 250 loads.  As this coal lies nearer to the
principal markets than any other in the parish, the proprie-
tor, taking advantage of this circumstance, has lately raised
the price form 6 d. to 8d. per load.  Seven years ago, the
price was only 4d.  In other parts of the sorn estate there
are rich mines of excellent lime-stone; and in other parts,
too, trials are at present making, for the purpose of finding
new seams of coal; trials which promise to be attended with
success.

   In a rising ground on the south side of the river there is
a lime-work of long standing, the property of Mr Farquhar
Gray of Gilmillcrost; and 2 collieries, one belonging to
him, and the other, contiguous to it, in the farm of Burn-
head, the property of Mr Logan of Logan.  The former of
these gentlemen has been pleased to favour me with a short
account of these works, which I shall take the liberty of
communicating nearly in his own words.

   "The average quantity of lime raised at this work, du-
ring the 18 years that I have been concerned in it, is
about 90000 bolls of shells, each consisting of 5 Winchester
bushels; but in some particular years we have sold 14,000
bolls.  This was actually the quantity sold last season;
