     of Whittingham.

     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF WHITTINGHAM.

     (COUNTY OF EAST LOTHIAN.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN EWAN.

     Situation, and Extent.

   The parish of Whittingham is situated in the presbytery
of Dunbar, and synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.  It
extends, from north to south, between 10 and 11 miles, and
from east to west, (where it is broadest,) about 4 .  It may 
be considered under two distinct heads, the Lamer-moor, or
upper, and the arable, or lower district.

   Lamer-moor.-The word, Lamer-moor, imports, it is said, the
moor which reaches to the sea*.-It deserves attention,
that, in the Roman province, which was situated between the
wall of Hadrian, and that of Severus, we meet with no other
moorish hills, that extend quite to the sea.  They begin at
Coldinghame, in the Merse, and Dunglass in East Lothian;
both which places stand close upon the sea, and run west-

*Moor sur la mer.  Others imagine, that it is the moor where
lambs were more abundant, than in any other part of Scotland.
