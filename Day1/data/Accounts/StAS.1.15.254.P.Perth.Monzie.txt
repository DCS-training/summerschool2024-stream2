of the river at the top is 18 feet, the height of the fall 55
feet, and the breadth at the bottom 43 feet.  It falls over
very rugged rocks.  One would think the path had been

   Artificial Mount, Large Trees, etc.-Opposite to the foot
of the principal entry into the mansion-house of Monzie,
there is an artificial mount, near 70 feet high, in shape
a truncated cone, upon which stands a a Chinese temple.
This temple is hexagonal, and almost entirely open, ex-

12 broad, and 14 feet high.  The roof terminates in a point,
upon which there is a balcony with a bell, about 4 feet high.
In the garden of Monzie there are 4 larch trees, said to be
the finest and largest in Britain.  They are not yet 60 years

mid-height is 7 feet, and its circumference at the ground 16
feet; its branches extend all around 30 feet on each side.
The other two are about the same height, but the circum-

other is only 9 feet; the fourth is 90 feet high, and 8 feet
in circumference at the ground.  They are all in perfect vi-
