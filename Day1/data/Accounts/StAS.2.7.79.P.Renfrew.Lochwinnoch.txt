culations from this guage, it would not have appeared that such
an immense quantity of rain falls in this neighbourhood: still it is
not to be denied that the quantity is great. It will immediately
appear that it is very much the same with that which falls at Largs,
where observations of this kind were long made by Sir Thomas
Brisbane, at Brisbane House. We are separated from that parish
by the high-land about Misty Law and Staik, which attract the
vapour rising out of the great Atlantic Ocean, and condense it into
rain, and send it down with impartial favour, upon us, and the inha-
bitants of Largs. Though a great quantity, however, falls in the
neighbourhood of our high bills; yet it appears from a statement
in Wilson's Account of Renfrewshire, that the whole west part of
Scotland is not deluged with so much rain. The following is his
report for 1809 and 1810, at the four following places:

<TABLE>

    Years.    Dalkeith.  Bothwell Castle. Glasgow.   Large.
    1809      28.552	 24.440	          25.132     38.624
    1810      25.636	 25.010	          21.433     38.714

  From this statement it will be seen that more rain falls at Dal-
keith than at either Glasgow or Bothwell Castle. Mr Wilson him-
self remarks, that, "although it thus appears that the quantity of
rain in the west of Renfrewshire is considerable, it is certainly far
short of that which falls annually at Lancaster, Manchester, Ken-
dal, and Keswick, which is 40.3, 43.1, 61.2, 70.6 inches respective-
ly. The quantity of rain is not so much to be dreaded as its fre-
quency."
  The direction in which the wind blows morning and evening at
eight o'clock, and the state of the weather, morning, noon, and even-
ing, as cloudy, wet, or fair, are noted in the journal from which
I have already quoted. This last record impressed me more than
ever with the idea of the lowering aspect of our sky. There is a
succession of cloudy, hazy, showery, and wet, but comparatively
little sunshine and fair weather. In 1827, the wind was westerly
seven months, southerly three, and northerly two.  And there fell
46.86 inches of rain, so that the westerly wind does not bring such
a quantity of rain as it produces frequent showers. Little comes
from the north, and an east rain usually continues two or three days.
  In 1828 the wind was southerly six months, westerly four, north-
east one, and east one, and there fell 54.94 inches of rain, so that
the prevailing south wind produced more rain than the prevailing
west wind of the former year.
  In 1829, the wind was northerly four months, westerly four,
southerly 2, and north-west two, and there fell 39.85 inches of
