and there are also several indigent persons, who receive week-
ly pensions from the same quarter.

   About the year 1750, the inhabitants, in order to put a
stop to begging, and to give more regular relief to the modest
poor, assessed themselves in the payment of annual poors rates,
the amount of which was then about L. 100.  With this,
and the other funds, all the poor, (then upwards of 50,)
were decently supported, and begging, for a time, strictly

and to individuals, is such societies were more universal.  To be
