stage of society, the female sex might well be employed in
the art of weaving: The labour is not hard, and they suffer

   Population.-Of the ancient late of population in this pa-
rish, no satisfactory account can be given i only that from the
first notice we have of the country, it seems, in general, to
have been well peopled.  Early in the 5th century, we find
the Atacotti (of whose territory Kintyre made a considerable
part)mentioned as making no inconsiderable figure in the
Roman armies into which great numbers of them probably

this place (Dalruadhain) sent for, to decide the contest about
the right of succession to the throne of Ireland; and in the
12th century, Somerled of Kintyre was, at one time, possessed

a party of Irish to assist Montrose.  The Earl of Antrim was
