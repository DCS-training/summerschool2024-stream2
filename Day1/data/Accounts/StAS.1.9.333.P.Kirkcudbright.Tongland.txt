move a tax, which is now become truly oppressive in this
part of the country.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In the lands of Kirkconnel
there is a fine natural wood, in a very thriving condition.
Some of the residing heritors have planted a great number
of trees of different kinds of late years.  On the top of a
hill called Knockmuir, a little to the north of the kirk,
there is a most beautiful landscape, and most extensive pro-
spect.  It is esteemed the most beautiful in the south of
Scotland.  In a clear and serene day, many persons of taste,
and lovers of nature, flock to this spot, to delight them-
selves with the varied beauties of the scene.  Little snow
lies here, but quickly melts, from the natural warmth of
the soil.-We have all the natural wild animals that are com-
mon to this corner of the country.  All the migratory birds
appear here very early in their seasons, and some of them
continue longer than in some other parts of the county.-
There have been no remarkable instances of longevity of
late years; but there are a number of persons who are a-
bove 80 or 90 years of age.  Very few persons have emi-
grated to America.  There are no villages.  The cotton
manufacture is not as yet introduced here.  The cross-
roads in the parish are in pretty good repair.
