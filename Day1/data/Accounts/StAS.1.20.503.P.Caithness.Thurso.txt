   "In December 1796, the conssuent small-pox became
highly epidemic and fatal in this county; in Thurso more
particularly, the epidemic was almost general, and, by my
calculation, one in four fell a victim."
   "Both in this town, and in the county, the mortality be-

as a practitioner in the place:  in this I had to encounter
