plan, however justifiable in itself, and on the part of the
proprietors, was unpopular, because it occasioned the remo-
val of the native possessors of these farms and grazings, and 
excited a disorderly and tumultuous spirit among the coun-
try-people, which it became necessary by legal and for-
cible means to suppress. This gave rise and rapid circula-
tion to a report, as injurious as it was groundless, that the
proprietors treated these poor tenants with oppression and
cruelty. In justice, however, to the proprietors of this pa-
rish, who have let any part of their estates for sheep-farm-
ing, it is proper to assure the public, that such tenants as
had been removed from their possessions for that purpose,
were otherwise provided in farms by these gentlemen, ei-
ther on their own estates, or on some others in their vici-
nity; and that to this humane object they paid every at-
tention in their power, feeling themselves particularly inte-
rested in, and solicitous for, the accommodation of the few
tenants whom, with a view to encourage the introduction
of sheep-farming, they had found it necessary to remove.

   Heritors of the Parish - The proprietors of the parish
are General Sir Hector Munro of Novar, K. B. Captain
Duncan Munro of Culcairn, Captain Hugh Munro of Tea-
ninich, Miss Mackenzie of Inchcoulta, and Andrew Munro
of Lealdie. Of these, General Hector Munro and 
Captain Hugh Munro of Teaninich have their family-seats,
and are resident in the parish.
   The place and family-seat of Novar has been highly cul-
tivated and improved by Sir Hector Munro, at a very
great expence, and with much and approved taste. It is
indeed a great and finished place, the most complete in
the north, and the admiration of all travellers to this coun-
try. It is, too, very advantageously situated, considerably
elevated above the frith, not a mile distant from it, and
                                              commanding
