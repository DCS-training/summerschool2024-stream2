in life.  Inoculation for the small-pox is now a good deal
practised, and is almost always successful in preventing the
fatal effects of that disease.  There are no instances of extra-
ordinary longevity in the parish at present, yet there are many
persons living and vigorous, who are above 70, and some above
80.  There is only one person above 90.  It may be here
mentioned, that the lady of a considerable proprietor in the
parish died not long ago, who saw in her own house eighty-
four returns of Christmas.  The mansion-house is close ad-
joining to several lakes.

washes the northern part of this parish, is the most consider-
able of our rivers.  It has been frequently mentioned in former
reports.  As its banks are low in this parish, it often suddenly
overflows them, and occasions considerable loss and disappoint-
ment to the husbandman.  This was remarkably the case in
harvest 1789.-The next in size is the Ericht, which, from
its rapidity, has acquired the appellation of the Ireful Ericht.
It is formed by the junction of the Ardle and the Black-
Water.  It runs along the east side of the parish for about
9 miles.  Its channel in general is very rocky and uneven,
and it often varies in its depth and breadth.  The banks in
many places are so low, that it frequently overflows them,
and does considerable damage, especially in harvest.  In other
parts they rise to a great height, are very rugged, and often
covered with wood.  About two miles north from the village
of Blair-Gowrie, they rise at least 200 feet above the bed of
the river; and on the west side are formed, for about 700
feet in length, and 220 feet in height, of perpendicular rock,
as smooth as if formed by the tool of the workman.  The
place where this phenomenon is to be seen is called Craig-
lioch, where the traveller may be furnished with one of the
