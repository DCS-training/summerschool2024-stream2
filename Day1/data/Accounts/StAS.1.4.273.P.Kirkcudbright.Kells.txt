four fairs in the year.  Here is an excellent meal-market;
for as meal and barley are almost always 2 d. and mostly 3 d.
the stone cheaper here than at Dalmelleton and shire of Ayr,
great quantities are purchased at New Galloway, and car-
ried thither, where they meet with a ready market.-The
Park of Glenlee, where there is a house elegantly sitted up
by the late Lord President, Sir Thomas Miller, is one
of the finest situations in this hilly country.  It is on
the banks of the river Ken, at the head of a beautiful
holm, surrounded with hills, finely skirted with natural wood,
and sheltered with clumps of fir, and fine old oak.  Two
beautiful cascades, or falls of water, are near it.-There is
still to be seen the vestige of a road from the King's Holm
to the castle of Dinduck, 3 miles distant.  But who this
king was, tradition itself does not say.  This old castle or
abbey, or whatever it was, is now ruins, and has all the
marks of having been a strong place.  Some arched cel-
lars, and some pieces of the mouldered walls, are all that re-
main of a large building.
