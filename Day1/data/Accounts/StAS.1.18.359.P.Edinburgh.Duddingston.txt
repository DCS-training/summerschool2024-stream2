Edinburgh is little more than a mile; and the path that leads
to it through the steep acclivities and chasms of the hill,
though formerly difficult to pass, has yet proved suffciently
alluring to induce many of its opulent citizens to resort
thither, in the summer months, to solace themselves over one
of the ancient homely dishes of Scotland*, for which the

and north by those of St. Cuthbert's, Canongate, and South
Leith, and upon the east by the Frith of Forth.

house.  The oldest records of the session are only of the
year 1631.  In 1630 the lands of Prestonfield were disjoined
from the kirk and parish of St. Cuthbert's, of which they had

and leaving the head, etc.  to be consumed in the place.
