12 feet high.  This quantity is not sufficient for an ordinary
farmer one year; it costs L. 1, 10 s. for cutting it out and dry-
ing it in the moss, and when brought to this palce, it is worth
about L. 5 Sterling.  The farmers bring home their peats
with their own horses, in the end of summer; but it is a la-
borious and expensive work, and detains them long from the
improvement of the land.  English coals are sold here at
5 s. the boll of 36 stone; Scotch coals at 4 s. 6 d.  The high
duty upon coals, which are brought to the north country, is
justly complained of, as as improper and partial tax.  Were
that article furnished at a moderate expence, it would be
one of the most important advantages which thid country
could receive.  In this case, the more judicious farmers would
shew an example of the use of coals to others, and devote
their time more closely to the cultivation of the soil.  But
whatever improvements are or may be proposed here, either
with respect to agriculture or manufactures, the dearth of
fuel,  is, and must continue to be an obstacle, which, without
the aid of the Legislature, can never be removed.
