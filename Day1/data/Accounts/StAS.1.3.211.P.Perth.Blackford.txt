year.  At the Rebellion 1715, it was garrisoned by a
party of Mar's army, and taken by Argyle.  Before the 1745,
Lord George Murray and his family resided in it.  Since
that time it has been suffered to go to ruin.

   Miscellaneous Observations-There are no mountains in
this parish, except a small ridge of the Ochils.  It is not so
high as the ridge to the south of it, which is seen from
Edinburgh.  It is covered for the most part with fine pas-
ture.

   We have frequent thunder and lightening in this pa-
rish, but no remarkable accident has ever happened by it-
We are exposed to very violent gales of wind from the west
and southwest, which sometimes unroof houses, blow down
trees, and in harvest cause a prodigious shaking in the stand-
ing corns.  About two years ago, a hurricane of this kind
began about the west end of the parish, and continued in a 
direction north east, for about a dozen of miles, and little
more than three miles in breadth.  the greatest part of the 
flax was at the time spread upon the ground, and, within the
limits mentioned, it swept the whole before it, rolled it into
heaps behind dykes or hedges, or threw it into ditches and
other hollow places.

   The parish of Blackford hath no peculiar advantages or
disadvantages.  The names of places in it are for the most
part English, but some few are evidently Gaelic.

     The people have nothing remarkable in their size,
strenght, or feature; they are of the middle size, of a dusky
complexion, have a serious turn, and are very zealous in 
religious matters.
