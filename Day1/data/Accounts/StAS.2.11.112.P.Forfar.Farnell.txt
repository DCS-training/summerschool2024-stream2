   Husbandry.--Husbandry is in a highly advanced state; and much
especially has been done in the way of draining. The leases are
in all ordinary cases for nineteen years, and are considered favour-

closures are in general excellent; and every encouragement seems
to be given to the industry and spirit for improvement which exists
amongst the farmers. The ordinary kinds of farm stock are rear-
ed with great success; and of the prizes given for such by the For-
farshire Agricultural Association, the produce of this parish has for
many years carried off a distinguished share.
