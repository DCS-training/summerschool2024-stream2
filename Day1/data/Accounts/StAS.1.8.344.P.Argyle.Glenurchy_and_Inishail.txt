     Statistical Account

to Lochow, it receives a considerable body of water at each
extremity, and discharges itself laterally, into an arm of the
sea at Runaw, after a turbulent series of cataracts for 3 miles.
After a winding course of 14 miles, the river Urchay falls in-
to Lochow, at the east end, about a mile below the parish
church.  The lake and river abound with salmon, char, trout
and eels.  The last is the abhorence of almost all the com-
mon people in the highlands, who consider them as water ser-
pents, and unfit for the use of man.  Four miles below the
church, at a place called Catnish, shoals of salmon are taken
in the Urchay, by a simple but fatal device.  A bold project-
ing rock crosses the bed of the river, nearly from side to side.
Its height is such, that few fish can overleap the torrent;
which, after rains, rushes forcibly into the pool below.  Many
salmon, in attempting to leap fall into a creel, or basket, fixed
transversely within the stream.  But the great slaughter is
effected in a more fraudulent manner.  On the one side of
the river there is an open, of the wideness of a mill-race, be-
twixt the rock and the bank.  Here a wicker gate is fixed,
that can be opened and shut at pleasure.  Many yards above
this entry, the stream is secured by a like barrier.  When
the water is high and turbid, the fish are let in below, and
when the fisherman is satisfied with the numbers that have
passed into his toils, he shuts the door of his prison; and,
like a merciless executioner, he drags his prey with his spear,
one after another on shore.  Scores, at times, are thus de-
stroyed in the course of a few hours.  There are several other
lakes and rivers, of lesser note, in the parish:  all of them
abounding with fine trout.
