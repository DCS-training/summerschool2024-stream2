thirty years, and has had them from all the different corners
of Scotland, says, that he knows no place so well adapted
for mehorating wool, as the Island of May; he adds, that
the fleeces of the coarsest woolled sheep, that ever came
from the worst pasture in Scotland, when put on the Island
of May, in the course of one season, become as fine as
fattin; their flesh also has a superior flavour; and that rab-
bits bred on this island have a finer fur than those which are
reared on the main-land.

   While employed in drawing up this account, a very me-
lancholy accident happened, which ought to be recorded, as
a warning to future times.  The keeper of the light house,
his wife, and five children, were suffocated.  One child, an
infant, is still alive, who was found sucking at the breast of
its dead mother.  Two men, who were assistants to the 
keeper, were fenfelefs, but got out alive.  This truly
mournful event was owing to the cinders having been allow-
ed to accumulate, for more than ten years.  The cinders
reached up to the windows of the apartment where these un-
fortunate people slept.  They were set on fire by live coals
falling from the light-house, and the wind blowing the
smoke into the windows, and the door below being shut, the
consequences were inevitable.  These persons were the only
inhabitants, and all of them lodged in the light-house.  The
families, who formerly resided there, lodged in houses detached
from it.  The old plan is to be again adopted; and houses
are preparing for lodging the keeper, and a boat's crew,
which will be of advantage to all the coast, as they will be
ready to give intelligence when the herrings come into
the Frith.  The revenue arising from the light-house, was
formerly let at L. 360 per annum; it was let last year at
L. 970.
