   Mention separately the expence of the different locks, and
the places where these would be needed; and in general give
separate statements of every extraordinary expence, such as

twixt wright work and mason work, etc.

of a constant supply of water for the canal in all its parts.

nal would run.
   Should the undertaking exceed at the utmost 30,000 L. it
will be given up as being more costly than beneficial.  There-
fore, if after inspecting the grounds, and ascertaining the le-
vels, any of the above mentioned directions appear impracti-
cable, or even very expensive, you are desired to report your
opinion; and the information you may collect concerning
these lines, or any parts thereof before proceeding further, in
a more particular survey.
   In general, report every particular coming within your ob-
servation necessary to be known by the directors of the pre-
sent undertaking, as in any degree connected therewith.
   The private opinions or suggestions of no individuaI are to
be attended to in making this survey; and you are always to
adopt that line which to the best of your judgment is most
calculated for public utility.
   Drawings of the canal in its different courses, and some
of the principal works attending it, must be engraved.
