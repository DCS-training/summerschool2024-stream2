     Statistical Account

of the Laird of M'Leod, of which he has retained the superi-
ty, and a handsome annual feu-duty.
   The division of the parish belonging to Lord M'Donald,
rents at above L. 800.  That belonging to M'Leod of Rasay,
at about L. 120; and that district, the property of the above
mentioned feuers, rented when purchased by them for about
L. 200 ster. but would now undoubtedly bring them as
much more, were they to let their respective properties.

   Schools, Church, etc.-There are no public schools in this
district.  The places of worship are four, at a considerable
distance from each other.  The vestiges of a parish kirk only
remain; an estimate of one has been taken last year, with a
view of building early this season, but no farther steps
have hitherto been taken.  There is no manse, the pre-
sent incumbent, Mr Malcolm M'Leod, lives on a small farm
which he rents from Lord M'Donald; he became mi-
nister of Snizort in the year 1788.  His predecessors in the
parish were Messrs Archibald, Donald, Archibald, and Wil-
liam M'Queens, all in lineal descent, the son uniformly suc-
ceeding the father for four generations.  The present minister
is married, and has four sons and three daughters.
   The value of the living, including the glebe, is about L. 75
ster.  The patronage is claimed by the crown and the Laird of
M'Leod, but both concurring in the settlement of the present
incumbent, who had a regular presentation from each, the
question of right was left to be discussed before the court
competent, at some future period.
   The name of the parish, as well as the names of most places
in it, are Danish; some indeed are of Celtic origin; and in
some instances, the places take their names from their local
situation.
