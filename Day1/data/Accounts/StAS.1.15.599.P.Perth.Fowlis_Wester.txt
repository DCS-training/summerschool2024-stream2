equally the ideas of richness and beauty.  The imagination
is exceedingly delighted with the approach devised by the
present proprietors, while, after passing for 500 yards through
a large plantation, along the side of a deep den, in which a
considerable stream occasionally appears, through the over-
shadowing trees and shrubs, with which its steep banks are
plentifully stored, and then retiring obliquely 300 yards far-
ther under a shady grove, it presents in succession to the
view, the wide sloping lawns, the venerable oaks, the pleasing
cascades, and fanciful lakes, which adorn and diversify the
scene.
   Near two miles to the North-West of this ancient mansion,
is the house of Cultoquhey, the seat of the only other resid-
ing heritor, which, with the delightful adjoining wood, struck
the eye of every traveller with peculiar pleasure, while the
public road lay about 800 yards distant to the South.  But
since the high way has been conducted by the North side of
the house, these beautiful objects appear with less advantage.
   Besides these two, the house of Gorthy is the only one in
the parish, in which an heritor has at least occasionally resid-
ed; that, however, is now desolate, the estate having lately
gone by purchase into another family.

   Antiquities.-About a mile East of the church, on the farm
of Castleton, part of the estate of Foulis, and on the East side
of a den or ravine, which divides that from the estate of A-
bercarney, appear the remains of a fort or castle, the seat of
the ancient Earl of Strathearn.  The ruins now form a gras-
ly mount, constantly employed as a pasture field.  Here re-
sided Mallus, Malisius, or Malise, the first Earl of Strathearn,
who lived in the reign of Alexander I.  His grandson Gil-
bert, in the year 1200, founded the monastery of Inchaffray,
whose ruins ly contiguous to the South border of this parish.
