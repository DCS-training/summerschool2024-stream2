     Statistical Account

   The prosperity and happiness of every individual must, in
general, depend on his virtue, as must that of the nation,
which is composed of these individuals.  A corrupted em-
pire must therefore tend fast to ruin, witness the example of 
France, where all religion had long been a farce, and morals
of consequence depraved.
   Hence arises the necessity of watching over the manners,
as well as the morals of the people, and particularly of the
higher ranks, whose example is often pernicious.
   But let us see, in a society  comparatively small to many o-
thers, the effect of the increase of wealth upon manners, whe-
ther as tending to improvement, or otherwise.  Many chan-
ges, however, may be totally unconnected with this cause.

   In 1763-People of fashion dined at two o'clock, or a little
after it;-business was attended to in the afternoon.  It was a 
common practice to lock the shops at one o'clock, and to open
them after dinner at two.
   In 1783-People of fashion, and of the middle rank, dined
at four or five o'clock:  No business was done in the after-
noon, dinner of itself having become a very serious business.
   In 1763-Wine was seldom seen, or, in a small quantity, at
the tables of the middle rank of people.
   In 1791-Every trademan in decent circumstances presents
wine after dinner; and many in plenty and variety*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*In 1708-The year of the Union, 288,336 barrels of two-penny ale paid
duty.
In 1720-520, 478 1/2 barrels paid duty.
In 1784-97, 577 1/2 barrels paid duty.
This is a striking proof of the decrease of malt liquor, and of the consequent
increase of the use of wine, and spirituous liquors.
Compare this with the note page 594.
