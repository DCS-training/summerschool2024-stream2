cent sent of General Sir John H. Dalrymple, on the west bank of
the Tyne, the grounds around which are very picturesque; Pres-
tonhall, the splendid mansion of William Burn Callender, Esq.;
on the opposite bank Chesterhall House, rather an old building,
also belonging to Sir John h. Dalrymple, Bart.  An elegant Go-
thic church, of freestone, was erected in 1825; and a very elegant
manse, of freestone, in the manor style, was built in 1830.

                       III.-POPULATION.
  According to Dr Webster's report, the population amounted to
725; in 1792, it was 839; in 1831, 1030.  The increase is partly
owing to the improved state of agriculture, the farmers being ob-
liged to employ a greater number of hands, and partly to an ad-
ditional number of colliers being required.  The number of the
population residing in villages is about 417, the rest reside in the
country.  The average number of recorded baptisms for the last
seven years is 18, of marriages 7.  There is no record kept of the
deaths.

   Character ofthe People.-The people in general are cleanly,
industrious in their habits, and content with their circumstances;
they enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of
society; are commonly well-behaved, and  pay attention to the
public ordinances of religion.  The principal part of their food
consists of oatmeal and potatoes.  Poacbing in game does not
prevail to any great extent so far as known to me.

                         IV.-INDUSTRY.

the open field.  He, along with Mr Cockburn of Ormiston, esta-
blished a society for the improvement of agriculture.  All the pa-
