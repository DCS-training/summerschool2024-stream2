   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages of this
parish are, fire, water, and fine women; notwithstanding
which, most of the heritors reside at a distance, and leave
their tenants to the mercy of factors, and under agents, who,
besides the services payable to their masters, require many
others, under the denomination of Favours, which, like
Harry VIII.'s Benevolences, they dare not refuse.  But it
is to be hoped, that Mr Honyman of Graemfay, whose
mind is enlightened by southern ideas, will redress those
grievances, will abolish personal services, will grant long
leases to his tenants, and encourage them to improve their
farms; whereby he will render his people happy, his fami-
ly respected, and gain to himself immortal honour; whilst
his conduct, at the same time, will be an example to other
which they will be proud to imitate.
