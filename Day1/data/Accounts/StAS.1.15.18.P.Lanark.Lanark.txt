feet, in reducing rough land.  They likewise use two
light harrows for grass seeds.  Mr Honyman employs
two oxen and two horses in breaking up his moor
grounds; but no oxen are used any where else in the pa-
rish, excepting at Bonniton, although the saving of oats
ought greatly to encourage them in a parish where oat-
meal gives so high a price.
   Lime is in pretty general use as a manure*; where it
has not been too frequently applied, it produces fine
crops; but where the land has been often limed, it is
found to succeed best when made up into compost dung-
hills, and when led out in harvest and laid upon lea
grounds, it is attended with grout advantage.  There is
some very good marle in the estate of Bonniton, but at
present it is not dug out for sale.
   There is very little wheat sown in the parish, either
owing to the want of a flour mill, the scarcity of inclo-
sure, or the high situation of the district.  Some years
ago, several acres were annually sown with slax, which
yielded from 24 to 40 stones per acre; but the trouble at-
tending the different operations, and the distance from wa-
tering places, prevent it from being sown in quan-
tities; so that the general crops in use are barley,
oats, potatoes, pease, and rye grass and clover.
   Turnips, though a most profitable crop, are by no means
in common use.  When the old crofts are laid out in pas-
ture for milk cows, great quantities ot butter and cheese
are made; and the produce of each cow, under proper
management, yields from 4 L. to 6 L. sterling annually.
   Oats and pease are sown from the first of March
to the middle of April, potatoes from the middle of A-
