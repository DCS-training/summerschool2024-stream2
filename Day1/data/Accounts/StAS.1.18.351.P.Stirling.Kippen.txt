Murrayshall, about 12 miles from the village.  This lime-
stone being of a richer quality than that which is nearer us,
is found peculiarly suitable for the dryfield.  The shells cost
8 s. 6 d. or 9 s. per chalder at the kiln.
   The parish of Kippen raises much more grain than is neces-
sary for its own consumpt, but lies far from a good market.
Stirling is abundantly supplied from its own immediate vicini-
ty, and both Glasgow and Dunbarton are 24 miles from the
village.  This disadvantage might be alleviated by making
good roads.  The road from Kippen to Glasgow by Campsie
moor, was formerly extremely bad, and often impassable in
winter.  In 1792 it was made turnpike, and the course of it
in several places altered with advantage.  A bill has lately
received the sanction of parliament for making the military
road turnpike likewise.  As these two great roads intersect
each other at the village of Kippen, the effects of this under-
taking must be extremely favourable to this neighbourhood,
as well as convenient for the public in general, by opening
the communication between the northern and southern parts
of the country.
   It is the opinion of many of the graziers and dealers in cat-
tle, that Kippen is one of the most convenient places, per-
haps, in Scotland for a cattle market; and that in the late
fluctuating state of the trysts, it might not have been difficult
to transfer to it a great part of the spring and autumn markets.
There is a spacious moor near the village which lies very
convenient for that purpose.  With a view to encourage
their resort to it, Mr Graham of Gartmore, the pro-
prietor, offered it to the dealers in cattle free of custom for
19 years.
   It is also believed that the establishment of a corn mar-
ket once a week at Kippen might prove very benefi-
cial; as also a weekly market in the time of harvest for
