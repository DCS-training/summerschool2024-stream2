   Trade.-There is no particular branch of trade in the pa-
rish, except what arises from the coal and salt works, carried
on to a considerable extent on the property of Sir John Hen-
derson.  The various branches of these works afford main-
tenance to several hundred people of one description or o-
ther.  The greatest part of the coal and salt is exported from
St Davids, a spacious harbour situated at the Western ex-
tremity of the parish in Inverkeithing bay, where vessels of a-
ny burthen, not exceeding 500 or 600 tons, can load in safety.
The distance from the pits to the shore is near 4 miles, a-
long which the coals are carried in waggons that contain 48
cwt.  It is well ascertained, that this coal has been known
and wrought for upwards of 200 years, and a considerable
field of it still remains. The surrounding district, lying in
the parishes of Dunfermline and Aberdour, contains also ma-
ny seams of coal of an excellent quality, sufficient it is thought,
to supply the usual demand for centuries to come.
