nion is much in favour of turnpikes.  One of the most ex-
tensive bleachfields in Scotland is carried on at Trailslat.
There are only 3 small villages.  There is one lake of about
5 or 6 acres in extent.  It is said that a set of farm houses
once stood on the spot which this lake now occupies, and that
they were sunk by an eartquake.  Almost every farmers has
two carts.  Two horses will draw, in light single carts, 16
creels of coal from Sanquhar with greater ease than 10 creels
in a heavy double cart.  In 1782, the parish not only sup-
plied itself, but exported grain in considerable quantities.
Property in land has been frequently changing; but some
farms have been rented by the same family for the space of
300 years.  About nine yars ago the parish abounded with
wood; but only a few trees now remain.  The woods on
one estate sold for L. 6000.  The people, with a few excep-
tions, are inductious and sober.  They enjoy many of the
comforts of society:  Their houses, however, are in general
miserable hovels.  Till within these two or three years, up-
wards of 500 bushels of malt were made in the parish by
different tenants for their own use, and to supply labourers
at a reasonable rate, the excise of which, though moderate,
amounted to a considerable sum; but they are now almost
totally deprived of this comfort, owing chiefly to the severity
of the excise laws, and are in danger of being driven to the
dram-sbop, which is at once pernicious to their health and de-
structive of their morals.
