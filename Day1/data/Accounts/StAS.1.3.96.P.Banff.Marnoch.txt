whole farms are mostly inclosed; but the rest of the coun-
try, in general, is not.

   Poor.-There are seven upon the poor's roll.  The sum
of L. 40 Sterling is yearly expended for their relief, which
arises from the collections of the church, penalties, a small
payment for the more-cloth, and hand-bell, at burials, with
the annualrent of L. 100 settled for their relief.

six guineas a-year, other men servants about L. 5 Sterling.
A woman servant from L. 2 to L. 3 a-year.

   Eminent Men.-Marnoch has produced no man eminent
in learning of science, except Alexander Gordon, Esq; late

Great, and by his personal valour and good conduct in the
war carried on against Charles XII. King of Sweden, was
raised to the rank of Major-General, and wrote his history.

even tried for a capital crime.
