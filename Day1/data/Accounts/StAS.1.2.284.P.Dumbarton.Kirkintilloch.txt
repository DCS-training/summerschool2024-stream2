joy the consequence, which landed property confers, and to
the pleasures which imagination fondly, but too often fallaci-
ously, ascribes to a life spent in rural employments:  Whilst a-
gain, the profits of spinning, and the manufacturing spirit of
the country, have commonly induced the farmer to pay only
a partial attention to the cares of husbandry.

     Corruption of Morals likely to attend the increase of Industry.
   One unhappy circumstance, that may attend the increase
of industry, and the introduction of new manufactures among
us, is too important to be overlooked:  Children becoming
sooner able to subsist by the profits of their own labour, will,
of consequence, sooner disregard the authority of their parents,
acquire earlier habits of expence; and, being exposed to the
infection of vice and dissipation, before the powers of their
minds are in any degree matured, or their characters formed,
-will be much more worthless in manhood, and more help-
less in old age.  It would be a happy circumstance, therefore,
if politicians could contrive some means, to preserve the virtue
and morals of the people, while they are endeavouring to in-
crease their numbers, to enliven their industry, and to aug-
ment their wealth*.

*The advantages resulting from our late improvements is at-
tended with one circumstance, of which, we have reason to com-
plain, which is this, that the use of lime upon our lands, the filth,
which is conveyed into our rivers, from the coal-works in the neigh-
bourhood, and the machinery which have been erected, have alrea-
dy rendered a salmon fishery, which was considerable, very insig-
nificant; and, indeed, there is too much reason to apprehend, that
the fish in our rivers will be almost totally exterminated by the joint
-effects of these different sources of destruction.
