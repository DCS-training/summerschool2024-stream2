I.-ToPOGRAPI-TY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.-T]aE name of this parish is spelt in several different
ways; but appears to have been the same in pronunciation from
time immemorial. The first part of the word seems to be derived
from the Celtic word Mon or Monath, a hill; while the latter part
may be either mile, a mile; or meal, honey; or mcille, a mill.
Extent, Boundaries.- The parish forms an irregular oval, of which
the extreme length is 6 miles, and the extreme breadth 5; and con-

on the north and east by the parishes of Abdie, Dunbog, Moonzie,
and Cupar; and on the south and west by Cults and Collessie.
The northern part of the parish consists of a range of whinstone
hills, of which the Mount Hill is the highest. The southern part
is -more level, being a portion of the hollow which occupies the
centre of Fifeshire.
Meteorology, The general temperature of the atmosphere,

Generally speaking the climate is mild. The hills to the north
and east break the force of the wind from these quarters, while the
