     PARISH OF ROW,

     (COUNTY OF DUMBARTON.)

     By the Rev. JOHN ALLAN.

     Name, Situation, Soil, Fish, etc.

   THE name Row is a Gaelic word, and signifies 'a
'point.  Very near the place where the church is
situated, there is a pretty long point running out into the
sea.-The parish is situated in the presbytery of Dumbar-
ton, and Synod of Glasgow and Air.  It is between 13
and 14 miles in length, and about 3 in breadth; bounded
on the E. by the parish of Cardross; on the N. E. by Lufs;
on the N. W. by Lochlong; on the W. and S. by the Gare-
loch, which separates it from Roseneath, and the frith of
Clyde, which separates it from Greenock.  The E. end of
the parish is pretty flat, the greatest part of it hilly, and to-
wards the N. E. mountainous.  The soil in general is ligth,
and where it is properly cultivated pretty fertile.  The
air is sharp and healthy.  Fevers are the prevalent distem-
pers.  The sea-coast extends about 12 miles, for most part
flat and sandy, but in some places high and rocky.-Sal-
mon, haddocks, small cod, whitings, small flounders, and
sometimes mackered and herring, are caught in the lochs
