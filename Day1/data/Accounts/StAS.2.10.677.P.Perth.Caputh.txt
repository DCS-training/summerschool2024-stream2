         There are several villages in the parish, containing from 10 to
     to families.  The largest is Spittalfield, upwards of a mile east-
     ward of the church, in which is the parish school.   It is entirely

        The principal, and almost sole permanently resident heritor, is
     Sir John M. Mackenzie of Delvine; of the others, a few reside only
     during the summer months ; and the rest are scarcely ever seen
     on their properties, or care to be kept in remembrance by any
     good deed done in the parish.
        Language.-The Stormont dialect, of course, prevails, in which
     the chief peculiarity that strikes a stranger is the pronunciation
     of the Scotch oo as ee, poor being pronounced peer, moon meen,

     to every man who takes it into his head to sell whisky, and rob

     dissipation and immorality must spread and prevail among the lower
     classes, and the country become the haunts of vice as much as the
