     NUMBER XXI.

     PARISH OF MORVEN.

     (Presbytery of Mull.-Synod and County of Argyle.)

     By the Reverend Mr NORMAN M'LEOD.

     Extent, Name, etc.

   THE parish of Morven is bounded by the Sound of Mull
from S. E. to N. W. dividing it from the large island
of that name to the westward; on the N. by that arm of the
sea called Loch-Suineart, dividing it from the parish of Ard-
namurchan.  It has been computed to be 14 miles in length,
along the Sound of Mull; but the whole length of the parish,
taken from Tearneat on the E. to Aulistein on the W. can-
not be less than 20 miles.  Its greatest breadth is 10 com-
puted miles.  It forms a large peninsula, of which the
Isthmus, from Strontian at the head of Loch-Suineart to the
west shore of Linnehellih, in a straight line from sea to sea,
is about 6 miles over.-As this parish was never wholly sur-
veyed, it is difficult to form a conjecture what number of
acres it may contain; but, from a partial survey and mensura-
tion made, it cannot be much below 60,000.  The modern
name Morven, or Morvern, as it is more properly called, be-
ing the method of spelling it in ancient records, and much
nearer the uniform pronunciation of the inhabitants, is plain-
