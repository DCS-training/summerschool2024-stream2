   Of this last census, 385 were males, and 444 were females, and
the number of families was 165.*
   The disproportion of males and females in the preceding cen-
sus is not only reversed, but is greater than accords with any ratio
of differences,--a circumstance which is to be accounted for by the
employment of mnre females than males in the spinning-mills, and
at the loom at home, while the young men, chiefly from the Muir-
side, are more extensively known as excellent farm-servants in the
neighbouring parishes. Of 125 looms, which are at work in the
parish, 78 are occupied by female weavers, and 47 by males; and
of the whole number of looms in the parish, 90 are in the Muir-
side of Kinnell among 80 families. Thirty years ago, there were
only three or four female weavers in the parish; and their num-
ber did not greatly increase till 1821, when the withdrawal of a
great part of the Muirside lands, along with other circumstances,
taught them to seek a readier and more convenient employment
at the loom than in the distant fields of the farmers.  The de-
scription of linen cloth which the weavers weave here at present
is chiefly Osnaburg and sheeting; and it must also be remarked,
that eight or ten looms at present unoccupied in the Muirside be-
long to men who find a more congenial work in the construction,
of a railroad between Arbroath and Forfar.
   There is no residence in the parish for any of the proprietors
of the four estates; but, as almost all the estate of East Braky is
at present not under lease, the proprietors of that estate avail
themselves of tbe circumstance, by residing in the parish during
the summer months.
   No f`milies reside within the parish but such as are connected
with its agriculturing or manufacturing operations.
   Two men, now elderly, are more or less fatuous. In one fa-
mily, there are two children deaf and dumb. If the kirk-ses-
sion should send them to Edinburgh for education, they can ex-

<FOOTNOTE>The Parliamentary census of 1841 gave a population of 853. But in that num-
ber were included 23 strangers, who then lodged in the parish for the conveniency
of working at the new turnipike road between Pitmuir Mill tolls and Brechin.
