Woods, Plantations, &c.-There are several plantations in the
parish of considerable extent; Easter Elchies, Corgyle, and Ar-
ehiestown, are the chief. The wood of Dalballie was all cut down
a few years ago. In the year 1830, Mr M'Pherson Grant plant-
ed about 430 acres of hill pasture on the estate of Kirdals with
larches and Scotch firs, and in 1834 be commenced a similar plan-
tation of nearly the same extent.
   Trees.-In the garden of Knockando House are three old ash
trees, measuring severally in circumference II feet 3 inches, 9 feet
5 inches, and 7 feet 5 inches. During the spring of 1834, a larch
tree, 73 feet in length, which stood in the wood of Knockando,
was blown down by the force of the wind in a tremendous hurri-
cane. Two remarkable fruit trees are to be found in the garden
of Wester Elchies, viz. an apple tree, which extends along a brick
wall for the space of 78 feet in length by 11 in height, and a geen
tree which measures 10 feet in circumference, the branches over-
hanging a circular space of considerable extent. In the vicinity of,
the same garden is a silver fir, which measures 6 feet 7 inches in
circumference. Scotch firs and larches are the chief trees in than
plantations, and appear to thrive better than any others. The na-
tural wood consists principally of birch.  At Wester Elchies are
two large walnut trees, which in fine seasons generally yield plenty
of fruit.
