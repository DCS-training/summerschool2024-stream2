road at Auchinreach house on the East and the turnpike
road by Strathblane to Glasgow, on the the West; besides
these two great lines, the turnpike road from Edinburgh to
Glasgow by Falkirk, passes through Campsie for two miles;
and there are two cross branches which strike off to Kirkin-
tilloch; so that there are in all 20 English miles of road in
this district, 10 of which are kept up by the converted sta-
tute labour:  It will be easily believed that there are few dis-
tricts more complicably intersected, and, it may be added,
fewer still where the roads are better kept in order.  The
roads in this district, before the act for converting the statute
labour took place, were miserable indeed; for although the
labour of 10 L. plough-gates, according to the mode of three
days of a man and horse in spring, and as much in autumn
for each plough, might appear adequate to the purpose; still,
from the awkward and careless manner in which they
wrought, the roads were hardly passable in winter; at the
same time, I am convinced that this was as much owing to
the want of skill in the overseers as to the want of dexterity
in the labourers.  As to any positive advantage gained to the
public, from the conversion act, 12 s. per annum is by no
means equal to the labour of fix days of a man and a horse.
The sum levied in this parish varied exceedingly of late years,
owing to the increase of inhabitants; every cotter or house-
holder paying 2 s. per annum, it hath amounted to 70 L. per
annum, 50 of which is paid by the farmers and landholders,
and the other 20 L. by the cottars.  Till within these 3 years,
this sum was expended in making and repairing, and keep-
ing up 18 out of the 20 miles of road the parish contains:
Now by one great line of road being made a turnpikes the
whole money will be expended in future, in improving and
keeping up 10 miles, and in making such cross-cuts to the
