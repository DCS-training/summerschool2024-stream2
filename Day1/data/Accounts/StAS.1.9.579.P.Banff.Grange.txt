vantage, and the unequal and oppressive tax of statute-la-
bour, totally inadequate to the making or upholding such
an extent of road; besides that it is often misemployed, at
the will of the commissioners or directors of the district, on
private roads, while public ones are neglected.-The tax
upon coals also is a great grievance.  A great and precious
part of the year, both to the farmer and limer, must be
employed in providing and driving fuel; whereas, were it
not for the heavy tax upon coal, the farmer would gain
two months of the summer, which could be employed in
cultivating turnip, managing hay, working fallow, or pre-
paring manure; and, at the same time, be better served
with fuel, by bringing coal from the shore, when he car-
ried his grain thither; and the limers would find it their
interest also, to burn their lime partly with coal, rather
than with peat alone; because, instead of driving it some
miles farther to get a penny more for the boll, that they
may make as much as possible of their fuel, they could
burn more, and sell cheaper; and when they went to the
shore for coal, they could always carry a draught of lime
with them.  Some years ago, a very wet season compel-
led some of them to try coal, and they found a mixture of
peat and coal answer so well, that they continue to use a
little coal now and then.-The people also complain much
of the unequal and oppressive nature of the excise and di-
stillery laws.  The last partakes so much of the nature of
a monopoly, that the distillers, unless in a time of scarcity,
