     of Affint.

   Within less than one year preceding this (1794) date,
there are two schoolmasters; the parochial; the other very
humanely granted by the Honourable Society for propa-
gating Christian Knowledge.  The former has L. 8: 6: 8
Sterling yearly salary; the latter L. 12, which was obtained
by the application of a few gentlemen graziers here, and
the narrator gave his concurrence.

   Marriages, etc.-The nearest account that can be given,
after strict enquiry, is the following viz. 10 marriages and
20 baptisms, communibus annis.

   Burial Grounds.- As for burial places, at a considerable
distance one from the other, there are no less than fix. 1 ft,
At Ach-na-hi-glash, or Kirktown; 2d, At Ged-a-vo-lich,
by the west of Loch-Nedd; 3d, At Ardvare, where, as
formerly laid, there is plenty of marble under the heather,
which indeed the narrator came accidentally to know of, as
hehappened to be travelling alone, and missed the road-track;
4th, At Oldney Island; 5th, At the farm of Store; 6th,
At Inver farm, near the entry of Inver river to the har-
bour of spacious Loch Inver.  All these burial places are,
for the most part, inclosed with a dry stone fence.  The
inhabitants have a regard for the memory of their de-
parted friends and relations, perfectly detached from what
we call idolatry, as it only consists in doing all the good
possible to the survivers of the departed.

   State of the Poor, and their Funds.-Properly speaking,
though many here are poor, they cannot be represented as
a burden to the parish.  The natives are all connected by
alliance.  When any one becomes old and feeble, their
nearest relations build a little comfortable house for them,
