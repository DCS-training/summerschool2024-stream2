country parishes, that these tabernacles of iniquity should be
placed too close to the house of God.

   Church and School.-The church has lately been repaired;
but the manse, which, at first, was built very superficially,
and without offices, never was repaired, and is now in a ruin-
ous state.  The stipend is 92 bolls meal, 8 stone weight, and
about 23 l. money, including 5 l. for communion elements.
The whole, at the common conversion, not exceeding 66 l.
exclusive of the allowance for the elements.  To this the
glebe makes little addition, as it will hardly graze two cows,
if the four acres of arable, and these of the worst quality, are
cultivated.  The incumbent must dispense with the conve-
nience of having a horse, or find grass for him; rather a
hard alternative for a poor country parson.-The school sa-
lary is only 100 merks, and 50 s. arising from a mortification,
which, along with perquisites, may amount to about 20 l.
per annum; a miserable allowance to a man of genius for
employing his time and talents in qualifying the rising gene-
ration to fill up the vacant stations in society with honour.
What a reproach to the people of Scotland, that this most
useful class of citizens, in their late attempt for a small aug-
mentation of salary, could not find, among all those who re-
ceived the early benefit of their instruction, one to support
their honest cause!  At this rate, the ages of darkness will
again commence; and Scotland will, ere long, be as remark-
able for wealth and ignorance, as it was formerly for poverty
and learning.

   Wages.-A day-labourer has 1 s.; a taylor has 8 d. per
day, and his meat; a shoemaker 6 d. for each pair of shoes,
and his maintenance.  Servant men have from 4 l. 10 s. to
6 l. per annum, and servant maids from 2 l. 10 s. to 3 l.  It
