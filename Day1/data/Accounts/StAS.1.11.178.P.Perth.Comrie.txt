     (County of Perth-Presbytery of Auchterarder-Synod of

     Drawn up by the Rev. Mr. COLIN BAXTER, Minister of Mo-
     nivaird, from Materials chiefly collected by the Rev. Mr.
     HUGH M'DIARMED, Minister of Comrie.

     Origin of the Name.

   THIS parish takes its name from the village of COMRIE,
in which tile church stands.  Comrie is derived from
the Gaelic, Comb-ruidh, which signifies the confluence of two
rivers.  These are the Erne, and the Ruchil, which join their
streams a few yards to the westward of the church, and flow in
one body, till they fall into the Tay.  There is another pa-
rish called Tullichetil, united to Comrie.  The foundation of
the church, which is still visible, is surrounded by a pretty
large church-yard, and is distant from the village of Comrie
about a Scotch mile.  Tullichetil, in allusion to the dead
buried there, signifies in Gaelic, the plain of sheep.

   Extent.-The extent of this parish is very considerable,
being about 13 miles long, and between 9 and 10 broad.  It
