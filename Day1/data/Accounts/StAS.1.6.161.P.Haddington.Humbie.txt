some instances, needy and unskilful persons were preferred for
a mere trisle, and soon became insolvent.  This mode of let-

   In the higher parts of the parish the air is sharp and cold;
in the lower, it is more temperate.  So heathful, upon the
whole, is the climate, that epidemical distempers, when some-
times prevailing in neighbouring districts, seldom, and then
but partially, affect the inhabitants of this.  Rheumatism is
the disorder with which the lowest class of people are distres-
