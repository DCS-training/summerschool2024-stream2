			UNITED PARISHES OF

		      LETHENDY AND KINLOCH.

	PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

	THESE parishes were united in the year 1806.

		      PARISH OF LETHENDY.

		     1.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
		Boundaries.-Lethendy is bounded on the east by the parish of
	Blairgowrie; on the south by Caputh; and on the west and north
	by Clunie.
		Situation and Extent.-The extent of this parish in a direct
	line from east to west, is 5 miles. Its greatest breadth from south
	to north, 1 1/2 mile. It is bounded on the east by the burn of Lunan,
	which divides it form the parish of Blairgowrie; on the south,
	by Caputh, and on the west and north, by Clunie. From
	the eastern extremity, the ground rises gently westward the whole
	length of the parish, except on the west point, where it falls
	suddenly for about half a mile.
		Soil and Climate.-The west half of the parish is a black mould
	inclining to a reddish clay, excepting some small corners, exceedingly
	rich, and well adapted to all kinds of crops. Towards the
	east, the soil becomes blacker, more wet, and less productive.
	From the souther exposure of the parish, the climate is perhaps
	a little milder than that of the parishes immediately adjoining.
	The difference, however, is not material.

			II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

		Parochial Registers.-The first register extant of the kirk-session
        of Lethendy commences at the ordination of Mr. George
        Freer, 1698; the second in 1754; and the third in 1628. It
	is unfortunate that each of these register's has been devoted to several
	purposes, such as acts of church discipline, collections and
	distributions for the poor, marriages and baptisms, &c. Some of
	the register have, upon the whole, been well kept, but are much
	injured by having been exposed to damp. Others of them have
	been very carelessly kept for the last twenty or thirty years, owing.
