			  II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

   Ancient Land-owners.-Macduff, Thane of Fife, may be reck-
oned as one of these. This Earldom, after having been pos-
sessed by many of his descendants, came into the hands of Mor-
dac, Duke of Albany. He being beheaded at Stirling, his property
in Fife, Monteath, and elsewhere, was annexed to the Crown by
King James I., and the succeeding kings gave portions of it to their
favourites at different times. In particular, the lands of Den-
mill, which then comprehended the greatest part of the parish,
"were given by James II., in the fourteenth year of his reign, to his
beloved and familiar servant James Balfour, son of Sir John Bal-
four of Balgarvie." As a proof of this fact, the mills on this estate
are called the King's Mills in the charter of the present proprie-
tor. This family was always in great favour at court. One of them
followed James IV. to the battle of Flodden, and was killed there.
Sir James Balfour of Denmill and Kinnaird was Lyon King at Arms
to Charles I. and II., and an historian of considerable repute. The
funeral monuments of the family are to be seen in an aisle of the
old church. *
   John Lesly of Parkhill may be mentioned as the leader of the
band that cut off Cardinal Beaton. He first entered the Castle
of St Andrews, and gave the Cardinal the first mortal stroke with
his dagger.
