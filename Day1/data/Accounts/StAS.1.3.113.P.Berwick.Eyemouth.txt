a good quality; as well as sown grass, turnips, and potatoes.
The climate is dry, and perhaps as little rain falls here, as in
any other part of Scotland.

   Antiquities.-Here are the remains of a regular fortification
upon a small promontory stretching out to the sea, which is
said to have been erected by the Earl of Hertford, afterwards
Duke of Somerset, when going to invade Scotland, while he
held the regency, in the minority of Edward VI.  It was de-
molished by treaty in Queen Mary's reign, soon after the
battle of Pinkie.  Though all the rocks along the coast are
of the common hard whinstone, yet the promontory, upon
which this fortification has been built, consists of what is called
pudding stone.  It is remarkably hard, and will cut like mar-
ble, and even stands the fire.  The two piers were built
of it, which stand both weather and water without the least
appearance of waste.

   Harbour and Trade.-At the beginning of this century,
Eyemouth was a mere fishing town; but, after the Union, it
gradually increased; and, owing to its vicinity to England, it
became remarkable for smuggling; but that pernicious trade
being much qualified, the gentlemen of this county, amongst
their first improvements, erected a pier on the west side
of the harbour, about the year 1750, that cost about L. 2000,
which was raised by subscription; and, about the year 1770,
another pier was built upon the east side of the harbour,
which cost above L. 2500; which last pier was planned and
executed by Mr Smeaton.

   "The harbour of Eyemouth," Mr Smeaton remarks," lies
at the corner of a bay, in which ships can work in and out at
all times of tide, or lie at an anchor secure from all wind
