                  Agriculture.--
                          Number of acres in the parish cultivated,             2820
                                          never cultivated,                      160
                                          under plantation, about                450

                  Rent.--Average rent per acre, about L.1, 12s.;  valued rent of
               the parish, L.3472, 1s. 8d.; real rental of the parish, about
               L. 4600.
                  Draining is the most important agricultural improvement, which
               of late years has been carried on to a considerable extent in the
               parish.
                  Agriculture is in as high a state of improvement as in the neigh-
               bouring parishes.  The farms are in general of moderate size.
                                      V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
                  A turnpike road now runs through the parish, and the paro-
               chial roads are in tolerably good condition.
                  The village of Craig may now be said to be almost extinct,
               and in its place is substituted the new and thriving village of St
               David's, consisting of about thirteen or fourteen feus.  At the
               village of St David's, there has also been erected, within the last
               seven years, by Lady Preston Baird, an elegant and commodious
               school and school-house, both highly ornamental and useful.
               The school was principally designed by her Ladyship for sewing
               and knitting, and children there also receive the first rudiments
               of education before they are able to attend the parochial school.

               The female teacher has from her Ladyship an annual salary of
               L. 10, free house, and several other perquisites.  This, if properly
               conducted, will be a most useful and efficient institution.  The
               estate of Craig of Maderty, upon which St David's is built, the
               property of Lady Preston Baird, enjoys the peculiar privilege and
               advantage of having been erected, in 1626, into a free burgh of
               barony, by the late Lord John Maderty, in virtue of a charter
               under the Great Seal, which was ratified and confirmed in the
               Scottish Parliament.
