beginning, and only beginning, to be sown, and the advan-
tages of them to be known.  As there are, however, hardly
any inclosures, and every farmer, almost every cottager,
keeps some sheep, they are with difficulty guarded in the
winter.  The turnips must indeed, in general, be taken up,
as there is no preserving of them.
   The people are sober, and very industrious.  There are
few that do not make their own ploughs and carts, and also
their brogues or shoes.
   The parish is the property of one heritor, (the Earl of
Fife); and contains, by a very exact list taken last winter,
(1795), 449 souls; 229 males, 220 females.  The average
of deaths, for eight years, is about 8.  The population, ac-
cording to Dr Webster's account, in 1755, was 430.
   The names of places, almost without exception, are de-
rived from the Gaelic, as Badenyon, which gives name to
an excellent song; and means, as is said, the Bird's Bush, or
Thicket.
   There are no funds for the support of the poor but the
weekly collections, which are small.  Luckily there are
seldom any that require constant supply.  Six or seven re-
ceive a few shillings twice or thrice in the year.
   As the parish is small, so the stipend is perhaps the
smallest in Scotland.  The kirk, manse, and offices, were all
lately rebuilt.
   The parish lies at a great distance from every market-
town.  Aberdeen, the post-town, is above 30 miles off.
To it the people must carry whatever they have for sale,
and from thence all their necessaries are procured.  None
but those who have felt it can imagine how inconvenient
it is to be at such a distance from a post-office and market-
town, when, for fix or eight weeks, sometimes all communi-
cation is stopped.
