excepted, lately purchased by Captain Christie of Bal-
christie.

   Fisheries.-There are 8 fishermen belonging to this parish.
They have houses, rent free, from Sir John Anstruther, su-
perior of this place, on condition of their supplying the town
of Ely with fish, at least three times a week.  They are well
situated for carrying on the fisheries, and, on the whole, are
pretty successful.

   Lake.-There is a beautiful lake, called Kilconquhar Loch,
bounded by that parish and Ely.  In it there are plenty of
pikes and eels.  The fishing, however, is of no great value,
and will naturally be more fully described in the Statistical
Account of Kilconquhar.

   Poor.-The session here maintains all its poor.  No beg-
gars belong to the parish.  There are about 20 regular pen-
sioners, who receive a small sum monthly, besides others
who get charity occasionally, as their wants require.  The
funds for their support amount to about 50 l. per annum.

   Inclosures.-The whole parish was inclosed with ditch and
hedge by Sir John Anstruther.  The inclosures are kept in
great order, and are very flourishing.  The burgh acres,
near the town, anno 1790, let at about 40 s. and the large
farms at 30 s. per acre, but have since risen.  Burgh acres
now (anno 1795) let at between 50 s. and 60 s. the acre; and
large farms between 40 s. and 50 s. Sir John Anstruther
lately let a farm, of near 100 acres, at 3 l. per acre.

   Fuel.-Coal is the only fuel used here.  There is an ex-
cellent coalwork, belonging to Sir John Anstruther, 3 miles
