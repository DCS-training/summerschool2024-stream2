On Denhead moor, in the S. W. corner of this parish, and
on the confines between it and that of Cameron, a coal-
mine belonging to Mr Martin of Denbrae, has sometimes
been wrought to a small extent.  On the same moor, Mr
Durham of Largo has a coal.  None of these are now oc-
cupied.  Two or three years ago, some Englishmen, judg-
ing from the appearance of the ground, expected to find
coal in many different parts of the parish, and entered into
contract with several proprietors; but, after expending a
good deal of money in boring, etc. they were disappointed.
In the face of a freestone rock, overhanging the sea-beach
between the castle and the harbour, there is an excavation
seemingly artificial; it is nearly round, about 10 feet dia-
meter, and the same height.  On the east side of it, the
rock is shaped into the form of a table or altar, and on the
S. W. side is an aperture of the ordinary size and shape of
a door by which you go into a small closet, supposed to
have been the cell of a hermit; the access to it is now ve-
ry difficult.  In the face of the rock on which the castle
stands, are the remains of such another excavation; from
the east side of this, is a perforation through which a man
may easily creep, into a smaller one, which is also open to
the sea, over which the rock hangs; this cave also is of very
difficult access.  About a mile east from the harbour, there
is a natural cave of ealier access, Kinkell cave.  The
mouth is to the north; the direction of the cave is south-
wards; the shelving of the freestone roof makes a cross sec-
tion of the cave, triangular; there is a continual dropping
from the roof.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls then was 4590.  I have had access to no data,
by which the ancient state of the population of this parish
can be guessed at.  A process now in dependence before
