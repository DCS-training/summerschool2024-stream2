condition that the saint would lend his assistance in dislodging
them. The superstitious soldiers, thinking this too good an offer
for any saint to reject, made themselves sure of St John's co-ope-
ration, and entered with alacrity into the plans of their leader;
who, being now sufficiently reinforced, sent a detachment round
by the head of the den, and these, fetching a compass by the
south-west, succeeded in gaining possession of the top of the hill,
directly over the Danish main camp, and, by rolling down large
stones upon the invaders, obliged them to abandon it, and to make
their escape by the north-east brow of the hill which overhangs
the sea, where manv were killed in the flight; whence the place
obtained the name of Ghaemrie, or the running battle. After
being dislodged from the east, the Danes formed a new camp,
(where the entrenchments are still to be seen), which still preserv-
ed their communication with the sea, and also with an extensive
barren plain on the top of the hill. Meantime the whole Scottish
army, in fulfilment of their leader's vow, set to work and built the
church on the spot where the Danes first settled, while both par-
ties were waiting additional reinforcements. The Danes having
been joined by a party of their countrymen who had landed at
Old haven of Cullen, about four miles westward, made a success-
ful attack on the Scots, and drove them back to the castle hill;
and, in spite to Saint John for assisting their enemies, they pollut-
ed his sanctuary by making it a stable for their horses. By this
time, however, the alarm had spread far and wide, and the Scots,
pouring in from all quarters, not only forced back the Danes to
their old position on the brow of the hill, but, getting possession
of the whole heights, and enclosing them on all sides except that
overhanging the sea, they again commenced their murderous work
of rolling down stones, while the helpless Danes could neither op-
pose nor escape, and then rushing dnwn upon them, sword is
hand, the Scots cut them to pieces to a man. The Bleedy pots
(Bloody pits) is still the name of the place, which, being incap-
able of cultivation from its steepness and exposure to the north
blasts, remains to this day in statu quo. Besides the round,
the crescent, and various angled figures in the ground, the
graves of the Danes are yet to be seen, sunk and hollow, among
the rank brown heather, green at the bottom, and surrounded at
the borders with harebells and whortleberries, with fragments of
rock and large detached stones lying around and covered with
moss.
