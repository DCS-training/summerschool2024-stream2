     of Cupar of Fife.

The prices of provisions vary little, in the countries adjoining
to Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, etc.  The vicinity of these
great towns did not contribute, in any great degree, to raise
the price of provisions, till within the last 30 years.  An in-
creased population, and new modes of life, have of late oc-
casioned an immense additional consumption of fish, poultry,
etc.-In the Cupar market, beef, mutton, pork, and veal,
sell at an average at 4 d. per lib.  Dutch weight; hens, 13 d.
each; geeses 3 s. each; rabbits, 6 d. per pair; pigeons, 3 d.
per pair; butter, 9 d. per lib.; best cheese, 5 d.; coarse
cheese, 3 d. tron weight; oat meal, 13 d. per peck; pota-
toes, 4 1/2 d.; eggs) 4 d. per dozen; salmon, 5 d. per lib.-
Though the price of provisions is thus high, and though
there has been alsoo a great rise on the necessary articles of
leather, soap, salt, candles, etc. yet the labourer at present is
better lodged, better fed and clothed, and can give a more de-
cent education to his children, than his father, who paid only
6 d. or 7 d. for a peck of oat meal; 1 1/2 d. for beef and mut-
ton per lib.; who bought eggs at 1 d. per dozen; butter at
5 d. per lib.; cheese at 1 1/2 d.; and haddocks in abundance
at 1 d. or 2 d. per dozen.  This improvement in the situa-
tion of the labourer is owing chiefly to these causes: 1st,
The proportion of the price of his own labour, and that of
his family, to the price of provisions, is more in his savour
than at any preceding period.  2dly, The introduction of the
potatoe, which has been long in general cultivation, affords
a rast additional supply of food to the labourer and, his fa-
mily, and enables him, at the same time, to rear pigs and
poultry.  3dly, He can depend on being employed during
the course of the whole year, an advantage which his father,
who received only 5 d. or 6 d. for his day's work, could not
always command.
