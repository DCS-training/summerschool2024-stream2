able extent, yet it had a very poor appearance.  Since that period
53 new houses have been built; many additional feus have been
granted by Mr M'Dowall the proprietor; and the population,
the wealth and the industry of its inhabitants have been in-
creased in a most surprising degree, within a very short time.
The local situation of Lochwinnoch is extremely favourable,
from its being in the neighbourhood of coal, lime, and free-
stone, and from its being abundantly supplied with fine spring
water; but its rapid increase has been principally occasioned
by the erection of two large cotton mills, by Messrs Henston,
Burns and Co. and Messrs Johnstons and Co.  The mill erec-
ted by Messrs Henston, Burns and Co, employs at present
140, and when finished will employ about 350 people.  The
wheel is 24 feet diameter, and is supplied with water from
a circular dam, built across the river Calder, 19 feet 8 inches
high, and 85 feet in circumference: the number of spindles
in this mill will amount to 9144.  The mill erected by
Messrs Johnstons and Co, which is 164 feet long, 33 feet
wide, and 35 feet high, is supplied with water from the mill
of Messrs Henston, Burns and Co, employs at present 240
people, and when the machinery is completed, will employ
600: the wheel is 22 feet in diameter and 10 feet broad; the
spindles in this mill will amount to 19,485 A cotton mill
has been erected half a mile from the village, on a smaller
scale, which will employ about 80 people:  Messrs Johnstons
and Co. are at present procuring a very large field, adjoin-
ing to their cotton mill, for bleaching, which is carried on
with great activity and spirit by Mr Henry Wilson, in a dif-
ferent part of the parish: 339,612 yards of dimities, musli-
nets, jaconets, and booked muslins, from 10 d. to 20 s. per
yard, and, 4000. Spinels of thread and yarn, were bleached by
him in 1791 and 45 people were employed in the work.
