not be at the trouble to employ either the one or the other,
though they have been repeatedly told what wonderful es-
fects they have produced in fertilizing the soil in other parts
of the kingdom.  Even the dung of their cattle, which is at
their hand, and which is so generally considered as an excel-
lent manure, rather than be at the pains to carry to their
fields, they in some places throw into the sea, by way of
a peace offering to Neptune, in order to render him pro-
pitious in casting a-shore for them plenty of sea-weed,
which is the only substance they consider as a valuable ma-
nure.  As they have been accustomed, time out of mind, to
sow the grain they have raised on their own farms, no ar-
guments can prevail with them to change their seed; and,
what is far worse, they have conceived an opinion that seed,
however ill ripened and ill dressed, however light and bad it
may be, will produce a crop in every respect as good as what
would have been produced by the very best seed of the coun-
try.
   Under all these, and some other disadvantages, the Ork-
ney Islands, in ordinary years, produce as much grain as is
sufficient to maintain about 24,000 inhabitants, after setting
aside near one third of the crop as feu-duty, which is fre-
quently carried out of the kingdom.  A more substantial
proof cannot be brought of the fertility of any country, than
its producing, at a moderate price, even under bad cultiva-
tion, as much as is necessary for its own consumption.  This
is certainly the case with ours, for we have, in ordinary years,
malt at 10 s. per boll, oat meal at half a guinea, and bear meal
at 8 s. Sterling.
   From this general charge of bad farming, we must exempt
most of our gentlemen, as well those that rent farms from
others, as those that are their own property.  Some of them
continue, in a great measure, the old plan, intermixing it
