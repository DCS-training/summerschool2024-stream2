heritors to L.20, in consequence of the sacrament being dispensed
twice a year.
   East or quoad sacra Parish Church.-This church was opened
as a preaching station in connection with the Established Church in
October 1834. The Rev. James Yuilie was inducted minister in
1835.  The church is seated for 700 persons, and the number of
communicants (February 1837) was 415.  The stipend is L.120
per annum, and, in the event of tbe revenue amounting to L.200,
the stipend is to be augmented to L.150.  There is an endow-
ment of L. 10 in aid of the revenue.
   Episcopal Chapel.-The present church was erected in 1814.
It is seated for 800 persons.  The number belonging to the con-
gregation is from 1400 to 1500.
   United Associate Congregation.-The church belonging to this
congregation is calculated to contain about 450 sitters.  The late
Mr John Robertson, farmer in Collielaw, in this parish, mortified
some property, for behoof of the Seceders in Windmill Street,
which, since that congregation ceased to exist, has been transferred
to this congregration.  The property yields about L.80 per an-
num, of which L.10 is applied to charitable purposes, and the re-
mainder towards payment of the clergyman's stipend.
   Independents.-The place of worship of this congregation, for-
merly belonging to the Secession, is not quite so large as that be-
longing to the United Associate congregation.  The number of
persons belonging to this congregation has not been ascertained;
but it is believed that it has rather been on the decrease of late.
   Methodists.-There is a place of worship belonging to this sect,
capable of containing about 200 persons.  They are supplied with
a preacher once a fortnight from Aberdeen.  The conrega-
tion is understood not to be equal to the extent of accommodation
in the church.
   Members of Established Church.-The number of families at-
tending the parish church has not been precisely ascertained; it
probably amounts to 1000,-the whole number of families in the
town and parish being about 1700.  The number of persons of
all ages connected with the Established Church is not less than
5000, the gross population being reckoned 8000 which must be
very near the truth; for, adding to 6695, the population according
to the census in 1831, 1000 as the number of seamen who were
not included, and 305 as the probable increase for the last six-
years, we, have 8000.
