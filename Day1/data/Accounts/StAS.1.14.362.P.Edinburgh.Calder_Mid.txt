   Valuation of the Lands, etc.-The ancient value set
upon the lands of this parish, by which the taxes af-
fecting the property in land are paid, amounts to 5157 L.
10 s. Scotch money; the present rental of the whole pa-
rish is about 2519 L. Sterling.  The produce of the dif-
ferent farms, besides a considerable quantity of hay,
which is sold at Edinburgh and other places, feeds 480
black cattle, 200 horses, and 2300 sheep.  Horses are
more numerous here than in some other parts, as the
farmers rear several for the market.  Comparatively
speaking, there are few swine or pigs in the parish.

   Hunting, Fishing, Fowling, etc.-Foxes are not scarce
in the parish, and hares are very numerous.  There are
plenty of trouts in the rivers near this town, and a few
eels; but no salmon come so far up the Almond as Mid-
Calder.  In favourable seasons, the sportsman may find
no inconsiderable number of grouse, partridges, wood-
cocks, and snipes in the parish.  We have here the
blackbird and thrush, the lark, linnet, and goldfinch,
as well as the other fowls and birds which are common
in  general to Scotland.  In Calder wood the bullfinches

*Though there be no poor's rates established by law in Scotland, yet
by old acts of the Scotch parliament, the landlords are required to re-

are empowered to raise one half of the money, which they lay out for
this purpose, from the inhabitants of the parish, who are not on the poor's
roll.
