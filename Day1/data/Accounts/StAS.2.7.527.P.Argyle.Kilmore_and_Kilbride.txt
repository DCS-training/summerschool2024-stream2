prietor of Dunolly.  A few other relics of olden times are still
preserved in the family:--a finely executed bronze equestrian
figure of Eian Bacach, or lame John, who was defeated by Ro-
bert Bruce at the Pass of Awe; a brass gun, presented by
James VII. to Allan M'Dougall of Dunolly; a medal given to
John, the son of Allan, by the Chevalier St George, for whom
John led his clan to the unfortunate field of Sheriffmuir; and,
what was once perhaps more highly estimated than all these, a
pair of transparent crystal balls, about the size of pigeon's eggs,
and which reflect light in all the hues of the rainbow.  Tradition
says, a Lord of Lorn, who joined the Crusaders,  brought these
stones from the Holy Land.  They were for centuries supposed
to possess great healing virtues, particularly in curing diseases of
cattle, when it is said they were dipped in water which the cattle
received to drink.  It is not a cedtury since they were sent for by
express, a distance of forty miles, to stay the ravages of an epi-
demic.  These stones used to be regarded with reverential awe ;
but, since the schoolmaster came abroad, they are less sought after.
