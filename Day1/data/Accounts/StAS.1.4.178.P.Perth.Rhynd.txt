     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH OF RYND,

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM TAYLOR.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, Surface, etc.

   THE name, in Gaelic , is said to signify 'a point;' and
both the parish and the estate of Rynd, probably
took this name from the point of land where the rivers
Tay and Earn meet, about half a mile below the church.
The parish is situated in the county of Perth, in the pres-
bytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling.  It ex-
tends from the point mentioned, more than 4 miles along
the river Tay, and meets the parish of Perth at Orchard-
nook.  it is about a mile in breadth;  the line that divides
it from the parish of Dumbarnie on the one side, being
nearly parallel to the winding course of the Tay on the
other;  so that the form of the parish is nearly oblong, ha-

people) placed almost in one of the angles.  it is bounded by
the parishes of Perth and Dumbarnie on the W.;  by that of
Abernethy on the S. from which it is separated by the ri-
ver Earn;  and on the E. and N. by the parishes of St Ma-
dois and Kinsauns, from which it is separated by the Tay-
