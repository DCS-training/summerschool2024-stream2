   Woods, Natural and Planted.-The soil and climate of this district
appear to be particularly favourable to the growth of trees. The indi-
genous are, oak, ash. birch, mountain-ash, alder, hazel, bird-cherry,
hawthorn, holly; and, of some of these kinds, not a few attain to a very
great size. The plantations consist chiefly of larch and Scotch fir.
There are intersperses, however, through these plantations, or there
occur, either in groups by themselves, or in lines, a vast number of
beeches, elms, sycamores, limes, chestnuts, both horse and Spanish,
spruces, Weymouth pines, silver firs, geans, laburnums, whitebeams,
&c. The lanrel, Prunus laurocerasus, is found in great profusion
and of most luxuriant growth; as is also the Portuguese laurel,
Prunus Luntanious, though by no means in such plenty. You will
likewise meet occassionally with fine specimens of the cedar, the
