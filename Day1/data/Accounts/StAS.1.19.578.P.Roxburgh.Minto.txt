     Statistical Account

   Character.-The inhabitants are honest, sober, and in-
dustrious; seem contented with their situation, as no mur-
ders, suicides, or criminal prosecutions, are remembered to
have happened.  The farmers, in general, are respectable
well informed people, pay great attention to husbandry, to
the rearing and feeding of stock.  The air is good; sel-
dom visited with any epidemical diseases.  There are no
public-houses within the parish.  I have not been able to
discover any antiquities or natural curiosities but such as
are common, viz. stone coffins, petrifying springs, large
deers horns, &c. found in mosses.
