and easy; and the lodgings for strangers are much improved, af-
fording also far more extensive accomodation.  Even the pub-
lic roads and walks around the village have been considerably
improved.  Nuisances of all sorts are carefully interdicted, and
measures taken generally for making such important and exten-
sive improvements, as have raised the character of Moffat to be
one of the most attractive watering villages, and one of the most
comfortable places of residence; and these improvements being
under the eye as well as the patronge of the family of Annadale,
who take pleasure, and have an interest, in the property of Moffat,
there is no doubt of their being carried on as far as the public
ought to expect.
  In the cultivation of the arable soils a very great improvement
has been made; and by removing obstructions, duly manuring and
working the lands, observing a proper improved rotation, and keep-
ing down or destroying noxious weeds,--and farther, by cultivating
the most valuable crops, it is not too much to say, that within forty
years the returns of the arable soils have become far better, as well
as more abundant.  The single practice of feeding off sheep on
turnip lands has been of incalculable benefit.
  As to stocks, if the village cows be excepted, which are pastured,
it is believed, in too great numbers, and if we also except some
of the cottagers' cows, the quality of the cattle has been very much
improved, and the sheep stocks perhaps even more so, within the
last forty years; and sheep stocks perhaps even more so, within the
last forty years; and whatever the prices may now be, affected as
these are by various caused, and among others by the state of the
currency, the improvement in quality has been certain and exten-
sive.
   Let any one now look into the cottages, and he will find them
nearly or fully as comfortable as the farm-houses were forty years
ago; and let him compare the dress of the cottagers and their mode
of living with that of the farmers at the above distance of time, he
will find that at present they are not greatly inferior.
   And yet it is certain there is a tendency to depression, chiefly
arising out of want of employment and reduced rates of wages,
both of which are partly to be ascribed to the influx of labourers
from Ireland; the remedy for which is neither very easy nor ver
obvious.  The wandering poor are now sent to individual houses to
which they belong; but they are not encouraged, as formerly, to
wander across the country, and to haunt any where in it at their
