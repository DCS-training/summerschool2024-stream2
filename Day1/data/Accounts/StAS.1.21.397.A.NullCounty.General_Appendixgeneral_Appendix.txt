An expence at much under which they might all easily be
purchased, if they could possibly be obtained for hire.
   From the above statement it would appear, that (exclud-
ing the present high taxes) the profit or the loss upon the
glebe and farm in conjunction, must be very trifling.  If,
however, I were confined to the possession of the glebe by
itself, (as I must keep the same servants and cattle to ma-
nage the glebe, as I do to manage both it and the farm, and
as with nearly equal expence of management, the profitable
return must be greatly curtailed,) the loss would be conside-
rable.
