  Amount of Raw Produce.-This, with the expense of raising,
way be stated as follows :

<TABLE>

1400 arable acres in corn, value of corn and straw at
   L. 7 per acre,                                  L. 9800
Expenses ploughing, seed, cutting, &c. at L. 2, 10s.
   per acre,	                                 	      L. 3500  = L. 6300
700 acres green crop at L. 7 per acre,                4900
Expenses ploughing, manuring, sowing, hoeing, &c.
 at L. 5 per acre,                                             3500  =    1400
900 arable acres in bay or pasture, at L. 3 per acre, 2700
Expenses fencing and cutting, at 10s. per acre,                 450  =    2250
2000 acres in permanent pasture at L. 1, 5s.	         3500
Expences fencing, herding, draining, &c. at 5s. per acre,       500  =    3000
500 acres in wood, cuttings and thinnings,	          200
Expenses felling and pruning,              		          100  =     100
                                                      ____    _____      _____

                                                 L. 21,100  L. 8050  L. 13,050

  Of the L. 13,050, stated above as the actual profit derived from
the soil, about one-third forms the remuneration which the farmer
receives for his trouble and outlay of money in stocking, draining,
liming, &c.; the other two-thirds go to the landlord for rent. Of
late, the value of the different articles enumerated has fallen short
of the amount above stated. The valued rent of the parish is near-
ly L. 8000.
  Manufactures.-The only manufacture worthy of notice is the
weaving of linens. The value of the labour employed in it may be
between L. 2000 and L. 3000 per annum. The hours of labour
are very long, and allow little time for reading or relaxation. Our
manufactures, therefore, can hardly be said to afford a fair remu-
neration to those employed, or to be favourable to health aud morals.
                     V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
  The nearest market-town is Cupar, which is five miles and a-half
from the church of Monimail. There are three villages in the pa-
rish. Letham contains 440 inhabitants; Monimail, 80; and Easter
Fernie, 60. The nearest post-office is at Cupar. Three different
lines of turnpike pass through the parish, containing in all ten miles
of road, and as much more is kept in repair by the statute labour
assessment. There are no canals, railways, or public conveyances.
  Ecclesiastical State.-The situation of the church and manse is
far from convenient. They are scarcely a mile from the one end
of the parish, and are fully five miles from the other. The church
was built in 1796. It is rather a handsome building, with a tower
at the east end, and is in thorough repair. It affords accommo-
dation for nearly 600 persons. The seats are allotted to the in-
habitants according to the properties on which they reside. The
manse was built in 1790, and is still in excellent condition. The
