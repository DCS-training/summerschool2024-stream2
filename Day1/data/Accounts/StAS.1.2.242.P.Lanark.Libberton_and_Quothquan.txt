penned vaults, which were certainly erected, as asylums for
cattle.  For it is a well known fact, that while war and tumult
occupied the attention of men, in this country, animal food
was their principal support; and the lands that were under
grain, were all bounded by earthen mounds, and divided by
run-ridge, among the inhabitants, proportionably to their re-

fortification, or camp.  It stands on the edge of a high, and
barren muir, about half a mile from the Clyde; and com-

double wall of earth:  between the walls, there is a deep ditch,
or vallum.  There is no appearance of any stone work about
it, except in the middle, which seems to have been coarsely
paved with free-stone.  About 300 yards to the south, there
is a free-stone quarry, out of which, these stones have been
