as well as day), requires considerable extent of housing.
Though heritors furnish wood for the first creation, or give
allowance to the tenant upon his removal, till he is exposed
to considerable expence.  Seeing they hold their possessions
without any lease, and being themselves but in straitened cir-

are gainers by this new branch of business whatever advan-
