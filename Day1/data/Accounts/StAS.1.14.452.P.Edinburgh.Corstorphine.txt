   Agriculture.-Agriculture, in its different departments,
is conducted in this parish according to the most improv-
ed modes adopted in Scotland, or the bordering counties

green or meliorating crops, are observed in the rotations.
But the mode of conducting these is often varied by the
most judicious farmers, and which arises from a circum-
stance of local advantage, their access to procure dung
from Edinburgh; by this means, they are enabled to raise
crops from their lands in a succession, which those who

their systems of management than is observed here.  Par-
ticular attention is paid to raising of potatoes, which is
here conducted with great success, and for which Edin-

and which being a profitable crop on high rated land, is
necessary for defraying the expense laid out in preparing
the ground for the potatoe crop.  To bring an acre of a
potatoe crop to market, amounts to an expense of 10 l.,
on land rented at 2 l. the acre.  Dung 4 l.; ploughing,
planting, and dressing, 2 l. 10 s.; rent, 2 l.; carrying to
