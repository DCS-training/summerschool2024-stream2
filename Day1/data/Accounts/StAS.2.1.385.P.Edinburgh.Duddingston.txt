 The trees around the pleasure grounds of Duddingston House,
and the mansion of Sir Robert Keith Dick, are, oak, ash, beech,
hornbeam, cedar, English elm, thorn, birch, silver and balm of
Gilead firs, holly, plane, lime, Spanish chestnut, and willow; but
none of them is remarkable for its size. There was a hawthorn
tree which grew very near the western gate, close by the road side,
which leads from Portobello to the village of Wester Duddingston,
of remarkable age and size, which had long been an object of parti-
cular attraction for its beauty when in blossom, as the largest haw-
thorn in Scotland; but this venerable tree was blown down by the
storm in May 1840. There is also an ash growing in the cen-
tre of the manse garden, measuring II feet six inches in circum-
ference; and several large willows on the property of Sir Robert
Keith Dick, about II feet.

                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

perty of the Duke of Lauderdale, and passed with a daughter
of his first Duchess, under the name of pin-money, to the family
of Argyle, to whose first Duke she was married.
  It is mentioned as a historical fact, that, when the greater
portion of this parish was forest, particularly what was called
the Figget Whins, it afforded shelter to the brave Sir Wil-
liam Wallace and his bold companions when the were on
their way to attack Berwick. It also stated that the Scotch
leaders, before the battle of Dunbar, demanded a confe-
rence with the Usurper, Cromwell, who 1 consented to meet
them, on the following day, half-way between Leith and Mossel-
burgh rocks, at low water, upon the sands, each party to be
companied by 100 men on horse back. Any question they might
choose to propose, be agreed to answer, but declined admitting of
any animadversion or reply. A part of this curious conference is
said to have, been in the following words: "Why did you put
