   Climate.-From the situation of these islands, in a north-
ern latitude, and surrounded-by the ocean, the diseases in-
cident to a cold and damp climate might naturally be ex-
pected; but the reverse happens.  The ague is not known
here, and scorbutic complaints seldom occur; owing, per-
haps, to the abundance of fuel, to the frequent use of vege-
tables, and of malt liquor; and above all, to the salubrious
sea-breezes, which cool the air in summer, and counteract
the frosts in winter, and render the climate, upon the whole,
more temperate, than in many places of a more southerly
latitude upon the continent.  The small-pox was much
dreaded here previous to the 1757, when inoculation was
introduced, and has ever since been attended with uncom-
mon success.  Consumptions are not frequent.  The most
prevalent distempers are fevers, which frequently prove
fatal, especially in years of sterility.  Rheumatisms have
become more frequent of late years, owing, it is supposed,
to the substitution of the linen shirt for the woolen waist-
coat, formerly worn by the common people.

   Mineral Springs-are to be met with in every district of
the parish.  But the one most in vogue is the water of
Scoridale, which has been famous for time immemorial, and
is supposed to cure all diseases.  It, like all the others, is of
the chalybeate kind, without any mixture of sulphur.  It
is of a diuretic and antiscorbutic quality, and helps to pro-
mote digestion.

   Lakes, Coasts, Islands, and Fisheries.-There are in this
parish several small rivulets, but only one lake, called the
Loch of Kirbister.  It is between two and three miles in
circumference, and is well stored with sea-trout of an ex-
cellent quality.  The fall from this lake is very consider-
able, and turns one of the finest mills in the country.  Here
