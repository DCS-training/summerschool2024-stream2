where, at least, between thirty and forty children must be born
of Dissenting parents yearly, there are not as many of them re-
corded in the parochial registers for the last twenty years. With
regard to the register of deaths, it may be observed that, for many
years, a very faithful record was kept, while the kirk-session's
mortcloth was used, but since it has become fashionable to use
those of private societies, or, what is now much more common, none
at all, no authentic record of the mortality which takes place with-
in the parish is kept.
   Land-owners.-The principal heritors in the parish, of which
there are 65, are, Mr Bruce of Falkland; P. G. Skene of Hall-
yards; and Andrew Murray, Esp. sheriff-depute of Aberdeenshire.
The valued rent of the parish is L.5783, 9s. 10d. Scots; the real
rent is L.5900 Sterling. The following are the qualified heritors
of the parish, with their respective valuations:

   Mansion Houses.-Myres Castle is the only mansion of any con
sideration in the parish. It was long the residence of the Mon-
crieffs of Reedie, the ancestors of P. G. Skene, Esq. who sold
the estate of Myres, together with the patronage of Auchter-
muchty, to the late Mr Bruce, the King's printer for Scotland,
about twenty years ago. Although a large addition was made to
the castle about fifteen years ago, and the house is capable of ac-
commodating a large family, the present proprietor has never taken
up his residence here. The pleasure-grounds are not very exten-
sive, including only a park of about thirty acres, while the lands on
every side are perhaps too valuable for agricultural purposes ever
to extend it beyond the present boundary. Bellevue, the property
of Mr Marshall Gardiner, and Southfield, the property of Messrs
Moncrieff, are very pleasing places of residence.
