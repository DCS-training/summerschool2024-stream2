elements. The glebe, though of legal measure, is one of the poor-
est, and would not let to a tenant for L. 3 a-year.
  The Dissenters in the parish amount to about one-third of the
whole population.
  Education.-The school and schoolmaster's house have been
lately rebuilt. They are capacious and airy buildings, and finish-
ed in a superior style. The schoolmaster's salary is the maximum,
and, with the session-clerkship and school fees, which are very
low, may amount to between L. 60 and L. 70 a year. Every one
without exception learns to read.
   Poor.-The poor on the roll for monthly supply are 30 in num-
ber at present,-besides others who need occasional supplies. Our
collections at the church are only about L. 20 or L. 21 a-year, and
the heritors contribute about L. 100.
  Inns, &c.--In the parish we have 10 houses licensed to retail ex-
ciseable spirits, &c.-5 along the thoroughfare road, 4 in the village
of Kettle, and 1 in the Coalton 5f Burnturk.
   Fuel.--We are mostly supplied with coal from Balbirnie, about,
four miles distant, at 1s. 3d. a load, counted 18 stone; but we have
Balgonie, Dysart, and Clunie within our reach, at all which coal-
hills the load is heavier, and the price less.
