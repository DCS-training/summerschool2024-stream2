     TOWN AND PARISH OF STIRLING.

     (County and Presbytery of Stirling.-Synod of Perth and Stir-
     ling.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES SOMMERVILLE, one of the Ministers of
     that Town.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE town and parish of Stirling have the same name.
In all records of any antiquity, it is written Stryveline,
or Stryveling; and it is conjectured to have derived this name
from the Scotch word Stryve, because of the frequent conten-
tions about the possession of it, which arose among the differ-
ent clans, in the days of ancient feud and barbarism.  This,
however, is mere conjecture, as all disquisitions about the
origin of names generally are.  Buchanan and other Latin au-
thors uniformally call it Sterlinum.  The town's ancient real
has, on one:  side, a crucifix erected on a bridge, with this in-
scription, Hic armis Bruti, Scoti stant hac cruce tuti.  On the
reverse is a fortalice, surrounded with trees, with the inscrip-
tion, Continet hoc nemus et castrum Strivilense.  The town has
another real, which contains the arms, viz.  A Wolf upon a
rock, inscribed Oppidum Sterlini.
