loway have hitherto enjoyed, in a very great degree, the
valuable blessing of peace and unanimity in their religious
sentiments.  Dissension of any kind has been less known than
in almost any other part of Scotland.  There are few Sece-
ders in this parish from the established Church.  There are,
however, two or three families of Antiburghers and M'Mil-
lanites.  One of the clergymen of the latter sect has his resi-
dence in the parish, although the number of his adherents is
very small.  He preaches occasionally in different parts of
Galloway, and at home only by turns.  The amount of the
stipend is 72 L. 4 s. Sterling.  The glebe consists of 20 acres
of land, 10 of which are arable.  The value of the living,
exclusive of the houses and garden, may be about 84 L. per
annum.  The number of poor persons upon the parish-roll is
at present 25.  These receive about 30 L. per annum, which is
distributed to them quarterly.  This sum arises almost en-
tirely from the collections made on the Sabbath, a very small
part of it only being the interest of some money left for their
behoof.  From this account of the matter, it appears that
the poor are but very indifferently provided for.  The heri-
tors have never been assessed, although this is a measure
which it would certainly be prudent and humane to adopt.

   Prices of Labour and Provisions.-The prices of labour are
various.  In husbandry, during spring, summer, and harvest,
the labourer receives 1 s. per day at ordinary works.  For
cutting peats, 1 s. 4 d.; for cutting hay, 1 s. 6 d.  A woman
at weeding, etc. 6 d.  But, at reaping, both men and women
receive 1 s.  In winter, a man gets 10 d.  The labourer who
is hired by the year, and has a family, is generally paid by
what is called a benefit.  This benefit consists of a house,
garden, 50 stone of oat-meal, 2 or 3 pounds in money, his
fuel led home, liberty to plant 3 or 4 bushels of potatoes.
