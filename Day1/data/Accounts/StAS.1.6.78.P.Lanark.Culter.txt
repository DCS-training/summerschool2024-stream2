   The horses, which are generally bred here, or in the vici-
nity, are strong made, capable of enduring much fatigue, and 
have lately advanced in value.   A good many sheep and black-
cattle are sattened by the gentlemen, and some of the farmers,
who find a ready sale for them, purchasers appearing from La-
nark, Hamilton, and even from Glasgow.  Numbers are now
also sold into Biggar; where, for some time past, has been an
excellent market for butcher meat of all kinds.

   Stipend, School, and Poor.-The Stipend is L. 41:13:4
sterling, (including 50 merks Scotch for communion ele-
ments), 2 chalders of oatmeal, and 1 of bear.   The glebe
consists of 8 1/2 acres, and may be rated at L. 10.-Sir Charles
Ross of Balnagowan is patron.-The schoolmaster's salary
is L. 8:6:8, with a house and garden, and other emoluments,
amounting to about L. 5 more.  The collections at the church-
doors amount to about L. 8 per annum, a large sum, consider-
ing the small number of inhabitants, but owing chiefly to the
liberal offerings of some genteel families resident here.  This,
with the interst of L. 103, the capital of the poor's funds,
is distributed once a fortnight among the enrolled poor, who
are 7 in number; and part is employed in relieving the occa-
tional distresses of others, and in paying the fees of poor scho-
lars.  No beggars are to be seen in the parish.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The people are healthy, being
mostly employed in active occupations, and are sober and ex-
emplary.  Rheumatisms and colds are the most prevalent dis-
eases.-There are in the parish four encampments, all of
a cicular figure, called rings by the common people: likewise
