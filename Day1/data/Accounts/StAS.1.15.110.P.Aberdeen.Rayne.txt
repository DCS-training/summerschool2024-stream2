     NUMBER VII.

     PARISH OF RAYNE,

     (COUNTRY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, PRESBYTERY OF
     GARIOCH.)

     By the Rev Mr PATRICK DAVIDSON, Minister.

     Situation, Form, Extent and Surface.

   The parish of Rayne is situated in that district of the
county of Aberdeen, called Garioch, anciently Garvioch.  The
church, built in 1789, for 360 L. Sterling, lies 23 English
miles north from Aberdeen, and 9 from Inverury; and
the road from Aberdeen to Huntly passes through Old Rain,
a post town on the Southern extremity of the parish.  The
river Urie divides it on the S. W. from the parish of Oyne.
The figure of the parish is nearly a square, each side of which
is about two miles, and the church is very centrical.  There
is a hill upon the north side of the parish covered with heath
and hard weeds; and the rest of the parish is pretty flat,
with a few gently rising spots.
