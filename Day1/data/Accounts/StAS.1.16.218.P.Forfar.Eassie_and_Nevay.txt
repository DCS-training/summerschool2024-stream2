     Statistical Account

   Fuel.-Peats are found in the moss of Cookstown.  The
apprised value of every cart-load, together with the ex-
pence of digging, winning, and carrying it two or three
miles, may amount to 2 s. 6 d.  Three cart-loads for do-
mestic use are scarcely equal to one boll coals of 56 stones
avoirdupois weight, the price of which, including carriage
12 miles, is 9 s.  The scarcity and dearness of fuel have
induced many of the inferior class to leave this part of the
country.

   Plantations.-There are few trees in this district, hedge-
rows excepted.  On the estate of Dunkennie, a mile east-
ward of the church of Essie, a small thriving plantation of
Scoth fir diversifies the scene; and part of Sidla Hills was
planted by the late Earl of Strathmore.  A plantation of
forest-trees on a barren tract to the westward, would be
equally ornamental and useful.

   Houses.-There is no town nor village in Essie or Ne-
vay; for the cottages near the church of the latter do
not merit either of these appellations.  The farm-houses
and offices, with a few exceptions, are neatly built of sub-
stantial mason-work.  The dwelling-house consists of two
stories covered with state.  The huts of subtenants and me-
chanics have still a mean appearance, though more com-
fortable than at a preceding period.  The farmer's mode
of living is as much improved as his habitation.  His at-
tire is decent, his household-furniture not inelegant, and his
table plentifully stored.  In affluence he rivals the mid-
dling order of poprietors, and in hospitality excels them.

   Antiquities.-About a mile west of the church of Essie,
on the north side of the turnpike road through the Strath,
there is an ancient fortification, surrounded on the west,
south, and east sides, by a very deep and broad ditch, and
