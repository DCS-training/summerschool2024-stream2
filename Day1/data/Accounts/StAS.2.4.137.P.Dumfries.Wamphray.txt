			PARISH OF WAMPHRAY.

		PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

	          THE REV. CHARLES DICKSON, MINISTER.


		 I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

	Name, Boundaries, &c.--The ancient name of the parish was
Wamfry or Wamfray, which appears to have been derived from
the Scoto-Irish Uamh-fri, signifying the "den or deep glen in
the forest." Agreebly to this etymology, the site of the church
and old manse is in a deep and woody recess on the south side of
Wamfray Water. This water diveded the parish almost diagonally
from N. E. to S. W.; and in its winding course runs through a
romantic glen, which appears formerly to have been entirely co-
vered with wood. Nothing can conceived more romantic from the
bridge, about half a mile below the present manse, to about two
miles above it,--bounded as it is on both side by high steep
banks, still clad with young and very thriving woods; in some places,
barricadoed by shelving rocks of freestone, from which the water
oozes or flows from the neighbouring fields; in other, by lofty,
erect, basaltic columns, from the interstice of which may be seen
frequent saplings of ash, and the whole mantled over with ivy.
	The parish is bounded on the N. by Moffat; on the N. E. by
Eskdalemuir; on the E. by Hutton; on the S. by Applegarth;
on the W. to S. W. by Kirkpatrick-Juxta and Johnstone; from
which two latter parishes it is seperated by the river Annan. It
is on an oblong and nearly quadrilateral figure. The average ex-
tent of the parish in lenght is nearly 6 1/2 miles, and its breath
about 3 miles. In all, it contains about 19 square miles.
	Topographical Appearance.--There are two mountains-ranges
in the northern part of the parish, running parallel with the river
Annan, and with each other, from S. S. W. to N. N. E. and vary-
ing from 1000 to betwixt 2000 and 3000 feet in height. Besides
these, there are two ranges of hills nearer the south, and running
