gow, Leeds, and London.  There are about 170 looms,
which are wrought or superintended by about 60 master-
weavers; the number of apprentices is 18, and the rest of the
workmen are journeymen.  During their apprenticeship, or
stay in their master's houses as journeymen, they pay 2 s. a
week for board, and live wonderfully well.  The average
gross produce of a loom, including apprentices and old men
who do little work, is about L. 60 a year, (a good hand will
fetch considerably above L. 100); and the average gross ex-
pence to the master in liat, spinning, boiling, working, etc. is
about L. 46: 15:0, most of which is laid out in the parish
and near neighbourhood.  The looms find emploument for
women and children; and hence, a family being advanta-
geous, the men marry early; and hence one of the principal
causes of the increased population.  This manufacture circu-
lates above L. 10,000 annually; the greatest part of which is
brought into the parish, as all the work is performed by the in-
habitants; and the greatest part of the raw-material is home
produce.  Of the flax used, about 1/2 is Dutch, and 1/2 Riga;
the rest is the produce of Kettle.

   Agriculture, Produce, etc.-  The farms in the parish are 32,
and the average of servants on each is 5, viz. 3 men and 2
women.  Most of the farms have cottages, whence they
obtain assistance in hay-time and harvest.  Besides these,
there are many pendicles (pradiola), partly let off the farms,
and partly let immediately by the proprietor and a great
number of small feus, from 1 to 5 acres.  The farms are very
unequal, both in size and rent.  The rent of pasture grounds
is from 4 s. to L. 1:5:0, and of arable land from 5 s. to
L. 1: 11:6 an acre.  About a fourth part of the arable
ground is inclosed; and the advantages of inclosures is now
so universally acknowledge, that all new leases are let on in-
closing plans.  The sences are ditch and hedge, or stone-
