almost entirely abolished, which now prevails more than
ever; that is, the killing animals in the streets; a practice
contrary to law, most unwholesome, and highly offensive.
Considering that the place is so much resorted to edu-
cation, it is not merely a shame; it is criminal, to suffer
the youth to be daily shocked with, or hardened to the
dying agonies of animals, and to be obliged to wade in filth
and gore in passing along the streets.-The state of the
church too is a great disadvantage to the parish.  Besides its
ruinous condition, it is too small, and at too great a distance
from the populous towns, which are almost four fifths of
the whole.  It has been observed, that this place had the
advantage of an almost hourly communication with Edinburgh,
by means of fishwives, carriers of all sorts, and stage-
coaches, which rendered the conveyance of letters both
cheap and commodious.  Of late, of pretence of serving
the place, the General Post-office has extended a penny-
post over us, which turns out a real grievance.  Our cor-
respondents at Edinburgh pay a penny on putting in their
letters, and we have three halfpence to pay when they are
delivered here.  It is not believed, that there is such a piece
of extortion in any part of Great Britain.  In London, one
penny is all that is exacted.  This must appear doubly op-
pressive, when it is considered, that we are not allowed the
benefit of our situation, 6 miles eastward on the post-road to
London, but have our letters carried past us to Edinburgh,
and sent back at the additional charge of a penny per letter.
This is a real grievance, that deserves more attention than
all the imaginary ones, that have of late been so loudly complained
of.
