nothing but fuel and pasturage.  In other places, it is pretty
deep and hard, but, on account of the immense height and
steepness, it is susceptible of no cultivation.  The air is in
general moist.  This is occasioned by the height of the bills,
which continually attract the clouds, and the vapour that is
constantly exhaled by the fun from the mossy grounds.  It

through the parishes of Etterick, Yarrow, and Selkirk), it is
absorbed in the Tweed, some miles above Melrose.

   Sheep.-This parish produces no remarkable species of ani-
mals, except sheep, which are allowed by all to be delicious
food, and to thrive well, either when removed to the Eng-
lish pastures, or the Highland hills.  Nothing, however, can
