     of Kirkmichael.

   The annual average number of births is 26; of burials 18
or 19; and of marriages nearly 6; and each marriage pro-
duces, at an average, 5 children.  There are at present 60
persons between 50 and 70 years old; and 25 between 70
and 100.  One man in the parish is 103 years old.  His ac-
count of himself is, that he was born in the borrowing days*
of the year that King William came in, and that he was bap-
tised in bidlings, (i e. secretly), by a Presbyterian minister
the following summer, as the Curates were then in the kirks.
Though he is now mostly confined to bed, he retains his
mental faculties very distinct; and three years ago he wrought
at the harvest in perfect health and spirits.  A weaver who
died a few years ago, remembered his being several time
employed to ride King William's dragoon horses to water,
when they were going to Ireland before the battle at the 
Boyne.

   Occupation and Division of the Inhabitants.-There are 60
farmers; the average of persons in each family is fluc-
tuating and uncertain, being usually more in summer than
in winter; there are 4 blacksmiths; 4 carpenters; 3 mil-
lers; 4 shoemakers; 6 taylors; 16 weavers; 3 clogmakers;
3 little merchants; 1 surgeon, an old man.  No nobility or
gentry reside in the parish.  There are three small villages
in the parish; the largest consisting of 100 souls, and each of
the other two of about 70 or 75.  They live on three large
corn farms, on which, with their own industry, they subsist
pretty comfortably.  The people, in general, are occonomical
and industrious.  Very few of them have gone into either
the army or navy these many years.  They enjoy, in a rea-
sonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society, and
