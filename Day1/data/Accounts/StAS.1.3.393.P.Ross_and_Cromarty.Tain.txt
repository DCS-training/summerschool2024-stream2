     of Tain.

   Price of Provisions.-Beef, mutton, veal, pork, butter, and
cheese, are imported, and the prices of them double of what
they were 40, or even 30 years ago.  Butcher meat sells from
2 d. to 3 d. sometimes higher, per pound; butter, from 10 s.
to 12 s. per strone; cheese, from 4 s. to 6 s.; hens, cocks, and
ducks, from 3 d. to 6 d. each.  There is less variation in the
prices of victual.  Barley and oat meal sell now from 14 s.
to 16 s. and have been generally at the same rates for the last
seven years, and indeed from 1770 to 1780.  Twelve shillings
is reckoned no bad contract price for 7 or more years; the
highest given is 13 s. 4 d.  About 40 years ago, fish were
plentiful and cheap; but now they are scarce, and advanced
in the price.

   Language.-The inhabitants of the town speak the Eng-
lish, and also the Gaelic or Erse.  Both languages are preach-
ed in the church.  Few of the older people, in the country
part of the parish, understand the English language; but the
children are now generally sent to school, and taught to read
English.  The names of places are, partly Scottish, partly Gae-
lic; some expressive of the local situation, as being on an
eminence, or in a hollow,or on a muir; by the wood, or by
the water side; and some indicating the names of antient
possessors.

   Rent-The land rent is about 1200 bolls, and 800 L.  Ster-
ling.  The rent of houses in the town is about 650 L. Ster-
ling.

   Stipend, etc.-The benesice is 120 bolls of victual, half
barley, half oat meal, with 4 L. 15 L.  Sterling, as fixed in
1718; besides a glebe, manse, and garden, worth abouth 12 L.
per annum.  There are 15 heritors in the parish.  the Crown
