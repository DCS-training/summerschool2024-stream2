white saugh grows to a considerable size.  It will grow to the

is peculiarly useful for farming utensils and machinery.

   Cattle and Carriages.-The number of horses is supposed
to be about 360, of which the greater part has been reared in
the parish.-The number of cows is about 1600; about 180
or 200 are annually bought and sold; the remainder consists

the vicinity of Stirling.  Seldom does the seed labour begin
before the middle of March, and not unfrequently the end of
