     Of Fenwick.

   Rivulets, Surfaces, Fuel, &c.-Two considerable ri-
vulets, or waters, as they are called here, run through
the parish from E. to W.  Both have their sources in
the moor-grounds towards Eaglesham.  They unite a 
little below Crawfordland Castle, in the parish of Kil-
marnock, run through that town before it joins the
water of Irvine, and at Irvine are emptied into the sea.
They abound with trouts, and afford entertainment to
those who are fond of fishing; and would be still more
plentiful, were they not greatly destroyed in the dry
months by the hand.  Salmon never come this way;
which is owing, probably, to the waters being render-
ed hurtful to them by the works carried on in Kilmar-
nock.  They very seldom do any harm to either grass
or corn.  On their banks, there is not a bush.-This
parish, though high above the level of the sea, is not
mountainous.  To look at Fenwick, from Craigie hills
in Kyle, it appears a large plain.  The accent from Kil-
marnock, Kilmaurs and Dreghorn, is very gradual.  At
many spots, almost indeed from every farm and every
house, the prospect is most extensive towards Kyle,
Carrick, the Frith of Clyde, and the Island of Arran,
with the tops of the hills in Argyleshire.  From the 2
waters already mentioned, the lands have a N. or a S.
exposure.  The surface is green, and produces tolerable
grass.  Though in some places there are large propor-
tions of black heath, where the peats are cut, or grounds
covered with heath and bent.  The most common fuel
is peat.  What coal is made use of is brought from
London, from Kilkmarnock, and from Kilmaurs, at
the distance of about 5 miles from the church, and ra-
ther to more above it.  In the farmers houses, very
few coals are used.  Formerly every trademan had his
