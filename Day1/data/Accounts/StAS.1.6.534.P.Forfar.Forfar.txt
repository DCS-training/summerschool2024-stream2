     Statistical Account

there is an addition of near 1000 inhabitants to the town.  The
chief causes of this increase have been already pointed out.
   The inhabitants of both town and country share alike the
praise of industry, economy, and hospitality.  If sewer instances
of intemperance, impurity, and prodigality appear in the coun-
try than in the town in proportion to the number in each, it is
perhaps chiefly, because simplicity of manners is less liable to
corruption in the former than in the latter, from a multiplicity
of low ale-houses, these seminaries of impiety and dissipation.-
The farmers and manufactures in the former, however, have
experienced a change in their dress and expenditure as percep-
tible as what has taken place among the inhabitants of the
burgh.
   The parishioners are in general attached to the religious e-
stablishment of the kingdom.  A small society of Episcopalians
and another of Seceders form the sum of the sectaries.-A spi-
rit of enquiry and a taste for reading is springing up, and po-
pular superstitions begin to hide their heads.  The sub-
scriptions to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Bee, and several
periodical and other publications, scientific, religious, moral
and political, are more numerous of late than could well have
been expected; and they already shed an evident lustre on the
conversation of many.
   The presbytery of Forfar was disjoined from Dundee by an
act of the provincial synod of Angus and Mearns, dated Ar-
broath, 17th April 1717, and the members held their first
meeting by appointment at Forfar on 1st May following.
   The stipend, as augmented in 1785, is L. 84: 15: 9 d 3/15 in
money, and 31 bolls 2 pecks of meal, making, at the ordinary
coversion, L. 100 neat, L. 5 for communion element money,
with a house and garden, and a glebe consisting of about 7 a-
cres.-The new church was opened for public worship on the
9th day of January 1791.-The oldest date upon the manse
is 1619.
