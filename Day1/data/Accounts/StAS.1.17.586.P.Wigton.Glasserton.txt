the barn, in shocks only.  Large quantities of both potatoes
and grain are annually exported.  Sometimes the course of
crops, above described, is so far deviated from, that, after the
third crop of grain, the field is manured with dung, and
planted with potatoes or turnips; after which it is, on the
fifth year, sown with barley and grass seeds.  After the reap-
ing of the barley, the field is left to enjoy the usual period of
cessation from tillage.

   Sheep.-Sheep are the third in importance of the articles
of the stock and produce of the farms in this parish.  The
small white-faced race of the parish of Mochrum; the well
known, small, black-faced breed of Galloway; the variety
produced by the skilful management of the celebrated Culley;
the Spanish and the Shetland races of sheep, are all known
and fed here.  A mixture of the black-faced Galloway, with
the Culley breed, has been also tried.  But the common
Galloway race is the most prevalent.  Neither the Spanish
nor the Shetland sheep has, as yet, been found to thrive here,
in such a manner as might encourage the common farmer to
receive them into his flocks.  The practice of smearing the
shees, annually, at the beginning of winter, with butter and
tar, has begun to fall into disuse; because the ordinary tempe-
rature of winter on these coasts, is extremely mild; and the
quality of the wool of sheep unsmeared is, for the most part,
considerably better, than the quality of that which is clotted
with tar.  The finest wool is sold to the merchants at the
price of 16 s. a stone.  Those lambs which can be annually
spared for sale, are sold at the average rate of about 6 L. Ster-
ling a seore.  Sheep of the age of 3 or 4 four years, are
bought from this parish, for the market, at the rate of 10 L.
or 12 L. a score.  In some instances, sheep of that age, have
been sold here, at above a guinea a head.
