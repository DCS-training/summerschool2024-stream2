three stories high, with battlements on the top; said to have
been built by a gentlemen of the name of Edward Irvine, evi-
dently for a place of safety against the depredations of the
English boarderers.-The stone in which a wooden cross for-
merly stood, also, still remains:  It was called St. Marjory's
cross, to whom, tradition says, the church itself was dedicated.
-The names of places seem mostly derived fromthe An-
glo-Saxon, or old English, as Butterdale, Todholes, etc.
and some may be derived from the Erse, as Robgill, Gillfoot
etc.-The language spoken here is the English, or lowland
Scots; but from the intercourse with Cumberland, a little of
that dialect, is naturally imbided.

   Population.-The population of this parish is rather on the
decline, owing, perhaps, to the increasing manufactures in
our neighbourhood, particularly Carlisle and Annan, which
has induced some of the people, to go and settle there; and
partly to the accumulation of many possessions into one; seve-
ral instances of which have lately happened.  Some young
people also go into England, as servants, for higher wages,
and some as itinerant merchants or pedlars.  By the exami-
nation roll taken about six or seven years ago, this parish con-
tained 780 inhabitants; and about eight or ten years before
that, nearly the same number; but by the roll taken in March,
1790, there were only 738 then living, so that the decrease a-
mounts to 42.  The number, however, in 1755, according to
Dr Webster, was only 716.
