	In 1791, when the total population was 1288, more than one-
half, viz. 677, resided in villages, and 611 in the country. At
present, 1966 live in villages, and 731 in the country. There are
employed in coal pits, 100; in the quarries, 8. The increase of
396 between 1821 and 1831, is chiefly owing to the proximity of
the parish to Glasgow, and to the large proportion of persons em-
ployed in manufactures and coal-pits, most of whom marry early,
and generally rear large families. There are about 600 weavers,
including females. There are 65 names on the roll of electors,
44 of whom voted at last election for Mr Maxwell, the Whig can-
didate; 5 for Mr Lockhart, the Tory candidate; and 5 did not
come to the poll.
	A register of births and proclamations, and also a register of
burials has been kept with great accuracy. The following is the
gross amount of each, with the average number for the last seven
years:

	There thus appears to be one baptism per annum to 39 persons
nearly, one burial to 51, and one marriage to 99. The propor-
tion of marriages here is very great; in England it is 120, and in
Wales 136. There are 253 children for 100 marriages, which
makes about 2 1/2 children for each marriage. Hence every 20 have
about 50 children. Perhaps four-tenths do not marry, which will
make a proportional increase in the number of children born of
each marriage. In 1791, when last report was drawn up, the po-
pulation was 1288; in 1836 it is 2705, which is 129 more than
doubled. The births between 1720 and 1728 inclusive were 123,
which, if taken at the same ratio as at present, would give a popu-
lation of only 693. The following tables contain a classified ar-
rangement of ihe inhabitants in 1791 and 1836, from authentic
sources:
