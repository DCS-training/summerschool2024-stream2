dition, would in all probability have placed both the owners and
the occupiers of the soil, with many others who depend upon them,
directly or indirectly, in a new and perilous situation.  Tenants
ordinarily are not possessed of much capital beyond what they have
invested in stocking and improving their tenements, to enable them
to bear up under a heavy and protracted pressure; and unless
their rents could be so adjusted by reference to the current prices
of what their farms chiefly yield, so as to rise and fall with the
fluctuations in the value of produce, there is a risk of a series of
cross seasons obliging them to relinquish their places and voca-
tions; and if this should ever unfortunately, be the case, to any
considerable extent, it may be difficult to find another set of men
possessed of capital, skill, and enterprise to succeed them. It
would, therefore, be wise in landlords and tenants to make such
arrangements with one another, as may enable them to meet, so
far as a prudent foresight can avail, without any serious shock,
this, to say the least of it, not very improbable contingency. Ad-
verting to the ordinary course of seasons and events, and taking,
moreover, into account, how the agricultural, like other great na-
tional pursuits is liable to be affected by the unsettled and restless
state of legislation, which has for some time perplexed and discon-
certed many classes of the community, we have no right to pre-
sume on a lasting continuance of even such prosperity as that with
which the country has been for some time providentially favoured.
Besides such clauses in leases as those to which I have just refer-
red, it would be politic, as well as just in land-owners, to encourage
their tenantry, by assisting them to execute all substantial and
costly improvements wanted, such as roads, water-courses, ditches,
drains, fences, &c. because they thereby put them into a better
state for settling with themselves at term time, and, happen what
may, provided the occupier pays a due proportion of the expense,
these improvements, if judiciously planned and properly executed,
must add, beyond what they have cost them, to the value of their
property.  Indeed, it properly belongs to the proprietor who either
has of himself, or by concert with his neighbours, may get the
command of a district, to project and execute many improvements,
which, in order to be effectual, require to be extended over a wider
space than the limits of a single tenement.  Farms, commencing
with such as occupy a pair of horses, and are in the hands of one
individual, vary in size from 30 to 500 acres.  There are about
five score of tenements that can be managed with greater or less
