     Statiscal Account

   Goats, Game, etc.-There are some goats in the parish
that pasture the east side, belonging to some gentlemen,
but they are few in number, and of no consequence; there
is some deer and rabbits, which are preserved by the pro-
preitors.  The parish abounds in game of the aquatic
species, of every kind to be seen in the Hebrides, namely,
swans, wild-geese, herons, cormorants, ducks, teals, so-
lon-geese, and curlews.  Game, to be found in the moun-
tains, are, moor or heath-fowls, woodrocks, and pigeons,
carnivorous birds in great numbers, such as, eagles, hawk,
falcons, ravens, and grey crows, in all seasons of the
year.

   Fisheries, etc.-There is no trade or manufacturers car-
ried on in the parish, either in the importation or exporta-
tion line, only the kelp and black cattle, mentioned above.
It is very certain, that the coasts of the parish, both to-
wards the east and west side of it, abound with every spe-
cies of fish, to be found in the Herbrides; such as, her-
rings, ling, cod, mackerel, turbot, skate, and flounder,
besides the greatest variety of shell-fish, viz. lobsters,
crabs, cockles. oysters, muscles, and spout-fish.  There are
numbers of whales, seen at all seasons of the year, on the
coasts of the parish; but the fisherman, as yet, do not un-
derstand the proper method of harpooning them, as the
whales do not remain above the surface of the sea for any
length of time.  The sail fish, or barking shark, appears on
the coasts of the parish early in the month of May, if the sea-
son is warm; he is a stupid and torpid kind of fish; he allows
the haponeer often to feel him with his hand, before he
darts at him.  The inhabitants to the east side of the island,
(such as are able to fit out boats, lines, and harpoons,) have
been for some years very succesful during the summer
