   Produce, etc.-Potatoes are raised for family use, and a
few garden and field turnip, principally for the same pur-
pose.  Natural oaks, birch and allar, apple, pear, plum,
gean and cherry trees grow in several places, and some large
inclosures of planted firs, of a pretty old standing, large
enough for deals, farm-houses couples, etc.
   Barley, rye, and oats, ar raised in the parish.  Very lit-
tle flax is cultivated, and a few fields are laid down in grass.
   Ever since the present incumbent was settled, (1778,) un-
less in a few instances, the crops have been found insufficient
to maintain the inhabitants or their cattle.  Living, how-
ever, in the vicinity of Elgyn and Forres, they are em-
ployed in carrying peats twice a-week to market.  This
enables them to purchase some additional provisions for
their families, and also corn, or corn and sodder in the
season, when a deficiency at home requires a supply.  Sow-
ing does not become general till towards the middle of
April.  The climate admits not of it earlier:  And the
tenants, doubtless, owing to the soil, think
they have the cleaner crop the later sown.  Of course,
it is the middle or rather the end of November before
all the corns are got in.  From 1 s. to 15 s. may be
the rent of each acre, from the least improved miur to the
highest cultivated field.  Every parish in the north of
Scotland, doubtless, suffered by the failure of crop 1782;
among which, it may be conceived, this parish had its me-
lancholy share.  A liberal share of bounty-meal was, at that
period, allowed for the indigent in the parish.  The first
and second moieties, gratis, came most seasonably in sum-
mer 1783, or before the corns were ripe.  The third and
last moiety from Government, at 6 1/2 d. a peck, came also
seasonably a short time thereafter.
