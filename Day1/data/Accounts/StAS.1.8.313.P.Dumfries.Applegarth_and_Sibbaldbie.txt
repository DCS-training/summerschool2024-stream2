since the sowing of barley was introduced into the parish.  Bear,
which still mostly prevails, was universally sown.  Few of
the farms are inclosed.  It would be a very great improvement
to this part of the country, and of advantage to the farmers,
if their farms were all inclosed, and subdivided with dykes,
and hedges.  The hedges would thrive exceedingly well, as
the soil, in general, is good, and where they have been plant-
ed, they have thriven well.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The farmers and the parishion-
ers in general, are laborious and industrious, and commonly
very healthy.  Fevers, or any epidemical disorders, seldom pre-
vail in the parish, except the small pox, which carries off se-
veral of the children.  Most of the country people still entertain
strong prejudices against inoculation, though not so great as
formerly; for several have been lately prevailed on to get
their children inoculated, and there instances have always
been attended with remarkable success.-Many of the natives
live to a good age.  There were, some time ago, in the
church, in one day, three old men, whole ages amounted to
270.  Several of them live to the age of 80 or 90, but few
or none to 100.-There are no villages in the parish, nor ma-
nufactures of any kind carried on, except by a few weavers,
who are chiefly employed by the inhabitants.
