loose and unguarded; subject to bondage in harvest and a
certain number of carriages; and, as the clay of this parish
was then in exceeding bad order, lime was give by the
proprietor to most of them, and a small rent in mo-
ney required for some years; after which their rent was
partly in wheat, barley and meal, deliverable between
Christmas and Candlemas; partly in money, either pay-
able at Whitsunday, or one-half then and one-half at Lam-
mas or at Martinmas.  Liferent tacks were then not un-
common; and they sometimes extended to two or three
lives.  In some tacks (leases) a very extraordinary clause
was introduced; the tenant had leave to name any life he
pleased during his tack (lease), upon which his possession
was to continue.

   Tacks or Leases now.-At this day, there is no thirlage;
there is no bondage in harvest; nor are the tenants bound to
days work in planting, etc.  They pay their rents in mo-
ney and victual only.  They are not bound to go messsages;
and they only are bound to carry with their horses and
carts, a certain proportion of coals for the proprietors family,
if they reside; which is exceedingly moderate, and some
carts for lime, etc. which is seldom demanded; but it is ex-
pressly provided, that they shall not be demanded either in
seed-time, or harvest.

   Divisions into Sixes.-In 1775, or thereabouts, the prac-
tice of dividing the carse farms into fixes, became pretty ge-
neral and it became a clause in most tacks (leases), to have
1-6th of the farm in fallow, 1-6th in wheat, 1-6th in beans
or pease, 1-6th in barley, 1-6th in clover, and 1-6th in oats;
which practice is said to have been introduced by the late
Hendry Crawford of Monorgan, Esq; and it has been conti-
nued in the clay by the best farmers ever since.  Sometime
