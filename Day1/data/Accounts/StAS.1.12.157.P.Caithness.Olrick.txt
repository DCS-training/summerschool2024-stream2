hills, form themselves into the shape of three extended amphi-
theatres, intersected by a multiplicity of vallies and rivulets, 
affording the most luxuriant pasturage for cattle in the sum-
mer months, and natural hay for their support in winter.
Towards the sea, the whole is one continued track of rich
cultivated soil.  Moss is not very abundant in the parish;
and the want of good peat-fuel may be reckoned one of the 
greatest inconveniences which the inhabitants labour under.
Along the sea-coast, and towards the rising grounds, the air 
is pure and healthy; but from the swamps abounding in the 
hollows, and the infalubrious vapours they emit, all the com-
plaints arising from obstructed perspiration, are not unfrequent
among the inhabitants.  It is much to be regretted, that great-
er exertions are not made for the draining of these marshes;
for, independent of the influence of such operations in melior-
ating the air and climate and thereby consulting the health of 
the people, the marl to be found in them for the purposes of 
agriculture, would amply compensate the expense of the work. 
The loch of Duran, in particular, calls for an exertion of this 
fort; it is the only one in the parish, and is nearly 3 miles in 
circumference; a part of it was drained some years ago, by a 
former proprietor, and bog-hay, as it is called, now grows
in great abundance, where pool and putrefaction heretofore 
prevailed.  The outlet to the sea is of easy operation; and by
continued exertions, it is not to be doubted but this expanse
of water might, in a few years, be ruduced to a small rivulet,
and the soil it now occupies rendered as productive as any
part of the parish.

   Soil and Produce.-The soil, in general along the coast,
and in the flat parts of the parish, is a deep clay, with here 
and there a little intermixture of sand and till.  Remote from
the coast, the soil is lighter, and less productive, and more cal-
