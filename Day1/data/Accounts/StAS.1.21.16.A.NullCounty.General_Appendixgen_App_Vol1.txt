of inhabitants on this side of the border at large during the
period here referred to.  But I believe it is not the cause of
the late great depopulation.  The emigration from either side
seems to be mutual.  It is somewhat remarkable that several
of the shepherds, and some of the most substantial farmers in
the parish have come over to reside here from the English
side.  This however does not in general happen in other pa-
rishes; and I know not in a any instance, that an individual
from the Scottish side, has emigrated to England, (I mean in
this district of parishes,) and settled there as a resident farmer,
although many rent small farms in England, which often suit
well for raising young sheep, to be afterwards laid on the large
farms here.
   The number of deaths in the parish is to the births as 4
to 12: there must be an increase therefore, at least, of 8
souls every year to the parish.  This would soon occasion a con-
siderable surplus of inhabitants more than could be accom-
modated with houses, or with the means of life: they there-
fore must separate and disperse annually in all directions;
some to the towns and villages of the neighbourhood, some
to England, where servants wages are rather higher than in
Scotland, and some to America and the Indies.
   The great and most obvious cause of the decrease of the
inhabitants, within the last thirty or forty years, is owing
to the (perhaps too general) practice of letting the lands in
great farms, and to the mode of agriculture now almost
universally adopted, especially since sheep and wool brought
so high a price, of laying down the whole lands in grass.
The lands formerly, from 40 to 100 years back, were par-
celled out into four times, at least, the present number of
farms: there was also much of these farms in village: and
consequently a greater number of people could be main-
tained, and more hands would be necessary for carrying on
