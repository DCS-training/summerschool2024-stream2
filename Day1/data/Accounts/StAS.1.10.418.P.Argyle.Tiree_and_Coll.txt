     Statistical Account

out the trouble of an act of Parliament.  Humanity will feel
for our dismal situation without a Surgeon.  The want of a
proper mill is a heavy grievance, and the loss of several hun-
dred pounds Sterling.  We are in great need of markets, and
easier communication with towns; and also of a village and
manufactures within ourselves, to occupy our superfluous
hands.  We need much a change of seed, introducing of
green crops, inclosing, draining, and subdividing small farms.
How can we improve our farms without tradesmen, carts,
a better breed of horses to expedite our labour, and ba-
nishing so many hundred weak horses, to rear black cattle in
their place?  We spend the best season of the year, which
should be otherwise usefully employed, in providing fuel, in
ruining the face of our farms; while there is such an unequal
duty upon coals, and yet we must soon buy them at what-
ever price*.  Our loyal and vigorous youth are ready, at a
call, to serve their King and country; and if any place in
Scotland can claim a preference, in an exemption from the
coal duty, it is this Atlantic Isle.
