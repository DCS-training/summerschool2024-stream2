rewarding the labour and expence , his example was soon
followed; and now, both sides of the Ken are enriched
by it; and besides, the grain arising from this mode of 
cultivation, he has the satisfaction of having inspired his
people with a spirit of industry; and now, when marl
cannot be conveniently got, they have recourse to lime,
and find that it pays them very well.  There is no marl
in Galloway beyond 10 miles from the sea.  Here we are
24 miles distant.  The cultivation by marl is principally
owing to the exertions of Mr Gordon of Greenlaw, a very
public spirited gentleman, the sherriff of the county, who
not only encouraged the draining of the Carlingwork
Loch, where there are immense beds of shell-marl, but at his
own expence made a canal 3 miles in lenght, to hoin Loch
Dee, and constructed a number of flat bottomed boats of
different dimensions, to carry the marl from the Carling-
work Loch up the Dee and Ken to this place; some of
which carry 20 double cart load, at 20 feet square to the
cart load, or 400 solid feet of marl.-There are upwards
of 500 acres of natural wood in different spots in this pa-
rish, consisting mostly of oak, ash, birch, alder, hazel.
These woods have been mostly cut within these 25
years, and the young plants are in a thriving state.
Much old fir is in the parish.  Many acres of young fir
were lately planted.  About 80 acres in lochs, besides
Loch Ken.  There has been a large forest in the north end
of this parish; two large farms still retain the name of
Upper and Nether Forest, and a large flat of meadow
called the King's Holm.  This forest has been anciently
stocked with deer; several of them were running wild on
our moors about 20 years ago.  Some old people remem-
ber to have seen near 20 of them.  Since that time, their
number has gradually decreased; the last of them was
killed 7 or 8 years ago.  Deer were plenty on the hills
