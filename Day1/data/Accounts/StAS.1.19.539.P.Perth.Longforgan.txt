which is undermost neither sees sun nor feels air, while the
upper part is blenched with both; and, of course, as it must
remain much longer in the field before the under part is
win, the upper part is lost; and also, it will be much longer
exposed to accidents, from unfavourable weather; the prac-
tice, therefore, is bad, and the method above recommended
in every sense preferable.

   Timothy Grass.-Timothy grass has also been tried in
this parish; but it yielded a coarse vegetable, by no means
to be compared with the rye-grass upon the same field, and
while the last remained, the Timothy was thrown out in
the winter, and left nothing but bunches scattered through
the field*.

*Cattle, as well as every other species of bestial upon the farm, are fed
upon clover in the house, besides then pasture during the greatest part
of the summer; but great care should be taken not to give it to them,
while wet with rain, or to suffer cattle or cows to pasture upon young clo-
ver while the morning dews remain upon the ground.  For it is well
known, that not only clover, but other succulent vegetables, when ate by
cattle in that state, are apt to produce such a sudden, and violent fermenta-
tion in the stomach, as to end in fatal consequences, if not timeously pre-
vented.

Thus disease is evidently produced by an extraordinary and sudden disten-
tion of the stomach, from an immense quantity of fixed an let loose by the
fermentation of those succulent vegetables; and as, from the nature and
structure of this viscus, the more it is extended, the less capable it is to dis-
charge any of its contents, of course, if not speedily relieved, the
disease increases, until a rupture of the stomach takes place, and death
ensues.

If soon observed, by an apparent swelling and elevation on the near side,
not far from the spine, gentle exercise, by walking the animal about, very
frequently, effects the cure; probably by assisting the peristaltic motion of
the guts, and promoting a discharge of wind and foeces per ano, which is
the first favourable symptom of the disease going off.  To aid this, many
remedies have been thought of and proposed; and amongst others, a pound
of sweet butter, melted and mixed with Ol. Anifi or Ol. Jumpiris, from one
