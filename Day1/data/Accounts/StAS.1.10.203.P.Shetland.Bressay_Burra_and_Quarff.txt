   Few years pass in which ships are not cast away upon these
dangerous coasts.  Sailors unacquainted with the coast, espe-
cially in thick weather, and in dark nights, are ready to
mistake the opening between the islands of Bressay and Noss
for the entrance to Bressay Sound, and, if they come too
near the rocks, are in danger of being dashed to pieces.  A
light upon Noss Head, which would be seen at a great dis-
tance, might prevent such disasters.  It could be erected at
no great expence.  This matter certainly deserves the atten-
tion of Government.
   The people here are all Presbyterians of the established
Church of Scotland.  Their language is the same with that
of the inhabitants of North Britain.  The names of places
are derived from the Danish and Norwegian languages, and
are said to be very expressive of the situation.

opposite side.  Ropes are stretched across, from the one side to
the other, upon which a wooden cradle slides along, and af-
fords a safe conveyance between the island and the holm.  The
man who first ascended the rock, would not take the benefit of
returning in the cradle, but, attempting to return the same
way he went up, fell, and was unfortunately killed.  The re-
ward which he was to have received from the laird, had he
come back safe, was a horse, cow, sheep, etc.  Sheep are now
annually put into the holm in the beginning of the season, and
taken out in autumn in excellent condition.  Many of the sea-
fowl which breed here are fine delicate eating.
