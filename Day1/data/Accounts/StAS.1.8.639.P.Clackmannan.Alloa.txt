CATHCART's valuation is very small, his principal property
lying in the parish of Clackmannan; but his house and plea-
sure grounds are in this parish, and he frequently resides
among us.  We are always much indebted to his Lordship,
for his advice and assistance when in the country.  Lord ALVA,
residing always out of the parish, gives us only the benefit
of a ready and cheerful concurrence, with every measure pro-
posed by the residing heritors.  All these gentlemen hold con-
siderable property in other parishes.  The valued rent is
7,492 L. 19 s. 2 d. Scotch.  The real rent is probably about
4,000 L. Sterling.

   Police.-The good of the place, and the administration of jus-

the sheriff-depute.  There is only one sheriff-depute for this
and the neighbouring county of Stirling.  He appoints his
substitutes; and one constantly resides here, who keeps his
courts in this town.  The quarter sessions, and other meetings
of form, either by the justices of the peace, or sheriff, are held
in the county town of Clackmannan, about 2 miles distant.
There is a baron bailie, named by the proprietor of the estate
of Marr.  He decides on petty offences, and debts not exceed-
ing 40 s.; and regulates the gents and cesses, and other matters
of police within the town and barony.-An admiral court was
formerly kept here, in virtue of a commission from the Lord
Vice Admiral of Scotland.  The jurisdiction of this court
extended from the bridge of Stirling to Pettycur, near King-
horn, on the north side of the Forth, and from Stirling Bridge
to Higgin's Neuck on the south.  For some time past, no de-
putation has been granted, and of course no court kept.  The
want of an admiral court has been complained of, as a very
material grievance.  For want of this, every little trisling
dispute, which happens at the port, must be carried before the
