     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   THE name of the parish is Strathswordle, but for the
sake of brevity it is called Strath, which is Gaelic,
and signifies a valley; but swordle has no affinity to the

Inverness, presbytery of Sky, and Synod of Glenelg.  The
form of the parish is very irregular.  Its length is about
13 Scotch miles, and its greatest breadth 3 1/2 miles.  It is
