     NUMBER XVII.

     PARISH OF SLAINS,

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER FARQUHAR.

     Name, Extent, Surface, and Soil.

   THE name of this parish, to which that of Forvie is
now united, has been SLAINS, as far back as can be
traced.  Slains is said to signify health in the Gaelic lan-
guage; and indeed the singular healthiness of the inhabi-
tants in general, renders it not improbable, that the
place has at first been so denominated on account of the ex-
cellence of its climate*.  It belongs to the presbytery of
Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen.  It is between 5 and 6
English miles in length, about 3 in breadth, and in form a
sort of triangle +.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Two women died here lately, the one in the 101 ft year of her age,
the other in the 102 d.  There is one alive just now, in her 91st year, en-
joying all her senses; only she is a little dull in hearings, but healthy and
humorous.  There are several others a very little younger

+There is an accurate map of Captain Gordon's estate in his own pos-
session, and also one of the rest of the parish, in the hands of Mr John
Wauchope, writer to the Signet, or of the heirs of Major Callander
of Crighton.
