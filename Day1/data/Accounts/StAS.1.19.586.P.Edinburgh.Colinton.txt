numbers, however, continued rather on the increase till the
time of the seven years famine, that is, from the year 1695
to the year 1702, during which period they are said to
have been much diminished.  From the year 1703, the
numbers did again increase, till about the year 1720.  At
that time, they were again reduced by the establishment of
larger farms, and continued for many years stationary.  But
by the increase of the metropolis and of manufacturers, the
parish has again, for a considerable time, been advancing
in population.  There are no uninhabited houses in it.  If
any are demolished, it is but in order to their being rebuilt;
and every year there are new ones erected, which are im-
mediately filled with inhabitants.
   In an information presented to the Court of Teinds in
the year 1709, this parish was said to contain 318 examin-
able persons.  If to these a fourth of unexaminable persons
be added, the whole inhabitants amounted to 397.  From
a record in possession of the church, it appears, that about
the year 1750, the whole inhabitants of the parish amount-
ed to 782.  In Dr Webster's Report, anno 1755, the num-
ber is stated at 792.
   At present, the number of inhabited houses in the parish
is exactly 313; and the number of inhabitants is 1395
nearly; which, to a trifle, allots 4 1/2 inhabitants to each
house.
   If the extent of the parish, as is computed, amounts to
5070 acres, and the number of people is 1395, it contains
between 3 and 4 acres for each inhabitant.  This is a very
great degree of population, compared to the extent of land;
especially as there are upwards of 1600 acres of sheep-walk,
and other grounds, which do not occupy 40 people.  But
the greater part of the inhabitants are supported by manu-
factures, and by various occupations, independent of the
soil.
