high estimation in this place. He was born in 1686, and died in
1758. He was a man of singular humility, benevolence, and
piety, spending much of his time in divine meditations, which he
was in the habit of committing to writing, "top keep, his heart from
wandering, and fix it upon divine and spiritual subjects." A
small selection from these meditations was published after his
death, and forms a composition remarkable for the regularity of
its structure, at the for the simplicity, spirituality, and fervour of its
devotional sentiments. *
		      III.-POPULATION.
   Kinneil was a considerable town long before any population had
collected at the Ness. In the year 1661, there were 559 "com-
murricable" persons in the parish of Kinneil, the greater part of
whom resided in the town of Kinneil. Probably the increase of
trade at the Ness, and other causes, withdrew the population from
the town of Kinneil; so that in 1691, it was almost wholly demo-
Jisbed; a few families only remained. But the great improve-
ments in agriculture, since the middle of the eighteenth century,
have in some measure restored the population of the barony, al-
though the town of Kinneil has wholly disappeared.

   The town of Bo'ness, notwithstanding its unpromising external
appearance, is remarkable for the healthiness and longevity of the
inhabitants. By a table, constructed with much care from the
register of deaths for a period of twenty-five years immediately
preceding 1834, it appears that the number of deaths was 1342;
that during that time, 167 persons died between 60 and 70 years
of age; 227, between 70 and 80; 119, between 80 and 90; and
11, upwards of 90.

<FOOTNOTE>The following notices refer to the commotions in 1745. Instructions and war-
rants were sent on different occasions, through the Custom-House here, to the She-
riff of Linlithgow, the Magistrates of South Queensferry, and "the baillie of this
town," regarding suspected persons and ships.
   The Custom-House was robbed by the rebels, who carried off a number of broad-
sword baleds, cutlasses, &c, which formed part of a shipment from Germany, made
by an armourer in Glasgow, on a Treasury warrant.
   A troop of dragons, brought to protect Kinneil House, accidentally set fire to
some of the seats which remained in the old chruch Kinneil. Kinneil House
had, on forler occasions, been exposed to violence. In December 1559, during
popular commotions, it was pillaged, and in February following it was  burned; and
again it was burned, in 1570, by of the English army who had invaded Scot-
land.
