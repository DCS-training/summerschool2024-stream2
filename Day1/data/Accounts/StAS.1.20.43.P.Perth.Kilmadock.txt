earse on the banks of Forth; the whole forming a ridge,
running from north-west to south-east, and extending along
the lands of Lochfield, the house of Gartincaber, etc. where
the soil is coldest, and most barren, growing warmer and
richer on each side, as the grounds decline towards Teith on
the north; and the Carse of Forth on the south.  When an-
cient Caledonia was covered with woods, the wood along
this ridge would be called, the grove ont he hill-side, which,
in Gaelic, is Garran-cabbar; and hence the present name,
Gartincaber.
   The lands of Newton and Row are in the same form of
a ridge, and hence exhibit various degrees; and as the
grounds on the north banks of Teith rise, gradually, to a
considerable height, the soil, though of one general quality,
grows colder, and more barren, as the rise increases, the up-
per farms being far inferior in fertility to those on the river
side.
   The produce, like the soil, is various, viz. wheat, rye,
oats, barley, beans, peas, clover, rye-grass, and flax.  The
soil is also friendly to all kinds of roots, particularly the po-
tatoe, and turnip, which grow in great abundance and per-
fection.
   Mr Dougla Balfour, a skilful farmer, in the year 1784,
sowed 3 bolls fo red oats, at Callichat, which produced no
less than 48 bolls, yielding an equal quantity of meal.
   There is no wheat raised, except in the carses on the
banks of Forth; though the most of the lands on the south
side of Teith, as well as the Rows, and Newton, are capable
of producing it.  A potatoe crop it accounted better husban-
dry, where the grounds are free and dry.  This root en-
riches the land, in place of exhausting it, like wheat; and
when the crop is drilled, so as to admit horse-hoeing, it is
equal to a fallow.  The potatoe is succeeded by a crop of
