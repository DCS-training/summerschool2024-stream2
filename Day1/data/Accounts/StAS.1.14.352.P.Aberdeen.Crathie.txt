     Statistical Account

it was known how many men were brought into the field,
and what  number was lost in action.  Since that period,
Carn-na-cuimhne has been the watch-word of the coun-
try.  At that period, every person capable of bearing
arms, was obliged to have his arms, a bag, with some
bannocks in it, and a pair of new mended shoes al-
ways in resdiness; apprehended, a stake of wood, the one
end dipped in blood (the blood of any animal), and the
other burnt, as an emblem of fire and sword, was put
into the hands of the person nearest to where the alarm
was given, who immediately ran with all speed, and gave
it to his nearest  neighbour, whether man or woman;
that person ran to the next village or cottage (for mea-
sures had been previously so concerted, that every one
knew his route), and so on. till they went through the
whole cuontry; upon which every man instantly laid
hold of his arms, etc., and repaired to Carn-na-cuimhne,
where they met their leaders also in arms, and ready
to give the necessary orders.  The stake of wood was
named Croishtarich.  At this day, was a fray or squabble
to happen at a market, or any public meeting, such in-
fluence has this word over the minds of the country
people, that the very mention of Carn-na-cuimhne
would, in a moment, collect all the people in this coun-
try, who happened to be at said meeting, to the assistance
of the person assailed.
