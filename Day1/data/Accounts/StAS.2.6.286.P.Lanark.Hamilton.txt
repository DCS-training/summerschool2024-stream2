built by authority of an act of Parliament, and was finished in
1780. It is still burdened with pontage for foot-passengers. Both-
well Bridge over the Clyde, on the road to Glasgow, is undoubted-
ly the oldest structure of the sort in Lanarkshire. It is not known
when it was built. It was till lately only 12 feet wide, but it has
now 32 feet of road-way. There is a private bridge over the Avon
at Fairholm, and another at Ross. The Glasgow and London
mail-coach passes through Hamilton twice a-day; at thirty minutes
past eight in the morning, for London, and at fifteen minutes before
one in the afternoon for Glasgow. There are Glasgow and Edin-
burgh bags at thirty minutes to eight morning, thirty minutes to
twelve noon, and at five afternoon. There is also a post between
Hamilton and Strathaven. The gross revenue of the post-office
here is at an average L. 982 per annum. Thirty years ago there
war only one coach on the Wednesdays between Hamilton and
Glasgow; at present there are seven coaches daily, besides the
mail-coach. Other seven coaches daily pass and repass to places
south of Hamilton. About 128 horses are kept in the town, of
which number seventy are employed in this trade.

	Ecclesiastical State.--The year 1585 is the epoch of the Pres-
byteries of Lanark and Glasgow. About 1590, or earlier, the
large Presbytery of Glasgow was dismembered, by the erection of
the Presbyteries of Hamilton and Paisley. The parishes of Eagles-
ham, Cathcart, and Carmunnock, belonged to Hamilton Presby-
tery till 1596, when they were restored to Glasgow, and the parish
of Kilbride substituted in their place. This Presbytdry includes
the fourteen parishes of the Middle Ward. * The oldest date in the
Presbytery records is 6th September 1687. The oldest date in
the parochial register is 15th January 1650. The books of the
town-council go back only to 3d October 1701; but it is believed
that many older ones, at a remote period, got into the possession
of private individuals and still exist.

<FOOTNOTE>A new Relief Presbytery has lately been established in this town, including ten
congregations; Rev. Mr M'Fariane of Hamilton, Clerk.
