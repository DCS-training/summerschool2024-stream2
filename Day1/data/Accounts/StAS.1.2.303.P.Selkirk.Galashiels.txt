ber of acres in the parish, are calculated at 8000.  Of these,
upwards of 1200 are annualy in tillage, of which above 900
are in oats, and about 300 in barley, pease, clover, potatoes,
and turnips.  The difference in the quality of grain, should al-
so be remarked.  In the worst season, oats, on some dry
grounds, will yield at least at the rate of 8 stone of meal per
boll, Linlithgow measure; while, in the same season, they
will not, on wet lands, yield, 5 stone.  Barley will also weigh,
on drygrounds, 18 1/2 stone, (the Linlithgow boll,) and on marled
ground, scarcely 12 stones; and, in general, all grains are
heavier on a sharp soil.-There can be no doubt, but that
more grain is raised, than consumed in the parish.  But as a
great deal of wheat, flour, and bread, is bought for consump-
tion here, and, on the other hand, as large quantities of eve-
ry fort of grain, wheat excepted, are exported to Edinburgh,
Dalkeith, and Peebles, the surplus of grain produced, more
than what is used, cannot be calculated with any degree of
certainty.

   Ploughs and Cattle.-There are 37 ploughs in the parish,
mostly made after Small's model, some with moulds of cast
metal, and some in the old Scottish form; which many, after
trying the other, think most suitable to a stony soil.  They
are, in general, drawn by two horfes, though four are some-
times seen in a plough, or two horses and two oxen.  There
are 109 horses in the parish; of which 92 are employed in
draught, including ploughs, carts, and huckstering.  The rest
are young, occasionally, perhaps, yoked in the harrows, or
employed as saddle horses.  Single horse carts are mostly used,
and their number may be 64; all, except 5, carrying, solely,
coal, manure, grain, and wood.-The black cattle, may
amount, at least, to 300, mostly young or milch cows, be-
