ny of Wandel.

   Agriculture, Soil, etc.-There are here, as in other places, some
good farmers.  In cultivating poor ground, they make folds
for the sheep in the night, to enrich it with their dung; and
there too they are milked for butter and cheese, the last of
which is not a little prized by these who know it.
   In wet grounds they make drains to carry off the water, and
prepare it for tillage; and they have as good crops on it as in
other places.  In the neighbourhood of Wiston, on the other
side of the Clyde, there is plenty of lime, which some bring,
and lay on ley ground that has been grass, and as they say
rested for 3 or 4 years, on which are good crops for 2 years, but the

by sowing on it now and then ryegrass and clover, as in other part.
There is no such thing practised here as fallowing; but instead
of that they take a crop of potatoes with the plough, which they

spade.  And some have introduced the sowing of turnips for
the cows, and manuring the ground.-The soil varies; in
some parts it is dry, thin, light or gravelly, and shallow; in
some, wet, heavy and clayey, and in others, thick and deep.
It is generally too strong for an English plough of two horses,
and therefore 3 or 4 horses, and sometimes 2 horses, and 2
oxen or cows are usually yoked in a plough.-There is here,
as in other parts, a change of grain, such as bear or barley,
oats, pease and beans, but no wheat is raised.  They begin
to sow pease and oats about the middle or end of March, and
beginning of April; and barley about the end of April and
beginning of May, and when they have done with the former,
and before they enter upon the latter, they set potatoes, of
which every cottage as well as farm house has a quantity suf-
