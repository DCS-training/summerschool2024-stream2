purpose, yet as it is not inclosed or subdivided, it cannot be
sown with wheat to any advantage: for the winter poaching
would ruin the crop.  Much of the rising ground, if inclosed,
summer fallowed, and properly manured, might likewise
produce abundant crops of wheat.  FLax is raised in small
quantities, but chiefly for private use, and seldom for sale:
and the quality of it is at all times more remarkable than the
quantity.  It is generally allowed to be of the finest grain
and colour, of any in Stirlingshire*.  Rye grass and clover
have been introduced about 10 years; and as they have turn-
ed out to great advantage, they are much run upon, at least
by all who have proper inclosures for the purpose: though
they are sometimes sown even for pasture in open
fields.
   But potatoes are the favourite produce of this parish, and it
has been justly and long famous on this account:-I say justly
and long; for it not only gave birth to the gentleman who
first introduced the culture of potatoes into the fields, by
dibbling and hand-hoeing, but it was the scene of his earliest

set vigorously to work in the cultivation of potatoes in the
year 1739.  Before that period, he and others had raised
them in gardens: but there was a vulgar and a common

ed off the above half acre, and sold at half price.
   It was considered as a remarkably good, though not an uncommon
crop.
