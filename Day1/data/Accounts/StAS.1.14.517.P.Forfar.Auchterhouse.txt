when properly mixed by means of summer fallowing,
make a good soil, called, in this place, light land.  Great
improvements in agriculture have been made in this pa-
rish since the year 1776, which took their rise from the
discovery and application of marl, of which there are 3
large fields and a small one.  The last mentioned, with
2 of the former, belong to the Earl of Airly; the other
to Captain Laird of Strathmartine and Mr. Yeoman of
Ballbeuchly.  The surface of these fields consists of 2 feet
rich carth; below which are 6 feet of moss; under the
moss; 4 or 5 feet of clay and sand:  then, the first bed of
marl; in some places, 7 feet deep; in others, not above
3:  Beneath this, there lies another stratum of clay of 5
feet; and next, the second bed of marl, generally of the
same depth with the first; which has seldom, if ever, been
wrought, because of the water which abounds, and which
it would be extremely difficult and expensive to draw off.
In one of Lord Ainy's mosses, there is a rock of a pecu-
liar species; hard as slint, and black as coal.  Where it
is necessary to open drains through it, it has always been
found impracticable, without the aid of gunpower, as no
tool can make any impression upon it.  Yet, obdurate as
it is found in its natural situation, when exposed to the
winter frost and rain, it crumbles into pieces, and is good
for no purpose.-Deers horns, of a great size, have often 
been found, at a considerable depth in the mosses; as also
oak trees, hazle, and other wood.-The marl is sold at
9d. the boll; of which the digger has 3 1/2d.  Fifty or sixty 
bolls are commonly allowed to each acre.  And the effect 
of marl (together with the consequent improvements), has
been such as to raise the rent of land from 5s. to 10s.,
15s., 20s., and even to 40s. Sterling the acre.
