called butts; in other places, they are termed croses.
Thus, very commonly from 8 to 15 families live upon
one small farm, so that they must, by consequence, live
very poorly themselves, although they pay but a very
moderate rent to the landlord.  The landlords, however,
seem now clear to adopt a very different mode of letting
their lands, which is, to conjoin 2 or 3 farms together,
and let them as one possession to one tenant; by which
means, they will receive a much greater rent, and the te-
nants will live more comfortably.  Although the genera-
lity of tenants are thus small, yet there is in the parish
1 tenant who possesses 3 farms, 2 who possess 1 each, and
2 who possess 2 each.

oats in this parish in the begining of April.  When
they have done with their oats, which is generally be-
fore the end of the month, they begin to plant their po-
tatoes; and as this is an operation that seldom consumes
much time, for they are all planted with the plough,
they begin the sowing of barley in the beginning of May,
and it is always the end of that month, or perhaps the
beginning of June, before they have done.  Next comes
on the making of peats, which, together with leading
the same, (a very troublesome and tedious job), con-
sumes the most of the remaining part of summer.  Bar- 
ley harvest commonly begins about the middle of Au-
gust, and oats are mostly cut in September and Octo-
ber.  In wet late seasons, the harvest may not perhaps
be entirely finished until the 12th of November.  In the
year 1787, it was still later.  The soil of this parish, as
well as-that of Glendarual, seems peculiarly adapted for
producing flax; and the farmers also seem inclined to
