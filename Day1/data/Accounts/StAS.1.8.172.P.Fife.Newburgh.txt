     Statistical Account

Tay may find a place in the statistical account of any district,
that reaches to its border.  This noble river, having received
the accession of the water of the Earn, begins at Newburgh,
to assume the appearance of an arm of the sea; and, by the in-
habitants of that town and neighbourhood, is denominated
the Broad Water.  When the tide in it, however, has ebbed,
it leaves a considerable part of its channel dry; and, collect-
ing itself into two currents, passes, along the opposite tides of
its bed, in what are termed the North and South Deeps.  The
South Deep, contains by far the greatest quantity of water,
and furnishes the course, which vessels of burden usually hold,
in passing up and down the river.  As far up as Newburgh,
the Tay admits vessels of 500 tons burden; but above the
confluence of the Earn, beyond which Perth is situated, ves-
sels of 200 tons burden, when deep laden, proceed with dif-
ficulty.  Vessels, however, of about 90 or 100 tons burden,
(in which the trade with Perth is usually carried on,) easily
make the shore of Perth; and when larger vessels are employ-
ed in that trade, part of their cargoes is distributed among
lighters, on their arrival at the shore of Newburgh.

   Salmon Fishing.-Besides being favourable to commerce,
the lay furnishes great quantities of excellent salmon, the
fishing of which has, especially of late years, become a con-
siderable source of wealth to all who have property in the
river.  The proprietor of that part of its channel, on the south
side, which corresponds to the length of the parish of New-
burgh, draws about 200 L. Sterling, of yearly rent, for his
fishings; and, in situations farther up, where the channel
not so broad, nor the tide so powerful, proprietors receive a
much greater rent for a much less extent of water.  What
enables fishermen to pay such high rents, is, the great price
