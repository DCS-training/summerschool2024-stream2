      But, in the extensive low-ground which adjoins the sea, and
 which topographical appearances alone sufficiently indicate as the
 subject of a cyclical overflow and retrocession of the tide, other
 strata have found place. There is first a layer of peat-moss,
 varying from 10 to 18 inches in depth, the result apparently
 of the decomposition of a forest which once occupied the plain;
 for both at the eastern boundary, where the moss reaches the
 surface, and is dug for fuel, as also along the course of "the river,"
 when a freshet has washed away its channel to an unusual depth,
 and even where the tide now ebbs and flows, at low water, the
 roots of large trees, (among which, oaks are said to be most fre-
 quent,) are occasionally exposed. About the confines of this pa-
 rish with that of Fearn, there was lately found in the moss a
 bronze battle-axe, now in the possession of Mr Mackinlay of the
 Tain Academy; and in digging a new channel, a few years since,
 for part of the above-mentioned stream, a branching deer's horn
 of extraordinary size was exhumed. Above the moss, succeeds a
 stratum of fine sand, which constituted the bed of the sea when
 it last covered this uniform plain, forming by the action of its
 waves the escarpment which bounds it; thereafter, in the slow
 retiring of the water, the sandy level was left to view, to be
 in time covered by a cultivable alluvial soil; but the tide is
 again advancing to re-shroud it with its mantle, and to reclaim
 its own. Some parts, indeed, have been already wrested from
 the use of man, and converted into barren downs, by the sea
 sand with which they have been overblown; especially the large
 district of the Morrich m•r, which the older inhabitants re-
 member to have seen postured as a common, and which was turn-
 ed (it is said in a single night) into an and waste. All along the
 coast, the horizontal layer of shells, which the sea is uncovering
 in its advance, distinctly marks the level of the bed which it for-
 merly occupied. Walking to the Morrich mor, our steps are on the
 remains of a former age, ground into powder by the tread of men;
 and where in some places the banks have been blown away by the
 wind, a rich treasure of beautiful shells has been disclosed,-now,
 however, robbed of all its finest specimens, by frequent resort.
      Zoology.-It is not known whether any species of of animals
 formerly existing in the parish, have become extinct. At
 least one, however, which did not formerly exist in it, name-
 ly, the rat, has been introduced within the last few years,
 and has, to the annoyance of the inhabitants, rapidly multi-
