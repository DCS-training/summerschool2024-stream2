to build a kirk.  He was forced, for the space of six years, 
to preach in the fields.  In the year 1772, he entered a 
process of augmentation against them; and in 1775, ob-
tained a decrees of modification for fixing the stipend at
four chalders of victual, one half oat-meal, the other half
bear, with L.600 Scots, and L.40 Scots for communion-
elements; a sum by far too small for defraying the expen-
ces of the communion in so populous a parish.  As there
is no manse, the heritors allow L.10 Sterling per annum
until one is built.

   Heritors, etc-There are eleven proprietors in the pa-
rish, of whom two only are resident.  There are four te-
nants who occupy extensive farms.  One of them pays of
rent yearly L. 256, another L. 105, a third L.  103; all ex-
clusive of public burdens.  There is a considerable number
of smaller tenants.

   Poor.- The number of poor on the parish-roll is 15.
They are supported by the interest of L. 20, which was
mortified by the late Campbell of Stonefield.  To this
very small sum is added the collections at the church, which
are extremely inconsiderable.
