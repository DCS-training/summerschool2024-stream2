quence.  The present incumbent, therefore, chose to have his
manse on the north side, where there is peat ground in abun-
dance, and very near, rather than where it formerly was, with
the above advantages, but with the disadvantage of carrying
peats from a considerable distance, both by land and water,
with much trouble, and at a considerable expence.
   When the present manse was built, it was likewise inten-
ded to excamb the glebe; and it was in great forwardness to
be accomplished, when some election punctilio put a stop to
it.  Mr Moodie of Melsetter, on whose property the manse
stands, still proposes to complete the excambion, to which
the present incumbent is ready to accede, being persuaded
that it would be for the interest of his successors, as well as
for his own.
   The present rent of the glebe is 5 L. 11 s. in money; and
the tenant has lately had a small croft, formerly let to a cot-
tar, given him without any additional rent.  The glebe was
much injured in the last incumbent's * time, by a planking
which never was authorised by his presbytery; but, as the
division stands at present, it is pretty extensive and improve-
able.
