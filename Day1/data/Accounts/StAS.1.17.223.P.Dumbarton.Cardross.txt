     Se potius tradidisse decuit,
     Hanc columnam.
     Amoris eheu!  mane monumentum,
     In ipsis Leviniae ripis
     Quas, versiculis, sub exitu vitae, illustratas,
     Primis, infans, vagitibus personuit,
     Ponendam curavit

   Antiquities.-A little west of the Leven, upon a small emi-
nence called Castle hill, stood, it is said, a castle, at times the
residence of King Robert Bruce.  In this castle, of which
no vestige is now discernible, that favourite prince, as history
and tradition informs us, breathed his last.  A farm in the
neighbourhood still pays to the superior a feu-duty called
dog-meal.  This tax is supposed to have been originally im-
posed for the maintenance of his Majesty's hounds.

   Character.-The people in general are sober and indus-
trious The introduction of manufactures has, no doubt,
produced some change in their habits and manners; and
whether this change may operate more in the end to their
advantage or hurt, time alone can determine.
