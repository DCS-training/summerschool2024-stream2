       It is to be regretted, however, that the moral improvement of
     the ploughmen has not kept pace with that of the land, which
     they know so well how to cultivate. The bothy system may be
     regarded as the main cause of this. Young men associate to-
     gether in an out-house of the farm, cook their own victuals, which
     is generally oatmeal brose and milk. Thus they never meet in a
     domestic capacity, spend much of their time, especially in winter,
     not under the inspection of their masters, and the bad tend to cor-
     rupt the good. The evil arising from these causes is not very fla-
     grant as yet. But instances of young men breaking their contracts,
     and becoming regardless of the duties of religion, occasionally oc-
     cur. A corrective of this might perhaps be found by introdu-
     cing the practice of having married hinds on the farm, as in East
     Lothian, and causing the unmarried young men to live in their
     families. At present farm-servants who have wives have their
     houses not on the farms to which they belong, but in the village.
       The police of Stanley is very efficient; and ill-behaved persons
     when found out, are forthwith discharged from the mills. And
     by this means there is not a more orderly or a more respectable
     manufacturing population in the empire than the inhabitants of
     that village. But the want of an active Justice of the Peace, as-
     sisted by a few steady and faithful constables, together with a tem-
     porary place of confinement for delinquents is deeply felt occa-
     sionally at Bankfoot, to check the exuberance of youthful frolic.
