not registered; and the people in general all over this
country having an idea of property in their family bury-

so, they seem to feel themselves guilty, not only of viola-
ting a natural propensity in men to sleep with their fathers,
but also of infringing a sacred obligation, as they say, sanc-
tioned by the example of patriarchs, at the cave in the field
of Macpelah.  In articles of population, an account of the
ages of different classes of persons have been thought ex-
pedient and useful.  This the writer has been obliged to
omit, except with regard to children, who neither fear nor
blush to tell their age; and those who glory in "prattling
"o'er the tales of other years."  The children mentioned
above are under 10 years of age; of the other venerable
class, there are 15 upwards of 70, nine upwards of 80, three
above 90, and one near 100 years old.  During the late
incumbent's ministry here, a woman died at Fairnington
about the age of 120.
