are bought in at 2 and 3 years old, and sold the next sea-
son.  The strongest of them are driven next spring to the
neighbourhood of London.  The younger and lesser are 
kept on till August, and sold in the north of England.
Sometimes these are changed oftener than once or twice
in a year.  Of the young cattle bred here, the slots, at 18
months old, are sold at Dumfries, and bought by the Gal-
loway graziers; and the heisers not kept for breeding are
sent into the north of England in September.  These are
considered a true good breed of cattle, and bring as much
money in proportion to their bone as any in Scotland, ex-
cepting only West Highlanders.  The sheep kept here are
got in lambs from the breeders, and sold in hogs, i.e. year
old's.  For particular farms, reckoned the highest or bleak-
est, they are bought in hogs, and sold in dinmonts, i. e.
wedders rising two years old.
   This mode of farming, by changing stocks, has advan-
tages and disadvantages in the extreme.  When managed
with attention and skill, and sufficient funds, the return is
certain, and the difference of high or low prices will af-
fect the farmer very little.  If he sell cheap, he buys pro-
portionally; and when he sells even at the same prices he
bought in at the year before, he may still have enough
less to pay his rent.  His risk however is great.  He sells
his whole stock yearly, or osterner, in place of selling only
the yearly cast of his stock as the breeder does.  He has o-
ther material disadvantages.  He is led often away from
his home and farm, which must suffer in his absence; and
if he have not more than an ordinary share of prudence, he
is led to dissipation.

   Enclosing.-There are yet little enclosed lands in the pa-
rish.  The farms for breeding sheep are from 500 to 2500
acres.  In these there is room to hirsel or keep separate,
