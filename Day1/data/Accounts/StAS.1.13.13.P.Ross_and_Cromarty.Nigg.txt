     of Nigg.

     NUMBER II.

     (COUNTRY AND SYNOD OF ROSS, PRESBYTERY OF TAIN.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER MACADAM.

     Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

   THE meaning of the word Nigg or Neig, as it was for-
merly written, is uncertain.  Some suppose that it is a
corruption of the word Niuc or Nook, and that this parish
is so called, because it lies in a corner of the country; but
there is no great ground for this supposition, as there are
few, if any instances, of the Gaelic names of places be-
ing corrupted; especially in those parts where the Gaelic
continues to be the living language of the country.  The
more probable opinion is, that it is Celtic term, expres-
sive of the peninsular situation of the place, it being almost
surrounded by water; and what, in some measure, corrobo-
rates this opinion is, that the parish of Nigg, in the shire of
Kincardine, is exactly similar in situation to his parish.-
The parish of Nigg is above 5 miles long, and in some pla-
ces between 2 and 3 broad.  It lies from S. W. to N. E.
