   This is produce is in proportion to the land rent as five to one.  Five rents
is certainly a larger proportion than is usally expected by the tenant; but
it is to be considered, that a larger profits is essential for a very small farmer,
than for a large one; and that a less proportion of the produced of arable land,
can be paid from poor land, than from rich.  Where farms are very small as
is too much the case in the northern parts of Scotland, namely, from L. 5
to L. 10 per annum, in common years the farmer requires almost the whole
produce to maintain his family, and to desray the expences of cultivation.
Even on a farm of L. 20 per annum, five rents will do little more.  But
when, in addition to the smallness of the farm, the produce per acre is in-
considerable, which, from the preceding statement, there is every reason to
believe, it is not to be wondered at, that so large a portionof the produce
should be necessary for the occupier.
   These calculations, however, furnish, on the whole, no unpromising pro-
spect, both to the proprietors of this county, and to the public.  It would
appear, that the produce of Aberdeenshire, is only at the rate of about 24 s.
per Scotch acre, or  19 s. per English acre; which, however considerable,
