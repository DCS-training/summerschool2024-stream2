             I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
           Name.-The word Olrick (or Olrig), is of Norwegian deri-
	vation, and may be interpreted " the son of Erick:" it was ap-

	chief of that name on this part of the coast, about the end of
	the eighth or the beginning of the ninth century when an inva-
	sion of this northern part of the kingdom is supposed to, have taken
	place.
	   Extent.-The length of the parish from north-west to south-east
	is 5 miles, its medium breadth 3 miles: and it contains 15 1/2
	square miles, or about 10,000 imperial acres. It is bounded on the
	west, east, and south by the parishes of Thurso, Dunnet, and
	Bower,-and the sea is the boundary on the north.
	   Soil and Produce.-The soil throughout the parish may
	be considered good; and as improvements in agriculture are car-
	ried on, on the most approved plans, perhaps there is not a parish
	in the north of Scotland where better crops of all kinds of useful
	produce are raised. There is abundance of marl in the parish,
