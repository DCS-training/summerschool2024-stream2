he has this year tried to fence after another manner.  He
has drawn a line, within water-mark, at a considerable di-
stance from the beach, and upon it laid down stones, not
built, nor very regular, but in such sort as to form a broad
base, and to narrow gradually towards the top, and about
5 or 6 feet high.  This bulwark of stones is expected to
break the force of the flood-tide, even in stormy weather,
so that it may beat with less violence against the land; and
as in the reflux it will certainly cause a considerable space
of dead water, a greater quantity of mud or sediment will
be left behind, which, in time, will probably increase to
much in bulk, and also in firmness, that needs may be plant-
ed with a probability of success; and if they once are esta-
blished, the fence will bid fair to be durable: Also at ano-
ther place, where the river approaches nearer to the braes
(high banks), he has dug a trench of about 3 feet deep, and
as broad, the outside nearly perpendicular, but perfectly co-
vered with the beach; the inside sloping upwards to hu-
mour the acclevity of the bank.  In this trench are
thrown stones, as regularly as it can be done by a common
labourer, and, when the trench is full, more stone are laid
up, so as to cover the face of the bank higher up than any
tide flows.  From the solidity of the foundation, and the
gentleness of the acclivity, this also is expected to answer.
If either of these do, they will save much expence; but of
that experience must judge.

   Levelling in Clay.-The ridges upon the clay part of the
Mains of Caftle-Huntly were crooked, unequal, irregular,
and liable in rainy seasons to be drenched with water, when
Mr Paterson got possession of it in 1779.  But he has levelled
the whole, except one field, which does not require it so
much; straighted all the ridges, rounded them sufficiently
