berties of the borough, northward, begin at a small hill or
eminence a short way from the entrance of the city, called
the Gallowhill.  It seems Brechin had been in former times
the county town, or at least the sheriff had frequently held
his courts here.  As malefactors, convicted of crimes which
fell under the cognizance of the sheriff, had been executed
on this hill or ominence it retains to this day the name of
the Gallowhill.
   There is a small rivulet or burn which rises to the west of
Brechin, and runs directly eastward.  Several houses and lands
on the north side of this rivulet are within the royalty.  This
burn soon alters its direction, and runs southward through
a large den, which is the property of the borough, and a
common pasturage to the cows and cattle of the citizens in
the summer season.  It is commonly called the Den-burn.
This small burn terminates the royalty on the east.  No part
of the royalty is situated on the east side of this burn, except
a very few houses on what is called the Cadger-brae.  The
eastern extremity of the borough, known by the name of the
Cadger-wynd, lies wholly on the west side of the burn.
This wynd had formerly been inhabited by fishmongers, whose
business it was to furnish the citizens of Brechin with a con-
stant supply of fish from different parts of the coast.  Hence
probably it received its denomination.
   The Den-burn, passing by the east end of the Cadger-
wynd, runs a considerable way southward, till it falls into
the Southesk, at what is called the Ford-mouth.  The hou-
ses on the west side, all the way to the Ford-mouth, are with-
in the royalty.  Those on the other side belong to Southesk,
   The whole length of the borough from north to south, that
is, from the Gallowhill to the Ford-mouth, is nearly an Eng-
lish mile.
   The royalty of Brechin, to the west, extends half an Eng-
