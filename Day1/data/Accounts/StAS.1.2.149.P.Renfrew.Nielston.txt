   Population.-There are difficulties in ascertaining the num-
ber of people in this parish, not known in parishes more re-
mote, and less populous or commercial.  When it is consider-
ed, that there are two cotton mills erected, and two more e-
recting, one large printfield, and twelve bleachfields, the
mode of precisely ascertaining the number of inhabitants for
any given time beyond a few months, is but uncertain.  At
these fields, for example, there are a number of women not hav-
ing families, nor residing in families, but in women-houses, so
called, erected on purpose near almost every field, where
they lodge only during the working season, repairing to the
neighbouring towns during the winter months, and perhaps
not returning again to the same fields.  This migratory class,
in number about 93, lodge at present in seven women-houses,
and are not included in the following list.  If it be thought
proper to add them, it is easily done, and the consequences
are obvious.  They will add their amount to the number of 
souls in general, and to the article of females in particular,
and overbalance the males, which would not otherwise be the
case: they will also add their number to the article of those
above 15 years of age; and to that of servants; with this
discrimination, that they are only employed in bleaching
and drying goods.
   The following list was taken up within these few months,
and is composed of those who have residence by property, by
leases, or by serving from term to term in families, including
the renters of houses, as being a kind of lease-holders.
