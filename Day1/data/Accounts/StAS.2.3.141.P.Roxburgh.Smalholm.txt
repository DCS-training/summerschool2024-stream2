ters is 1642. They have been regularly kept, and are in a pretty
good state of preservation.
    Antiquities.-On the south-west corner of the parish, in the
farm of Sandyknow, the property of Mr Scott of Harden, among
a cluster of rocks, stands "Smalholm Tower," a large square
building, supposed to have been a "border keep" before the
union of the kingdoms. This tower has long been in a ruinous
condition, but has acquired an interest in modern times, from the
author of Waverley having spent part of his infancy in its vi-
cinity, and from his having ascribed, in a great measure, to that
circumstance the peculiar character of his poetry. In the Min-
strelsy of the Scottish Border, Sir Walter Scott, in a note pre-
fixed to "The Eve of St John," says, it was in order to celebrate
Smalholm Tower and its vicinity, which had been the residence of
his infancy, that he had written that border tale; and in the intro-
duction to the third canto of Marmion, while describing the influ-
ence of that early residence on his style of poetry, he alludes to
the tower and the surrounding crags.*
