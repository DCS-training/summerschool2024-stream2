   Market-Towm.-The nearest market-town is Aberdeen, which
is distant forty-eight miles.
   Means of Communication.-There is a post-office at Castletown
of Braemar, with a daily post to and from Aberdeen, and there is
to be a receiving office at Crathie, which will prove a very great
convenience to the district.  A chain bridge was erected across
the Dee, near the manse, in the year 1834, which has superseded
the use of two ferry boats, and is of great service to the district.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The church of Crathie was rebuilt on a
new site, and in a very eligible situation, in 1805, and was finished
in 1806.  It is a plain, but elegant structure, and affords very
comfortable accommodation for all the parishioners ; it being in-
tended that all attending religious ordinances in the whole united
parish should be accommodated there at the dispensation of the
Lord's Supper, the church contains about 1400 sittings, all free.
The manse was built about forty years since; it is a substantial,
well-finished house, and is in a good state of repair.  An excellent
set of office-houses was built in 1823, which are likewise in com-
plete repair.
  The stipend is 17 chalders, halfmeal, half barley.  The glebe
is from six to seven acres, and may be worth L.10 a-year.  There is
no grass glebe.  The Queen is patron.  There are no Dissent-
ers in the parish, but there are some Roman Catholics.  At
Castletown of Braemar, there is an ordained missionary regularly
stationed, who is supported by the Royal Bounty.  There is also
a Roman-Catholic chapel, and a resident priest.  The number of
souls under his care is 378.  About two-thirds of the Protestant
