   Hand Mills.-Formerly hand mills or querns (as they are
called), were the only instruments used in this country for
grinding corn; but it is probable, that when those were
found unequal to the demand, mills were built by the
landlord who had water at his command, as a benefit to his
tenants and retainers; and that the miller became bound
not only to grind all the corns used by the tenants upon the
estate, but also to send for them and return them in meal;
for which certain multures in kind, that is certain quantities
of the corns (millers tolls) were allowed, which was called
thirlage.  The tenants were also obliged to give their help
in preparing the corn for grinding, and cleaning the mill-
lead, i. e. the tract which conducts the water for the mill
wheel, etc.
   In those days, when mills were but few in number, the
privilege of getting their corns ground might be a great
convenience at any price; but afterwards, when their num-
bers encreased, and the millers became rivals for employ-
ment, what was originally meant as an useful convenience
became a very great hardship.  The baron, to keep up the
rent of his mill, obliged his tenants to grind all their corns
there as formerly, although they could have got their crops
manufactured cheaper at other mills, where, naturally, the
rates were lowered to those who were not obliged to fre-
quent them, in order to invite customers; while the millers
became inattentive, negligent, and sometimes insolent and
overbearing, to those who were bound to their mill.  Hence
the grievance of thirlage, which is so much complained of.

   Tacks or Leases formerly.-The tacks (leases) entered
into, between 1760 and 1770, with the greater tenants in
this parish, were in general for 38 years, to themselves,
heirs, executors and assignees, with power to sublet.  They
were all thirled to a particular mill; their restrictions were
