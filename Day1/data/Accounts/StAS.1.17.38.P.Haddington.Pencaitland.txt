thoroughfare for the country, and especially from the pas-
sage upon them for coal and lime from a great part of East
Lothian.  The county, however, have at last turned their at-
tention to these particulars, and have this year allocated a
considerable sum for one, and erected a toll-bar upon another
of the great roads; by means of which, it is expected they
will be put into good repair, and prove, in that event, of
much utility to the country.  Notwithstanding the bad state
in which the roads in general are, much has been done for
them by Sir ANDREW LAUDER, on the south side of the
Tyne.  From his accurate reports, given in annually to the
justices of the peace, it appears, that, besides the faithful ap-

this present date (February 1794), expended 500 l. and in

and there is reason to believe, that a similiar expenditure may
be expected from him for the future.  Commendation is
here by no means necessary, but a wish may perhaps be ex-
pressed, that proprietors in general would shew a like atten-
tion to that obvious fact, that good roads are the first and
most beneficial improvement to a conntry.

consequently employ additional hands.  This little fact, per-

tors have too generally favoured the introduction of trades
people, from the sole consideration of raising their rent-roll,
by letting a very few acres at a much higher rate than far-
