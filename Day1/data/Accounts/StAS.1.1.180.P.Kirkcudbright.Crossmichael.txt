     Statistical Account

   Productions.-About 80 acres are planted with trees, all of
which are in a thriving condition.  Grass is raised for the
218 horses mentioned above, and for 4 affes, 25 goats, 600
sheep, and 1840 black cattle.  The breeding system is in ge-
neral pursued.  The highest recommendation of a cow is,
that she brings up a good beast, and not, as elsewhere, than
she gives much milk; and it has even become a proverb, that
"a good farmer would rather kill his old son than  kill a
"calf."  The Galloway cattle have one characteristic which
naturalists may think incredible; they are almost all without
horns! Dr Samuel Johnson, in his journey to the Western
Islands, (London edition, 1775, pag. 186), has the following
notable passage: "Of their black cattle, some are without
"horns, called by the Scots humble cows, as we call a bee a
"humble bee that wants a sting.  Whether this difference
"be specific or accidental, though we inquired with great di
"ligence, we could not be informed.  We are not very sure
"that the bull is ever without horns, though we have been
"told that such bulls there are.  What is produced by put-
"ting a horned and an unhorned male and female together,
"no man has ever tried, who thought the result worthy of
"observation."  Though it may favour of arrogance, the
high authority quoted must be flatly contradicted.  There is
not within the bounds of this parish a single bull, nor a male
of any other species, except a few goats and rams, with horns.
The experiment the philosopher wished for, has been tried a
thousand times, and the result has been observed to be a
calf, sometimes with, and sometimes without horns, but ne-
ver, as the Doctor most probably expected, an unicorn.  A few
cattle are fatted here for home consumption, and for the
Dumfries market, but the far greater part of those reared
are disposed of, at 3 and 4 years of age, to the drovers, who
carry them up to London, but chiefly to Norfolk and Suffolk.
