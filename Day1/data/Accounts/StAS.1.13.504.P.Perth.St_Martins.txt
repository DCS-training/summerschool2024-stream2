share of that useful commodity.  Agriculture is much im-
proved of late years here, and grass seeds, turnips, and po-
totoes are generally  cultivated by the farmers.  Lime brought
from Perth is the manure made use of.  There are a good 
many enclosures in the parish.  Carts, ploughs, and other
labouring utensils, are made after the most approved mo-
dels.  The labour is performed entirely by horses, and 
few cattle of any kind are reared, excepting some cows.
Our outfield at 10 s.  We have some farms rented at L. 100,
but the general average rent is from L. 20 to L. 30.  The 
number of farms is diminishing, as the proprietors are find-
ding their advantage in abolishing pendicles, and conver-
ting them into larger farms.  The parish not only supplies 
itself with provitions, but disposes of a considerable quan-
tity of grain, particularly barley, to the breweries and dis-
tilleries about Perth.  About 20 years ago there was scarcely
any wheat, now we have about 40 or 50 acres yearly.
Wheat is generally sown in September, and reaped in Sep-
tember following.  Oats are sown in March, and reaped in
September.  Barley is sown in May, and reaped in the end 
of August.  Flax is sown in May, and reaped in August.

   Roads.-The turnpike road from Perth to Cupar of
Angus, passes through the south side of this parish; and 
there is another turnpike road in contemplation from Perth
to Blairgowrie, which is to pass through the west end of 
the parish.  Turnpike roads are now, contrary to former
prejudice, looked on by the country people, as a very great 
advantage to trade and agriculture.  The statue labour is 
commuted, and is now employed on the crofs roads, to much
greater advantage than when it was exacted in kind.
