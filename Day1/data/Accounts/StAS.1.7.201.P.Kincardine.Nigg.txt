only beginning to be understood and tried.

   Manures.-To animal dung and ashes, that manure pro-
duced in the fishing villages, from the mixture of all oily
and fishy substances, is used.  It favours bear and green
crops; buts when used much, renders the soil unfit for pro-
ducing oats.  Hence that toil is called poisoined land.  Another
manure is ware and sea-weed.  It is brought to land in the
Bay of Nigg, and at the mouth of the harbour principally,
after an agitation of the sea, when the wind blows in points
from the north, round by the west, to the south; that is,
blows from the land; so that the breeze which would carry
a body out to sea on its surface, brings this substance, at the
bottom, or swimming in it, in a contrary direction, on shore;
an object suggesting the manner of the internal motion of
water agitated by wind*.  This ware is of three kinds, ob-
tained at different seasons.  The first is the green slake,
which grows in the river, is washed down by the summer
floods, and is brought ashore at the harbour-mouth.  The
second kind is composed of various marine plants torn from
the rocks by the storms, and driven to land, from the end of
harvest throughout winter.  The last is the top of the carn
tangle, (fucus digitatus supposed), which that plant throws,
commonly in the end of May, or sometimes later, especially
with rains or motion of the sea, and is carried to shore.
The sea-weed produces a crop of bear, a little inferior in

*In the same manner, the wind in the points from the east
draws into the sea the sand, covering stones on a shelving bank
when it blows an easterly storm, while it brings wreck woods
on the surface, ashore.
