   The monastery which was founded in the year 1217, by
Malcolm Thane of Fife, lies northwest from St Mungo's, at
the head of the town; on a rising ground, commanding a
beautiful and extensive prospect of the Firth; considerable
remains of it are yet to be seen; on the north side of it was
the abbey church, which had a tower or steeple in the middle
of it, which continues still entire, as also the part of the
church which is now made use of for the parish church.  The
abbey church was dedicated not only to the Virgin Mary,
but also to St Serf; who was considered as the tutelar saint
of this place, in honour of whom, there was an annual pro-

which, all the inhabitants, men and women, young and old,
assembled and carried green branches through the town,
decking the public places with flowers, and spent the rest of
the day in festivity.  The procession is still continued, though
the day is changed from the Saint's day, to the present King's
birth-day.
   The Earls of Argyle who were formerly wont to reside at
Castle Campbell, a strong hold of theirs on the south side of
the Ochils, are said to have been heritable bailies of the abbey;
by them it was disposed to Colvill of Ochiltree, in whose fa-
mily the office continued, till the heritable jurisdictions were
taken away, anno 1743.
   The Argyle family had a chapel adjoining to, and commu-
nicating with the church, a part of which still remains; and
some of the family were buried there.
   A convent was sent to this abbey, from the abbey of Kin-
loss, with Hugh the first abbot.  John Hog was abbot of
this place, 14th April 1484, when Culross was erected into
a burgh of barony.  The last abbot of this place was Alexan-
der son to Sir James Colvill of Ochiltree, who was admitted
