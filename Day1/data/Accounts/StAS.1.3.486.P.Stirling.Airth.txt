     PARISH OF AIRTH.

     (County of Stirling.)

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT URE.

     Origin of the Name.
   THE name Airth, is of Gaelic extraction, and is derived
from the word ard or ardbe, which, in that language,
signifies a high or eminent place.  Probably it bears that
name, because the hill of Airth, on the south-east corner of
which the church and mansion-house are built, rises consi-
derably higher than the grounds immediately adjacent.  The
perpendicular height of this hill is upwards of 70 feet.
From the mansion  house of Airth, and every part of the
Hill, there is a delightful and extensive prospect, over a coun-
try rich, populous, and beautifully diversified.  In this pros-
pect, part of 10 or 12 countries are to be seen.

   Situation and Extent.-Airth lies in the country and presby-
tery of Stirling, and in the synod of Perth and Stirling.
The extent of the parish, upon the side of the river, is about
6 miles, its medium lenght 5, and its breadth fully 2 miles.
The figure is irregural, and approaches nearest to the parallel-
logram.  The whole parish is a plain, the hills of Airth and
Dunmore excepted.  This last hill is termed, by some wri-
ters, Airth-beg, or Little Airth.
