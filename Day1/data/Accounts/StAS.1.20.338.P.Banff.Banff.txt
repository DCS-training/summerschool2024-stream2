     Statistical Account

   Here is a small hospital or bede-house, which affords lodg-
ing to eight poor decayed women.  It has no other endow-
ment than what is derived from the parochial funds, and
the donations of charitable individuals*.
   In few places are the poor supplied with more liberality
than in Banff.  Hence the great number of this description
who resort hither from neighbouring parishes, and become
stationary.  At the same time, it may be remarked, that
here as in most other towns, indigence is often marked
with the appearance of greater wretchedness than in coun-
try villages, or the solitary cottage.
   Those who are entrusted with the management of the
poor's funds, have too frequent cause to observe, and to la-
ment, that our charitable contributions, intended as the re-
ward of merit, or the refuge of misfortune, are sometimes,
and unavoidably, bestowed on the indolent, the intempe-
rate, and the undeserving, whether natives or strangers.
But, "to do the best, (observes and eloquent writer), can
"seldom be the lot of man; it is sufficient if, when oppor-
"tunities are presented, he is ready to do good.  How
"little virtue could be practiced if beneficence were to
"wait always for the most proper objects, and the noblest
"occasions; occasions that may never happen, and objects
"that may never be found."

   Antiquities.-Few remains of antiquity are to be seen in
this parish, to attract observation.  Of these few, the old
religious houses merit a place in this account.

<FOOTNOTE>

*My George Smith, a native of this county, lately bequeathed L. 1000
Sterling to the Magistrates of of Banff, for the express purpose of building an
hospital or infirmary.  The money becomes soon payable, and such an use-
ful institution will prove a most substantial benefit to this part of the coun-
try, so far distant from the Infirmary at Aberdeen.
