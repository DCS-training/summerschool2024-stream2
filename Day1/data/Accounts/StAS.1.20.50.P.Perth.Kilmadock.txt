the Loch.  It is very pleasant to behold these sagacious birds
flying in a beautiful string, beating the air most uniformly
and regular, and keeping watch by turns, even on their
journey.

   Roads and Bridges.-The great roads from Edinburgh
to Fort-William, and from Glasgow to Perth, pass through
this parish, crossing each other at the town of Doune.  These
roads are far from being in good order, but application is
made for making them turnpike.  The road to Fort-Wil-
liam passes along the north side of Teith.
   Except these two roads, there are no other roads, public
or private, in the parish, passable in bad weather.
   The public are equally ill supplied with bridges, though,
it is evident, from the preceding description of the rivers
and burns, that communication must be much obstructed in
time of floods.  There is no bridge over Teith, below Cal-
lander, except one near Doune, called the Bridge of Teith.
This is a strong building of 2 arches, and has stood the test
of 266 winters, though often in extreme danger, by the ra-
pidity of the current, in time of thaw, after forst.  This
useful bridge was erected by Robert Spittal, tailor to King
James V. about the year 1530, previous to which, there
was only a ferry-boat; and tradition reports, that Mr Spittal
coming this way, happened to leave his money behind;
the churlish boatman refused to ferry him over; to resent
which insult, the generous tailor immediately built the
bridge, and so punished the boatman, by ruining his busi-
ness.  But, be this as it may, Mr Spittal was a man of a
noble mind, and benevolent heart; and the hospital he
founded in Stirling, for the relief of poor tradesmen, is ano-
ther monument of his patriotic virtue.
