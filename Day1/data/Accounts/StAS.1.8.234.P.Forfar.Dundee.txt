For books and education to poor children, salaries to teachers

   In the year 1790, instead of a balance saved, a debt of 81 L.
5 s. 7 3/4d., had been contracted, though the distributions were
85 l. 12 s. 6d. less.  But on the intimation of this to the con-
gregations, their collections were immediately and cheerfully in-
creased, so as to produce an annual rise of 160 L. 17 s. 0 1/4 d.
The constant weekly allowance to pensioners, as may appear
from the above statement, is no greater than 10 d. and a small
fraction, and may perhaps be thought too scanty.  But it
ought to be considered, that it is an average allowance; that
the greatest part of the pensioners are capable of earning some-
thing by their work; that the principal use of stated charities
is merely to supply the deficiencies of such earning; and that,
when they become so liberal as to render work unnecessary,
or when living by charity ceases to be dishonourable, they
are utterly destructive of prudence, foresight, sobriety and
economy.
   Other funds, principally or wholely under the management
of the kirk-session are,
