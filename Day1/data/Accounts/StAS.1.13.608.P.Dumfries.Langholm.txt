     Statistical Account

the fine bridge thrown over the Elk this summer (1793)
at Gilnocky, his Grace's coal-pit at Byreburn is only 5
miles distant, where there is a prospect of a plentiful sup-
ply by a large water-engine, and other machinery, con-
structed upon a new plan by the ingenious Mr Keir.  Wool
of the best quality, is the staple commodity of the country.
Three rivers meet close by the town, upon which fulling
mills, or other machinery might be erected to any extent,
and the raw material; every where around, can be procu-

which goods can be exported to any qaurter of the globe,
is only 14 miles distant.  Uniting so many advantages, the

in the manufacture of carpets, etc. particularly Galla-
shiells, the flockings and narrow cloths of which, by the
industry of a few individuals, are now arriving at great
perfection.  Exclusive of cloths, grocery, and other goods 
sold in the shops, wood, Welsh slate, tar, grease butter,
palm oil, (or African greese), are imported at Sarkfoot,
and sold in Langholm, to the amount of L. 4000 and up-
wards.  In short, there seems to be a spirit of industry and 
enterprise arising, which, if properly cherished, may ulti-
mately lead to the introduction of different manufactures,
particularly to that of the woollen, for which, every thing 
considered, Langholm, of all other places in Scotland, seems
best calculated.  This wished for event, so benefecial in its
consequences, as keeping money in the country, and gi-
ving bread to the natives, is not however to be accom-
plished, but by people of capital, and of professional skill.
Manufactures attempted, by associations of gentlemen a-
lone, who are themeselves ignorant of the business, and con-
