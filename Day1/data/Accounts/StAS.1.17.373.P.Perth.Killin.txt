sea-gulls, and wild geese, frequent the lakes and rivers.  The
cuckoo, swallow, and other migratory birds that are common
in the rest of the internal parts of the kingdom, pay their
annual visit here.  Some birds are found in this country,
which are reckoned rare; as the scaup-duck, the water-rail,
the ring-ouzel, the greater spotted wood-pecker, the nut-
hatch, the greater and lesser red-polls, etc.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate is various, but generally
moist and cold.  This is much owing to the particular situ-
ation of the parish.  The district of Breadalbane, in which
it lies, is one of the highest in Scotland, and farthest remo-
ved from the sea*; and as it abounds in high mountains,
the clouds, floating in the atmosphere, frequently break up-
on the tops of them, and fall down in rain through the val-
leys.  The snow, too, rests long upon the hills; and, owing
to there circumstances, the spring is generally late and cold.
But when summer commences, by the reflection of the sun
from the adjacent hills, the heat is much greater than in le-
vel countries, and vegetation advances with great rapidity.
The diseases that prevail most among the inhabitants are
such as are principally owing to the influence of climate, as
rheumatisms, pleurisies, etc.  The people are, in general,
however, very healthy, which is much owing to their sober
and industrious mode of living.  Seventy and eighty years is
not an uncommon age attained by them, and there have
been more than one instance of persons in the parish who
have outlived their 100dth year within the present century.

*The height of this country is intimated by its name, Braid-
Albainn being a Gaelic word, which signifies the highest part of
Scotland; and as an evidence of its height, it is to be observed,
that at Carn-drom, in the west end of the parish, the waters
divide, and run partly into the eastern, and partly into the wes-
tern sea.
