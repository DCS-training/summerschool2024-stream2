and winter, and plough it down in the spring, and by this
manure alone, I have seen good crops of bear raised on
poor outfield ground.  Perhaps, by raising a proper dike
along the natural course of the river, the tide might be
prevented from overflowing this space, and by this means
a valuable piece of ground might be gained to the pro-
prietor; the channel of the river might be deepened, and
rendered navigable to larger vessels.

   Produce and State of Improvements.-Oats and bear are
almost the only productions.  A few years ago, one of
the proprietors built a lint-mill, since which time, the in-
habitants have begun to cultivate flax; but as they are
not sufficiently acquainted with the proper mode of ma-
naging this useful crop, it is not yet cultivated to that ex-
tent to which it is to the hoped they will soon arrive.
Improvements in agriculture may be said to the here only
in their infancy.  From the easy access which the far-
mers have to lime, by means of the Ythan being navi-
gable, it has been used as a manure for more than 20
years pass; but for want of a proper check in the mode of
cropping, after using this manure, they at first rather ex-
hausted than improved their fields by it.  They are, how-
ever, beginning to see the impropriety of this practice;
but they still, for most part, take 3 crops of grain after
liming, then a green crop, either turnip or peas, and then
bear with grass seeds.  This mode of cropping, although
better than what was formerly adopted in this corner of
the country, would perhaps be reprobated by good far-
mers; but it is to be hoped, that in a few years, our far-
mers will be brought to crop their fields, in a manner less
hurtful to the soil, and more beneficial to their landlords
and themselves.  The shortness of the leases that are com-
