already noticed, but for the judicious counsel which he was at all
times ready to afford in the various arrangements by which its pro-

tance was obtained from Andrew Tawse, Esq. W.S., Treasurer to
the Society.
 The Committee have further to acknowledge the important aid
which, throughout the work, they derived from Professor Jameson,
in the department of Natural History. Nor can they omit to
record how deeply indebted in this matter, are the Society, th
Church of Scotland, and the country at large, to the enterprising
publishers, Messrs Blackwood; but for whose disinterested zeal
for the public good, and generous reliance on the ultimate suc-
cess of the undertaking, it may be truly said, it would not have
been attempted.
 The Manuscripts of all the Accounts, as originally transmitted
to the Committee, will be deposited among the Records of the
Church. Except in the few instances in which these have been
specially referred to, all that they contain of general interest or
value appears in the printed Accounts.
