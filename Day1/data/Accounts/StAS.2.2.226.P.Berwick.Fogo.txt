                         III.-POPULATION.
   The population of the parish, which, according to Dr Web-
ster's Account in 1755, was 566, has decreased about one-fourth.
This evidently arises from the common custom in this country
of uniting farms, one tenant possessing what was formerly occu-
pied by three or four. A few straggling ash-trees still point out
the seat of the former dwellings. If this change has diminished
the population, it has certainly improved and increased the produce
of the soil, which is now occupied by persons of capital and enter-
prise. The village of Fogo, the only one in the parish, scarcely
deserves the name, as it only consists of the manse and school-
house, and of six cottages attached to two farms. The population
at present may be considered as nearly stationary, varying a little,
acccording to the annual ingress or egress of farm-servants, with
their families.
