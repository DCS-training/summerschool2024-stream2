this parish are disposed to beg, either in this or neighbouring
parishes; but much is given away by the inhabitants in alms
to beggars which swarm from other places, especially from
manufacturing towns and villages.

   Minerals and Fuel.-This parish abounds in coal and lime-
stone.  The coal resembles that of Newcastle, caking toge-
ther, and making a strong fire, when properly put on, and al-
lowed to rest three or four hours before it be stirred.  It is
generally found in a stratum of from 3 to 4 1/2 feet thick, be-
tween two strata of lime-stones.  The upper stratum of lime-
stone is called the blue lime, and the lower the white lime,
which last has generally been esteemed of an inferior quality
to the blue.  These useful minerals, in places where there is
no great thickness of strata above them, are come at by re-
moving the superincumbent soil but where they lie deep,
the coal is wrought first by miners, and afterwards the up-
per or blue lime is separated from the roof by wedges or
gunpowder.  The coals are sold at the pit for 3 d. per hutch,
five of which may be drawn in a cart, by an ordinary horse,
and six by an able bodied horse.  The only coal in the pa-
rish wrought for fuel, is the property of Robert Dunmore,
Esq; of Ballindalloch, whose exertions for the improvement
of his own estate, and of the country in general, cannot be
mentioned with too much praise.  He works the lime also to
a very considerable extent.  Besides his, there are three other
limeworks going in the parish, but upon a smaller scale; and
there is lime-stone, more or less, through almost all the high
grounds.  In it are found petrified shells of a variety of kinds,
stimulating the conjectures of naturalists concerning the re-
volutions of this globe.  There is abundance of freestone of
a good quality for building, and a little iron-stone; but, at
the place where it hath been observed, the stratum is so thin
