but the success was not such as to tempt them to continue
their operations.  This river falls into the sea, in a channel
cut through a rock 20 feet high, by Lady Jane Gordon, Coun-
tess of Sutherland*.  Before this channel was cut, the course
of the Loth was eastward through the low grounds of Crakag
and Lothmore.  This river is very rapid, and sometimes im-
passable in speats; upon these occasions it is more formidable
to travellers than Helmsdale, because on the latter there is a
passage boat, whereas on the former there is no resource but
to encounter the stream.  A Caithness post was drowned in
attempting to cross it in 1755, and an excise officer's servant
perished in it in the same way soon afterwards.  There are
four rapid burns in the parish to the S. of Helmsdale, besides
the burn of the Ord to the N. of it; in the last a young man
and his wife perished in a speat, being carried down by the
stream over a high precipice, about 20 years ago.  The rivers
and burns abound in trout.  The road through the parish is
dry, and would answer well for travellers on horseback and
on soot, if there were bridges over those streams; but it is
not adapted for wheel carriages.

land gets two furrows and is manured, but that for its and
pease gets only one furrow without manure; so that the land
is manured every second year.  The ordinary manure, and what
answers best for bear is sea-ware, but it is believed to have lit-
