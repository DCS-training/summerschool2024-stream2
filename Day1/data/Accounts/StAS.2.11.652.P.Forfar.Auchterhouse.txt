George Millar of Templelands. The extent of the farms va-
ries from about 500 to 100 acres; and the rent from L. 1, 5s. to L. 2

	Improvements.--All the farms are inclosed and subdivided by
stone fences; and the farmers' houses and farm steadings, with
very few exceptions, are nearly new, and substantial, and commo-
dious. And, in proof of the liberality of the landlords, and of the in-
dustry and enterprise of the tenantry, it may be stated, that of the
extent of land at present under cultivation, nearly 500 acres have
been reclaimed, within these forty years, from moor, and moss, and
bog, and rendered sound productive soil. And there improve-
ments have been accomplished, either by the landlords themselves,
or by the tenants, encouraged by aid given them, directly or indi-
rectly, by the landlords, though opposed by deeds of entail in fa-
vour of heirs-male, restricting the leases on the Earl of Airlie's
estate to fourteen, and on the Earl of Camperdownis to nineteen
