toes 6 d. the peck, the peck holds 6 pints and 2 gill, the
brimful of which is half the potato peck*.

   Vegetables, etc.-In the vegetable productions, there is
nothing remarkable or peculiar, but that whins will not
grow, though broom does; small or bush-fruit answer well,
and is abundant, but tree-fruit does not, as the late frosts
generally destroy the blossom.  There are some mineral
springs, but of no repute.

   Birds.-Of the feathered tribe, the linnet and goldfinch
seldom appear here, though numerous along the coast.
The swan, a variety of fishing-ducks or duckers, and the
woodcock live here in winter, but retire in summer.
The sky and sandy larks, sea-magpie, lapwing, stonechatter,
swallow, cuckoo, bat, and night-hawk remain here during
the warm months, but disappear in winter; the 5 last are
believed to be sleepers.  In winter 1791, a bird appeared,
of the size and make of a linnet, entirely white; one of the
same kind was seen at Fort William in 1782, with a slock
of linnets.

   Curiosities.-The only curiosity is an artificial cave up-
on the estate of Raits, 2 miles from Pitmain, and within

*A farm servant has from L. 5 to L. 6 a-year of wages; a maid-servant
from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2.  When hired by the day, the man-servant gets 1 s.
without victuals, or 6 d with victuals; a woman 6 d. without victuals.
The price of wool washed is about 12 s. unwashed, 8 s. carred, 5 s. the
stone (24 lb. English).  The country sheep are of the whitefaced kind,
weighing about 8 lb. the quarter, and fell at 7 s. or 8 s.; by the intro-
duction of the blackfaced tups, the breed is greatly meliorated of late
years, but the wool is much coarser.  Most part of the inferior tenants
still house them for the benefits of their manure, whence they suffer se-
verely in spring.  They weap their lambs early, and milk the sheep, to
the great prejudice of both.
