     NUMBER XII.

     PARISH OF DAVIOT.

     (PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, COUNTY AND SYNOD
     OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr. Robert Shepherd.

     Extent, Surfece, and Soil.

   THE parish of Daviot, strictly so called, extends to about
3 1/2 miles in length, and 2 in breadth.  But several
lands in the parishes of Chapel and Fyvie, were, in the end of
last century, annexed to it, quoad sacra, by act of Assembly;
so that the whole, under the minister's cahrge, is nearly 5
miles in length and 4 in breadth.-The soil of the parish is
various, consisting partly of strong clay, partly of rich loam,
but in general fertile.  Its exposure is chiefly to the S. and
S. E. and there are few hills in the parish.

   Number of Inhabitants.-The return to Dr Webster in
1755, was 975 souls; the number of inhabitants in the pro-
per parish of Daviot is nearly 700, but in the whole parish
under the minister's charge, 900: of these, 40 are Episcopa-
lians.
