of the lambs he sells to a second class of farmers, who annu-
ally buy in lambs, and sell them all again next year as hogs
to the Highlanders.  A third class of farmers have a breed-
ing stock of ewes; of their lambs they keep just as many as
are sufficient to replace the breeding stock; the rest they sell
to the second class of farmers.  A few farmers keep a stock
of breeding ewes; they sell all their lambs fat to the butcher,
except what is necessary to keep up the breeding stock.  One
or two farmers who have low and improved land keep no
sheep through winter, but buy in ewes with lambs in March,
sell off the fat lambs in summer, and fatten the mothers on
grass, selling them at Martinmas, or feeding them still farther
on turnips.

   This last mode of farming is in its infancy at Linton.  It
was introduced by James McDougal in Linton, a very intel-
ligent man, who was 14 years with Mr Dawson at Frogden,
about the time he commenced his improvements, first as a
servant and then as an overseer.  He has been about 12 years
in a L. 50 farm at Linton.  Mr Laurence Tweedie, lately
come to the farm of Slipperfield near Linton, is adopting his
mode of culture.  He has an extensive sheep farm of the first
description, but brings down his supernnuated breeding
stock to be fed off on turnips on his low lands.  James
McDougal buys in his ewes in March with lamb; feeds off
the lambs on hill ground which has been laid down with
white clover.  The ewes which have missed lamb, and those
whose lambs were first sold off, as they grow fat on the grass,
are sold at Martinmas; the rest are brought down to the
turnip, and sold about the middle of January.  Before he
practiced feeding on the turnip, he sold all off at Martinmas,
and reckoned himself well paid if he cleared 5 s. a-head for
the lambs, and soft nothing by the ewes.  The turnip im-
