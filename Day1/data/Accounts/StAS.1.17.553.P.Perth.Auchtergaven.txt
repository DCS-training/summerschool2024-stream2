   State of the Poor, and their Funds.-The poor are not nu-
merous here, and are remarkably well provided for.  The
funds for their support arise from collections in the church,
money for mortcloths, dues on marriages and baptisms, the
rent of two losts in the church, and the rent of a few acres
of land belonging to the poor.  The whole amounts to about
261. Sterling per annum.  Out of this income, there is a dis-
tribution made, of supply to the poor, by the kirk-session,
every month.  There are generally 6 or 8 paupers upon the
list, who receive from 5 s. to 10 s. per month, according to
their necessities.  At an annual meeting of the kirk-session,
held in November, a few pounds are distributed in small
portions, for buying clothes, coals, or other necessaries, to
any poor people of the parish who chuse to apply for this as-
sistance, and who are known to stand in need of it.
