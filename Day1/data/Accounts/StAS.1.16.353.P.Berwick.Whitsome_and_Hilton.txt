     of Whitsom and Hilton.

   11.  On the north of Hilton, on Hilton-hill, lies Myre-
sides, well named from its low, marshy situation, divided
into two parts, one of them a feu of George Purves, con-
sisting of about 20 acres, supposed equal to L. 15; and a
small farm of about 40 acres, part of Mr Boswell's estate,
which pays L. 38 of rent to the proprietor, and L. 6 to an
old farmer for quitting it to the present tenant.

   12.  Immediately north of Myreside lies the farm of
Dykelhead, the soil much inferior to the soil of Hilton and
Tondinfield, and rented low accordingly at L. 132, part of
Mr Boswell's estate, as is likewise now French-Law, within
these few weeks purchased by him from a Mr Scott of
Alnwick, at nearly 40 years purchase, rather from its con-
tiguity to his other grounds, than its fertility, which is cer-
tainly, however, superior to Dykelhead; it is conjectured
to have got its name from the French, either as allies or
foes, having made a neighbouring eminence their station
while in this part of the country; the rent is L. 50.  To
the north of it lies Moorhouse, a very small detached piece.
of ground belonging to the same proprietor; the most
northerly, and the very worst soil in the parish.

   13.  North-west of Dykelhead and French-Law, the feu
of Leethead, belonging to Robert Chirnside, consists of 44
acres, most of it good fertile ground, well worth L. 1 Ster-
ling per acre.  Here rises Leet, which, inconsiderable as it
is, is the only stream which has obtained a name in this
parish; it is minutely described in the account of Swinton,
where it becomes more considerable.

   14.  Due east of Hilton-hill lies the large extensive farm
of Wynnefield, called so from Wynne Johnstone, Esq; its
late proprietor, and now the property of the Earl of
