formed by the parish.  It is neatly plastered and ceiled,
well lighted, paved in the areas, and regularly seated.  It
has a geometrical stair in each end, with galleries quite
round; and none are allowed to bury in it.  The plan has
been adopted by other parishes.

   Manse.-The manse and offices were completely rebuilt
and stated in 1790, and garden-walls built, of stone and
lime, for L. 321 : 18 : 3, out of the above mentioned vacant
stipends.  L. 101 : 8 : 7 of these stipends went to the pay-
ment of interim assistants, during the vacancy; and the rem-
nant, to other necessary purposes within the parish.-On
the 19th January 1795, a still fire broke out, near mid day,
with inextinguishable vehemence, in a room that had been
deafened with straw and shavings of wood, instead of clay,
whereby the manse, but not the offices, was rapidly consu-
med.  The walls remained entire, and the heritors com-
pletely repaired the dwelling house, for L. 170. 18 : 3, in
1795-6.

   Stipend, Glebes, and Patronage.-The living, which had
not been augmented since 1650, was made better in June
1795, by an addition of 16 bolls more barley, and about
L. 15 more money.  It stands now at 106 bolls 1 firlot bar-
ley, 7 bolls 2 firlots oat-meal, at 9 stones, with L. 40: 15 : 2
Sterling of money-stipend, and L. 5 more for communion-
elements.  There is a glebe of 6 acres at Dyke, and a small
one in the other parish, for which the proprietor of Moy
pays a rent of 6 bolls of barley.  The minister has L. 13
13 s. 4 d. for grass-money.  The living, with its accommo-
dations, according to preent prices, may be reckoned at
L. 150.
   The patronage has been lately declared a vice-right, be-
tween the Crown and the heritor of Easter Moy, Hugh
Grant, Esquire.
