is now very generally introduced into the plan of agricultural
improvement, apparently with as much success as any where
in the neighbourhood.-The number of farms amounts to
15, consisting entirely of arable land, let at a rent of from
15 s. to 1 L. 14 s. an acre.  In the present rage for monopo-
lising and uniting farms, the extent of these may be reckon-
ed small; they contain, in general, from 80 to 200 acres,
forming an aggregate of near 2000 acres.  Besides these,
there are several hundred acres laid out in constant pasture,
and in very thriving plantations.  Before quitting this article,
it may be proper to mention that the culture of turnips has
been lately introduced, and promises much success.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is 5608 L. 9 s. 11 d.
Scotch, paid by fix heritors; of whom only one, Lieutenant
General Fletcher, who possesses about two thirds of the pro-
perty, is resident.  Few instances occur in these days of dis-
sipation and luxury, of the possession of land being less fluc-
tuating than in this parish.  The estate of Salton has been
in possession of the Fletchers since the year 1643; and the
family from whom it was then purchased, the Abernethies of
Salton, had been proprietors thereof from the year 1249.
The estate of Herdmonston also affords another pleasing in-
stance, of the same kind, having been for centuries in the
possession of the present family.
