weather had been uncommonly variable, and changed from high
gusts of wind to a deep calm, a few day s before the severest
shocks of the earthquake. The air was moist and hazy, and
the clouds seemed charged with electricity. It is not impro-
bable, that these earthquakes arise from large caverns below
this place, into which the exterior waters penetrate, and are
converted into vapour, or steam, capable of the highest degree
of expansion, and must press forcibly upon every thing which
opposes their dilatation. By this theory the famous Delomica
accounted for the earthquakes of Calabria in 1783, which was
received, by the learned world, as more satisfactory than any
proposed by Sir William Hamilton, and other philosophers.
Whatever be the cause, the effect is certain; and it must be
no small force that can shake a country to the extent of be-
