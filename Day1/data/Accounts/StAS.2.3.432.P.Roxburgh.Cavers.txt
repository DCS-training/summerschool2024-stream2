     Dr John Leyden, so eminetly distiguished by the poetical ge-
nius which he displayed, and the classical knowledge which he ac-
quired in so short a life, was born at the village of Denholm, in
this parish, in September 1775, of parents humble in their rank
and circumstances of life, but eminent for thier moral and
intelligence. He entered the University of edinburgh in 1790,
and in due course was licensed to preach the gospel as probation-
er in the Church of Scotland. Ambitious, however, of still high-
er attainments in literature and science than he had yet achieved,
he sahortly after this entered upon the study of medicine, with a
view of going abroad, chiefly in order that he might procure op-
portunities of enchancing his acquirements in the oriental languages,
and thereby gratifying the passion which reigned supreme in his
heart. Through the patronage of the Right Honourable Wil-
liam Dundas, he was appointed assistant-surgeon in the hospital
of Madras, but in which situation he did not long continue. After
holding the situation of assistant-surgeon in Mysore Survey,
and a professorship in the College of Bengal, he eventually, under
the patronage of Lord Minto, the then Governor-General on
the expedition to Java, made for the purpose of investigating the
manners, languages, and literature of the tribes of that island, and
for which Leyden's extensive knowledge of the estern dialects and
customs, eminetly qualified him. There he was seized with
fever, and this extraordinary man, in whom were combined such
virtues, learning and genius, and withal such athletic powers and
activity, as are never, or very rarely to be met with in one indivi-
dual, after three days illness, died ont he eve of the battle which
gave Java to the British Empire.
     John Armstrong of gilknockie, the famous border freebooter,
along with a number of his companions, was by order of king
James V., executed at Caelanrig, and interred there, in or near
by the chapel burial-ground. *

<FOOTNOTE>This individual, by harrassing and plundeing his neighbours on the English bor-
ders,appears,in carrying forward his predatory adventures, to have acted principally
upon,the mistaken notion of his being his country's eminent benefactor; and his
kindred and Scottish neighbours seem to have encouraged this notion to the utmost
in esteeming him hihgly as such: King James, however, having sworn that the
would "mark the tresh-buss keep the cow," thought very differntly, and all the
maraduer's entreaties and proffered the Prince to preserve his life. A number of his
companious were carried to Edinburgh as hostages for insuring the better behaviour
of their friends left behind on the border ; but nothing at this time could chain down
