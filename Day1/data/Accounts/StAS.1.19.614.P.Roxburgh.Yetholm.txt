   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 7049: 13: 4
Scots.  The real rent is about L. 2104 Sterling.  It may
with propriety be said to be three times more than it was
during the remembrance of some old people yet living.

   Stipend.-Till lately the stipend was no more than 13 1/2
bolls oat-meal, 14 1/2 bolls barley, 5 bolls wheat, all in Te-
viotdale measure, and L. 38: 17: 9 4/12 in money, besides
L. 1: 13: 4 for communion-elements.  An augmentation
was lately granted of 2 chalders of oat-meal, Linlithgow
measure, and L. 2: 6: 8 for communion-elements.  But af-

augmented before, he may be justified in pronouncing it too

   School.-The salary belonging to the parochial school is
100 merks Scots.  The master is furnished with a good
school-house and dwelling-house.  There are two or three
private schools, for the accommodation of the inhabitants.
The number of scholars may be about 80.

   Poor-The number of poor upon the roll is usually about
30, who receive from 2 s. 6 d. to 8 d. per week each, as
their necessities may require.  Besides the stated poor, some
needy families receive occasional supply.  The funds for
answering these purposes arise chiefly from assessments.
