     Statistical Account

   Manufactures, Mills, etc.-The principal branches of ma-
nufacture carried on in the parish are spinning and weaving.
The women spin with both hands.-Besides the flax raised
in the parish, considerable quantities of foreign flax are spun;
and the yarn is either wove in the parish and neighbourhood,
or sent to Dundee.  Considerable quantities of household
cloth are wove here, and about 50,000 yards of yard-wides,
part of which is bleached in the neighbouring parish of Rat-
tray; but a greater proportion is sold in the village of Blair-
Gowrie, and sent green to London.  There are 7 meal mills,
2 lint mills, and 1 fulling mill in the parish.  The rate of
multure paid at the meal mills, is, in general, about a twelfth
part of what is ground.

   Cattle.-A good number of horses are reared in the parish.
They are of very different sizes and value.  A considerable
proportion of them are very good draught horses, but a still
greater proportion are small and ill kept.  The former kind
are worth from 15 l. to 25 l. each; the latter, from 8 l. to
12 l.  Many black cattle are also reared in the parish.  Those
in the northern district are very small, but they are consi-
derably larger in the other.  Great numbers are sold out of
the parish, when 3 or 4 years old, particularly of the stots.
The stock of sheep is much diminished.  They are mostly
of the white-faced kind, of a very small size, and are sold at
from 6 s. to 9 s. a-piece.  Their wool sells at about 14 s. per
stone.  From 8 to 10 fleeces go to a stone.  Too little atten-
tion is paid to this valuable animal in this parish.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-A boll of oat meals weigh-
ing 8 stones, sells, at an average, at from 14 s. 8 d. to 16 s.;
a boll of wheat at 20 s.; barley at 15 s.; oats at 13 s.; and
pease at 13 s. 4 d.  Beef, mutton, and pork, are sold at from
