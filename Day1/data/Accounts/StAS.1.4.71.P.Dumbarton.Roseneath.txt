     NUMBER IX.

     PARISH OF ROSENEATH.

     (COUNTRY OF DUNBARTON.)

     By the Rev Mr GEORGE DRUMMOND.

     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   THE ancient name of the parish was Rossnacboich,
which is a Gaelic word signifying the "Virgin's
"Promontory."  The parish is situated in the most westerly
part of Dunbarton-shire, in the Synod of Glasgow and 
Air.  It is a peninsula, nearly in the form of parallelo-
gram, being about 7 miles long and 2 broad, and is bounded 
on the land-side towards the N. by the parish of Row, on 
the W. by Lochlong, on the S. by the frith of Clyde, and 
on the E. by Gairloch.  It is a continued ridge of rising 
ground, whitout any high hill or mountain, although some 
parts of it are rocky.  The higher grounds are covered
with heath; but the lands near the shore are green.  The 
soil is various, part of it being fertile, and part barren;
part of it deep, and part shallow.  The air is naturally 
dry, but is frequently moistened with showers.  It is in ge-
neral healthy.  There are several small rivulets; but, from 
the situation of the parish, no large rivers.  We have a lake 
of about a mile in circumference, that abounds with perch.
