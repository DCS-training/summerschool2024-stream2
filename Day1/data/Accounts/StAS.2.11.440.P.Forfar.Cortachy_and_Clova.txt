Grasses on the pasture grounds: Where the land is good and dry,

        Plantations.-There are several plantations in the united pa-
rish, which have been for the most part formed in the course of
the last twenty-seven years. Some of these plantations are in
mountainous districts. One of the largest thus situated contains
about 500 acres, and another about 150 acres. The other planta-
tions are generally situated in the lower grounds, particularly along
the banks of the South Esk and Prosen rivers. These planta-
tions are all thriving very well. They are already useful in many
respects, and give a new and highly improved appearance to the
rural scenery. The trees which have been planted in the moun-
tainous districts are larch, spruce, and Scotch fir. The lower
grounds are planted with oak and various other kinds of hard-wood,
together, with a mixture of larch and other firs. In the grounds
around  the Castle of Cortachy, there are a great many fine tall
trees, upwards of one hundred years old, consisting of various kinds,
