the heritors. We wish we could say there is any thing like a ge-
neral disposition among the poor to refrain from seeking parochial
relief. With one or two honourable exceptions, the reverse, we
regret to say, is the true state of the case.
   Fairs.-Cockburnspath fair is said to have been at one time a
market of some importance. Now the principal commodities ex-
posed to sale are gingerbread, and a few toys for children. It
holds on the second Tuesday of August.
   Inns.-There are three licensed inns or public-houses, besides
a toll-bar, and a shop in the village licensed to sell spirits. The
two last might well be spared; for, although we do not mean to
say that the inhabitants of this parish are more addicted to intem-
perate habits than their neighbours in other places, yet the increas-
ing number of such houses, and the readiness with which licenses
are granted, cannot be viewed without alarm by all who wish well
both to the temporal and spiritual interests of the people.
   Fuel.-The general fuel is coal, but wood and pears are both,
used to a considerable extent, especially by the poorer classes.
The coal used is principally brought by sea, either to the Cove
harbour in this parish, or to that of Skate raw, in the adjoining pa-
rish of Innerwick. The nearest coal wrought is on the other side
of Berwick-upon-Tweed, more than twenty-two miles distant,  In-
cluding carriage, &c. coals cost in this parish, according to the
quality, from 9d. to 1s. per cwt.
