     PARISH OF RAFFORD,

     (SYNOD OF MORAY, COUNTY OF ELGIN, AND PRESBYTERY
     OF FORRES.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM STEPHEN, Minister.

     Name.

   IN the course of time, the name of this parish has under-
gone some variation.  About the beginning of the 13th
century, in a charter from Pope Innocent to Bricius bishop
of Moray, it is denominated Ecclesia de Ruffus.  How long
this had been the received orthography, seems not very
clear, but from the commencement of our presbyterial
record in 1651, I find it written, at successive periods, Raf-
fart, Raffard, and for about 60 years back, almost invari-
ably Rafford.  Being no adept, however, in the ancient
Celtic or Gaelic languages, I will hazard no conjecture a-
bout its true etymology.
