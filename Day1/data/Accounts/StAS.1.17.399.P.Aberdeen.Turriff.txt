     of Turreff.

   The present school-house was the Episcopal Chapel in 1745,
when a party of the Duke of Cumberland's army demolish-
ed the seats and pulpit, and were prevented from setting fire
to the house itself by the intercession of Mr Andrew Ker,
who was thcn minister of this parish.
   About the beginning of last century, in compensation, it is
supposed of some privileges of which the feuers and inhabi-
tants of Turreff had been deprived about the time of the
Reformation, Lord Errol settled an yearly salary of 100 L.
Scotch, and 1 1/2 acre of land, for the maintenance of a school-
master to teach their children.  This salary has been regu-
larly paid by the proprietors of Delgaty, who have the right
of presenting to the office.  As none of the other heritors
contribute in any manner to its support, the school cannot
be denominated parochial.  As session-clerk, the schoolmas-
ter receives an annual salary of 2 L. 4 s 5 d.; for registering
a baptism 10 d. of which the kirk officer gets one third;
and for proclaiming a purpose of marriage, 20 d. of which
the kirk officer likewise gets one third, when the bride re-
sides in the parish.  The school is at present attended by 30
scholars, who are taught to read English at the rate of 2 s.
and Latin and arithmetic at 2 s 6 d. per quarter.
   About the year 1727, Mr William Meston, formerly one
of the professors of the Marischal College, but obliged to
give up that place in 1715, on account of his political princi-
ples, commenced an academy in Turreff, for instructing
young gentlemen in such sciences as were then taught in the
universities.  This academy, which was quite unconnected
with the school, continued to flourish for several years.  In
an account of the life of Mr Meston, prefixed to his poems,

demy, viz. Mr Gordon of Embo, and Mr John Grant of
