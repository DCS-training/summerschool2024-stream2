   Within these few years there has sprung tip a village in the pa-
rish, named Lumsden, of which the population at this time is 243.
The creation of this village has led to the sudden increase of the
population, by attracting individuals, who resort to it from all parts
of the country.  At present there is something of a counterba-
lancing decrease in the population, by the disposition to emigrate,
which for two seasons has prevailed, especially among the young
men.

                           IV.-INDUSTRY.
   These parishes have never been entirely surveyed, and, conse-
quently, their precise arable extent cannot be stated; but it is pro-
gressive both in measure and in manner; both in the reclaiming
of land heretofore barren, and in an improved style of operation.
The appearance, comfort, and substantiality of the houses and
cottages are much improved within the last twenty years.
   Leases.-The usual duration of the leases on good farms is
nineteen years; on farms more pastoral than in tillage, seven,
nine, and eleven years.
   The people are almost all employed in agriculture and the
rearing of cattle.  In Lumsden village there are a few traders
and handicraftsman; and blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, and
tailors, are distributed through the different estates; but the mass
of the population is agricultural, and the people are sober, frugal,
and industrious in their habits.

    			V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Market-Town.-The nearest market-town, with the exception
of the village of Rhynie, is Huntly, distant at an average twelve
miles.  The road is turnpike, and excellent from the church on-
wards.  this turnpike runs in whole about seven miles through
the parish.  There is a stage-coach which passes through the pa-
rish to and from Aberdeen on every alternate day.
