some distance, was formerly barren heath, swamps, or marsh,
there is now scarcely one uncultivated spot to be seen; and
barley, oats, lint, potatoes, and turnips, are produced in a-
bundance, where nothing grew before.  This spirit of im-
provement and manufacture was first introduced by a few
who dealt in the yarn trade.  From their laudable example,
and from observing the profits arising from industry, others
were encouraged; and now it is become one of the first vil-
lages in the North, both in point of population and manufac-
tures.  Being situated in the midst of a large and fertile coun-
try, the industrious inhabitants have a ready sate for what
they bring to market, by which many poor cottagers and sub-
tenants are enabled to pay for their scanty possessions.

   Prices of Labour and Provisions.-The advanced price of
all the necessaries of life makes wages high in proportion.
The common hire of a ploughman is from 7 L. to 8 L. yearly,
of a day-labourer from 8 d. to 10 d. or 1 s., according to the
work he is hired for, and his skill in doing it.  A mason's
wages are 1 s. 3 d. a-day; a wright's and slater's the same, when
the work is not undertaken by private bargain.-The price
of provisions, of all kinds, has been greatly advanced of late
years; that of fish, in particular, has increased.  Haddocks,
formerly sold for 5 d. or 6 d. the dozen, now sell for 7 d. 9 d. and
even sometimes 1 s. 6 d. the half dozen.  The best beef sells at
3 1/2 d. and 4 d. the pound; and mutton from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. the
quarter.

   Rent and Proprietors.-The real rent of the parish is
about 1700 L.  Sterling, and the valued rent about 2600 L.
Scotch.  The Duke of Gordon is proprietor of the whole
parish, excepting a haugh of land in the N. end of Kinore,
which belongs to Mr. Gordon of Avochy.
