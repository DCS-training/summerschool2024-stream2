     Statistical Account of the

   Principal Anderson.-John Bisset became Principal after
William Hay, but resigned his office, at the end of six years,
in favour of Alexander Anderson, who was Principal at the
time of the Reformation.  Principal Anderson's learning is
commended, and his spirit in defending the edifice from a
mob of reformers, whose purpose was to have stripped it of
the leaden roof and the bells, in the same manner as they
had treated the cathedral.  But perceiving, afterwards, that
the whole Roman Catholic establishment was going to wreck,
and from the hatred he bore to the reformed religion, he ali-
enated some of the college revenue, destroyed several of its
charters, whereby many of the lands and rents of the hos-
pital of St. Germains were quite lost; and sold the orna-
ments, books and furniture belonging to the College.  In
1569 he was expelled by the commissioners of visitation, to-
gether with all the other members, on account of their ad-
herence to Popery.

   Principal Arbuthnot.-The Regent Earl of Murray was
personally present, and bestowed the office of Principal on
Mr Alexander Arbuthnot, whose character stands very high
for learning and worth, and the influence which he possessed
among his contemporaries.  In his time the revenue of the
College received considerable additions, particularly the
tithes belonging to the deanry and sub-chantery of Aberdeen,
which were bestowed by King James VI. and which now
constitute the principal part of its remaining income.

   Nova Fundatio.-In the year 1578, visitors were appoint-
ed, by authority of Parliament, for new-modelling the state
of the three Scotch Universities; and in 1592 the nova fun-
datio of King's College was drawn up, in name of the profes-
sors, and received the ratification of Parliament in 1597.-
