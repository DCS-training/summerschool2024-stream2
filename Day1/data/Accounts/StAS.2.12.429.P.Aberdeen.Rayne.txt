the farms, from that of two horses labour to that of six-horses;
besides which, are numerous small crofts for tradesmen keeping a
cow, and other possessions, of eight, twelve, and twenty acres, oc-
cupied in lease by industrious tenants, labouring with their own
hands, and usually tilling with a horse and ox yoked together.  These
multiplied subdivisions of the ground, into portions so small, may
no doubt be adverse to the adopting of new and improved modes
of culture, on a large and uniform scale; but this disadvantage
has long appeared to the writer, to be counterbalanced by the
powerful encouragement thereby afforded to the practice of honest
industry and prudence, among the labouring classes of the com-
munity.  In counties that are under a different management, and
which have no gradation of possessions betwixt the cottars acre
and the grain farm of 100 acres, or the sheep farm of 1000 acres,
the man who begins life as a farm-servant, day-labourer, or trades-
man, how diligent and economical soever he may be, is almost
precluded from the hope of bettering his condition, by the occu-
pancy of a small farm, suited to his means and industry, and must
limit his views to the cottar's croft, realizing, in most instances
the English adage, "once a hind, always a hind".  But in Aber-
deenshire, which has been sometimes called "the poor mans coun-
try," a farm-servant or labourer, after having established his cha-
racter by activity, temperance, and economy, has little difficulty in
getting a possession proportioned to the amount of his savings, on
which, by exertion and foresight, he may live comfortably, and
bring up a family, in the like industrious, penaceable, and inde-
pendent way.  And, in proof of the efficiency of this stimulus,
there are at present within the bounds of this small parish, many
instances of persons, who, from very humble beginnings, have gra-
dually risen, by their own exertions, to be thriving and intelligent
agriculturists.  And though the small possessions are proportion-
ally higher rented than the large ones, they have always more
competitors for occupying them; and if there be less capital in-
vested, in cumulo, for carrying an expensive improvements, (which
is doubtful), there are more of the necessary sinews of industry
employed in comparison, and much more caution, sobriety, and
contentment, exercised in bad seasons, which tend to secure equal
and regularly paid rents to the land-owners, consequently, on well-
managed estates in this place, arrears of rent are of rare occu-
rence, and small amount.
   The leases are usually granted for nineteen years; and as wheat
