in a process of this kind, without public aid, by which
he has hitherto not profited; and therefore judged it
more eligible for himself to put up with his present situa-
tion, than involve himself in a law-suit, which might be
attended with an expence far above his circumstances to
bear.  It may almost indeed be looked upon as a problem
why the manse should be placed at such a distance from
the places of worship.  In answer to this, prior to, and
during the incumbency of Mr William Blaw, who was or-
dained to this charge some time after the Revolution, there
was one of the places of worship only one mile distant from
the manse.  But this house was suffered to go to ruin in
the time of Mr Blaw's incumbency, and was never after
repaired or rebuilt to any of the present incumbent's two
predecessors.  For a considerable time there was only one
place of worship in the island of Westray, and this too be-
coming ruinous in the last incumbent's time, the heritors
at last thought of building a centrical church for the whole
island; but however beneficial to the heritors, minister, and
people, this scheme was entirely dropped, and upon this the
heritors resolved to have two places of worship as formerly,
to the great inconveniency both of the minister and people.
