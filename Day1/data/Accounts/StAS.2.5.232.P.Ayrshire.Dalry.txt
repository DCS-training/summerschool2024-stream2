portion of the dip still remains to work. Furnaces have been
erected at this pit for the burning of coke. The Swinridgemuir
pits are in the same coal-field with this last. They are about thirty
fathoms deep; the seam is about five feet thick. There is a pit
at Coal-burn, and a small one at Cleaves. There is a pit also at
Hillend of Pitcon, and another was sunk last year in the Earl of
Glasgow's farm of Ryesholm. The coals are in general of excel-
lent quality. The most valuable quarries in the parish are those of
limestone. In addition to the limestone which many farmers burn
for themeselves, there are three public lime-works. The most ex-
tensive of these is at Howrat, on the Largs road. At Highfield and
Auldmuir, limestone is raised and burned in considerable quantities.
The lime is sold at the kilns at 1s. 3d. and 1s. 6d. per boll of five
bushels. The boll is merely nominal, as no measure is used,-
but an ordinary cart, which may contain sixteen bushels of un-
slacked lime, is considered as holding two bolls.

as can be ascertained, is as follows:-

   Although considerable pains have been taken to ascertain the
amount of raw produce, by a personal survey of each farm, the
result is given with much doubt.

  Manufactures.-Weaving is the principal manufacture in Dalry.
The number of weavers is 500, of whom 61 are females, and 104
are apprentices. They are chiefly employed in silk and harness
weaving, for the Paisley and Glasgow manufacturers. In general,
the present rate of wages in Dalry would afford the weaver a fair
remuneration for his labour, if he were constantly employed. The
intelligence and enterprise of the weavers of Dalry prevented
them from suffering, what, but for these qualities, they would have
done on the depression occasioned to the cotton weaving by the
