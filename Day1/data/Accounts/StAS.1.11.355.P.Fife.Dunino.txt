and many of them long-lived, furnish no instances of remark-
able longevity.

   Minerals and Mineral Waters.-Coal seems, from the vast
number of old pits in various places of the parish, to have,
some time ago, been a very plentiful article here.  There
is still, it is said, plenty of it in several estates of this disrict;
but it is uncertain when any of its proprietors will open these
mines, or rather, whether their future gains would compen-

also found in much abundance; but, though of an easy access,
and of a tolerable good quality, it is seldom called for beyond
the limits of the parish.  The erection and reparation of en-
closures, particularly on Sir William Erskine's estate of Deni-
no, and the building of his tenants substantial premises, are the
chief uses to which it has hitherto been, and is still occasion-

the parish, where ochre is found, particularly at a number of
chalybeate springs.  Between 30 and 40 years ago, these
were much resorted to, for relief in disorders, chiefly scorbutic
but of late they have lost much of their former celebrity,
though, to all appearance, very undeservedly.

   Curiosities.-Towards the S. W. end of the parish of De-
nino, there is a most remarkable fall of water, of probably
near 20 feet, from the shelve of the rock to the common sur-
face of the very deep pond, into which, among a vast number
of the sinny race, (and which, according to the conjectures of
the inhabitants, forms the boundary of their journeying up-
wards,) it pours almost perpendicularly.  This fall, from some
ludicrous, but perhaps natural, analogies, has, for time im-
