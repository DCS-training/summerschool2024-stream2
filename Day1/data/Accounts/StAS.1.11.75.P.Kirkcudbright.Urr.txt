   Some people (but very few) are disposed to give less wages,
and to put up with more indifferent servants, than the above
rates of hire would procure; but such economy seldom proves
advantageous.  In a word, there are few counties in Scotland,
where the labouring poor have less cause of complaint, than
in the stewartry of Galloway; and it must be owned, that
they are honest, happy and contented accordingly.  Mechanics
in general work by the piece; their gains, therefore, in a
daily sense, cannot be precisely ascertained.  Tailors, indeed,
work mostly by the day: Their wages are 8d., with victuals.

   Manufactures, etc.-Only one manufacture has been hither-
to established in Urr.  It is that of paper.  The necessary
machinery and repositories were erected at Dalbeaty, on the
the estate of Alexander Copland, etc. some years ago.  This
work has prospered abundantly.  Indeed it is conducted by
the proprietor of the paper mill; a person so prudent, so intel-
ligent, and sober, that it is believed, few concerns would go
wrong with him.  There is also a lint mill at Dalbeaty,
which is well conducted, and has its full share of what busi-
ness the country affords in that branch.  This vicinity, how-
ever, and the west of Scotland in general, seem by no means
fo fit for the growth of flax, as the eastern districts are.  The
copious rains that fall it: Galloway render it one of the best
counties in Britain, for rearing and feeding cattle.  Even when
unexpected and severe droughts happen, (nor is this seldom
the case), the abundace of excellent springs make consider-
able amends for the hardship.  But as the heavy rains are a
disadvantage in the rearing of flax, the droughts, in a light and
dry soil, are the destruction of this commodity.  In this pa-
rish, therefore, it is not probable the culture of it will increase,
whilst grain pays the farmer at the present rate.  The absurd
custom of fixing a rate of wages, at which servants and other
