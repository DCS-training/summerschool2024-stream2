     Statistical Account

parish amount to 370; the females to 380, which makes the
whole number of the inhabitants 750.  Of these, none reside
in towns of villages, there being none in the parish, except that
of Libberton, which scarcely deserves the name of a village, as
it only consists of a few scattered huts.
   From 1783,(the time when the tax, imposed by parliament,
on births and burials, commenced,) the records of this session
have been; kept with great accuracy: and from them it is found,
that the births, from October, 1783, to October, 1790,
were 122; the annual average of which is nearly 17 1/2.  The
deaths, for the same period, were 98; the annual average of
which, is 14.  The marriages for the same time, were 29;
the annual average of which, is a little more than 4.
   Of the 750 souls in this parish, there are 109 below 10; 130
from 10 to 20, 280 from 20 to 50, 199 from 50 to 70,
and 22 from 70 to 100.
   The number of prosessed farmers, in the parish, amount to
40.  But several of these, have only the half, and some only
the quarter of a plough.  With their children and servants,
they amount to 198.-There are 6 apprentices in the parish;
-100 labouring servants, male and female;-1 student at the
University of Edinburgh;-1 surgeon;-the Seceders, of all
denominations, amount to 98.
   From the facts, which have been already stated, respecting
the annual average of births, from 1683, to 1753, it appears,
with all the force of demostration, that the population of
this parish has decreased very near a half.  It is evident, from

rith of Libberton, was in the decline of life, and totally unable to
take an actual survey of it.  When the Doctor therefore applied
to him, he feat his examination roll, which only contained those a-
bove 8 years of age.  This the clerk of the parish, who has lived 
in it all his days, perfectly remembers.
