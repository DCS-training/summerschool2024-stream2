     NUMBER VII.

     PARISH OF KEIR.

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF DUMFRIES, PRESBYTERY OF PEN-
     PONT.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES WALLACE.

     Extent, Soil and Rivers.

   This parish is about 8 miles long from E. to W.  The
breadth is unequal; about 2 1/2 miles, or near 3 on an
average.  The soil is, in general, light, dry, and fertile, with
a sandy, gravelly bottom, and produces heavy crops of grain
and grass, in wet showery seasons, but is greatly parched, and
far less productive in hot dry seasons.  There is some holm
land on the banks of the Nith and Scarr, consisting of a deep
rich loam, and produces fine crops in any season.  The land
that lies highest and nearest the hilly ground, is, in general,
excepting the holms, the deepest and strongest, but so full of
stones, as to render the cultivation of it difficult and expen-
sive.  More than a third part of the parish consists of hilly
ground, or sheep-walks, mostly covered with short heath, in
