   The exact number of persons, of each opinion in this pa-
rish, has been already shown by the table.
   These other meetings-houses, however, besides accommo-
dating the inhabitants of this parish, also accommodate ma-
ny hearers who come from the neighbouring parishes.  Many
of these hearers come regularly every Lord's day, 8, 10, and
even 14 miles, to hear their own minister.  These people,
male and female, travel, when the roads are bad, bare-foot
and bare-legged, with their shoes and stockings in their
hands:  so much regard have they for the word, to hear it
preached in its purity and simplicity.

   Character and Manner of Living.-They, in general, are
active and industrious:  they are naturally generous and so-
cial, and very fond of news.  Drunkenness in this parish
is entirely unknown.  They are very orderly and decent
people; and crimes of any consequence are seldomer com-
mitted here than in many parishes in Scotland of equal po-
pulation.

   Religious Character.-The religious character of the in-
habitants of this parish is various, according to their sect.
Those of the Establishment neither run into the extreme of
superstition on the one hand, nor of fanaticism on the other,
but are of the calm, moderate, and mild cast, making no
great noise or bustle about it, though they are very regular
in attending to its institutions.
   The Seceders, in general, are very quiet and peaceable,
and live in good understanding with those of a different
persuation.  Upon the whole, the inhabitants attend re-
gularly upon divine ordinances, both of a common, or of
a more extraordinary nature; and there are few families
who do not keep up the worship of God in their houses,
