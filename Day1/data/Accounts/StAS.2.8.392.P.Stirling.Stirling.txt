bey.  In summer, or rather towards the beginning and during the
earlier part of autumn, the temperature is occasionally very high,
but seldom steady for more than a week or ten days at a time.
Indeed, the changes between heat and cold, and wet and dry wea-
ther, are great and frequent, and often very sudden through-
out the year.
   Through the kindness of a gentleman residing here, who has
kept an accurate register for some years, I am enabled to furnish
the following tabular information, which I have deduced from his
papers.
   Atmospheric pressure.--The following table shows the range of
the barometer for every month of 1839 and 1840:--
