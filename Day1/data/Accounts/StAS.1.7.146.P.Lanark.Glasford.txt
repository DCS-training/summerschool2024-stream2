draining the water.  The site seems to have been chosen in
turbulent times; for, except a narrow neck of land that leads
to the church, and a little garden, now pretty well drained,
the manse and offices are completely surrounded with a
morass.  It is therefore not difficult to conceives that, if ne-
cessary, the manse might, at small expence, be made a place
of considerable strength.
   The schoolmaster's salary is 100 merks.  He has a teach-

within these 40 years past: The schoolmaster's condition, du-
ring that long period, has undergone no material change for
the better.  The plowman serves one master only: The
schoolmaster has commonly as many dictators as employers.
The former receives his wages from one hand, and these
wages are chearfully and punctually paid: The latter, with
