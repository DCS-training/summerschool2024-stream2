         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE word Bothkennar is of Celtic origin, and signifies
the small arable fen or marsh,-a name highly descriptive of the
situation of the parish, which is very small, all arable, and appears
at first to have been marshy, from having been made tip from the
alluvial deposits of the Frith of Forth.
   Extent, &c-It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Airth;
on the east, by the Frith of Forth ; on the South, by the river Car-

   Geology.-There are no useful minerals in the parish, with the
exception of coal of the best quality, which is wrought to a great
extent by the Carron Company, and for which they pay the land-
ed proprietors L. 1000 a-year.
   Soil.-It consists of the richest loam, and, as a proof that the
parish has been, at one time, all under water, beds of shells and
other marine productions are found in almost every part of it, from
two to twelve feet under the surface.

                  II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Land-owners.-There are eighteen landed proprietors, all of
them non-resident, except three. The Earl of Zetland holds con-
siderubly more than one-third of the parish ; and the family has
been always distinguished as liberal and indulgent to their te-
