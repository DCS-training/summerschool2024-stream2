There is a spring in Rossie, strongly impregnated with iron;
which is drank, and it is said, with good effect, by persons
of relaxed habits.

   Tides and Fisheries.-The course of the tide, on this coast, is
north and south, the flood coming from the north.-In
this parish, there are two pretty large fishing villages, Ferry-
den and Usan: the first, contains about 38 families, and the
other 20; all of whom are fishermen, or persons connected
with them.  Those of Ferryden employ fix boats, 4 men to
each boat; and, in the summer season, 3 barks for the coal
trade.  The fishermen of Usan have 3 boats, and 6 men to
each boat.  Last war, about 24 men from these villages, and
the rest of the parish, served on board his Majesty's navy, and
a few in the army.-The fish caught on the coast are cod,
ling, haddocks, skate, slounders, and turbot.  There is also
great abundance of mussels, lobsters, and crabs.  The com-
mon price of white fish here, may be calculated at 3 sarthings
per pound.  The salmon fishings on the Southesk, belonging
to two proprietors in this parish, were formerly very produc-
tive.  Those of Rossie, some seasons, yielded 10,000 salmon,
and grilses; but, since the year 1781, they have fallen off
greatly.  The barrel of salmon sold, 20 years ago, for about
3 guineas, and the fresh salmon for 2s. per Dutch stone; but,
of late, the prices have increased to near double.-A few
years ago, a quantity of oysters were brought from the Firth
of Forth, and put down in a place where they were likely to
breed.  But, there is some reason to suspect, though the point
is not yet ascertained, that oysters cannot thrive in the neigh-
bourhood of mussels.

   Progress of Improvement.-About 60 years ago, this parish
was, in a great measure, open, scarcely a single field being
