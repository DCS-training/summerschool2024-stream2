lent Lord Chief Justice Holt, who, in his court of King's
bench, ordered the speaker of the House of Commons, with
a committee at his back, to take himself away, otherwise he
would commit him to Newgate, though he should have the
whole House of Commons in his belly.  It is the peculiar
glory of this nation, that the laws are, as they ought always
to be, predominant over every other power, superior to the
executive; and to any individual branch of the Legislature.
