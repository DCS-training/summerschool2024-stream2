     of Campsie.

   It is bounded on the North, by the parish of Fintry; on
the West, by Srathblane and Baldernock; on the South by
Calder and Kirkintilloch; and on the East by Kilsyth; form-
ing a distinct commissariot along with Hamilton, stiled the
commissariot of Hamilton and Campsie.
   It is presumed, that the winding appearance of the strath
in general, and particularly of the glens near which the pa-
rish church is situated, has given rise to the name Campsie,
or Camsi, which, in the Celtic language, is said to signify
crooked Strath or Glen.-Of course, the Clachan of Camp-
sie, is, the place of worship of the crooked glens.
   Indeed, if we attend carefully to the appearance which this
district presents to those who view it from any of the neigh-
bouring stations, particularly the bending of the hills in the
form of an amphitheatre, above the village of Clachan, from
which five streams, pouring down from five winding glens,

Campsie, in its original state, was eleven English miles long, from West
to East; its breadth varied on the West march, from Calder house to the
East's seat, it was at least nine English miles; whereas on the East march, its
breadth was scarcely six.
   It contained 150 plough gates of land and was valued at 9670 pounds
Scots.  It may be oberved that Campsie is situated in the Lennox, and for-
merly made the eastern division of that ancient territorial thaneship.  In the
year 1649, the Lords Commissioners for Valuation of Teinds, disjoined all
that part which lay betwixt Inch-Wood Burn and the Garrel Glen on the
East, annexing it to the parish Monniabrugh, now better know by the name
of Kilsyth, which portion contained 30 plough gates of land, and is rated at
2000 pounds Scots valution.  In like manner they disjoined all that portion
on the South West, which is situated betwixt Balgrochan and the Brawzyet
Burn, annexing it to the parish of Baldernock, containing 21 plough gates of
land, and valued in the county books at 1241 pounds Scots.  These two dis-
junct portions will no doubt be described by the ministers of the respective
parishes to which they belong.
