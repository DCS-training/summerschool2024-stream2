This manufacture commenced about the year 1770, and has
since been carried on with varying success.  From the year
1783 to 1789, it was a flourishing and extensive trade.
There were 4 large works, which employed from 20 to 30
labouring men, and paid an excise-duty from 8000 L. to
10,000 L. per annum In the year 1789, the soap trade in
Scotland met a considerable check.  It was for some time
almost annihilated here.  It has since, however, happily re-
vived, and is now carried on with a great deal of spirit.

   Commerce.-The commerce of this town has been for a
long time in a state of decline.  About the year 1640, the
shipmasters here were owners of above 20 vessels, most of
them large brigs, and generally employed in the carrying trade.
But as this trade has been found often to shift its situations,
this place at present has none of it.  About 9 years ago,
several vessels were built here, one of them a ship above 500
tons burden, and sitted out for the Greenland fishery.  A
trade was carried on by a very spirited inhabitant.  But as
lately he sold the whole of his shipping, at present there is
not a vessel belonging to this port.

   Fishery.-Attempts have been made to establish a fishery
here, at least such a fishery as might supply the town and
neighbourhood, but hitherto without success; although it is
the general opinion, that 2 or 3 industrious fishermen might
settle here to advantage.  The fish to be found in this part
of the Frith are cod, haddocks, whitings, skate, flounders,
herrings, crabs, lobsters, and oysters.  There are also some
very fine muscle scalps.  The herring fishery, which has
lately taken place in this neighbourhood, forms a most plea-
sant article in a statistical account.
   It began at the end or the year 1792, opposite to this, and
