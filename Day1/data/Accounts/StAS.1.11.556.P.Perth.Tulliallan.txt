   The church was formerly built about a mile farther
north than it is at present, and was very small, being only
36 feet in length, 16 in breadth, and 8 feet in height.
The present church is built half an English mile from the
shore, upon a rising ground, overlooking the village of Kin-
cardine, which lies between it and the Forth.  It was built
in 1675; and, were it not for its Gothic windows, would be
taken for a modern edifice.  It appears, from the parish re-
cords, that though the heritors built the church, they did not
seat it.  This the kirk-session, in order to accommodate the
people, did, out of the poor's funds; and afterwards, to reim-
burse those funds, sold them to the parishoners; which they,
their heirs, and assignees, possess to this day.  A seat, hold-
ing 5 persons, that was then sold for 4 s., now sells for 5 L.
