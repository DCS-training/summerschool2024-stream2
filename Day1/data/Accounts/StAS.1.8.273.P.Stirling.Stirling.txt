the commissary of Dumblane exercises his jurisdiction, as ly-
ing within the parish of Logic.

   Climate and Longevity.-The situation of Stirling is also
reckoned very healthy.  The height of the rock, on which
it stands, above the level of the flat carse grounds, no doubt
contributes much to this effect.  Epidemical diseases are
scarcely known.  At this very time there are four or five per-
sons in Stirling above 90.  The Croup, or Cynanche Trachea-
lis*, seems to be most fatal to children; the asthma and palsy
to old age.

   Burgh of Stirling.-Stirling is allowed to be a place of con-
siderable antiquity.  Buchanan mentions it again and again,
so early as the 9th century, but gives no description of it:
and to throw any light upon this subject, from the town's
charters, is impossible.  The most ancient of there records is
granted by King Alexander I. and is dated at Kincardine, the
18th of August, in the 12th year of his reign; whereas there
is reason to believe, that Stirling had been incorporated long
before, as the charter of Alexander is not a charter of erection,
but only confers some additional privileges on the burghers
and freemen.  Alexander the I. who granted this charter,
ascended the throne anno 1107, and reigned 17 years.  It
therefore bears date in 1120.  About the middle of the 12th
century, it would appear to have become a place of royal re-
sidence.  David I. kept his court at it, probably that he
might he near to the Abbacy of Cambuskenneth, which he
founded anno 1147, and on which he lavished many marks
of his favour. He brought the canons of that monastery from

with hoarseness, and a pecular whizzing found in inspiration, and a shrill ringing
sound in speaking and coughing, as if the noise came from a brasen tube.  It sel-
