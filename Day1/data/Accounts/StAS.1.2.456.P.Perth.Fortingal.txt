   Schools-The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge
have erected 4 charity schools in the parish.  The salary of
their schoolmasters is L. 10.  The people, who are distant
from these, and the parish school, pay for a boy to teach their
children to read and write.  We have 6 of these private
schools.

   Curiosities, and Miscellaneous Observations.-Among our cu-
riosities, may be reckoned a yew tree, in the church yard
of Fortingal, 52 feet round.  An old act of parliament, or-
dered all the burial grounds in the kingdom, to be planted with
yews for bows.  This is probably the only remaining one, and
an extraordinary tree it is.

   The Roman camp, already mentioned, is certainly the far-
thest inland one, of any that has been hitherto observed.  The
ditch and rampart are filled up, or broken down, in many pla-
ces, by the plough.  The Practorium is quite complete: The
area within is about 80 acres.  The late Lord Breadalbine em-
ployed some labourers to dig for antiquities: all they got was
three urns.  Roman coins have been got in different places,
in the country adjacent.
   There are a great many sorts throughout every district in
the parish.  They are circular, from 30 to 50 feet diameter,
built with immense stones.  One would wonder, how they
could be moved, without machines.  Their height is inconsi-
derable, not above 5 feet; but a good many of the stones have
fallen.  They are in view of one another, which would make
one think they might be alarm towers.  They extend from
Dunkeld to Glenorchy, and perhaps farther.  There are two
much larger, that had outworks*
