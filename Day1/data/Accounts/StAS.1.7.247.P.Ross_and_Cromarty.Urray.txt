surrounded by this dry barren soil, which seem to have been
once small lakes, but are now filled with peat moss.  On the
bottom of several of them some strata of shell marl have
been found.  There phenomena seem to prove the existence
of a general deluge, by which these stones have been round-
ed, and the shells deposited.  There are no lakes or swampy
ground in the parish, except one large meadow on the banks
of the Connon.-The air is dry, and free from noxious va-
pours, which conduces greatly to the healthfulness of the
climate.  No part of the common road, between the Frith of
Beauly and the river Connon, (which is almost the whole
length of the parish, seems to be above 50 feet higher than
the surface of the sea.  It is defended on the east from the
storms of the German Ocean by a tract of country, upwards
of 20 miles in extent, towards Tain and Cromarty, on the
north by the hill of Weavas, and on the west by the great
chain of mountains stretching to the west coast.  It is worth
remarking, that the western mountains make the weather al-
ternately foul and fair on the east and west borders of them,
in some measure similar to the monsoons on the Malabar and
Coromandel coasts.  The west and south-west winds blow
most frequently, during which it generally rains on the west
coast, and is fair weather on this side of the hills; or, at
most, there are only flight occasional showers.  On the other
hand, the east wind uniformly brings rain or sleet on the east
coast; but the storm dies away in the intermediate hills, and
there is dry weather and sunshine on the west coast.
