yond description.  The most considerable rivers are those
of Higichan and Glenbhargil, which scarcely deserve to be
mentioned, but for the salmon caught in them in autumn
and the latter end of summer.  The former, formed by
many streams rising in the hills of Cuillin and Strath, run
through a glen that divides Minguish in Bracadale from
the south end of Portree, and discharges itself into an inlet
of the sea, called Loch-Sligichan, two miles west of Sconser.
Having no bridge, in times of heavy rains the stream is so
violent and impetuous, that travellers dare not approach it.
The latter derives its source from several small lochs in
the moor N. W. of Higiedan, and after having run 2 miles
through it, continues its course further for a mile and a
half along the valley at the foot of Ait Suidbe Tbuin into
Portree Locb.

   Antiquities and Curiosities.-There are two Dunes, or
Danish forts, of round form, that bear marks of a very
high antiquity; one old castle, formerly the seat of the
Lairds of Raasay; and two Roman Catholic chapels.  One
of the dunes is situated on the coast; the other, inland.  Of
this last, scarcely 6 feet above the foundation remain, and
within it is full of rubbish; the other is in a more entire
state, and, like most of the same kind in the Highlands and
islands, seem to have been built by the Danish or Norwe-
gian invaders, rather as watch towers and strong holds, to
receive and secure their plunder, than as places of constant
or comfortable habitation.  Castle Broichin, situated near
the north end of Raasay, on the east coast, is a land-mark
well known to mariners.  The rock on which it stands,
nearly round, and covering an area of little more than 70
feet square, is about 40 feet high, except in one place,
where was the stair that led to it; and is itself, castle-like,
placed on another rock, 60 feet at least above the level of
