There is also in it a public clock, which is kept in order
and regulated at the expence of the Duke of Atholl.  A
singular rent appears on the west side of the steeple.  It be-
gins at the bottom of the uppermost window, and runs
down the middle of the wall.  No account can be obtained
of the time at which it happened, nor of the cause of it.
Most probably it was occasioned by a partial sinking of the
foundation.  It is from one inch to an inch and a half in
width*.
   Betwixt the south wall of the cathedral and the street
there is a narrow piece of inclosed ground, which is occu-
pied as a church-yard.  Formerly there was a row of trees
in it.  It contains no remarkable epitaph.  One, however,
should be mentioned, which has been frequently repeated as
copied from a tomb-stone there.  But, though it was compo-

*Bishop Brown placed five bells in the steeple.  On one of them there
was this inscription

     "Dulce molos tango
     "Sanctorum gaudra pango
     "Vux mea, vox grata,
     "Quia tempora signo grata"

   In consequence of this bell having been broken, and cast anew, the above
inscription is replaced by the following: "Me, cura et impensis Reverendi
"in Chiisto Patiis Georgii Broun Dunkeldensis Episcopi, primo susam,
"nunc, fuis sumptibus reficere et augeri caravit Joannis Atholiae Marchio
"Tullibardum Comes, Sigilli Privati, S.N.D.R. custos. anno Dom.
"1688."  On another of the bells are the words, "Joannis Meikle, nos
"fecit Edinburgi, anno 1688."
