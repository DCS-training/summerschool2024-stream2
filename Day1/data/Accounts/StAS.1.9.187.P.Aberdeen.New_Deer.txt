present incumbent was settled in the year 1737, there was
not a cart, but his own, in the parish: nor were there
roads which could be travelled in many places.  Then,
and for many years after, there was but one carrier, who
went weekly to Aberdeen with a horse and packets.
Sometimes he even went with nothing but a back creel,
and brought what merchandise and provisions were at the
time necessary.  Now, there is sufficient employment for
3 or 4 carriers, who go each with a cart and two horses.
Burning, where the soil was susceptible of it, was the prin-
cipal manure for raising corn: and many places wear the
impression to this day.  A kind of black bearded small
oats was then principally cultivated: now there is hardly
such a kind of grain in the parish.  Liming was much used
a few years ago; and, when necessary, can here be carried
on at a moderate expense.  But, although there is plenty
of limestone and fuel in the parish, and a kiln for burning
it on almost every farm and croft; yet the tenants are
now obliged, in a great measure, to discontinue the prac-
tice.  For it is found that lime, when applied in great
quantity, or soon repeated, reduces their soil to a mere
caput mortuum, producing little but thistles and other no-
xious weeds.  Where barren ground is to be fertilized, or
old ridges levelled and improved, the farmer still has re-
course to it; and, when judiciously laid on, it is found to
answer his most sanguine expectations.  When made into
a compost with earth and dung, it also makes an excellent
kind of manure for ley and turnip land.  This is general-
ly prepared in summer on a piece of the field, for which
it is designed, or as near it as possible.  Most of the farms
are inclosed, either with turf or stone fences.  The farm
houses are tolerably neat, and consist of one story.  For
the most part, they are built of stone and mortar, and
snecked with lime.  Stob-thatching is now become pretty
