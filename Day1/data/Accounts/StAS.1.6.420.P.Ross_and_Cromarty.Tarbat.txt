     Statistical Account

   Measurement, Manure, Natural Productions, etc.-There
is no general map of the parish, but, according to separate
plans made of the different estates, it contains 5081 acres; of
which, 2998 are arable, 66 out-field, 643 pasture, 1135 muir,
82 moss, and 166 planted.-The muir ground, which bears
so great a proportion to the arable, notwithstanding the appear-
ance of poverty in its present neglected state, might, by in-
closing, mixing the different soils by trenching, and laying on
lime, be turned into good arable ground, and brought to yield
profitable crops; of this, there is sufficient proof from what
is done by the cottars in those spots on which they sit down;
and an experiment on a larger scale has been made lately, and
with success, by Mr. Macleod of Geanies, on a piece of this
kind of ground of about 40 acres, which arc now improved
into fields of corn and grass.  The muir grounds, where
not fit to be improved for those purposes, might be rendered
useful, by inclosing and planting them with fir and other tim-
ber so much wanted in this place, which there is every reason
to think would grow here as in other parts near the sea.  The
thriving plantations begun some years ago by Mr. Macleod of
Geanies on his waste ground, and to which he is making year-
ly additions, may, it is to be hoped, call the attention of
the other gentlemen of property in the parish to this object.
   The arable ground yields barley, pease, oats and rye.  Half
is generally laid down with barley, or bear, and the ground is
prepared by covering it alternately with sea weed and dung,
with a mixture of black earth and gravel, this last being found
useful to give firmness to the soil rendered open by the fre-
quent use of sea weed.
   In different parts near the sea, are banks of shells, which
to the naked eye, have the appearance of coarse dark coloured
sand.  Mr. Wright, in his progress through the country, view-
ed those banks, and recommended the use of the shells as a
