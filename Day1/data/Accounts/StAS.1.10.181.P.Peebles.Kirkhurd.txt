it may.  This the general description of the treatment of
the land in tillage; but there are several exceptions, where
a better system is introduced; and the Norfolk system of a
rotation of four, seems to be approved of, where there is op-
portunity to carry it into practice.  In a few instances, the
dairy farming has been introduced as the chief article of
profit.
   The Scotch plough is generally used, with two strong
horses, except in 4 instances with four.  Small plough has
likewise been introduced.  The horses, young and old, in
this parish, will amount to about 70.  A few are reared for the
market, and sold when young; but the generality is for pri-
vate use, and to supply the waste of the old.  Thirty head of
black cattle, at an average of 4 L. each, may be told yearly.
The milch cows are, at an average, from 16 to 28 stones
weight.  They produce from 4 to 10 Scotch pints of milk
per day, a few 16 or 18.  The sheep are of the common
Scotch breed.  The number that can be spared is sold at
different periods.  In April, when big with young, at 10 L.
or 11 L. per score; in September, to the butcher, or for fur-
ther feeding, about 7 L. per score.  The lambs are sold in
July from 2 L. 10 s. to 4 L. per score.  What remains after
these different drawings, (as they are termed), are kept for
stock; they are all laid with butter or oil, and tar, about
Martinmas.  The wool of late years has been rapidly rising
in value.  It was sold last year, after being washed, at 6 s.
4 d. and 6 s. 6 d. per stone; 7 or 8 sleeces of the washed
wool generally go to the stone.
   Between 500 and 600 acres of land are inclosed, a consi-
derable part of which is well sheltered with trees, and suffi-
ciently watered.  This land, on an average, may be worth
16 s. per acre.  About 150 of these acres, divided into parks
of different sizes, command, by grazing, 160 L. per annum.
