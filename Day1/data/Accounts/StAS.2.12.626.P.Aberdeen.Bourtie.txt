   Land-owners.-The landholders are, Mr Ramsay of Barra (a
minor); Mr Leith Lumsden of Leithfield ; Mr Duguid of Bourtie
and Collyhill; Mr Mackenzie (of Glack) Thornton ; and Mr
Ross of Arnage (part of Bourtie.)  None of these are resident.

   The valued rent is L.2501 Scots. The real rent is about one-
fifth part greater, or L.3000 Sterling.
   Agriculture.-The parish contains about 5000 imperial acres.
Of these nearly 3600 are in cultivation, giving an average rent of
16s. per acre; in plantations, chiefly Scotch fir and larch, 360;
1000 uncultivated and waste, and a few acres of moss.  The most
general rotation of cropping pursued here (as indeed through Aber-
deenshire), is what is called the seven-shift; i. e. after grass, two
successive grain crops ; third year, turnips or potatoes ; fourth
year, grain crop sown down with grass seeds; fifth, sixth, and se-
venth years, grass crops.  From trials made by some distinguish-
ed agriculturists, the reporter is inclined to state his belief with
some confidence, that, through the greater part of this county,
which holds chiefly by a light loam, a six-shift, i. e, one grain crop
after grass, instead of two, would be more beneficial to the soil,
and, as a consequence, more beneficial eventually to the cultiva-
tor.  Leases are generally for nineteen years; it might be desira-
ble that their endurance should embrace at least three comp letelete
rotations.  Within the last ten years, between 300 and 400 acres
of waste land have been improved.  To this good work, Mr Du-
guid of Bourtie has greatly contributed, both his example, and
by judicious aid granted, to his tenants.  Of the 1000 acres re-
maining waste, nearly two-thirds might with advantage be brought

<FOOTNOTE>than any hardship. Might not the church recommend the general adoption of some
such plan, and thus save the country the heavy expense of the registration apparatus
with which it is threatened.
