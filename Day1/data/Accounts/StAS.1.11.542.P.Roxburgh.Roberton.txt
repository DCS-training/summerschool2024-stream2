and forming some others.  The road money, for the Rox-
burgh-shire part of this parish, is levied by an assessment of
from 7 s. to 10 s. on the 100 L. Scotch of valued rent: For that
in Selkirk-shire, by the statute labour.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Roberton is a modern parish.  Hassen-
dean, the old one, about 9 miles lower down the country,
was annexed to Minto and Wilton.  This was erected from
parts of the parishes of Hawick, Selkirk, Wilton, and Hassen-
dean.  The suppression of Hassendean, and erection of Rober-
ton, took place about the year 1682.  The decreet is supposed
to be lost.  The kirk bears the inscription 1695*.  In 1789,
it received a complete repair.  About the same time the
manse was also repaired; and in 1791, new offices were built.
The King is patron.  The stipend, (including communion
elements), consists of 77 L. morley, 14 bolls meal, and 12
bolls barley, Teviotdale measure.  The grain, and part of the
money, is paid from lands, in what was the old parish ot Has-
sendean; and, before an augmentation was obtained in 1788,
by the present incumbent, there was no more than 9 L. paid
to him, and 3 L. to the minister of Wilton, from lands within
the present cure, upon the supposition, that the remaining
part of the old stipend, paid in money, by the Duke of Buc-
cleugh, was for his lands in Hastendean; and this is the pro-
bable supposition.

*There are to be traced the remains of 2 chapels; in one of which, on the other
side of the Northwick, and opposite to the present lark, curates from Hassendean
were want to obstinate.  The church-yard of the other, (which is said to have
belonged to the diocese of Galloway), at Borthwick Brae, about 2 miles far-
ther up the same water, is still usd as the principal burying ground in this
neighbourhood.  GRIEVE and POTT are the names most frequent on the tomb
