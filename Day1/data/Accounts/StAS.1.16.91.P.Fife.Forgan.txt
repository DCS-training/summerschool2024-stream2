   Cultivation.-The improvement of the ground has, of
late years, made considerable progress, chiefly from the use
of lime, which, on our light and dry soil, has the most hap-
py effects.  The lime is driven in carts from the distance of
8 or 10 computed miles; some of the tenants bring it from
Northumberland by sea.  Their crops are by it enriched
when the season is not too dry.  Some lands that are marshy
have of late been greatly meliorated by draining.  ROBERT
STEWART, Esq; of St Fort, who is very active and indu-
strious, besides other improvements which he has made,
has drained a piece of ground, which, during the winter,
was almost covered with water.  It was fit for nothing but
feeding a few young cattle in summer; and, though con-
sisting of 52 acres, was sometimes let for about L. 5 or
L. 6.  It is more than probable, that in a few years it will
set for upwards of L. 50 Sterling.  What a blessing is it to
the country, when proprietors of land, instead of debauch-
ing their neighbours by examples of intemperance, set them
patterns of activity and honest industry!  How is the bless-
ing enhanced, when, by their example, the people under
them are led to fear God, and to reverence his sanctuary!
The neglect of this seldom fails to ruin the morals of the
people, and to destroy their industry.

   Produce-The farmers raise a pretty large quantity of
wheat, although it is reckoned to scourge the ground; but
they are tempted to prefer this crop by the high prices,
which are generally from L. 1 to L. 1, 5 s. per boll.  It is
measured with the small sulot, which is a great deal less
than that used for oats and barley.  They commonly have
good crops of barley, and generally get a good price, from
15 s. to 18 s. Sterling per boll.  They have also tolerable
crops of oats and pease.  The oats sell at from 12 s. to 14 s.
