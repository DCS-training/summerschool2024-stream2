of the transition mountains, secondary or floetz trap rocks occur.
It is supposed coal may be found in the parish, but hitherto no trial
has been made.
	Zoology.--Salmon in the spawning season are found in the rivers.
The sea trout, the hearling, and particularly the burn trout, are
caught in great numbers. Black-cock, grouse, partridge, pheasant,
hare, and rabbits are most abundant. The woodcock, curlew, plover,
lapwing, and snipe are also plentiful. The fox, the polecat, weasel,
and hedgehog are common.

			II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
	Parochial Registers.--Session records were begun to be kept
in this parish so early as 1646. In the same year, the registration
of baptisms and marriages commenced; and that of deaths in 1717.
From 1646 to 1680 the records of baptisms and marriages have
been correctly kept. In 1694, they were resumed by the prelates,
and since that time to the present they have been kept with much
accuracy, and preserved with great care. They are voluminous,
and contain much 'curious and interesting information regarding
the early discipline of the church.
	Land-owners.--The chief land-owners are, His Grace the Duke
of Buccleuch, Mr Elliot of Arkleton, Mr Beattie of Muckledale,
and Mr Lamb of Cooms and Middlemass.
	There are no resident heritors in the parish, neither are there
any modern buildings, mansion-houses, or manufactories.
	Antiquities.--The only antiquity to be found in the parish is
the remains of a small station, which evidently appears from its
formation to be either Saxon or Pictish. No medals, coins, arms,
or other antiquities have been discovered.
