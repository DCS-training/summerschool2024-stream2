Tay, by the rugged road which crosses the steep hills sepa-
rating Balmerino from Kilmany*.  From the vicinity of
the parish to the towns of Cupar and Dundee, it feels the
price of such provisions as the country produces in abun-
dance, affected by the constant demand of these large mar-
kets.  Hence cheese, butter, fowls, eggs, are brought at a
higher price at Kilmany, because, from the progress of
luxury, they are fought with greater avidity than beef or
mutton, and from the wealth of the inhabitants, are pur-
chased at an enormous rate at Dundee.  Out of the mar-
kets of the towns just mentioned, those who do not kill their
own meat are supplied.  It was once easy to bring, at all
hours, such supplies to Kilmany; for the high road betwixt
Cupar and Dundee run through the village.  Some years
ago, (for it is but of late that Fife can boast of having a
turnpike-road), the course of this road was turned eastwards,
three miles from Kilmany.  The public profited by the
change, for they travel by a smooth instead of a hilly road;
but the village suffered; for it no longer enjoys the wonted
frequent opportunities of conveyance betwixt Cupar and
Dundee.

   Population.-The parish is the residence of husbandmen.
Agriculture is the universal employment; it is the source
and the substance of its few commercial transactions.  It
gives subsistence to almost every individual in the parish;
to the farmers, to their servants, to the families of these
servants, who are the great body of inhabitants; and to the
few mechanics, whose offices are necessary for carrying on

*It must surely be desired by all who have grain to export, that the
road to Balmerino were better made.
