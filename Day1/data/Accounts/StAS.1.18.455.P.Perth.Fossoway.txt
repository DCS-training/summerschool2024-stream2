spin, and fees more distinctly, than when at the age of 70.
The number of married persons is 456, and the number of
children from each marriage, between 5 and 6.  The num-
ber of families is 340, and the number of persons in each fa-
mily, between 4 and 5.  The number of inhabitants has
been decreasing for several years.  In the year 1755, by the
return made to Dr Webster, the number was 1765.  In the
year 1771, it was 1828; in the year 1780, 1716; in the
year 1785, 1610; and it has been stated as at present only
1505.  Many reasons can be given for this diminution of
numbers.  A few years ago, several weavers, masons, and
house-carpenters, with their families, went into towns, where
they found more ready employment, and higher wages.  Se-
veral gentlemen having inclosed their lands, they have let
them in grass, and have no fixed tenants; others, having
taken the possession of them into their own hands, and going
on with their improvements, have dismissed several of their
cottagers; the new mode of ploughing without a driver,
which now very much prevails, has lessened the number of
farm-servants; and the union of different farms has also had
its influence.  When agriculture is carried on by employing
cottagers, they not only remain longer than other servants
on the same farms, but by having families, and a settled re-
sidence, they add greatly to the number of the inhabitants.
Hired servants frequently change their situations every half-
year, and having nothing to attach them to one spot, seldom
continue long with any one master.  To give encouragement
to cottagers, and villages, on proper regulations, would be
of service both to proprietors, and to the community at large.
