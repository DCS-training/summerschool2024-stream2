Craig, before the Revolution in 1668.  Since that time the
people have been happy under the successful ministry of
Messrs George Park, James Bain, James Morrison, and the
present incumbent, James Graham, who was ordained
anno 1768.  The church was rebuilt in the year 1734, and
is conveniently seated.  Mr John Finlayson has, for nearly
40 years, officiated as parochial schoolmaster.  The salary
is L. 8, 13 s. yearly.  The wages for English, writing, and
arithmetic are only 1 s. 6 d. per quarter.  Three or four
private schools have, for some time past, been kept in dif-
ferent parts of the parish; the numerous rivulets and deep
glens by which the country is intersected, render, to child-
ren living at a distance, the access to the parochial school
always dangerous, and often impossible.

   State of the Poor.-Paupers usually on the session-list are
from 10 to 15, who, according to their need, receive from
4 s. to 16 s. per quarter.  A few indigent families receive,
after the sacrament, a little supply, as the minister and
elders see proper.  The funds for answering there chari-
table purposes amount annually to about L. 30, the most of
which is collected in boxes handed by the elders through
the church, immediately before pronouncing the blessing in
the forenoon.  None of the poor are permitted to beg.  To
be so poor as to need assistance from the kirk-session is in
this, and most other places of Scotland, where poor taxes
are not established, accounted a disgrace, as such a state is
commonly considered as proceeding, for the most part,
either from indolence or mismanagement.  Every attempt
to eradicate, or even to weaken such a sense of shame, is
doing a manifest injury to society.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Superstition yet continues
to operate so strongly on some people, that they put a small
