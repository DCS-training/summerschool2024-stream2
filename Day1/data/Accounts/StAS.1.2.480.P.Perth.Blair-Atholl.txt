     Statistical Account

   Dress-The ladies and gentlemen generally dress as in the
low country; though, when at home, some of the gentle-
men wear the country dress; which is, a bonnet, a short
coat, a little kilt, or philebeg, tartan hose, and a plaid; but
the trouse and belted plaid never recovered their place since
1745.  Some, of both sexes, wear the Lowland dress.  Ma-

&c.

   Schools.-There is a parish school at Blair; the master of
which, has a salary of L. 10 paid by the heritors, and 100
merks Scots paid out of the bishop-rents.  For the rest, he

master of one of which, the Society for Propagating Christi-

L. 4, per annum.  These united parishes have no benefit from
the labours of any itinerant clergyman, or catechist; but many,
from other parishes hear divine service in the churches here.

the country, with respect to their cattle of all kinds; but
much of it is now getting into the hands of a few individuals.
The air of the country is very healthful.-Two veins of
lime-stone run through the country from N. E. to S. W. and
a third has appeared in one place.-The Duke and Mr Ro-

in general is good, and when the seasons are favourable, is
prolisic.  On the other hand, we have a great deal of cold
and frosly weather, which must be unfavourable to the growth
of vegetables, and even of animals.  On the level ground,
near the Garry, fogs and hoar frosts are very pernicious to po-
