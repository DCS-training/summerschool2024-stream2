Many persons who have been accustomed for a short time
to eat the bread of this town, have sent for it from the di-

her recollection, I am informed, in 1720 there were only
three ships which failed from this place.  By the same
person, though this may not be the proper place to men-
tion it, I am informed, that before the year 1745, all the
