     The population of the parish was formerly much greater than
it is at present.
     Different causes appear to have operated in producing this de-
crease. About fifty or sixty years ago, the farms in this country
were generally of small extent, and much more numerous than at
present. Ample employment and maintenance were thus afforded
to many families, and the population of the country parishes con-
sequently great. But the farms are now generally of large ex-
tent and few in number, and though laboured much more skilfully
and perfectly than formerly, the number of cultivators is much di-
minished. It was also the prcatice of the farmers in these times
to lease out to each of their cottars, and to those who had houses
on the farm, two or three acres of land at a moderate rent, and to
give it the requisite cultivation. They also allowed them to keep
cows, and provided them with grass in the summer and straw in
the winter, for their maintenance. These privileges were highly
valued by the people, and contributed much to their comport and
advantage. From the produce of their land and dairy, they had
abundance of plain food for the maintenance of themselves and
families; and in seasons of sickness, when unable for their daily
labour, they could subsist for a time on their own means without
being forced to apply for public aid. But this practice has been
discontinued, and none even of the farm-servants enjoy the advan-
tage of a cow except the Foreman. In consequence of this change,
the people of the country who were tradesmen, seeing that they
enjoyded none of the comforts of the country, left the habitations of
their fathers, and established themselves in the towns from which
their employment was principally derived. This desertion has
prdoduced in many parishes a paucity of labourers for field work,
particularly for the green crop husbandry, which has been rapidly
increasing for some time past, and is now carried on to a great,
extent.
