     of the Abbey Parish of Paisley.

   Woods.-There are no woods of any great extent in the
parish; perhaps about 140 acres of natural oak, ash, birch-
plane, etc. may be the amount of the whole, upon three or
four different estates.  The Forest of Paisley exists only in
ancient records. Walter, Great Steward of Scotland, by the
charter of foundation of the monastery of Paisley, grants to
the monks "Decimas de omnibus terris infra Forestum suum
de Pasleto."  In Prynne's Collections, we meet with " John
le Hunter de la foreste de Pasly."  And, in 1460 and 1524,
the tenant of Dunskaith-wood, in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the town, is bound by the abbot "Custodire sylvam
et sustentare fossas circa dictam sylvam."  The names of
Woodside, Oakshawside, and Oakshawhead, are the only
traces that remain of those woods.

   Roads.-The only turnpike-road in the parish is that run-
ning through it from east to west.  Of late years, it has been
kept in very good repair.  The others, which depend upon
the statute labour, are in a very indifferent state.  This, it is
hoped, will be remedied by a bill to be brought into Parlia-
ment next session for making some new turnpike-roads, con-
verting the statute work into money, and regulating the ap-
plication of it.

   Mines and Minerals.-There are five coal-mines at present
wrought in the parish.  That at Hurlet, belonging to the
Earl of Glasgow; Quarreltown, to Mr Houstoun of Johns-
toun; Achinloadmont, to Mr Fulton of Achinloadmont;
Nutshiel, to Mr Dunlop of Househill; and one lately open-
ed in the lands of Newton, the property of Mr Spiers of El-
derslie.  Of these, the two first merit particular notice.-
The Hurlet or Hawkhead coal lies about three miles south-
east from Paisley.  It is a stratum 5 feet 3 inches thick, de-
