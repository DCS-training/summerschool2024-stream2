of the Secession Meeting-houses, are new and handsome speci-
mens of architecture.
	The Academy is a fine roomy structure, in a dry and healthy si-
tuation. There are also a poor's-house, and an Infirmary; which
latter building stands on an air locality, at the sount east extremity
of the town, the right wing being used as a lunatic asylum. This
institution has proven a great blessing to the whole south of Scot-
land.
	There are branches of the following banks in Dumfries,--viz.
the british Linen Company, the Banks of Scotland, the National,
and the Commercial Banks. For the latter of these, a costly and
classical structure has lately bedn erected. A house which was
orhginally intended for a Bridewell, has long been employed as a
depot for the arms and accoutrements of the county militia. There
are three water-mills belonging to the town, but these stand on the
opposite side of the river, in the parish of Troqueer. A little
above the old bridge, already noticed, stands the new bridge, erect-
ed in 1794, and which, though more substantial than elegant, is
not destitute of beauty.
