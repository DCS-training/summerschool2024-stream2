it has been our uniform purpose to show is, that the scientific, li-
terary, and other secular information, now communicated in our
schools, should have infused into it the vivifying spirit of a genuine
Christianity, and that it ought ever to be the primary object of
education, to which all merely secular views should hold a subor-
dinate place, to build up the moral and religious man.  To a due
regard to this primary object, however, it is by no means requisite
that the secular branches of education should be less efficiently
taught than they now are, or that the course of instruction in our
schools should be rendered in consequence less adapted to the bu-
siness of secular avocations; but only that all secular knowledge
should be grafted upon the stock of religious truth, and caused
thus to manifest in its farther development the pervading influ-
ence of that better knowledge, which, whatever our secular pur-
suits may be, is essential to the dignity of our calling as men.  It
is allowed, that, for the perfecting in detail of a system of educa-

for the composition of school books, constructed in just conformi-

the interest of the youthful mind, and embracing, at the same time,
the wide range of subjects, some knowledge of which is at the pre-
sent day held to be essential, even to a good school education, a
combination of genius, talent, and acquirement is requisite, such
as is to be expected only in the most gifted and cultivated of our
race.  The amount of merely secular knowledge required it might
not indeed be very difficult to obtain ; but that intimate acquaint-
ance with the constitution of the human mind, that profound
practical insight into the genius and spirit of our most holy faith, and
that fine perception of the analogies subsisting between natural
and revealed truth, which are essentially necessary to the working
up, into attractive forms, instinct with spiritual religion, of the
raw materials which secular knowledge provides, obviously im-
ply the possession of a very high order both of capacity and culti-
vation.
   Unquestionably, with reference to our second topic of inquiry,
the Established Church is the party which is bound, by con-
siderations of the highest possible moment, to use its best energies
in devising, perfecting, and applying an effectual remedy.  The
duties of the presbyteries of the Church, in visiting and examin-
ing the schools within their respective bounds, have generally been
performed, it may be admitted, with sufficient fidelity; and it is
