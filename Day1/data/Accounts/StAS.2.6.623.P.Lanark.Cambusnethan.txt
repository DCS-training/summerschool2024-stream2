given by Sir Henry Steuart to build a school, a teacher's house,
and garden, to which there is attached a small salary.
	There are at present altogether nine schools which the children
of the parish attend, and this last season (1838), there were at
one time 476 scholars at the whole, which is no less than one to
every eight inhabitants.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons
regularly receiving parochial aid is 50. Those who receive acci-
dental charity vary according to circumstances. From L. 200 to
L. 250 is annually distributed. The collections at the church-
doors, amounting to about L. 45, and the sums received for mort-
cloths, together with an annual collection from each of the Dis-
senting houses, are the chief sources of their relief; and what is
required beyond these, is made up by the heritors, according to
their respective valuations. The whole valuation of the parish is
L. 5400, 10s. Scots. During the years 1832 and 1833, there was
a regular assessment on the parish, and then the collections at the
church dwindled into a mere trifle. The poor came forward
shamelessly demanding support; and this plan was attended with
so many difficulties, it was so unpopular and likely to bring such
an additional burden on the parish, that it was laid aside.
	The inhabitants have given a good specimen of their taste for
literature by the institution of two libraries, supported by subscrip-
tion, and containing a judicious selection of books chiefly histori-
cal and religious.
	About the centre of the parish, still called Chapel, there is said
to have been an ancient place of worship. But no vestige of it now
remains. And in the eastern part of it, at Darmead Linn, there
are said to be the ruins of an old church "where Cameron thun-
dered, and where Renwick poured the gentle notes."
