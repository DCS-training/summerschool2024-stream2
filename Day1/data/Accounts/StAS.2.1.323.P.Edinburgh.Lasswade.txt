             PARISH OF LASSWADE.

 PRESBYTERY OF DALKEITH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE

         I--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   As this parish is now divided into two parishes, quoad sacra, it
is proposed to treat of them separately. We begin with Lasswade
parish, quoad sacra, including in this account the temporal mat-
ters, which are still common to both parishes.
   Name.--Chalmers says the name is derived from the Kirktown
or village of Lasswade, which signifies a well-watered pasture of
common use. Laeswade in Anglo-Saxon signifies a common, and
weyde in old English a meadow. As the name of the parish has
been seen, in an old Dutch map, spelled Lesserwede, it may be
considered to mean the opposite of Legerwood,--the smaller
wood of Lasswade being contrasted with some larger wood not
far distant.
   Extent.--Lasswade parish, before it was lately divided, consist-
ed of three parishes and a provostry, viz. the parish of Lasswade
proper, the parish of Melville, the parish of Pentland, and the
provostry of Roslin. At this period, its extreme length was about
8 miles, and its extreme breadth about 5 miles. Its length now
is about 6 miles, and its breadth about 3 miles. It camprehends
about 8 square miles.
   In the twelfth century, the church and lands of Lasswade were
bestowed on the Bishop of St Andrews, and Lasswade thus be-
came one of the Mensal churches. But whether Lasswade pro-
per be meant, or Lasswade consisting of a number of parishes,
cannot now be ascertained. It is probable that Lasswade proper
is intended; for the junction and the consequent suppression of
parishes is a device of Protestant and not Popish times. There
can be no doubt that the parish of Melville, including the baronies

of the minister of the parish.
