If this reasoning be well founded, it is evident that small
farms may sometimes be united, and larger farms, in some
cases, divided to advantage.  But it may be said, does not
the junction of small farms tend, in every instance, to dimi-
nish the population of a country, and is not the publick a
sufferer by it?  We must admit, that where the industry of
the small farmer and his family cannot be turned into another
channel equally beneficial to themselves and the community,
this will be the case.  On the other hand, at a period when
the demand for manufacturers is great, and their wages high,
it may be advantageous both to the individuals and the publick,
that some of the small farmers become manufacturers.  The
case of this useful class of men, is indeed much to be pitied,
when they are turned out of their small possessions, where
there is no demand for their labour in many other line; they
must then either emigrate of slarve, and the country will, in
a short time, severely fell the loss.  It appears, then that the
state of trade and manufactures must have considerable influ-
ence in regulating the size of farms; so that what would be
sound policy in this respect, at one period, would be the re-
verse at another.  If it be said, that after all, the interest of
the proprietor will naturally induce him to prefer the highest
offer for his lands; and that as the extensive farmer can af-
ford to give more rent than small tenants, the former will ob-
tain the preference, and farms will continually increase in
size; in answer to this, it may be observed, that neither the
proprietor nor the the farmer, even in a sheep country, will find
it his advantage that the farm be more extensive than what
one person can properly manage.  The proper check, then,
when farms become overgrown, appears to be at hand; and
the wisdom of providence is equally conspicuous in this, as
in many other instances, which often escape our observa-
tion.
