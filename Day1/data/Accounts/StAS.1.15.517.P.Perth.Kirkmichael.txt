lar fences of stone, the outer circle being about 50 feet, and
the inner 32 feet in diameter.  There are also the vestiges
of six, perhaps more, single circular inclosures of stone, from
32 to 36 feet in diameter, lying at different distances in the
neighbourhood of the cairn.  Two parallel stone fences ex-
tend from the east side of the cairn, nearly in a straight line,
to the southward, upwards of 100 yards.  These fences are
bounded at both extremities by small cairns, and seem to
form an avenue or approach to the great cairn of 32 feet in
breadth.  There can be little doubt that all these are re-
liques of Druidism; that the great cairn is one of those at
which they celebrated their solemn festivals in the beginning
of summer and the beginning of winter,* when they offer-
ed sacrifices, administered justice, etc., and that the circles
and lesser cairns, must have been the scenes of some other
religious rites, of which the memory and knowledge are now
lost.  Similar cairns are to be seen in the neighbouring pa-
rishes, and in different parts of the Highlands; but this pa-
rish has to boast of a more uncommon and remarkable mo-
nument of Druidical superstition.
   About a mile N. E. from the above mentioned great
cairn, on a flat-topped eminence, surrounded at some distance
with rocky hills of considerable height, and steep ascent,
stands one of those rocking stones which the Druids are said
to have employed as a kind of ordeal for detecting guilt in

ing a consecrated cake, etc. on the 1st of May, is not quite worn out.
