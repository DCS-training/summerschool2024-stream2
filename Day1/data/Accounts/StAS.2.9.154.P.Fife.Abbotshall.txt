stair of 54 feet in length. From the top of this tower so extensive
is the view, that not less than parts of fourteen, some say sixteen, dif-
ferent counties can be distinctly pointed out in a clear day. In the
near vicinity of Raith, and a little further up the country, stands the
mansion-house of Wester Bogie, the property of Miss Thomson, only
child of the late James Thomson, Esq. of Wester Bogle. The house
of Bogie is modern, and was built after a design by Mr Gillespie Gra-
ham, in the form of a castle. The plan of building is well suited
to the situation, which is high, and surrounded with some fine old
trees. The extent of ground is limited; but, for its size, Bogie is
considered one of the most desirable properties in the county.
