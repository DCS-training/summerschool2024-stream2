accident brought a curious stone into view.  It had
dropped from the top of a quarry, worked immediately
under the described Chester-knows.  Captain Home's
attention to it, was occasioned by the mason's brush be-
ing stuck into it, and the singularity of its having a hole,
and its heavy weight, induced him to have it brought
home.  It is mostly of an orbicular form; and although
of a substance as hard as marble, it is persorated exactly
in the middle; it is convex on all sides but one, but one, which is
flat; while its other surface is not only rough, but fret-
ted, as if it had been artificially raised into small notches.
Its weight, yet untried, may be between 2 and 3 stone.
Upon considering these particulars, it was suggested, that
being evidently worked upon, and fitted to some purpose
of art and utility, it might be the upper part of a mole-
trina or hand-mill, for corn, such as was used by the Ro-
mans in their campaigns.  That it correspondend to this
conjecture, is evinced from the aptitude of the persora-
tion, to admit aniron axis or spindle, of near an inch
thick, which, terminating in the socket of an under stone,
excavated for holding corn, and wide enough to receive
into it this upper part; and being moveable by a handle
fixed to its top, could make the found stone act as grind-
er of the grain, with all its power of attraction.  Since
passing this judgment upon the stone, Captain Home has
been informed, by the tenant of the ground, where the
Chester-knows are, that, in the course of his agricul
ture, he had met there with a large hollowed round
stone, which, being sunk 3 or 4 feet deep into the earth,
was allowed to remain in its  place.  Whether this stone up-
on its being inspected, or dug up, may be the wanted tal-
ly to that in Mr. Home's possession, we know not; but if
the latter be itself judged, by the intelligent in such anti-
