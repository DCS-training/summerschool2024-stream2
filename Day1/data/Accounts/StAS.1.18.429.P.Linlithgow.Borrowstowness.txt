the place.  But these nuisances being now removed from the
immediate vicinity, to a considerable distance, and more at-
tention paid to cleaning the street., the air is more pure and
salubrious, and the town assumes a very different aspect.
Still, indeed, the smoke from the Grange coal works on the
east, the Bo-ness salt-pans on the west, and the dust excited
by the carts carrying coals to the quays for exportation, occa-
tionally incommode the inhabitants.
   An elegant building, said to be an exact model of Inveraray
house, was built at the head of the harbour, about 20 years
ago, by the Duke of Hamilton.  The ground floor was in-
tended for a Prison, the second for a Court-room, and the
attic story, for a School.  But, the original intention not
having been carried into execution, this fine building is going
to ruin.  Any rooms in repair, are employed as granaries.
If the original design were executed, the house would be
highly useful and ornamental to the place.
   Water is sometimes scarce in summer, the coal-mines hav-

in great abundance, and of an excellent quality, fit for every
domestic purpose.  It is proposed to bring it to the town by
pipes, for the benefit of the inhabitants.  Crowded as the
houses may appear to a stranger, no bad consequences are
felt.  No endemical diseases prevail.  The epidemics, such
as the small-pox, measles, chincough, etc. are not more

and fevers, when they do prevail, are in general of a low,
nervous class.  It has been observed, that health is enjoyed in
a greater degree about Borrowstownness, than in many other
towns of its size and population.  This is easily accounted for.
