he might have been brought to approve.  In this manner, he
is induced to justify a mode of cultivation, which, whether
right or wrong, he must carry into execution.  The effect of 
services, when rigorously exacted, in dispiriting the farmer,
and in rendering him indolent, and even indifferent to his
most important occupations, must be obvious to any person.
It ought to be remarked here, in justice to the proprietors,
that different tenants of this parish have been long resident on
their possessions, particularly in the estates of Mid-Marr and
Sheils.  A fact, somewhat singular, is, that the farm of
Bankhead, in the latter estate, has been occupied, during
three centuries, by a race of farmers of the name of Fowler:
These, with the Tytlers of Corsinday, (of whom different fa-
milies and well known names are descended,) have possessed
the same farms during many generations, and been esteemed at
all times for their integrity and the propriety of their conduct.

   Rent, Heritors, Farmers.-The valued rent of Mid-Marr
amounts to L 2387 Scots; the real rent, as nearly as can be
conjectured, is from L. 1000 to L. 1100 Sterling.  The far-
mers are in number 35; who pay, for their best arable land,
about 20 s; and, at an average, about 15 s per acre, for all their
infield ground.  They draw from their subtenants, for such
land, from 20 to 25 s per acre, themselves ploughing it.  There

heritor does not reside in it.  The public road is kept up by
statute labour, to which the males, from 15 to 60 years of
age, are called out, twice a year, at Mid-summer, and after
harvest.  An exemption from personal service may be obtain-
ed, by the payment of 1 s 6 d a year.  But there are few in-
stances, wherein the individual does not either work himself,
