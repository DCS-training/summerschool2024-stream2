     Statistical Account

   Inundation.-The town of Hawick, though not subject to
inundations, has every reason to be afraid of them.  It stands
at the conflux of the rivers Slitridge and Teviot, which, after
great rains, or the dissolving of the snows on the adjacent hills,
rise several feet upon the houses immediately situated on their
banks.  A remarkable one happened in August 1767.  Slit-
ridge then rose to an astonishing height, occasioned by a cloud
bursting at its source.  It began to rise at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, and continued to increase till past 6, when it was
22 feet above its usual level.  It marked its progress with de-
struction.  Part of the surface of the hill, where the cloud fell,
floated into the river.  Corn and cattle, with every thing on
its banks, were born away by the torrent.  In Hawick, its
devastations were great; 15 dwelling-houses, and a corn mill,
were carried off, and the rock swept so clean, that not a bit
of rubbish was left to tell where they stood.  At the height of
the flood, a maid servant, belonging to a merchant, recollect-
ing that in the house, now surrounded with water, her master
had 300 L. in gold, boldly ventured in, and got hold of the bag
with the money:  In returning, however, she was carried
down by the stream, but was cast ashore on a green below the
town, herself and the money both safe.  In this alarming
event two lives were lost; both indeed through rashness and
inattention.

   Eminent Men.-Hawick, as far as the present incumbent
can learn, has given birth to few men of considerable emin-
ence in literature, in the field, or in rank.  Some, however,
who have resided in it, have shone in their particular stations.
Amongst these, we must first rank GAVIN DOUGLAS*, Bishop
