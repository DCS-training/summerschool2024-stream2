rish was Colonel James Gardner, killed at the unfortunate
battle of Prestonpans in 1745, whose remarkable conversion,
with many interesting particulars of a life and character, no

   Antiquities.-That celebrated Roman work called Graham's
Dyke, terminates in this parish, it is said, at a place called
Waltown.  About 50 years ago, in digging up stones to build
a park dyke, axes, pots, and several vases, evidently Roman,
were found, and sent to the Advocates Library at Edinburgh,
where they still are.  In this parish stands the ancient fort, or
garrison, of Blackness, one of the oldest forts in Scotland, and
one of the four that is to be kept in repair by the articles of
Union.  It has a governor, lieutenant-governor, 2 gunners,
1 sergeant, 2 corporals, and 12 or 15 privates.  It is built in
the form of a ship.
