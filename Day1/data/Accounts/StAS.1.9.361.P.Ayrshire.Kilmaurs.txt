this short rest, it got a little dressing, with what dung could
be spared from garden and potatoes.  The outfield lay in
grass so many years, and was ploughed so many as was a-
greed upon, without any manure whatever, during which
time there were bad crops, and as bad pasture; therefore
poor tenants, and small ill paid rents.  When such leases
came to an end, and when the land was completely inclosed,
the distinction of outfield and infield was taken away, and
a method of farming, very simple, yet well adapted to the
nature of the soil, was introduced, particularly in the ma-
nagement of Lord Eglinton's estate.  The great object was
to lift the land for tillage, and to lay it down again in good
heart.  Rest and lime were sufficient for the first, and a re-
striction in ploughing, with the application of dung to the
last or two last crops in that restriction for the latter.  To
promote these ends effectually 3 divisions were made of
each farm, 1 of which was limed at the proprietor's ex-
pense with the quantity of 100 or 150 bolls the acre,
which is burnt by the farmers themselves, and spread upon
the field to be ploughed, sometimes 12 months, and some-
times only 2 before tilling.  This one division and no more
is allowed at a time to be in tillage.  The other 2 remain
under grass.  After ploughing the one division mentioned
for 3 years successively, it was committed to rest on the
last of these, with grass-seeds sown among those for the 3 d
crop.  Then another division, limed at the tenant's expense,
was broken up, and so in rotation.  The tenant is always
permitted to cut the grass for the 1st year of that division
which was last laid down.  This method is still in practice;
but where the farm is large, another mode has been adopt-
ed; 4 divisions are preferred to 3; and each division is
ploughed 3 years, then rests 9; or 2 grain crops are ta-
ken from it, and then is turned into pasture, in which state
