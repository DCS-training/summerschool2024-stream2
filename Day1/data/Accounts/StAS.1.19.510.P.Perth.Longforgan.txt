these, a coat of fix inches of straw, furze, or broom is laid,
to keep the earth which is now filled in over it, from trind-
ling through, and which in time forms a matted coat, and
leaves about a foot or 14 inches of surface above.  The
furze or broom is better than the straw, but good gravel,
free of earth, if it can be had, is better than either.  If that
should not be judged of sufficient depth for the plough, the
ditch may be made deeper at first.  These under-ground
drains are called here sivers, and, if carefully constructed at
first, may remain in good order, and answer every purpose
expected from them for many years, while the whole field
appears one uniform surface.  Mr Paterson drained a field,
to full of rocky protuberances that he was obliged to feel
his way with an iron rod, to know where there was space
enough between the rocks to guide the drain to be made.

   Instruments of Husbandry.-The instruments of husban-
dry commonly used in this parish, differ very little from
what is used in the neighbourhood.
   There are 122 ploughs, all of which, at least such as good
farmers use, are of Small's construction, with iron mould-
boards, or generally so.  Some smaller farmers indeed use one,
which partakes of the old Scots plough, and which they call
a mongrel; but it is a very inferior instrument.  About
twenty years ago, and even less, four horses, two and two
abreast, were frequently seen in the plough, with one man
holding and another driving; sometimes with three horses
and two; But now, ploughing is entirely performed
with two horses abreast, with one man who holds and
drives, except upon very particular occasions, when hard
ground must be raised by main force; and which requires
the exertion of four horses.
