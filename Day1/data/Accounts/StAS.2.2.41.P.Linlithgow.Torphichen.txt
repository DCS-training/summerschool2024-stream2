                    TORPHICHEN.                          41

In the year 1298, while the heroic Sir, William Wallace was
Regent of Scotland, he held his head-quarters at the preceptory
of Torphichen for some time previous to the battle of Falkirk, as
appears from a charter granted by him as regent, conferring some
lands at Dundee upon Alexander Scrimgeour, the royal standard-
bearer, as a reward for his services, which charter is dated at Tor-
phichen, the 29th day of March 1298. * It would seem that the
then preceptor bad previously sworn fealty to Edward I. of Eng-
land, as did so many Scottish nobles, but redeemed his character
for patriotism, and afterwards fell at the fatal battle of Falkirk,
fought on the 22d of July 1298. His name is given by Rymer
as Alexander de Wells.
   The next Preceptor of whom particular mention is made was
Sir William Knolles, who held the preceptorate about half a cen-
tury, and was commonly designated Lord St John. He held the
offices of Councillor and Treasurer in the reign of James IV.,
and was killed fighting by the side of that brave but rash monarch
at Flodden Field in 1513. He was succeeded by Sir George
Dundas, who had been the fellow-student of Rector Bootius at
Paris, and was distinguished for his learning. Sir Walter Lind-
say was the next preceptor, who also rose to distinction in the
kingdom, and was appointed to the office of Justice-General of
Scotland in the reign of James V. In Sir David Lindsay's
"Testament of Squyer Meldram," he is mentioned in the follow-
ing laudatory terms:
