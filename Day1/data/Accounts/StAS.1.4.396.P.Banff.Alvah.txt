now expended on a single cart, than would then have pur-
chased both cart and horse.  The size of farms is increa-
sing, and of consequence their number diminishes.  We
account one of from L. 30 to L. 50 rent, a middle sized
farm.  There are a few above that rent, but many more
below it.-This parish, unless in very bad years, produces
much more grain than is necessary for the subsistence of its
inhabitants.  Besides the farm-victual, which amounts to a
very considerable part of the rent, there are large quanti-
ties, both of meal and barley, annually sold by the farmers
for the supply of the neighbouring town of Banff, and for
exportation.  In 1782 the crop was so defective, that, ac-
cording to the computation of inspectors, there was not
grain within the parish sufficient to supply it beyond the
month of April.  By the attention and generosity of the
heritors, and the bounty of Government, with L. 40 from
the funds of the parish, the poorer sort were supplied.  The
most curious fact relating to that alarming period was, that
the oats on the earlier grounds, which ripened, were plump,
and were found on trial to yield abundance of excellent
meal, did not vegetate when sown next year; whereas the
oats on late grounds which were green, and neither filled
nor ripened, sprang up with vigour.  As this was not found
out till too late, it proved of the greatest detriment to the
succeding crop.  The seed, which had been bought up at
an enormous expence, misgave; what might have greatly
contributed to the support of families, was unprofitably
cast into the ground; and what might have been profitably
sown, was sent to the mill, where it made but a scanty
return.
