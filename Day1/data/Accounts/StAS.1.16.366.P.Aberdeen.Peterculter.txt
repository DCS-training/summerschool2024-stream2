possessions, and let to separate tenants, so that every house-
holder, with a few exceptions, pays to the proprietor.  Ma-
ny of them pay their rent by carrying milk and fuel to
Aberdeen; and the improvement of the land is not much
minded.  If they can lay out a small spot in turnip and
grass for a milk-cow or two, they seek no more.  One of
the tenants, indeed, has a pretty large farm, well inclosed
and subdivided, and raises green crops, etc. and pays, I be-
lieve, between L. 70 and L. 80 of rent.  He keeps a slock of
sheep, consisting of 100 or more, the only sheep on that estate.
Formerly there were from 10,000 to 12,000 on it; but the
tenants say, that they cannot now keep any, since so much
hill has been inclosed and planted.  It is to no purpose to
expatiate on the advantage of keeping sheep; to recom-
mend to them to employ a herd to tend several small flocks
joined in one, and each person to pay according to his
number of sheep.  They will not alter their plan.  Most
of the tenants keep the old track, they sow Scots barley
and oats alternately; few sow pease.  It is common to ma-
nure 2 or 3 acres annually, by making a fold, and keeping
their cattle inclosed there all summer and harvest, except
the time they are on pasture in the morning and afternoon.
The common Scotch plough is mostly used, and is some-
times drawn by 10 or 12 small oxen under yoke, some-
times by 4 horses, and sometimes both by oxen and horses
6 or 8 in number; nay, we are still so Gothic in some pla-
ces, that a horse and an ox are matched together.  Some
instances could be produced of ploughs, of English con-
struction, drawn by 2 horses, or by 2 large oxen in traces,
without a driver.  It is to be regretted, that the instances
are so few.
