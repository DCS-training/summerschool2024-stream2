is partly flat, but, for the most part, declining towards the
north.  The soil in the southern part is light and sandy,
but by proper culture, bears rich crops; in the higher
ground of the very beautiful and fertile bank that faces the
sea, it is deep black loam; in some places, very rich clay.
In the northern parts, though it is in some places abundant-
ly rich, the climate is less favourable; the soil too, in many
places, being a clay bottom mixed with sand, is of inferior
quality, and less productive; it is now arable in general
not long since, a great part of it was taken from moors; in
dry seasons, however, it yields good crops; much wheat
and barley of excellent quality is raised in the southern
parts; pease and beans also, and every kind of grain that is
usual in this country, succeed well here.

   Agriculture, etc.-Though the farmers are not attached
to any particular mode of farming, the following is a rota-
tion of crops frequently obscrved here, wheat, turnip, or
any green crop, barley, and clover*.  There are few oats
raised in the lower part of the parish, but they are much
ased in the higher grounds.  Sometimes we stand in need
of importation of oats and oat-meal; while we export
considerable quantities of wheat, barley, pease and beans, and
some potatoes.  The late Earl of Balcarras, about 40 years
ago, introduced field turnip into his plan of farming, and
fed oxen with them to a great extent; the use of that va-
luable root was not perhaps sooner known in this part of
the country; his Lordship's example was but little follow-

<FOOTNOTE>

*Wheat is sown in September, October, November, some even in
January and February, which last is sometimes found to answer well:
It is reaped commonly in August and September.  Pease and beans are
sown in February, March, and beginning of April; barley generally in
May: And reaped in August, September, or sometimes beginning of
October.
