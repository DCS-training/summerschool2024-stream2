   The Scots fir being formerly supposed peculiarly suited to this,
climate, small clumps of it were planted on many of the farms, but
now with their branchless stems and tufted tops, only add to the
barenness of the scene.  Oak, asli, elm, beech, and plane, are the
kinds planted at present where the ground is dry; with alder,
birch larch, slpruce, and Scots fir, as nurses.  The management,
though in some places not very systematic, is allowed to be good.
The indigenous wood consists of oak, (cut down periodically for
the sale of the bark,) ash, elder, birch, elm, hazel, hawtbord, hag-
berry, mountain-ash, &c.
   The average rent of arable land in the parish is 15s. per acre;
of grazing, L. 5 per cow; of pasting, from 4s. 6d. to 5s. per
sheep.  The rental of the parish may be about L. 12,000.  Farm
servants with fimilies have, in lieu of maintenance, three loads
of meal, the produce of a cow, and a quantity of potatoes; be-
sides which, plouglmen receive on an average L. 9, and shep-
herds the keeping of 45 sheep, equivalent generally to L. 18.
The yearly wages of female servants vary from L. 5 to L. 7, exclu-
sive of their board.  Country artisans, as masons, carpenters, and
smiths, make per day from 2s. to 2s. 4d.; common labourers, as
roadmen, Is. 8d.  From the records of a society, it appears that
the average price of wool and sheep in Selkirk county, from 1826
to 1831 inclusive, has been as follows:-Clieviot wool per stone
of 24 lb.  English, smeared with tar, 10s. 7d.; do. smeared with
turpentine, 14s. 2d.; do. white or unsmdared, 17s.  Id.; stock
wetlier liogs iinclipt, 12s. 9d. ; stock ewe hogs unclipt, 14s. 2d.; ewe
hogs sold at market, 11s. 3d.; top weather lambs, 6s. 6d.; second
ewe and wether lambs, 5s. 3d.; draft ???, 12s. 8d.; wethers un-
clipt, 19s. 9d. ; wethers for turnip ferd 20s. 6d.
    Breeds of live Stoch, &c.-About the end of last century, the
black-faced breed of sheep was gradually supplanted by the Cheviot.
The experiment commenced on the lower farms, but from attachment
to established practice, and an idea that the lambs could not sustain
the cold or storms of spring, it was slowly extended, till the rising
value and demand for fine wool at length made it general.  Of late
