   Rent, Cultivation and Proprietors.-The valued rent of the
parish is 2983 L. Scotch.  The real rent may be upwards of
900 L. Sterling.  The rent of the several salmon fishings, on
the rivers and frith, may amount to 140 L. Sterling.  Much
of the arable land is dear.  In some parts of the parish, the
sowing of a boll of bear, (something more than a Scotch
acre,) pays 1 L. Sterling.  In many places the ground is fit
only for small black oats, of which three crops are taken on such
land, and then it is allowed to rest for 3, 4, or 5 years,
after which it is cropped again.  Very few experiments have
been made, to ascertain how lime would answer with such
ground.  There are 8 proprietors in the parish, of whom on-
ly 1 resides constantly.  One gentleman pays of rent 120 L.
Sterling.  One sheep farm is rented at 130 L.; but the ma-
jority of farms are possessed by small tenants.

   Crops and Produce.-The chief crops are barley, white
oats, small black oats, potatoes, and a very small quantity of
pease.  The oats are commonly sown in the last week of
March, and beginning of April; in the few large farms, the
oats are sown sooner, if the weather permits.  They usually
low bear in the beginning of May.  The people here are
come into the practice of cultivating potatoes to a consider-
able amount, and find their account in it; they raise as ma-
ny potatoes, as, at an average, may be sufficient to supply the
place of bread for four or five months in the year.  Some have
them until June, and they commonly begin to use them the
last week of August, and sometimes sooner.  They have proved
of the greatest benefit to this district.  Even when victual is
very scarce, and there is a great demand for bread, as soon
as the potatoes are fit for food, the demand stops instantly.
The parish produces, in tolerably good years, rather more vic-
tual than would be sufficient for supplying itself.-There are
