   Cattle.-They plow with horses of a small size, which are
brought from Strathnavern when two years old, and some
Shetland horses.  Three horses, or, at the most, four horses
are put into the plough.  These horses are, of value, from
3 L. Sterling to 4 L. never hardly above 5 L. Sterling.  There
are in the parish upwards of 200 ploughs.  There are a pro-
digious number of black cattle, no less than 2500, almost all
cows, from which they make grease butter.  The value of
the cows may be from 2 L. to 2 L. 10 s. hardly ever 3 L. Ster-
ling.-The sheep in this parish have fine wool, and, for the
most part, two lambs at a birth.  The sheep, when sold, cost
4 s. a head, or thereabout.  The number of small swine is
considerable, as are the flocks of geese.  The swine fell for
3 s. or 4 s. and the geese at 1 s.  There are no mice in the
island of Inhallow, and no rats in any one of the other
islands of the parish-There is a great quantity of kelp made
annually in this parish from May to July.  The people em-
ploy themselves at this work.  There is a little woollen stuff
made, and some linen, but to no amount.  These they trade
with to Shetland, and sell at the great annual market at
Kirkwall.
