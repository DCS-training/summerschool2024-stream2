wool finer, than those of the present breed.  Their want of weight
for the butcher, and greater difficulty and danger in lambing,
have banished them from this place.  The mutton of the present
breed is excellent; not large, weighing only from 10 to
12, or 15 pounds per quarter.  The market ig generally well
supplied with this and other articles of provision.  The price is
ruled by that of Dumfries.

   Population.-There are 220 families in the village of Mof-
fat, and 80 in the country part of the parish.  The number
of persons, young and old, rather above 1600.  In 1755, they
amounted 10 1612, according to the report made to Dr Web-
ster.
   There are no houses uninhabited.  Some new ones were late-
ly built in the village, and more are building at present; yet the
inhabitants can hardly be accomodated.
   As there are, as yet, no manufactures in Moffat, many
young persons of both sexes go to other places for employment.
An woollen manufacture is intended to be established soon;
and the necessary buildings were proposed to be erected in
summer, 1791.  As those who have engaged in this business,
are possessed of the important requisites of capital, judgement
and avtivity, and bear most respectable characters, it is hoped,
that they will succeed, to their own interest and honour, and
to the advantage of the neighbourhood, and of the public at
large.  In that event, more of our young people will find bu-
siness at home, and fewer will emigrate.
   There are, at present, in the village and parish of Moffat,
50 weavers, 6 shoemakers, 6taylors, 4 smiths, 8 merchants,
1 watch-maker, 2 bakers, 1 butcher, 1 barber, 5 masons, 6
wrights, 1 physician, 1 surgeon.
