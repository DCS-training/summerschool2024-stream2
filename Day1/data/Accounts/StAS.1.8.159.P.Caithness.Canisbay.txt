were wanting, in the choice of it as an habitation.  The de-
corations of art are alone wanting to render it one of the
loveliest spots in Caithness.  In the burn of Stempster, is found
white spar of the purest quality.  When put into the fire, a
very flight degree of heat makes it throw out a considerable
portion of phosphoric light, which gradually decays as the
stone cools, and is again recruited as the stone is heated
a-new.  When reduced to a powder, it puts on an exceeding
brilliant and beautiful appearance during ignition.  In elec-
trical experiments, it is a non-conductor, nor does it seem
soluble in acids.  About a quarter of a mile east from the
church, there are 2 springs of fresh water, at least 30 yards
within flood mark.  Betwixt Brabster and Freswick there is

some partridges, and multitudes of wild pigeons in the rocks.
Birds of passage are, the green plover, wild goose, snow-fowl,
wagtail, swallow and rail.  The snow-fowl, in the winter, are
inconceivably numerous.  The hills are exceedingly well

throughout the year, abound in multitudes of sea-fowl.  In
the summer months, the swarms of scarfs, marrots, faiks, etc.
that come to hatch in the rocks of Dungisbay and Stroma,
are prodigious.  They in a manner darken the air, when, on
