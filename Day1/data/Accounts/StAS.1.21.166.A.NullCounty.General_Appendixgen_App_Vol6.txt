   Soon after this Mr George Meikle of Alloa, a very skilful
and ingenious mill-wright, gave in a model of a wheel for
raising water entirely of a new construction, of his own
and his father's invention jointly.  This machine is so ex-
ceedingly simple, and acts in a manner so easy, natural, and
uniform, that a common observer is apt to undervalue the
invention: But persons skilled in mechanics view machinery
with a very different eye; for to them simplicity is the first
recommendation a machine can possess.  Accordingly, upon
seeing the model set to work, Mr Whirworth, with that
candour and liberality of mind that generally accompany ge-
nius and knowledge, not only gave it the greatest praise, but
declared that, for the purpose required, it was superior to
the machine recommended by himself, and advised it to be
adopted without hesitation.
   The better to explain this machine, two sketches are an-
nexed, to the first of which the following letters refer.  The
explanation of the second will be found upon the sketch.
   a. Sluice through which is admitted the water that moves
the wheel.
   b, b. Two sluices through which is admitted the water
raised by the wheel.
   c, c. A part of one of two wooden troughs and an aper-
ture in the wall, through which the above water is conveyed
into the buckets.  The other trough is hid by two stone
walls that support the wheel.]
   d, d, d. Buckets, of which 80 are arranged on each side
of the arms of the wheel = 160.
   e, e, e. A cistern, into which the water raised by the
buckets is discharged.
   f, f, f. Wooden barrel-pipes, through which the water
descends from the cistern underground, to avoid the high
road from Stirling and the private approach to the house.
