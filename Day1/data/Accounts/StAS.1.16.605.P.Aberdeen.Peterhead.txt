   They come in great crouds hither, from the distance of
30 or 40 miles; and in the higher parts of the county, ser-
vants frequently make it an article in their agreement with
their masters, to have 5 or 6 days of the Wine Well at
Peterhead, whether they have any complaints or not.
   Many have applied to me for advice.  In general they
say their complaints are gravelish; but, on enquiring more
minutely, it is flatulency and indigestion, which is com-

me to give the mineral water a preference to sea-water and
bathing in the sea.  Indeed, I know no disease, in the treat-

the alterations, that appear in the patient, depend so much
on the different seasons of the year, peculiarities of age, and
constitution, that what is merely the efforts of nature, is
frequently attributed to a medicine, which may be in
vogue, or may serve a present interest.
   Great exertions have been made for the accommodation
of the genteel company who resort hither on account of
