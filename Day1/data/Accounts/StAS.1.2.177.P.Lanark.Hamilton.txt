     NUMBER XV.

     PARISH OF HAMILTON.

     (COUNTY OF LANARK.)

   By MR. JOHN NAISMITH, Author of "Thoughts on
"Various Subjects of Industry pursued after in Scot
"land."

     Name, Extent, Situation, and Boundaries.

   THE parish probably derives its present appellation from
the noble family of that name, though vague tradition
gives it a different origin.  The whole district formerly seems
to have been called Cadzow.  It is situated in the centre of the
middle ward of the country of Lanark, and is the seat of the
presbytery which bears its name, subject to the superior juris-
diction of the synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  It is almost a square,
extending about six miles, from north-east to south-west, and
being about five miles from north-west to south east.  The ri-
ver Clyde runs along the east and north of the parish, forming
nearly the boundary, excepting in one place, where a large
corner is cut off on the north side of the river.  The parishes
by which it is bounded are Dalziel and Cambusnethan on the
east, Dalsers and Stonhouse on the south, Glasford and
Blantire on the west, and Bothwel on the north.
