	distant about eight miles, at an expense, including carriage, of
	2s. 4d. per barrel.  Wood is had at a reasonable rate from the
	thinnings of plantations.

	                       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	   The greater extent of ground now cultivated,and the immensely
	improved state of husbandry, constitute, perhaps, the most strik-
	ing difference between the present state of the parish, and its state
	at the time of the last Statistical Account.  Connected with this,
	and, in a great measure the cause of this improvement, is the put-
	ting down of the former practice of illegal distillation of spirits-than
	which, surely, never did any thing tend more to degrade and de-
	moralize a people. So prevalent was this twenty years ago, that
	no disgrace was attached to the practice; and families, in other
	respects of good repute, carried it on without any compunctions,
	save those arising from a fear of detection, and consequent punish-
	ment. Instead of the midnight watchings, during which excite-
	ments cannot be supposed to have been wanting, and habitual de-
	ceit resorted to, in order to conceal their practices, we have now
	the satisfaction of seeing the same people steadily pursuing the
	improvement of their lands, elevated in their moral tone and bear-
	ing, their outward appearance giving evidence of a healthy tem-
	perament and ameliorated condition.
