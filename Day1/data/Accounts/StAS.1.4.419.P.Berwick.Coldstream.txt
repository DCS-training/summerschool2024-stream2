and by Leet on the N.  The greatest land-flood remem-
bered by the oldest people then alive, happened in May
1783.-A very remarkable thunders-storm happened in

and scientific account of which, by Captain Brydone, is to
be found in the Philosophical Transactions of London.-
There are two obelisks in the parish, which were both e-
rected by Alexander the late Earl Of Home.  The one

sisting of two arches, over the water Leet.  The other lar-
