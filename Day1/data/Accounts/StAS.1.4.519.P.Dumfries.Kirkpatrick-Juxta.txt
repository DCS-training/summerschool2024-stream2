tured except in the latter end of the year.  Moss accumulates
very quickly upon stones when exposed to the weather, and
likewise upon trees.  There are in tillage 4 8 acres; for po-
tatoes 35 acres; barley and big 20; almost all the rest for
oats.  There are of black cattle 625; sheep 448 scores, horses
95.  The black cattle in this country are small, and mostly
without horns; for the want of which, they are commonly
preferred.  The sheep are all of the short kind, large, but
coarse woolled.  They are tarred very thick, about a Scots
pint of tar being allowed to 5 sheep.  The English sheep
are coming into repute in the neighbourhood.  Lord Hope-
toun keeps a few Spanish, which thrive pretty well.  In
general, the parish must be presumed to export provisions.
But a very few acres are sown with rye-grass and clover.
The whole of the parish, except about 600 acres, is in pasture.
They sow from the beginning of March to the middle of A-

land-rent of the parish is about L. 1827.  There are about 40
plounghs, almost all of the Scotch kind, and as many carts.  Al-
most every farm in the parish having a considerable variety
of soil, it can only be computed that the arable land, if let
separately, would rent from 6 s. to 14 s.; good bog meadow,
as it requires little trouble or expence, might yield 12 s.or
14 s.  There is no land capable of tillage, let exclusively
for pasture.  The highest rent in the parish is that of a
sheep farm, viz. L. 220.  Other sheep farms are rented at
L. 100, and upwards.  These have all more or less of arable
land, from 8 to 30 acres.  The average rent of those farms,
on which there are no sheep, is L. 25.  The number of
these is increasing.-In 1782 and 1783, much corn was ex-
ported from this county both by land and sea.  The oat-
meal sold then at 2 s. 6 d. the stone.  The poor certainly
