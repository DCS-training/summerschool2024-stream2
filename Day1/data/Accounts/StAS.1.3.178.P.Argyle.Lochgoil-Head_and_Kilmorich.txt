few strangers who came to settle among them with an evil
eye; and this rendered them more averse to follow their ex-
ample.  But a short time reconciled them to their system,
and convinced them of the superior advantage of sheep to
black cattle.  From that time, therefore, the number of
sheep  has been encreasing, and that of black cattle decreas-
ing.  It is believed, that there are at present about 26,500
sheep in this parish.  The few strangers who came to settle
here, brought with them the breed of sheep which they
had in their own country, and the sheep  which have been
introduced since, from time to time, were chiefly brought
from the Linton market.  It is said that there are principally
two kinds of sheep at that market.  The long tailed white faced
sheep, are a mongrel breed. a mixture of the scots and the
heavy English breeds; these have never been found to thrive in
this country.  The other is the black faced short tailed kind:
these answer here well, and improve greatly the first few years.
The proprietors of sheep in this district are very attentive to
change the breed of their rams.  Without this precaution, a
sheep stock is found to degenerate very soon.  They are also
convinced that it would be of advantage to change their hogs,
i. e. one year old sheep; and some of them are resolved to
make the experiment.  They seldom keep a ram above three,
never above four years old.  With regard to the ewes, it is
found very unprofitable to keep them longer than six years;
they commonly begin to degenerate at four.  Indeed, the
younger the breeding sheep are, it is the better for the flock,
both with regard to carcase and wool.  The rams are re-
moved from the ewes the first day after the 10th of Octo-
ber, and kept separate from a month to six weeks, conse-
quently the ewes lamb between the 1st and 20th of April.
The sheep in this contry run wild through the mountains,
but they must be gathered at least four times in the year.
