     Statistical Account

No proper record of deaths or burials has been yet kept in
this parish, but the average of them is believed not to ex-
ceed 30.  The register of baptisms and marriages, previous
to 1787, appears to have been so carelessly and imperfectly
made up, that no conclusions can be drawn from it with
any degree of certainty.  But of an exact register for five
years past, the following abstract may be depended on.
