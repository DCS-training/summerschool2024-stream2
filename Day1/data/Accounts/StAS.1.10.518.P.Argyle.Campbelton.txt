south, is computed* to be 11 miles; its breadth at the north
end about 6, a and the south and about 10.  It is narrowed
about the middle, where the two seas verge towards one ano-
ther; the bay of Machir-hanish running in, a considerable
way on the one side, and the loch of Kilkerran, or harbour
of Campbelton, on the other.  The space between the two
is occupied by a large plain, of about 4 miles in length and 3
in breadth, sand not above 40 feet above the level of the sea.

   Soil.-This plain consists partly of sand covered with bent,
and a thin but fine pile of grass; partly of arable and marsh,
of which some has been drained; but principally of moss,
some of which has been, and more may yet be, improved.
Both ends of the parish, to the north and south of this flat,
are hilly, rising gradually to 1000 or 1200 feet above the
level of the sea.  The skirts of the hills, and some valleys
near their summits, are cultivated; but the surface is in ge-
neral covered with heath.  The soil is of various kinds, deep
or shallow, according to its altitude or declension, and much
of it wet or spouty.  In general, however, the arable land
is light and warm, and, when compared with other parts of
the Highlands, may be called fertile.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate is mild, but the air is
often moist.  We have frequent rains, little frost, and sel-
dom any snow.  The frost is not often so intense as to sink the
thermometer 8 degrees below Fahrenheit's freezing point.
The people have few diseases, except the rheumatism, which
is ascribed to the moisture of the atmosphere, and putrid
fevers, which often visit the inhabitants in spring, in com-
