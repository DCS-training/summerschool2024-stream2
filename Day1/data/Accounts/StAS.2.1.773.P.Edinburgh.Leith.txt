			     LEITH.                          773.

An extensive distillery is in operation at Bonnington, and brew-
eries in Leith and vicinity.
   Trade and Commerce.-Both the home and foreign trade of the
port are on an extensive scale. The foreign trade is carried on
with Russia, Hamburgh, Holland, Denmark, and Sweden, as also
with various parts of the Mediterranean, America, East and West
Indies, New Holland, and China. Formerly, a considerable ten-
nage of shipping was engaged in the Greenland whale trade, but
of late this has greatly fallen off. A comparative view of the
progress of trade during the last century is exhibited by the fol-
lowing list of the shipping belonging to and engaged in the com-
merce of Leith.
