which about 1640 are fed upon that part of them belonging
to this parish.  The mutton, and especially the wool, produ-
ced upon the Ochils, (as they are sometimes called,) is consi-
dered as of a superior quality; particularly that upon the farm
called Craiginnan, which is the property of the Duke of AR-
GYLL. Towards the foot of the hills, the soil, in general, is
light and gravelly, causing a quick vegetation.  In dry sea-
sons, it is indeed apt to be parched; but in wet seasons, the
crops are moderately good. The greater part of the flat-ly-
ing ground in the bottom is likewise of a light gravely na-
nature, and usually yields rather an early harvest.  Along
the banks of the Dovan, the soil is mostly of the haugh
kind; and some of it a deep clay.  Upon the south side of
the Dovan, the ground is rather wettish and clayey, but, with
proper attention and culture, it is capable of very considera-
ble improvement.  And some of the farms, which are under
proper management, make very good returns.

   Produce, Seasons, etc.-The ordinary crops raised in this
parish, are barley, oats, pease, beans, and potatoes. There
is also some wheat and hay; but not much.  The usual time
of sowing oats, pease, and beans, in this parish, in ordinary
seasons, is the months of March and April, and the barley
in May.  It is usually over by the 20th of the month.-The
harvest commonly begins towards the end of August, or be-
ginning of September; and, excepting some late spots, is
over by the tenth of October.  As soon as the barley, oats,
and pease are got in, the potatoes are taken up and housed,
which concludes the harvest work.

   Improvements.-Agriculture, in this parish, until within
these few years, has continued much in the same state that
it was about 150 years ago; the feuers, who possess the
