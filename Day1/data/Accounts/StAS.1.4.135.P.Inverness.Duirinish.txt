bolls and 3 sirlots, which was a most seasonable relief to
the poorer sort of people.

   Price of Provisions and Labour, etc.-As there are no
flesh-markets, if a person is disposed to eat beef, he must
buy a whole cow; if he would wish to have mutton, he
must buy a sheep.  A cow costs from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, 
10 s. a sheep 6 s.  Butter, when it can be procured, from
10 s. to 12 s. cheese 4 s. the stone weight.  Domestic men-
servants yearly wages are from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, exclu-
sive of 4 pair of shoes to each.  A grieve (or overseer) has
from L. 4 to L. 7, besides his shoes.  Women-servants have
from 8 s. to 20 s. besides 3 pair of shoes.  When a man-
servant marries, and engages in service for a year, he has
for wages as much ground as he can labour, grass for 2
milk-cows, a dozen of sheep and 2 horses, and 2 days in
the week to do his own work, besides his victuals every
day he works to his master.  Every married labourer in 
this country has a small portion of land, he raises a little
flax, and has a few sheep, so that his wife furnishes him
with his whole wearing apparel.  Were he to buy yearly,
as he would require, a bonnet at 1 s. 6 d. 3 1/2 yards of coarse
cloth for a great coat, at 2 s. 6 d. the yard, 5 yards of the 
same for a jacket, waist-coat and 2 pair of breeches, 4 pair
of shoes at 2 s. 6 d. each, 3 pair of hose, and so in propor-
tion for his wife and children; also 12 bolls of meal for
himself, wife and children, at 17 s. the boll, 1/2 barrel of salt,
at 5 s. 1/2 stone of iron at 2 s. together with some other un-
avoidable little charges, it would be found that the yearly
expence of a labourer and his family in the Isle of Sky,
could not be much less than L. 20 Sterling.

   Antiquities.-There are the remains of 2 Roman Catholic
chapels, one in Trumpar in Vaternish, and another in Glen-
