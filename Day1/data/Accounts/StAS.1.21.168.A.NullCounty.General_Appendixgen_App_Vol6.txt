sometimes to carry the water clean over the cistern, sometimes
to drop it entirely behind, but seldom so as fully to discharge
the whole contents of the buckets into the cistern.
   It is however but candid to remark, that this machine la-
bours under a small defect, which did not escape the ob-
servation of Mr Whitworth; namely, that by raising the wa-
ter about 3 1/2 feet higher than the cistern where it is ultimate-
ly delivered, a small degree of power is lost.  To this in-
deed he proposed a remedy; but candidly confessed, that,
as it would render the machine somewhat more complex,
and would also increase the friction, he thought it more ad-
visable to keep it in its present state.  At the same time he
justly observed, that as the stream by which the wheel is
moved is at all times copious and powerful, the small loss of
power occasioned by the above circumstances was of little or
no avail.
   This stream is detached from the Teith at the place where
that river approaches nearest to the moss.  The surface of the
latter is about 15 feet higher than that of the former; the
cistern is therefore placed 17 feet above the surface of the
stream, so as to leave a declivity sufficient to deliver the
water upon the surface of the moss.
   The pipes through which the water descends from the cis-
tern are composed of wooden barrels hooped with iron 4 feet
long and 18 inches in diameter within.
   In these pipes, having been conveyed under ground for
354 yards from the cistern, the water at once emerges into
an open aqueduct.  This aqueduct, which was formed accord-
ing to a plan by Mr. Whitworth, is constructed wholly of
earth or clay; and in order to keep the water on a level with
the surface of the moss; it is for nearly two thirds of its
course elevated from 8 to 10 feet above the level of the ad-
jacent grounds; the base being 40 feet broad, the summit 18
