not for the expense of coal, which must all, be brought at great  ex-

	Soil.--The soil is varied. On the higher parts of the island,
it is light, gravelly, and thin, tending to moss, bedded on rock, and
covered  with heath; but in some of the valleys it consists of rich
black loam of considerable depth, bedded on clay of various de-
scriptions,and producing good crops. All along the coast, however,
it is light and sandy, bottomed generally on rock or clay. On the
south end of the island, it abounds with marl, and, excepting in
very dry seasons, produces crops of the most excellent quality.
	Zoology.--From the insular situation, and limited extent of the
parish, there are no spacies of wild animals found here, excepting
rabbits, of which there are great abundance; hares once existed in
the island, but are now completely extirpated; and the domesticani-
mals are only such as are common to all the surrounding parishes.
The shores and bays all round the island abound with fish of va-
rious kinds, the chief of which are, haddock, cod, whitings, lyth,
mackerels, salmon-trout, and herrings. These last, however, have,
of late years, greatly diminished, so much so, indeed, that herring-
fishing, as such, has been almost totally abandoned. Shell-fish
are plenty, and are of some advantage to the inhabitants. They
include all the varieties found on the neighbouring shores, and
others also which are not so common, such as;

Oysters are also occasionally found in small quantities, but are lit-
the valued by the people. The species, of sponge, Halichondria
infundibuliformia, is also found here.
	Of zoophytes, there are great variety, such as,
Authes Tuadise             Cornularia rugosa          Hippothea catennlaria
Antennularia antennina     Sertularia pumila          Lucernaria fascicularis

           cilista         Flustra membrancea                cornuta
           pumicosa                piloea                    luxata
	Botany.--All the plants which are found in the neighbouring
parishes are found here in great abundance, and many others wich
are of less frequent occurrance, such as--
