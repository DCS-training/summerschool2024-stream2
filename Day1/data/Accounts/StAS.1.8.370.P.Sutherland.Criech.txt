   Ecclesiastical State.-There is not one person in this parish,
who does not belong to the established church.  There was a
missionary minister settled for upwards of 25 years, in the
heights of the parishes of Criech and Kincardine, who
preached every third Sabbath in the high grounds of Creech.
He had a salary of 25 L. Sterling, from his majesty's royal boun-

miles of the parish of Criech were under this mission; but
it was discontinued, and the salary removed, at Whitsunday

different presbyteries, the number of the inhabitants, and
their eager desire for the means of instruction, and for having
the ordinances of the gospel administered among them, (on
which they punctually attend,) pled loudly for the continu-
ance of the mission.  This would have been a great hardship
on the people, as well as on the ministers of their parishes,
had not the knowledge of the case excited the compassion and
sympathy of Lady Ross Baillie; who, out of her own liberality,
has appointed a permanent million in this extensive district,
with a better salary than was afforded by the Committee; to-

sufficiently comfortable.
   The stipend of the established minister is 72 bolls of victual,
one half oat meal and the other half bear; 25 L. Sterling in
money, and  1 L. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling for grass.  The decreet was
obtained for the stipend in 1708.  The parish can bear a great
