     Statistical Account

Ochil-hills and elevated situations in the counties of Stir-
ling, Fife, and Linlithgow.  Toward the N. W. the tops
of some of the Highland hills are to be seen, involved in
clouds, and at certain seasons of the year covered with
snow, when none of it is to be seen elsewhere within the
whole compass of our prospect.  A part of the frith of
Forth, presenting itself to view, and the vessels, passing on
the canal, within a mile of Falkirk, enhance considerably
the beauty of the scene.
   When this prospect is involved in the darkness of night,
the flashes of light from the iron-works at Carron, appear
in awful and sublime majesty.  When a fall of rain or
snow is soon to happen, the light is refracted by the thick
and moist atmosphere, and considerable illuminations ap-
pear in the air above the works.  These are seen at a con-
siderable distance, and great flashes of light are thrown into
the houses in this neighbourhood, which have windows to-
ward the Carron works.  Upon the eminence on the S.
of Falkirk, the prospect not only comprehends the whole
view which I have described, but also the scenery about
Callander house, to which I have already alluded; the ves-
sels in the harbour of Grangemouth; the masts of those in
that of Borrowstounness; the ruins of the palace of Lin-
lithgow; the steeples of that town, and those of Dun-
fermline; together with a variety of striking objects on
both sides of the frith of Forth, as well as those which ap-
pear in other points of the prospect.
