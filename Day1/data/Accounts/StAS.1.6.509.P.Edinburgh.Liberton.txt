sides the bleachfield at Pessermill.  The grounds of Liberton,
in general, independant of the advantages of manure from the
city, are as fruitful as any in the neighbourhood.  The si-
tuation is healthful, and many arrive to a great age.-The
valuation of the parish, being the real rent in 1649, is
L. 13,685: 6: 8 Scotch; the real rent at present amounts to
L. 10,000 sterling.  The upper part of the inhabitants are so-
ber, regular, exemplary, and have always shewn a particular
regard to the interests of the poor.  The lower sort are often
noisy and clamorous, and are rather of violent passions, but
soon pacified and appeased.  Their morals, in general, are
not so unexceptionable as could be wished; and no wonder,
when they live in the neighbourhood of such a city as Edin-
burgh.

   Miscellaneous Observation.-In this parish are the principal
seats of the two oldest families in Mid-Lothian, the Wauchopes
of Niddry Marshall, and the Lords Somerville; the former
having been seated here for more than 400 years, and the lat-
ter having acquired the estate of Drum in this parish in 1375,
by marriage, possesses it at this day.  Craigmitlar Castle, a favo-
rite residence of Queen Mary, is in this parish, and makes a
most venerable appearanace.
