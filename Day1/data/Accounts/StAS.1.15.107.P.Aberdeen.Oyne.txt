multures, and it is hoped he will be imitated by the other
proprietors in the neighbourhood.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air, in general, is pure and
very healthy, and few epidemical diseases prevail.  The
rheumatism is the most common disorder, which, in this
district, is felt more by people of better station, than by the
poorer sort of people.

   Forest and Fruit Trees-There is a great number of large
ash, plane, beech, birch, elm, oak, pine, fir, walnut and
chesnut trees, all above 60 years old, near the house of West-
hall.  There is likewise a very great number of apple, pear,
cherry, geen and plumb trees, which, though much neglec-
ted for these 40 years, commonly bear fruit.  There are
some very large old Scotch firs near the house,* and, half a
mile distance from it, there are two thriving plantations of
young Scotch firs.
   There is likewise a large plantation of Scotch firs on that
part of the estate of Pittodry, which lies in this parish.  At
Tillyfour there is a considerable number of fruit and other
kinds of trees, besides two large plantations; the one of
Scotch firs, and the other of hazel.  It is a most beautiful
mantie place, and a very pleasant summer seat.

*Mr JOHN HORN, Advocate, about 90 years ago, beautified this place
Very much with several plantations of firs, which throve so well, that it is
said he himself was buried in a coffin, made out of a fir tree of his own plan-
ting.  He likewise made out a fine avenue from the entry of his house,
which at last ascends a pretty little green hill, on the top of which he built a small lodge, of two rooms, and called it PARNASSUS.  He ornamented his
seat with a great number of pleasure walks, with statues in them, which
snow a great deal of taste, considering how long it is since these walks were
find out.
