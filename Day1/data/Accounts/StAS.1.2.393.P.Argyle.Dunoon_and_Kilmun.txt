   From comparing the number of our births, with our deaths
and marriages, it is evident, that many born in the parish re-
move from it, both before and after marriage, and never re-
turn.  Many, in particular, go into the naval and military
service of their country, especially into the navy; into which
it is said, 90 young men went from one district of the parish,
during the American war.

   Nothing else occurs, that seems to merit attention; though
a more accurate observer might probably discover many other
facts, worthy of being communicated to the public, and might
be able to draw many inferences from them, equally curious
in themselves, and interesting to the country.
