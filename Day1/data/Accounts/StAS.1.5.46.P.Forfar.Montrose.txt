     Statistical Account

   Convinced, also, of the importance of an early Christian
education, the church-session send a number of poor children
to school, and pay for their education, till they are able, at
least, to read the scriptures.  There are, at present, about
50 such on the roll.  They are at different schools, which
are visited annually, that their progress in learning may be
ascertained.

   Ecclesiastical State.-There are few people in Montrose,
who do not, occasionally, at least, attend some place of pu-
blic worship.  The great body of the people are presbyte-
rians.  Hitherto, there has been only one church belonging
to the establishment; but it is large, and much crowded.
The charge is collegiate.  The stipend of the senior clergy-
man, is in money L. 48: 14: 1 11/12, with 48 bolls 3! firlots
2 /4 pecks of bear, 55 bolls 2 firlots 2 1/4 pecks meal, and 3
bolls 2 firlots of wheat, but without a manse or glebe.  The
stipend of the second minister arises from an annuity, laid
on houses within the royalty, by act of Parliament, at the
rate of 5 per cent. of yearly rent.  It amounts, at present,
to upwards of L. 100; and if levied with stritness, would
considerably exceed the stipend of the first charge.
   The following, is as accurate an account, of the numbers
belonging to the religious sects, in this place, as could well
be obtained.
