most common rent is from 70 l. to 120 l. per annum.  In,
deed, in Buittle, property of the landed fort is not ill divid-
ed either among the landholders or the tenantry.  There
are 15 heritors in the parish;-the largest estate is about
1000 l. per annum and there is only one below 70 l.

   Fuel, Cultivation, and Produce.-From a port in the Urr, at
Barlochan, or Garden Creek, the greater part of the parish is,
supplied with lime.  That port lies on the east side of the
parish, and is centrical.  At Munshes, about a mile farther
up the river, some is also landed.  Lately (and most time-
ously) coal has been imported at a reasonable rate, namely, at
10 d. the Carlisle bushel.  While this country retains its so-

by whose interposition and efforts this desirable event has
been brought about.-Tillage and pasturage are almost e-
qually objects to the farmer here.  The greatest tillage per-
mitted is one third of the arable, which is certainly more
than is profitable.  After liming, three white crops are taken,
two of oats, and a third of barley.  If, after the third white
crop, the farmer dungs and has a green crop, a fourth white
crop is permitted, when the ground is always sown out with
red clover and rye-grass, the only foreign grasses propagated.
White clover, and the perennial red, are so common in the
fields, and rise naturally in such plenty, that the bought seeds
of these plants are seldom used.  Not much wheat is sown.
The soil, though kindly, is light; but that is not the only
reason.-The straw of wheat is not used as fodder in this
part of the country, though it is in England; and this, to a
farmer in these parts, is a great draw-back on a crops as most
of the farms can maintain more cattle in summer, than can
be provided with food in winter: For the same reason, sal-
