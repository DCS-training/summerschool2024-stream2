but yield little other benefit to the inhabitants.  The sea-
ware is of little value.  There is only one boat's crew of
fishermen, who are neither skilful nor adventurous:  they are
therefore wretchedly poor, and of little or no advantage to
the place; while others from Murray and Banff-shire, catch
fish on this coast, and make money, by carrying away the
cod, haddocks, scate, flounders, &c.  At the Little Ferry,
there is an excellent harbour, where ships lie in perfect secu-
rity, after having got over a bar, which runs across the en-
trance.  At high water, vessels of 500 tons burthen may
enter here.  At the shore of Dornoch, too, small vessels lie
in safety, with tolerable weather, as well as near the Meikle
Ferry; but a formidable bar stretches from the eastern point
of the coast of Dornoch, almost quite over to the south side
of the frith, called (from their incessant noise) the Gizzing
Briggs.  The banks forming this bar, are not, however, so
closely connected, but that vessels of considerable burthen
(perhaps 300 tons) may enter, under the direction of a pilot.
The shores are flat and sandy, and the lands contiguous to
them generally level; but gradually elevated as they approach
the hilly districts to the north.  The soil is sandy; the pre-
valence of that quality decreasing in proportion to the distance
from the shore.  The higher grounds in culture, partake of
moss; of the clay kind, there is little in the parish.  The air
here, is pure and salubrious, if we except the immediate
vicinity of a large morass, extending from the town of Dor-
noch upwards of two miles to the westward, and lying along
the county road.  This has been a common.  Some years ago,
a scheme of division was formed, under the authority of the
Court of Session:  It was accordingly divided among the pro-
prietors of the adjacent lands, and march stones set up; but
still it lies undrained, and a nuisance, as before.  Some feeble
