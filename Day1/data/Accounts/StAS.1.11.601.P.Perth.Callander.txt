oats, which generally yield a boll of meal for every boll of
grain.  Barley is the most valuable crop raised by the farmers
in this district.  That which has two rows in the ear is the
best grain, and is commonly called barley; that which consists
of four rows, is more prolific in light soils, and affords more
bolls upon an acre.  The Russian barley of six rows, and the
naked or Siberian barley, have been tried, but have fallen into
disuse, on account of the smallness of their profit, and the bad-
ness of the straw.

   Green Crops, etc.-We have two kinds of pease; the one
early, and the other late.  Wheat is not much cultivated.
Flax is raised in considerable quantities, and makes good re-
turns.  Potatoes are cultivated to a great extent; and have
very much supplanted the turnips as a fallow, where barley and
grass seeds are to be sown for the succeeding crop.  The grasses
sown are rye-grass, red, white, and sometimes yellow clover,
and narrow plantane or rib grass.

   Agriculture.-The soil of this country is by no means rich;
but it is capable of great improvement, and makes good re-
turns.  The style of the farmers houses is much improved
within these 20 years.  In this district the farmers often plow
their ground with two horses, which the ploughman drives
and manages with long reins.  In some cases we see 4 horses
yoked in a long plough, and a boy driving them; and even
the broad plough, with 4 horses yoked abreast, is not entirely
exploded.  In stony ground the Scotch plough is preferred;
but in other land, the farmers generally use curved mold
boards, small socks fixed upon an iron sole, and regulate the
draught entirely by the muzzle.  The harrows are common,
except that in some cases they use large breakers, with teeth
like small plough-shares, fixed above the bills, with an iron slit-
