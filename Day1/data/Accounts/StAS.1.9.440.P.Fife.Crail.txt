West, without forming any hill or remarkable acclivity.
The few trees and hedges here are reared with difficulty,
and have an unhealthy appearance.  The strong breezes
from the sea contribute much to retard their growth.  They
thrive best at Ardrie, which has encouraged the present
proprietor to make several additional plantations.  The
soil is excedingly various.  It is found of all kinds, from
the richest deep black loam, and driest sharp channel, to the
poorest thin wet clay.  The value is consequently as va-
rious, from 3 s. or 4 s. to L. 1, L. 2, L. 3, L. 4, and in one
instance to L. 5 an acre.  The manures employed are lime,
dung, and sea ware; which last is cast upon the shore in
great quantities; and upon many fields produces as good
crops of barley, wheat, and turnips, as can be raised from
dung.

   Agriculture, etc.-In the mode of farming, there is no-
thing peculiar to this parish.  The crops, and their rotation,
are in general the same as along the rest of the coast of
Fife.  The ploughs are of the new construction, and uni-
versally drawn by two horses.  No threshing mills are yet
erected.  Where the land is good, potatoes are generally
planted as a preparation for wheat.  An acre may produce
from 40 to 60 bolls; 1500 or 2000 bolls are annually ex-
ported to the foreign and English markets, from 4 s. to 6 s.
the boll.  The trades people frequently rent small portions
of land from the farmers, which they plant with this useful
root.  At their leisure hours they hoe and dress their little
lots, an exercise which contributes both to their interest and
to their health.  In this way, after supplying the family, a
few bolls are frequently procured for sale.  The rent, when
paid in money, maybe at the rate of L. 3 or L. 4 an acre; but
a more common way is for the tradesmen to give the seed
and labour, allowing the farmer half the produce.  Drilled
