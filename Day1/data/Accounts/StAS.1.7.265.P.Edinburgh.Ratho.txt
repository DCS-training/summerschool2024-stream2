nibus annis.  The glebe consists of near 9 acres, whereof 5 is
meadow ground, of no great value; but the whole, with the
manse and garden, may be reckoned equal to 20 L. a year;-
The schoolmaster's salary, about 25 years ago, was only 8 L
3 s. Sterling.  Upon an application to the heritors, they aug-
mented it to 13 L. 3 s.  About 10 years ago, the school-
master being rendered unfit, by age, for the duties of his of-
fice, most of the heritors voluntarily agreed to double the
salary, and raised it to about 24 L. of which 10 L. with a free
house, was alloted to the old schoolmaster for life, and 14 L.
established as a salary for an efficient teacher, the choice of
whom was left to the minister.  Ever since there has been at
Ratho a numerous and thriving school; and within these two
years, the heritors have expended above 150 L.  Sterling in
enlarging the schoolmaster's house and rebuilding the school;
which is finished and furnished in so complete a manner, that
it may be considered as a model for other parts of the coun-
try, there being few such in Scotland.

for exigencies.  There have been, almost ever since, however,
about 40 indigent persons, at an average, regularly supplied,
to the extent of near 70 L.  Sterling annually, which sum has
been produced altogether from weekly collections at the
church doors.  This may appear incredible in so small a pa-
rish; but one circumstance, which deserves to be recorded, to
the honour of the late noble patron, will explain it.  The late
Earl of Lauderdale, who was remarkable, in his rank, for reli-
gious decency, and for his regular attendance on public ordinan-
ces, gave, every Sabbath, a guinea of collection, and still more
liberal donations on sacramental occasions; so that, in the way
of weekly collection, in little more than 30 years, he gave at
