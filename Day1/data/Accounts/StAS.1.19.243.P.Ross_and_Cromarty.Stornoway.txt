at a considerable cost, because all the materials are import-
ed, the stones not excepted, and therefore such as are va-
cant must be set to tenants for higher rest than in most
other places.  Good houses are let at from L. 15 to L. 25
per annum, and rooms and lesser dwellings in like propor-

acre yearly.

   Schools-There are two well-frequented schools in the
town, provided with able teachers, good accommodation,
and good salaries.  The one is parochial, and the other is
supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Know-
ledge.  The yearly salary of the parochial school is L.40,
of which the master has L. 25, and his assistant L. 15.  The
master has, together with the emoluments of his school, a 
dwelling-house and garden rent-free, and some land from
the proprietor.  The fees are, per quarter, for English and
writing, 2s. 6d.; for arithmetic and English, 3s.; for
Latin, writing, arithmetic together, 4s; for a course of
geography, 10s.6d.; for navigation, L.1, 1s.; and for
each set of book-keeping, 10s.6d.  The number of scho
lars is 40.  The Society schoolmaster's dwelling-house and
school-house are lately built with stone and lime, and cover-

the master, and L. 8 to his assistant.  The quarter fees are,
for reading, I s. 6d.; writing, 2 s.; arithmetic, 2 s, 6 d.;
book-keeping, 5s. ; mensuration, 5s.;  navigation, 10s.
The number of scholars is 129.
   Besides these, there is spinning-school established by the
Society; the accommodation consisting of a garden and a
slated house, with L. 6 salary granted by Seaforth, and L. 4
salary from the Society, to the mistress.  To this school,
