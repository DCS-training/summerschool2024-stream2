  Character and Habits of the People.--The inhabitants are late-
ly much improved in point of cleanliness and dress. Their arti-
cles of diet, which formerly consisted chiefly of potatoes and oat-
meal, now embrace a greater variety. Instead of the homely ban-
nock, kneaded at his own hearth, you find the cottager enjoying his
loaf from the baker, which he accompanies with beer, milk, or tea.
Pork and rabbit during winter, fish and cockles during summer,
constitute at once a rich and varied diet. By furnishing manure to
the neighbouring farmers, the villagers obtain abundant crops of
potatoes at an easy rate. They get a certain portion of land, in which
they deposit their own sets, and cultivate and clean the land during
the summer months, which tends much to promote their health and
enjoyment. Indeed, our villagers are in possession of many privi-
leges and comforts which are denied to the inhabitants of wealthier
towns; and, on the whole, they are a contented, industrious, intel-
ligent, religious, and happy people. The demoralizing practice
of smuggling, formerly so extensively prevalent on the shore, has,
by the operation of the excise laws, been abolished for many years.
  During the last three years, there have been 9 illegitimate
births in the parish.

  Agriculture.--In this parish agriculture is conducted in the most
approved style. The deep soils undergo regular rotation by alter-
nate husbandry. The five or six years' course is observed on the
loams and deep clays; the eight years' rotation suits the lighter or
weaker soils; by allowing the land to rest in pasture for two, three,
or more years. On these, turnips are often flaked and eat off by
sheep, which is found a prodigious improvement to the soil.
Draining of all kinds is universally practised. By the large drain
