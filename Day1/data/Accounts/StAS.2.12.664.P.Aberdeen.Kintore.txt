steadily increasing.  The tide-lock, an important addition, was
completed in 1834.  There is a small wbarf at the town of Kin-
tore, as well as at the canal head.
  At Port Elphinstone there are mills, on a very extensive
scale, for grinding all sorts of grain; and the enterprising pro-
prietor of these works, Mr Tait of Criebie sends the meal
there manufactured to all parts of the kingdom.  There are also
in that village two saw-mills, one driven by steam and the other
by water power.  Since the last census of the parish of Kin-
tore, there has been a great increase of the population at Port
Elphinstone; and as the trade on the canal is daily extend-
ing, of which it forms the principal depot, it is likely to be-
come more and more a place of general resort.  Besides the
mills already alluded to, it contains several large granaries, some
wood-yards, and numerous storehouses for lime, coals, bone man-
ure, and various other commodities, conveyed to or from Aber-
deen by the barges. *
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church stands in the town of
Kintore.  It occupies a centrical situation in reference to the po-
pulation, but not in reference to the extent of the parish, being
very near the boundary towards Keithhall and Fintray.  The
most distant parts, however, are not more than four miles from it.
The church was built in 1819, and is at present in excellent re-
pair.  It affords sufficient accommodation for 700 people.  It is
quite large enough for the parish as yet, and, on the whole, con-
venient; though the plan may be exceptionable in some respects,
and particularly in the arrangement for dispensing the communion.
All the sittings are appropriated.  The country parishioners are
amply provided for, but the inhabitants of the town have too li-
mited a number assigned them.
   The manse was built in 1784, and repaired in 1835-6; new
offices were erected the previous year.  The glebe consists of two se-
parate pieces of ground.  That portion adjacent to the manse mea-
sures 6 acres, and the soil being gnod, it might be let for L.3 per
acre.  The other part, containing nearly 2 acres, lies at a
considerable distance, and is of an inferior quality.  The stipend is
112 bolls of meal, 33 bolls of barley, and L.87, 9s. 10d. in money,
