   Produce, Exports, etc.-The principal crops raised in this
parish, are oats, barley, flax, and potatoes.  Of late, they
have sown some pease, rye, wheat, grass feeds, and turnips,
all of which do very well.  As the produce, especially of the
fore part of the parish, is much greater than is necessary for
the consumption of its inhabitants, considerable quantities of
butter, cheese, meal, mutton, beef, pork, oat-meal, barley,
and potatoes, are disposed of in the towns and places adja-

   Horses, Black-cattle, Sheep, and Wool.-The cattle are all of
the small kind, but good of their sizes.  All the high priced
cattle belong to the low part of the parish, and are rear-
ed in gentlemen's parks.  Grazing cattle is now become
more common than it was formerly.  The farmers in gene-

Stock (as they term it,) alive.  They keep from 2 to 6 work-
ing horses, each, and from 3 to 6, and some even 10 or 12
milk cows.  It is believed, that there are 10,000 sheep in
the parish.  They are of the Scotch beed, and very hardy.
Their wool is good, and their flesh very sweet.  The aver-
age prices of cattle, wool, etc. are as follows:
