   Roads.-Till of late years there were few roads through the
shire of Air that were barely passable.  About the year 1774
an act of Parliament was obtained, commuting the statute la-
bour for an annual payment, at the rate of 25 s. for every
L. 100 Scots of valued rent.  Through the interior, more
populous, and arable parts of the country the roads were
soon made; and by the assistance of government and a toll,
one good road has been made through this parish:  But it is
little more than a road of communication.  The parish wants
cross roads in different directions, in order to enable them to
lead lime in carts, of which there is plenty within half a 
mile of the extremity of the parish:  It is sold at the mode-
rate price of 7 1/2 d. a boll or 2 Winchester bushels, and 70 or
So of these bolls are found perfectly sufficient for an acre of
this thin, light, dry soil.  Some small experiments have been
made in liming, which have succeeded to the utmost expec-
tation.  There are perhaps from 10 to 12,000 acres of land 
in the parish that could be limed, and made fit for sock and 
scythe; and the successful attempts of individuals, it is to be
hoped, will in time encourage the generality to follow the
example.

   Fisheries.-A pretty considerable river, named Ardstinchar,
runs for about 25 miles through the country, and empties it-
self into the sea at the village of Ballantrae; but it is rapid
and shallow, and can only admit of small boats.  At the 
mouth of this river there is a considerable salmon fishery,
which yields a rent of above L. 80 a year.  The salmon are
thought as good as any in Scotland, and sell upon the spot at
1 1/2 d. the lb. and it is but very lately they were more than
1 d.  About 20 years ago there were great shoals of excel-
lent herrings that came upon the coast at the end of harvest
and beginning of winter, since that time they appear only in
