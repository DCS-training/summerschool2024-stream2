miniature are beginning to be used, drawn by an own in the 
shafts.  All the cattle are of an inferior size.  The sheep,
though such beneficial creatures, are much neglected and ill
treated; instead of shearing the fleece, it is pulled off the
very skin; and to undergo this cruel operation, they are
caught with dogs.  A fleece, in general, will not weigh above
3 lbs. Amsterdam, and for the most part is mixed with hair.

   Population.-The ancient state of the population cannot,
with any degree of precision, be ascertained, owing to the 
parish registers being inaccurately kept.  The return to Dr
Webster, in 175, was 1185 souls.  Since the 1766, theregister
of baptisms, marriages, and burials, have been exactly kept.
In that year, the number of souls was 810; and, by an
accurate enumeration made in 1792, there were only 300
males, and 402 females.  This decrease is not owing to more
distempers or tewer births, but to a disposition in the
youth to leave their native country, and follow the sea-
faring life, wherein they generally acquit themselves with
reputation and advantage.  Although there are upwards of
50 farmers, who pay from L. 6 to L. 12 Sterling of yearly
rent, and who have brought up from 5 to 10 children of
both texes, yet there are not four of them who have the
assistance of a son at home of 20 years of age.  From 15 to
that period, the youths go to the sea, and often never return
to settle in he parish.  The females are the chief assistants in
cultivating the farms.  By the register of baptisms and bu-
rials regularly recorded, the former has exceeded the latter
one third.  Marriages are annually not exceeding 4.  The
farms are small and trifling.  Services are required from
the cotters. who, when employed, are always maintained.
The people are sober, regular, and industrious, neat in their
dress, and domestic economy.  The farm houses are mostly
built of stone and clay, and the yard dikes of the same ma-
terials.
