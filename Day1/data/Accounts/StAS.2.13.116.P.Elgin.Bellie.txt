        The numerous perennial springs are, in general, exuberant, beau-

           There are several lochs. or natural collections of water among
       our woods, the resort of wild-duck and other aquatic fewl; and

       with an island in the centre, and fringed with a circuit of stately
       trees, constitutes; one of the most picturesque beauties which adorn
       the delightful-scenery in the vicinity of Gordon Castle.
