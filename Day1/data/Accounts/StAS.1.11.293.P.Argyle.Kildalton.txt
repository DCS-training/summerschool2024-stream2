plentiful throughout all this island.

   Population.-This parish contains above 1600 souls; and
the females are more numerous than the males, a great num-
ber of young men having left the parish, and gone to the Low
Country for employment:  Some have gone to America and
other places; so that the number of inhabitants has diminish-
ed within these 40 years*.  There is no register kept of the
burials.  The following is a lift of the baptisms and marriages
for the last 4 years.

   Wages, Manner of Living, &c.-The wages of men ser-
vants are 5 L.  Sterling, besides some little advantages, such as
