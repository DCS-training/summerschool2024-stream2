   It is at present only necessary to add, in regard to
the succeeding volumes, that it is the author's inten-
tion, to persevere in the same plan, until he has
given a similar account of every parish of the kingdom.
His object is, to lay the foundation of a great,metho-
dical, and complete survey of Scotland, and perhaps
of England, which he hopes will be undertaken, by
the government of the country, at the commencement

terwards taken, every 50 or 100 years, they will fur-

tional improvement, and will point out the proper
system to be pursued, in order to bring political so-
ciety, in these kingdoms, to the highest pitch of hap-
piness and perfection.

ginally printed in French, which was prefixed to the
specimen of the Statistical Survey of Scotland, above
mentioned, as it tends still farther to explain the na-
ture and importance of this inquiry.
