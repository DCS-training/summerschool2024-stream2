well.  All have a kail yard; almost all a small piece of
ground in tillage.  The straw of the crop maintains a cow
in winter, which grazes with the farmers cattle during the
summer, and many of them have also a few sheep kept
upon the farm, or by some person in the neighbourhood,
for a mere trisle.  A good deal of money is gained by knit-
ting stockings, the general employment of the women:
Young children might also be employed to advantage in
that branch; but as there are few inclosures, most of them
are occupied in looking after every small parcel of sheep or
cattle, during 3-4ths of the year.  Hence a labourer's fa-
mily, while in heath, rarely needs assistance.

   Implements of Husbandry.-There are a great many
ploughs, owing to the number of small farms, each of which
must maintain a plough drawn by small steers, or sometimes
by an intermixture of cows and horses.  The larger farms
are plowed by 8 or 10 small oxen; and the number of 
ploughs in all are between 30 and 40.  There are about
the same number of carts, suited to the size of the horses;
but it is not above 30 years since carts began to be used in
the parish.

   Stipend, Poor, Etc.-The value of the living, including
the glebe, is only about L. 54 a-year; part of it is com-
posed of the vicarage-teind, which is paid to the minister
in kind.  The church was rebuilt about 12 years ago, and
the manse was built in 1724.  The Earl of Fife is patron.
The number of poor receiving stated alms is 4, though
there are other who get occasional supplies.  The annual
amount of contributions for the support of the poor, is about
L. 4, 10 s. besides the interest of L. 40.
