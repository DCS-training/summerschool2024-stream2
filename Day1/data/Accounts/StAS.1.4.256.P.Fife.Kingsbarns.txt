     Statistical Account

   The number of weavers is from 20 to 30;  and these are
the people, at certain seasons of the year, who are also em-
ployed in the different fishings.  They have greatly the ad-
vantage over the fishers in the coast towns to the westward,
who, as they are not bred to business, consequently in
stormy weather, not only are they idle, but half starved,
while the people here are occupied at their looms, and can
earn wages sufficient to maintain their families.-The people
in general are industrious, much disposed to humane gene-

them by Almighty God.  The seasaring is preferred to
the military life;  and there is seldom a season but some of
the young men are employed in the Greenland whale-

5 or 6 yoke of these were constantly employed in agricul-

these plough-gates surround the village, and each of them

8 s. 4 d.  The best arable land is set from L. 1, 15 s. to
L. 2, 2 s. the acre, and the inferior from 15 s. to L. 1.
The valued rent of the parish is L. 6353: 6: 8 Scots.

   Stipend, Poor, etc.-The stipend, including L. 5 allowed
