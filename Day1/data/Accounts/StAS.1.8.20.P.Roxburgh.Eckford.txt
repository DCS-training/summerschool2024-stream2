"but made no invation into England; while the Marquis of Dorset, warden of
"the east and middle marches, entered Tiviotdale with a number of English
"forces, burnt all the towns and villages on every side as he marched north-
"ward, and amongst others Ackforth, Grimslay, Sefs for the manor, etc.; and
"upon Good Friday following withdrew back into England with his plunder,
"amongst which were 4000 head of cattle."
Baker's Chronicle, page 259.  Ridpath's Border History, page 515 in the note.

Lord Dacres was next year appointed warden general of the borders of Eng-
land opposite to Scotland.  From the above quotation it would appear, that
Ackforth, now styled Eckford, was at that period a place of some consequence;
but no other account can be found of its original state.
