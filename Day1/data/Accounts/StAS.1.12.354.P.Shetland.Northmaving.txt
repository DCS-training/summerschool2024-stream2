the tenant engages to fit out, at his own expense, a certain share
of a boat to the ling fishing, which is proportioned to the va-
lue or number of merks of land.  Also, to sell his fish at a 
certain stipulated or understood price to the landlord, and to

   Agriculture.-The soil, from our northern and insular situ-
ation, rather unfavourable for vegetation, must be consider-
ably barren.  The best crop of black oats and bear being the
only grain which the soil of will nourish, is never sufficient
for the inhabitants 9 months in the year; and often when
the seasons are unfavorable, not sufficient to maintain them
4 months, though their allowance of bread is by far less than
in any other part of Great Britain.  Their fishing is the prin-
cipal, if not the only resource, to enable them to provide the
necessaries of life, which renders their supply very precarious.
To the particular account of the state of agriculture in the
neighbouring parish of Delting, very little needs be added,
being the same as here.  About the year 1750, potatoes be-
gan to be planted, and have proved of great advantage to the
inhabitants, being an early food in harvest, when bread is al-
most not to be had, and very comfortable with their small
fish, of which, then, they have usually plenty.  That great
improvements might be made in their mode of farming, is not
to be doubted; but it may be a question if the country is ca-
pable of yielding an increase sufficient for their support.
   It seems better adapted for pasture, and carrying on the
fishing.  The predilection and spirit of the people for the lat-
er, has rendered them quite careless as to the former.  Could
