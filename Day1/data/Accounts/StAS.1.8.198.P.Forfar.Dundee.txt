from the town.  The buyer takes them up and carries them
off the grounds, and none are fed off in the field.  The pota-
toes are chiefly planted by Dundee manufacturers, who also
clean them with hand hoes, and take them up, The farmer
puts the ground in proper order for receiving them, and
draws from 4 L. to 6 L. the acre.  This practice is attended
with the best effects, to the health and more easy subsistence
of the manufacturer and his family; and to the farmer in

nerally raised about 3 feet above the ground, on wooden
frames supported by stone pillars.  Farmers have been, for a
long time, the only instruments employed in winnowing.

hedges and stone fences, but, except in some parts distant from
the town, the inclosures are seldom used for pasture.  The
cattle of all kinds are good, but the parish is not remarkable
for any peculiar breed.  The farmers breed some horses, but
