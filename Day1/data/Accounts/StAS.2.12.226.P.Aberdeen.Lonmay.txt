   The people are in general creditably attentive to their religious
and moral duties; they are well informed considering their op-

consequently, reduce the use of these, to the great detriment of tem-
perance and health; whilst the more intoxicating distilled spirit is
sold at a cheap rate, tempting farm-servants aiid others to dram-
drinking, and affording facilities to all who are so inclined to even-
ing meetings for gossip and tippling, and thence to thriftless and
improper habits.
