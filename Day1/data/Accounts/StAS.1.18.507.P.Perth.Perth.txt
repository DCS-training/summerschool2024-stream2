granted very late in that reign; because Henry Bald, and
Andrew the Son of Simon, who were living before the year
1199, were still alive.  But Henry Bald, who had become a
Goldsmith, or Banker as the term anciently implied, seems
to have been old, and preparing for death, by giving two of
his shops in his tenement in Perth, as alms to the Monastery.
   Every one who compares these two charters, may see that
no alteration of the town had taken place, in the interval be-
twixt the year 1199, and probably the middle of the reign of
Alexander II.
   3. The original charter which King William granted to the
town of Perth, dated at Stirling, on the Lord's day, October

to have been in the year 1210, is still extant.
   A translation has been circulated among some of the Bur-
gesses.  It does not make the smallest mention of any change
of the name, or of the situation of the town, which it cer-

The King confirms the privileges which the burgh enjoyed in
the time of his grandfather King Davids who died in 1153,
and adds some new privileges.

which Fordun says, was to meet shortly after Michaelmars in
1210.  The public writs were dated, as if granted on the
day of the commencement of the Parliament.  The King,
that he might be enabled to fulfil his treaty with King John
of England, craved, and obtained a subsidy of 6000 merks
of which very large sum in those days the Barons agreed to
pay 10,000 and the Burrows 6000.  On that occasion the
Burrow of Perth seems to have been rewarded with a very
clear and particular charter of privileges.
