     Statistical Account

   Minerals.-Here are two valuable quarries, the one of
freestone, the other of grey slate, both of which are deem-
ed inexhaustible.  The access to both is easy, and the ma-
terials are much esteemed in building, for their easiness in
working and durability.

   Cattle.-The native breed of cattle is small; an ordina-
ry ox or cow seldom outweighing 70 or 80 lbs. a-quarter.
The horses are very indifferent, except with the best far-
mers.  Sheep are numerous, small sized, and mostly white;
their wool is fine, and the mutton very delicate.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report in 1755,
the population of Rafford then amounted to 1313 souls.
From an accurate list taken in 1791, the number of
parishioners did not exceed 1072; of these 488 were
males, and 584 females; about 840 were found ex-
aminable, i. e. above 7 years old.  The number of house-
holders was exactly 238; of whom 136 were married, and
had issue; 16 were married, and had no issue; 18 were
widowers; 48 widows; the remaining 20 unmarried, and
5 of them bachelors.  The annual medium of births for
the last 7 years, as they stand on the record, may be com-
puted at 32; of marriages, at 8: But of the deaths no ex-
act register has been kept, owing chiefly to that reluctance
with which the tax on burials was paid by country peo-
ple*.

   Poor.-About 40 poor are supplied from the parish
funds.  Our capital stock is L. 50 Sterling, and our week-
ly collections amount from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The late taxes on births, baptisms, marriages, burials, etc. are now
repealed.
