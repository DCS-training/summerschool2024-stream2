the same time, a very high price.  By the beginning of
August, the general distress was greatly relieved.  In 1756,
or 1757, corn and meal were nearly as dear as in 1783;
but the price of yarn one third lower; and the poor, by
consequence, suffered more in that season, than in 1783.
   It might have been mentioned before, that as the pre-
valent language of the parish is Gaelic, the proper names
of places are all of Gaelic derivation.  Logierait, for in-
stance, is compounded of the two Gaelic words, Logan, a
hollow place; and Reite, the ending of differences; and the place
seems to have received the name from its low situation,
and from its having been the seat of the regality court of
Atholl.  The farm next adjoining to that, properly called
Logierait, has received the name of Ballintoin, or Marsh-
town, from it situation, and the nature of the ground in it.
Another, Ballinearn, or Allertown, because surrounded with
brush-wood of this sort.  Another farm, which one belong-
ed to the old Abbacy of Cupar, bears, in the same man-
ner, a Gaelic name, expressive of that circumstance.

   Improvements suggested.-It would tend much to the ad-
vantage and cultivation of this country, if the services perform-
ed by the tenants were converted into money.  At present
they perform many carriages to a distance; make the peats
and carry them home:  In part they till the ground of the pro-
prietor in spring, and cut down his corn in harvest.  The esta-
blisbment of manufactures; the enlargement of the farms,
so as to enable every farmer to keep a plough for himself;
the inclosure of the fields; the division of the commons; the
straightening of the ridges in plowing; the giving up the
prevalent practice of run-ridges; and the spreading of plan-
tations of larches and Scotch firs over the wild and barren
hills, would, no doubt, contribute greatly to improve the
condition, and increase the population of this parish.
