     Statistical Account

   It is to be remarked, that many of the boys who come as
apprentices from different parts of the country, leave the
town as soon as they have learned their trade.
   Also many other young men, whose parents are residing in
the town, go to seek their fortune elsewhere in the kingdom,
or in foreign parts.  The females in general remain, and there
are always more unmarried women than batchelors.

   For the reason mentioned in the last remark I made upon
the marriages, I do not think that any accurate calculation of
the number of inhabitants can be made in multiplying the
number of baptisms by 27.
