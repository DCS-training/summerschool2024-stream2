died in 1705. At the Revolution of 1688, the number of Presby-
terian ministers in this part of Scotland was so small, that the old
Presbyteries of Brechin, Fordun, and Arbroath, were obliged for
some time to associate in one Presbytery; and it was not till 1704
that the Presbytery of Arbroath was again disjoined, and erected
into a separate Presbytery by the Synod of Angus and Mearns.

		         III.--POPULATION.
	Though the introduction nf spinning-mills, and the more exten-
sive cultivation of the moor lands, have tended to the increase
of the population, it is probable that the inhabitants are not more
numerous at present than they were in ancient times. Several
farms have wholly disappeared, which once had each of them a
resident population of tenants and cottagers. The very names of
other farms are now generally forgotten; and in some cases, where
writings have presererved the names, the sites can no longer be dis-
covered. Of such farms as still exist, several are here and there
united under one tenant. The high state of cultivation to which
the land has been brought, renders fewer labourers necessary than
before; and the demand for manual labour is still farther dimi-
nisbed by the machinery and improved implements which the mo-
dern husbandry has called to her aid.
	During 6 years, from 1657 to 1662, both inclusive, the yearly
average of deaths was 17. During 44 years, from 1657 t6 1700,
both inclusive, the yearly average of marriages, where either both
parties or the bride belonged to the parish, was 6 1/7. During forty-
two years from 1657 to 1698, both inclusive, the yearly average of
baptisms was 22 1/91. For the seven years immediately preceding 1838,
the, yearly average of births was 23 4/7; of deaths, 10; and of mar-
riages where either both parther or the bride belonged to the pa-
rish, 6 6/7. The deaths of 1837, though only equalling the births,
