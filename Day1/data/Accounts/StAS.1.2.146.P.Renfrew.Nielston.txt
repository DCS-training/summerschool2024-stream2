     Statistical Account

Lochlibo, covering 16 acres of land, abounding with pike and
perch, surrounded with extensive thriving plantations of pines,
and almost every king of forest trees; the property of Wil-
liam Mure, Esq. of Caldwell, whole mansion-house and plea-
sure grounds in the parish of Beith, are in the neighbour-
hood.  From Lochlibo, issues, with an almost impercepti-
ble motion, the water of Lugton, meandering through a
large meadow of near 100 acres, and running westward
through Ayr-shire.  At its source, it is a small rivulet, but be-
fore it reaches the plantations and pleasure-grounds of Eglin-
ton, it increases into a considerable and rapid current.  It is
faid, that, at a considerable expence, the waters of this loch
might be brought eastward through Nielston to join the La-
vern, about two miles distance.-There are several other ri-
vulets in this parish, which, from the vicinitude to the large
manufacturing towns of Glasgow and Paisley, (the former be-
ing only nine miles distant), have become of great value to the
proprietors; all of them having their banks occupied with
extensive bleachfields, which, in consequence of the excellent
spring in their neighbourhood, (the purity of whole water is
very great,) and the plenty of coals in this, and the adjoining
parish of Paisley, carry on a most extensive business in bleach-
ing, but chiefly of light goods, as muflins, cambricks, lawns,
etc.

   Woods and Plantations.-There are no natural woods of
consequence in this, nor in the three adjacent parishes on the
south and west, a want severe'y felt by the inhabitants.  There
are, however, besides the plantations round Lochlibo, just
now mentioned, and some on the heights of Lochlibo-side*, a
