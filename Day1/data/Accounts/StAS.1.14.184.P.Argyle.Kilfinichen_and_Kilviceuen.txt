are small, nor are the ranges very regular.  Seams of
coals appear in some places.  Taking the whole to-
gether, the appearance is very picturesque, particularly
in times of storms and of rain, when the sea rages be-
low, and numberless cascades fall precipitately down the
precipices and broken rocks above.  Some travellers

are the effects of volcanoes, or some violent concussion of
the earth.

   Rocks and Stones.-There are rocks and stones of va-

stone, lime-stone, moor-stone or whin-stone, flags and 
pebbles.  A marble quarry was opened some years ago,
under the patronage of the Duke of Argyll, in the
island of I, which is Grace's property.  A consi-
derable quantity of marble was quarried, and sent to
Leith and London; but, after much money was laid out,
the quarry was given up, for some time at least.  The
marble is said to be of excellent quality.  The whole
coast of Ross, upon the sound of I, is granite for several
miles.  No use is made of it, except in building farm-
houses and walls.  There is lime-stone in Carsaig and
Gribun; but both these coasts are so dangerous for ship-
ping, that no use is made of it.  Free-stone is also found 
in Carsaig of excellent quality.  Some of it is used by 
several gentlemen in the country for their houses.  A 
great proportion of the rocks of Ross consists of flags, that
might serve to excellent purpose for arching of bridges.
The only use they are put to in the country is lintels
for doors and windows, and building farm-houses and
