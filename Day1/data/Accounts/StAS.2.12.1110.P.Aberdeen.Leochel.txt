1646, and sheriff of Aberdeen in 1647. He is frequently men-
tioned by Spalding, who styles him "a great Covenanter," and
"a prime man"-and represents him as "a rick-master" and
commander of a troop of horse. He was succeeded by his son Sir
John; Sir John by his son Sir William; Sir William by his son Sir
Arthur, who represented his native county in Parliament, and was
the bosom friend of Sir Andrew Mitchell, well known as British
Ambassador to Frederick the Great of Prussia, who left to Sir
Arthur the bulk of his property, including his valuable library and
his estate of Thainston; Sir Arthur was succeeded by his son Sir
William, Sir William by his son Sir Arthur, and Sir Arthur by
his brother Sir John, the seventh baronet and present proprie-
tor.*
    Easter Fowlis or Fowlis Mowat.-This small property belong-
ed in the fourteenth century to the Earls of Mar, and was given
in 1377, by William Earl of Douglas and Mar, to James Mowat.
The Mowats appear to have held it for about a century; and
there is to be seen, in a hollow on the hill of Shiel, a curious me-
morial of the last Mowat of Fowlis. This is a little mound, over-
grown with grass, called Mowat's Seat, and a field near is named
from it the "Mowat Seat" park. The name is accounted for by
the tradition, that when the funeral procession of this last Mowat
of Fowlis, whose usual imprecation had been, that "he might be
buried beyond sight of kirk or mill," had reached this sequestered
spot, the corpse suddenly became preternaturally heavy, and the
bearers were obliged to inter it there, whence accordingly no
view can be obtained of either of these objects of his animosity. In
1479, Robert Lumysden of Madler, had a charter from the Earl of
Rothes, superior, of the Halflands of Fowlis-Mowat, in the ba-
rony of Cusny; in 1628, Robert Lumisdane, fiar of Cushny, with
consent of his father, John Lumisdane, sold these lands to Andrew
Birnie, merchant-burgess of Aberdeen; in 1635, Andrew Birnie
sold them for 14,000 merks Scots to "Capitan James Forbes,"
son of umquhile Robert Forbes, commendator Of Monymusk, whose
only daughter and heiress, Margaret Forbes, with consent of her
husband, Peter Forbes, second son of Sir John Forbes of Craigie-
var, sold them to Sir John in 1696; and since that time they have
remained united to the Craigievar estate.+
    Wegter Fowlis.-This property, including Easter-Leochel and
Craigmill, belonged about the middle of the sixteenth century to
