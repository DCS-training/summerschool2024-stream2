     Statistical Account

The number of poor who are upon the pension list, and re-
ceive weekly alms from the Session, is 80, besides others who
receive occasional supplies.  The contribution, at the church
and chapel, annually averages at L. 100; which, together
with the interest of L. 100, and some occasional donations,
is all that is distributed among the poor.  From these funds,
they can only receive from 6 d. to 1 s. each, per week; which,
although it may assist them a little, is by no means able to sup-
port them in their own houses, even when joined to the profits
of any little labour which some of them may have strength to
perform.  Begging, therefore, is allowed, and is very great
burden upon the inhabitants.  The poor, indeed, will never
be suitably or permanently provided for, until the proprietors
of land agree to assess themselves in a sum that may be ade-
quate to this purpose:  and when it is considered, that the
greater part of the heritors are non-residing, that they con-
tribute nothing to the maintenance of the poor by their own
personal charity, and that the value of their property is great-
ly increased by the manufacturers and population of the place;
such a measure, must appear, to every humane and benevo-
lent heart, to be highly equitable and proper; and, it is hoped,
will be soon carried into effect.

   Coal.-There is an extensive and profitable coal work in the
parish, about half a mile to the south west of the town.  The
mines are rich and abundant, affording coal of different qua-
lities, some fit for export, and some for home consumption.
The species that is raised for exportation, is known in this
country by the name of Blind-coal.  It is of a fine quality, and
much esteemed.  The quantity of this species annually expor-
ted, is 3289 1/16 tons, which, at 9 s per ton, is L. 1390 :1 :6 3/4.
This immense quantity is carried by land to Irvine, about
six miles distance, and from hence exported to different places
