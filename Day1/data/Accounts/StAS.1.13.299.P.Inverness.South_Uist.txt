   Rent of the Parish.-The land-rent is supposed to be a-
bout L. 2200 Sterling.  It has risen about one half with-
in these 6 years back; by the accounts given of the land-
rent of the parish, the factors say, that the whole is laid
out in paying the kelp manufacturers.  One heritor resides
now in the parish.

   Antiquities.-The only thing remarkable in this way to
be observed in the parish, are the remains of the Danish
forts, which are built in a circular form of large whin
stones, without any kind of cement; these towers, or forts,
are to be seen in all the Hebrides.  In the island of Ben-
becula, a district of the parish, called, in Gaelic, Belan-
Vealla, the remains of one of these towers, of a very large
size, are to be seen; the name is Dun Elvine nean Ruarie,
or the tower of Elvina, tha daughter of Rory; this Elvina
being the daughter of some Danish chieftain, as traditionary
account tells.  There are also the remains of Druidical tem-
ples still visible in many parts of the parish.  Although
by tradition, it is said, that this island, in old times, abound-
ed with wood, yet the smallest stump of a tree cannot now
be seen in it; indeed, attempts were made lately to plant
wood of different kinds, but there is the greatest probabili-
ty against its coming to any perfection.
