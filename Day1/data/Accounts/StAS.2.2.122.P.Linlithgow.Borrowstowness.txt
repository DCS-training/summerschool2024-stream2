on its banks, but three only are in operation at present in the pa-
rish, and belong to the Duke of Hamilton. Two of these are
grain-mills; the third was erected for grinding malt for the brewers
in Bo'ness, but is employed at present for grinding flint for the
pottery.
   The Dean or Den Burn, and the Gil Burn, two streamlets
running in ravines near Kinneil House, add to the beauty of the
scenery, but are too small for any mechanical advantage.
   The number of coal-pits sunk in the neighbourhood has ren-
dered the supply of water in the town scanty; but there are se-
veral good springs in the landward part of the parish. One of
these, at a small distance from the town, affords a copious supply
of excellent water, part of which is conveyed to the town in pipes. *
   Geology and Mineralogy.-The strata in this parish are all of
the coal formation. They lie with considerable regularity, and
in general dip to the west, at the rate of from one in six, to one
in ten. There is no appearance of trap dikes passing through the
seams of coal, except at the south-east corner of the parish, where
Irongath Hill, or Glour o'er'em, appears protruded through them.
There is a great quantity of apparently trap rock lying in beds in
the strata; and though there is a considerable number of dikes or
slips in the strata, almost all running nearly east and west, these
slips seldom alter the quality of the coal.
   A general section of the strata at the Snab, a site lately
spoken of as the best for a new winning of the coal-field (the pre-
sent being considerably exhausted), may be stated as follows:-

ticed, although it has given the name Well o' Spa to a locality near the west end of
Bo'ness.
