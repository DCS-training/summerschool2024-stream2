"out-skirts of a property or farm, pay by mutual agreement to the pro-
"prietor or tacksman in lieu of money or victual rent, or in part of the
"rent.  The services performed by such as pay no other rent are always
"personal, and commonly not limited to a certain number of days, though
"restricted to certain seasons of the year, and to particular kinds of work,
"viz. shearing in harvest; carrying the corn from the stacks to the barns in
"the winter; delving or turning with a spade such corners or angles of a
"field as the plough cannot reach, in spring; planting potatoes, cutting or
"spreading peats, and weeding in the fields and gardens, in summer.  As
"these services, however, and the culture of their own small possessions,
"take up but little of their time, and as the produce of such possessions,
"commonly does not serve to maintain the possessors, they subsist chiefly,
"the men, by being employed as day-labourers by their master or the
"neighbouring farmers; the women, by spinning lint or wool for private
"families, or such as are concerned in manufactures.
"But the services of such as pay either money or victual-rent are com-
"monly limited to a certain number of days; and the work which they
"with their cattle are bound to perform, is specified, such as ploughing or
"carrying manure, cutting and carrying home a limited quantity of peats,
"and shearing or stacking corn and hay.  When these services are perform-
"ed faithfully and cheerfully, and when the master, whether proprietor or
"tacksman, demands no more than an equivalent for what rent the ground
"so possessed is worth, both parties are benefited by the bargain; as the
"master could not always get his work so quickly or so cheaply done by any
"other hands, and as it is easier for most of our small tenants and cottars
"to pay the whole or part of their rent by their personal labour, or that
"of their cattle, than to pay the full value of their possessions in money or
"victual.  I know that this opinion of mutual advantage from services has
"been controverted, and the practice in general condemned as oppressive
"by our southern neighbours; nor will I deny, that where such manufactures
"are established as are fit to employ persons of both sexes and all ages;
"and that, in the neighbourhood of towns or populous manufacturing vil-
"lages, where a farmer could get any number of labourers wanted for a par-
"ticular purpose for a few days, the small tenants and cottars might find
"it more for their interest to pay a proportional rent without any services;
"and the proprietor or tacksman might bring his outfields to a better
