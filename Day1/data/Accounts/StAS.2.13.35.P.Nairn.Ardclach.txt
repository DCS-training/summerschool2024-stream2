            Planting.-The planted wood in the parish consists principally
        of Scotch fir and larch; but there is also some little hard-wood.
        The only plantations of any extent, formed within the last thirty
        years, are those on the property of Glenfairness, bv the late
        Sir James Montgomery Cuninghame. They consist chiefly of
        larch, with a sprinkling of common Scotch fir, and some hard
        wood in the low sheltered dells; and are extremely thriving.
        There are several older plantations on the Lethen estate; and particularly,
	a considerable fnrest of fir, called the wood of Dulcie,
        which is almost wholly indigenous. The indigenous trees are
        Scotch pine or fir (Pinus sylvestris); common birch, (Befula alba)
	and weeping birch; alder, (Alnus glutinosa); hazel, (Corylus
	avellana); aspen or trembling poplar, (Populus tremula); bird-
        cherry, (Prunus padus) ; sloe or black-thorn, (Prunus spinosa);
        mountain-ash or roan, (Pyrus aucuparia); holly, (Ilez aquifolium);
	and willow. Alders formerly succeeded well along the
        banks of the river and larger burns, and attained to a great size;
        but, of late years, they are decaying in this as in other parishes,
        though the cause of their ceasing to thrive is unknown
          Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land in the parish
        is about 10s. per acre. In the upper part of the parish grazing
        for a cow on inland and green pasture is 12s., and for a stot on
        hill-ground, 3s. 6d. to 5s. In the lower district of the parish, the
        ground is more valuable, carries larger animals, and puts them into
        better condition, and will bring 4s. or,.5s. additional. The hilly
        ground, in the upper district, and the "streens" is the only ground
        occupied by sheep; and there the charge for a year's keep of one
        sheep is 2s.
