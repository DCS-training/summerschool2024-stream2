     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH of ANWOTH.

     (COUNTY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY,
     PRESBYTERY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.)

     By the Rev. Mr HUGH GORDON.

     Name, Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

   In old records, respecting this parish, dated about 60
years ago, it is spelled Anworth, sometimes Anworth,
and at other times Anworth, but the name Anworth is at
present retained, and its origin, we believe, cannot now be
ascertained.  The parish is about 6 1/2 miles long, from N. E.
to S. W. and 3 1/2 broad.  The sea-shore, which bounds
the parish for about 2 1/2 miles from the mouth of the river
Fleet, to the confines of Kirkmabreck, is generally flat and
rocky, though in one place it is bold and elevated.  It
contains no harbours.  The land which lies upon the sea-
shore, and near the mouth of the river, is in general flat;
the soil is dry and fertile, lying for the most part on a bed
of land or gravel.  This part produces excellent crops of
grain and grass; but the soil being thin, it is much injured
