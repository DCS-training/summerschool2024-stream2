The cattle were sold to butchers, who drove them to the
Edinburgh and Glasgow markets:  the swine were killed
and cured into bacon and pork for England.  The work
people employed were nearly 300.  The distillery and
utensils cost upwards of 40,000 l.  Sterling; and when sold
by the trustee for the creditors of the former proprietor,
yielded about 7000 l. Sterling.
   No situation could have been more eligible for a distil-
lery than Kilbagie; and it was erected in the most sub-
stantial manner.  The buildings occupy a space of above 4
acres of ground; all surrounded by a high wall.  The
barns for malting are of a prodigious size, and are 4 sto-
ries in height.  A small rivulet runs through the middle
of the works, and drives a threshing mill, and all the
grinding mills necessary for the distillery; besides supply-
ing with water a canal, which communicates with the
river Forth, of about a mile in length, cut for the pur-
pose of conveying both the imports and exports of the dis-
tillery.
   The distillery at Kennetpans, which is advantageously
situated on the very banks of the river Forth, was in pro-
portion to that of kilbagie, as three to five.  And before
these two distilleries were stopped, they paid to govern-
ment an excite duty considerably greater than the whole
land tax of Scotland.  At present, the duty paid by both
is about 8000 l. Sterling yearly.  There is an engine, of
Bolton and Watt's construction, at the distillery of Ken-
netpans; being the first of the kind that was erected in
Scotland.
