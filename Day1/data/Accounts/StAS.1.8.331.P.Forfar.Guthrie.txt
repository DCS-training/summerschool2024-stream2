   Agriculture and Cattle, etc.-There is a regular rotation of
crops, in the southern, as well as in the northern part of the
parish, and probably about the same proportion of oats, bar-
ley, pease, etc.; but it is divided into such small parts, that it
was impossible to state them accurately.  There are six farms
in the southern part, viz. one of 169 acres; one of 65; one
of 45; one of 47; one of 39; and one of 33 acres, all arable:
and the rest of the estate of Kirkbuddo is divided into no
less than 25 small farms.  The number of cattle and horses
are in proportion to the grass, and the lands in cultivation.
There are not above 3 or 4 saddle horses, and scarcely any
sheep or hogs.

   Rent and Proprietors.-The average price of land, lately let
in the northern part, is about 15 s. and in the southern part,
10 s the acre.  The valued rent of the parish is 1500 L. Scotch,
and the real rent above 1000 L. Sterling.  The parish is di-
vided among 3 proprietors, only one of whom, (Guthrie of
that ilk,) resides in it about 7 months of the year.

   Church, School and Poor.-The kirk and school are situ-
ated in the northern part of the parish.  The manse is old
and ruinous.  The stipend, including 2 chalders of meal, at
the ordinary conversion, is below 50 L. Sterling.  The glebe
is a legal one.  The church is an elegant building for such a
country parish.  The walls, or at least a part of them, are
said to be about 300 years old, and they may stand for 1000
