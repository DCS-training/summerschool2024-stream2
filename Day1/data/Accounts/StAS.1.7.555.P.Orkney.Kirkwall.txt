fer an obligation on Kirkwall, on account of favours received
or expected, gifted the right of patronage, so far as it was in
him, to the magistrates, town-council, and community; since
which time the town has claimed and exercised the right of
presenting the clergymen of Kirkwall.
   The heritors in the country parish are 14 in number, and
only 4 of them are not resident.  The poor are not depend-
ent upon them; for, though there be commonly 50 or 60
of them upon the roll, besides others who, through sickness
or misfortune, apply sometimes for charity, they are support-
ed by the kirk-session out of funds furnished by the ordinary
collections at the church-door, and occasional donations,
which, at an average, seldom exceed 25 L. Sterling.  To
whatever cause the number of the poor may be ascribed,
it surely cannot be the dearth of provisions; for here they
are undoubtedly as low as they are in any other district in
the kingdom.  In proof of this, we may observe, that beef
never sells at above 2 d. and seldom at more than 1 1/2 d. per
pound.  Mutton, lamb, and pork, are much about the same
price.  A goose, fit for the spit, is purchased for 1 s.; ducks
for as much the pair; hens at 4 d. each; and chickens at
2 d.  The Amsterdam pound of cheese is worth 2 1/2 d. while
the same pound of butter is worth 6 d.  In years of ordinary
plenty, the oats, which are of a small black coarse kind, sell
at about 5 s. 6 d. the Linlithgow boll; and, while that is the
case, the bear, which is also very small, brings about 7 s.
Sterling.  The labourers in husbandry not only here, but
through the other islands, receive, per day, 8 d. of wages;
and tradesmen, particularly wrights and masons, when they
do not work for so much the piece, in the common mode,
they can earn every day 16 d. or 18 d.
