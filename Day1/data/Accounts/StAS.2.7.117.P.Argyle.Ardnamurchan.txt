                     PARISH Of ARDNAMUCHAN. *

               PRESBYTERY OF MULL, SYNOD OF ARGYLE.

               THE REV. ARCHIBALD CLERK, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Names.-BEFORE the Reformation, three parishes were com-
prised in the portion of country now known as the parish of Ard-.
namurchan.  At the establishment of the Protestant Church,
these appear to have fallen under the care of one minister; but
the united parishes, according to a practice not unfrequent, re-
ceived as a common name, not that of all or any of the three pa-
rishes, but that of the chief of five districts within its bounds.
This was Ardnamurchan, naturally the most fertile, and conse-
quently, before the resources of the less arable, though now per-
haps not less valuable districts, were discovered, by far the most
populous,--a precedence which it still holds to a considerable ex-
tent.  Some consequence farther accrued to it from the castle and
residence of the ancient Lords of Ardnamurchan and Sunart be-
ing situated at its western extremity, as are also, since the Re-
formation, the parish church and dwelling of the minister.
   The ancient and perhaps poetical name of Ardnamurchan was
" Riochd na Sorcha," (the kingdom of Sorcha,) an. appellation for
certain districts not singular in the Highlands, and which would
claim for it in remote antiquity certainly not less extent than in
modern times it possesses as a parish.  Its present name is un-
derstood to signify the " Promontory or heights of the great seas,"
(Aird nam Mur Chuan,) though some may fancy it to, be
" Aird nam Mur Chumhan," the " promontory of the narrow seas."
Certainly both are strictly significant of its character and
for to the westward it throws a bold and striking headland of ste-
rile rock far into the sea, so as to form a remarkable, boundary be.
