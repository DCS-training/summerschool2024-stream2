     of Nigg.

Dee is a clear rapid river, flowing mostly through gravelly
soil, favourable to natural wood, and sometimes riles to over-
flow the haughs, carry off part of the mould, and sweep a-
way corns.  The upper haugh in this parish is a little ex-
posed, and in autumn 1768 suffered.  One lake, the Loch
of Lorstown, is on the south-west boundary, oblong in form,
covering 27 acres, and supplying water to the only mill here.
There is also one chalybeat spring, though not frequented
for any diseases; but springs of fine water abound.

   Face of the Country, etc.-Being destitute of wood, the
face of the country is naked.  In the last age, a grove seems
to have been by the harbour mouth to the edge of the water.
And besides many remains of oak dug out of the moss,
stumps of trees, which must have been one and a half, and
two feet diameter, still stand on the east side of it, above
ground.  Fine grass, mingled with many herbs, grows early
on the sea banks, and rock top, almost ever green from the
spray and dews.  Through the large uncultivated, and, for
the most part, uncultivable space of this parish, a low heath
is spread.  The sea-side and hill pasture is reckoned good
and wholesome for sheep, and almost never is covered to any
depth with snow.  The corn fields are liable to the common
weeds, especially to skelloch, (mostly wild mustard), for
which, to sow late after ploughing, when the plant is risen
up, and may be destroyed by harrowing, has been tried with
success.
   Many stones of the granite kind lie on the surface, which,
with those taken from the rock by the sea, and under grounds
are some of a beautiful bluish, and others of a purple and va-
rious heu.  They supply abundant materials for building and
inclosing.  Several species here, from the attraction of the
magnet, seem to be volcanic; so are others in the hills far
