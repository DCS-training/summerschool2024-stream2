     of Rathven.

   The following state of the loss sustained by the fisher-
towns in this parish, will show this matter in a stronger
light.

<TABLE>

1.  In Buckie, since 1723, 8 boats, with
    their crews and passengers, have pe-
    rished, amounting in all to               60 men and boys.
Of that number, 50 have been lost within   
    these 40 years; and it is well attested   
    that so many have not died a natural
    death in the same period.
2.  Porteasy has lost since it became a
    fishing station,                           7 men.
3.  Findochtie, about 38 years ago, lost
    1 boat, and                     
4.  Portknockie, within these 26 years,
    has lost 5 boats and their crews, with   
    a yawl and 6 boys, in all,                41 men and boys.
                                             ---
                                    total,   112 men and boys.
                                      And     14 boats, 1 yawl*.

   State of the Church.-As the heritors have entered into
a contract with an undertaker to build a new church, on
an approved plan, to contain 1000 persons, it is not ne-
cessary to say much respecting the present one.  It may,
however, be mentioned, that part of it, according to the

*The above contains a powerful claim on the feelings of humanity,
and on the aid of Government for the protection and preservation of hu-
man lives.  In the estimation of those who are best acquainted with the
Moray frith, and most skilful in naval affairs, a harbour at Findochtie
would save the lives of mariners, and prove extremely beneficial to the
country.  In its present state, it is of easy access, and the boats when
overtaken by a north westerly storm, generally direct their course to it,
as to a place of safety.
