well as below that, for the floors of the first and second
stories.  Ten or 12 yards without the walls, the ditch begins,
which surrounded the castle from 30 to 40 feet broad, and
was filled with water from the river.  The whole building,
including the towers, covers about 1600 yards; and, within
the outside of the ditch, are 7000 square yards, which is
nearly an acre and a half of English measure.
   At the hand gate, between the south and east towers,
there are some remains of a building for the draw-bridge.
The gate is 9 feet wide, and arched to the same height,
with abutments of 14 feet at each side, to strengthen it
within.  There was also another gate, directly opposite to
this one, of nearly the same size, which probably might an-
swer as a water gate, and lead into the river.  Besides these
two principal entries, three of the towers were provided with
sally ports, one from each tower, well contrived, and close
to the arrow-holes, which also flanked and defended them.
To the lowest story of each tower, there is a door, leading
in from the inner area of the castle, and a winding stair up
to the second story through the heart of the wall.  From
the second story there is also a door on each side of every
tower, leading up to the top of the rampart, a curtain wall
between the towers.  This wall had a parapet of stone.  2
feet thick, outside and inside, between which the troops
might stand in security, and defend themselves with missle
weapons from the top of it.  The whole was evidently de-
fended by arrows.  Every tower is built with loop holes on
each side of it, so contrived as to flank the whole curtain of
the rampart as far as the next tower.  These arrow holes,
or perpendicular slits in the walls, are well contrived to al-
low the archers a free aim, and defend them at the same
time from any weapons without.  The western tower, which
is always called the Cumming's tower, is 42 feet diameter over
