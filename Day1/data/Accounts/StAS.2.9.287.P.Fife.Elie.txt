people which, it may be doubted, whether it ever was for edifica-
tion. The spirit at least of our days would not bear it; and com-
paring the state of morality then, with that which exists now, we
do not seem to be far behind what is commonly considered the
high and palmy days of the church.
   Antiquities.--There are no antiquities in the parish, nor yet any
modern buildings worthy of notice. Elie House might easily be
rendered an elegant mansion, and the grounds about it seem to
have been laid out with considerable taste. But as the proprie-
tor never resides there, and as there are no funds to keep them in
proper order, both are fast going to decay.

                of deaths, according to an account kept by the grave-digger,  16
            By which number,if we should divide the gross amount of the
            population, it will give the length of a generation sixty-five
            years. This speaks much for the healthiness of the place.
Number of unmarried men (bachelors) above 45,               -         -        4
       of unmarried women above,             -          -             -       45

About fifty years ago, when the population was only 620, the average
      number of births was,          -       -         -              -    22 4/7
              of deaths,          -        -          -         -          17 3/7

Much about the same that it is now when there is an increase of about 400 in the
   population. I cannot attempt to say how this fact is to be explained.
   Within the last three years there has been one illegitimate birth.
For two years and upwards there have been none.
   Character and Manners of the people.--The inhabitants are in
general industrious and sober, regular in their observance of the
ordinances of religion, and there are few places where the Sabbath
is more becomingly and devoutly observed. It is no doubt true,
that here, as in other parts of the country, some are neither so
strict in their attendance in public worship, nor so correct in their
habits as might be wished; and what appears strange is, that the
exceptions to the prevailing decorum are chiefly to be found among
the female part of the population. The number, however, is
small ; and while the old are dying out, we are not aware that any
of the young are addicting themselves to the same disorderly prac-
tices. It has often been remarked by strangers that on Sundays
