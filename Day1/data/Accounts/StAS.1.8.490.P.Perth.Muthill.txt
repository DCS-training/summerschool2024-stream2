The late rapid increase has been partly owing to the division
and subdivision of farms, (which was frequently the case,
while the Perth estate was in the hands of the commissioners);
and partly to the enlargement of the village of Muthil.

   Village.-In 1770, Muthil contained only about 50 or 60
families; but since that period, so many new feus have been
given off and built, and so many small old houses have been
taken down and rebuilt, upon a larger scale, that it now con-
sists of about 140 houses and rooms, that contain separate fa-
milies; so that the number of fouls, on a moderate calcula-
tion, is upwards of 400; whereas formerly, the whole num-
ber did not exceed 200, at the utmost.

   Professions.-There are about 50 mechanics of different
kinds in this village; 6 shopkeepers, and 7 or 8 public houses;
the rest chiefly consist of day labourers, and their families;
widows, who have resorted hither for the education of their
children; and old unmarried women, who have retired from
service.  There is no writer, surgeon, or physician in the pa-
rish.  When legal or medical assistance is needed, application
is made to those at Crief or Dumblane.

   Rent and Heritors.-The valued rent of the parish is
7784 L. 10 s. Scotch; the real rent is upwards of 4000 L. Ster-
