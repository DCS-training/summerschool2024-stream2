   The balance should be on the debit side, and will shew the
profit on the farm.  Board wages being allowed the work
people, every return should be computed.  Only natural hay
is not counted, because the cattle use it, and no allowance
is made for their keeping.  In valuing the oats, regard should
be had to what they are worth, standing; and the white fod-
der indemnifies future trouble.
   The other method of computation proceeds upon what is
stated page 447, viz. that the farmers depend upon their
young cattle and their barley, together with most of their
fown hay, and whatever oats or oatmeal they can spare, to
make up their rents, and pay expence of management.  This
method allows a charge upon all money advanced, but gives
no allowance for board, nor for keeping of horses or cattle.
It admits all kinds of family expences, in so far as the family
assist in the management of the farm, and gives the per centage,
not only on stock and utensils, but upon household furni-
ture; including an allowance to the farmer, as double wages,
but no board; incidental labour, and charges for lime being
also computed.  If there be any turnips sold, or any pota-
toes, or swine, these go to the other side with the returns of
the cattle, wool, and crop.
   The result in this method may serve to check and prove
the other method.  As they are both founded in the minute
