shells, both of which, though shallow, are very fertile. In
the higher grounds there is some light soil, but the greatest
part of it is a deep stubborn clay, that neither agrees with a
wet nor a dry season, but yields considerable crops in favour-
able weather.  About the town the ground is flat, but it
rises gently from the coast.  From the vicinity of the sea,
and from the easterly fogs, which come from the German
ocean, the air is moist; yet the parish cannot be said to be
unhealthy.  Agues, which from the above mentioned cir-
cumstances might be supposed to be prevalent, are totally
unknown; and no epidemical diseases, except the small-pox,
have appeared within these last twenty years.  The practice
of inoculation is increasing, and has been attended with
success.

   Rivers, Fisheries, and Produce of the Coast, etc.-A small
river divides the two Anstruthers, in which, it is said, there
was once a considerable salmon fithery, whence the arms of
the town, bearing three salmon is said to be derived.  Cod,
ling, turbot, hollybut, skate, haddocks, herrings, flounders,

Stirling, and Glasgow.  Lobsters are the only fish sent to
London, for which, it is supposed, that above L. 1000 is an-
nually brought into this and the neighbouring towns.  Great
quantities of sea weeds are thrown on shore after storms, and
are used as manure.  Once in two years, the sea weeds, grow-
ing on the rocks, are cut and burnt into kelp; ten ton of
which is thought a good produce for the two years.  The
first mention of kelp in the records is in the year 1694,
when an Englishman offered the town-council L. 4 for the
privilege of cutting and burning it for one year, which one
of the bailies protected against, as being prejudicial to the
health of the inhabitants, and his own family; but at length
