   Glasgow beint the great mart in this country, servants wa-
ges, the price of labour, and the value of provisions, etc. etc.
are regulated, throughout the country by the rates there.  From
the nature of circumstances, many things are a little lower
here; but people being always eager to resort to the best mar-

at Glasgow.
   The two principal roads, through this parish, were made and
are upheld by turnpikes.  They are generally kept in pretty
good order; though, from the softness of the soil, and the
scarcity of materials, hard enough to stand the fatigue of the ma-

of the advantage of turnpike roads, since, at least, three times
as much weight can be drawn in a carriage, as was sufficient
to load it before they were made.  If any objection can be
made to the turnpike roads of this country, it is to the manner
in which they have been laid out, being generally conducted
over the summit of every eminence in their course; when
with a little judgement and attention, a direction might have
been found equally near, and incomparably more easy and con-
venient.
   The cross roads in this parish being numerous, and the soil

them directed to work, under a proper overseer, upon the
road, in which they had most interest, the people are be-
come so sensible of the advantage of good roads, that they
