present, almost the whole of it is consumed in the manufac-
tures of the district.  And to supply these, about as much
more is spun by manufacturers of this place in a neighbouring
parish*, where the convenience of water has induced them
to erect machinery.

   Ship-building-Ship building was introduced here in 1778.
Previous to that time, a great proportion of the ships employ-
ed in the trade of Great Britain, was built in America; the
contiguity of navigable rivers to immense forests making the
construction of ships less expensive in that country than in any
other.  But since the separation of America, and especially
since the register act of 1785, excluded all ships not British-
built from the trade of this country, ship-building has gene-
rally increased in it.  38 Vessels carrying about 3000 tons,
carpenters measure (about 4500 dead weight) have been built
here in 15 years; most of them for the ports of the Frith;
but some of them also for Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, etc.
One of the largest of them for the capital of Zealand.  The
ordinary contract-price for building with oak plank, is from
L. 4:5. to L. 6 per ton of the burden, and the hull is usu-
ally from 1/2 to 2/3 of the price of the ship when clear to
sail.  The ship timber used here is partly brought from
England, and partly imported from Hamburgh.  The
number of carpenters employed varies from 10 to 30.
The average of their daily wages is about 1 s. 8 d.

   Manufacture of Stockings.-The manufacturing of stockings
has been carried on here since the 1773.  11 Looms are at
present employed in it; 7 in what is called customer work,
i. e in working materials which families or individuals pre-
pare for their own comsumption, and 4 in manufacturing for
