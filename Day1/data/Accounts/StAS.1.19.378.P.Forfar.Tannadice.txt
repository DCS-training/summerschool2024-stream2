30 died.  This was not the consequence of any particular
distemper; but this year proved fatal to a number of old
people.  Annually there are about 20 marriages.  None

   As far as I can learn, the only Dissenters are a few of
the Episcopalian communion.  The parish includes about

The farmers, indeed, are universally convinced of the ad-
