troubles have yet been met with in the working of the coal; never
theless, all of them to the east seem to be a troubled field, where
the metals are found in all directions.
  The quantity of coals put out per week by the tree pits may be
above 1200 tons, at 7s. 6d. per ton. The wages of the colliers are all
equalized. The worst as well as the best pitmen receive 5s. per
day, or L. 1, 10s. a week, or L. 78 Sterling per annum!

  Manufactures.-These form the chief distinction of this parish.
About the year 1767 or 1768, the idea was entertained of making
the parish a manufacturing one. The Rev. Mr Henry Miller, a
man of great spirit and enterprise, having succeded to the fine
fortune of his late brother, the celebrated bookseller in the Strand,
London, projected an inkle factory, and established it, with some

  Shortly after that, about 1773, the printing of calicoes was begun
at Fereneze, on the banks of the Levern. It was at that time
deemed a great work. Its extent may be easily conceived from the
excise duty paid, and its yearly expenditure. The first was about
L. 3000 Sterling, and the second about L. 2000 yearly. It con-
tinued long the only printfield in the parish. Bleachfields became
the rage, and these in their turn,-many of them, at least,-have
become printfields, so that now the bleachfields and printfields, as
seen above, are equal in number.
  Bleachfields.-The first bleachfield was formed about 1773, by
the late Peter Adair, Esq. of Cross Arthurlie. He had been bleacher
at some of the Lismore fields in Ireland, his native country. De-
sirous of change of place, he came so Scotland. In sailing up the
Clyde, nothing struck him so much as not to see a single bleachfield
on its banks. To set down one, he thought, would be a good specu-
