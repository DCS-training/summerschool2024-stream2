rels, which are just carried on with the flock of lambs to which
they belong.  Now the goat, in the wild and uncultivated
parts of the country, is an animal of much larger bone, and
far hardier than the sheep.  About the time, therefore, that
James VI. left Scotland, and when the manufactures, com-
merce and agriculture of that kingdom began to decline, it is
highly probable, that the black faced breed of sheep, (that is,
the mongrels above mentioned), might be encouraged, so as to
stock the greater part of the farms calculated for sheep.
Woollen manufactures having scarcely any existence in Scot-
land, and the English being hardly able to work their own
wool, the only objects that could interest a Scotch farmer, as to
sheep, were the ease with which they could be preserved, the
flavour of their flesh, and the weight of their carcases.  In
all these respects, the mongrels, bred betwixt the sheep and
the goat, are superior, especially to the small white faced.
sheep already mentioned, the wool of which was of such un-
common fineness.  The mongrels are constantly black faced,
and in their form differ little from the sheep thus distinguished.
Two or three removes might indeed produce all the distinction
that obtains.  This mongrel breed, (half sheep and half goat),
however much they might suit ancient times of barbarism,
ought no longer to be preserved, at a period, when the proper
management of sheep, and the great profits of sheep farming,
when skifully' conducted, are so much better understood.

   Reptiles, Birds and Plants.-The animals and plants found
in this parish, have in them little of singularity.  The small
and deadly coluber, said to be found in Galloway, has very
probably existence, though this reptile may be rare.  This
probability is admitted, not only from numerous traditions,
but because the writer of this account has once or twice
met with a copper-coloured worm, or little serpent, differing
