Sanday, belonging to the proprietor of the ground, is called
steelbow.

   Measurement and Culture.-The only map of these islands
is that done by Mr Murdoch M'Kenzie, who surveyed
them in 1746 or 1747.  As his principal intention was to
survey the sea-coasts, the area, or true extent of the surface
of there islands cannot, perhaps, be exactly ascertained, by
reason, too, of the very irregular figure of the isle of Sanday.
But as Mr M'Kenzie makes the length of the isle of Sanday
to be 12 miles, and its mean breadth nearly 1 1/2 miles, this is
18 square miles; and, by the most exact measurement of his
map, made by the assistance of Mr John Trail of Burness pa-
rish, the island of Sanday contains 19 square miles; and the isle
of North Ronaldshay 4 square miles.  If then the isle of Sanday
contains 19 square miles, and as 640 acres English measure
make a square mile, then 640 x 19=12, 160 acres, in the
isle of Sanday.  If the isle of North Ronaldshay contains 4
square miles, then 4 x 640=2560.-The quantity of acres
employed in raising corn, roots, etc. cannot be ascertained
with any degree of precision, as there is no survey or mea-
surement taken of the several farms, one or two excepted.
The number of acres employed in raising cabbages, turnips,
or potatoes, is very small, when compared with what is em-
ployed in raising bear or bigg, and oats, which two last are
generally in equal quantities, and they alternately succeed each
other.  In the opinion of the most intelligent farmers here,
the arable grounds may be computed at from 11 to 22 acres
to each plough in the island of Sanday.  As the farms are
small, and many ploughs kept in the isle of North Ronald-
shay, it is supposed there is not more than 8 or 9 acres to a
