fertile, and well improved, rented, as before stated, at L. 17.
Adjoining to which, on the east, lies a feu of John Bow-
maker's, about 11 acres, now occupied by an ingenious
cart-wheel and plough-wright and smith, the only conside-
rable mechanic in this parish; his rent L. 14 Sterling; these
acres are remarkably good and well cultivated; they reach
to the glebe of Whitsom on the east, which glebe is rather
incommoded by a feu of a small fraction of an acre, and a
house upon it, inhabited by one old woman on the north of
the manse; and still more effectually has this glebe been
hurt by clay huts; a small inclosure of 4 good acres, now
rented at L. 6, on the south side of the glebe, (which the
ministers of this parish had very long possessed at a small
rent), being taken from them on a pique of the Laird of
Wedderburn, and the resumption ratified by the Court of
Session; it now belongs to the Earl of Wemyss.

   7.  Handle's-hill, a gradually ascending ridge of a consi-
derable length, leads from the manse eastward to the vil-
lage of Whitsom.  Handie's-hill belongs to the Earl of
Wemyss, and is one of there farms afterwards to be men-
tioned, as constituting the very considerable farm occupied
by John Hogarth.

   8.  The village of Whitsom, the only one now in the
united parishes, is very inconsiderable, and has no trade
nor manufacture of any kind; it is principally formed by
the house and offices of the farmer of Whitsom on the west
end; the house and offices of a feuer at the east end; a
fine modern house of a feuer on the south-east; the school-
master's house and school, with a few private weavers and
shoemakers, there constitute the whole village, which con-
tains 143 souls.  The farm at the west end of Whitsom
belongs to-Boswell of Blackadder, Esq; rented at
