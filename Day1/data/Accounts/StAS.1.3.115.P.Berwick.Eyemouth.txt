sixteen or seventeen feet of water in the harbour; which is
capable of receiving vessels from three to four hundred tons,
according as they are more flat, or more sharp built, and
which afterwards can, upon a greater flow of tide, be got into
a more advantageous birth.  Another advantage to the exe-
cuting the proposed design arises from a great quantity of
rough rocks that lie at the north westerly point of the bay,
very proper for building the outsides of the body of the pier,
the insides of which may be done with rough stones, won or
blasted from the rocks, neighbouring to that upon which the
pier is proposed to be built.  By this means, the pier may be
executed at a trisle of expence, in proportion to the extent and
utility of the design; for the rocks, that are represented with-
in the intended pier, will be removed and made smooth, so as
to procure an addition of harbour-room at little or no charge,
as they will be used within the pier.  When this is done, there
will be an addition of harbour-room in the space between the
elbow before mentioned and the pier-heads, capable of hold-
ing thirty ships of middling size, with sufficient passage; and
which, in time of war, will be very useful on this coast, not
only for the refuge of coasters from the enemy, but, in bad
weather, for privateers, and the smaller sized vessels acting of-
fensively."

   Previous to the erection of the first pier, there was very
little fair trade carried on; but, ever since it was built, much
corn and meal have been brought into the county, and shipped
here, for Leith and other markets, to the extent of 20,000
bolls annually, and, in some years, more than double that
quantity.  For several years past, there has not been a single
smuggler residing in this parish.  The former dealers in that
illicit trade are now all dead, or removed to distant parts.
Not one of them died rich, and the far greatest part of them
