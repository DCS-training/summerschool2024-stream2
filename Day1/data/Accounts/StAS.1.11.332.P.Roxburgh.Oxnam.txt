     Statistical Account

communication is greatly facilitated.  Not long ago, small
coal was brought from Ryechester, and great coal from Ital,
on horseback, but they are now brought in carts, which have
been universally adopted since the bettering of the roads.

   Disadvantages.-One of the chief disadvantages, the greatest
part of this parish labours under, is its distance from coal,
which is still, notwithstanding, the cheapest fuel to those who
have horses, but which poor people cannot afford to purchase.
A two-horse cart-load of coal, from Ryechester, costs 12 s. 6 d.,
and one from Ital costs about 14 s. 6 d.  Though this parish
abounds in excellent peats and turf, yet the most populous
parts have no claim to them, and are but scantily supplied
with turf, of far inferior quality, from a moor, once common,
and which still goes by that name.  Another growing disad-
vantage is, the depopulation of the parish, by suffering the
cottage houses to fall into decay; whereby the country is de-
prived of many useful members of society, and the tenant of
aid for carrying on his labours, especially in harvest, when he
is overtaken by storms, particularly of wind, which often do
great and irreparable damage to the valuable productions of
the year.

   General Character.-The people are industrious, sober, and
economical, and seem to have no inclination either for a mili-
tary or a seafaring life.  They are friendly to one another,
and hospitable to strangers.  The labouring part support their
families in a very decent manner, and give their children a
tolerable education.  Even in 1783, when the pensions of the
poor were doubled by the failure of crop 1782, no family in
the parish solicited relief from the heritors, nor were supplied
with provisions, at reduced prices, as was the case in many
other parishes.
