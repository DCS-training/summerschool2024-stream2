black loam, lying upon limestone.  The lands upon the 
banks of the Ad are all cultivated, and produce, for the
most part, tolerable crops of oats, barley, and potatoes;
but they are often injured from the overflowings of the
river, occasioned by the wet seasons.  The air is generally
moist, and the climate rainy, which renders farming here
very precarious, and often unprofitable; the low grounds
otherwise might turn out to very good account, and as ca-

great and rapid augmentation of grass-farms within these 
15 years for, the more discerning natives, who
