through the year; they are now paid for the piece of work,
at certain fixed rates.  Within these 10 or 12 years, a con-
siderable rise has taken place, on most of the articles of living.
The following table, shews the price, of a few of the most
common articles at different periods.

   Mutton, veal and lamb, were formerly sold without being
weighed at so much per quarter; they are now sold by weight,
and regulated by the Stirling market, which is generally 3 d
or 3 d 1/2 per lib.  Dutch weight.  Beef is seldom killed except
about Martinmass, and is sold for 4 s or 4 s 6 d per stone.  It
is hardly necessary to take notice of the prices of grain, which

so low as 13 s 4 d or 12 s 6 d; but 15 s or 16 s, may be consi-
dered as its price on an average.

under the inspection of a mistress, are employed by a compa-
ny in Glasgow in tambouring muslins.  In Buchlyvie, some
of the newly invented jennies for spinning cotton have been
