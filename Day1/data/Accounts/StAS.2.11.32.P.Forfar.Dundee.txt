   The blanks in the preceding table refer to the years in which
the shore-dues were let to tenants; during the other years in which
the gross and net sums are given, and the expanse of collecting the
dues is noted, the commissioners themselves were the collectors.
Besides the actual expense of collecting the dues, which varies
from L.3, 16s. 4d. to L.5, 18s. 10d. per cent., there is a sum added
for incidental expenses, varying from L.79 to L.170 a-year.
   It is proper to state here, that the rates levied at this port have
been reduced more than once since 1821; and particularly, that,
since the last act came into operation, in June 1830, the dues on
several articles have been greatly reduced,--the reduction on coals
and grain alone for the last year amounting to L.450, and that on
non-freemen, &c. to L.951.
   When the plan for the new harbour was adopted in 1815, it
was considered to be so extensive, especially when compared with
what preceded it, that it was generally believed that the accom-
modation it promised would exceed the necessities of the trade of
Dundee for very many years to come. It was soon discovered,
however, that this opinion was not correct. Several years since,
the want of sufficient birthage was matter of complaint; and mea-
sures were taken as soon as possible for having the ground of this
complaint removed. A new harbour bill was applied for, and ob-
tained, vesting the shore dues permanently in a board of trustees.
A plan was adopted for extending the tide-harbour, and for con-
verting the greater part of it into a wet dock, and for other im-
