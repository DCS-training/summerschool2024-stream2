or Balcastle, on that account; and, it rises regularly on all
sides at an angle of 45 degrees, so that the form of it re-
sembles the top of a hat; but it is not equally high all a-
round.  On the south it is about 40 feet, on the north only

session.
   There are several circular fortifications, called chesters,
which bear evident murks of great antiquity.  The most re-
markable are at Auchincloch, Auchinvillie, and Townhead.
They are all similar to each other, and much about the same
