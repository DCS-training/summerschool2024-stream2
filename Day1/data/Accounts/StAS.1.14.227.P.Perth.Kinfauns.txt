     Of Kinfauns.

   Situation and Character of the People.-A remarkable
change has taken place within there 30 years past, in the
dress, manners, and cleanliness of the people; the natu-
ral consequence of the influx of money.  The great rise
of wages has considerably meliorated the situation of
such as depend upon their labour for the support of their
families.  And were the houses of cottagers, and of those
in the inferior ranks of life better, it would be a vast
addition to their comfort.  Some excellent ones have
been lately built by proprietors.  If some instances of
more straitened circumstances occur amongst the poorer
people, yet they do not seem to produce discontent.  It
is not known that any have died of want.  None, for
many years back, have been destitute of employment;
and there have been no emigrations.  No person, in the
memory of the oldest man alive, has been tried for any
crime, or banished.
   The people are rather above middle size; they are
healthy, and of a good looking, decent appearance.  Their
attendance upon public worship is regular; their ideas
of religion are rational.

   Advantages.-This parish and district derive great
advantage from the turnpike road lately made between
Perth and Dundee; and from their vicinity to a navi-
gable river.  By the last of there, immediate access is

The yearly wages of a ploughman, or farming servant, have risen from
4 l. and 5 l. to 8, 9, and 10 guineas; those of an upper servant 12 l., and
often more.  Cottagers employed as farming servants are paid nearly in
the same proportion, after making deduction for their houses, and for
land, if they possess any.  The wages of women servants in faire houses, are
3 l.; of a house carpenter a-day. 1 s. 8 d.; of a mason, 1 s. 6 d. and 1 s. 8 d.;
of a tailor, with visuals, 6 d. and 8 d.; of a common labourer, 1 s., without
