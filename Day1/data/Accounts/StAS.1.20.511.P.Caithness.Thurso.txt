perly attended to when necessary.  But the peasantry and
servants are sometimes much neglected at present, insomuch,
that on a servant's being seized with any contagious disor-
der, they are sometimes turned out to find quarters where
they best can; and in consequence of their being placed in
that unfortunate situation, many must suffer.
   It has therefore occured to Mr Williamson, that it would
be advisable to have an hospital in Thurso, for persons thus
circumstanced; and it is proposed to have, as a measure of
great humanity, and likely to be generally useful, one
erected by the subscriptions of the merchants in the town,
and the gentlement in the neighbourhood.

     CHAP. VII. EDUCATION.

   SECT. I.  Schools for Boys.-In the town there are two
public schools, viz. the parochial or grammar school, and a
charity school, upon the establishment of the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland.  The first is not in so flourishing
a state at present as could be wished; but the other is doing
well, under the management of a faithful, attentive, and
diligent teacher.  Besides these, there are some private
scools, at which children are taught reading; and from the
best account which could be obtained, the number of scho-
lars in the different schools is as follows:
