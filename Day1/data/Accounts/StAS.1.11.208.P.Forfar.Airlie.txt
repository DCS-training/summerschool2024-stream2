     (Presbytery of Meigle-County of Forfar-Synod of Angus
     and Mearns.

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES STORMONTH, Minister.

     Form, Extent, and Soil.

   THE form of this parish is an irregular parallellogram.  In
length it is between 5 and 6 miles; in breadth between
3 and 4, and in some places more.  The soil is various, ge-
nerally a light sand, or deep black; mould.

   Situation, Climate and Disease.-The parish may be divid-
ed into 2 districts.  About two thirds of it lie in Strathmore,
and the other forms the higher ground, which seems to ter-
minate the strath on the N.  In the former the climate is
mildest; but the air is most pure and healthy in the latter,
and freest from the fogs.  Rheumatisms, flow fevers, and
sometimes agues prevail, especially in the neighbourhood of
the mossy and swampy ground.
