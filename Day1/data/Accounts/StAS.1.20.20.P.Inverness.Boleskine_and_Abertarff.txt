is at least 24 miles in length, and in most parts from 10 to
12 miles in breadth.-It formerly contained two glebes,
one near Fort-Augustus, and the other at Boleskine; and
the latter place, though the north-east boundary of the pa-
rish, contained till lately the church and manse.  But this
having been found inconvenient, and the idea of religious
pennance exploded, they were, about 30 years ago, remo-

deriving its name from having been anciently a place of
worship; Drim signifying a ridge or height, and Teample
what it bears in the English language.  At this time
both the old glebes were annexed to the estate of Lovat,
then under the management of the Commissioners of forfeit-

man from preaching in two different places of Stratherrick,
as, when the church remained at Boleskine, he was in use
every second Sabbath, of performing worship at a place
called Bellaloin, about one mile distant from Drimtemple.

previous to the 15th century, the property of the Lovat fa-
mily; but who previously possessed it can only be learned
from tradition.  What leads to a belief that Abertarf was
inhabited by the Cummins, a very powerful and warlike
clan, is, that the place of Fort-Augustus, only called so from
the establishment of the garrison, is in the vulgar language
called Kilichujman, meaning the burial-ground of the Cum-
mins.  And an eminence on the hill to the east of Loch-
tarf is called Sui-Chuiman, or Cummins's resting-place.

called from the river Errick, rising in the mountains of
Strathdearn, and entering Lochness at Boleskine, Strath fig-
