     PRESBYTERY OF LOCHMABEN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.


         THE REV. DR SINGER, MINISTER.


        I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

  Name, Boundaries, &c.--THE ancient name of this parish was
Kilpatrick; now it is Kirkpatrick-Juxta, as being nearer to the
capital of Scotland than Kirkpatrick-Fleming, Kirpatrick-Dur-
ham- and Kirpatrick-Irongray, all of which appear to have de-
rived their names from the famous missionary.  He was a native
of Scotland, who at the call of Celestine, Bishop of Rome, went
to Ireland in 432, laboured there with eminent success during forty
years, and left a name highly regarded both in Ireland and in the
south and west of Scotland.
  The form of this parish is irregular, being bounded on the east
and north by Wamphray and Moffat; on the N. W. and west  by
Crawford and Closebum, and on the south by Johnstone parish.
It contains very nearly 33 square miles, or about 2l,000 English acres.
In the county map, the lands of Whiteholm, being in the county
of Lanark, were not included.
  The mountain range of Queensberry on the west runs irregu-
larly northward; another range of lower hills on the east extends in
a parallel direction, between 2 and 3 miles distant; and between
these ranges, is the pastoral valley of Kinnel Water.  Betwixt the
latter billy range and the river Annan, the tract of ground is nearly
2 miles broad and 8 miles long; and this consists of hill and vale,
and constitutes most of the richer and more valuable portion of the
parish.  It is mostly amble, though about one-tenth of the whole
is either rocky, or consists of lands formerly moor, but now improv-
ed, or of peat-moss either out for fuel or converted into meadow
land.
  Meteorology.--The temperature has improved sensibly by the
draining of mossy sheep-walks and cultivation of waste lands.  The
most frequent rains are from the S. W., and the most violent wind
