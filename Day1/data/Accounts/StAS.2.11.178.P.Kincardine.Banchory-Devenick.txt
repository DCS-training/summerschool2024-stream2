			PARISH OF BANCHORY DEVENICK.

		PRESBYTERY OF ABERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

		THE REV. GEORGE MORISON, D. D. MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--IN the Advocates' Library there has been found a do-
cument confirmation of what was formerly traditionals that the dis-
tinctive appellation of Devinick is derived from a wonder-working
saint of the name of Davinicus, who flourished about the year 887;
and of whose ministrations this parish was at one period the scene.
	Situation, Boundaries, &c.--The figure of the parish is extremely
irregular. It is situated partly in Kincardineshire, and partly in
A berdeenshire,--the River Dee being here the boundary of both
counties. The most elevated part of the Tollohill, the easter-
most of the range of Grampiaos, is in the Kincardineshire division
of the parish, and afforded a station for the gentlemen who were
employed by Government to make the trigonometrical survey of
the island. About tree miles of this parish is bounded by the sea.
	Topographical Appearances.--The coast is bold, rocky and
picturesque. Its undulations are numerous, with many inlets and
projections frequented by migratory sea-fowls, and wild pigeons,
but has no caves of great depth inland, and affords no safe anchor-
age; and only three harbours for fishing-boats--Findon, Port-
lethen, and Downees. At portlethen, in favourable weather, lime
and coals may be landed from small vessels, but the road from the
shore is very steep, insomuch that the tenant of the adjoining farm
has erected a machine for bringing up sea-weed for manure.
	The climate is healthy, and no disease is peculiar to the
district.
	Hydrography.--The Dee, which rises amongst the highest
mountains of Aberdeenshire, after a course of sixty miles, passes
through this parish, and is here, as has been said, the boundary
between Aberdeen and Kincardineshires. Its brdadth here may
be about 250 feet. It is liable to great floods, rising nine, ten,
