finished in 1790.  The trade upon it is already great, and is
rapidly increasing.  One of its first effects has been, to equa-
lize, in a great measure, the price of grain, throughout all the
corn-countries in Scotland; to the temporary loss of the
landholders, in the southern, and to the gain of those in the
northern districts.

   State of the Landed Property.-In the beginning of the
14th century, the whole parish, excepting the burgh lands of
Kirkintilloch, and the small barony of Welter-Gartshore,
(which has, for many generations, been possessed by that an-
tient and respectable family, the Gartshore of Gartshore,)
were the entire property of the noble family of Fleming.
But, in the long series of years, which has elapsed since that
period, that great estate has been gradually dismembered, part-
ly in forming establishments for the younger branches or con-
nexions of the family; and partly by supplying the enlarged
expences, required by those new modes of life, which have
been introduced in the progress of society.  The last remain-
der of it was sold off, in 1757:  And nothing now continues
in the prossesion of the former proprietors, but the feu-duties,
and some other casualties of feudal superiority.

   The Poor.-The poor of this parish are not numerous. The
weekly collections at the church-doors, have hitherto been
found more than sufficient for their support.  These happy
circumstances are to be ascribed chiefly, to the minute subdivi-
sions of the landed property in the parish, and to the general
manners, and personal habits, which usually attend agricultu-
ral industry.  But, it is to be feared, that if a greater propor-
tion of the inhabitants, shall be induced to apply themselves to
manufactures, one disadvantage which must necessarily arise
from this increase of industry, is such a change in the manners
