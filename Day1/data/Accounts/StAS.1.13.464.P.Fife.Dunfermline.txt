ferent from the northern, the mode of cultivating and crop-
ping is also different.  The arable land on the S. is ploughed
with Small's chain-plough, drawn by two horses.  In some
places on the N. the Scotch plough, drawn by four horses,
is used, and the ancient distinction between croft and out-
field preserved.  The whole manure is laid upon the croft,
which is constantly in village, while the outfield is occa-
sionally ploughed, and afterwards left to rest.  But this
mode of culture prevails only in a very few places, where
manure cannot be obtained without great expense.  On the
S. of the town, the land is highly cultivated, and produces
as luxuriant crops as any in the kingdom.  Farms are usu-
ally divided into different portions, and the crops are in the
following order:  After summer fallow, wheat is sown, the
next year, barley, the following year, grass, and last of all,
oats; some, after summer-fallow or potatoes, sow wheat,
pease and beans, barley, grass, and oats, in their order.
Wheat is generally sown in September and October; pease,
beans, and oats, from the middle of February to the end of
April; and barley, from the middle of March to the end
of May.  Potatoes are planted after the plough, about the
beginning or middle of April.  Hay is made from the
middle of June to the end of July.  The other crops are
usually reaped from the middle of August to the middle of
October; sometimes the harvest is earlier, and sometimes it 
is later.  Flour, oats, oatmeal, and barley, are imported;
wheat is exported.

   Kent.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 22, 127 Scotch.
It is difficult to ascertain the real rent, as many of the land-
holders possess their own lands.  In general, it is valued
according to its quality, and distance from the town of Dun-
fermline.  In the immediate vicinity, it is feued from L. 8
to L. 20; and less annually from L. 3 to L. 5 Sterling the
