Dundee market, in which the carts marked "Monifieth" are al-
ways looked out for by the purchaser.
  Fishdries.-All along the coast salmon-fishing is pursued. The
value of the fishings have much decreased of late years, owing
chiefly to the judicial prevention of stake-nets and sole-nets.
Common-haul or cobble-nets only can now be legally used. About
thirty hands are employed; and, though the season opens in the
beginning of February, little is done till the beginning of April.
About twenty years ago, the rent of the fishings was L.1500, when
729 fish have been known to be got during a tide at one station.
The rent at last letting was L.325, and the above number of fish
will hardly be got at one station during the whole season.
  Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce annually
raised in the parish is as follows:-

  Manufacturers.-Weaving is carried on to a considerable extent
in the parish, it being a kind of trade with some to bring the yarn
from Dundee, apportion it to the weavers around, recieve back
the webs, and carry them to Dundee.
	There is a large spinning-mill at the mouth of the Dighty, dri-
ven partly by water and partly by steam. When in full operation
it employs 130 hands. Half a mile farther up the river is an ex-
tensive bleaching work, giving employment at present to 90 work
people; but, when enlarged according to the present intention of
the proprietors, it will employ double that number. A smaller
bleaching work on the river stands idle and unfinished; and besides
these, other works are talked of, which, if trade prosper, will as-
suredly go on.
	In the village of Monifieth a foundry and machine-work are in

<FOOTNOTE>In this calculation we have given only the rent, the expense of nets, &c. and the
wages, since, taking the average of the last five years, the fishing have little more
than cleared themselves.
