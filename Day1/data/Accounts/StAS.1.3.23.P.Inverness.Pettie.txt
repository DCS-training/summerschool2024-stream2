   Population.-There was an actual numeration made of the
catechesable persons in this parish, about 16 years ago, when
they amounted to about 1370.  Since that time the popula-
tion has diminished; for by a recent numeration for the pur-
pose of this statement, the number of persons above eight
years old is 1302, and of children under that age is 216, in
all 1518 souls.  In Dr Webster's report, the number of souls
is 1643.
   The population of this parish appears to have undergone
very great changes, during the last century and a half.  For,
by an old register of births, that has every appearance of ac-
curacy, the average of births for the ten years, between 1650
and 1660, is 51.  From that till 1704, there is no re-
gister extant; but, from the year last mentioned down to the 
present time, there are registers of the births and marriages,
but with chasms of some years in different places, and appear-
ances of negligence and inaccuracy.  During the ten years
from 1704 to 1714, the population appears to have been
very great; "for the average of births recorded is 71, and of
marriages 16.  But, form that period downwards to the pre-
sent, it has been constantly decreasing; sometimes rapidly,
and at other times more slowly.  What is very remarkable,
the average of births for the ten years, between 1750 and
1760, is 50, that is, nearly the same that it had been a cen-
tury before.  Since the 1760, it has continued to diminish,
till it has come to the state already mentioned.  What is the
average of births at present, or for the last ten years, cannot
be ascertained with exactness, as the register has not been
kept with accuracy.
   Different causes have contributed to diminish the popula-
tion of this parish, during the last thirty years.  Though
the farms in this parish are far from being large, they were
smaller, and of course more numerous, before that time.
