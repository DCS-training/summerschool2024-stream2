blished woollen manufactures for cloth, particularly for Eng-
lish blankets.  He also erected a waulk mill, to promote
this useful undertaking; but his death marred the progress of
those public spirited schemes.  He built also an extensive
brewery, which is still carried on with great success; and
great quantities of the ale and porter, brewed in it, are export-
ed to England.  We have likewise a corn mill and a good
bleachfield in the parish.

   Roads.-The roads are very bad.  They are repaired by a con-
version of the statute labour.  Last winter, however, (1792-3),
an act of parliament was obtained for making several roads
near Kelso, and establishing toll-bars.  By this act, three new
roads will be made through this parish, which will be of great
service in this part of the country, where they have been much
wanted for these many years past.

   Church.-The church is very small, was built about 34
years ago, and is very insufficient.  There are some Quakers
and Episcopals, but no Roman Catholics.  The number of
Seceders is not easily ascertained, as all the denominations of
them have houses of worship in Kelso, and Edenham lies so
near it, that many of the inhabitants attend these meetings; but
all the principal farmers attend the Established Church.  The
King is undoubted patron.

   Heritors and Poor.-The number of heritors are four.  As
none of them reside in the parish, the collections at the church
doors are but trifling; in consequence of which the poor are
obliged to be maintained by assessments, regularly laid on for
their support.
