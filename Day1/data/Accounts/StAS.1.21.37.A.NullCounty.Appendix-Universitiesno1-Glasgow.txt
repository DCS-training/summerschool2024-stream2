taught in public schools, the professor is under the necessity
of instructing a great number in the very elements of that lan-

branches of Greek literature, introducing a variety of disqui-
sitions on the general principles of grammar, of which the
regular structure of that language affords such copious il-
lustration.

this part of the academical course.  The present professor, af-
ter a short analysis of the powers of the understanding, and an
explanation of the terms necessary to comprehend the subjects
of his course, gives a historical view of the rise and progress
