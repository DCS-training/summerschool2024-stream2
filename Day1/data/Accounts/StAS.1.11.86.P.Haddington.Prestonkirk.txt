   Antiquities-A place of religious worship, it would appear,
has subsisted on the same spot where the church now stands,
as far back as a thousand years.  It is mentioned, in the Saxon
Annals, under the name of Ecclesia Sancti Baldridi, the
tutelar saint of the place: And that record bears, that the
