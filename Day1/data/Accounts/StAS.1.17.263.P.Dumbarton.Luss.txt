of maid servants, from 3 L. to 4 L.  The usual day's wages of
men are from 8 d. to 10 d. with maintenance, and from 1 s.
to 1 s. 3 d. without it; of women, 6 d. with it.-The price
of provisions of every kind is very much regulated by the
prices in Dumbarton and Greenock, which are the nearest
market towns.  For these 4 years past, oat meal has sold from
16 s. 6 d. to 20 s. per boll; the best lambs, weighing from
15 lb. to 18 lb. from 4 s. to 5 s.; a hen, from 10 d. to 1 s.;
a chicken from 3 d. to 4 d.; butter, at 12 s. the stone; cheese,
from 4 s. 6 d. to 6 s. the stone.-Coals, including the freight
from Glasgow or Scotstown, cost from 6 s. 6 d. to 10 s. the
cart, which should be 12 cwt.  Peats and sticks are the
common fuel, and not much less expensive.

   State of Property, etc.-There are 3 heritors, one of whom
resides occasionally.  Sir JAMES COLQUHOUN of Luss, Bart.
is proprietor of far the greatest part ot the lands in the pa-
rish.  The family residence is about 3 miles south from Luss,
at Rosedoe or Rosedow, i. e. the black promontory or head-
land, a name which is not now very applicable to its as it is
finely wooded, and the black moss which once abounded
there is now mostly converted into meadow.  There is an
excellent modern house there, which commands some noble
views of the lake.  It was built by the late Sr James Col-
quhoun, who resided in the parish for many years, the in-
fluence of whose authority and example, in checking all ten-
dency to disorder, and in promoting the interests of virtue
and religion, is still sensibly felt, and his memory, therefore,
much and justly respected.

   Minerals.-There are two slate quarries, one upon the
estate of Camstraddan, and the other upon the estate of Luss.
From the former of these, for 5 years past, from 250,000
