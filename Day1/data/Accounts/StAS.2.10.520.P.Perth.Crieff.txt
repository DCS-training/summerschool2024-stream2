some of the other duties of a parish which is much too large for
any one man pastorslly to superinted.
   There are three Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish,
execlusive of a Popish one, viz. the United Secession, the Relief,
and the Original Seceders. The ministers of the former are
paid of L. 105 and L. 94 per annum respectively, with allowance
for sacramental expenses. The Original Seceders have no stated
minister; and the Priest who died lately has hitherto had no success-
sor. There are some adherents beloging to other denominations,
who have no place of worship, and no minister in Crieff, but their
designations and their numbers may be gathered from the follow-
ing abstract of a survey of the parish, quoad sacra, which was made
by the kirk-session in the year 1835.
