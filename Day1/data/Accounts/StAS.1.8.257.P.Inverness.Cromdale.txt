     of Cromdale.

In all the parishes southward from this, the English alone is
spoken; but here, both languages are breached daily.  In
a few years hence, the English will be the only language, as
the people ardently wish their children to read the scriptures;
and for this purpose, often, in the winter, 4 or 5 schools are
employed at once in the parish at their own expence.

   School.-The parochial school is taught at Cromdale.  The
salary is 200 merks, paid by the heritors.  The emolu-
ments of the schoolmaster, as session-clerk, with dues of bap-
tisms, etc. amount to 3 L. or 4 L. Sterling, besides school fees.

   Village.-Grantown is a village erected under the influence
of the Grant family, it being little more than 20 years, since
the place, where it stands, was a poor rugged piece of heath.
It now contains from 300 to 400 inhabitants, some of whom
are as good tradesmen as any in the kingdom.  Shoe-
makers, taylors, weavers of wool, linen, and stockings,
blacksmiths, wrights, masons, and 12 merchants keep re-
gular shops in it.  There are 2 established schools.  One
of the teachers has 30 L. Sterling of salary, exclusive of the
emoluments arising from his office; 10 L. of which he has by
way of gratuity from Sir James Grant; 10 L. as the interest of
mortified money, from the presbytery of the bounds; and 10 L.
from the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge; with art
excellent dwelling house at Sir James Grant's expence.  The
boys are taught reading, writing, accounts, Latin, and French.
They amount to from 50 to 80, and they excel in reading the
English language grammatically.  There is another school es-
tablished in the town, which is taught by a woman.  Young
children to the number of 30 or 40 constantly attend, and are
not only initiated, by her in the first principles of letters, but
