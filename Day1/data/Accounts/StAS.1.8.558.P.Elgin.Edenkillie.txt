this parish, are still more extensive than the natural woods,
About the year 1767, the present Earl of Moray began to
fill up the vacancies in the old forest of Darnway, and has since
gone on every year, extending his plantations all around his
ancient Castle of Darnway, and near to Castle-Stewart, in the
parish of Petty.  The quantity of ground planted by his Lord-
ship, including the ancient forest, is considerably above 3,400
acres.  Part indeed lies in the neighbouring parish of Dyke,
and part in the parish of Petty, in Inverness-shire, but by much
the greatest part in this parish.  The nurseries from which
there plantations have been made, except a little at the begin-
ning, have been all raised at Darnway.  Scotch firs, planted
cut at two years old, from the feed-bed, are used as nurses;
and as soon as they are fit to afford shelter, the more valuable
kinds of forest trees, principally oaks, are planted amongst
them.  There oaks, at two years old, are planted from the
seed-bed into the nursery, where they remain three years; and
then, as above mentioned, are planted among the firs.  When
the oaks, and other deciduous trees, are sufficiently advanced,
the whole of the Scotch firs are to be cleared away; and some
of the earlier plantations are so well grown, as to admit of the
firs being completely cut out.  Others of them are only clear-
ed of the firs in part; and this operation of clearing goes on
gradually and regularly.  The Noble Planter has already the
satisfaction of beholding his public-spirited plan fully answer-
ing his most sanguine expectations; to which he is well enti-
tled, as every part of the plan, which is extremely simple,
has been carefully and accurately executed; and proper atten-
tion paid to the preservation of the plantations, which are all
in the most flourishing condition, and already greatly beautify
the face of the country.  Having obtained an accurate account
of the number of trees planted by the Earl of Moray, since
