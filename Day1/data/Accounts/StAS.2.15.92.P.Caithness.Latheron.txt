There is a very comfortable manse close by it. Both are very
compact, and a great ornament to the district in which they are
placed. The latter, viz. Lybster, was built by subscription in
1836. It is a substantial, well-finished, and. most comfortable
church. It, contains 805 sittings, and cost L-830. It is placed
in the village of Lybster, from'which it takes its name, and to the
importance of which it contributes not less by its utility than its
acknowledged ornament

                   III.-POPULATION.
From the want of correct records, it is impossible to ascertain
the ancient state of the population with accuracy. There can be
no doubt, however, that it has been progressing during the last
century at a veryrapid rate. It is stated in the former Statistical
Account, that. the population had nearly doubled during the
seventy years preceding 1794,-when it amounted to 4006; and
such has been the extraordinary rapidity of the increase during
the forty years that have since elapsed, that it is now fully double
that amount. Where this extraordinary increase of country po-
pulation is to terminate, and by what means; a suitable provision is
to be made for their comfortable support, it is difficult to imagine.
At present there are no indications of a decrease, unless sheep-
farming. which commenced some time ago, should become more
general.
   The chief cause of the recent astonishing increase in the
population is unquestionably the great and growing extent to
which the herring-fishing has been prosecuted along the whole
coast, and the extraordinary success with which it has generally
been attended. Upon its permanency or failure, therefore, main-
ly depends the future continued increase or rapid decrease of the
population.
