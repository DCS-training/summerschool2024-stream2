Fevers often occasion a considerable mortality.  The dropsy
sometimes makes its appearance here; in which cases it is
supposed to be brought on by the excessive drinking of raw
spirits.

   Springs, Rivers, etc.-In this parish are several mineral
springs, all seemingly chalybeate.  The most remarkable of
these issues at the foot of a rock at Craigtown, on the sea
shore.  The river Halladale runs through the strath of the
same name.  Torss divides the parish of Reay from the pa-
rishes of Thurso and Halkirk.  Of the lakes, which are nu-
merous, but small, the principal is the Loch of Shuriry.  The
fishes caught in the rivers are salmon and trouts.  The sal-
mons in the river Halladale, weigh commonly from 14 to 20
pounds.  The fishing of Halladale may be estimated at 50
or 60 barrels annually.  The river Torss yields from 12 to
18 barrels of salmon in the year.  The larger salmons are
estimated at 3 d. a pound; the smaller at 2 d. In the months
of June and July, they are in their greatest perfection.  Loch
Sleital, in Strathalladale, is remarkable for its large red trouts.
The river of Halladale might be made navigable to boats for
several miles.

   Sea coast, etc.-The extent of the sea-coast is computed to
be about 9 miles.  It affords the two bays of Sandside and
Bighouse; and the creeks of Portskerry, which is supposed
to be susceptible of considerable improvement, and of which
the situation is thought an eligible one for a fishing village.
The most improvable, and best harbour in the parish, is the
water mouth of Halladale, where small decked vessels can lie
in great safety.  The principal head-land is Fresgo-head, near
Sandside.  Wrecks have been frequent upon the coast.  A
brigantine, laden with iron and hemp, was wrecked at the
