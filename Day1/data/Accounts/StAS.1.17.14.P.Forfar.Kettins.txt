property of Lord Aboyne*.  It stands in a plain, and is
surrounded by stately plantations.  A detached part of the
parish, called Bandirran, lies about 6 miles S. W. and con-
tains a gentleman's seat.  The greatest part of the parish is
level, and inclosed with hedges of thorn, or fenced with
stone dykes.  The south part gradually rises to the summit
of the Sidla hills, and is partly covered with heath and pas-
ture.

   Villages, Rivulets, and Mills.-Kettins has 7 villages be-
longing to it, and is itself the largest.  The village of that
name, where the church stands, is pleasantly situated on a
rivulet, which descends from the Sidla hills, and passing
through Coupar, loses itself in the Isla, near 5 miles W. of
the latter town, after having turned 5 mills in its course.
The number of rivulets within the parish is 2, and they
serve 10 mills.

   Soil.-The soil is various.  A great part of the low parish,
the higher grounds chiefly, and the hill ground, have a light
thin soil, and are partly covered with heath and pasture.  In
many places a strong red clay or mortar prevails, and in
some it is wet and spungy.  The greater part of the parish,
however, is tolerably fertile.  Much of this district is let to
small tenants, who, besides farming, follow some trades,
chiefly that of weaving coarse linen.

gave title to the ancient and honourable family of HALIBUR-
TON, the chief of that name.
