and other vermin, induced people to destroy them; but they
did not know when to stop, and to went too far.  The woods
are now better looked after.  The Dukes of Athol have plant-
ed a good deal, and Mr Robertson of Lude some.  The pre-
vailing kings of timber are birch, alder, ash, oak, popular, and
hazle; the shrubs are willow, broom, bog-gall, heath, &c.
Wood thrives very well in this country.

   Game, etc.-In an extensive forest, and over many other
parts of the hills, there are a great number of red deer; in
and near the woods, there are roe-deer; almost every where
there are plenty of hares, and, on the high mountains, white
hares, which, in summer, have bluish spots.-In the
hills and woods, are foxes, wild cats, pole cats, martins,
weasles, and shrew mice: in the waters, otters.  We have also
two species of the badger.-Of the winged kind, there are,
on the tops of the mountains, ptarmagans; in the hills, grouse;
near the woods, black game, and patridges below.  The
ravenous birds are, eagles, buzzards, hawks of various kinds,
ravens, carion crows, and magpies.  The migratory birds are
similar to those usual in the Highlands.

   Population.-In August 1791, there were living in the u-
nited parishes, 3120 fouls, viz. 1480 males, and 1640 fe-
males.  Of that number, 758 were under eight years of age.
The yearly of marriages, for the last 10 years, was
nearly 26; and the yearly average of baptisms, for the same
period, was 94.  Besides the number above mentioned, there
is a considerable number of young people, belonging to the
parish, serving in the east and west; of whom part will pro-
bably return, and part will not.

   Through it cannot be exactly determined, the probability is,
that the number of the people in this parish is diminished,
