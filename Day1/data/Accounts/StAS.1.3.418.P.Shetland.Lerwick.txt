   Population.-The population of the parish of Lerwick
has not increased much since its first erection.  The
number of families in the country part of the parish is  nearly

that, in the year 1701, the number of inhabitants in the
town amounted to 700.  From an enumeration now made,
(anno 1791), there are living in the town 903, and in the
country part of the parish, 356; total, 1259.  Of these
there are,
