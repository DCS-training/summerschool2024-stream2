   Black Cattle.-The natural verdure of the soil, the tem-
perature of the climate, and the great abundance of shelter
afforded from the inequalities of the surface, concur to render
this one of the finest grazing countries in Scotland:  And the
farmers, as might be expected, have long been famous for
their skill in the management of cattle.  Trials have been
made of different sorts of black cattle, from England, Ire-
land, and the Isle of Man; but none have been found to an-
swer so well as the true Galloways.  The farmers here are
as attentive to the shapes of cattle, as a jockey is to the propor-
tions of a horse.  Even an eye or an ear is not to be overlook-
ed.  Some of their observations may appear whimsical; but
in general, they are certainly well founded; for one of good
proportions is always easily kept, soon fattened, and, as Mr.
Ramsay has observed, "commonly tells well at the end of
"the balance."  It is to be regretted, that few of the cattle
here are kept to sufficient age, or fed out for slaughter. When
this is done, no beef in the world exceeds it. They are com-
monly bought up for the English markets, at 2 and 3 years
old.  An ox or heiser, of 1 year old, sells from 3 L. to 5 L.; of
2, from 5 L. to 7 L.; and of 3, from 7 L. to 10 L.

   Sheep and Horses.-There are six different kinds of sheep
in this parish: the Spanish sheep, introduced by Lord DAER
the Shetland, introduced by Mr. THOMPSON; the Cheviot
fine-woolled sheep brought from the shire of Galloway; the
common muir or black faced sheep, the mug, and the Bake-
well breeds.  The 3 first kinds were only introduced last
year. It is intended to try a pure breed of all the different
kinds, and also to cross them various ways, which will most
probably lead to useful discoveries for the improvement of
wool. The muir sheep are only bought in annually, and fatted
for the butcher.  The mug and Bakewell, or an intermixture
