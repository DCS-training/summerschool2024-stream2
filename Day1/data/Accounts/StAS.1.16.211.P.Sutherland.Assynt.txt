be no saying to what great number the inhabitants might
increase, and live much more comfortable than they pre-
sently do.  Even although gentlemen of enterprise should
not come, villages might be built in or near the harbours,
which in course of time would not fail to produce the
aforesaid valuable purposes to the Honourable proprietors
and the people at large.  By either of the above taking
place, the parish would find a market at home for all its
produce, and be able to make better returns.  It is as easy
and safe to sail to any part of the world from this coast,
and return to it, as any other part whatever of Great Bri-
tain.  In short, the height of this parish should not be de-
populated for fear of further encroachments.  It is a pity
a charity schoolmaster were not settled with a moderate
salary at Ned, and another at Ledmore.  Preparatory to
the above suggested, and other improvements, the proprie-
tors ought to send a person of sound judgment to view and
determine on the whole.
