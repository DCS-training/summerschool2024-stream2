   ter of a mile from the town to the eastward, is an elegant villa,
   and commands an extensive view of the surrounding country.
     Parochial Registers.-Registers of births, baptisms, and mar--
   riages are regularlykept. There is a disposition, however, often
   shown to neglect the registration of births, merely to save the small
   fee of ls. charged for registration. Few think of registering
   deaths and burials, and the register of these is very defective.
   The earliest register of births, &c. is dated May 1675.  That of
   marriages bears the same date.

		According to the Government census, the population was

     According to the above returns, it would appear that the popu-
   lation has fluctuated considerably during the last forty years.
   From 1801 to 1811, a diminution seems to have taken place, which
   was followed, during the next ten years, by a considerable increase.
   This may perhaps be accounted or by the number of men who
   entered the army, and who were, during the war, withdrawn from
   the parish; many of these served in the militia regiments, which
   were stationed chiefly in England, and had their families along
   with them. The diminution in the population which has occur-
   red during, the last ten years, it is not so easy to explain, as the
   number of families during the same-period has rather increased.
   The most probable solution, however of this is, that a number of single
   persons have of late years emigrated to the Colonies. There are
   generally resideiat,iu this parish three or four families of independ-
   ent fortune, although at present none of the principal heritors
   reside on their estates; but several of their houses are occupied
   by gentlemen of independent fortune as tenants. There are, be-
