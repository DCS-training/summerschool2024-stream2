south declivity of which hill the church stands.  It has
been some time:written Bendochy, being a corruption of
the form of writing, which occurs in the presbytery book,
the e having been therein written backwards, the end of

short.  The name inscribed on the communion cups and
plates is Bendothy, A.D. 1786.

   Western Division.-That part of the parish which is in
continuation is almost all under cultivation.  That part in
which the church stands, W. of the confluence of Eroch and
Isla, is generally easy level ground.  It consists chiefly of a
gentle ridge, rising with an almost insensible ascent from
the river Eroch, and running from thence south-westward,
parallel to the Isla, having its highest summit at Muirhead,
opposite the church, from whence it declines again to the
westward.  The sides of this ridge decline gradually to-
wards the Isla upon one side, and to the Monkmire on the
other, which separates it from the parish of Blairgowrie.
Its highest summit is 80 or 90 feet above the level of the
Isla.  It is composed entirely of that red clay substance,
called mortar here, from its use as a cement in building.
Between the above ridge and the Isla, there is another in-
ferior ridge, which runs a small way parallel to the greater
one; on the S. side of which (former) the church stands.
The inferior rises about 60 feet above the Isla.  It is compo-
sed entirely of gravel, or waterdriven stones and sand.  It is
broken off a small way, and then, in the same parallel line
to the south-westward, an insulated ridge of the same ma-
terials occurs at Couty, which the water of Isla sometimes
nearly forms into an island.  There is besides a good deal
of perfectly level ground, especially near the banks of the
rivers.  This division of the parish westward of the Eroch
is possessed by three proprietors.
