by erecting mounds and bulwarks on the shore, is left
those immediately concerned to determine.

   Climate.-The superior earliness, fertility, and warmth, of
the plains of Morayshire, are facts more certain than easy to
be accounted for.  It is known, that we are in a very northern
latitude.  The mountains of Sutherland and Caithness, seem to
be at too great a distance from us, to afford us shelter from the
north winds, which blow over a great surface of water before
they reach us.  To the E. we are also open to the German
Ocean.  It is true, that we have less rain than elsewhere,
which is said to be accounted for by the flatness of our coun-
ty; but other counties of Scotland, equally flat, have more
rain.  Our surface also inclines to the N., and the only near
hills we have, are those on the S., seemingly more calculated
to overshadow and hurt us, than to give us warmth.  It is said, our
soil is light, and therefore warm:  it is so in many places; but
there are also large districts of deep black earth, and of rank
clay, where the same earliness appears.  After all, were we
merely to consult taste and imagination, in the choice of a resi-
dence, many would prefer what are often to be met with in the
south of Scotland, green hills, with less fertility, and warmth
in the valleys, to our dryer, earlier, and richer plains, with
the prospect of black gloomy hills on the upper landscape.

   Distempers.-Pectoral complaints, rheumatism, and fevers,
are the most frequent diseases.  The king's evil is not uncom-
mon; and of late madness seems to be increasing, even among
the common people.  Upwards of 20 years ago, agues were
frequent near the lake; but were confined to that situation.
None of the sea-faring people are ever seized with agues.
The itch is become much more rare than it was formerly.
It is a truth, which no mere Englishman will readily believe,
