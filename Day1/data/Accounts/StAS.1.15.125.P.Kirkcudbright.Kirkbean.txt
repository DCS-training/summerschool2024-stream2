generally prevail.  Ploughs of this construction are made in
the parish, at 6 L. 6 s. each.  Mr CRAIK has used the same
plough, in sowing all kinds of grain, excepting pulse, for
these 30 years past, and it is still in good repair.  Four oxen,
with two horses, and two men, were formerly used in plow-
ing.  Now, two horses, with one man, who holds the plough,
and drives the horses himself, are found sufficient even for
the heaviest land.

   Rotation of Crops.-Common rotation, two crops of oats,
a green crop, potatoes, beans, pease, or turnips, with a dress-
ing of dung: Then a crop of wheat, or barley, sown out
with rye and clover feeds, to lie 3 or 4 years.  The following
rotation has been tried, but its effect has not yet been fully
ascertained; 1st, oats upon stubble; 2d, horse beans, in rows,
about 20 inches distant, with a full dressing of dung, horse
and hand hoed; 3d, wheat upon one furrow; 4th, turnips,
potatoes, cabbage, etc, horse hoed, on four feet ridges, giving
the crop half a dunging; 5th, barley with red and white clo-
ver seeds, to ly one or two years, and then return to oats.
This rotation is proposed, to make a summer fallow unne-
cessary.  It is suited for a good loamy soil, and where there
is access to lime, marl, or any natural manure.  Where to
these there is no access, there might be difficulty in finding
a sufficient quantity of dung.  There is now no distinction
made between the crost and the out-field.

   Proprietors.-The proprietors are William Craik, Esq; of
Arbigland, Richard Alexander Oswald, Esq; of Auchen-
cruive, Alexander Dickson, Esq; of Ladyland, with James
Duff, William M'Kie, and John Liddle, portioners.  Mr
Craik is the only residing heritor.  Of this gentleman, it is
not easy to say too much, in the opinion of his acquaintance,
or too little, in his own.  For general knowledge, for libe-
