   Sol, Climate, etc.-The soil is in general of a light nature,
and full of stones.  In the lower part of the parish, however,
where improvements are carried on, it appears to be deep
strong loam, producing good crops of corn and grass.  In the
upper part, lime stone is to be got in great abundance from
three different quarries.  But the expence of quarrying and
burning prevents the inhabitans from reaping great benefit
from it.  Some of the more opulent of the tenants drive marle
from the Loch of Kinnordy, about 9 miles distant, which ma-

The healthiness of the people, however, may be ascribed to
their manner of living.  They are not pent up in houses, nor
employed in sedentary occupations like many others, but room

Several instances of longevity are to be found in the parish;
particularly one man in his 94th year, full vigorous and retain-
ing all his faculties, another 82 and a third 76.  During the
summer months, it is very salary, but frost generally set in by
the end of August, and the winters the commonly very severe

   The people, especially in the upper part of the parish, are
hits in beginning to sow, owing principally to the frosts which
keep the ground long, particulary after a severe winter.  It is
often the latter end of March or beginning of April, before
-the seed time is begun.  This, of course, prevents the grain
from nipeting soon; so that it is frequently the middle, and
often the end of November, before the crop is all got in.

   The frost musts do much hurt here, particularly on the river
side.  They seem to man if their noxious quality first on the
potatoe stems.  Some fields of barly have been rendered.
