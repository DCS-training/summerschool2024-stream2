von.  By means of these, the sore ground of this part of the
Ochills, is divided into three separate hills, distinguished by
the names of Wood-hill, Middle-hill, and West-hill of Alva.
On the brow of this last hill, is a very high perpendicular
rock, which, for what reason is not known, has obtained the
name of Craig Leith.  It has been long beyond memory, re-
markable for the residence of that species of hawks, the falcon,
which is used for the diversion of hunting.  One pair, and only
one pair, it is affirmed by the inhabitants of the place, build a
nest on the front of this tremendous rock.  These are said to
hatch their young annually; and, when their peogeny are of
a proper age, the parents force them to seek a new habitation,
till at last, however long they may be supposed to live, the
parents themselves must yield their residence to their survi-

hawk of this breed was thought a valuable acquisition.  They
are still in great request among our own nobility, who love

his skill in that diversion, sent his servant all the way from
Yorkshire, to procure some of this breed.  In order to come
at the nest, he was let down by a rope fastened round his
waist, while the end of it was held fast by ten or twelve peo-
ple, who stood at a convenient distance from the edge of the
precipice; and he was observed scrambling on the face of the
rock, exploring the nest of the bird.
   The house of Alva stands on an eminence, projecting
from the base of the Wood-hill, and near the east end
of the parish.  The height of this projected part of the
hill, is about 220 feet above the water of Devon, which runs
in the valley below.  The hill rises immediately behind the
house, to the height of 1400 feet, making the whole height
