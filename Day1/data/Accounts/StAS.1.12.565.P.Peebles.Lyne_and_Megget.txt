     Of Lyne and Megget.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Though a great part of the
land in Lyne and Megget has been formerly covered with
wood, yet, at present, there are only a few trees around the
church and some of the farm-houses.  The old trees natural-
ly decay through time, and the growth of young ones is ef-
fectually prevented by the sheep and cattle.  In Megget, there
is plenty of moorfowl in good seasons.  The earn, a species
of eagle that builds its nest in a small island in Lochskene,
sometimes carries off a young lamb, even in view of the shep-
herd.  Besides the necessary attention which the flocks of sheep
require, the inhabitants of Megget are mostly employed dur-
ing the summer and autumn in making and carrying home
their peats, in cutting and leading in their hay, and in laying
up provision for the winter.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-At Lyne, the distance
from coals and lime is not great, the roads are good, and there
are 2 convenient bridges over the water.  Thirlage is a griev-

master, is hard on the lower class of people.  Megget labours
under particular disadvantages.  There is no school of any
kind nearer to it, than that of Yarrow, which is 8 or 9 miles
distant.  This want is severely felt, especially by servants
who have large families, who must either send their children
to a great distance for education, or be at the expense of
teaching them at home.  Yet, much to their credit, they are
not inferior in religious knowledge to any of their neigh-
bours.  This must be ascribed chiefly to the diligence and at-
tention of their parents, who are at considerable pains to in-
still into the tender minds of their offspring, the principles of
piety and virtue.  There was indeed the sum of 50 L. Ster-
ling mortified by a former minister of Lyne, and the interest
of it was intended as a salary for a teacher; but, though that
