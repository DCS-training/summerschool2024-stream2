6 or 7 miles; the height of two of them to the north about
1 1/2 mile.  On the top of the north-east hill are plain ves-
tiges of a Roman camp well fortified, with two fosses and
mounds of earth, more than 1 1/2 mile in circuit, with a large
plain near the top of the hill, on which may be seen the
praetorium, or the general's quarter, surrounded with many
huts.  It has all the properties of a well chosen camp, ac-
cording to the rules of Vegetius.  There is a large prospect
from it of all the country; it has many springs of good
water near it; the sides of the hill have been covered with
wood, and the camp is of that extent, that neither man,
beast nor baggage could be straitened for room.  On the
north side of the middle hill, Mr Milne seems to place a
second camp, from which he says is a large ditch for 2
miles to the west, reaching to another camp on the top of
Caldshielhill.  This camp (probably he means, that on the
north side of the middle hill) has been strongly fortified
with a double trench, and the circumvallations of it conti-
nued for a good way.  This camp, with that called Castle-
steed, makes almost a triangle with the large camp on Eil-
don hills.
   To the S. W., of these hills there has been a beautiful
military road, raised in some places high above the ground,
and of a considerable breadth, with military stations in some
places upon it.  In some parts it is carried through lakes and
marshes, and has had a communication with the camp at
Caldshiels, and likewise with another camp on the north
side of the Tweed called the Rink.
   On the head of the hill, on the side of which the village
of Gattonside is founded, north of the Tweed, there has
been a large camp.  It has a wall around it of stone, about
half a mile in compass.  About a mile from this camp
to the east, on the top of the hill, opposite to Newstead,
