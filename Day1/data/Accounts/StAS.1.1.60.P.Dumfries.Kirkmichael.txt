   Woods.-As to timber, besides a pretty large wood of for-
rest trees, with extensive plantations of common firs, pitch
firs, silver firs, laburnums, beeches, oaks, planes, limes, etc.
on the estate of Kirkmichael, there are several of the rarer
species of indigenous trees, the Prunus padus, birds cherry),
Viburnum opulus, (water elder), honeysuckles, bullaces, and
mountain ashes.

   In the barony of Ross there was, till within these last seven
years, an extensive wood, called Knockwood, consisting al-
most wholly of excellent oaks, which was sold by the present
proprietor for about 800 guineas; and, unfortunately, has not
since been properly fenced from the sheep and cattle in the
neighbourhood.

   As to rare plants, of the less useful kinds, there are, in
the parish, the Pyrola rotundifolia, (the winter green), An-
dromeda polifolia, (the marih cistus, or wild rosemary), the
Lichen ventosus, (or storm liverwort), Lichen venosus, (or
veined liverwort), Lichen burgensii, (or crowned liverwort),
with several others.

   The number of black cattle, on an average, are estimated
at between 1000 and 1200; sheep from 8000 to 10,000;
and horses at above 100.  The wild quadrupeds are foxes,
otters, badgers, hares, wild cats, polecats, ermines, and wea-
sels.  As the estate of Kirkmichael abounds both with natu-
ral wood and planting, there is, of course, a considerable va-
riety of birds.  Besides black cocks, moor-fowl, partridges,
plovers, wild ducks, teals, and snipes, there is great plen-
ty of the rarer species of birds, the land and the  water
rails, the quail, the missel thrush, the pine and the common
bulsinch, the wryneck, the golden-crested and the willow
