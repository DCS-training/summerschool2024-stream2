     of Harris.

   It is difficult to describe the form of this parish under one
view, it being composed of seven large inhabited islands, and
a multitude of lesser ones uninhabited, most of which are ir-
regularly interspersed through the Sound of Harris, and the
rest on each side of Harris, properly so called, a peninsula of
Lewis; towards which country it stretches from S. to N. an
immense distance, and exhibits to the view a group of lofty
rugged mountains, oddly huddled together, 'Rudis indigesta-
'que moles.'  Neither is it easy to ascertain the precise extent
of the whole, nor, indeed, of any particular district of it.  We
are not acquainted with any accurate mensuration of distances
taken here, and the computation of the people by miles is at
best uncertain.  In this account, however, we must, for want
of better, adopt it as our rule, allowing (for so we safely may)
every Scotch computed mile to measure 1 1/2-English.  At this
rate, then, the parish of Harris, from the northern to the
southern extremity, along the common track of travelling by
land, and the course of navigation through the Sound, will
be at least 48 miles long: Its breadth varies much.  Near the
northern extremity it is 24 miles; from thence to the Sound,
it may be at an average from 6 to 7; and, of the Sound, na-
vigators calculate the breadth as well as length at 3 leagues.

   Division of Districts.-As the remote and much neglected
quarter of the British Isles, in which this parish is situated,
is, in general, but very imperfectly known to the public at
present; and as it may at some future period assume that im-
portance in the political system, to which its immense extent,
its many natural advantages, and the genius of its inhabitants,
appear to entitle it, the inquisitive reader will readily pardon
in a work of this nature a particularity of description, which,
given of places better known, might justly be deemed super-
fluous and impertinent.  In delineating the topography of a
