them the best food he ever tried for working horses.  The
sheep are so very fond of them, that they may be said to
devour them; and for a week after they were taken off
from them, they did not eat the most succulent grass with
any relish:  they even preferred them to red clover, which,
of all others, used to be reckoned their most favourite
food.

   Lime.-Lime is now universally used as a manure in this
parish; and, after repeated trials, many good farmers seem
disposed to prefer the Charlestown, because they think it
contains sand, which makes it sitter for opening the texture
of clay than the English from Sunderland, especially the
whitest kind, which they think contains chalk*.  The quan-
tity is, in general, 30 bolls South Sunderland lime, barley
measure, and 45 or 50 bolls Charlestown, wheat measure,
per acre, which is laid upon fallow after the dung is plough-
ed in, and then harrowed, to divide and mix it; after which
a very shallow feed-furrow prepares it for sowing.  this
may last for two rotations; that is, twelve years or more,
according to circumstances; but some are of opinion, that
it would be a good practice to give every sallow on clay
about 10 or 12 bolls of lime, harrowed in, in the same man-
ner.  Upon this practice experience must decide.
   In using lime as a manure, many good farmers are of opi-
nion that it ought not to be too much drenched with water,
but laid on as hot as possible, especially in clay, and har-
rowed in immediately, to mix it with the soil:  By which
means, the more complete slacking of the lime would be
left to the succeeding rains, and it would then be more inti-
mately mixed with the soil; and the clay, particularly,

*The greatest fault of the Charlestain lime, is the vast quantities of
Yolks (unburned stones) it contains.  The palion or blue lime, is much
more in request here than any other; expence from 2 s. 4 d. to 2 s. 6 d. per
boll, and about 30 bolls per acre.
