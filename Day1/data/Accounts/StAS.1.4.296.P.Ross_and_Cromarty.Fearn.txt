   Antiquities and Curiosities.-There are several Druidical
temples in this parish.  The abbacy is one of the most an-
cient buildings here.  It is said to have been first made up
of mud.  The principal part of it was 99 feet in length,
within walls, 25 1/2 feet in breadth, and the walls 24 feet
high above the ground.  The abbacy was not only the
place of worship before the Reformation, but ever since,
until October 1742, when, on a sudden, in time of public
worship, the roof fell in.  There were 36 persons killed

which junction there is a stair-case to the top.  The lesser
one, which looks towards the W. being about 20, and the
greater, which looks towards the E. about 38 feet square.
The castle is 60 feet high.  It is fortified with 3 large tur-

the greater.  These turrets are each of them capable of 
holding 3 or more men with ease, and in each of them are
5 small round holes, of about 4 inches diameter, with 3
larger above them, of a quadrangular form.  The latter,
it is imagined, were intended for the sentries or watchmen
