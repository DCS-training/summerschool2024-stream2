     Statistical Account

settled in the parish, principally in the moss.  The Gaelic is
the only language spoken by some of  the inhabitants, and ma-
ny more of them understand it better than the Scotch.
   The names of places are partly of Gaelic original, as Tol-
garth, Gartboch, Arnive, and partly of Scotch, as Bankhead
Westfood*.

   Roads, Bridges.-Great part of the public roads have been
made anew, and bridges built where wanted, within the last 20
years.
   The bridge of Dript over the Forth, on the road to Stir-
ling, is the only considerable one.  It was built by subscrip-
tion.-The others bridges, as also the roads, were executed by
the statute labour, or by allowance from the county fund for
roads and bridges.-Both are now in pretty good condition;
therefore, although the quantity of carriage upon them is in-
creased beyond all comparison, there is good reason the conclude,
that the statute labour, especially if compounded for at an a-
dequate price, will be sufficient to keep them in repair.
   It does not appear that turnpikes would apply well to the
roads of this parish; for if lime for manure was exempted from
toll, the expence of collections would amount to a considera-
ble share of the sum levied.

<FOOTNOTE>

The session generally allow this sum for the funeral of such of the poor as
have been maintained from their fund, if the value of the effects of the deceas-
ed do not fall very much short of it.  And the desire of securing this has in-
duced some, who had a large share of the vices of the begging poor, and who
might otherwise have been clamorous for a high allowance from the parish, to
rest satisfied with such occasional supply as the session thought fit to give
them.

1696.
