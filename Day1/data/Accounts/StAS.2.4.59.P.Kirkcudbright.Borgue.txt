lands of Borgue, and low Carleton, which yield not less than
a third (we believe it might be stated at a half,) more produce
than before the application of this powerful stimulant.
   The farm-steidings and enclosures which, forty years ago, were
of the most miserable description, are now in general good an
sufficient.
   Fences.-Stone walls from five to six feet in height, are the
fences in common use. For c0onstructing these, Borgue enjoys
the advantage of numerous quarries, which yield an abundant sup-
ply of stones of the best description.
   The soil is considered too hard and rocky for planting hedges,
-at the same time, with right management, this useful fence
might be more frequently employed, and would be found service-
able in giving the shelter so much wanted in exposed situations
against the severe gales which are here prevalent.
    Leases.-The land-owners of Borgue, to the hurt of their te-
nants and the injury of their estates, were for some time very
backward in giving leases, and much of the land was let from year
to year. The views of proprietors on this point appear now to be
changed, and the lands of Borgue are let for the most part on
leases varying from fifteen to nineteen years.
   Produce.-The following table furnishes as accurate an ac-
count as can well be given of the amount and value of the gross
produce. We have not the means of coming at the exact truth
on each head.
