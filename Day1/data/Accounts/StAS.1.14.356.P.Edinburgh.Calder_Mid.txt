wheat.  If the barley or oats be not too strong, so as to
prevent the rye-grass and clover from getting the neces-
sary nutriment, which the light and air afford; and if
the soil be good, and properly managed, a luxuriant crop
of hay may be expected, for at least two seasons there-
after; and it is generally fit for mowing 3 years.  And an-
nual kind of rye-grass has lately been introduced into
this neighbourhood, which produces one fine crop; but
being so transient, the farmers are getting quit of it as
fast as they can.  The practice which prevails in England,
of laying dung occasionally on the surface of land, which
is laid down in grass, might be introduced with advan-
tage into this country.  When a grass field, through a
series of years, has acquired a close sward, it is of im-
portance to preserve it as long as the weeds can be kept
down; while the soil is enriched by dung, it may be
kept a long time clean, by the application of lime.  Few
fields of cabbages or carrots are cultivated here, though
the former are reckoned to be good feeding for black
cattle; and the latter, in some parts of England, are
esteemed excellent food for horses.  The root of scarcity,
which is now ascertained to be only a species of the beet,
has, so far as I know, never been reared in this parish.
   The rolling stone is pretty common here.  The ma-
chine, calles Fanners, for cleaning the grain after it has
been thrashed, is much in use among the farmers; but
the thrashing machine, which was invented in Scotland a
few years ago, has not found its way yet into this pa-
rish*.
