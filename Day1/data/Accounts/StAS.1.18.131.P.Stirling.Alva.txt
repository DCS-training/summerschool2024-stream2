est grain.  The tenants begin now to perceive the importance
f fallowing, liming, and cleaning their lands, to obtain good
returns, and the advantage of having broad clover for summer
food for their horses, and being able to work them constantly,
instead of sending them (as they did formerly), to graze for five
months idle on the hills, at a considetable expence.  Any per-
son who has been acquainted with the state of farming in this
parish and its immediate neighbourhood thirty years ago, must
have been led to ascribe the slow progress of improvement, in
a considerable degree, to the very small number of acres, of
which the far greater part of the farms consisted.  The stock of
the farmer, may be considered, as in general, proportioned to
the extent of his farm, which at that time did not commonly ex-
ceed thirty or forty acres.  It was well, if, according to the mode
of culture practised at that time, he could pay his rent, and
provide a mean subsistence for himself and his family.  Ano-
ther circumstance, which affected in a very particular man-
ner the state of farming in this parish, and its neighbour-
hood, was the practice of driving coals from the coal pits on
the south banks of Devon, to the shore of Alloa.  To this
labour, the farmers on the estates where the coals were raised,
were bound by their leaves; and without entering more par-
ticularly into the subject, it must be obvious, how pernicious
the effect of this practice must have been, with respect to the
proper and necessary operations upon the farm.  Such, how-
ever, is the contagion of example, that some of the farmers
in this parish, who were under no obligation to be carriers on
the estate of another proprietor, and excepting during one
very short period, when coal was worked within the parish,
had no occasion to be concerned in it, from ignorance and
unskilfulness respecting their proper employment, and from
the desire of a little gain, earned at the expence of severe
labour to themselves and horses, with the tear and wear of
