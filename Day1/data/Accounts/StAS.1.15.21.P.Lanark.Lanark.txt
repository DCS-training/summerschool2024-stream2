whole body of the river precipitate itself into the chasm
below.  The rock over which it falls is upwards of 12
feet of perpendicular height, from which the Clyde
makes one precipitate tumble, or leap, into a hollow
den; whence some of it again recoils in froth, and smok-
ing mist.  Above, the river exhibits a broad, expanded,
and placid appearance, beautifully environed with plan-
tations of forest trees.  This appearance is suddenly
chanced at the fall: and, below it, the river is narrow,
contracted, and angrily boils and thunders, among rocks
and precipices.
   The same beautiful and romantic walk conducts you
back again, along the precipice that overhangs the river,
both sides of which are environed by mural rocks, equidis-
tant and regular, forming, as Mr Pennart expreses it, a
"stupenduous natural masonry;" from whose crevices
choughs, daws and other wild birds, are incessantly spring-
ing.  You descend along the river for about half a mile,
till you arrive at the Corra Lin. so called from an old cas-
tle and estate upon the opposite bank.  The old castle
of Corra, overhanging a high rock that overlooks the
fall, with Corra house, and the rocky and woody banks
of the Clyde, form of themselves a beautiful and grand
coup d'oeil; but nothing can equal the striking and stu-
penduous appearance of the fall itself, which when view-
ed from any of the different seats placed here and there
along the walks, must fill every unaccustomed beholder
with awe and astonishment.  The tremenduous rocks a-
round, the old castle upon the opposite bank, a corn mill
in the rock below, the turious and impatient stream foam-
ing over the rock, the horrid chasm and abyss underneath
your feet, heightened by the hollow murmur of the wa-
ter and the screams of wild birds, form at once a spectacle
