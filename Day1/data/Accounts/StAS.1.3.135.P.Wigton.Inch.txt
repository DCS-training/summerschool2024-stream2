land.  Their tops, for some miles, are covered with heath, till
you descend on the other side to the water of Luce, where
there is excellent pasture, and good arable ground.  This
water divides the parish from Newluce; discharges itself into
Luce bay; and abounds with salmon.

   Soil and Produce.-The soil of Inch is various.  Near
Stranraer, there is a good loam.  The rest of the parish con-
sists chiefly of a light sandy soil.  The hills abound in moss.
By the influence and example of the late Earl of Stair, the
Inch has undergone a total alteration.  It is but justice to re-
mark, that this noble and worthy personage, was the great
promoter of impovement in this part of the country.  As
he possessed skill and ability, so he acted on an extensive
scale.  He procured proper implements of husbandry,-
paired and burnt mossy grounds,-divided and inclosed his
lands,-drained swamps and marshes,-made excellent roads,
-tore up large tracks of barrin ground,-and import-
ed lime in great quatities both from England and Ire-
land.  Hence what formerly produced only heath, soon
yielded rich crops of corn.  The people beheld the benefi-
cial effects of his meliorations.  They were roused from in-
dolence and inactivity.  Ignorance and idleness soon vanish-
ed, and labour and industry occupied their place.  As a
specimen of the excellent effects of his Lordship's improve-
ments, a farm which, preceding 1790, was let for the sum of
L. 7: 2: 6, now rents at L. 195; and another, previous to
the same date, was rented at L. 48: 4: 8, and is now let at
L. 245.  The same nobleman found his estate in this parish,
not only in a great measure barren, but also naked.  He
therefore clothed and adorned it with large plantations of
trees.  During the space of twenty years, he planted annual-
ly, at an average, at least 20,000 trees, chiefly Scots firs,
