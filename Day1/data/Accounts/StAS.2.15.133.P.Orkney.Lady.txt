                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        Situation, &c.-LADY parish is situate on the east side of the
   Island of Sanday, and is about nine miles long by one mile broad.
   It is bounded on the north, east, and south, by the sea; and on the
   west, partly by Cross parish, and partly by the sea, forming the
   large bay and harbour of Otterswick.  The parish takes its name
   from the church called Lady Kirk, or the Kirk of our Lady, evi-
   dently dedicated in Catholic times to the Virgin Mary.  It con-
   sists of several districts or subdivisions, as follows: Elsness, Over-
   bister, Coligarth, Tressness, Neivark, Selibister, Northwall.
   Each of these districts was probably, in ancient times, a separate
   distinct parish.
      Meteorology.-I subjoin a statement of the average heat of the
   weather for the greater part of two years.

      On the estate of Elsness, there is an oyce or inlet of the sea,
   from which the water wholly retreats, during the ebb tide-con-
   taining 100 Scotch acres.  The entry is narrow, but of suffi-
   cient depth of water for sloops of any size; and the whole oyce
   might easily be converted into a harbour.  At present, there is a
   rock or bar near the mouth, which, with ordinary floods, renders
