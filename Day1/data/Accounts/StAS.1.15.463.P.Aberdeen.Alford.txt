to remain five.  In the summer, sheep are turned out to the
hill, to range at their own discretion, and, at night-fall, a boy
is sent to drive them down to the folds, from which they are
frequently not released till the morning is far gone.
   As we have no shepherds, nor even good sheep dogs, so them
are no divisions of the slocks, according to their sexes, or ages,
nor any ground hained for winter.  In this season, they are
turned out upon the arable lands of the farm, which have
not been in corn crop; and seldom sent to the hill, unless the
weather is very mild; but during storms and falls of snow,
their subsistence must depend upon heath broom, or any
thing else, which can be reached by scraping.  No salve or
smearing is used in this county; and if a farmer's stock is not
very numerous, the sheep are crammed into small houses,
built for the purpose, during the night, and what with the
alternate heat and cold they thus undergo, and the poor
fcanty feeding of this season, they are in spring reduced to a
very lean weakly state, which it requires a considerable part
of the summer to restore.  The grounds, however, are heal-
thy, and no very mortal or difficult diseases prevail among
the slocks on account of the pasture.  The improper burning
of heath grounds has been highly detrimental to sheep in
this country; for the farmers never consult the proper situa-
tion of the place in regard to shelter, the nature of the soil,
and the favourableness of the season for this purpose; nor do
they herd the burnt ground, to preserve the tender grass,
which springs up, from being plucked out at the roots, by the

#In deep snows, the country people uncover the heath with spades, to
enable the sheep to pluck it.  Farther up the Don, in the country called
Strathdon, which is more stormy, but where they have many more, and
much better sheep than here, this is a common practice, There, likewise, the
farmers cut off the heath, when it is in flower; and alter drying them, 107
them up for winter provision.
