   			III.-POPULATION.
	For the reasons above assigned, it is impossible now, with
   any accuracy, to ascertain the ancient state of the population
   of this parish, which would appear to have been subject to consi-
   derable fluctuation, both in circumstances and numerical amount.
	The amount of the population since the commencement of the
   Parliamentary census has been as follows :

   <TABLE>
                                         Males.      Females.
                In 1801 it was    1418    619          799
                   1811           1500    647          853
                   1821           2031    930         1101
                   1831           2139    980         1159

 	This gradual increase of population is satisfactorily accounted
   for by the growing habits of attention to cleanliness and health,
   apparent among the people,-the universal use of vaccination,-and
   the occasional influx of strangers, particularly the settlement here
   of the staff of the Ross-shire militia in 1816. The increase since
   1821, as indicated above, is considerably less than it would have
   been, owing to the extent to which emigration has been carried on
   during the last few years;-the average number of persons who
   have left this parish for the Canadas, during that period, being not
   much below twenty, annually. A considerable number also of
   young men leave this parish yearly, in quest of employment in the
   south.
         The number of the population residing in the burgh is 1715, be-
   ing about four-fifths of the whole. There are no villages in the parish.

   The Yearly average of births for the last seven years is                         50
   That of marriages for the same period                                            11 4/7
   There is no register of deaths kept in the parish.

      parish is about                                                               15
   The number of proprietors of land, of the yearly value of L.50 and upwards, is    7

   	The people of this parish are not remarkable for any peculiarity
   in their personal appearance.
   	The number of insane persons is 2 ; of fatuous 6 ; of blind 1;
   and of deaf and dumb 1.
	Gaelic is still the language of the lower orders of the people,
   although it has been sensibly declining within the last twenty
   years, and promises at no very distant period to be completely sup-
   planted by the English, which is understood by all, and tolerably
