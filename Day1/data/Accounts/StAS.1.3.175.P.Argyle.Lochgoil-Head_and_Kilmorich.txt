the swallow, cuckoo, fieldfare, doterel, green and gray plo-
ver, and woodcock.  With regard to native birds, the eagles
of this country are of a prodigious size, amd remarkable for
their strength and ferocity.  They make great havock among
the lambs in the end of spring, when, in addition to the cra-
vings of their own hunger, they are impelled to rapine, by
the cries of their young.  There are several instances well
vouched, of an eagle's carrying a lamb, whole and entire in
the air, more than a mile, and bringing it to her nest.  Two
years ago, one of these birds carried a kid away from its
dam, upwards of a mile, and after lighting with it upon the
ground, on being scared away, by people who were coming
that way, it was found, not only that the kid was alive, but
that it had received no material injury; the kid was five
weeks old.  The hawk is next to the eagle in ferocity; but
it does no injury to cattle.  The raven is not so harmless;
kites, crows, and rooks, are in great abundance; and the
harsh amd melancholy note of the owl, sometimes disturbs
the silence of the night.  This country has all the small
birds which are common in the west of Scotland.  Birds of
game are not so numerous as they were  before the intro-
duction of sheep; these animals break their eggs, crop the
tender part of the herbage, and of the heath, upon which
they feed while young; birds of prey, however, do more
injury to game, than even the sheep; and gentlemen of
landed property, by their anxiety to preserve the game,
seem to defeat their own purpose.  They have in effect dif-
armed the country people; the consequence is, that birds of
prey of all kinds, are becoming more numerous, and these
birds do a great deal more injury to the game, than poachers
could possibly do in such a country as this.  The tarmagan
is sometimes seen in the mountains.  Grouse, heathfowl, par-
tridges, quails, and snipes, are to be found in their different
