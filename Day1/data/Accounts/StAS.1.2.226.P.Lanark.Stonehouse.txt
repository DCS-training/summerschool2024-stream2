to have been, at that time, 872 souls in the parish: of these
272 resided in the village, and 600 in the country.  The re-

out by the present minister in November last, there were
found to be 1060; of whom 593 resided in the village, and
467 in the country.  The village consequently has increased

crease, on the whole, in the last 40 years, is 237.  Of the a-
bove 1060, there are,
