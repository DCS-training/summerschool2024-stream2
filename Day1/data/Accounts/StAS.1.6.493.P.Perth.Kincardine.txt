dently of the same nature, and have had the same origin.-
Kincardine moss is wholly in this parish.  About 25 years a-
go, it consisted of 1800 acres.  Flanders moss is more than
three times that extent.  Part is in this parish, and part in the
parishes of Kilmadock, Kippen, and Port.-The mosses are
evidently superinduced over the soil of the Carse; being so
much above it as their own thickness; they are therefore not
liable to be flooded by water, and, as there is only one spring
discovered in them, the wetness is owing wholly to the quali-
ties of the moss or bog-earth.-All these have been consi-
dered as capable of improvement, but any progress made in
reclaiming them was so slow, that a person of great property
has, within these last 20 years, expressed frequently his wish,
that the first, at least, had rather been a piece of water.-
They are now, however, in higher estimation, in consequence
of the improvements that have been made, particularly
on that of Kincardine.-There were different methods in
use formerly for improving the moss, which in general were 
confined to the spread-field, that is, the waste moss, which
being unfit for peat, had been cast behind the peat cutters, and
its surface being smoothed, and drains cut in it, the peats
were laid upon it to be dried.-It was already drained so far
as to bear cattle in dry weather.  Some persons ploughed, and
when it became dry, set fire to it.  By repeating this opera-
tion, as often as their convenience or the season permitted,
such a quantity of ashes was procured, as being incorporated
with the remaining bog-earth, produced a coarse grass.-
Where the moss was thin, it was sometimes consumed so far
by this operation, that the plough might reach the clay, in
this case the moss was said to be gained, i. e. made arable.-
Where the moss was too thick to be gained by ploughing and
burning, it was a common practice to carry part to the con-
tiguous ground, which, being exhausted by producing several
