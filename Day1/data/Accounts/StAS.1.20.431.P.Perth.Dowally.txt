in the town, but many also in the country.  They purchase,
too, a great proportion of the linen which is brought from
the neighbourhood to the Stamp-Office here.  The report
of the stamp-master to the Board of Trustees, for a course of
years preceding the last, will shew the progress and present
state of the manufacture in that quarter.

   3. Tanning.-There are tanned here annually, at an ave-
rage, of horse skins, 220; and of sheeps, 2100.  The situa-
tion is favourable for the manufacture.  Oak-bark is near,
and, comparatively with its price in places more distant,
cheap.  Some years ago it was bought at 8d. per stone; it
costs now 1 s. 3 d.  Birch-bark has been sometimes em-
ployed as a substitute, but is found to be much weaker in
its effects.  It fells at half the price of the oak-bark.

*The increase of trade in Dunkeld, for the last 12 years, may be infer-
red from the increase of the Post-Office revenue.  For the year 1786, it was
L. 138: 16: 4;  and for the year ending 5th January 1798, it was L. 279,
11 s. 1 d.; an increase (allowing for the additional rate of postage lately
imposed) of L. 50 at least per annum.
