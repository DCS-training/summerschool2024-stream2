very uncertain security.  The road was accordingly soon
made in the completest manner; and these gentlemen have
now the satisfaction of having conferred a lasting advantage
on the country; while, from the increase of the manu-
factures of Glasgow, and the number of travellers, the turn-
pike duties have repaid thei advance of money.  As these du-
ties are now perfectly sufficient to support the road, independ-

roads in the parish, which, owing to the good management
of a residing heritor, who takes charge of the application,
are all likewise in good order.  The statute money of the 
parish amounts to L. 63:6:8 Sterling yearly, and is upon
the increase.  It is raised by an assessment of 18 s. Sterling
upon each L. 100 Scotch of valued rent, and of 2 s. Sterling
upon each householder.  Good roads should be the first ob-
ject of improvement in every country.  It is to their being
so good in this parish, that a great part of its prosperity
may be ascribed.

   Ferry.-The ferry of Erskine, almost opposite to the
church, is the communication for foot passengers, horses,

The quays have lately been removed to more proper situa-

   Church.-The church is a very ancient building, and was
formerly a branch of the abbacy of Paisley.  The stipend
is 89 bolls 2 sirlots 1 peck 2 lippies of meal, and L. 45,
13 s. 4 d. Sterling of money, including L. 4:3:4 Sterling
for furnishing communion elements.  The manse is plea-
sant and commodious; and, since an exchange with the fa-
mily of Blantyre, who very liberally made a considerable
addition to the glebe, it is now a very good one, consisting
