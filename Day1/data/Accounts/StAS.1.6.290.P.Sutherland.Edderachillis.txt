frequented by shipping, any necessaries the place itself cannot
supply are easier got than in most parts of the kingdom.

   Harbours, Fishery, etc.-What Edderachylis had been, and
still is, happy in, far beyond other parts of the Highlands, is
the fishing upon its coast, and its many excellent bays and har-
bours, where shipping og all sizes can enter, and moor close
to the land, at all hours of the day and night, in perfect safe-

harbour are quite full of herrings; and sometimes they remain
off and on the coast to about Christmas; at other times, they
leave the bays all at once in September, and no more is seen
of them that year.-Haddocks are killed on this coast also,
and in some years in great numbers, and they are commonly
