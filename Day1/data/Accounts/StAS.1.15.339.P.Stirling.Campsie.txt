times the sum of what they were in 1745; even so late as
1760, four pounds Scots was the rent of a cottage with a small
yard annexed to it; such houses rent now at twenty shillings
but, from the improvement made on cot-houses, the rent of
a room and kitchen, or what in the language of the place is

and lime, together with that of tim cot-houses, be added to
the land, the total rent of the parish may be stated to be eight
thousand four hundred pounds Sterling per annum.

few acres of land, anti who principally employ themselves as
masons, or carriers, or road makers; there is another distinc-
tion to be made of these heads of families, who employ them-
selves in agriculture; 28 of them are feuers, who farm their
