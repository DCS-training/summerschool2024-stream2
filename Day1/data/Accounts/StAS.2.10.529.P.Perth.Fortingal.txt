            maiden or queen of the m  fairies.  Viewingthis,loftym-ountain,fromtlie
            north-west, it appears of a conical 1 figure.-but from the,south' and
            east, it is the very reverse. It rests. upon a long narrow base, ris-
            ing from the east end with a gentle acclivity, the west end, and.,
            both sides being very steep, and here and there covered with a
            surface of stones; but it is marked on the whole with fewer inequa-
            lities from base to top, than perhaps any mountain
            tude in the Highlands of Perthshire.
               The height of the mountains within or connected with the pa-
            rish, above the level of the sea, may be reckoned nearly as follows;
            but perfect -accuracy is'not to be expected.

            Besides these, there are many other mountains of considerable
            magnitude, interpersed here and there, which have the effect of
            diversifying the character of the scene. From the top of the hill
            of Comrie, head of Rannoch, there is a very grand and extensive
            prospect. A spectator finds himself situated in the centre of a
            vast amphitheatre, 40 miles by 20. The river Gauir meanders by,
            and Loch-Rannoch, 12 miles long, with its bosky banks, expands
            below. Of this vast and picturesque amphitheatre, the range of
            mountains which intersects the parish from east to west, and the
            mountains of Glenorchy form the south side-the rugged peaks of
            the "Black mount" and Buachaille Eitibh, the west,- the moun-
            tains of Lochaber and Badenoch, the north-west and north; -and
            on the east "Sith-chaillin" and "Beinn-a-chualaich" upon opposite
            sides,- rear their summits like vast pillars, as if to guard the only
            seeming ingress to the grand expanse.
               Valleys-Glenlyon.-This district or valley extends in a westerly
            direction from the head of Fortingal, to near the stage-house of Tyn-
            drum, upon the western military road,- a distance of from 32 to
            35 miles. A considerable part of the head of the glen is now
            but thinly peopled, being occupied by extensive sheep-graziers,
            one of whom possesses a tract of upwards of 15 miles in length,
            and numbers above 8000 sheep. The glen is very narrow; what
            may be termed its general level ground by the river's side, being
            seldom above a furlong broad; and the mountains often encroaching
            so far from opposite sides, as even in some places to confine the
