	Habits and Character of the People.--The people, on the whole,
are sober and well-disposed. They enjoy in a more than ordi-
nary degree the comforts and advantages of society, fearing God
and honouring the king. The immoral part of the community is
wonderfully small, considering the populousness of the village, and
the temptations to which they are consequently exposed.

			   IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture and Rural Economy.--The soil of this parish (as
has been already remarked) is generally very productive, even by
nature. It has been well called the garden of Annandale; but
besides this it has more of the advantages which good farming
bestows than most of the parishes in this county. The larger
proprietors have lately adopted the system of throwing several
small farms into one of great extent and high rental, thus se-
curing men of considerable capital for their tenants, and conse-
quently conducinf to the ultimate improvement and increased
value of the land. The following table will give a pretty correct
view of the agricultural concerns of this parish:

The number of acres cultivated,                                 5143

<FOOTNOTE>Of the uncultivated land, the hill of Burnswark constitutes the greater part, and
it is almost entirely used for grazing sheep.
