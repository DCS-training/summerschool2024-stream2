vourable, and conclude the making of their barley sowing 
about the 25th of May.  Harvest commonly begins, in the
low part of the parish, the first or second week of Septem-
ber, and in the hills extends to the end of October or be-
ginning of November.
   There is only a small quantity of ground occupied by
woods and rivers, and none at all by forest, lakes or mar-
shes.  There are a few hundred acres in common on the 
west end of the village of Auchterarder, called the moor
of Auchterarder, to which the cows of the inhabitants go
to pasture.  In its state it is of no great value;
were it improved, and the southern part especially is very
capable of improvement, the value of it would be vastly
increased.  There are also several hundred acres upon the
hill of Fosswell (part of the Ochils) in common among the
neughbouring seuars: Both commons may parhaps contain
12 or 14 hundred acres.  Very little land lets above, or e-
ven at 20 s. the acre, except in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the town.  Marl has been found in different parts 
of the parish but as the parcels hitherto discovered have
been in no great qauntity, they are already exhausted.

   Advantages and Disadvantage.-The parish has a pe-
culiar advantage in the small river of Ruthven, which runs
through it from one end to other; and at all seasons of
the year, conveys such quantity of water, as is sufficient
to turn the machinery of any ordinary mill.  Besides four
corn-mills, there are already erected on it, three lint mills,
two oil-mills, a paper and a fulling mill; and, with little
expence any kind of mill might be erected on it, which
does not require a great weight of water.  It is perhaps also
an advantage to the parish, that the direct road runs through
it, which leads from Perth, Aberdeen, and the East country,
to Stirling and Glasgow.
