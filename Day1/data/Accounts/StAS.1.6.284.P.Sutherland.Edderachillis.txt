deed, are numerous, and very destructive, and not easily de-

which the ruggerness of the country affords them; eagles, and
other ravenous birds, destroy many lambs; but by diligent ex-
ertions persisted in, this country might be, in time, cleared of
all those nexious creatures.  Nay, it is more than probable,

annexing sit parts of his deer forest to the nearest and most pro-

and other places, travel through the country, and buy what
