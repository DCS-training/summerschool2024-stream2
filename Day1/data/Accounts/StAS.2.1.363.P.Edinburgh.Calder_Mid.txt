in the Torphichen charter-chest, which further demonstrates the
affluence and consideration of this family in ancient times.  Among
other documents in the possession of the family, there is one of
1384, whereby King Robert II, who was then at Calder House,
attended by his court, remits "dilecto filio nostro Jacobo de San-
dylandis militi, et Johanne sponsae suae, filiae nostrae karrissimae,
and to their lawful heirs, in perpetuum, the feudal casualty pro
Castriwarda Baroniae de Caldoure," and by another original do-
cument, dated 7th February 1404, James Sandilands, the ances-
tor of this family, is styled the king's nephew, his mother, the
princess Johanna, being the sitter of Robert III.  The former Sir
James, in right of his mother, Elionora, only sister of William, first
Earl of Douglas, became heir general of the Douglasses.  Be-
tween her and her first husband, the Earl of Carrick, there was
no surviving issue, so that at the death of the children of the above
Earl William without issue, his immediate line became extinct;
and, as James Sandilands, by his wife, Elionora, the only sister of
Earl William, had a son James, this son became heir-at- law, and,
heir of all the family estates destined to heirs general.  The noble
family of Torphichen thus became heirs-general, as they still are,
of this distinguished House of Douglas, whose arms they have in-
variably borne in memorv of their descent.  The arms of Sandi-
lands, together with the chief insignia of Douglas, are repeatedly
sculptured, in the fifteenth century upon the ancient parts of the
church of Calder, and, in one instance, with angels for supporters
which likewise marks their connection with the Knights of St John
of Jerusalem, as may be seen from inspection of the Great Seal
of the Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, as sculptured in 719,
on which are angels for supporters.  From another original docu-
ment it appears, that Isabel, Countess of Mar, who was heir-at-
law of the House of Douglas, had obtained possession of the ba-
rony of Cavers, with some other lands, but that James Sandilands,
by a deed of King Robert III., endeavoured to prevent her from
alienating the said barony, which was a very important and valu-
able portion of the Douglas inheritance; yet, notwithstanding this
deed, in which the king styles him "dilecto nepoti meo," and in
which the king makes a solemn promise not to permit any part of
this land to be alienated, it was rendered ineffectual by the supe-
rior power and influence of the Douglases.  Being anxious to se-
cure the great interests thus vested in the Laird of Calder, in re-
