finding some life in him, (they) did thrust several durks and skenes
in him, and at last did cut his throat with a long durk."-" And
to manifest their further cruelty, they did cast some of the afore-
said persons into holes made for them, who were spurning and
wrestling, whilst they were suffocated with earth; having denied
to them any time to recommend themselves to God, albeit ear-
nestly desired and begged by the said murdered persons. Inso-
much that the Lord from heaven did declare His wrath and dis-
pleasure against the foresaid inhuman cruelty, by striking the tree
whereon they were hanged in the said month of June, being a
lively, fresh growing ash-tree at the kirk-yard of Denoone, among
many other fresh trees with leaves,-the Lord struck the said tree
immediately thereafter; so that the whole leaves fell from it, and
the tree withered, never bearing leaves thereafter, remaining so
for the space of two years, which, being cut down, there sprang
out of the very heart of the root thereof a spring like unto blood,

the times, and in the circumstances in which it was drawn up,
should exaggerate, cannot be doubted.  But it is evident that too
much of it must have been matter of fact, and is to be viewed, and
happily, as the last outbreak of fierce misrule, occasioned perhaps
by a long course of mutual provocations between a party, the La-
months, who considered themselves the original possessors of the
territory, and another party, the Campbells, who, it is historically
evident, had been obtaining the ascendency in the district, ever
since the transference of its lordship from the hands of the Stew-
ards to those of the house of Argyle.  It does not appear that
Dunoon Castle was ever inhabited after this period, but was al-
lowed to fall into decay.
   The old Castle of Toward, the residence of the chief of the
Lamonts, or at least of some principal cadet of the family, desig-
nated in the indictment now cited as the house of Sir James
Lamond, is a ruin, apparently of no earlier date, as a building,
than the fourteenth or fifteenth century, of the style common to that
age.  It does not appear to have been inhabited at any time sub-
