was converted some years ago by act of Parliament.  The
bridges are kept in excellent order.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church was rebuilt in 1766, when
it was removed about half a mile westward from its former
situation in Kirkurd policy.  Around it there is a piece of
ground appropriated for burying; but though this burial-
ground has been now opened for upwards of 20 years, the
old church-yard, for various reasons, is still very much used.
The stipend, with the addition of a manse, and a glebe of
19 acres, will amount to upwards of 80 L. Sterling.  The
manse, offices, and glebe, which were formerly at a consider-
able distance from both kirks, are now in the neighbourhood
of the new.  The manse and offices were all new built in
1788.  The greatest part of the new glebe (which was ex-
cambed for the old) has been inclosed by the minister, at his
own expence, with hedge and ditch.  John Carmichael, Esq;
of Skirling is patron.

   Poor.-As there are no rates, the poor are supported from
the weekly collections in the church, by dues at proclamations
for marriage, by dues for mort-cloths, and the interest of a
capital of 140 L. at 5 per cent.
