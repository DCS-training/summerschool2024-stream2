carts, rude and simple as they were at that time, were foolish
enough to join the farmers in their neighbourhood, and em-
ploy themselves during a considerable part of the summer, in
carrying the great coal to the port of Alloa.  They were at
last however, wisely prohibited by Lord Alva, the late pro-
prietor of this barony, from following this absurd and un-
profitable occupation; indeed when they began to acquire a
taste for improving their farms, and to reap the benefit of
their improvements, they were soon convinced of the inu-
tility of their ancient practice; and very probably would have
abandoned it of their own accord.  The extent of the farms
has been, within the last twenty years, considerably enlarged;
the consequence of which has been, that besides imitating the
example of the gradual improvements in agriculture, the far-
mer has been enabled to make a more respectable appearance
than formerly.  It is evident from the writings of those, who
hav treated of the subject of agriculture, that it has been
considered as a difficult problem, to slate the just and reason-
able extent of a farm, or to fix the number of acres, that one
farm should contain; and from the different options which
have been given, it may be inferred, that perhaps no general
rule can be laid down.  A g neral observation however, may
be offered; that the farm should at least be so extensive, that
the profits of the stock employed in cultivating it, should
enable the farmer to live decently and comfortably, and in a
manner above the other country tradesmen who surround
him.  In a small farm of 40, or even 50 acres, allowing it to
be as productive as can be supposed, and the rent moderate;
still the profits arising to the farmer, cannot possibly be so
great, as to raise his state much above that of the lower class
of manufacturers, who inhabit country parishes.  According
to the division of farms that has hitherto taken place in this
parish, which has been from 30 to 60, or not more than 70
