     of Glenquaich, Appin, Foss, and Fincastle, each strath having its
     own respective river flowing gently or rapidly along ; and its sides
     interspersed with cultivated, and in many places wooded braes,
     waving downwards in rich luxuriance to the plain below, or inter-
     sected by occasional deep and romantic ravines, through which the
     mountain torrents force their turbulent way to the principal and
     more gentle streams in the lower vales.
        Lying among the Grampians, and consisting, as we have said,
     of hill and date, this parish comprehends scenery of every class of
     excellence, from the sublime and picturesque to the beautiful and
     comparatively champaign.  By far the finest of its vales is Appin,
     of which Strathtay and Grandtully form a contintation.
        Some of the hilly ridges above-mentioned rise gradually from
     the base, others abruptly, with majestic boldness ; some are of a
     conical, others of an elliptical shape, while the whole is everywhere
     divided by deep gullys formed by innumerable brooks, or inter-
     spersed with swelling eminences, fine mossy levels, and sloping
     open dales, yielding pasture for numerous flocks of sheep and
     herds of cattle, as well as shelter and sustenance for game.  The
     highest of these ridges is the middle one, rising from the vale of
     Appin towards the north, and separating it from that of Foss ; and
     the most elevated points within its range are, Schiehallion, partly
     in the parish of Fortingall, and Farragon, wholly in this parish,--
     the former rising to an elevation of 3,513, and the latter to 2,535
     feet above the level of the sea, from whose lofty summits the pro-
     spect, on a clear day, is various and extensive, though rather of a
     wild and mountainous character.  The most imposing and pictu-
     resque view, however, in the whole parish, is from the top of the
     rock of Dull, immediately behind the manse.  From this eminence,
     the eye of the spectator is gratified with every thing beautiful and
     sublime,--woods, waters, hills, edifices, and fertile fields.  Imme-
     diately to the west is seen the contracted but rich vale of Fortin-
     gall, with its green sloping hills; to the south-west appears Loch-
     tay, as far as the promontory of Acharn, reclining in calm repose;
     the Bridge of Kenmore spanning the pellucid and new-born stream,
     with its church nestling among the neighbouring trees; and a, little
     nearer the princely mansion of Taymouth, with, its noble-wooded
     environs luxuriantly blooming with ever-varying vegetation ; to the
     east, again, the eye surveys Strathtay with its inclined banks taste-
     fully adorned with variegated plantations ; and beyond it the Braes
     of Tullymet and St Columba's farm are seen clasically diversify-
