   Population.-In Dr Webster's list in 1755, the numbers
were rated at 858 In the year 1764, the whole population
amounted to 680 souls, of which the Ferry-town of Cree
(now Creetown) then contained 104.  As the country part
of the parish has altered very little in point of population,
since that period, it will be necessary to show the increase
that has been in Creetown at all the different periods since
that time.

   Causes of Population.-The increase of population, not on-
ly in this place, but also in many other places in Scotland,
is principally owing to these three following causes:
   1. To the beneficial effects of inoculation for the small-
pox, by which the lives of numbers of children are preserv-
ed; and, general as the practice is become, yet, still there are
many of there little innocents, that fall victims to the inat-
tention, stupidity, and superstition of their parents, who are
so wedded to their ancient prejudices, that rather than part
with them, they will consign over half-a-dozen fine children
to the ravages of this terrible disorder, or, perhaps, to the
gloomy mansions of the tomb.
