cessful improvement here described, well deserves to be gene-
rally known and pursued.  Whatever advantage accrues from
it to the proprietor is meritoriously obtained: as by this
practice, the produce of the country in corn and cattle is en-

the lowest of the people not only find beneficial employment,
but it affords motives to excite them to the exertion of the
most vigorous and useful industry.
   A large number of the settlers in the moss of Kincardine

America: which without this, or some other effectual re-
medy, will not be prevented.
   This extraordinary piece of improvement took its rise from
the inventive genius and patriotic views of the late Lord
Kames; and has been conducted and brought to perfection
by his son, in a liberal and judicious manner.  But though
it had no precedent, it is surprising that, from the experience
of its utility, it should not as yet have been followed as an
example by any other proprietor.  In Moss Flanders, which
is adjacent, there are near 10,000 acres perfectly similar,
but which have greater advantages with respect to water than
the moss of Kincardine.
   It is urged by some landholders, who have extensive mos-
