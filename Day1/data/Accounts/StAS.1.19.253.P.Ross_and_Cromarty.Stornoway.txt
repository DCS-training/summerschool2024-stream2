     of Stornoway.

   Remarkable Instance of Preservation.-Eight years ago, a
father and child, (a girl about eight years of age), going
from stornoway across the moor, in company with several
others, the father having forgot to execute some part of his
business in the town, hastily returned, and, committed the
care of his child to those in company with her, till he would
overtake them; the child inadvertently falling behind, was
not missed, till the travellers had proceeded far on their
way, and the father had overtaken them; who as soon as
he found that his child was not in company, instantly
flew away like one distracted in quest of her, and with all
the pangs of paternal sorrow, returned again to Stornoway,
late at night, weary and disappointed.  Next day, many
people went far and near in search of her, through deep
snow, and a trackless moor, repeating their diligence and
minutest scrutiny for several days successively without ef-
fect.  When they had utterly despaired to find her, (in-
conceivable to believe it!) on the eighteenth day after she
was lost, the helpless and unwary wanderer was, by a man
and dog, found near the sea-side, alive and in motion, but
so faint and exhausted by cold and hunger, that she could
not walk.  She was carried to the town, humanely re-
ceived, and all necessary means used to restore her almost
expiring life to health and strength.  She was too young to
give any distinct account of the manner in which she was
enabled to subsist so long without food and shelter from the
cold.  She is now in the service of Mrs Mackenzie of Sea-
forth, at Seaforth Lodge, who has been remarkably kind
to her from the time of the above accident.

   Wood.-Here no woods grow to any useful height or
size.  The proprietor, some years ago, planted a variety of
trees in a well sheltered spot of ground near his house, which
