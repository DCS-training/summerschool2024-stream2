winkles, besides, have of late been sent to the London market to
good account.  There is also abundance of shrimps to be found, but
they have never been fished for to any extent.
  The rent of the salmon-fisbing in the river (Lord Fife, proprie-
tor,) is L. 1600 a year.  There are also bag-net fishings in the
sea on each side of the river's mouth.  That on the east side is
Lord Fife's, and included in one tack with the river fishing.  That
on the west side is let by the town of Banff for L. 191 yearly; but
their right is called in question by Lord Fife, and at present the
subject of litigation.
  The salmon are sent by steam, either pickled or packed in icd,
principally to the London market.
  The herring fishery on the east coast of Scotland was for many
years almost exclusively confined to the coast of Caithness and
Sutherland; but about the year 1815, owing to the encouragement
given by Government in the shape of bounties, together with the
assistance of well qualified persons to superintend the cure and
brand the herring barrels, the fishing of herrings was commenced
on the coasts of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Moraysbire, and Ross-
hire.  It was soon discovered that the herrings were of as good
quality on the south side of the Murray Frith as on the north,
and equally abundant; and this trade, from a very small beginning,
has grown to be flourishing and extensive; and, though the boun-
ties have been withdrawn, the herring fishery is still carried on
with great spirit.
  The quantity cured in the district of the Banff Fishery Officer,
which extends from Gardenstown to Portsoy, in favourable seasons,
is about 30,000 barrels.  Of this quantity, nearly one-half is ex-
ported to Germany ; a considerable part is sent to London for the
supply of the West India islands, and the remainder goes general-
ly to Ireland.  The following table exhibits the state of the herring
fishery, as regards the port of Banff alone, for the last five years.

    About the year 1819, the number of  herring boats from the
port of Banff was perhaps not short of 170.  The decrease lat-
terly I have never heard accounted for in any way that does not
mainly resolve into mere matter of chance, or otherwise, by refe-
rence to some of those unaccountable prejudices and superstitions
