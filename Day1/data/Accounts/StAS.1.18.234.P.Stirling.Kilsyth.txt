and is covered with a deep hank of blaes, from 10 to 30
feet thick, and without a proper roof, it can never be min-
ed, nor even removed without considerable expence.
   In a variety of other places, there are favourable appear-
ances of lime; especially in the east barony.  Near the cen-
tre of it, at a farm called Berry-hill, there are several strata
of lime, which have been wrought to advantage.  But it is
much more sandy, and contains less calcareous earth; and is
in every respect, of a coarser quality.  Yet, as there is a
good roof, and, as it may at all times be wrought level free;
as it consists of several strata, of above 6 or 8 inches thick,
with interstices of clay about the same thickness; and as it is
divided into small square wedges by perpendicular fissures, it
is wrought with ease and little expence; seldom or never re-
quiring the force of powder.  But the road to it is steep,
and in bad repair; therefore the demand for it has not been
great, except from the immediate neighbourhood.
   I suppose however, that there may be at least 1500, if not
1800 chalders annually thrown out from the three posts put
together.
   Besides these, which have all been turned to account, there
is about a quarter of a mile above West-side, a vein of copper,
which was wrought about 60 or 70 years ago, by order of
the York building company.  Of this, I could not have given
any distinct account; unless it had been examined by the in-
genious Mr Raspe, in the year 1791.  As his report is very
accurate, and now before me, I shall state it in his own
words, in the note below*.
