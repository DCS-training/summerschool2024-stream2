for oats.  Some farmers sow clover alone; others mix a little
rye-grass with it.
   In the higher grounds, or, as they are sometimes improperly
called, Dryfield, some farmers have, the 1st year fallow, or
potatoes; the 2d, wheat; the 3d, beans and pease; the 4th,
barley and grass seeds; the 5th hay, the second crop being cut
for soiling, or sometimes pastured.  Some take, in the 6th year,
hay, and then it is pastured for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years, and afterwards
broke up for oats.-When the ground is designed to be pastur-
ed, white clover, (and sometimes a little yellow), with a small
quantity of narrow-leaved plantain, or rib grass is mixed with
the red dover and rye grass.  The produce varies consider-
ably.
