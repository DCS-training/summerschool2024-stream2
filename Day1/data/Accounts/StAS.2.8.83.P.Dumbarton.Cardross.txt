                        PARISH OF CARDROSS.

         PRESBYTERY OF DUMBARTON, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

                 THE REV. WILLIAM DUNN, MINISTER.

                I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.-The parish of CARDROSS derives its name from the
ancient site of its church, on the point formed by the rivers Leven
and Clyde. Ross, "the point," Car, "of the muirish ridge," is
a purely Celtic etymology, probably not inappropriate to the ori-
ginal aspect of the place, and borne out by the analogy of other
names in the vicinity.
  Extent, &c.--Bounded on the south by the Clyde, its modern
extent stretches westward from that point alone, the shores of the
Clyde, until it joins the parish of Row, near Helensburgh. On
the north, its boundary with Luss and Bonhill parishes follows the
ridge of hills in an easterly direction, till above Renton it descends
upon the Leven, which river forms its eastern limit. Its greatest
length is 8 miles, and its breadth varies from 1 1/2 to 3 miles, giving
a surface of about 16 square miles.

<FOOTNOTE>The Rev. Archibald Wilson, the late Incumbent, having been in infirm health,
the following account of the parish of Cardross was drawn up, at bis request, by
