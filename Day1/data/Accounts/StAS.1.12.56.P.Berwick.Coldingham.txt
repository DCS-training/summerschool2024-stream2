     Statistical Account

   Exports, etc.-The quantities of grain, particularly oath
and barley, for we do not grow much wheat or pease, as
well as the numbers of black cattle and sheep, sold from this
parish, at Eyemouth, Berwick, and to mealmakers, communibus
annis, are very considerable, but cannot be ascertained with
any degree of exactness; and it is impossible to know the
number of quadrupeds, without a special survey.  All roots
and vegetables necessary for the kitchen are raised in great
plenty in this parish; and we sell a great share of our pota-
toes: but there is neither hemp nor lint raised here, except by
some individuals, who raise a little of the latter for their fa-
mily purposes, and their servants for theirs; and all our grain
is commonly got into the barn-yards by Michaelmas O. S.
except in cold, wet seasons, such as the last, and also except-
ing the farms adjoining the common moor: there the corns are
three or four weeks later in ripening than those in the warm-
er and more fertile fields.

   Disadvantages.-The greatest disadvantage peculiar in this
parish, is the distance and dearth of fuel. Since the divi-
sion of the common moor, our chief fuel is coals, which we
bring in carts from the collieries in Northumberland, at the
distance of 14 miles from the centre of this parish.  The Au-
thor of Nature, who always acts for good and wife purposes.
for the general good of the whole creation, hath denied the be-
nefit of coal-mines to every part of the county of Berwick; at
least none such have as yet been discovered.  The legislature, in
supplement and addition to our want of that necessary article,
did, in Queen Anne's days, saddle all water-borne coals that
should be landed at Eyemouth, our only sea-port, with a
duty of 3 s. 8 d. the ton, and at same time exempted Dunbar,
North Berwick, and all the other ports in the Frith of Forth
from payment of any duty for coals.  How far that law can
