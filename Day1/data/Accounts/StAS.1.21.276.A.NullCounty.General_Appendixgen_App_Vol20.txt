healthy.  Here epidemical diseases are not known.  The peo-
ple generally enjoy good health, and afford many instances
of longevity.  Formerly, the ravages made by the small-pox
have been dreadful; but for these last 20 years inoculation
has been practised among all ranks.  Mr Mitchell, the late
incumbent, inoculated, with his own hand, several hundreds
of his parishioners, and that with great success.

   Lakes.-There are several lakes or lochs in these parishes
and all of them abounding with excellent trout.  The most
considerable are, the lochs of Tingwall and Asla, in the par-
ish of Tingwall, and the loch of Strome, in Whiteness.  In
the loch of Strome, about a mile from its communication
with the sea, and where the water is perfectly fresh, very fat
codfish are caught, whose skin is as black as that of an eel.

   Soil and Produce.-The arable land in these parishes is ge-
nerally a rich brown earth, on a dry limestone bottom; pro-
ducing in good seasons more bear and grey oats than the in-
habitants can consume.  From them, the towns of Lerwick
and Scalloway receive considerable supplies of meal, and al-
most all the malt they use.  They also fell very great quanti-
ties of potatoes to the inhabitants of Lerwick, and the stran-
gers who occasionally put into the harbour of Lerwick.  This
valuable article, they preserve from the Winter frosts, in pits
dug in their barn yards about 3 feet deep.  After the pota-
toes are put into these pits, they are first covered with earth,
and then with a stack of corn.  For these two last years, black
and red oats have been tried, and promise to do well.
   The usual rotation of crops from ley is, the first year, bear,
the second oats, the third potatoes, the fourth bear sown on
the ground without ploughing; and from fields in this state,
they raise their cleanest and their richest crops. It is thus
