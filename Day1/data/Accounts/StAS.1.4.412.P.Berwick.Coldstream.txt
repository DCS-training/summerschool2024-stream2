     Statistical Account

   Tweed.-Tweed produces bull-trouts, whittings, gilses,
salmon, and all other kinds of fish common to the rivers in
the south of Scotland.  Bull-trouts make their appearance
in Tweed during the spring months, and soon after go a-
way.  When they come in numbers, they are thought to
prognosticate a plenteous season for gilses and salmon.-The
intercourse carried on between Berwick and London, by
means of the Berwick smacks, and the recent discovery of
carrying fresh fish to a distant market, preserved in ice,
render the price of gilses and salmon as dear at Coldstream
as in the metropolis.  Tweed is open to fishing from the
10th of January to the 10th of October.  In the rivers to
the north, which abound in such fish, the close season, as it
is called, which comprehends the rest of the months, varies,
and is earlier, I believe, for the most part in proportion to the
latitude of these rivers northwards in Scotland, to the Tay,
Don, and Dee.  The fisheries in the Tweed are of small
value here, but not so near Berwick.  The gentlemen con-
cerned in them have of late been at great pains to protect
and extend them.  They reckon nothing more beneficial
than the taking care that the protection afforded to the
fish, be observed, during the close season, with the utmost
strictness.  Meetings have been held by the gentlemen of
Merse and Tiviotdale, lately, to deliberate concerning the
practicability and expediency of rendering Tweed navigable,
or of cutting a canal through those two countries to the
sea.

   Minerals, etc.-Besides good freestone, pebbles,seemingly
of a good quantity, are found among the stones and sand on
the banks of tweed, as well as in the fields nigh that
river.  Whether there is coal, is not yet certain.  Some
trials have been made without success.  A company near
