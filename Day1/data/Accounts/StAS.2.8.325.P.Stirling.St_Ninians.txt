gelt there are a number of artificial hills of great size. They are
covered with fine grass, and are known by the name of the " sunny
hills;" but as to their origin or use even tradition is silent.
   Where the lands stretch towards the Earl's burn, there is a
very solitary but lovely small valley, in which are three artificial
hills, the raising of which must have cost great labour. The en-
trenchment is the smallest, and is called " Goodie's knowe." The
middle one, the " Heart's hill," is by far the finest formed, being
nearly circular, and 50 feet high, with a conical top. The third
is the largest, of an oblong shape, with terraces on its sides. All
of them are covered with the finest grass; and it is evident that
the gravel and soil of which they are composed have been taken
from the park wherein they stand. There is no tradition when or
by whom these works were constructed; but one thing is certain,
that the antiquary would be amply repaid for his labour in visiting
these interesting remains of times long gone by.
                       III.--POPULATION.
  In the former Statistical Account, the population, in 1755, is
stated, on the authority of Dr Webster, to have been 6491. The
session registers show the average number of births in the parish
for that period to be 191 per annum. Assuming the record to
exhibit the total amount of births, and there is reason to believe
that it does so very nearly, this will give one birth to 34 inhabit-
ants. Applying this principle to the earliest period to which the
registers extend, the population appears to have been,

                        In 1745,  .   5916
   Taking the number of marriages at the present day, and com-
paring them with the present population, both of which elements
are ascertained with the utmost exactness, and assuming the ratio
to have been the same at the periods specified above, the very
same results are obtained. A similar calculation proves Dr Web-
ster's estimate of the population to have been very near the truth.

   The population is believed to be still increasing, and the in-
crease may be mainly attributed to the extension of trade and ma-
nufactures.
