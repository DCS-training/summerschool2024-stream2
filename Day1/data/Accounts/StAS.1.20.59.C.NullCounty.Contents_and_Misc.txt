to which representatives are sent from all parts of Scotland; nor were any
means left untried, that were likely to bring it to a speedy conclusion, as
soon as the possibility of completing the Work was ascertained.  It is pro-
per, at the same time, to observe, that many of the Clergy, who were thus
so dilatory, were not indisposed to the   , or unwilling to oblige me,
and    , incapable of drawing up Accounts of their respective parishes;
But they put it off from year to year, an expectation of additional informa-
tion, or thinking they would still be intime enough for the left volume,

actually put off the accomplishment of this Work, for the space of above
three years.

Some of the letters I received on the subject, particularly from the pre-
sent Emperor of Russia, from Count Bernstorff, Prime Minister at the Court
of Denmark, and others, having been accidentally left in London, cannot
be inserted in this place; but the reder will easily perceive, that the Au-
thor must have been a good deal animated in his pursuit, by those which
