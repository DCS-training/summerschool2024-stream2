the kind used by falconers; are large and strong, and destroy
a good many partridge.  The migratory birds are swallows,
cuckoos, lapwings, woodcocks, fieldfares, and wild geese.
As a considerable part of the parish is in grass, the number
of the cattle, horse, and sheep is variable.  When possessed
by tenants, it formerly maintained, during the whole 
year, about 750 cattle, 140 horses, and 1100 sheep.  The 
parish exports yearly about 150 cattle, valued at 5 L. each;
and 10 horses, worth about 10 L. each.  Very few sheep are
bred in the parish.  They are commonly brought from Linton
in the beginning of summer, and great part of them is sold
before winter; the profit on them is about 2 s. each.  They
are black faced and coarse woolled.  This is supposed to be 
the hardiest kind of sheep, yet a severe winter generally car-
ries off a good many of them, the farmers seldom thinking 
of feeding them at that season; and those that survive are
so much weakened, as scarcely to recover their strength for a
great part of the following summer.  Much more profit
might be made from them if they were properly managed.
The hills afford excellent pasture, and seem to be adapted 
for a better breed.  The wool that is shorn from the sheep,
the year they are brought from the south, is sold at 6 s. 8 d.
the stone, iron weight, (22 pounds avoirdupois); the year
following, the wool from the same sheep, is sold at 13 s. per
stone.  The difference of price is owing to the soulness of
the former wool, which is smeared, and loses a great deal of
the weight in scouring.  Smearing is little practised here;
though it is said to improve the fineness of the wool, and
the health of the sheep.  This, however, has lately been
questioned.  The cattle and horses are much larger than they
were some time ago, and come sooner to their fullsize.  This
is owing, partly to a greater degree of attention to the breed,
but principally to their better fed.
