and mechancis, find constant employment, besides 55 wo-
men who pick cotton in their own houses.  Forty-three are
under 12 years of age; 72 from 12 to 20; the rest are above
20 years of age.  The wages per week are about L. 80 Sterling.
   Children are not admitted into the work under 9 years
old; and they all lodge with their parents or friends.  It is
but justice to add, that both old and young enjoy uniform-
ly good health.  The different apartments are kept as clean
and free of dust as possible; and stated hours are allowed for
amusement and exercise.  The writer of this Report can
safely declare, that during his residence here, (since 1791),
he has met with fewer diseases of any kind than might rea-
sonably have been expected among the same number of
people, engaged in any other employment.
   One cause of health, among the people in these cotton-
works, may be ascribed to a plan of farming, on a small
scale, which Mr Alexander has judiciously introduced.  He
makes the overseer of his farm set off annually from 15 to
25 acres of ground, according to the quantity of dung the
villagers may have saved in the course of the year. The
dung or ashes is led out at his expence; and he ploughs and
harrows the ground with his own horses.  On the land thus
thoroughly prepared, they plant a sufficient quantity of po-
tatoes for their winter's provision.  They pay him from
4 d. to 6 d. per fall, according to the quality of the ground.
The dressing of these potatoes is the employment of both
old and young on the summer evenings, after they are dis-
missed from the mills.  The exercise, and smell of the new
turned-up earth, must undoubtedly be beneficial to their
health; and their emulation to have the best and cleanest
crop renders them all very industrious.  It is an extreme-
ly pleasant fight, on a fine summer's evening, to see such a
number of people so usefully employed.  The proprietor of
the lands, too,finds his advantage in it.
