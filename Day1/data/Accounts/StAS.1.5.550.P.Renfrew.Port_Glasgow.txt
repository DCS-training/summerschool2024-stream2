     Statistical Account

   Though this last sum, multiplied by 36, does not nearly
amount to the present number of inhabitants in the parish,
yet this circumstance does not contradict the mode of cal-
culation proposed by Sir John Sinclair, in a note subjoined
to his queries addressed to the clergy of Scotland, and that
for two obvious reasons:  The one is, that many of the in-
habitants of this parish are either lost or die at sea, or settle
abroad; and the other is, that, as many of the inhabitants
came to this place at first from the neighbouring parishes,
they chuse that, when they die, their bones should rest in
the same spot, where their forefathers rested before them; in
either of which cases, their deaths are not inserted in the
public registers of the parish.  The great disproportion, be-
tween the annual births and burials, is to be accounted for
in the same way:  The proportion between the annual
births and the whole population, is as 1 to 27 4/10; be-
tween the annual marriages and the whole population, is
as 1 to 109; between the annual burials and the whole
population is as 1 to 58 1/2.  Each marriage produces, at an
average, about 3 children.  Each family consists, at an a-
verage, of near 3 3/4 souls.

   Productions.-From what has been said above, respecting
the extent, the soil, and the population of this parish, it
will readily appear, that its productions are, by no means,
equal to the support of its inhabitants.  It is true, the flat
part of the parish, which is entirely converted into garden
ground, except that on which the town stands, is in a state
of the highest cultivation, and produces the richest crops.
All kinds of vegetables, belonging to a kitchen garden, are
raised here in the greatest abundance.  The gardens are no
less remarkable for producing common fruits, both big and
small; and particularly that species of plumbs commonly
called magnum bonums; for all which the public garden-
