rich carse, or kerse soil.  Those on the banks of the De-
von, are a good carse or clay, though not quite so fertile.  The
grounds rise pretty suddenly from the carses, and are of a light
kind, but fertile.  Towards the centre of the parish, the
grounds are pretty high.  They are most agreeably diversified;
but the land is much infeior in quality.

   Town and Tower, etc.-The situation of the town is plea-
sant.  There are strata of rock, that run a considerable way
between the kerse and the high grounds, and break off about
the Ferry, a little above the harbour.  On part of this rock
is built the Tower, and the ancient part of the town of
Alloa.-The Tower is the residence of the representatives
of the family of MARR, and is now possessed by a grandson
of the late Earl; who has repaired the house, and made great
improvements on the land.  It was built prior to the year
1300.  The highest turret is 89 feet from the ground, and
the thickness of the walls is 11 feet.  Notwithstanding its being
situated on a flat, there is a most uncommonly fine rich pros-
pect, from the top of the Tower; and 9 counties can be discern-
ed from it.  The gardens, which were laid out by the late
Earl, in the old taste, of long avenues, and clipt hedges, are
considerably modernized; and the large lawn is now dressing
up; so that the many fine trees in it will be shewn to advan-
tage.  There was originally a natural wood to the eastward,
and the greatest part of it still remains.  All kinds of trees,
thrive remarkably well; and there are oaks, beeches, elms,
planes or sycamores, limes, and ashes of considerable circum-
ference.  There is an uncommon fine black poplar, that mea-
sures 13 1/2 feet round, at the height of 3 or 4 feet from the
ground.  The town formerly almost surrounded the tower,
as in the rude ages they afforded mutual benefits to each other.
