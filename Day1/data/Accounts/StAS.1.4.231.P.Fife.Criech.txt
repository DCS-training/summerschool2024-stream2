ting in one of the highest houses there, and on the lost im-
mediately above them were several pieces of old iron.
The watch of one of them scarcely retained any of its
former shape.  It looked as if it had lain some time in a
smith's furnace.  The lightning seems to spread like small
shot when near spent.  There is undoubtedly a strong con-
cussion of the air when it strikes.  In the room in Pitcullo
house, the glass was all forced out of the windows, though
the casements were not marked.  The house in Cupar,
where the men were killed, had both side-walls a little
split, and burst out from the flooring.

   Hills.-The hills not only shelter, but by the rains wash-
ing them down in the course of ages, increase and meliorate
the soil of the valleys.  There is a narrow strath, which
runs through this parish, E. through Kilmeny, and W.
through Dunbog and Abdie, the adjacent parishes, which
is sheltered by the Ochil Hills, and the dealers in barley

The rich Carse of Gowrie, opposite to this parish, is shel-
tered in the same way.  It, perhaps, deserves notice, that
the most remarkable ridges of hills in Scotland run E. and
W.  This holds with respect to the Grampian, as well as
the Ochil Hills.  It has been remarked, that the great
ridges of mountains in England, extend generally E. and
W. too.  The same has been observed of the Alps, of Cau-
casus, and Taurus, in Asia; and said to prevent the exhaled
vapours from going too much N. or S. that there may
be a sufficiency of rain for the inland countries.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is one Seceder family
here, and a few other individuals that are Seceders.  It is
supposed they are not increasing along the banks of the
