upon the whole about 2 feet 9 inches in thickness. The 8-inch
seam is the best. The coal does not occur in this bore, which was
made in the bed of the lake-like valley to the north of the canal.
The 7-feet of soft brown san lying upon blue till has every ap-
pearance of aquatic origin. The coal is found on the south side
of the canal, to the east and west of this bore, as appears from the
following journal, down only to the first workable coal.

   In this journal we have the blue-till on which the soft brown sand
in the valley seems to rest; but here it is mixed with shattered
fragments of freestone and other rocks, striking memorials, we may
imagine, of the destructive effects produced by the eruption of the
greenstone rocks from below.
   It was long suspected that coal might be found to the west of
Holland Hirst, or between that colliery and the colliery at Stron.
The experiment was lately made, but proved a failure. The fol-
lowing journal, however, has an additional interest, as having been
put down in the ditch of the Roman wall or Graham's dike, on
Westerwood farm. At the first breaking of the soil, a nondescript
sort of earth was found, containing the debris of many substances,
which the borers, for want of a better name, have termed surface.
The bore failed in its chief object, the discovery of coal. It is as
follows:-

   Another bore was put down near Wyndford Loch, to the depth
of upwards of 33 fathoms. It consisted almost entirely of repeat-
ed layers of hard faky matter, or a mixture of freestone and shale,
with two seams of coal. of a foul coarse quality, about a foot each in
thickness, and a coarse limestone of three inches. In one place, on
the valley of the canal, after a bore of two fathoms, they were stop-
ped by gravel.
   These bores are all on the east side of the parish. We will now
examine the west side where it borders with Cadder. We have
seen that the calm limestone is the most extensive, and most re-
