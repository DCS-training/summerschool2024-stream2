other; and the river in which they were bred is the one
they return to; a fish originally belonging to the one, be-
ing very seldom met with in the other.  They are sold at
2 d. the lb., if above 10 lb. weight; if 10 lb. or below it,
at 1 d. the lb.-Great plenty of sea trout, of different
kinds, weighing from 1 lb. to 5 lb. or 6 lb., are met with
in both rivers, from the beginning to the end of the sal-
mon fishing season; and the bay of Luce, along the
whole coast of the parish, abounds with fish: but no at-
tempt hath hitherto been made to turn them to any ac-
count.  The inhabitants having no absolute demand for
them as a necessary of life, and no market near them, for
no manufactures are established in the parish, they never
think of profiting by the blessings which Providence has
put in their power.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the
number of souls in 1755 was 1509.  Old Luce, on the
1st of January 1791, contained 1200 inhabitants, old and
young.  An accurate enumeration was likewise made in
1778, which amounted to 1275.
   From the baptisms entered in the parish register, which
begins in 1732, it appears, that the population has been
decreasing since the year 1755, and perhaps before that
period; but as there is no rule by which it can be traced,
this cannot be certainly known.
