     NUMBER II.

     PARISH OF HERIOT.

     (COUNTY OF MID-LOTHIAN, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND
     TWEEDDALE, PRESBYTERY OF DALKEITH.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER HUNTER, Minister.

     Name, Form, Extent, and Surface.

   THE name of this parish, from all we can learn, seems
to have been always the same.  It is uncertain, how-
ever, what gave rise to it.  Its figure is irregular.  Its
length from E. to W. is about 10 miles, and its breadth
about 6.  The surface is composed of some flat grounds on
the N. E.; of some valleys on the sides of the rivers He-
riot and Gala, etc.; but mostly of hills, inclining to moun-
tains.  The latter are covered with heath, sometimes in-
tersected with fields, which, after being a few years cropped,
are sown out, and afford pretty rich pasture for sheep.  It
is ill-judged frugality, perhaps, in the farmer, not to sow
some red, or, at least, some white clover, along with his
rye-grass, in these fields; this would both meliorate the
land, and enrich the pasture.
