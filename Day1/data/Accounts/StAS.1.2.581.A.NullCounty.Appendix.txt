   The inhabitants of the town of Ayr, amounting o 3781
fouls, and that of Newton, which may be called its South-
wark, to 1689, the capital of Ayrshire may be said to contain,
in all, 5470 fouls*.

   It may be proper to add, that by the constitution of the bo-
rough of Newton upon Ayr, the freedoms cannot be affected by the
debts of the possessor, only the standing crop on the ground may
be arrested:  nor is the son and heir of a freeman, liable to be depriv-
er of his freedom, on the death of this father, on account of his pre-
decessors debts.
