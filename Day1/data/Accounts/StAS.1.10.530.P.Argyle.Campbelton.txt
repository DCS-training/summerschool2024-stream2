   In 1335, the descendants of Somerled were again Indepen-
dent.  In 1405 and 1408, Henry IV. of England, by his
ambassador, courted the alliance of the two brothers, Donald,
ancestor of the Macdonald family, and John, of the Antrim.
Donald was possessed of the isles, and the neighbouring con-

Earl of Ross, Lord of the Isles, and Justiciary of Scotland,
from the river Forth to Caithness.  His son John, the last
Earl of Ross of the Somerled, or Macdonald, family, formed
