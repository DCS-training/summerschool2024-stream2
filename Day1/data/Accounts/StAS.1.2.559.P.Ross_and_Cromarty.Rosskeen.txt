and some a deep and strong clay.  A hill called Knock-Navie,
or the cold Hill, divides the lower from the Highland part of
the parish.  In the higher parts, the arable land is wet and
spungy; the soil light, and more adapted for pasturage than for
the plough.  Beyond the higher arable ground, and inhabi-

for no other purpose, than the summer pasturage of a few
black cattle, which, perhaps, might be converted with much
advantage, into sheep walks.

   Improvements.-About 60 years, ago there were no plan-
tations of any kind within this parish, and no natural woods,
excepting about the place of Ardross.  But since that period,
by the continued attention of Sir William Gordon, and his
son, Sir John Gordon of Invergordon, a very extensive, well
wooded, and beautiful place, has been formed about Inver-

The estate of Milncraig has also had very extensive plantations
made upon it, and a considerable farm about the house, has

considerable plantations of the Scottish fir, in a very thriving
condition, on other properties within the parish.
   A circumstance, which well merits notice, in an account of
this kind, is, that the parish is peculiarly fortunate in the
means of future improvement, from a most extensive and rich
bed of shell-marle, of above 70 acres extent, which lies in the
middle of the lower district, on the property of Munro of Cul-
rain, is of easy access, and can be procured at the pit, ready
thrown out, at 3 d. per boll.  Its fertilizing quality has been
amply proved on the farm of Milncraig, in its neighbourhood;
but, from the strange and unaccountable prejudices of the low-
er, class of people, to any species of innovation on their own plan
of management, it is, as yet, in very little request.  'Tis pity
