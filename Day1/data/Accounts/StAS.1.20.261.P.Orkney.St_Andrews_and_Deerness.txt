seem to indicate, that the country was not formerly as it is
now.

   Mines.-Small bits of lead are sometimes found in the
parish of St Andrews; but there is little appearance of a
mine, neither have the proprietors hitherto made any trial
or search for one.  A small holm, belonging to the parish,
consists of a rock of so black a colour, that coals were ex-
pected near it.  But though black stones, with a shining
enamel, are here found, they have little of the nature of
coal.  For thought they burn with a pretty clear flame while
the enamel lasts, yet, when that is consumed, there remains
only a heavy lump of stone.

   Antiquities, etc.-There were formerly several gentle-
mens feats in the parish, but they are all now in ruins.  One
of them, which belonged to the Coventries of Newark, was
built by John Lord Kinclaven, Earl of Carrick.  Another
at Sandside, the seat of the Buchanans, has, on a chimney-
piece, this remarkable inscription, "Who can dwell with
" everlasting burnings."  On the top of the Mull or Burgh
of Deerness, therei s a small chapel, to which superstition
has made even old age scramble, through a path in many
places scarce six inches broad, and where a single false step
led to certain death.  The Corn-holm or Kirk-holm of
Copenshay, (an island about half a mile long, and which is
joined to Copenshay by a reef that is dry at half-tide),
hath in it the ruins of a similar chapel, close by which is a
deep well, built in the inside with large stones, and having
a stair to reach the water when low.  At some little di-
stance, are the obscure foundations of small buildings, possi-
bly the cells of ecclesiastics.  In the southernmoss head of
the holm, are several ruins of circular buildings; and near
the ruins a quarry of grey slate, of little use in building,
