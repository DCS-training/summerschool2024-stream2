   In consequence of a legacy of L. 150, from the late Robert

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-Mr William Meston, prefessor

human genius, indigence and dependence.  Mr Meston's father
was a blacksmith, much respected for his knowlegde and sa-

author erected a monument, in the parish churchyard.  This
circumstance, omitted in the account of his life, ought to have
been mentioned, not merely to commemorate that instance of
filial piety; but also on account of the pure and classical stile
in which the epitaph is composed.
