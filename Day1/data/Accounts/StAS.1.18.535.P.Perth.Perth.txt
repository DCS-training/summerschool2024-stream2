made to these writings.  When I told him many replies had
been publised, and in which the sophistries of Payne had
been detected, he said, he had not money to purchase many
books, but would willingly read these replies if he could get
them easily.  If it be the fashion of the times, or has been
the practice of some persons, to put into the hands of the
poor people books of a dangerous tendency, surely the friends
of our religion, and of our civil constitution, should endea-
vour to put into their hands, in as liberal a manner, books of
better kind.

     SS17. Ancient Religious Houses.

   I shall scarcely do any thing more than give a list of the
monasteries, chuches, and chapels, in the town or suburbs,
and in the parish of Perth.  There were,
   1. The Dominican or Blackfriars monastery, founded by
Alexander II. in 1231.
   2. The Carmelite or Whitefriars monastery, in the neigh-
hourhood of the town, at Tullilum, which was founded some
time during the reign of Alexander III.
   3. The Charter house, or Carthusian monastery, founded
in 1429, by King James I. and his Oueen.  This King was
murdered in the Blackfriars monastery at Perth, and was in-
terreed in the church of the Carthusian monastery; where his
Queen also afterwards was interreed, and Queenn Margaret,
mother of James V.
   4. The Franciscan or Grayfriars monastery, founded by
Lord Oliphant, in 1460
   Besides, the parish church of St John Baptist, and the
churches which made a part of the building5 of those 4 mo.
nasteries, there were a number of chapels, some of which had
hospitals for the poor and sick, and small nunneries annexed
to them.
