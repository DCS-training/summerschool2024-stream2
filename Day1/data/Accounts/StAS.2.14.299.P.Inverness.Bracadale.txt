	would supply this deficiency. The Gaelic schools, wherever they
	have been established, have evidently been instrumental in pro-
	moting the interests of morality and religion.
	  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
	receiving parochial aid is 64. The average sum allotted to each
	person is between 4s. and 5s.; the annual amount of contribu-
	tion is L. 20, 12s.; of which L. 7 arise from church collections,
	L.10 from a bequest, and L.3, 12s. from money at interest. To
	receive parochial relief was, till of late, almost universally consi-
	dered as degrading; but that feeling is now rapidly giving way.
	  There is an annual tryst held within the parish in the month
	of September.
	  Alehouses.-There are five licensed whisky houses; and whisky
	is retailed in various other places within the parish, to the mani-
	fest injury of the temporal interests of the people, and the pro-
	gressive and sure destruction of their morals.
	  Fuel.-The only fuel used in the parish, except in gentlemen's
	houses, is peat.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	  The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the
	parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical
	Account, are, 1. The formation of a Parliamentary road, which
	goes nearly over its whole length; 2. The system of farming for
	some time followed, of several farms being thrown into one graz-
	ing. 3. The erection and establishment of a whisky distillery.
	The first of these variations is a decided benefit to the parish;
	the second, as decided a disadvantage to its general population;
	and the third, one of the greatest curses which, in the ordinary
	course of Providence, could befall it or any other place.
