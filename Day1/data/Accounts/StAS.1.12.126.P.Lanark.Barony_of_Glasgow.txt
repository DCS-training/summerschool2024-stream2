     Statistical Account

for retailing spiritous liquors, intemperance, with its long
train of evils, is becoming more prevalent than formerly a-
mong the labouring people.  And it is to be lamented, that
by the cheapness of spiritous liquors, and the increasing use
of them, many young people of both sexes are early corrupt-
ed and ruined.  Happy would it be for the health, the mo-
rals, and the prosperity of the people, if fewer public-houses
were licensed, the use of spiritous liquors checked, and good
wholesome ale substituted in their place.
