bable, that the most of it will be used for their iron
work.
   The Kennet coal consists of two seams; one of the 30 inches
thick, and another of 36.  It was given up in 1726, and
began again to be wrought in 1759.  It has at present a 
small fire engine; but it is probable, it was once level
free, as there is no trace remaining of any engine being
upon it when it was first wrought.  The distilleries in the 
parish consume a great part of this coal.  It produces
yearly about 6000 tons of great coal, besides a consider-
able quantity of chows. after the year 1788, when the
distilleries were dropped, about 2000 tons were yearly
shipped for Leith.  It has also a very extensive land sale*.

   Distilleries.-The two great distilleries of Kilbagie and
Kennetpans are both in the parish of Clackmannan; and,
prvious to the year 1788, the manufacture of Scotch spi-
rits was carried on at them to an extent hitherto unknown
in this part of the island of Great Britain.  The distillery
laws have undergone various changes in Scotland.  Be-
fore the year 1784, the duty was levied by a presumptive
charge upon the  wash (that is, fermented worts), taking
it for granted, that the wash would produce one-fourth
part in low wines, and that these low wines would pro-
duce three-fifth parts in spirits: hence, 100 gallons of wash

* During Cromwell's usurpation, when the English ports were shut up
by the Dutch, one of the above coal works was let to a Mr. Marjori-
banks, a merchant in Edinburgh, at the yearly sum of 1666 l. 13 s. 4 d.

   Formerly there were salt pans in this parish, both at Kennetpans and
at Clackmannan pow, owing perhaps to the coal being so readily pro-
cured; but these have been discontinued for a number of years.  The 
water at this place, indeed, does not appear to be salt enough for that
pupose.
