Two occasional schools, one for boys, and another for girls,
are kept in Johnshaven.  The number of scholars attending
each may be from 20 to 30.

   Poor.-The number of poor in this parish is considerable,
owing to the variety of aged and infirm persons, who come
from neighbouring parishes, and take up their residence in
the town of Johnshaven, when they are no longer fit for
country work.  Seldom fewer than 30 receive a monthly al-
lowance from 2 s. to 4 s. and sometimes 5 s. each, according
to their necessities.  Small sums are likewise occasionally dis-
tributed among such as are in straitened circumstances, yet
not so indigent as to require a regular supply.  It is general-
ly understood, that the members of the Session have a claim
on whatever effects may be left by any one, who has been
admitted on the poors-roll, to the full amount of the sum ad-
vanced; so that few solicit this assistance, except those who
are really in want.  The means of relieving such are derived
from various sources, of which the chief are, the collections
in the church on Sundays, which last year exceeded 35 L.
Sterling; the interest of different sums, bequeathed for the
use of the poor, in the lands of Benholme and Knox; the
savings of former contributions; with better than 8 L. annu-
ally for seat-rents, amounting altogether to more than 60 L.
Sterling.  The distribution of this sum falls within the pro-
