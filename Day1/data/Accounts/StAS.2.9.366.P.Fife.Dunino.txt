year 1815. The height of the walls is unknown, but the struc-
ture consisted of unhewn stones, cemented with niortar, instead
of lime. The internal space was formed into two divisions, and
the door fronted the east.
There are three stones nearly close to the west wall of the mi-
nister's garden, which seem to have been part of a Druidical circle.
This is rendered probable by several circumstances. There, the ris-
ir)g sun may be seen ; and a few yards westward, is part of a sand-
stone rock artificially tubulated, in which, tradition relates that the
priests of the Druid faitb collected dew on the first day of May or
Bel-tien, and sprinkling the people, pronounced a blessing on them
from the God of Fire, that is the sun in the firmament, which they
ignorantly worshipped. A short mile westward is a farm mention-
ed in the register of the priory of St Andrews in the thirteenth cen-
tury, still.calledPittan-druidh, the grave of the Druids, vulgarly
Pittendrieck.
From the chartulary of Aberbrothock, it appears that, in 1242,
Stravithy estate, in this parish, paid stipend to the Culdees at
Iona, and afterwards to some disciples of the Romish faltb, which
appears to have continued at Dunino, notwitbstandidg the zeal of
presbyteries, till near the Union. For within the last ten years,
some copper coins of Charles 1. and 11., and William and Mary,
were found in a grave in the churchyard, which money, it is sup-
posed, had been destined to pay the passage of the party interred,
out of purgatory.
Twenty years ago, two coins, one gold, and the other silver, struck
in the reign of Philip 11. of Spain, were dug up, the one in the
,parish, the other in the neighbourbood. Both of these coins bad
probably been brought by the vessels of the Armada that were
stranded on the coast of Fife. They were sent to an emiiient an-
tiquary in Dundee.
In spring 1836, in afield belonging to Balcaithly, in this parish,
there was torn up by the plough an urn containing probably the
r-eliques of some Roman chief.
