the whole of them are now in a respectable and comfortable con-
dition. Some of them are very complete. They are all covered
either with slate or tile. Thrashing-mills are attached to them
all, except one; and of these, six are driven by horses, one by
water, four by steam, and one by steam and water. At three of
the farms are saw-mills. The enclosures also have been of late
much attended to, and considerably improved. They consist both
of stone fences and hedges. The latter are increasing. A con-
siderable extent of stone wall, in the south part of the parish, has
lately been re-moved, and been replaced by hedges ; and of the
many new enclosures which have been recently formed, not one
has been of stone. The hedges are in general well managed, and
in good condition.
  The rents are generally a fixed money rent, without reference
to the fiars.  The tenantry, for the most part, are in comfortable
circumstances; and the families of several of them have been long
on the farms which they at present occupy. They are a sober
and industrious body of men. But, perhaps, a greater command
of capital on their part, and greater encouragement on the part of
proprietors, would be necessary to enable them to turn the whole
capabilities of the land to account.
