   Hills.-This parish exhibits a greater variety of surface
than is usually seen in the same extent, though the nume-
rous swellings which produce it do not rise to any great
height.  Two of them only have obtained the appellation
of hill.  Binns Hill, the greater of the two, is situated to-
wards the west end of the parish.  It is arable to the sum-
mit, and cultivated with advantage for the various species
of grain, the soil being richer and deeper than in the low
lands adjacent to it.  From its situation, on the banks of
the Forth, though of no great altitude, it commands a
most extensive view, along the river, from the Bass up to Ben
Lomond, in the immediate vicinity of which it has its source.
The other, Priestinch Hill, in the south part of the parish,
stands on an inch or flat, which was probably valuable in
former times as grass or meadow land.  The height is in-
considerable, but as it rises with a steep ascent from a nar-
row base, it readily strikes the eye.  The summit of it has
been fortified with a circular wall, the remains of which are
still visible; but by whom, or for what purpose, is altoge-
ther unknown.

   Rivers.-There is nothing in the parish which deserves
the name of river, though it is plentifully supplied with
small streams.  The Lynmill burn separates it from Dal-
meny, on the east; and Blackness burn from Carriden, on
the west.  The Cornie and Midhope burns have their
courses through the parish.  It may be observed of all these,
that they are small rivulets, compared with some of those
streams called burns in Scotland, and that the course of none
of them exceeds three or four miles.

   Soils.-From the variety of surface which has been men-
tioned, a considerable variety of soil may be expected, and
in reality obtains through the parish, but of which, from
