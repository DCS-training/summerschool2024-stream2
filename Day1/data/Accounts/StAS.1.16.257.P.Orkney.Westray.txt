sent incumbent to get the stipend put upon a better footing,
without the assistance of the public funds of the Church.

   Ministers Names, who in succession have filled the charge
in the parish of Westray since the Revolution.-Mr William
Blaw, the first settled here after that period, there is no re-
cord of the date of his settlement or death.  Mr Andrew
Cowan, settled 27th June 1735, died 28th July 1760.  Mr
Nicol Spence, settled 22d July 1761, died 25th April
1783: And Mr James Izat, settled 15th April 1784.

   Poor.-The number of poor on the roll in the islands of
Westray and Papa Westray are 60 and upwards, for the
support of which the money arising from collections, fines,
etc. is by no means adequate.  All the money collected
in this way, good and bad, does not exceed L. 9 Sterling
yearly, from which must be deducted one third part at least
for bad copper, and out of the remaining small sum, the
precentor and kirk-officer are paid their respective salaries.
It may be a subject of enquiry then, by what means are
such a numerous poor supported?  Surely, at this rate, one
should think that they must be in a very deplorable condi-
tion.  They are supplied from the families who are in any
kind of tolerable circumstances.  Such of the poor who are
able to come out, go from house to house; those again
who are confined by old age, infirmity, or distress of any
kind, employ some friend, neighbour, or acquaintance, to
ask alms for them; but to such as have no body to pro-
cure any thing for them in this way, the necessaries of life
are sent to their own houses.  It is a consideration, in-
deed, which is very much to the credit and honour of this
place, that by such a mode the poor are tolerably provided
for; at the same time, it is no doubt a very considerable
burden on the inhabitants.
