and policies, all of which are going to ruin.  The place, the
parks, and more than 1000 acres of good land, are set to one
farmer.  This arrangement seems here, as in other parts, to
be a loss to the proprietor, as well as to the community at
large.  It turns out many industrious families, thins the
country, prevents marriages and population, and makes the
land no better than it was an hundred years ago.  Hence, at
the end of every lease, the proprietor only gets an advanced
rent in proportion to the rise and value of other commodities
and necessaries of life; whereas, if small farms of 60 or 80
acres were only given to one person, every inch of ground
would be improven, many subdivisions would be made, in-
dustry would be more encouraged, and marriage, population,
and improvement, would go rapidly on; and then the pro-
prietor would, at the end of every lease, get an advanced
rent, both in proportion to the growing value of his lands,
well improven, and also in proportion to the rise and value
of other commodities, much heightened by the increase of
demand and population.

   Population.-The town or village of Kilbirny contains about
80 families, or 300 people.  About 50 years ago, there were
only three houses there; but the late flourishing silk manu-
factories have wonderfully increased the population of all the
little towns in this west country; and, if the cotton works
go on as they are now promising to do, the number of
houses and inhabitants in every village will still increase.  In
1755, the numbers were 651; and now there are nearly
700.  Though the town has greatly increased, yet the coun-
try part of the parish has rather decreased, owing to the fore-
said ruinous policy of setting large farms to one person.
There are, below 10 years of age, nearly 180; and between
10 and 20 years of age, 140; between 20 and 50, 215; be-
