expended L.200 in building a hall, which yields L.11
yearly rent, besideds accommodating them at all their pu-

Accordingly, in 1768, a street 16 yards broad and 40c long
was formed by fetting off fues 12 yards in front, and 40

still brings the original proprietor L.2 the acre.  Since
1785, when the forfeited estated were restored, two other
streets are forming, by granting feus of L.400 square ells
each, paying L.4 price and 2s. 6d. yearly feu-duty, which,
