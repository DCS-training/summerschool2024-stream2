     Statistical Account

ly of a very fertile nature; but, in general, much interrupted
with small swamps, little stony hills, and large single stones,
which renders the tillage difficult and irregular.  Several of
the farmers, however, are clearing away the stones, and turn-
ing them to the advantageous purpose of dividing their fields,
in which laudable undertaking they are greatly encouraged
by Mr Maxwell Constable of Nithsdale, who is proprietor of
more than seven-eights of the parish.  This gentleman, if
the tenant raises and leads the stones, allows him the price of
the building, which may generally be computed to be more
than one third of the whole expence.  The tenant raising
and leading the stones at his leisure times, does not feel the
burthen; nor is his rent augmented by perpetual interest.
It has likewise for some time been the practice of the proprie-
tor of this estate to renew the leases about three years before
they are out, which both prevents the tenants from using
their farms in the same manner they might be inclined were
they uncertain of remaining, and gives the landlord an op-
portunity of looking after the management of such as are to
remove.  There are other five properties in the parish; one
of these is almost in a state of nature; the other four are
well inclosed, subdivided, and interspersed with clumps and
belts of planting.  The farm of Lochend, in particular, on
which a small distillery has lately been erected, is in the
highest pitch of improvement, and shows, in a strong point
of view, the effects of cultivation.  This farm, a few years
since, was not worth above one sixth of its present value.
There have been good crops of wheat these two last years
upon fields which were lately covered with heath and rushes.
The number of acres in the parish are about 8000; those in
rotation of crop about 3000; but it is not easy to say how
much more may be arable, as considerable tracks of what
can at present only be called pasture grounds, are breaking
