hills; and this too not for a day or two occasionally, or in a
few instances, but frequently, and for considerable periods of
time.

   Rivers.-The rivers in this district are not very remark-
able.  The Carron, both for size and classic fame, claims our
first attention.  It is, as its name denotes, a winding stream;
especially in as far as it is the boundary of this parish.  The
bonny links of Carron water are well known, and well deserve
the appellation.  For upwards of 3 English miles, that river
runs, in a slow serpentine course, through one of the finest,
richest, and most extensive meadows perhaps in Great Bri-
tain.  I suppose it may contain near a thousand Scottish acres.
In summer, during the hay-making, it presents one of the
gayest and grandest scenes of the kind to be seen any where.
   The next in order is the Kelvin.  It takes its rise near the
centre of this parish; and it runs westward through the val-
ley, in a slow, oozing, serpentine course, upwards of four
English miles within this parish.  Hence, it was formerly al-
ways gorged up at every turn the river took, and overgrown
with flags, rushes, and water-lillies; so that it frequently
overflowed the adjacent valley, giving it the appearance of a
great lake, or considerable arm of the sea.  By this means,
the hay in summer, and the corn in harvest, were often
flooded; and all the lands that lay within water mark were
greatly injured.
   About three years ago, Sir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart of
Duntreath, who is proprietor of the lands on the north of the
river for upwards of 4 miles, proposed to the heritors on the
south, to have a new cut made, as wide and deep as to con-
tain all the waters; and as nearly in a straight line as the situa-
tion of the grounds, and the course of the river, would allow.
