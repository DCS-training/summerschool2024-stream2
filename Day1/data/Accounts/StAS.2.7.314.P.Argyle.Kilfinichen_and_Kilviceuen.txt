we have in our auld Erishe cronickells that there was four Irland kinges eirdit in
the said tombe. Upon the north syde of our Scotts tombe, the inscription beares Tu-

Norroway; and als we find in our Erische Cronickells that Coelus, King of Norro-
way, commandit his nobils to take his bodey and burey it in Icolmkill, if it chancit
him to die in the iles. Bot he was so discomfitit, that ther remained not so manney

their lynage, M'Kynnon and M'Guare, with ther lineages, with sundrie uthers in-

maist honorable and anciend place that was in Scotland in thair days, as we reid."
  In the same manuscript, there is another description of Iona, but anonymous,
bearing date 1693, and is as follows:
  "This ile lyes straucht in lenth to the south south-west two myles in lenth, one
in breadth, full of litle hillocks, pleasant and healthfull, with a store of common me-
dicinall hearbs naturally growing; and some monks transplanted thither from other
places both esculent and medicinal. The ile is fruitful, and hes plaine arable ground
in gud measure interlyned betwixt the little green hills thereof. The product and

sound, 3 part of a leg, which makes it verie commodious for fishing, and all water

by the large and curious church. abbacie, and nunerie founded there. A consider-
able citie was in the ile of old, called Sodora, the vestiges whereof is yett visible by
the port and streets thereof. it lay in the midst of the ile, upon the east cost, weel

worship) we can give little account. One of these w`s dedicated to the Saint Oranus,
commonly called Oran. it is situate neer the great church and abbacie, with a par-

with them. Their credulative fancie is founded on a verse forged by some flattering
priest:

But I have seen his life extracted out of the Pope's librarie, and translated in Irish by a
priest verbatim as it was in Latin in the said librarie, shewing he died and was buried at
I. The priest was Caal O'Horan. Ther hes been many inscriptions upon the tombs
and pillars. The most is obliterat. Many curinus knotts of mosmick work yett to be
seen, though many is overgrown and covered with earth. The burial-places of the
nuns is about the nunerie. No women is yett toleratt to be buried neer the great
church or where the men are buried. This is alledged to be by Columbus' speciall
order. In this ile was a great many crosses, to the number of 360, which was all de-

place of the iland, neer the sea, ebbing and flowing thereinto, is found transparent
stones of all collours, but more ordinarily green, much resembling agatts. They
