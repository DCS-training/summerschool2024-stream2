   Constitution and Income of the Borough.-Montrose is a
royal borough, united with those of Aberdeen, Bervie,
Brechin, and Arbroath, in chusing a member of Parliament.
The corporation has continued in nearly the same state, for
about 450 years.  It is composed of 19 members, viz. the
provost, 3 bailies, dean of guild, treasurer, hospital master,

receive an addition not many years hence.  The provost

making burgesses, and entertainments on the King's birth-

expences, without such a regulation.

Tay and the bay of Cromarty, the trade of this town, has,
