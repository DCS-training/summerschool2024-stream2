   Antiquities.-Within a recent period, the west portion of this
parish is said to have contained numerous cairns, imagined to be
relics of Druidical superstition. On and around the West Lo-
mond, may be found abundance of rocky fragments of fantas-
tic shape and position ; but whethdr so moulded and piled by
nature or by the " Druid hoary," we pretend not to determine.
Within the memory of the present generation, there also existed
several barrows and tumuli, with human bones, ashes, and warlike
instruments. The consequence has been, that Strathmiglo has now
lodged its claim among the parishes which compete for the honour
of containing the site of the celebrated battle of Mons Grampius,
described by Tacitus, in which the warlike but undisciplined Cale-
donians under Galgacus were, defeated by the legions of Agricola.
