   Lakes, Brooks, etc.-Though there is a great number of
small brooks in this parish, there are only two large ones,
viz. Lornty-burn, and Lunen-burn.  The former cuts the
parish across from west to east.  On it there is one corn-
mill.  The latter is the boundary of the parish on the south-
east.  On it there is another corn-mill in the parish.  There
are three Lakes or lochs in this parish, viz. the Loch of
Drumelie, the Rae Loch, and the Fenzies Loch, all the pro-
perty of Mr Farquharton of Invercauld.  Drumelie Loch
is situated a little to the westward of the house of Marlee;
the Rae Loch about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of
it; and the Fenzies Loch about a mile to the south-east of
the house.  These lochs abound in pike, perch, and eel.  In
Drumelie loch are also to be had trout of a superior size and
quality, in this loch, and in Lunen-brook which issues from
it, and which communicates with a number of fine lakes to
the westward, are to be found trout in good order, that is
fat, earlier in the season, than in any other brook, river, or
lake in this country.  This brook has a rich muddy bottom,
in which there is plenty of slick-worm, (a species of food
which the trout peculiarly delight in), and as there is very
little current in the brook, that food is not so apt to be swept
away by the swelling flood, as it is in brooks and rivers where
there is a strong current.

   Marl, etc.-In two of these lakes, there is a valuable
treasure of rich shell marl.  In the moss or marsh which is
connected with the Rae Loch, there is a marl-pit, the first
that was opened in this country.  It was partially drained,
and opened for public sale, about the year 1734.  The drain
