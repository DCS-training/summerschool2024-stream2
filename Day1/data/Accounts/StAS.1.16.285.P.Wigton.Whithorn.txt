carry on any thing new.  This put an end to the business
at that time; but surely it cannot be discontinued long;
and as soon as a person of spirit and property knows of it,
it will be duly attended to.  An old miner examined it
lately, and was delighted with the appearances, lamenting,
at the same time, his want of power to engage with it.  A
fine Stream of water runs over the ore, and on one side it is
washed by the sea, so that large vessels can come within
100 yards of it.  The Isle of Whithorn, a safe port, is at
hand.  From this port vessels sail to Whitehaven and
Wrorkington in four hours; to the Isle of Man in three;
to Dublin, Greenock, and Liverpool in eighteen.  Upon
the lands of Tonderghie, pieces of fine copper have been
often found.  Lately, a piece of a circular form was found,
weighing 3 stone and 5 lb. avoirdupois; and six pieces in
an earthen vessel were discovered in the garden of one of
his tenants.
