by about 230 scholars; and two other school in this parish in
Saitcoats, attended by above 100 scholars.
   Literature.--There is a good subscription library, of some stand-
ing, in Saltcoats; and also a public reading-room for both parishes.
There is a good little subscription library in Stevenston: and a
Sabbath school library, which has been found to be highly bene-
ticial to the place.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of poor on the roll
is 114; of these, 63 receive only occasional aid at the new-
year, on sacramental occasions, and when known to be in difficul-
ties. The remaining 51 are weekly pensioners, and receive from
6d. to 2s. 6d. a week; and many of them, in addition to their
weekly pension, have their house rent paid, or receive some aid in
paying it. The whole disbursements by the session last year, in-
cluding the fees of treasurer, session-clerk, &c., amounted to
L. 223, 6s. 5d. To meet this, we had L. 96, 15s. 2d., collected
at the church L. 5, a donation by a native of the parish on a visit
from abroad; L. 12, 1s. from proclamation and mortcloth dues;
L. 1, 4s. 3d. from seat rents in church; and L. 97, 1s. 8d. as a
voluntary contribution by the heritors. In point of collections for
the poor as well as in many other respects, we are already expe-
riencing the advantage of having a good church. During the last
four years, 1828, 1829, 1830, 1831, the average of the annual
collections in the old church was L. 69, 12s. 71d.: during the four
years since the church was rebuilt, the average of the collections
for the poor throughout the year has been L. 89, 1Os. 4 1/2d.  And
there is the prospect of increase, as the last year was considerably
above the averaue, being L. 96, 15s. 2d. The collections during
the last year (1836) for religious purposes, such as the General
Assembly's Schemes, Sabbath schools, &c. amounted to L. 49,
10s. 10d., which is more than we ever had for these purposes be-
fore. There is so much of the spirit of independence remaining,
that there are few applications to the session till there is great need. *
   The Ardrossan and Stevenstort Parochial Society.--This is sup-

<FOOTNOTE> The collections for the poor during the first year of the Rev Mr Reid's minis-
try, from 1700 till 1701, including collections at an occasional Thursday lecture,
amounted to L. 72, 14s.  Scots, or L. 6, 1s. 2d. Sterling, which was more in propotion
to the wealth and population ofthe parish than we collect now; the population being
about 378, and the rental about L. 100 Sterling.  The only extra collection that year
was at New-year's-day, amounting to L. 2, 10s. 2d.  Scots, for "the captives at Algirs."
The chief extra parochial disbursement was L. 4 Scots money, being a year's salary
to the presbytery bursar. In a subsequent year, the same suin is given to the Pres-
bytery Highland bursar.-Session Records.
