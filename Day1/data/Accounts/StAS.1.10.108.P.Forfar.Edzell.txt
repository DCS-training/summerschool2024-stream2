   Manufactures, Exports, etc.-No manufactures are carried
on.  The only shadow of them is, that the weavers general-
ly make pieces of coarse cloth for country use, which they
sell at the different markets in the neighbourhood.  The
exports are, oats, bear, meal, black cattle, sheep, yarn, but-
ter, cheese, fowls, eggs, and coarse cloth.  The imports are,
wood, iron, leather, house and farming utensils, salt, tea,
sugar, spirits, fine cloth, many of the necessaries, and almost
all the luxuries of life  These, however, are not yet con-
sumed in an extraordinary quantity; and the exports do cer-
tainly far overbalance the imports*.
