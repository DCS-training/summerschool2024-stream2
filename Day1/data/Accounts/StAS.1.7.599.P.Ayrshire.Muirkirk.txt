   Hills, Woods, Rivers, etc.-The only remarkable hill, in
the parish, stands at a small distance from the manse, and is
called Cairn, or Cairn Table.  It is of a considerable height,
and, in a clear day, affords a prospect both extensive and di-
versified.  Two large cairns of stones are heaped together on
its summit; and here, tradition says, was formerly a place of
worship.
   There are no natural woods of any extent in this parish.
Some few banks indeed, in different parts, and pretty far
distant from one another, are covered with trees that seem to
grow spontaneously; but the general face of the country is
by no means so agreeably diversified.  It would appear, how-
ever, that this was not its original state, especially from the
names given to particular farms, such as Nether-Wood, Har-
Wood, &c.  The names still remain, and so do the farms;
but the woods are now no where to be seen.  They have left
no vestiges, not a single representative behind them, except
a few decaying old trees can be called by that name, which
after all are, in all probability, of a later origin.  Long
trunks and branches of trees, found deep buried in mosses,
confirm the notion that the woods once covered these very
spots where now only their names remain.  It is much to be
regretted, especially in such a country and climate, that these
woods are now no more, for surely the ground, or rather pas-
ture, to be gained by destroying them is by no means an e-
quivalent for the loss of one of the most natural, as well as
greatest ornaments, of the face of any country.  Among these
trees that here seem to grow spontaneously, the chief is the
mountain ash, or rowan-tree, as it is called in the language of
the country.  It adorns the wildest scenes; and often meets
the eye unexpectedly by the side of a barren rock or seques-
tered stream, seldom seen, indeed, except by the inhabitants
of the air, and the flocks that pasture around, or their soli-
