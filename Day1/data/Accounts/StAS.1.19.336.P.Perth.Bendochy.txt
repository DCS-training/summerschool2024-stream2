   River Eroch, or Ericht.-This river falls into the right
side of the Isla in this parish.  It also issues from the Gram-
pians.  It is composed of the united streams of Shoe and
Ardle, which last seems to be a contraction of Erochdale.
The Shee, called also Blackwater, falls into the left side of
the Ardle.  These rivers generally run S. E. all of them
with a rapid current.

   Divisions of the Parish.-The river Eroch divides that
part of the parish which is in continuation, nearly into two
equal parts.  One of these parts, lying W. of Eroch and
N. of Isla, is embraced on other sides by the parish of Blair-
gowrie; and the other of these parts, lying E. from Eroch,
and N. from Isla, is embraced, on other sides, by the parish
of Alyth on the E. and by the parish of Rattray partly on
the W.  The parish of Copar Angus bounds the whole,
along the Isla, on the S.  That part of the parish which is
in continuation, is 6 miles long, and a mile and an half
across.  The church stands in the middle of the western
division.  Besides this, there are two other parts of the pa-
rish, insulated entirely by other parishes, and separated
from one another.  One of these parts, composed of Persy-
on the Shee, and Cally on the Ardle, lies in the angle of
confluence between the Shoe and Ardle, the nearest part
being 7 miles from the parish church.  The other insulated
part, Drimmie, lies on the left bank of the Eroch, being a
mile from the former part, and seven miles from the
church.  These two parts, taken together, are about a
fourth of the whole parish.

   Name.-The name of the parish, in the presbytery
books, during the last century, is written Bennethy or
Benathy; the first of which expresses the pronounciation at
the place, and also the etymology (Nether-hill); on the
