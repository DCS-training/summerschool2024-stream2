so increased, that the tenants at present would be able to pay
nearly four times the rent that was paid twenty years ago.
   A great bar to improvement in this parish, is the want of
roads, there being hardly a track in it which deserves that
name.
   Of late, the practice of farmers letting ground to cottagers
who do their work begins to be here laid aside, as every
where else through the country; by which, in a short time,
there must be a great deficiency of hands properly trained to
agriculture; and servants drawn from towns, neither possess
that hardy vigour, temperance, nor industry, so requisite to
the employment of the husbandman.  The ordinary wages
of a farm servant, or ploughman, living in his master's family,
is from 8 to 10 l. per annum.  The wages of a labourer 1 s.
per day, without victuals, or 8 d. with them.  The women
are much employed in spinning coarse flax to manufacturers
in Montrose; by which they have, for some time, gained
from 3 s. to 4 s. per week.  The wages of a woman farm ser-
vant is from 3 l. 10 s to 4 l. per annum, with a considerable
difficulty of procuring them from the increased profit by ma-
nufactures.
   There is a small quantity, from 400 to 500 yards of the
coarsest linen manufactured here, and bleached at home.
Likewise a small quantity of ticking and sacking, from 200
to 300 yards, at 10 d. and 1 s. to 1 s. 3 d, per yard.  These
are for home use, and for sale at the fairs through the coun-
try.
   There are no villages in the parish, except about 20 houses
in one place, mostly occupied by tradesmen.  Tradesmens
wages, such as masons and carpenters, is 1 s. 6 d. or 1 s. 8 d.
per day.
