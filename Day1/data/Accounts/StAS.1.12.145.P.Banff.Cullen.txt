   Fisheries.-The sea affords plenty and variety of fishes,
haddock, whiting, flounders, mackerel, holybut, turbot, cod,
ling, tusk, skate, dog and cat.  The only shell-fish in abun-

fishers cure and dry a considerable quantity of cod, ling, skate

Montrose, Forfar, Dundee and Leith, where, besides their oil,

And here, perhaps, it may not be improper to mention the

of their own; but, for their encouragement to settle so far
