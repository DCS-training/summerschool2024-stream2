opportunity of raising sown grass with advantage. In most
other parts of the parish, however, the stone fences that have
been erected for several years past, are made of such a height
and strenght, as to be both good fences and a comfortable
shelter for cattle in the time of a storm.

   Woods, Rivers, etc.-Along the Ken, which is the boun-
dary between this parish and Kells on the west, for six miles
or more, there are some natural woods of considerable ex-
tent.  That of Earlston, so called, according to tradition, be-
cause it was some time a hunting seat of the Earl of Both-
well the husband of Queen Mary, is far the largest.  Here
are also some plantations, of fir, several of which are very
old and slately.  Above this are those of Todfton, Cleugh,
Glenhold, and Arndarroch.  At Ardoch, which is above
a mile distant from the river, there are some excellent trees,
both natural and planted.  It is much to be regretted, that
the greatest part of the pasture-farms, towards the north 
and east, have no woods or plantations to shelter the cattle.
The principal river in this parish is the Ken, which takes
its rise neat the northern extremity of it, and running south
west 8 or 9 miles, parts it from Carsfairn till it meets with
the Deugh, which divides Cairsfairn almost into two equal
parts, of which that between the Ken and Deugh was taken
from Dalry.  There, taking a new direction, it runs almost
south till it meets with a rivulet from Kells, called Palhar-
ron. Thence it runs nearly south-east, with many beautiful
windings till it meets with the Garpool, a rivulet which, for
a considerable way, is the boundary between this parish and
Balmaclellan.  The farther description of its course belongs
to the history of Kells of Balmaclellan.  It is proper, how-
ever, to observe that this river, though generally, is not al-
ways the boundary between this parish and Kells; for there
is a part of this parish, consisting of a piece of fine holm, call-
