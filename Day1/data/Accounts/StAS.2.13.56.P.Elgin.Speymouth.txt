   During the ten years from 1st January 1816 to 31st December
1825, the greatest number of vessels entering the harbour was 257
in 1818, and the least 154 in 1822.
From the pilotage book kept here, the number of vessels which sail-
ed during 1 834 appears to have been 204, fifty of which were loaded
with grain, chiefly oats and wheat, and carried at least 18,000 quar-
ters to various English ports, and chief towns in the south of Scot-
land. A large proportion of the remainder were loaded with timber.
The rest sailed in ballast. During last year, forty cargoes of Scotch
coals, equal to 3000 tons, were delivered here for various lime-bur-
ners and distillers. Twenty cargoes of English coals were imported
from. Sunderland during the same period, containing 18,000 imperial
barrels, and sold at from Is. 9d. to 2s. per barrel. Since the division
of the moor of Garmouth nearly forty years ago, till then com-
mon to all the feuars, and supplying many of the inhabitants with
turf for fuel, coals and wood are universally used for fire. Indeed,
in many houses a peat or turf fire was never seen. There are
twelve vessels belonging to the port, of from 29 to 84 tons regis-
tered burthen, whose total tonnage is 685 tons; and they are man-
ned by 55 seamen. All the masters, with two exceptions, and nearly
all the men, are natives of Garmouth and Kingston; and besides
these, several masters, seamen and ship-carpenters, originally be-
longing to this place, go to sea from other ports. With two excep-
tions, all the masters of the above twelve vessels are part or sole
owners of the vessels they command.
   Although they never enter the harbour, the Spey Fishing Com-
pany's salmon smacks- should be included in the Garmouth ship-
ping. From 8 to 12 of these are annually employed in conveying
salmon to the London market. From the best information I can
obtain, 73 cargoes of salmon were last year shipped in whole or in
part in the bay; 52 of these were sent direct to London, the rest
were sent to Aberdeen, and there re-shipped for London. Each
cargo contains on an average 280 boxes, containing I cwt. of fish
each, and may be estimated as worth L. 5 each box, taking the
average prices ofthe whole season.
   Salmon Fishing.-The Salmon Fishing Company employ twelve
crows of seven meneach, and seven curers in the fishing department.
Last, year the fishers were engaged at L.9 certain, and were to get
