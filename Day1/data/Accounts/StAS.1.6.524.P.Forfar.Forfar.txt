and in general less so.  On one occasion the small-pox carried
off a great number of children, a circumstance which may be
expected some times to happen in places where the prejudice
against inoculation has not subsided:  this prejudice indeed, as
well as other popular errors, daily losses ground; and it is to
be hoped that the success attending the practice of this impor-
tant discovery will make universal converts of the rising gene-
ration.  In the case alluded to, the inoculated small pox was
introduced late in the spring, and children who had not been
inoculated received the infection at the commencement of the
summer months, which, happening to be warmer than usual,
assisted in spreading the contagion.  There are many active
lively men in Forfar between 70 and 80 years old, several up-
wards of 80 years with all their faculties entire.  One between
90 and 100, who is beginning to feel the infirmities of age; and
there was one buried in July 1781 who had attained the age

they are supported by money arising from lands purchased with
the donation of Messrs Robert and William Strangs men-

*Of the antiquities of Forfar little can be said, as its charters have
been, for upwards of a century, consigned to oblivion by the hand of re-
bellion and anarchy.  A few trials of those unhappy women called witches,
together with the bridle with which they were led to execution, are full
preserved as monuments of the superstition of our fathers; and the field in
which they suffered is pointed out to strangers as a curiosity.
   Among the memorials of the good, is justly reckoned a very large bell, sent
by Robert Strang merchant in Stockholm as a tribute of respect to his native
place; and a table of donations to the poor, to which the said Robert Strang
and his brother William contributed the principal share.
