20 or 30 years pass.  The distinction of outfield and infield
no longer exists; most of the grounds are cleared of stones,
broom and furze; the ridges are reduced and straightened,
wet lands drained, and a far superior tillage introduced.
Artificial grasses have long been sown to great advantage;
lime, and other manures, have been applied; and summer
fallow is become more frequent; all of which, with a
proper rotation of cropping, have produced the best ef-
fects.  It is, however, still to be regretted, that though
these improvements are well understood, yet they are
sometimes, particularly in cropping regularly, but par-
tially observed.  The rotation reckoned best, is, 1st,
Fallow, dressed with lime, or dung, or both; 2dly,
Wheat; 3dly, Pease, and green crops, to prepare the
ground for, 4thly, Barely, sown down with grass seeds;
5thly, Hay; 6thly, Oats.  This succession preserves the
land in high order, and makes the returns much larger.
Another course, also in prctice, is, 1st, Pease; 2dly,
Wheat; 3dly, Barley; 4thly, Grass; 5thly, Oats.  This
answers tolerably well in light lands, but is unsuitable to
clay.  Farms are generally cast into 5 or 6 divisions, and
one of these allotted to each kind of grain, a hay crop and
fallow; but, of late years, wheat has greatly exceeded
this proportion, and, instead of being a first or sixth,
is nearer a fourth or third of the whole produce.
   Eight bolls of wheat and barley upon the acre, are
considered as a tolerable crop; 9 and 10 a good one; but
12 bolls of what upon fallow, and the same quantity and
more of oats after grass, are frequently obtained.  Beans
in drill yield 10 or 12 bolls, sometimes a good deal more.
They are 3 times hand-hoed; the expense of which is
about a guinea an acre.  But, it is to be observed, with
respect to returns in general, that is not easy to fix
