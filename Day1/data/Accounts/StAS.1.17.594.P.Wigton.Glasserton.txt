   Antiquities and History.- Of the ancient history of the pa-
rish of Glasserton, there has not been much recorded or re-
membered.  There were probably no fixed dwellings within
its area, before the time of the Roman conquest of these
south-west parts of Scotland.  Whithern, and all its neigh-

name which, at that time, might perhaps be intended to de-
scribe the lands to which it was given, as destitute of wood,
while the contiguous grounds were overgrown with it.  On
the verge of the sea-shore, at a small distance from St Nini-

of the foundation), and which might be the original house
or castle of Physgill.  In the course of the centuries subse-
quent, the parish was erected; its limits were defined; the
husbandry of agriculture and pasturage, was, at length,
fully established here; the labourers of the ground were
