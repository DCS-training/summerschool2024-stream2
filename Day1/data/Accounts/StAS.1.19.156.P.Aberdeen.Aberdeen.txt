vents sea-ware from growing upon it in abundance.  The
quantity of this marine production that may be driven to
land by severe storms is not so great, or of so good a quality,
as to be very serviceable either for manure or the manu-
facture of kelp.
   As the parish contains little arable ground but what is
occupied in gardens, and these mostly for the supply of the
market, few things respecting agriculture, or the vegetable
system, are worthy of remark.  The gardens have long
abounded with common pot herbs, as cabbages, carrots,
turnips, spinage, cucumbers, etc.  The fruits here are most-
ly of common and hardy kinds.  It has been found by re-
peated trials, that the more delicate kinds, as the vine,
peach, nectarine, etc. do not in general succeed.  Small
fruit, as gooseberries, currants, and rasps, agree well with
the climate.  The same may be said of the most of flowers,
both indigenous and exotic, that are cultivated for orna-
ment in gardens in the north of Scotland.  The gean and
roddan (mountain ash) are here in abundance and perfec-
tion.  But the varieties of barren timber are neither very
numerous nor plenty.  They chiefly consist of ash, elm,
beach, maple, birch, lime, willow, and holly, planted in
hedge-rows round inclosures.  Gardeners have, for some
time past, found their account in laying out a considerable
proportion of their ground in nurseries of forest-trees, as
oak, elm, pine, Scotch fir, larch, laburnum, and many
others, with which they supply not only this country, but
send annually many thousands of their plants to England,
where they can afford to undersell the English gardeners.
It is observed by old people in this place, that notwith-
standing the great rise of the price of provisions, and of the
rent of land, the difference of the prices of all the most ne-
cessary pot-herbs and roots is, as far as their memory reach-
es, but inconsiderable.  By this observation it would ap-
