   Minerals.-In this holm there is also an inexhaustible bed
of free-stone.  It is easily wrought, and is of a durable qua-
lity.  As lime is at a small distance, building is perhaps as
cheap here as in most places in the kingdom.  Several coal-
pits are wrought, at the distance of 2 or 3 miles.  Indeed,
the village most probably stands on coal.

   Means of Improvement.-A stone-bridge over the river
of Ayr, to open the communication to the south, would not
only be of great utility to the place, but to the public at
large.  It would also be much for the advantage of Catrine
if it were erected into a burgh of barony, when there would
be a bailie or magistrate on the spot, to decide petty causes.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is no market-day

to the shopkeepers, who supply the inhabitants by retail.
They, instead of being obliged, as formerly, to carry the
produce of their farms to Kilmarnock of Ayr, at the di-

vantageous, market for it at their own doors.  This is not
only an immense saving of time, but also of the necessary
expence of carriage.  Butter-milk, and whey, which were,
before the commencement of the cotton trade here, of little
use, now bring ready money to the farmer.  In this view,
manufactures must prove highly beneficial to the public, and
to the husbandman in particular.  Urged by the strongest of
all motives, gain, he will highly improve those fields which
formerly lay neglected and barren.  The lower classes of
people and their families, who, a fwe years ago, were idle,
for want of employment, now find abundance of work,
with good wages; of course, they are well lodged, and fed
and clothed in a comfortable manner.  In short, these cot-
