   Cultivation.-The farms let at from 85. to 1l. per acre.
Both soil and climate are favourable to early seed-time and
harvest.  Seed-time usually begins about the 1st of March,
and harvest about the 10th of August.  Agriculture,
though much improved of late years, is not yet perhaps in
that improved state, which might be expected from the ad-
vantages of soil and climate, and from the easy and independ-
ent circumstances of the farmers.  About one half of the land
is arable; and seldom one fourth of the arable land is in crop.
The manures chiesly imployed are lime shells and marl.
Marl is found on most farms of the parish.  It was used 
first of any of the above manures, and answered extremely
well for two rotations of crops.  But it is observed, that it
seldom does much good when employed a second time; nor
do lime and shells answer well after it.  Shells are found in
great abundance in all the different bays, and esteemed  the
best of all these manures.  One small vein of limestone has
also been discovered, but so trifling as not to desray the ex-
pence of workmanship.

same 50 years ago.  Previous to that period the population seems to have been greater.
