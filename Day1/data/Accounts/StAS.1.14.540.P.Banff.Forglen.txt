     Statistical Account

   Lord Banff and Colonel Duff have taken the 100 L. Ster-
ling betwixt them, 50 L, each, and bound themselves to
pay the interest annually to the schoolmaster, Mr. Mori-
son, and his successors in office, at the rate of 5 per cent.
   Mr. Bruce has become a rich man.  How honourable
to himself is such testimony of his gratitude to God, who
hath blessed him with prosperity!  How beneficial to so-
ciety is such benevolence!  There is no class of men more
useful than schoolmasters, when attentive to their duty,
and few worse provided.  Their salaries are small, their
perquisites in small parishes, inconsiderable, and their pay-
ments, by the poor, not very punctual.  The schoolmaster
here, however, from having one of the smallest, will now
have as good a fixed income as most of his neighbours in
the country schools.

   Mortification in behalf of the Poor.-George Gerard, Esq.
of Midstrath, late factor to Lord Banff, through attach-
ment to the parish, in which he has long resided, and
from pious motives, presently pays the school fees through-
out the year of four of the present schlars, to enable
them to read the Bible, and to write their name; and in-
tends mortifying a sum sufficient to make the payment
perpetual.

   Character and Manners of the People.-The people, ex-
cepting two or three of the Scottish Episcopal congrega-
tion at Turriff, are all the Established Church.  There
is no Catholick nor Seceder in the parish.  They are so-
ber and industrious, and discreet in their behaviour; re-
spectful to their masters and superiors, and kind to their
minister; and give regular attendance to the ordinances.
