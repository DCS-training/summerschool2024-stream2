tains, with the cloud-capt Benlomond, combine to render the
scenery very picturesque.-On the banks of the Endrick, the
soil is a deep rich loam, very favourable for pasturage or til-
lage; on the rising ground above the plain, the soil is in ge-
neral a cold wet till; and, towards the moors, of a mossy
quality.

   Agriculture.-That there are seldom instances of good hus-
bandry on small farms, except on soils of the greatest fertility,
or where there is a command of manure, is a maxim which is
verified in this parish.  Many of the farms are so small, as to
yield but a scanty subsistence to the farmer; and as no lime
or stimulating manures can be got but at a high price, little
attention is paid to the melioration of soil, or rotation of crops.
From the price of labour and manure, compared with the be-
nefit of rearing and fattening cattle, some of the most judicious
farmers, in this parish and neighbourhood, find their interest in
having their grounds in pasture rather than tillage.  But as
agriculture is acknowledged to be the most permanent basis of
the wealth of a country, it would certainly redound to the ho-
nour and interest of gentlemen, who are possessed of large
estates, to exhibit a pattern of improvement; or, if this is
not found convenient, judicious and experienced farmers might
be more encouraged, by letting leases on one or more lives.
Such a practice, it is evident, would be attended with the
most beneficial consequences; at least, it would certainly be
preferable to the custom, of granting leases of arable farms
for nine, or even nineteen years; where the farmer no sooner
begins to improve, than he pursues an opposite system, of ex-
hausting his farm by too frequent cropping, from the idea
that he may be turned out at the expiration of the lease, and
stranger who offers more rent preferred.
