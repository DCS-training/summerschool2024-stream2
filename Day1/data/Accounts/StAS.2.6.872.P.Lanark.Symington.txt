chial.  Salary, the maximum; fees about L.15.  The teacher
has the legal accommodations.
   Library.-There is one parochial library.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of poor this year is 11,
four of these have families, 4, 2, 4, 5, in all, 15 children; the 11
have at an average 1s. 5 1/2d. per week.  It may be said the poor
are yearly increasing.  There is a legal assessment for their sup-
port, the collections at the church not being sufficient.  The poor
do not consider it in the least degrading to seek relief.
   Inns.-There is one small inn on the road between Lanark and
Biggar.
   Fuel.-Coals are procured at Rigside and Ponfigh, the former
in the parish of Douglas, and the latter in the parish of Carmi-
chael : distance ten miles ; expense, 13s. 6d. per ton.

                  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   Great advances have been made in husbandry since the Car-
lisle and Stirling, road was made through the parish, which passes
through Lanark, aD-d opens up a fine market for produce; and if
the proposed rail-road from the south passes through the village,
at which the branches from Glasgow and Edinburgh are to meet,
the village will probably become a general depot, and speedily
receive a great increase of inhabitants.

   Name.-THE writer of the former Statistical Account of this
parish states the name Covington to be a corruption of Convent-
town, without giving any reason for this opinion.  But, according
to Chalmers (Caledonia, iii. 747), the old Parish and barony of
Covington was called, Colbanstoun in the charters of the twelfth
