     Statistical Account

to further improvement would seem to be, the short leases
and large farms.
   Very few proprietors let their lands for more than 19
years, and these frequently in quantities of from 500 to 1000
Scotch acres, without fence or culture.
   With such a lease, it is pretty evident, that a poor farmer
can do little to purpose, and that a rich one will not.  The
farmer, in vain, attempts to accomplish, perhaps with a hun-
dred pounds or two, what would require as many thousands,
and the latter soon becomes tired of laying out his money,
where both principal and interest shall so soon be lost, and
prudently contents himself with such flight and temporary
meliorations as may best correspond to the short time which
he is to enjoy them.  Were the lands, and particularly those
that are unimproved, divided into 80 or 100 acres, more or
less, according to the circumstances and spirit of the farmer,
and let for 25 or 30 years, there is reason to believe, that a
great and happy change would soon be wrought on the face of
this country.
   Sir William Maxwell, indeed, as already observed, has let
a part of his large estate in small pieces, and the Earl of
Galloway, who is also a proprietor here, is, of late, in use of
granting leases for 21 years, and the tenant's lifetime.  It
would, therefore, only be necessary to unite the plans of the
knight and the peer: Like two equal sections of the same
subject, they would form an efficient and harmonious
whole.
   That leases, during life, will be productive of better effects
than any ordinary determined space of time, is highly pro-
bable, when it is considered how naturally, and how fond-
ly, almost every person indulges the hope of attaining to old
age.
