		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	   Name.-THE name of this parish is variously derived.  It
  may signify "the chapel, churchyard, or burying-place of the
	pool,"-the ruins of an old chapel and church-yard being si-
	tuated on the bank of the river Lochey, and having one of
	the deepest pools in the river just behind them.  But a more
	romantic derivation has been given.  A spot near the village
	of Killin has, from time immemorial, been pointed out as the
	grave of Fingal.  This was once the site of the church, and also
	of the church-yard.  The name agrees with either derivation, Cill-
	linne, or Cill-Thinn.  There are considerations, however, which
	lead the writer to adopt the latter.  One of these is, that the
	church and churchyard of the parish were near the site of Fingal's
	grave, and therefore at a considerable distance from the pool.
	Another circumstance deserves to be mentioned.  The course of
	the Lochay seems to have been at one time considerably distant
	even from the present churchyard, and still more so from the old
	one referred to.  There is additional strength given to the tradi-
	tionary derivation, by the fact, that the ancient seat of the Bread-
	albane family, which is situated near Killin, is called Finlarig, or
	the field or plain of Fingal.  That the tradition has been occa-
	sioned by the name of the parish, as the writer of the former Ac-
	count seemed to believe, and not the name by the tradition, is by
	no means probable, and indeed can scarcely be entertained for a
	moment.
	  Extent, &c.-The parish is of great extent; the extreme points
	Inverarnan, near the head of Lochlomond, and Ardeonaig, on Loch
	Tay, being dirtant from each other about twenty-eight miles, while,
