acres of ground; and there is an inner circle of the same
kind, and from the same center, which incloses one of these
acres.  The other encampment is about two hundred yards
distant.  No artificial work has ever been raised upon its
north-east quarter; the steepness of the declivity being a suf-
ficient defence.  But, on the south and west, the circular
embankment is strong, and within is a beautiful platform not
exceeding an acre in extent.  Historians seem to agree that
the Norwegians, who afterwards were defeated at Largs,
landed near to Ayr; and it is not improbable that these
heights were immediately occupied, and in this manner for-
tified, by them.  No place could be more proper for their
purpose, both on account of the extensive prospect, and of
its great security before the invention of fire arms.  A per-
son standing within either of these encampments, is enter-
tained with a delightful prospect, to the south, of the lands
lying upon Ayr and Doon rivers; and the prospect, upon this
quarter, is terminated by the high hills of Carrick and Gallo-
way.  Turning to the north-east, Cunningham and part of Kyle
exhibit a grand and rich amphitheatre, at least 14 miles in
diameter.  In a clear day, the eye is lost among hills streach-
ing far beyond Ben-Lomond.  To the west, the spectator has
a noble view of the frith of Clyde, of Bute, Cumbraes,
Cowal, the Paps of Jura, Arran, Plada, Sanda, the point of
Cantyre, and different parts of the kingdom of Ireland appear-
ing between Kintyre and Ailfa.  The singular form of this
last island, rising like a mighty pyramid from the ocean, is
beautifully contracted by the similar appearance of Loudon
hill, rising on the opposite side from the land.  No wonder
that the inhabitants of the bleak mountains of Scandinavia
were captivated with the prospect, and excited to contend
vigorously for the possession of this part of Scotland.
