     General Appendix to

   As, some people, from confined ideas, may think, that the
interest of those, concerned in the Clyde and Crianan inland
navigation, would suffer, were this canal carried on; it will
not be improper to observe, that the advantages to be de-
rived from the former, can never be fully experienced, till the
latter be opened.  The three, taken together, as hinted at
above, will form a chain, in the system of internal com-
merce, which will be productive of advantages never to be
derived from them singly, or from any two of them, without
the third.
   Let us now suppose, that, in any part of England, the com-
munication from the east to the west coast were, for 200 or
300 miles, interrupted by high mountains, except in one
place, where there was an opening or flat across the country;
nay, let it be supposed, that, in such a situation, there were
only two vallies penetrating from each coast into the country,
and approaching in a straight line within a short distance of
each other, where their junction was interrupted by a cross
ridge of hills:  In this case, where nature had done so much,
though she did not complete the whole level, the enterpris-
ing spirit, for which our southern neighbours are so justly
famed, would, long since, have been exerted to surmount
every difficulty, in order to open such a communication; not
only by cutting a canal in the level part of the ground, but
also, by piercing through the hill or mountain which oc-
casioned the interruption.  What shall we say, then, of our-
selves, for our want of attention to this great object of nation-
al improvement; Where nature has, not only given us a con-
tinued level from sea to sea, but has likewise performed more
than one half of the work to our hand, by a chain of lakes,
where ships of the line could fail with safety?
   Besides the above advantages, for facilitating this great un-
dertaking, nature has been favourable in other respects.
