     Statistical Account

although such depredations have ceased, those islanders are
but hardly at this day emerging from the effects of so
precarious and distressful 2 condition; and beginning to
form something like a settled and a comfortable society.
   The Fair Isle belongs to the parish of Dunrossnefs in
Shetland; and the following account of it is taken from
a paper drawn up by the Rev. MR. BARRY, minister of
Shapinshay, in Orkney.

   The name of this isle, perhaps may be derived from its
being distinctly marked in the ocean, and seen by ma-
riners at a great distance; seldom covered with fog; and
on a nearer approach, exbiting its losty heads, clothed
with considerable verdure.  Buchanan describes it with a
good deal of accuracy. "Fara, or, The Fair Isle, is a
conspicuous object (lays he), both to the Orkneys and to
Shetland.  It rises into three very high promontories, en-
compassed with softy rocks; and is every where inacces
sible, unless upon the S. E., where, lowering itself a little,
it affords a safe station for small vessels."  It is 30 miles
distant from the most northerly of the Orkney islands, and
24 from the S. part of Shetland; extending in length from
N. E. to S. W. upwards of 3 miles, and nearly 2 in
breadth.
   The promontories are Malcolm's Head on the W., the
Wart or Wardhill on the N. E., and the Sheep Craig at
the S. E. extremity.  This last is a stupendous and mag-
nificient object; a huge mass of rock rising in a conical
form as it were from the ocean, to the height of 480 feet,
and almost entirely seperated from the island, either by
the force of the surrounding element or some convulsion
