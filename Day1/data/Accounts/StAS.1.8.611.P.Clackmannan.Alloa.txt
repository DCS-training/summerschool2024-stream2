   Hay.-The collieries in the neighbourhood use a consider-
able quantity of hay:  Their usual price is 4 d. per stone; and
the hay is weighed, at the place where it is stacked to be used.
Some of the farmers have found out their mistake, in deferring
the cutting of their hay till late in the season, thinking, by
so doing, to increase the quantity.  It does so indeed to the
eye; but in reality it is quite the reverse:  For hay, cut at
the proper time, retains all the seed in it, and therefore it
weighs considerably heavier, and has more nourishment in it;
and the second crop of grass is earlier, and more plentiful.
Besides, it does less damage to the ground; so that the greedy
farmer cheats himself in every respect.  Few, or almost no
farmers, consume any quantity of hay themselves; but this
will probably come in course, as their knowledge improves;
for though much has been done, and that rapidly, too, there
are yet many arcana, in this pleasant art, that the farmers
have Rill to learn.

   Sheep, Cattle and Manure.-There are few or no sheep kept
in the parish; nor is there much anxiety about the breed of
cattle.  There is little or almost no attention paid to the
Dairy, although milk, in all its shapes, would find a good
and steady sale in the town of Alloa.  Some, who have kept
an exact account of the sale of this article, are of opinion,
that 6 L. or 7 L. might be easily made of a cow in the year.
-The farmers are diligent in procuring manure from the
town of Alloa; but the quantity would be considerably en-
larged if the streets were properly cleaned.  Few farmers
have limed to any extent, though the practice is creeping in-
There is no limestone in the parish; but it is brought, both
burnt and unburnt, from Lord Elgin's limeworks at Charles-
town, near Limekilns.  The price of the flacked lime, deli-
vered at the shore of Alloa, is about 7d. the wheat boll (Lin-
