   Mineral Waters and Fossils.-There are many springs,
strongly impregnated with steel.  One of them is within the
house of Alloa; but it is not known that any of them have
been sufficiently analysed, to speak of their effects.  There are
various quarries in the parish; some very indifferent, a few
very good.  One of them has been wrought upwards of 100
years.  It is a remarkably good stone in every particular, ex-
cepting the colour, which is a faint red; but it endures all
kinds of fatigue.  A very great quantity has been made use
of, although it lies very deep in the earth, and of course is ex-
pensive to work.  There is another quarry on the east side
of the parish, of a good quality, and uncommonly white.  There
are reams of coal underneath each of there quarries.  There
is a field of yellow clay, or ochre, excellently adapted for fine
bricks.  It sometimes supplies the place of lime on the out-
tides of houses; but its various qualities have not yet been
ascertained.

   Wild Animals.-The wild animals are the same as are com-
mon to all the Low Country:  hares, rabbits, foxes, badgers,
otters, foumarts, or polecats, and steats, or ermines.  There last
are very rare.  There are no wild cats.  The birds most numerous
are partridges.  Some few quails and land rails are sometimes
seen in autumn; but they are abundant in the breeding sea-
son.  The whistling or grey plovers alight sometimes on the
high grounds in spring, and likewise the dotterels, both on
their way to the Ochils.  The bittern is become very scarce.
Curlews frequent the side of the Forth.  There are few herons
that breed here.  There are thrushes, blackbirds, woodlarks,
bull finches, and all the sinch tribe; sky larks, buntings, yel-
low hammers, and waterwagtails, white and yellow; in summer,
stone-chatterers, and various kinds of swallows; in winter, the
several kinds of fieldfares, woodcocks and snipes, and some-
