			CRAWFORDJOHN.                          505

eighty years old, and natives of the parish, I learn that no extra-
ordinary change took place between 1755 and 1761, to occasion a
difference of 215; and one person recollects having heard the late
Rev. Mr Millar say, that the population was little more than 500,
when he was ordained in 1750, and gradually increased till the
end of his incumbency, which was for fifty years. The diminution
of 30 from 1788 to 1790, can be accounted for from a change
upon 2 or 3 farms.

<TABLE>
According to the Government census, the numbers were in 1801	712
 							1811	858
							1821	971

This last consists of l88 families,--73 being employed in agricul-
ture; 34 in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and 8l not com-
prised in the two preceding classes.
	I have been accustomed, in the course of visiting the parish, to
take a list of the inhabitants; their names being written out, and
every page summed up, so as to render it easy to correct any acci-
dental mistakes. The following table is extracted from these lists:
