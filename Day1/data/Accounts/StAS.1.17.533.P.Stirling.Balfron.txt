water of Endrick, and in the adjoining parish of Killearn;
for, although the necessary works connected with these esta-
blishments, be separated from this parish by the river, yet al-
most all the people belonging to them have their dwelling-
houses in the village of Balfron, and a considerable part of
the grounds originally intended for carrying on the bleach-
ing and printing operations, are on the Balfron side of the
river.
   Roads.-Till within these few years, the roads of this parish,
during the winter months, were almost impassible; but in this
respect also, we have derived much advantage from the in-
troduction of our manufactures, and the spirited exertions of
the gentlemen who has so laudably patronized them.  In
this particular line of improvement, indeed, the other land-
ed proprietors, nor immediately connected with the mercan-
tile or manufacturing interests, readily afforded him the most
liberal and manly support, and thereby materially promoted
both the particular interests of the manufacturing establish-
ments, and the general good of the country; in which view
Peter Spiers, Esq; of Culcreuch, a considerable heritor in this
parish, ought to be particularly mentioned with honour.  In
consequence of these exertions, a bridge of two arches, at
Ballindalloch, has been thrown over the Endrick, which,
when swelled, is a rapid and dangerous river.  A turnpike
road has been made from Glasgow to the village of Balfron,
and leading from it into the military road between Stirling
and Dumbarton.  Another turnpike road has also been made,
which, passing through the east end of this parish, leads from
Kippen to Glasgow.  Good cross roads are begun to be
formed, and considerable progress has been made in them.
Arches have been thrown over all the streams of water, and
hollow places; so that there is now the certain prospect of
having good roads through every part of the parish.
