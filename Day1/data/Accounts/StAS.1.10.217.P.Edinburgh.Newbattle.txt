     of Newbattle.

At the east end, it is terminated by an aged bridge, rudely
built, and overspread with ivy; ranges of trees, in the oppo-
site direction, close at a proper distance into vistas: while
the eye, in wandering over the beauties of the scene, is caught
by the simple spite of the parish church, and by the smoke,
which, mounting from the adjacent village, lingers among
the tops of the trees.
   In the bosom of the park are many single trees, which
make a venerable and majestic appearance.  One of them a
beech, at a yard above the ground, measures 19 feet in cir-
cumference; the distance between the tips of its extreme
branches is 108 feet; its trunk, before it begins to spread,
rises to the height of 22 feet, and it contains, including its
principal limbs, 710 cubic feet of wood.  And yet this tree
does not greatly exceed the dimensions of many others in the
parks.  All of them, in their proper season, put forth a close
and vigorous foliage; nor can any thing but a climate, and
soil the most favourable, account for their rising, and spread-
ing to such a size.  From the same causes, the art of gar-
dening is carried on very successfully around us.  Green
peas and cherries are pulled in this place, in the end of May,
and beginning of June; and, in a good season, the finer kinds
of fruits arrive, without forcing, at their maturity and fla-
vour.
