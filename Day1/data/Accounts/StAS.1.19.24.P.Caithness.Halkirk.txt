the increase, though not so much so as it would have been
without these checks.
   Having thus endeavoured to account for the increase of
population in the period above mentioned, I now proceed
to lay down the present state of it.

   State of Population, how divided, etc.-According to the
best inquiry and calculation I could make, the present state
of population is as follows, (from which it will appear, that
the increase, since Dr Webster drew up his account of it in
1755, his state being then 3075 souls, is 105);-families
530; souls 3180; of these souls 1650 are males, 1530 fe-
males.  Below five years of age, 443; between five and
ten years, 509; between ten and twenty years, 685; be-
tween twenty and fifty, 986; between fifty and seventy,
482; between seventy and eighty, 55; between eighty
and ninety years, 20.  Of this number, there are 380 ba-
chelors; maidens, 400; widowers, 40; widows, 89; men-
servants, 308; women-servants, 321; tradesmen, such as
tailors, weavers, shoe or brogue makers, smiths, wrights,
coopers, cowans*, 73.  There is only one dyer, and two
gardeners, and three merchants.  The number of day-la-
bourers cannot be ascertained.  There are indeed several
who work for daily hire, sometimes in the year; but they
are not many who are stated ones, or make day-labour
their business by which they support themselves and fami-
lies.  I would conjecture the number of those who live by
day-labour to be about 50; and of those who make it only
a bye-job, or a business now and then as they are disposed,
or find it necessary, to be about thrice that number.  Be-
sides the above, there is a great number of spinners for the
linen-manufactures in Aberdeen and Edinburgh.  This
number is as difficult to ascertain as the former, and for the
