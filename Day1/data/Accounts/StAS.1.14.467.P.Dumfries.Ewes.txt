     OF Ewes

ritors, the whole of the parish belonging to his Grace the
Duke of Buccleugh, Mr. Elliot of Borthwickbrae, in the
country of Selkirk, Mr. Elliot of Arckleton, an officer in
his Majestys 22 d regiment of foot, and Dr. john Elliot of
Redheugh, in the county of Roxburgh.-The gross rental
is above 2000 l.; of which three-fourths is payable to his
Grace.  It is supposed the stock upon the lands of the
different heritorms is nearly 18,000 sheep; 120 black cattle;
and between 40 and 50 horses.  The sheep are the long
white-faced breed; which the tenants are improving, as I
am told, both in size and the quality of the wool, by rams
brought from the higher parts of Northumberland.  The 
quantity of wool produced yearly is between 170 and 180
packs, containing 12 Scotch stone each; which sold last
year at the medium price of 16 s. 6 d. the stone; but, by
the change of markets, has this year fold 12 s.

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-In the lower parts of the parish,
the land upon the banks of the water is generally dry,
and inclined to gravel; but towards the head, to a strong
deep clay.  Very little corn is fown; not more than 80
bolls, Roxburgh measure, one year with another:  The
produce, from the dampness of the climate, in most years,
is small, and in none, scarcely equal to the expense incur-
red by the purchase of the feed, and of the servants and
horses necessary for carrying on the labour.  Potatoes are
also cultivated with success.  Within these few years, the
tenants have sown turnips, which are generally good, and
mostly given to the cows and young cattle.-The rents of
the farms rise in progression, from 30 to 200 guineas, but
are mostly above 100 guineas.-The improvements in 
building have, for some time past, been considerable; se-
veral of the tenants having got new houses and in offices in
