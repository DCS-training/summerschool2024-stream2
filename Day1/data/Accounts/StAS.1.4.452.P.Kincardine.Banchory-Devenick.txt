the river, there is a vast quantity of moss, and being in the
vicinity of Aberdeen, the tenants who pay upwards of
L. 1 an acre for small bits of land, depend for a livelihood
upon driving peats to town, where they find a ready mar-
ket for them.  This is one cause why the cultivation of the
land is very much neglected.  Another bar to agriculture,
is the high price of labour.  A day labourer, if a good
hand, earns 1 s. a day for 9 months of the year, and 9 d.
the other 3; and the wages of a capable farm servant, who
has his victuals found, are seldom under L. 6, and sometimes
as high as L. 9 Sterling a year.  And a third cause of the
uncultivated state of our fields, is the poverty of the people,
which renders many of them unable either to stock or
manage their farms to advantage. I must, however, for
the honour of spirit and exertion, relate one instance of the
increased value of land, which is remarkable.  I allude to
Mr Fordyce of Ardo, one of those brave men who circum-

hardships in the service of their country.  This gentleman,
after accomplishing the voyage, returned to Scotland in the
year 1744, with the well-earned wages of his soil, and pur-

sided ever since.  When he took possession of his estate, he
found the mansion-house, such as it was, with the garden,
and about 40 acres of land, in the hands of a tenant, who
paid about L. 3: 6: 8 Sterling annually.  Having it in con-
templation at that time to go abroad again, he asked the
man if he would renew his lease, which was expired, at the
annual-rent of L. 5 Sterling, his answer was 'Na, by my
'faith, God has seen me mair wit.'  Mr Fordyce settled,
and employed himself in improving the land, which is now
in a good state of cultivation, and would rent at L. 1, 5 s.
an acre.  Little has hitherto been done in the way of plant-
