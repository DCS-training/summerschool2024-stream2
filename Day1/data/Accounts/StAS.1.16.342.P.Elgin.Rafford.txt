   Religion.-All the parishioners, (excepting two or three
families, who belong to the Secession), profess the Esta-
blished Religion, and are very punctual in their attendance
at church.  Viewed in this light, they appear, upon the
whole, a sensible, decent, and serious people.  In former
times, indeed, the high and mystical doctrines of Calvinism
being universally taught, and admired as the only system

no longer be substituted for the pure and rational truths of
the gospel.  On the other hand, as no earthly community
is perfect, the most prevalent vices I have had occasion to
remark in this, are falsehood, intemperance, sensuality, and
petty thefts; these perhaps will be found most congenial

Blervie; Alexander Penrose Cumming of Altyre, and Jo-

seat, holds some of the finest lands in the parish; his people,
too, surpass most of their neighbours in the decent appear-
ance of their houses, and the order in which they keep their
grounds.  In Tarras they raise plentiful crops of wheat,
