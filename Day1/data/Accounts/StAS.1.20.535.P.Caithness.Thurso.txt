lowing petition, in the name of Earl Harold, and sent it to
the Author.

"EARL HAROLD the Younger to the LAIRD of ULSTER.

   "Know, Sir, that I was slain in battle, about the year
"1190, near your park of Kirkwall, and buried within that
"piece of ground, and had an elegant chapel erected over
"my grave, the stones whereof are built now in your inclo-
"sure in that place. I had once a right to hafl of Orkney
"and Zetland, also to the half of Caithness, and an estate
"in Sutherland, where I was born.  My right to Ork-
"ney and Zetland, I derived from the King of Norway,
"and to Caithness, from King William the Lyon of Scot-
"land.  I lost my life in battle, endeavouring to recover
"my property out of the hands of a wicked and daring ty-
"rant, Earl Harold the Elder, justly styled Wicked Earl
"Harold.  Be pleased to inclose my grave in a decent
"manner, so as not to become the rseting-place of animals,
"or that my bones be not ploughed up.  My grave is now
"all my estate, which out to be held inviolable.  By so
"doing, you shew a noble example to others, to honour the
"memory of the brave, though unfortunate; you make re-
"stitution, as my chapel is now carried away; you give a
"caution to others, not to violate the sepulchres of the
"dead; and it will yield you the most manly and sensible
"pleasure, to have done an action commendable in itself,
"and which will perpetuate your memory to posterity.
"Farewekkm and prosper."

   In consequence of this application, the author was tempt-
ed to erect a monument to Earl Harold, an engraving of
which is annexed, and which has proved a considerable or-
nament to the neighbourhood.
