   Education.-the parochial school is the only one in the pa-
rish, and it would be quite sufficient for the population if it were
not for the localities already alluded to. Those children who
are at too great a distance from the parish school are accommo-
dated at schools in the neighbouring parishes. The branches-
taught are those common to all parish schools, with geography,
mathematics, Latin, French, and occasionally Greek, all which
are efficiently taught by Mr Young, the present master. The
school-fees are the same with those already reported in the accounts
of the neighbouring parishes. The salary is the maximum, or
L. 34, 4s. 5d. The school-fees may amount to nearly L. 40, be-
sides the other emoluments commonly attached to this office, which
in so small a parish do not amount to much. Besides the salary
and school fees, the master has a salary of L. 3, 3s. as session-
clerk, and five per cent. as heritors' clerk on the money levied for
roads and assessments for the poor, which amounts to about L. 3.
His fees for registering births and marriages, and for certificates,
scarcely amount to L. 1 per annum. The legal accommodations
