Some of the more judicious farmers have begun to adopt
this plan, and find their account in the change of their prac-
tice.
   Turnips are but little cultivated in this part of the country.
Experience however has shewn their utility in cleaning the
ground, keeping it in good condition, and furnishing ma-
nure; an object of great importance, where dung cannot be
purchased.  There can be no doubt that in many places of
our dryfield, turnips might be cultivated with success.
   As our seasons are generally late, the use of earlier forts of
seed must appear an obvious advantage.  The Essex oats and
some other kinds have been tried.  But the tendency of these
to be shaken with the harvest winds, has hitherto discouraged
our farmers from making much use of them.
   Several of the implements used in husbandry would admit
of improvement.  The Scottish plough is generally used, but
little attention is paid to its construction.  As those prejudices
against all innovations however proper, which distinguished
the ancient farmers of Scotland, are now wearing away, it is
to be hoped, that all such alterations as reason and experience
prove to be useful, will in time be introduced.  It is agree-
able to observe that some ploughs of a better construction have
lately been procured; and within these two years, no less than
8 threshing mills have been erected in the parish.  Every corn
mill has now a kiln contiguous to it; the kiln-heads are of
cast iron, which occasion a considerable saving in respect of
straw and fuel.  The oats are dried in much less time, and the
meal produced is equally good as by the ancient method.  For-
merly almost every farmer was accustomed to have a kiln of
his own, which not only required frequent reparations, but
was extremely liable to accidents by fire.
   A better method of ploughing, than that which the old far-
