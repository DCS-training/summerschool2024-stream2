seldom visits his work-house or his shop, and when the elec-
tion has at length taken place, nod the scenes, which had so
much engrossed and fascinated him, have vanished, he awakes
to solitude and want, and, with extreme difficulty, can pre-
vail on himself again to enter on the rugged tasks of patient
industry.  But the success of manufactures in Cupar has
hitherto been retarded by another cause, of a very different
nature, the great expence of land carriage.  St. Andrew's
Leven, Newburgh, and Dundee, are the nearest sea-ports,
though all of them are distant 9 English miles.  Thus the
manufacturer must bring to Cupar the raw materials he uses,
at a very heavy expence; and his different articles, when fi-
nished, cannot be again conveyed to the se shore, but at an
additional charge.

   Advantages to be derived from a Navigable Canal.-To en-
able the industry the inhabitants to rise superior to this
natural disadvantage, it has been suggested, that a navigable
canal might be formed, nearly in the course of the Eden, as
high as Cupar.  The river falls into the sea about 9 miles
below the town.  The greater part of the channel is already
navigable.  The tide rises as high as Lydox Mill, little more
than 3 English miles from Cupar.  The fall from the town
is very gradual, and to the place to which the tide rises,
thought not to be more than 26 feet.  It is thus evident,
that a navigable canal might be formed, as far as Cupar, at
no very formidable expence.  The advantages to be derived
from this cut, to the inhabitants of the town and of the
neighbouring country, would be great indeed, and could not
be easily calculated.  Cupar is already the store-house, to an
extensive tract of country, for iron, tar, ropes, bricks, tiles,
wine, spirit, grass feeds, soap, candles, tobacco, tea, sugar,
fruits and all kinds of groceries.  The saving in the carriage
