     Statistical Account

   Coupargrange, on the E. is held by the heirs of the late
Dr Young, Professor of Midwifery in Edinburgh.  Rent
paid by the tenants is L. 651 Sterling; and valued rent,
L. 1411 Scotch.
   Couty and Bendothy, on the W. held by the Honour-
able James Stewart Mackenzie, Lord Privy Seal.  Rent
paid by the tenants lately, L. 358 Sterling; and valued
rent, L. 958 Scotch.
   Mudhall, in the middle, worth L. 71 Sterling annually;
valued rent, L. 125 Scotch.
   These estates contain about 1500 acres, rented, or
worth annually, L. 1080 Sterling, besides 100 acres of
fir planting; they are divided and subdivided by thorn-
hedges; but there are few fencible inclosures.  There is a
great variety of soil.  The soil of the best lands of Couper-
grange, especially the level ground near the confluence of
the rivers, but now 40 feet at least above their floods, is
composed of a deep black earth.  This black earth, com-
posed in a great measure of the rottings of vegetables, is
more generally incumbent on sand than on mortar.  In the
grounds of Coupargrange it is above clay; but there is a
stratum of sand between, which drains off the water.  The
lands of Mudhall are composed of three feet black earth at
top, and then pure white sand for more than 40 feet down,
as may be seen at the place where Isla has pushed in its
shoulder and undermined.  There is a black soil similar to
this on some parts of the Lord Privy Seal's estate, but it is
generally on lower ground there, and within flood-mark of
the Isla.  It is on such ground that the feed-oats grow,
which have got a name through all the country.  They
are called the Coupargrange Oats.  They are the common
oats of the neighbourhood; but rise cleaner, whiter, and
more substantial, from deep cherishing soil.
