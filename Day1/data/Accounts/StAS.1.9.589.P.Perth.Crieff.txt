   Corporations.-  The number in each trade is not precisely
ascertained by the preceding table, as it marks only the
number of those that, in each class, are heads of the families.
The most materila difference, however, is in th class of the
weavers, who generally train their children to their own
employment.  They are therefore by far the greatest body
of tradesmen.  In 1770, they formed themselves into a cor-
poration, and began to establish a fund for the support of
their widows, and for the maintenance and eduacation of
their orphan children, each operative member paying 12s.
