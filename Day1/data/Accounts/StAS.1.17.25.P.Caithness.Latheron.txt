that such of them as are able to walk about, go from door to
door, not only within the bounds of the parish where they re-
side, but also in the neighbouring parishes.  Two causes may
be assigned for the collections being so small, namely, too great
a disregard to public worship among those of a superior sta-
tion, and the poverty of the common classes, together with
their being too fond of drinking whisky.

   Rent.-The real rent is about 1900 l. Sterling.  The va-
lued rent, in Scotch money, is 3940 L. 14 s. 5 d.

   Agriculture and Produce.-There is a good deal of grain
raised in, and exported from this parish.-There are three
kinds of oats, white, black, and grey, besides beans, potatoes,
and pease.-Sowing of grass and turnips is only in its infancy.
This is no doubt partly owing to the shortness of the leases,
and partly to the want of inclosures.  The feed time com-
mences commonly about the end of March, or beginning of
April, and the harvest about the beginning of September.
The crops on some of the strath grounds, at a distance from
the sea are very apt to be hurt by frosts, blasting, or mildew,
particularly on the Highland estate of Braemore.  The in-
habitants in these parts suffered very much in 1782 and
1784.  The common mode of farming among the tenantry
is to sow bear and oats alternately, excepting what ground
they lay down with potatoes.  If the land in this parish had
the same justice done to it, which other parts have, by be-
ing rested, and raising green crops, there is no doubt that it
would yield as luxuriant crops as most parts of Scotland.
But the cattle being small, little is done by the plough.  They
go four a-breast and the driver goes backward, with his face
to the ploughman and the cattle.
