     of Auldearn.

   The church and manse are pleasantly situated on a ri-
sing ground, which commands an extensive prospect of the
Moray Firth, and Bay of Cromarty, of part of five different
shires, and a landscape of many thousand acres of cultivated
lands.  They are situated in the centre between Elgin and
Inverness, 20 miles from each.  On the north the parish
extends four miles along the coast of the Moray Firth, 6
miles from south to north, and the same from east to west
bounded on the south by the hills of Ardlach, on the west
by the parish of Calder, and on the east by Dykes and
Edinkaillie.  The south-east part of the parish is of a rich red
mortar soil, of difficult cultivation, but producing luxuriant
crops of barley, oats, and pease.  The south-west division is
of a mould darker, and not so fertile as the former, and in
late seasons the corn is liable to much damage.  Around the
village of Auldearn the soil is light and dry, in showery
seasons recompensing the labours of the husbandman; but in
those of an opposite description is parched, and the crop de-
ficient.  The north part is of a cold and heavy loam, ex-
tremely difficult in wet weather to labour in winter.  The
east and west sides are of a similar mould, producing weigh-
ty crops of oats, but not so favourable for barley, although
barley, in general, is the grain most congenial to the soil of
the parish, and vies in excellence with any in the northern
part of this island.  In that quarter of the parish which is
the property of Lord Cawdor, the ground is so encumber-
ed with stones, that if his estate was cleared of them, it is
computed it would rise one-fifth in value.

   Climate.-The climate is mild and serene, at least in the
lower and level parts of the parish.  No diseases peculiar
to the place are prevalent.  Notwithstanding the immoderate
use of spiritnous liquors, the ravages which droptical and
consumptive distempers have made elsewhere, are here hap-
