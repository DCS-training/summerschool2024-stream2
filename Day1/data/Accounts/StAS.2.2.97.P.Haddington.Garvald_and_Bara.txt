           In 1801, the population was      -      749

   It is remarkable that there has been such an increase of popu-
lation, while many of the small farms have been united.
   The farm of Snowdon, consisting of about 1700 acres, and formerly
covered with heath, is at present in a high state of cultivation, and
produces excellent crops. The expense, however, at which it has
been improved by Mr Bogue has been so great, that it may be
doubted if he will receive any benefit from his judicious ameliora -
tions of the soil, or even be reimbursed for his expenditure. His
landlord, however, must afterwards reap great advantage from these
improvements. It is on Snowdon where the population of the pa-
rish has principally increased.
The yearly average of births for the last seven years is     -        -       25

                            IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-Agriculture is the prevailing occupation in these
parishes,-the farmers who rent the Lammermoor hills renting, at
the same time, the adjacent low grounds to a considerable extent.
The lands which lie on the north of these hills are mostly enclos-
ed, and their agriculture is in a state of very high improvement.
Lime, brought from the distance of four or five miles, is extensively
used. Bone and rape manure have been, of late years, also much em-
ployed for raising turnips. Draining has also been carried on to a
great extent. Excellent crops of all kinds of grain are raised,
but the most prevailing are those of oats and barley.
   Sheep, &.c.-In winter, the number of sheep pastured in this pa-
rish is about 7100; in summer, about the same at an average. The
sheep usually preferred for the higher parts of the parish, or hilly
pastures, are the Cheviot and black-faced. A cross between the
Leicester and Cheviot is found to answer very well. Salving or
smearing universally prevails here. About 300 black cattle have
been annually fed on turnip, and sold to the butcher.
   Rent of Land.-The average of rent of arable land per acre is
L. 1, 14s. on leases of nineteen years. The valued rent of the pa-
risk is L. 4229, 4s. Scots.
