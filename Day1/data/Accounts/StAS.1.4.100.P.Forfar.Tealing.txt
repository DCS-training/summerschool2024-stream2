     Statistical Account

   The average number of scholars at the parochial school
is only about 30, owing to the badness of the roads here
in the winter-season, and the nearness of the skirts of the
parish to the schools of the parishes around.  The quarter-
ly payments are, for English, 1 s. 6 d.; for writing, 2 s.;
for arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d.  The schoolmaster's salary is L. 6
Sterling, and as session-clerk he receives L 2, with about
L. 1 more in perquisites for baptisms and marriages.
His whole emoluments, exclusive of a house, garden
and small glebe of about an English acre, do not exceed
L. 17 Sterling.  The number of constant poor is 4; of
those who receive occasional supplies, 5.

9 d. a woman, besides victuals.  About 40 years ago, wa-
ges were 6 d. or 4 d. and victuals.  As a child, in this part
of the country, commonly finds employment at 8 or 9
years of age, a labourer has seldom, entirely at least, upon
his hands above 3 children at once; that number he brings
up without assistance.  The incumbent does not remember
any man's asking assistance from the poors funds on account
of the number of his children, however great, if he and
they were in health.  If they are all well, his wife, be-
sides taking care of her family, may earn a shilling a-
week by spinning; nay, provided they have a cow, which
is generally the case, she may earn other two shillings in
the same space by the sale of butter for 3 months in the
year.  When a ploughman does not eat in the family, he
