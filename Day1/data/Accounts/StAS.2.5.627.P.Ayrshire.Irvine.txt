	Eminent Men.--The celebrated Mr Dickson, to be after men-
tioned as minister of Irvine, was a poet; and, among other poems,
he published the hymn, well known under the title of "O Mother
dear Jerusalem." But, a poet of higher genius and greater name,
is also claimed by Irvine as one of her sons,--James Montgomerie
of Sheffield. At the period of his birth in "the Half-way," the
street so called was part of the suburbs of the royal burgh of Ir-
vine, and was held as part of the parish quoad sacra; and although
the district referred to is now a distinct parish in these respects,
it lies within the parliamentary burgh as now constituted.  Late-
ly, when on a visit to his native place, Mr Montgomerie was pub-
licly received, and entertained with every possible demonstration
of respect by the magistrates and inhabitants. At the time of his
birth, his father held the pastorate over a small section of the
Moravian Church, assembling in a chapel within the Half-way of
Irvine.
	Over this burgh the celebrated Robert Barclay presided as pro-
vost; and in the reign of Charles L, he was one of the Commis-
sioners to the English parliament.
	In Irvine were also born the late John Galt, Esq. well known
as an author of considerable popularity; and the Right Honour-
able David Boyle, at present the distinguished head of the Court
of Session.
