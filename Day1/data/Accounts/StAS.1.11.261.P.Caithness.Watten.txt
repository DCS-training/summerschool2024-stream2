     of Wattin.

   This decrease is partly to be ascribed to the more easy and
frequent intercourse with the more southern counties, where
wages of every kind are thought more inviting; partly to
the failure of crops 1782 and 1783, which forced many from
their native homes; and partly to the growing extent of farms.

   Heritors, Rent, and Poor.-This parish is the property of
9 heritors, 2 of whom only reside.-The valued rent amounts
to 1939 L. 4 s. 10 d. Scotch.-Since 1782, the number upon the
poor's roll has been greater, than at any period since regular
rolls appear to have been kept here.  It cannot, however, be
said that their funds increase in proportion.  Our ordinary
collections, at an average, do not exceed 1 s.  Sterling per
Sabbath.  Those, on sacramental occasions, amount only to
between 2 L. and 3 L.  This, with the interest of about 100 L., and
the occasional fines paid by delinquents, are all that the poor of
this parish have to look to. And, were it not for the charity
of their affluent fellow men, their wants would be insupport-
able.  All that these funds will admit of, is, the price of a
pair of shoes to some; as much as will buy a coarse covering
to other; and what may purchase a firlot or 6 pecks of meal,
