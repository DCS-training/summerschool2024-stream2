     Statistical Account

farmers cannot depend on a ready sale, and quick return of
money, in any market nearer than Betwick, which is distant
almost 20 miles; and it is to that place, accordingly, that they
commonly send all their wheat and barley.  Kelso, indeed, is
within 6 miles of Eccles; but as no corn merchants attend
there, to buy grain for exportation, the only purchasers are
country millers, who buy, it for internal consumption, and
with whom it is generally disagreeable, and often unsafe to
deal.  The circumstance, which enables us to struggle under
these inconveniences, is the goodness of our public roads; and
the gentlemen of the county deserve high praise for the at-
tention they have paid to this important particular, and the
regulations they have made for keeping the roads in a state
good repair.
