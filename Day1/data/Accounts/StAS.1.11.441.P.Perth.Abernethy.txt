     Of Abernethy.

both for grain and pasture, Mr. William Sommerville (tho'
having only a lease of 30 years) has sufficiently inclosed and
subdivided by stone dikes and thorn hedges at his own ex-
pence.  Fruit trees thrive well in the low ground, and their
fruit is not thought inferior to any in the country.-There
are 4 orchards in the parish: Ash, elm, plane trees, etc.
wherever they have been planted, grow to a good size, and
the wood is of the best quality.  The N. side of the hill is
particularly adapted for planting.  Scotch, and other firs, if
planted, would turn out to the advantage of the proprietors,
and tend to beautify the country.  A part of these hills,
planted about 20 or 30 years ago, are in a thriving condi-
tion.

   Cattle, Commerce, Wages, etc.-Both cattle and horses are
bred in this parish, of a good size and considerable value:
Some of the farmers pay a particular attention to this pleas-
ing and profitable object.  There are only 3 flocks of sheep.
About 30 years ago, almost every farmer had a flock.  At
that time there was little wheat sown, and no grass.  From
experience, it is found, that the advantages arising from wheat
and grass, and their being able to breed double the number
of cattle bred formerly, far overbalances the profit derived
from keeping sheep.  Those who now do so, have an exten-
sive range of hilly ground; a considerable part of which is
covered with heath.  Considerable quantities of wheat and
barley are sold and carried to Perth, or exported at New-
burgh shore.  Small quantities of oats and pease are pur-
chased by the farmers in Fife for seed.  The ancient servi-
tudes, so oppressive and harrassing to the farmer, are almost
entirely abolished.  Men servants get from 6 L. to 10 L. Ster-
ling a-year; women servants from 2 L. 10 s. to 3 L. Men ser-
vants during harvest (for about a month) receive from 1 L. 5 s.
