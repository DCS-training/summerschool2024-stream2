and the surplus is sent either to the Dumfries market, or to
the manufacturing towns on the western coast of Scotland-
Experiments have been made to raise wheat, barley, and
rye; but the attempts have not been so successful, as to induce
a general imitation.  The species of grain, which chiefly em-
ploys the attention, and which most liberally rewards the toils
of the farmer, is oats; and it is highly probable, from the na-

proprietors of land, and persons of power and influence, will
be roused to exert themselves, in order to procure relief both for
themselves, and their tenants, from this, and every other re-
