180                BERWICKSHIRE.

   Inns.-Two inns have sprung up in the course of the last seven
years, previous to which there had been none for a long period.
Their existence cannot but be deprecated.
   Fuel.-Coal constitutes the common fuel. It is brought from
Northumberland, (the distance to the nearest colliery being about
nine miles,) and costs from 7d. to 8d. a cwt. A few cart-loads of
cuttings, &c. from the adjoining plantations prove very serviceable.

                  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac-
count are,-the demolition of the houses and cottages on the farms
of Deadrigg, Cartrigg, Myreside, and Leethead; the first and se-
cond being annexed to Whitsome-hill, the third to Dykegatehead,
and the fourth to Blackadder Bank:-a wider spread of knowledge,
and a higher degree of refinement amongst all ranks:-a great ad-
dition to the quantity of arable land:-the rise of flourishing plan-
tations and hedge-rows:-the levelling and Macadamizing of the
public roads:-the introduction of more powerful thrashing-ma-
chinery:-an improved mode of husbandry:-and the erection of
a new church.
   A change from the four to the five-shift system,-a facility of
obtaining tiles for drains,-and an extension of liberal policy on
the part of landlords, would tend to promote the interests of agri-
culture; while a stricter regard to cottage accommodations,-the
removal of every thing that depresses the remuneration of labour
below a reasonable standard,-the allotment of small pieces of land
to deserving householders, to be cultivated by the spade,-and a
provision for effectually supplying the schools with appropriate sets
of books,-are means which appear to us well calculated to encou-
rage and advance industry, and to increase the comfort, inde-
pendence, and happiness of the labouring-classes.
