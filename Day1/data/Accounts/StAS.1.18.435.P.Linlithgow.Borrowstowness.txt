seed, with other Baltic and Dutch goods.  The exportation
of coal to Holland, had become very early a considerable
branch of trade here; and Borrowstownness, for the first 50
or 60 years of this century, was a great mart for Dutch goods
of all kinds, particularly flax, flax-seed, and old iron.  But
as the manufactures of this country advanced, so as to in-
crease the demand for Dutch flax, the traders and manufac-
turers in other places, found their way to a direct importa-

siderable manufactories for dressing flax here, and large quan-
tities imported, both for dressing and selling rough, yet this
branch has greatly decreased in comparison with what it once
was; and the Baltic trade now chiefly consists in the articles
formerly mentioned.
   The commerce of this town with the Baltic, as well as that
of Leith, Grangemouth, and some other places on the east
coast, was greatly enlarged during the war with America.
That country had been in use to supply Britain before the
war, with large quantities of timber, iron, tar, pearl and
pot-ashes.  The American trade being suspended by the
war, not only all these articles were imported from the
Baltic to this east coast, and by the merchants on this side of
the island; but those of the west, to save the risk of capture
in a circuitous voyage round the highlands, made their im-
portation of those goods into the Frith of Forth, to be carried
from Bo-ness and Grangemouth, through the great canal, to
Glasgow.  Great quantities of tallow and hemp, were also
brought over during this period.  The trade then enjoyed by
this and other ports in the neighbourhood, was happily im-
proved, to furnish the means of an extended commerce for
several years after the peace was concluded, A. D. 1783.
   It is only since 1793, the commencement of the present
French war, that the trade of this town has decreased, in
