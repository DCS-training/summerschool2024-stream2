of the place is considered; the Campsie Fells being situated
betwixt the Friths of Forth and Clyde, the vapours which
collect from either sea, as they sloat along, are intercept-
ed by the high ridge of the mountain; and being thus com-
pressed) they descend in showers upon the valley; neverthe-
less, it being a light gravelly bottom, the Strath being well
ventilated, and the streams of water, owing to the great de-
clivity, running off quickly, the parish is, upon the whole,
uncommonly healthy.  Perhaps the great plenty of coal, which
enables the meanest cottager to obtain a hearty fire, along
with the uncommon purity of the spring water, may not a
little contribute to the salubrity of a climate which in other
respects might be prejudicial to health from its dampness.
Whatever other observation one might be disposed to make
on the weather in this district, it must be allowed, that it is
remarkable for variety; we have often seen snow in a morn-

nately for several days.-Of course, it would be impossible to
say, as it is said in some parts of the island, that such a month
is drys or such a month is warm; the drought of August
we have often witnessed in November, and the tempestuous
flowers of February are often experienced in July.

+Old people pretend to say that the seasons are altered, and particularly
that they have become colder; and in corroberation of their opinion, they
adduce the very flattering but fallacious testimony of what they felt in their
youth, and how the corn ripened sooner on the braes than now:  The testi-
mony of an old man, about what he felt in his youth, when his blood was
warm, and his spirits high, can by no means be considered as an unequivo-
cal proof of the state of the weather; nor is the circumstance of the corns on
the high ground ripening sooner than at present, an index of the alteration
of the seasons.  For we all know, that where the soil is thin, and often
ploughed, the scanty meagre crop will be disposed sooner to whiten, even if
