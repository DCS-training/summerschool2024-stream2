   "The Scotch fir," says Dr Russell, "is almost the only species of
wood to be seen here, and that in very small quantities."  Now there
is almost every forest tree of every name, mixing with waving pines
and firs, in all the varieties of their shades and colouring.  The
seat of Lord Napier is embosomed in woods, and many of the farm
steadings and snug cottages on the Ettrick, are fringed and skirt-
ed round with a few lovely young trees.  Improvement of this kind,
indeed, is spreading all around us, in something like the impercep-
tible stealth of creepiing ivy.  The black-faced sheep depastured
our hills forty years ago; their crop of "wool," says Dr Russell,
"was of the coarsest kind, and little adapted for manufacture; a
stone of it being worth little more than six shillings."  Now the
Cheviot breed is introduced, and is in much repute among the
generality of the store-farmers, both for its wool and for the
reception it meets with in the fat market.  "The farmers in former
times," adds the above writer, "fled with their flocks into An-
nandale for shelter and provision during the winter storms:"
Now they no longer "build up semicircular walls of the dead, to
screen the living," but the stells or rounds into which the shep-
herds gather them when the threatening snow approaches, and have,
besides, a store of bog-hay on the hills as a supply for the flocks
in case of a severe and continued storm.  "The lochs, partly in
this parish, and partly in Yarrow, (says the above-quoted writer,)
formerly lay like two dark deep dreary pools, shut round with an
insuperable barrier," and, though abounding in fish of various
kinds, were rarely visited.  Now, St Mary's and the Lowes, sur-
rounded by verdant hills, and associated with many romantic
legends, form a scene alike interesting to the angler and the lite-
rary pilgrim.
