all for his won estate:  The rest of the parish is, therefore,
served with that commodity, from the neighbouring parish of
Lesmahagow, where it abounds.  Large beds of freestone are
found evey where in this parish; of this there are several va-
rieties, all generally of a fine grain, and fair colour.  Iron
stone is also plentiful, and the waters of several spring are so
strongly tinctured with it, as to deposit considerable quantities
of ore in their course.

   Antiquities.-In a beautiful valley upon the Clyde, a little
above Dalserf village, formerly stood a Romish chapel, dedi-
cated to St Patrick, from whence the valley takes the name of
Dalpatrick.  The vestiges of this chapel are still to be seen.-
Another stood in the interior part of the parish, about a mile
distant, upon the side of a rivulet; which hence gets the name
of Chapelburn.
