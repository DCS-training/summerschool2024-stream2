ation, the soils the season, and the climate, are unfavourable
to them.  These yield very little to art; it therefore be-
comes the business of art to adapt herself to them.  It is for
this reason that the farmers in this county do not begin
their oat seed till the beginning or middle of April; nor
their bear seeds till the beginning or middle of May, the
seasons when the one and the other are usually over in the
south of Scotland.  Not that the farmers here are not equal-

but that their experience convinces them no less of the dan-

   It must not, however, be denied, that the improvements
which might be made here, by inclosing, fallowing, and
green crops, have been hitherto too much neglected.

   Churches, Manse, etc.-The church of Walls formerly
stood at the Kirkhope, but is now in a more centrical situa-

the year 1743, and last year was thoroughly repaired.  It is
rather small for the parish, but commodiously contrived and
well seated.  The church of Flota had stood for many years
without a roof; but, about 12 years ago, it was roofed in,
being thatched with heather, and furnished with new seats
and new windows.
   The manse was built in 1782, not where it formerly stood,
and where the glebe still is, on the top of the Hill of Fea
on the south side, but on the north side of Longhope, al-
most opposite to the church.  The former situation, in point
of prospect, dryness of its stance, and convenience in being
near the church, as well as in some other respects, was far
preferable to the present.  But in a country where there are
few days, even in summer, that a fire can be dispensed with,
the article of fuel comes to be a matter of material conse-
