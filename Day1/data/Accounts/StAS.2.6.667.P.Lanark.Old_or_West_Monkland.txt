   Education.-There is one parochial school, and three branch
schools, but one of these is at present vacant.  The instruction
given at these schools consists of English reading, writing, arith-
metic, grammar, geography, Latin, and Greek; to which might
be conveniently added, practical mathematics, land-surveying, and
composition.  The salary of the parish schoolmaster is L.31, and
that of each of the others, L.6, 15s. 11d. per annum.  The amount
of school-fees cannot be given, as no returns were received from
the teachers.  The other-emoluments of the parish schoolmaster
are derived from the office of session-clerk; but the amount is not
ascertained.  At the schools, not parochial, English reading, gram-
mar, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping are taught, and at

                       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The population of this parish is at present advancing at an
amazing rate, and this prosperity is entirely owing to the coal
and iron trade, stimulated by the discovery of the black band of
ironstone, and the method of fusing iron by the hot blast.  New
villages are springing up almost every month, and it is quite im-
possible to keep pace with the march of prosperity, and the in-
crease of the population.
