     of Balmaclellan.

The woods, chiefly natural, lie along the banks of the Kenn.
These are well preserved, and in good condition.  Those
more inland are generally low and scraggy, calculated more
for shelter than for use.  The lochs or lakes are five, vari-
ously scattered around the hills, plentifully stocked either
with eels, trout, or pike; and some with all these species in
common.  One, in particular; named Loch Brack, although
of very small extent, is remarkable for an excellent fort of
trout, distinguished alike for size and colour, measuring from
9 to 18 inches in length, and many of them weighing 8 or
10 English pounds.

   Soil and Agriculture.-The soil of this parish is chiefly of
two kinds.  The first, lying along the Kenn, on the western
side of the parish, is generally dry, light, and gravellish;
remarkable for its kindliness, and needs only the assistance of
some exciting manure, as lime or marl, to render it produc-
tive of the most abundant crops.  This soil, which compre-
hends the principal arable part of the parish, generally reaches
inland to about two miles distance from the banks of the
Kenn.  The other, which occupies the middle and eastern
parts, consists generally of a light, but sometimes of a deeper
moss, both commonly covered with heath.  Of these, the
former is often found mixed with earth, but is commonly so
ragged and perplexed with stones and rock, as to defy every
attempt of the plough to better its condition.  Even here,
however, there are interspersed parcels of a much superior
kind, and but little differing from the soil described on the
western side.  On such spots the farm-houses are generally
set down.  There they enjoy the benefit of planting abun-
dance of potatoes, of sowing a little rye, barley, or oats; but
these last most frequently in quantities by no means sufficient
for the consumption of the farm.
