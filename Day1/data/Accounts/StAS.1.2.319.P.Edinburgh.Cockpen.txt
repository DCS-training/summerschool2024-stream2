years, from 1741, was 25.  For a like period, from 1784,
it was 30.

   Farms.-About 40 years ago, a number of small farmers
cultivated the lands in the parish, and lived in some degree of
plenty; at present, 7 families, of that description, occupy
almost entirely the whole district.  They discover a great spi-
rit of enterprize and zeal for improvement, and live in a de-
gree of affluence, unknown to their more humble predeces-
sors.

   Scarcity in 1782,-and the Poor.-During the scarcity
which afflicted the kingdom, in the years 1782,and 1783,
L. 43: 10: 3 was expended in relieving the necessities of the
poor in this parish.  Of that sum, L. 30 was railed by an as-
sessiment upon the heritors and tenants.  For some years af-
terwards, the number of poor was greater than usual; but it is
now diminishing, and the expenditure of 1789, for their sup-
port, was no more than L. 13: 16: 9.  This sum is almost
wholly collected at the church doors, from the labourers, me-
chanics, and farmers; who are, in general, very regular in
their attendance on divine worship.
   The number of poor relieved, from the funds of the parish,
at present, is 11; and the most necessitous of them, do not re-
ceive above 3 s 6 d. monthly.  Even this sum, which is more
than what is generally given, is but a scanty provision for a
family, consisting of 2 or 3 persons, who must depend upon
their own industry, and labour for what they find to be farther
necessary.-In the country part of the parish, instances of
deep wretchedness, not unfrequently occur, from the inade-
quate means of relief, and the want of employment, suited to
the strenght, of state, of the feeble and the aged.
