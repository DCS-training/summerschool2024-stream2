are to the whole population, nearly in the proportion of 1 to
42.  Supposing both parties parishioners, the proportion be-
tween the annual marriages and the whole population would
be nearly as 1 to 99; but as it frequently happens, that some
one of the parties married belongs to a different parish,
this must vary the proportion accordingly, and make it
considerably less.  The annual deaths to the whole popu-
lation, may be, on an average, as 1 to 86 or 90.  The num-
ber of married men having houses is about 160; the num-
ber of bachelors having ditto, 14, and widowers having
ditto, 10.  Each marriage, at an average, produces between
4 and 5 children.  None were ever known here to have died
for want.  The people in general being sober and indu-
strious, such crimes as murder and robbery are unknown.
One or two some years ago emigrated to America, though
from no necessity, or want of good employment at home.
None have been banished from the parish as far back as can
be remembered.  A few cottages have been suffered to fall,
but others in general have been built in lieu of them.
The number of inhabited houses is about 224, and the
number of persons at an average to each inhabited house,
is between 4 and 5.

   Manufactures, etc.-The following are the principal:
Two master bleachers residing with their families, one at
the bleachfield of Logie, the other at the bleachfield of
Craigo.  At Logic bleachfield, belonging to a company in
Montrose, who have the field in tack from the proprietor
of Craigo, there is a complete apparatus for bleaching of
thread, and the quantity bleached here annually is from
60,000 to 70,000 spindles, which is almost wholly disposed
of at the London market.  This work, which was set a-go-
ing about 30 years since, but which has of late been on the
increase, affords employment each season to about 40 hands,
