     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF KILTEARN.

     By the Rev. Mr HARRY ROBERTSON.

     Origin of the Name.

   KILTEARN derives its name from the two Gaelic words, viz.
viz.  Keil Tighearn, signifying the burying place of the
laird or great man; but there is no record or tradition from
which we can learn what great man was first buried here.
The Munro's of Fowlis, the chief family in the parish, were
buried, for several centuries, at Chanonry, and only began
to bury at Kiltearn anno 1588.

   It is well known that many other places in Scotland owe
their names to a familar cause, viz. their giving burial to some
saint or eminent person; and the names of these places begin
with Kil, being a contraction of Keil, as Kilmuir, i. e.  Mary's 
burial place; Killin, Kilbride, Kilfyth, Kildonan, etc.

   Situatioon, Extent, and Surface.-This parish is situated about
the middle of the country of Ross, in the district called Ferin-
donald, of which we shall speak afterwards.  It belongs to
the Presbytery of Dingwall, and synod of Ross; and stretch-
es along the north side of the bay that runs up from Cromar-
ty to Dingwall, being about six miles long from Novar-
