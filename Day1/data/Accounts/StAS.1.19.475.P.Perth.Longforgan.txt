   is said "to have built this castle upon a very remarkable
"rock, a little to the south west of Forgund, and called it
"Huntly."  It does not appear why he gave it the name;
but there is an adjoining field, and a bridge across the rivu-
let which runs through the park, both of which bear the
name of Huntly.  It is said, that having married a daughter
of the Earl of Huntly, he named his castle in honour of his
lady.  It is entirely built of Kingoody stone; and the
country people have a tradition, that the materials were all
brought by water to the spot.  Be that as it may, there is
every appearance of this rock, at home very distant period,
being washed, if not surrounded by water; and if there be any
foundation for this tradition, it is probable that there was a
place of strength upon this rock many years before the
1452.
   There is another circumstance which adds weight to this
conjecture.  The south-west face of the rock had been so
much wasted by the weather, or some other more powerful
cause, that sometime between the year 1660 and 1670, or
thereabouts, Earl Patrick had judged it necessary to build a
facing, or massy buttress, to cover the rock to the west-
ward, to protect that fide of the castle.  This buttress is
very distinguishable from the rest of the building of the
castle, and is easily known to be Earl Patrick's, from the
corresponding style of building with his other works: Now,
it is hardly probable, that from the year 1452 to 1660, a
distance only of 208 years, so great a waste could have been
made upon the face of a whin rock, by the common opera-
tion of wind and weather, as to make such a facing neces-
sary; and is so, especially as the estate had been long in the
family before, the probability is, that the original building
had been much more ancient, and that it had only been re-
