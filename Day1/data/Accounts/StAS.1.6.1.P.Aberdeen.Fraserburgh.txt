     PARISH OF FRASERBURGH.

     (PRESBYTERY OF DEER, SYNOD AND COUNTY OF
     ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER SIMPSON.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE antient name was Philorth, concerning whose ety-
mology little except conjecture can be advanced.  In 
the middle of the 16th century, a town was erected upon 
the estate of Sir Alexander Fraser of Philorth, which, from 
the name of the superior, was called Fraserburgh, and soon 
became a place of considerable trade.-From it arose the 
present denomination of the whole parish; which, at an ave-
rage, is about 3 1/2 miles in breadth from east to west.  The 
distance between the northern and southern extremities, is a-
bout 8 miles; but the parish of Rathen intersects, and di-
vides it into two nearly equal parts, each about 3 miles long-
