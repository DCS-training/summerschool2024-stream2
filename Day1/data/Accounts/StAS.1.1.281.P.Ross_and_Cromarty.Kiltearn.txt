Sterling, which is distributed once a year among the most
indigent persons of the parish by the kirk-session, in presence

   Rivers, Lakes, and Fisheries.-Among the several streams
of water which run through this parish, only two of them
deserve to be mentioned.  First, Skiak, which falls into the
sea, close by the church.  The banks on both sides are cover-

other river which we shall mention is Aultgrande, i, e. in

under the article Curiosities.  This river falls into the sea
about half a mile east of the former, and has its banks on
each side covered with trees and shrubs.  When the snow
melts on the mountains, this river frequently pours down
its streams with great rapidity, and often proves hihgly

the sea.  This lake never freezes till about the spring season,
and not even then, unless the frost be uncommonly severe.
It is about 5 miles long, and near 1 mile broad, and navi-
gable all the way.  This, together with several other smaller
