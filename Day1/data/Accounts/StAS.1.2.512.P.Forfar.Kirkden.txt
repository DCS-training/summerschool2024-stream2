in harvest, upon receiving notice the evening before.  The e-
vil consequences, which must result from this, are obvious.

   Mode of Cultivation-There are 44 ploughs in the parish
all drawn by horses; but many of them hardly deserve the
name of ploughs; for several of those, who rent about 12 or
15 acres of land, keep only one horse, and, joining with ano-
ther in the same state, with these two, commonly but indiffe-
rent, horses, they cultivate both farms.  A tenant with two
ploughs, and 8 strong horses, is supposed able to manage a
farm of 200 acres to great perfection.  It is true, there are
often but two horses in the plough; and he stirs his barley
ground sometimes, with one horse only, while the other hor-
ses are doing other parts of the farm work.-The mode
of farming is various, according as the tenants, who have old
leases, are skilled in husbandry, or otherwise, or according to
the taste, and knowledge of the proprietor, by whom, in the late
leases, they are often tied down to a certain rotation of crops.
In general, however, about half of the land is in grain of va-
rious kinds, and the other half sown with grass seeds.  What-
ever number of crops, in grain, are taken, the land lies as long
in grass.  The following is a common rotation:  After grass,
1ft, oats, 2dly, turnips, pease, potatoes, or lint; 3rdly, barley
and grass seeds, keeping it in grass three years.

   Stock and Produce.-The stock in this parish principally con-
sists of black cattle and horses: there are almost no hogs, and
not above 150 sheep.  In regard to produce, after supplying
the parish itself, large quantities of meal are annually sold in
the neigbouring towns; and about 1200 bolls of barley,
(31,600 stone), are annually exported.  Through the whole 
summer, butter and cheese are weekly carried to the different
markets around us.
