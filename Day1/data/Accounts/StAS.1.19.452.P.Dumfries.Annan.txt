Malcom Canmore, and his successors to William the the Lion.
Annan was, as well as Carlisle, one of their principal ports.
It was soon after obtained in fief, with the whole territory
of Annandale, and the port of Lochmaben, by the ancestor
of King Robert Bruce.  The Bruces built here a stately
castle, of which the ruins still remain.  By the succession of
the Bruces to the Scottish throne, Annan became a royal
burgh, obtaining then those privileges Which it has ever
since retained.  Edward Balliol, during his attempts to
wrest the kingdom from young David Bruce, was surprised
at the Castle of Annan by a sudden expedition of the Dou-
glasses from Moffat, and with difficulty made his escape out
of their hands, flying naked and alone into England.  While
the Douglasses were wardens of these marches, all Annan-
dale was theirs; and Annan, although a royal burgh, could
not resist their authority.  After their forfeiture, it became
subject chieftly to the Johnstones, with whom it has, in a
great measure, ever since remained, And yet the exten-
sive burgh domains render the burgesses of Annan almost
independent of the landlords of the surrounding country.
Many remarkable military transactions of the border-war-
fare between the Scotch and English took place at Annan,
and in its vicinity.  Annan was one principal residence of
those bold men of Annandale, famous in the Scottish his-
tory for exercising such constant warfare with the English
borderers, that they became, even in respect to their Scot-
tish neighbours, incapable of the order, the moderation, the
civil submission of peace.
