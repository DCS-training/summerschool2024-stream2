and his derivation of Muckairn, with some other immatdrial re-
marks made by him afterwards, must be received with some grains
of allowance. But, with these abatements, the account given of
the locality, its history, and its products, is correct and graphic;
and, altogether, the contents of the venerable document are too
interesting not to obtain a place here.
   " The country of Muckarn got its name, as is storied, thus: One
of our queens of old being long without children, desires the
public prayers of the Church to Almighty God for obtaining the
blessing of the fruit of the womb; and, some time after these
means were used, having born a son named Evarn or Edgar, in
testimony of her thankfulness for such a blessing, doted this coun-
try to the Church, calling it maodh-Edharan, that is, the valley or
field of Edgar; whence, through tract of time, it came corruptly
to be called Meucearn or Muckarn, and to be kirkland.
   "It is situated about the middle of Lorn, which is one of,
if not the largest of the lordships of this kingdom, having one arm
of the Deucaledonian sea, called Loch Etive, on its north side,
which divideth it from Benderloch, Appin, Duror, and Glenco;
on the cast and south-east side, by the water or river of Neaunnt,
which falleth into Loch Etive near the foot of the river Awe and

rivers. On the south side, it is limited partly by ; rivulet that
runs into the west end of Lochneaunnt, and partly by bills, till
the marches of it fall into the water Lonan betwixt Cliffnamacrie
and Strontvilleir, not far from the east end of Lochnell; and fron,
thence, on the west side by the wood called Gasgan and tbe wa-
ter of Lusragan, it is divided from that which is specially called
Mid Lorn ; so that its length from Neaunnt water to Lusragan
water is five miles, according to the ordinary estimation, but some
more than six good metrical miles, of 1000 paces to the mile, and
five English foot to the pace, its breadth much about the
same measure.
   " This country lieth leaning to the north, whence the soil is not
altogether so fertile in grain nor the grass so kindly as the rest of
Mid Lora marching with it, except in some tenements that lie
near the shore side; yet it hath such plenty of grain as not only
