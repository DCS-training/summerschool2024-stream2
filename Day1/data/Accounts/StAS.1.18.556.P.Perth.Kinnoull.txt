is 2 chalders of bear; 2 chalders of meal; half a chalder of
wheat; and about L. 52 sterling of money, including the
Communion Elements.  The glebe is about 4 acres and a
half; there is no allowance for grass.  The sacrament is dis-
pensed regularly once a year, at which time, no less than be-
tween 900 and 1000 communicate: a considerable number
of them come from the neighbouring parishes.  The collec-
tions on that occasion amount to about L. 10: 10 sterling.
The great number of communicants is chiefly owing to the
vicinity of Kinnoul to the populous town of Perth.  The
Earl of Kinnoul is patron.  An Antiburgher meeting-house
was built about 7 or S years ago, on the eastern extremity of
this parish; but the people who belong to it have no minister.

   School and Poor.-For several years the parochial school
has been in a flourishing condition.  The number of scholars
is much the same during the summer and winter; and is sel-
dom under 60, and sometimes about 80.
   The schoolmaster's salary was lately raised from 100 to
200 merks, paid by the heritors; he has a free house and
garden; and as precenter and session clerk, his salary is L 3
per annum.  The present number of scholars is 65, of whom
4 read Latin; 20 read English; 24 learn writing, and 17
arithmetic.  The school fees per quarter are, for English, 1 s;
for writing, 1 s 6 d; for arithmetic, 2 s; and for Latin, 2 s 6 d.
The schoolmaster's salary, together with the school fees and
other perquisites may amount to L. 35 sterling; there is
another school in Bridge-end, taught by an Antiburgher Se-
ceder, which is pretty well attended.

   Poor.-There are no begging poor in the parish; but many
vagrants resort thither, from every quarter.  The funds for
supporting the poor arise from the weekly collection at the
