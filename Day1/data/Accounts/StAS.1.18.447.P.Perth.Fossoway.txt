way, and the other at Tulliebole, were still retained, and the
minister who served the cure, preached two sabbaths at Fossa-
way, and the third at Tulliebole, regularly, and his house was
at Fossaway.  In that year, both the old churches were
thrown down, the manse and glebe at Fossaway were sold;
the present glebe and church-yard, which are situated in the
parish of Tulliebole, were purchased; and a new church and
manse were built, in a situation more centrical to both pa-
rishes, and more convenient for the incumbent.

   Ministers Names an Record.-The first found on the Session
Register (1609), is Mr Laurence Mercer.  It appears that
he was alive in the year 1634.  From that period, there is
a deficiency in the register.  The next mentioned is Mr Alex-
ander Ireland, in the year 1661.  He was alive, in 1687.
Then the register is again deficient.  It cannot therefore be
ascertained, in what years these clergymen were ordained, or
when they died.  It is evident, however, that they were
both of the Episcopal church, belonged to the Diocese of
Dumblane, were strict observers of church discipline, and
were exceedingly attentive to every part of their Parochial
duty.  Sessional business is recorded at considerable length;
public worship is mentioned as regularly performed, and the
collections for the poor, which were made every sabbath-day,
are distinctly marked.  During their incumbencies, the pa-
rish was seldom without divine service on the Lord's day;
almost never without having a reason assigned in the record;
such as, that the minister was assisting his brethren, or was
unable to officiate.  With regard to Mr Ireland, besides such
reasons as these, there are other four mentioned somewhat
singular.  It is said in the register,
   "No sermon; because the minister was at the consecration
"in Edinburgh."
