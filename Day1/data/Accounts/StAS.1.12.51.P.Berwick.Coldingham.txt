     Of Coldingham.

   Some years prior to 1760, a few individuals, of more than
ordinary penetration and discernment, having discovered the
mighty effects of lime in Northumberland, they ventured to
make experiments of its effects upon the lands in Berwickshire;
and from their exertions and success, a spirit of improvement
became general: and in consequence of the great demand for
lime, additional lime-kilns were erected, both upon this, and
on the other side of Berwick, and the great quantities pro-
duced from them, as well as what was brought in ships from
Sunderland, and landed at Eyemouth, have been truly amaz-
ing.  Our farming heritors and freeholders above alluded to,
in this parish, soon began and carried on the improvements
of their several possessions, with equal spirit and success.  Their
soon discovered the inefficacy and impropriety of their former
mode of cropping, and relinquished it unanimously; and, in
place thereof, adopted a quite new and different system.  They
began it by fallowing and cleaning all their old infield, and
then sowing upon it barley or oats, and red and white clover,
with a small mixture of rye-grass; some of them did, and o-
thers did not lay their muck upon that fallow: because Old
infield, even when it appears to be worn out and wasted by
corn crops, will produce luxuriant crops of clover and rye-
grass, without manure; and so it happened with those im-
provers.  They did not even bestow any lime upon that old
infield fallow, as lime has been found to have little effect up-
on old infield; and it only discovers its powers upon fresh
land.  And having thus disposed of their infield, by laying

horses, black cattle, and sheep, was the poor grass upon the two-thirds of out-
field ley, and the meadow and marshay spots in the farm in the summer and au-
tumn, and dry straw in winter and spring.  The poor condition in which these
animals appeared, in the months of March and April every year, demonstrated
the scarcity and poor quality of their food.  They were small, lean, and very
weak.
