hedges and hedge-rows.  The frequent inundations of the
Isla, which sometimes rises suddenly in harvest to a great
height, is often attended with great disappointment and loss
to the husbandman.  This was the case in 1789, and two or
three instances more fatal have happened within these twenty
years.  These might serve as lessons to the tenants to drag
their corns out of the water mark immediately when they are
cut down, a practice too much neglected by them.  Much of
this mischief, arising from the present winding course of the
Isla in its way through the valley, might be prevented by
straightening its channel.

   The tract of land towards the hills is equally fertile, and in
most seasons produces heavy crops of corn and grass.  Its fine
exposure, lying opposite to the genial rays of the sun, is friend-
ly to the quality of the grain, and its early ripening.  Tbe 
corns are seldom hurt by frosts, to which the low ground is
more subject.-Crops of flax in the whole of this district are
generally good, and the quantity sown has greatly increased.
Three, and often four stones of flax, at the rate of 24 lib.
avoirdupois to the stone, is no uncommon return after the peck
of feed.  There are three lint mills in this district, and all
well employed.  The farmers rear a considerable number of
young cattle, and use turnips in this way more than in feed-
ing cattle.  They likewise rear a few horses, but not in suffici-
ent numbers to serve themselves.

   The farms are not too large, nor do they seem to be too high
rented; none of them exceeding L. 140; and there are some
small possessions, at L. 20 and L. 15.  Good ground gives from
15 s. to 21 s. an acre.  Marle is the manure commonly used, of 
which there is plenty, and of the best quality, at the distance
of three or four miles.  Considerable quantities of lime are
brought from Dundee, the nearest sea port town.  Its supe-
