of the poor, nor any thing uncommon done by the session,
except towards the end.  The common distribution of the
collections of the church, amounted only to about 1 s. 2 d.
or 1 s. 4 d. weekly.  The thing most remarkable was, that
for several years before the famine, adultery and fornication
had been extremely frequent, to which the famine put
an entire and speedy stop.-Neither do these crimes seem to
have abounded so much in the parish, since that time.  Soon
after the Reformation, Popery in its outward form seems to
have left the parish entirely, but the superstition as to wells,
spells, charms, remained much longer; and above all, a dis-
regard to the decent religious observation of Sunday.  The
east and west side of the parish continued their competition

Aberdeen, die Sabbathi is expressly inserted.  This practice
was only got gradually suppressed in the beginning of this
century or end of the last.  Some people, whom the incum-
bent has seen, remembered the sale of oxen-yokes, snuff, etc.
upon the Sunday.  The last parcel of snuff brought into the

be held ad Festum Omnium Sanctorum ad All Hallomes per
Spatium octo dierum.  By Bishop Elphingston's charter, in
