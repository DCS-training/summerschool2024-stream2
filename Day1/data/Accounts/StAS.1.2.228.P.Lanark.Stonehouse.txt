kept by the treasurer for the poor.  But this will not be found
quite satisfactory; because some, who reside in this pa-
rish, bury in another, and consequently get a mortcloth from
them; while strangers, sometimes, bury in this; and, suppo-
sing these to be equal, which it is probable they are, the mat-
ter will be uncertain, because mortcloths are seldom required
for children under two years of age.  As it stands, the an-
nual average for these last twenty years, will be found to be
17 and 10/4.

   Marriages.-There is no authentic register of marriages.
A list of proclamations, in order to marriage, is kept, both by
the precentor and treasurer for the poor.  These two have
been compared, and found to agree.  According to them,
there have been, of proclamations, from the beginning of the
year 1761, to the end of the year 1790, in all, 289:  Of these
7 must be discounted, because the marriages did not take place.
Of the remaining 282, in 133 instances, both parties resided
in the parish;-in 75, the man resided, but not the woman;
and in 71, the woman resided, but not the man.  These
facts being ascertained, every person will be able to strike an
annual average, according as his views are, in making the in-
quiry.

   Dissenters.-It is not easy to ascertain the precise number of
dissenters from the Established Church, principally, because
many scarcely know to what particular sect they belong.  Such
heads of families, as have come to a determination on this
point, are as under:
