     of Lanark.

   Such being the case, and as in Lanarkshire there are no
Welsh words in use, except such as are in common with
the Gaelic, we may venture to affirm that the Stratclyde
kingdom of Cumbric Britons is a mere dream; and that
to derive our proper names from the Cumbric is idle.
Indeed we cannot resort to the Welsh language for the
etymon of Lanark, seeing we have a Lanark in Stirling-
shire, where no Cumbric Britons were ever settled; and a
Drum-Lanark and Lanarkland in Dumfriesshire, also
without the bounds of the fabulous Stratclyde kingdom.
   Lanark, or as locally pronounced Lanerick, or Lande-
rick, is therefore more probably Gaelic.  Lan, in Shaw's
dictionary, signifies land, a house, repository, or a
church.  Dearc is the Gaelic for the Billberry, or Blae-
berry, so common on high and dry grounds.  Landerick,
or Lan na dearca, appears therefore to denote the land,
house, repository, or church of the BiIlberries.  Lan
dearcach signifies also Billberry land or repository, pretty
descriptive of all the Lanarks.  But farther, Lan are
signifies a full ark, or granary, and Lanark is spelt Lan-
arc in the old charters, so Lan are may be the true ety-
mon.  These etymons, though probable, may not be
just, yet are less liable to objection than any former one;
nor would we have dwelt so long upon this article, had
we not wished to remove the mist attempted to be
thrown, by the author above-mentioned, over the histo-
ry of Clydesdale.
   All the other names of the parish are Anglo-saxon, un-
less we except Cartlane, Baronald or Baronel, Nemphlar,

chest. cisde, (the C sounding like K in Gaelic,) and Kistie, the diminutive
of Kist, Cistag.  Indeed the Gaelic diminutives are very common in the
lower parts of Clydesdale, as Jamock for little James; Willock, etc.
