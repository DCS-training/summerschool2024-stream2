with few exceptions, they are, and long have been, industri-
ous, honest, neighbourly, sober, and humane; peaceable, or-
derly, and affectionately attached to the free and glorious
constitution of Britain; decent in observing the ordinances
of religion, and rationally impressed with the great end of
them all, as aiding and subservient to piety of heart, upright-
ness of conduct, and purity of life.  If some of them be still
too much given to frets, or superstitious remarks, they are
commonly of the harmless kind.

   Inoculation.-One thing, however, truly to be lamented, is
their yet too great dislike to inoculation for the small-pox,
the neglect of which, though it is in use rather more than it
was, makes this very infectious and virulent disease frequent-
ly mortal; and it is the more difficult to overcome so unfor-
tunate a prejudice, as, in a great degree, it has its origin in
conscience, however erroneous and misinformed.  But, it is
to be hoped, both for the sake of their children, and as an
expression of their thankfulness to God for so gracious a dis-
covery, that they and others around them, for they are not
singular, will soon see this matter in another and juster light,
and chearfully, with a dependence on success from Heaven,
embrace the benefit of so kind a mean afforded by Providence.
They are, in general, much disposed to chearfulness and con-
tentment, but keenly alive to a sense of injustice, rigorous
exactions, or any species of oppression whatever.  That they
have a martial genius, there is little doubt; but our ordinary
wars, it appears, do not call it forth; for they are not fond of
a military life; Indeed, the business of a soldier is held rather
in low estimation among them.  They seem to consider it as
poor, dissipated, and slavish.  As to size, strength, com-
plexion, abilities, or any other personal or mental qualifica-
tion, there is here nothing remarkable.
