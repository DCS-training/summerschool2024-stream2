wages and board, with two horses kept for the purpose,
must be a considerable loser.  It was an unlucky circum-
stance, in assigning land to ministers, that the Legislature
did not think of allotting more.  20 or 25 acres might
have been managed with very little additional expense.
The Crown is patron.  The manse was built in 1737, and
was repaired in 1785.  The time at which the church was
built is not known; it got a repair a good many years
ago.-The schoolmaster's salary is L. 5.  Number of scho-
lars, from 20 to 30, at 1 s. 3 d. the quarter, for 3 quarters
of the year.  The fees are L. 4: 13: 9; fees for registra-
tion of baptisms and marriages, and salary as session-clerk,
L. 2 8: 4.  The amount of the whole is L. 12: 2: 1; a
sum less by L. 2 Sterling than the income of a common la-
bourer.-The number of poor is 7.  The annual contribu-
tions are about L. 13, 16 s.  There are some seats in the
church belonging to the poor, which yield L. 2, 12 s. year-
ly.  Interest of money, about L. 2, 8 s. In all, L. 18, 16 s.*.

*The price of meat, 4o years ago, may be rated at 1 d. the pound.
Now all kinds of butcher meat, of the best quality, fetch from 3 1/2 d. to 4 d.
the pound. Hens were then 4 d. and now about 1 s. and other poultry
in the same proportion.  Butter, 40 years ago, was 4 d the pound; now
it fetches from 7 1/2 d. to 10 d. Cheese, I presume, was not sold by weight
at the distance of 40 years but was then proportionably low; now it sells
from 5 s. to 6 s. the stone, the stone consisting of 24 English pounds.
Wheat is now from 18 s. to L. 1, 7 s.; bear, from 10 s. to L. 1.  These
highest prices of wheat and barley have not been paid for many years,
except in 1782.  The usual price of barley and oat-meal is from
12 s. to 16 s.  Forty years ago, grain was in general from 3 s. to 5 s.
cheaper-Wages, without board, for a day-labourer, are 1 s or 1 s. 1 d.;
a carpenter.  1 s. 4 d.; tailor, 1 s. 1 d.; bricklayer and mason.  1 s. 6 d. or
1 s. 8 d.-The fuel generally made use of is peat.  Gentlemen use coal
in then families; it is also part of the fuel in some farm-houses.  Many
burn nothing but peat, broom, and furze.  We are under the necessity of
resorting for peat to a neighbouring parish at the distance of about
English miles from a great part of this district.  Any moss we have in
