                          PARISH OF LIVINGSTONE.

           PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEDDALE,

                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Extent, &c.-THE length of the parish is between 4 and 5 miles
from west to east, and it is nearly 1 1/2 mile in breadth at each end,
but contracts in the middle to about half a mile. It contains
4463 Scotch acres. It is bounded on the north-west by Bath-
gate and Ecclesmachan; on the east, by Uphall and Mid-Calder;
on the south-east, by Mid-Calder; south, by West Calder, from
which two parishes it is separated by the Ammon and the Briech
waters; and, on the west, by Whitburn.
   Topographical Appearances.-The surface of the parish, though
much varied, does not rise into any very distinct eminence, except
one in the north-east corner, in the lands of Knightsridge, called
Dechmont Law, or Knightsridge Hill. Though only 686 feet
above the level of the sea, it commands a very extensive prospect.
The climate, though rather moist, is favourable to health.
   The Ammon (which rises in the upper parts of Lanarkshire.
