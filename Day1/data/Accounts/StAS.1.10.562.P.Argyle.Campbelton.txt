commonly the case.

   Improvements.-Although the people may be said to have
the means of happiness, in some measure, within their reach,
yet the interests of the parish would be obviously promoted,
if some of the lower grounds were inclosed, and if the high-
er were stocked with sheep.  As they require an extensive
range, the hilly parts of several contiguous farms might be
occupied by a joint stock, in which every farm might have
an interest, in proportion to its share in the bounds.  The
profits of such a stock would go much farther to pay the
rents, than any other produce which may be derived from a
mountainous country; more meat would be brought to mar-
ket, and the wool would be at hand for manufacture and
employment.  But God forbid! that the people, as in other
places, should be obliged to remove in order to make room
for sheep.  The principal proprietor of this country has hap-
pily discovered all along a marked aversion to remove his
people, and often refused the higher offers of the few, for pos-
sessions held at inferior rents by the many.  In all the pe-
ninsula of Kintyre, there is but one considerable sheep stock,
and that on a mountain incapable for cultivation.  The op-
posite system, which has been carried to such an extreme
in the Highlands, is perhaps as adverse to the interests of
the proprietor, as it is detrimental to the kingdom at large.
To the latter it is an obvious and irresparable loss, to banish
that hardy race of men, by whom its battles have been so
often fought*, and its fleets so often manned.  To the
proprietor, too; it is an obvious disadvantage, to have his
