     Statistical Account

   There are three burying grounds in Old Machar, the
church-yard, the Spittal-burying ground, belonging to
Alexander Moir, Esq; of Scotstown, and the Snow church-
yard, belonging to the King's College.  Of the burials in
the two first, tolerably correct registers are kept.  Of the
burials in the last, no accurate account can be had, but by
searching the accounts of the common procurator of the
College, by whom I am informed, that the average num-
ber of burials in it does hot exceed two in a year.  This
burying ground is used chiefly by Papists.  I could find no
register of burials for the Spittal during the two first pe-
riods mentioned in the tables; I have therefore inserted for
these periods only the burials in the parish church-yard,
and those in the Snow church-yard in a single column, en-
titled, Sex unknown.  The number of burials for the Spit-
tal church-yard may, however, be ascertained and inserted
in the blank tables, by calculating from the proportion of
the average burials in the church-yard to that of the Spittal
burying-ground during the last ten years, and in this manner
the average number of the whole burials in the parish for
the first two periods may be found.  In all the registers of
burials some instances occurred in which the sex of the per-
son buried was not ascertained; in these cases, either the
firname only of the person buried was mentioned, or the
keeper of the register charged himself for the buriallair(grave)
of a child, without mentioning whether it was male or female.
To ascertain with any tolerable degree of accuracy the pro-
portion of the sexes buried in the parish, I was therefore
obliged to insert in the tables of burials, in distinct columns,
the numbers in which the registers mentioned the sex; and
to show the whole number, I have added a third column,
entitled, Sex unknown.  I have only to observe farther
with regard to the burials, that many who die in this parish
are buried in other parishes; but that a far greater number
