miles.  Its greatest breadth from S. to N. is about 4 1/4
miles.  At an average it may be about 4 by 3 miles,
The whole parish having been measured, either for the di-
vision of run-rig lands, or for being let by the acre, is
known to contain nearly 6700 acres*.

     Surface, Soil, and Climate.-The surface is much varied.
One of the Eildon hills, and one half of another, are in
this parish.  From one broad and elevated base, three co-
nical tops arise, which, from their situation in a flat coun-
try, more than from their height, are seen at a great di-
stance.  Some parts of them also being covered with a
kind of red stone, without a pile of grass, have a singular
and striking appearance.  Several little eminences and
ridges run from W. to E. with small vallies of fine mea-
dow between them, all abounding with springs of water,
which, when collected, run into Tweed, about two miles to
the eastward of this parish, except one or two streamlets
which fall into Ale water, its southern boundary.  In ge-
neral, the whole parish is naturally grassy, except about
200 acres, including the higher parts of these ridges, which
are inclined to broom or furze, and about the same quan-
tity bearing a kind of stunted heath.  About 3-4ths of the
parish have been, at one time or another, under the plough.
The other 1-4th consists of bog, moss, and plantations of
fir and forest trees.  Of these last there are too few, espe-
cially as they are profitable to the proprietor, as well as to
the farmer, for shelter, and to the people for fuel.  There
is some old wood, but of no great extent.  Two-thirds of
the parish are inclosed mostly with ditch and hedges of

more than the Linlithgow standard.
