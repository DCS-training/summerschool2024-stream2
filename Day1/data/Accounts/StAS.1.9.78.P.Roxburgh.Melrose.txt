sected by Tweed runniug through it in a serpentine direc-
tion, and surrounded by hills of a considerable height.  In
this valley, besides Melrose, are the villages of Danieltoun,
Darnick, Bridge-end, Gattonside, and Newstead, most of
the inhabitants of which hold their possessions in feu, as do
also the inhabitants of Eildon and Newtown, two villages
farther down the river, and of Blainslie, a village on the
west side of Leader, at the north extremity of the parish.

   Soil, Agruculture, and Produce.-The soil is various.
The south end of the parish is mostly a strong clay, excel-
lently adapted for wheat.  The banks of the Tweed are a
fine light dry soil, fit for all kinds of grain.  On the north
side of the Tweed, the soil is of three kinds: 1st, A light
earth, mixed with sand, upon a gravelly bottom; 2dly, A
strong clay upon a till, full of springs, and very wet;
3dly, Moss.  For about 5 miles square, the north part of
the parish is hilly, and makes excellent sheep pasture, in-
terspersed with a few small fields of corn.  For its improve-

should make large strips of plantations, inclosed with
stone fences, both to shelter the land, and to consume the
surface stones which encumber it, and that the additional
rent would amply compensate the trouble and expence.
   Within these 30 years, the farmers have made vast pro-
gress in agriculture.  Through their unremitting industry, a
great quantity of ground, formerly covered with heath,
broom, and furze, has been bared, and now produces excel-
lent crops, or is converted into good pasture.  The value
of land has consequently very much increased.  A feu of
several acres, purchased about 40 years ago at L. 10, was
lately sold at the advanced price of L. 150 Sterling.-The
parish is supposed to produce double the quantity of grain
that it did about that time.  The manure employed is
