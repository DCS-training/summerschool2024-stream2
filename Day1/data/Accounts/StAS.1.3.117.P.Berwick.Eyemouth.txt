very cargo, and get substances to load or unloed, and there-
after to go back again for cockets and clearances, which is at-
tended with much dangerous delay, and no small expence.

   Diseases.-The air here is reckoned healthy.  We are not
assisted with any infectious or epidemical diseases, except the
small-pox, the bad effects of which have of late been pre-
vented by inoculation.  The only complaints that prove mor-
tal in this place, are different kinds of fevers and consumptions;
and these are mostly confined to the poorest class of peope,
and ascribed to their scanty diet.

   Population.-At present, there are about 1000 souls in the
parish.  In Dr Webster's Report, the number is 792.

   Church.-The stipend is partly victual and money, and arises
partly from teinds of fishes, which being so variable, cannot
well be estimated.  The glebe consists of about ten acres of good
land, and may be estimated at fifteen guineas yearly.  The
manse and church are in bad repair.  There are no Papists
nor Episcopals in the parish, and only ten or twelve Seceders.

   Prices of labour.-The wages of wrights and masons are
from 1 s. 4 d. to 1 s. 8 d. a day; of labuorers, from 10 d. to
1 s.; labouring servants within the house from L. 6 to L. 7-
per annum; a maid-servant receives about 30 s. the half
year.
