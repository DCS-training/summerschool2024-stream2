meal is needed for the support of the inhabitants, and the
bear made into bear and whisky.  The times of sowing and
reaping are variable, as the season answers.  The harvest in
Cromar, and particularly about Tarland, is generally as early as
in any corner of the county of Aberdeen.-Some of the farmers
in the parish pay from L. 40 to L. 50 ster. of rent; others from L. 30
to L. 40; and some not above L. 20 or L. 25, including mo-
ney, farm meal and bear, cess, and other public burdens; and,
when calculated, the single acre may be worth, out-field from
3 s. to 5 s. and in-town from 16 s. to 20 s. and some of it 25 s.
according to the nature of the soil.-In the whole
united parishes of Tarland and Migvy, there are 13 heritors;
of whom, 6 have property in the parish of Tarland, and 7 in
the parish of Migvy: of all these, only 2 in Strathdon reside
within the parish.  The valued rent of Tarland is L. 1806:3:6,
and of Migvy L. 1265: 6: 8 Scotch*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The prices of provisions are various.  Beef, mutton, and pork, from 2 d.
to 4 d. per lb. geese from 2 s. to 25 6 d each; ducks from 6 d. to 10 d. each;
hens the same; chickens from 1 d. to 2 d. each.  Butter, fresh, from 5 d. to
8 d. per lb. of 28 oz.-when salted, from 8 d. to 11 d. Cheese from 4 s. to 6 s.
per stone, 16 lb.  to the stone, and 28 oz. to the lb.  Eggs from 2 d. to 3 d.
per dozen.  Oats from 12 s to 20 s. and bear from 12 s to 24 s per boll, with a
peek to each boll; and when grain of any kind is sold with the straw, by the
uniform practice of the country, the purchaser has the proof, which is the
twentieth part of the stock, and a peck to each boll; these are called the
Charities.  And here it may be observed, that as there are very different
qualities of grain, the selling it by the measure is not at all a fair medium of
commerce; because the same price is exacted for grain that weighs no more
than 18 or 19 stone per boll, as for other grain that that weigh 20 or 22 stone.
-It might be of advantage to the public in general, if a certain weight
was established for the boll, then the purchaser would always have nearly the
same value for his money.-The wages of servants are, men, from L. 1:10
to L. 3.-A woman, from 20 s to 25 s. the half year.-Day laborrers, from
6d. to 8d. and in harvest, 10 d. a day, besides victuals.
