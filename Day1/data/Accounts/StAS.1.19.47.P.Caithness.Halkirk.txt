Field of the Altar.  From all which it appears, that the
revenues of the house, and the number of religious retained

all accounts it was in Mr Abernethy's incumbency, the
only church in what we now call the parish of Halkirk.
Here the said Abernethy performed the functions of his
office, but his dwelling was ast Halkirk.  Once, in a Sab-
bath evening, on his return home from church, he was ac-
