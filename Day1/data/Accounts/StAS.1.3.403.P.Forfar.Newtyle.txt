including his house, croft of land, meal, etc. may be worth
15 l. a sum rather small for the support of a family.  Those
of male servants, are from 7 l. to 10 l. per annum, and of fe-

   Antiquities.-Near the Kirktown of Newtyle are the ruins

There are some traces of a camp at Auchtertyre, about a
quarter of a mile from the Kirktown of Newtyle, where
Montrose's army is said to have taken their station for some
nights, while the Marquis himself lodged at a neighbouring
castle, after burning the house of Newton of Blairgowrie,
then the property of the father of the late Provost Drum-

Seal, on the top of Kinsurney's hill, (a part of the Sidlie
Hills), which serves as a land mark.  From this tower St.
Abbe's head is seen, and some parts of 10 or 11 adjacent

use of as a proper place for kindling fires, to warn this and
the neighbouring counties of the approach of enemies.
