     Of Kilfinan

as it is, for all that can attend; owing to the parish be-
ing so long and narrow, and the roads so bad, all the
people in the extremities, and the old and feeble through-
out the whole, must be content to stay at home.  When
we consider, that, some time ago, the parish was much
more populous, and the church scarcely so well seated,
it is difficult to guess how the congregation could be at
all accommodated; unless we suppose, they did not then
assemble so regularly as now.  Indeed, if we judge from
the proportion which the collections of these times bear
to those of our own time, it favours much the suppo-
sition; besides that we have the testimony of many old
men to confirm the same.  The church stands in need
now of a second repair, which it is to be hoped it will
soon have.  The living is 5 chalders oat meal, Dutch
weight, 8 stone to the boll; 1 chalder barley, Linlith-
gow measure; with 27 L. 15 s. 8 1/2 d. Sterling in money,
including the allowance for communion elements.  Mr.
Lamont of Lamont is patron.  The manse was built in
the year 1746, and has never been a sufficient house.
It has got a partial repair in the year 1781, and stands
now very much in need of another; although it is to
be hoped the heritors will rather build a new one, than
repair so bad a house.  The glebe, including the garden,
area of the manse and office-houses, is 3 acres, 2 roods,
and 12 perches.  Three-fourths of an acre of that are
moss, which the present incumbent has attempted to
drain and improve at considerable expense, but which
he despairs of ever seeing arable*.

whereon stands his manse, church, and glebe.  It would have been much
