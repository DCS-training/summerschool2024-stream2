     Statistical Account

   Fossils.-Coal is found in this parish, as well as in all the
neighbouring country, and still continues to be wrought in the
Duke of Hamilton's property.  But the greatest part of the coal,
consumed here, is brought from the neighbouring parishes, and
is delivered at the town for about 5s per ton.  Thirty years ago,
it was not above half that price.  Lime abounds in the upper
part of the parish; and in one place, has been wrought for a
century past.  In the lime-works are found, bivalvular and
spiral shells, resembling small sea shells; and, in a thin
bed of clay, which is sometimes found above the lime, there are
many of these shells, some of them so minute, as scarcely to
be discerned by the naked eye.  Bits of small petrified sticks
are also found above the lime, so hard as to strike fire; and
yet the component parts so distinctly preserved, that the bark,
the different years growth of the wood, and the pith, can be
easily distinguished.  Free-stone, mostly soft, and of a reddish
colour, abounds almost every where; but in some places it is
white and firm.-The highest land in the sout-west part of the
parish, has a great ridge of whin stone rock.  Iron stone is fre-
quently to be met with; and the water of different springs is
strongly tinctured with the ore of that metal; but none of
these have obtained any great degree of fame in the cure of
diseases.  There are several petrifying or encrusting springs,
issuing from the rocks; which, when they fall upon moss,
make an encrustation around its filaments, and form those fan-
tastic figures which are kept in the cabinets of the curious.
Beds of fullers and potters earth are found in different places;
and, in one part, a very pure yellow ochre, in considerable
quantities.

   Population.-From a minute enumeration of the inhabi-
tants, taken in 1791, it appears, there are 954 families
