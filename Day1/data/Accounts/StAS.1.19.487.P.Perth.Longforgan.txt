     of Longforgan.

   As this is a corn country; as improvements in agriculture,
to an immense extent, have been carrying on within these
30 years; as there is one of the best stone-quarries in Great
Britain in this parish, which employs a great number of
hands; as numbers of buildings have been going on; and
turnpike-roads, with many other public works, there is, of
courses, a great demand for labourers of every description, and
of all ages; even women and children get constant employ-
ment in the fields for near 3-4ths of the year, besides what are
required for the manufactures and different trades.  It is in the
winter months only, that the labouring and industrious poor
run the greatest risk of want.  At that period, therefore,
the heritors are very attentive to the wants of the poor;
and as the village of Longforgan belongs entirely to Castle-
Huntly, during the three winter months, i.e. December,
January, and February, or longer, if the season be severe,
Mr Paterson orders meal to be distributed to the poor on his
estate, one or two pecks per week, or more, according to
their necessities, or as the number and helpless conditions of
their families may require.  By such means the parish of
Longforgan has hitherto been able to support its own poor,
without a rate upon themselves, or a tax upon the benevo-
lence of their neighbours.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, amount-
ed only to 1285; and as the number at present is 1526, con-
sequently there is and increase of 241; of these, 778 are
males, and 748 females.
