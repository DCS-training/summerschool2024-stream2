lands of Rosemount, on the S. W. end of the parish, were
fertilised and beautified, by the skill and attention of the pro-
prietor, who holds them mostly in his own possession.  This
gentleman, distingushed by fortune and public spirit, be-
gan to improve his paternal inheritance, with an ardour
and assiduity, becoming an enlightened and generous mind.
He laid out his fields with taste, surrounded them with
planting, inclosed them with proper fences, and meliorated
a naturally cold, stiff, and clayey soil, with calcareous and
other manure.  The good effects of his improvements
soon appeared, not only on his own property, but also on
that of other proprietors, who laudably imitated the exam-
ple, and, in a short time, similar improvements were made
through the whole parish, which was inclosed, and made ara-
ble ; and the land, which befored that period was let, on an
average, for 2 s. 6 d. per acre, is now let at L. 1, 1 s.  It is
a singular fact, and worthy of remark, that the rental of the
lands of Rosemount, which, at the period above mentioned,
was only L. 70 per annum, and thought to be high, is now
nearly ten times the value ; and about 20 acres of that pro-
perty, which was them let for one pound of butter per acre,
and believed to be a fair rent, is now let at L. 1, 5 s.
From a spirited and well managed husbandry, not only the
value of these lands is thus surprisingly increased, but also
the population ; for, besides a number of labourers from
the neighbourhood, who find constant employment, and
unmarried servants, there are 17 families in separate hou-
ses, with a numerous and healthy progeny, well lodged,
sed and clothed, where formerly there were but 7, every
way poorly accommodated.

ly practised in the parish is this : Every farm is divided in-
to three parts.  Each of these is plowed in its turn for 3
