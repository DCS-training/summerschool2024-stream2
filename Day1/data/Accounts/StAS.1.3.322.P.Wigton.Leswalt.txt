     Statistical Account

4 bolls bear, 12 bushels to the boll.  The valued rent of this
parish is about 3600 pounds Scotch; the real rent L. 2000
Sterling.  There is a school-house near the church, where
the youth are taught for about five months in the year; but
towards the summer season they are generally called off, to
assist their parents in country matters.  There is also a school
at one of the villages; but the perquisites are small, and no
salary has been paid for near 50 years; hence learning must
be at a low ebb.

   Antiquities.-Lochnaw Castle is the only considerable
building in the parish.  It is a very antient edifice, built on
an elevated situation, and seems to have been intended for a 
place of defense in former times.  It was protected on the
south by a deep soffe, the vestiges of which may still be
traced; and on the north by a lake of water, called Lochnaw,
which has been drained, and its bed is now fine meadow and
pasture ground.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are only three heritor;
in this parish, the Earl of Stair, Sir Stair Agnew of Loch-
naw, Baronet, and Robert Vans Agnew, Esq; of Schuchan.
Sir Stair Agnew is the only residing heritor.  It is not easy
to say what the land lets at per acre, as the ground has not
been measured; but the rents have been all doubled during
the present incumbency, and the farmers live better, and have
more elegance in their houses, than formerly.  Mr Vans
Agnew's lands in the neighbourhood of Stranraer, that have
been measured, let at from 15 s. to 42 s. per acre.  There
are above 40 farmers in this parish, who pay above L. to of
yearly rent, and several tenants and subtenants, who pay
near that sum.  There is only one farmer who pays above
L. 100.-There are two villages in the eastern extremity
