   William the Lyon gives a toft and garden in the burgh
of Banff to his chaplain Archibald Douglas, bishop of Mo-
ray, A. D. 1165; and similar gifts are made to him in the
towns of Inverness, Nairn, and Cullen, all royal burghs at
this period.
   King Robert Bruce confirms the privileges of royalty,
and King Robert II. 7th October 1372, also confirms the
same, and such other privileges and liberties as were en-
joyed by the town of Aberdeen.
   These grants were followed by confirmations from King
James VI. and Charles II.

   Municipal government, etc.-The town is governed by
a provost, four bailies and twelve counsellors.  Eight of
the old council are re-elected, and the new counsellors are
chosen annually out of the merchant guild-brethren.
   The annual revenue of the burgh amounts to L. 300
Sterling, arising chiefly from feu-duties, rents of lands,
shore-dues and petty customs.

   Alienation of Lands and Fishings.-Such was the distressed
situation of the burgesses, A. D. 1470, that, having no
power to increase their revenues but by lease alone, the
managers of the town, without fraud, and upon their great
aith, with consent of all and fundry neighbours of Banff, let
out to certain burgesses, for 19 years, the whole of their
salmon-fishings, consisting of 12 nets, for the "infesting
" and fundanation makkin of a perpetual chaplenary*, to
" sing in the Peil-heise+ of the burgh, for our Sovereign
