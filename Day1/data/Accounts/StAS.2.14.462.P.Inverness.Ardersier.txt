         PARISH OF ARDROSSER OR ARDERSIER.

        FRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY.

         THE REV. JOHN MATHESON, MINISTER. *


         I-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name and Boundaries.-THERE are many conjectures and traditions
regarding the etymology of Ardersier, or, as it is variously
written in the records of the Presbytery of Chanonry, to which
it was attached till the year 1773, "Ardersuir, Arthursire;" and
in a map of Moray, from drawings by Sir Robert Gordon of Straloch,
taken in 1640, it is spelt Ardyrsyir. It is pronounced in
Gaelic "Ardnasaor," which may signify " the height of the carpenter;"
tradition having preserved a vague story, that several
carpenters were drowned in the ferry, during the period that the
cathedral of Chanonry was being built. Although this derivation
is plausible, it way reasonably be supposed that the parish had a
name before this, accident befell the craftsmen. So far back as
the year 1226, in a deed of agreement between the Bishops of
Moray and Ross, affecting this parish, and transcribed in the
"Registrum Moraviense," it is written " Ardrosser." This is
probably derived from the Gaelic Ard, high, Ross, a promontory
or peninsula, and iar, west; or the adjunct may be an arbitrary
termination. This interpretation is in consonance with the features
of the parish, which towards its western and northern limits
exhibits a front of verdant hill, at some points 200 feet above the
level of the sea. This hill does not extend to the point of land
which juts into the sea, and which is occupied by Fort-George,
but terminates by a gradual slope within a mile of it, and suggests
the idea that the cape had been washed away by some early inundation.
   The length of the parish, from north-west to south-east, is about
four miles; its breadth upwards of two miles. It is bounded on
the north, by the Moray Frith, whose waters also wash its grace
