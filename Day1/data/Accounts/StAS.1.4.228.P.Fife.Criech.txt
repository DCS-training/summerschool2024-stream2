     Statistical Account

wheat sown in this parish about 30, or even 20 years ago,
there are, at a moderate computation, 10 sown now.  For-
merly too, it was full blacks, and needed to be washed
before it was sent to the mill; now, by the attention paid
to the seed, and the preparing of the ground, good wheat
is produced from 8 to 12 bolls, after 1, without any blacks
at all.  The rents of many farms are doubled, and some
tripled; yet the tenants pay them, ride better horses, wear
finer clothes, and entertain their friends better than be-
fore.  Several tenants in this parish are become proprietors,
by mere success in farming, and have far more general
knowledge too than they had 30 or 20 years ago.  There
is 1 flock of sheep, about 13 score; the wool sells at be-
tween 16 s. and L. 1 the stone.  The farmers have access
to lime, within 10 or 12 miles.  The roads are good, and
without turnpikes.

   Population.-The population of this parish is diminished
one-fifth in the period of these 35 years past; which is ow-
ing, probably, to 1 village being allowed to go to decay,
the union of farms, and the use of two horse ploughs.
