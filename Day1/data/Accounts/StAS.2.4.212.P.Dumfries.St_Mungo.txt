with bacon, and occasionally a piece of beef salted for the winter.
There are frequent instances of unlawful intercourse among the
sexes, which, I regret to say, they too often attempt to justify on
principle. Poaching, save by one or two worthless characters, is
nearly unknown in the parish; but poaching salmon in the river
Annan is practised very generally, and by people of the most respect-
able character, fish not being considered by the people as property.

The rotation generally followed by the tenant is green crop or
plain fallow, barley with grass seed, two years pasturage, and oats.
In some instances, grass is only depastured one year, and two suc-
cessive crops of oats taken; but this is now considered bad farm-
ing, except where the grass is depastured for at least two years.
Leases are of fifteen years; duration. Some proprietors require
caution for the first three years of their leases, and others one
year's rent per advance, to lie in the proprietor's hand at 5 per
cent. until the last year of the lease. This last rystem is now
viewed as oppressive and injudicious. The farm-buildings are in
general good. Draining is carried on to a considerable extent;
and with it subdividing of farms and rearing of fences.
