besides 500 head of black cattle, and 80 sheep.  Part of the
latter are killed for home consumption.  Out of these articles,
and the profits of their fish, they are enabled to pay their
rents.

   Fishing.-Fish of all kinds are caught round the island.  In
the beginning of winter, fishermen come from the North
Country, to fish for the Glasgow market, and continue with
success till May.  In July, the herrings frequent the coast,
when the inhabitants bestow the most unwearied application
to the fishing till the end of November.  It is computed, that
the boats, employed in this fishing, bring into the island no
less than 1000L. a year.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air is very salubrious.  There
is no sultry heat in summer, the air being constantly purified
by land or sea breezes.  People advanced in years, however,
Often complain of coughs and rheumatisms during winter.
These diseases are much owing to the dampness of their houses,
and the scarcity of fuel, to render them warm and comfortable,
which is occasioned by the coal tax.  For many years past, a great
number of children died of the natural small pox.  Parents
are now more reconciled to inoculation, as they find that this
artificial distemper, under the direction of a skilful surgeon,
faves the lives of numbers.  There is a disorder, no less fatal
to children, which seems to be peculiar to this island, as it is
seldom known any where else, called the eight-day sickness.
Infants are seized with it the 8th day after birth, by the fall-
ing down of the jaw, attended with violent convulsions.  No
means have yet been found effectual to remove this disorder.
Much of the cause is ascribed to unskilful midwives*.
