     Statistical Account

between an eighth and ninth part of the whole crop, it is
a wonder that the state of agriculture is even so good as
it is.-The surface of the parish may be estimated to con-
tain about 16,000 acres; little more than 4000 of which
are under tillage; and only 2567 are in crop this year;
1873 in oats; 538 in barley; 76 in pease; 60 in turnip
and potato; about 20 in flax; and between 80 and 90 in
sown grass.  There are 167 ploughs yoked; of which 42
consist of 8 or 10 oxen each.  There are only 3 or 4 two-horse
ploughs, that go without a driver, and 1 two-oxen ploughs.
This is a great saving; and it is astonishing, that 2 horses, or
2 oxen in a plough, are not more generally adopted, consider-
ing the great scarcity and high wages of servants.  The rest of
the ploughs consist of 4 or more horses each, or cattle and
horses yoked together, as those who have small possessions
can afford.  Almost all the farmers, who yoke oxen
ploughs, yoke one or more horse ploughs.  The plough
almost universally used is the plough with curved mould-
board.  There are upwards of 400 carts of one kind or
other; of these only 12 are two-horse draughts, and 6 are
oxen wains.

   There are in this parish 388 oxen, 521 cows, 944 young
cattle, 452 horses, and 2582 sheep, mostly of the black
faced kind, which, by a most unaccountable predilection for
size, (the only property of this breed,) has very generally
banished from the North of Scotland, the small white faced
native breed, which produced a very fine wool, and fine
flavoured mutton.  Some farmers are improving their
breed, by crossing with English rams.  The black cattle
are all of the Scotch breed, and generally of a small size,
being worked too young, which stints their growth, and
they are frequently sold off to the dealers before they arrive
at their full size.  The average price of oxen may be stated
