     Statistical Account

the shore is all rocky; and, from a quarter of a mile eastward,
it is all sandy, till joins the Pettycur harbour, near King-
horn.  Opposite this sandy beach, the sea has made great in-
croachments, within these hundred years, and fill continues
to gain ground.  Near the town, however, the rocks are a
perfect defence.  From these rocks, there is as much sea
weed cut, every two years, as produces about 12 or 15 ton of
kelp.  After gales of easterly and southerly winds, there fre-
quently come on shore, large quantities of tangles and sea
weeds, which are used as manure, and answer well for a season.

   It might be mentioned here, how beneficial the rocks and
shores are to the inhabitants of this place, particularly the
poor, from the large quantities of shell-fish, that may be ga-
thered, of one kind or another, at all seasons; especially cockles,
which abound in the extensive hands between Burntisland and
Kinghorn.  A boy or girl may gather to the value, perhaps, of
3 d or 4 d. in a few hours.  Excellent oysters are also to be had
near the town.  The bed belongs partly to the borough, and
partly to the Earl of Morton.

   Hills.-The most remarkable hill, is that which lies about
half a mile north of the town.  It is very steep, and elevated
between 500 and 600 feet above the level of the sea.  It yields
most excellent pasture in any season; is well watered and shel-
tered, and withal, very extensive.  It would make one of the
finest inclosures in Scotland, particularly for sheep.  Form its
appearance, one would almost be included to believe, it had
undergone some violent commotion, and that the rocks on
each end were incrusted with some thing like volcanic mat-
ter.
   In the same line, to the eastward, there is another very high
hill, called Dunearn, remarkable for having a small loch, or
