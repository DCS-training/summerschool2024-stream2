Schaw's Hospital.-Since the date of the former Statistical Ac-
count, in which all that, (in so far as I know), is important re-
specting the origin and objects of Schaw's Hospital, is admirably
narrated, a new house, of considerable exterior elegance, and very
superior internal accommodation, has been erected. The boys have,
at no period since the commencement of the institution, been under
better control, or enjoyed more real comfort than at the present
time. The duties of the governor and housekeeper are perform-
ed with the most praiseworthy fidelity and prudence. The hospi-
tal, with its grounds, which are kept with care and taste, form a
very attractive feature in the scenery of the parish. The Institu-
tion is under the superintendence of 19 trustees. 24 boys are ad-
missible: and the trustees are authorized to bind them as appren-
tices, or do according to their wisdom, for their benefit, on their
leaving the Institution.
