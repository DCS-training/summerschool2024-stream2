      being well affected to the present Government) were brought to
      straits by their sufferings in the late Rebellion."
         Chief Land-owners.-The chief land-owners are, Lord Rollo;
      Robert Graeme, Esq. of Garvock; John Pitcairns, Esq. of Pit-
      cairns; Lord Airlie; and Alexander Belsbes, Esq. of Invermay.
         The descent of the family of Rollo of Duncruib can be traced
      back in a direct line for a period of 1000 years, and can number
      at least one alliance by marriage with the royal family of France.
      The limits of this work will only permit a reference to a few of
      the names that occur in this long line of ancestry.
         Family of Rollo.-Eric Rollo, the Dane, established himself in
      Normandy about the year 800; a lineal descendant of whom hav-
      ing conquered the country from the Crown of France, and mar-
      ried the King's daughter, became first Duke of Normandy.  Pas-
      sing over several generations of this family, we come to William
      Duke of Normandy, commonly styled the Conqueror, who be-
      came King of England in 1066.  Eric de Rollo, a descendant of
      a collateral branch of the first Duke, accompanied the Conqueror
      to England, in capacity of secretary; a portrait of whom, taken
      in the 98th year of his age, is preserved in Duncruib House.
      Richard de Rollo, a son or grandson of the latter, came to Scot-
      land during the reign of David I., by whom he was graciously re-
      ceived, and who conferred on him houses and lands about Edin-
      burgh and elsewhere.  He then settled in Perthshire, where the
      family, having, obtained successive grants of land from the Crown,
      have remained ever since.
         Parochial Registers.-The first record of session begins 19th
      April 1691.  The register of marriages begins 20th January 1709,
      and is discontinued after October 28th 1714.  The register of
      baptisms begins May 16th 1708, and ends October 23d 1716.
      These registers have been resumed at different dates, but have not
      the appearance of having been accurately kept.  Indeed, the re-
      gister of baptisms cannot be expected to be so, as few of the Dis-
      senters record their baptisms, at least with the parochial clerk.
      Some improvement, however, particularly in the registration of
      banns, has taken place since 1783.
         List of the Ministers of Dunning since the Reformation.-Mr

      Lachlan MiIntosh, ordained October 3, 1716, translated to Er-
      rol March 21, 1725; Mr. Andrew Smyth, ordained May 14,
