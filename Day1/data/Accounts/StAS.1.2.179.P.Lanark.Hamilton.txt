fishery carried on, the populous country lower down the
Clyde, the deepening of the channel for improving the naviga-
tion from the sea to Glasgow, and the manufacturing machi-
nery erected on the river, are supposed to have disturbed and
destroyed the fish; and, by preventing them from getting regu-
larly to their spawning ground, must necessarily have diminish-
ed their numbers.  There is no regular market for any kind
of fish caught here; but of late, some surplus salmon from
the Duke's fishery have been sold, in the plentiful seaton, for
2d. per pound avoirdupois, last year at 3d. and this year at 4d.
In deep still pools, are found a large bivalvular shell-fish,
known here by the name of the horfe muscle.  They are not
used as food, but in some of them are found small pearls' so

ing for.

   The rivers are not navigable here; but in great rains they
swell to a considerable height, and cover a great extent of the
low land; sometimes sweeping away the crops by the violence
of the inundation.  On the 12th of March 1782, in particu-

above the ordinary level of low water.  It overflowed a great
tract of country, and appeared like an arm of the sea.
   There are two bridges over the Clyde in the parish; one of
an old standing, called Bothwel bridge; famous for a skirmish
in the reign of King Charles II. between a body of the Whigs,
and a party of the King's army, in which the former were rou-
ted with a great slaughter.  The other was built immedi-
ately below the influx of Avon, under the authority of an act
of parliament; and was finished in 1780.  Avon has also two
bridges; one on the road through Hamilton towards Carlyle, 
which was built before the 16th century; and strengthened and
enlarged, so as to admit the passage of wheel carriages, abouth the
