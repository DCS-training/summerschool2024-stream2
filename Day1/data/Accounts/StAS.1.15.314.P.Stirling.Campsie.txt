     NUMBER XIX.

     PARISH OF CAMPSIE,

     (PRESBYTERY OF GLASGOW, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR,
     COUNTY OF STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. MR. JAMES LAPSLIE, Minister.

     Situation and Name.

   THE parish of Campsie measures eight English miles in
length, and seven in breadth, following the two great lines of
road which intersect the parish nearly at right angles;
the mean length is about six miles, and the mean breadth six,
containing 36 square miles; and allowing only 400 acres to
every square mile, the amount will be 14400 acres; it con-
tains for plough gates of land, and is valued at 6429 pounds
Scots.^

<FOOTNOTE>

^This parish, previous to the disjunction in the 1649, made a particular
district of country by itself, not a little marked by peculiar manners and cus-
toms.  It was bound on the North, by a range of hills running parallel to the
Strath for near ten miles; on the South, by the river Kelvin, which, in these
days, formed a swamp impassible in winter; on the East, the Gurrel Glen
became another natural barrier; on the West, Craig-Maddie Muir and the
Brawzet Burn separated this district from Srathblane and Baldernock.
