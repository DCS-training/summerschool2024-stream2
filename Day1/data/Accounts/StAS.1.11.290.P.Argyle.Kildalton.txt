church now employed for public worship is at this place;
and the village contains 100 souls.  There is, to the W.
of this place about 2 miles, an island, called Texa; and,
on the N. side, a very good place for anchoring large ships.
The anchoring is opposite to an old chapel, that is about the
middle of the island.  Those who are strangers here, should
keep, if possible, at the distance of a mile from the W. end
of this island, when they are going through the found, between
this and the main island, or when they are obliged to cast
anchor; as there is a ridge of rocks that lie out from the
W. end, until you are on a level with the N. side of this
island.  The E. end of the island is free from rocks, and the best
ground for anchoring is near the shore.  This island is near
2 miles in length, and above 1/2 mile in breadth.  There is
good pasture in this small island; and there is a burying-
place around the chapel, the walls of which are partly
standing.  There are the remains of other 2 or 3 chapels in
this parish; where they were formerly wont to bury those
who were of the popish religion; but the whole inhabitants
of this parish now belong to the Established Church; so that
there are none now buried at these chapels, unless when a
stranger happens to die here, who is of the Roman Catholic
religion.

   Bays and Rocks, etc.-A little to the N. W. of this island,
there is a bay, called the Lowdinas, where many small vessels
may anchor; for it is large, and well sheltered on all sides but
the S. The whole of these anchoring places are very dan-

<FOOTNOTE>

mile from each other, it was an easy matter to prevent small vessels from coming.
to this place; for no vessels that draw above 6 or 7 feet water, can come here
at any time.  It is said that the M'Donalds of Islay lived here about the be-
ginning of the last century.  There are a great many forts and buildings
also within a few miles of this place.
