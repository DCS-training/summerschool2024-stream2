not the one half.  Potatoes, of which every occupier of land
raises some, would seem to be the only real improvement.
Of turnips, sown grass, on inclosed fields, the specimens hi-
therto exhibited, are poor indeed.  Of near 90 farmers, of
one kind or other, 4 pay of rent 50 l. Sterling, and upwards;
most of them less than 20 l. and many less than 10 l. there
are not above six or seven who can be said to have attempted
any improvement.  It must be acknowledged, that some of
the proprietors, particularly Mr Baxter of Glassel, and Sir
Robert Burnett of Leys; also, Mr Russel in the near neigh-
bourhood, have done, and are doing much in this respect;
but examples set by gentlemen, of inclosing and dressing
fields, appear not to be minded by ordinary farmers, who by
inability, and the short duration of their leases, cannot be ex-
pected to imitate.  If ever this part of the country is impro-
ved, it must be by the heritors themselves, or by their pitch-
ing on farmers of good character, who possess judgment, spi-
rit, and means for it, and affording them such encourage-
ments as prudence and good sense may direct, as may induce.
them to leave the old tract.  In this way, and by examples
set by such, much might be accomplished, at a small expence
to the landholders, if accompanied with leases of at least two
19 years-the conversion of mill multures, and almost all
kind of services-enforcing winter herding-and fixing pro-
per plans of inclosing and croping.  There is plenty of lime-
stone on both sides the river Dee, near the middle of the pa-
rish, of an inferior quality indeed, but found very useful for
building, as well as for manure.  It is of late years much em-
ployed, and a great proportion of it burnt with English coals;
which, considering the high price of that article, and unequal
tax on it when brought near to this district, and 18 miles
land carriage, is no bad proof of the spirit and industry of
the people.
