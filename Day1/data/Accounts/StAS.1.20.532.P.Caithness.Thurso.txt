     Statistical Account

Sutherland, lately deceased, was at some paints to collect
Robert Donn's works, and commit them to writing, with
a design to have them published.  The manuscript, was
lately laid before the Highland Society of Edinburgh, un-
der whose patronage, they will soon, it is hoped, be given
to the public.
   There is a gentleman of the same name, (Mackay), a native
of Thurso, and residing in that town, who possesses a good deal
of poetical fancy, and has given some proofs of his talents in
that line, by no means amiss.  He is Adjutant to the Thur-
so Volunteers, and as a specimen of his poetical abilities,
the copy of a song, which he composed on that corps, is in-
serted in a note*.

     *THE THURSO VOLUNTEERS.

     
     WHERE foaming surges sweep the shore,
       And swelling billows rise;
     Where rude Boreas makes them roar,
       And mingle with the skies;
     To shield us from sedition's thrall,
       Our loyalty to prove,
     We rise at once at Freedom's call,
       In unity and love.

     
              While for our glorious liberty
                Each noble soul appears,
             Here, in the North, her guard shall be
               The THURSO VOLUNTEERS.

     
     Let sons of Sloth and Discord fret,
       Because despis'd and poor,
     And for misfortunes blame the State,
       Which they themselves procure;
     May all those traitors, who conspire
       To turn our laws like France,
     Be found, and banish'd for their hire,
       Or in a halter dance.
