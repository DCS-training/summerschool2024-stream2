wrought, to considerable extent, for many years past, and
the work is still carrying on.  This coal consists of 3 or 4
seams; a great deal of the parish, and the adjacent places, are
supplied from it, and a considerable qauntity is exported.
The fire engine at these coal works, is the second that was
built in Scotland.

   Ferries.-There are two well known and much frequented
ferries in the parist, viz. the ferries of Kerfie and Higgin's
Neuck.  The former is about half a mile in breadth.  The
proprietor, John Francis Erskine, Esq; of Mar, lately built
a pier upon each side of the river, which renders it commo-
dious for passengers, and all kinds of carriages, with or with-
out horses, either at high or low water.  The latter, viz.
Higgin's Neuck is about a mile in breadth.  There is a pas-
sage boat once a day, from Airth and Dunmore to Alva, and
the places opposite; its time of departure varies according to
the tide.  There are three harbours, viz. Airth, Dunmore,
and Newmiln, all of which are within the precints of the
customhouse at Alloa.  At each of them vessels are occa-
sionally built.

   Wood.-There is wood of considerable extent upon the
Hill of Dunmore, which consists of birch, oak, ash, elm,
beech, and fir.  On the side of the hill, contiguous to the
moss, upwards of 40 acres have lately been planted with oaks
and sirs, most of which are at present in a very thriving con-
dition.  There are a great number of fallow trees planted 
about many farmers houses, and interspresed through the
fields, which add greatly to the beauty of the country.
