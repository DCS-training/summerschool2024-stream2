     ISLAND AND PARISH OF SHAPINSHAY.

     (COUNTY OF ORKNEY AND ZETLAND.-PRESBYTERY
     OF NORTH ISLES.-SYNOD OF ORKNEY.)

     By the Rev. Mr GEORGE BARRY, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

<UNREADABLE>

   FROM whence the name of this parish has been derived,
cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.
There is, however, no improbability in suppposing it to come
from the word ay or ey, which, in the Norse or Norwegian
language, is said to signify an???, and the name of that
animal to which we are indebted for so considerable a part of
our food and clothing The animal here alluded to is the
sheep, for the breeding and pasturing of which the island
has been reckoned rather remarkable, and therefore it has
been, with some propriety, stiled Shapinsbay or the sheep-
Island.  But with more probability still, it may perhaps be
derived from the Saxon language.  If we may credit the
poet Claudian, the Saxons early inhabited this country, and
had even the misfortune to bedew it with their blood. "Ma-
"duerunt Saxone fuso Orcades."  Among that people sha or
shaw signified a valley, and such an one too as lies near the
middle of the island in question; and from the combination
of the name sheep with this word, the whole parish may
have got the name of the Sheep Valley, or Shapinshay.  But
