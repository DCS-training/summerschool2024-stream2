the "Hills of Dunipace," where the burying-ground belonging to
the parish, still is. It was a very plain building, with galleries in
front and ends, affording accommodation for 350 sitters. The
date of its erection is unknown. From several appearances of
arches in its walls, it probably had originally several aisles attached
to it. Its stability was not called in question, till two or three
years before its removal, when a masou was employed to insert in
its front wall, a marble tablet to the memory of William Simpson,
Esq. who left, as above stated, L. 500 to the poor of the parish

   The New Church.-This church stands a mile and a half to the
westward of the old church, on the top of one of these little knolls
with which, as was formerly noticed, this district abounds. Its si-

tower, in which there is a very good bell. It is seated for 604 in-
dividuals, and cost L. 2500. It was opened for public -worship on
Sunday the 29th of June 1834.
  Stipend.-The parishes of Dunipace and Larbert, being under
the pastoral superintendence of one minister, his stipend is allo.
cated from the teinds of both parishes. The stipend, as fixed by
the Court of Teinds in 1823, the period of the last augmentation
is 8 1/2 chalders of barley and 18 1/2 chalders of oatmeal, at the fiat
prices of the county, with L. 16, 13s. 4d. for communion elements.
The manse was lately repaired at the mutual expense of both pa-
rishes. These repairs cost L.660. At the manse, which stands
in the parish of Larbert, there is a good glebe, the common pro-
perty of both parishes, and there is another glebe belonging to the
parish of Dunipace, worth at least L. 10 per annum. The Crown
