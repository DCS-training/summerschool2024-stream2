got a few soon after he was elected, and has room for a great-
er number.  The number of scholars in the winter is from
80 to 100.  The school fees are as low as any in Scotland.
Every man who is sensible of the importance of educating the
youth, and understands the true interests of his country, must
regret, that a body of men so respectable, and so extensively
useful as the parish-schoolmasters are, should have appoint-
ments so very unequal to their labour and to the situation of
their families.
   The poor in this parish art supported in their own houses.
The Kirk Session are enabled to provide for them by the
weekly collections at the church, and the money arising from
the mort-cloths, which were originally purchased from the
poor's funds; by the rent of 5 acres in the priory of St An-
drews, purchased in the same way; and by the produce of a
few seats in the church, yielding about L. 1 sterling per annum.
I believe there is no fund managed with such care, or ren-
dered so extensively useful, as the little funds in the hands of
the Kirk Sessions of Scotland.  We do not allow any of our
poor to beg, though beggars pour in upon us from the north
and south, in greater numbers than the situations of men in
moderate circumstances can enable them to supply.  There
are laws to prevent this; but of what use are laws, if they
are not put in execution?  We have invariably found that
those who are most unwilling to accept of aid from the pa-
rish, are least easily satisfied, when they have begun to receive
it; whereas, those who modestly intimate their wants and
receive assistance, as soon as their circumstances become less
necessitous, with hearts overflowing with gratitude to
Almighty God, inform us that they are able to support
themselves, and thank the Session for the kindness shewn
them while it was necessary.  Pensioners of this description,
we supply with the greatest satisfaction.
