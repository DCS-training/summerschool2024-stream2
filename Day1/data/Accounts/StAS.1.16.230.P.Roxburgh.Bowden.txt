     NUMBER XI.

     PARISH OF BOWDEN,

     (COUNTRY OF ROXBURGH, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TE-
     VIOTDALE, AND PRESBYTERY OF SELKIRK),

Drawn up by a Friend to Statistical Inquiries, from Ma-
terials chiefly furnished by Mr ANDREW BLAIKIE,
Tenant in Holydean, who has resided 35 Years in that
Parish.

     Name, Boundaries, and Extent.

   IN the charter granted by King David I. to the Abbey
of Selkirk, mention is made of Bothenden, which seems
to favour the conjecture of this parish being named after a
St Bothen or Bodwin, and the scite can still be pointed out
of his tower near the village.  Yet the name may be de-
rived from a den or dean in the bow or curve of a small ri-
vulet, which is descriptive of the place where the church is
said to have once stood. It is bounded on the N. by Mel-
rose parish; on the E. mostly by St Boswells, though
partly also by Langnewton annexed to Ancrum; on the S.
by Lilliesleaf; on the W. by Selkirk; and on the N. W.
