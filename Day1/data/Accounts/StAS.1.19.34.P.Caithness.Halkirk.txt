     Statistical Account

came so general, I am persuaded, that one half of the trou-
ble, of the time, and of the expence, is saved, which was
formerly bestowed on the article of carriage alone.
   Further, the cattle used not many years ago for the pur-
poses of the farm, and carriages of all kinds, were for the
most part horses.  This is still much the practice; yet oxen
are, of late years, more and more used for these purposes,
especially since horses are become so expensive in the rear-
ing, and so dear in the purchase.
   The present state of these articles is as follows:-Ploughs,
312; carts of different sizes, 220; horses, 580; of this
number there are 30 large, or of the Galloway size; the

and many of them sold at 2 or 3 years old.  But most of
those employed in work, etc. are purchased at a dear rate
from other places, especially from the Orkneys, where our
young horses are bought for the purposes of rearing and
sale.  Hence it is, that the very same horses which were
sold by us at very low prices, are sometimes, 2 or 3 years
afterwards, rebought by the same persons, who sold them
before, at three times the original price.  This is surely a
mode of traffick very unfrugal, and much against the inte-
rest of the country.
   Black Cattle.-There is a great number of these reared
in this parish, being well calculated for it, as being fur-
nished with good pasture, both lowland and highland.  But
yet I am persuaded, that the number reared is near one-
third more than it ought to have been, or the parish can
