   The principal bridges are, Bothwell bridge, over the
Clyde, of four arches, which is old, upon a narrow scale,
and is proposed to be rebuilt upon a larger plan, which
will be a great improvement to this part of the country.
There are two bridges over North Calder, on the west cor-

Airdrie.  Three are upon the South Calder; one of them

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-The price of labour
here, as in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, has been within
these seven years considerably advanced.  A principal
ploughman, or man-servant, is from L. 10 to L. 12, with
