to L. 6 per annum; but there is a regular half-yearly assessment for
the poor, amounting to upwards of L. 70 yearly; one half-paid by
the heritors, the other by the tenants. The average number of
poor on the roll is about 18 or 20 persons; the allowance to each
may average 1s. 6d. per week. There is no other regular fund for
support of the poor.
                      MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   It is to be regretted that little attention, till very lately, has
been paid to the planting of wood in the northerly and more
hilly parts of the parish. Plantations, however small, are high
ly ornamental to a country, tend to improve the climate, and af-
ford shelter to the crops as well as to the cattle; and though at
first attended with expense, yet they ultimately become profitable,
especially on waste lands, which are fit for nothing else. Of this,
the following fact is sufficient evidence. About sixty years ago,
upwards of 100 acres of waste and marshy ground, on the estate
of Lord Douglas, were planted chiefly with Scotch firs, inter-
spersed with larch and spruce trees. Part of this plantation has
been cut down, and the produce has been found to yield a great-
er profit, after deducting the expenses of planting and making
fences around it, than the best land of the same extent. Acting
on the same enlightened views, his Lordship has, for some years
past, planted to a considerable extent on his property on the
Lammermoor, which, at no distant period, will prove highly be-
neficial to his estate, and ornamental to the neighbourhood.
