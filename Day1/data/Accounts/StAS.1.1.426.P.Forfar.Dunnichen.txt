soon followed on the other lochs; and, about 30 years ago,
the late Earl of Strathmore, by means of a drain, lowered the
surface of the water of the loch of Fortar, thereby opening a 
still more extensive supply of marl; and, in the year 1790,
Mr Dempster of Dunnichen drained the loch and moss of 
Restineth, by which an inexhaustible mass of shell-marl has
been made accessible.  Marl is sold at 8 d. a boll, contain-
ing 8 solid feet, sixty bolls are commonly used for the first
dressing of an acre of land.  Its qualities are precisely the
same with those of lime Which of these manures is prefe-
rable, has been long a subject of frequent dispute among the 
farmers; but the chemical analysis of marl shows clearly that
marl is in every respect the same with lime, and possesses the 
additional advantage of being found in a pulverised state, and
requiring no calcination previous to laying it on the land.
The similarity of the two has been still farther evinced by Mr
Dempster having constructed a kiln on a plan suggested by
Dr Black * for calcining marl, which, after calcination,

*The construction of the kiln, and method of calcining the 
marl, will appear from the following extract from a letter of Dr
Black's to George Dempster, Esq; dated 28th November 1789.

   "There is no doubt but that such marl as you describe may
be burned to very good lime, if the proper degree of heat can
be applied to it.  In a country where the only fuel is peat, I
have no hopes of success with the Reverberatory  With such
fuel, in such a furnace, it would be expensive beyond measure,
and perhaps impracticable, to produce the necessary degree of
heat.  Neither is the experiment likely to succeed in a draw-
kiln, in which so much dust and rubbish must be produced by 
the descent of the lime, and attrition of the masses against one
another, that the passages for the air would be too much ob-
structed  But, in a kiln in which the masses of marl would be
little disturbed, the operation might succeed very well.  I would
therefore prepare the marl as the harder kinds of peat are pre-
pared in some places, by laying it, while soft, on a plot of
