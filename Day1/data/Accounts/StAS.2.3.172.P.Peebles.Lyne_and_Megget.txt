                    V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Means of Communication.-There are four miles of turnpike,
roads in the parish. Carriers pass weekly through Lyne, convey-
ing merchandise between Hawick and Glasgow. For some years
during the summer a coach has passed daily between Glasgow and
Kelso, but in the winter it has hitherto been discontinued. There
are two bridge over the stream that separates Lyne from Stobo,
and one over the water of Megget, all of which are in good con-
dition.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The situation of the parish church in
Lyne is as eligible as any that could have been selected. It is
scarcely more than a mile from any of the inhabited houses which
are placed around it. The precise period when it was built is now
unknown, but it exhibits evident proofs of antiquity, and probably
several centuries have elapsed since its erection. About forty
years ago, on the occasion of a repair, as the population had greatly
decreased, its length in the inside was diminished by a partition
wall which was constructed, and was designed to bound the space
intended for seats. It still, however, affords accommodation for
about 80 persons, and at ordinary times 20 more might avail them-
selves of the communion table. In 1830 it underwent a repair,
chiefly in the flooring and seats, and the windows also were neatly
supplied with glass suited to their antique form. All the seats are
free to those by whom they are occupied.
   In 1829 a new and commodious manse was built. It is obvious,
therefore, that the heritors have manifested no disinclination to the
cause of religion, and no repugnance to supply the means of support-
ing it. The chapel in Megget, erected about thirty years ago for the
convenience of public worship, with an apartment in it designed for
a school, was built, not at the expense of the heritors, but with

<FOOTNOTE>The price of sheep, lambs, and wool rose greatly during 1833, and have
surpassed the estimate which has now been given, but it should be remembered
that previously it must often have been below it, and, if there be an excess, it is
doubtful whether it would be more than sufficient to counterbalance the effects of
disease and casualties which yearly occur.
