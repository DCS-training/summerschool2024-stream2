     Statistical Account

By act of the kirk-session, every one who is admitted to be a
constant pensioner must sign a disposition of his effects (if a-
ny; at his or her decease), to the kirk-session, to be given to
the surviving poor.  Since the year 1782, we have few or
rather no beggars.  By the beneficence of the Earl of Bute,
and by other charitable donations, they have not been to ne-
cessitous as they were before the year 1782.

   Servants.-Their wages are advaced of late more than a
third.  Men-servants wages from L. 6 to L. 8 per annum a
women-servants wages are from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum a
day-labourers, have in winter from 6 d. to 8 d. a day, with
their maintenance; in spring and summer from 8 d. to 10d.;
in harvest, women hired by the day have 8 d. a day, and
their dinner; is hired for the whole time of harvest, from
16 s. to 18 s. and their maintenance.  There are no men-
reapers, the corn is all cut down by women; and the men
tie the sheaves and stook them.

   Fish and game.-There are fish of almost every kind on
each side of the parish; but the natives never fish-for any
kind excepting herrings.  Of these they are uncommonly
fond, which prevents them from trying to catch others.
In the spring, when they are not employed at the herring-
fishery, would they apply themselves to the catching of cod
and haddocks, etc. they would surely be gainers.  Fish of the
above kinds are taken by north country strolling fishermen,
and sold of high prices.  Hares, patridges, and snipes, are
in plenty.  There are likewise green and grey plovers; some
winters a great, many woodcocks, abundance of ducks and teel,
with other sea-sowl, which are common to the western shores
of Scotland.
