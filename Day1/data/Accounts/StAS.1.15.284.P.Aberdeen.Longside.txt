the parish.  The remainder are masons, taylors, etc. etc.
Almost all have a few acres of ground, which they cultivate,
at the same time that they pursue their other occupations.
From this circumstance, it may be inferred, that the different
branches of labour above enumerated are still in an unim-
proved state.  Some approaches, however, toward, a regular
division and simplification of labour have been made of late;
particularly at Nether Kinmundy; which will be mentioned
afterwards.
   From an inspection of the register of births, marriages, and
deaths, for 6 years, from the year 1783, it appears that the
average of baptisms, during that period, is 29; that the male
births are to the female as 4 to 3; that the average of pa-
rishioners married in the above period, is only 21; that the
average of burials is 20; that the whole number of inter-
ments, including persons brought from neighbouring parishes,
is 208; whose ages amount to 9444 years; and that of con-
sequence the average of an age is somewhat more than 45.

   Agriculture.-When I say that 100 families and upwards
are employed in farming, or that there are 100 farms in the
parish, it will readily be inferred that many of these farms
must be small:  And when this is the case, it is impossible
that lands can be improved to any considerable extent.  Many
of them are what are called crofts; which do not admit of
the tenants haying a plough.  Two, or three, and sometimes
four, are obliged to join for this purpose: which is, in other
words, saying, that the work is ill-performed, and at a great
expence of time and labour.  No simplification of the differ-
ent branches of agriculture can be accomplished in a very
small scale.  And yet, when this is not done,-when one
man must do 8 or 10 different sorts of work, little knowledge
