   This makes an average of 5854 quarters, annually export-
ed, or carried coastwise.  What is entered for exportation at
Port Patrick is not included in the above abstract.  Potatoes
are cultivated to a great extent through the whole district.
Above 100 tons of them have been exported since the com-
mencement of this year they form a very great and im-
portant article of food, especially to the poor sort of inhabi-
tants; 6 d. or 7 d. per bushel is an average price for expor-
tation.

   Tanning is a considerable trade here.  There are two annual
fairs in the parish; one in the beginning of May, the other in
the beginning of September.  While a friendly connection
subsisted between Great Britain and America, great quantities
of Gallowa plaiding (a course fabric, fitted for the Virginia
market) was fold at the last of these fairs.  This was the
staple manufacture here; and it brought into the country
near L. 3000 annually But the demand for this article cea-
sing at the commencement of hostilities, the trade was aban-
doned.  To it has succeeded the raising of flax in greater
quantities tahn formerly, and working it up into course linens.
