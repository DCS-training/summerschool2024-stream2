     General Appendix to [Vol.xix

   The success with which this stratagem was deservedly
crowned, could not render Montrose forgetful of the perilous
condition of the right wing, and he hastened thither to its
relief with all the men he could collect.  M'Donald, (a man
of the greatest personal intrepidity, but endowed rather with
the qualifications of a mere soldier than of a general, bold even
to rashness,) moved with indignant scorn at the insults of the
enemy, and disdaining to screen himself behind the dykes and
bushes, withdrew from the strong ground, where he was se-
cure from all danger, to face the enemy on the open field.
He had nigh fallen a sacrifice to his rashness.  The Cove-

and many of them experienced soldiers, soon threw his
troops into disorder, and repulsed them in great confusion;
and had he not quickly retired with them into a neighbour-

standard fallen into the power of the enemy.  This rash
mistake, M'Donald abundantly redeemed, by the singular
courage he displayed in bringing off his men.  He himself
was the last man who quitted the field, and alone covered
the retreat of his men; defending his body with a large tar-
get, and opposing himself to the thickest of the enemy: some
soldiers came so near him, as to fix their spears in his target,
which he is said successively to have cut to pieces by a single
stroke of his sword.

in the inclosure, saw Montrose coming to his assistance, and
perceived that their own men on the left were fled, the horse
ran with precipitation; but the foot, principally fresh sol-
diers, fought with the utmost desperation, and fell almost
every man in his rank.  The conquerors continued the chace
for some miles.
   There were slain of the Covenanters about 3000 foot,
