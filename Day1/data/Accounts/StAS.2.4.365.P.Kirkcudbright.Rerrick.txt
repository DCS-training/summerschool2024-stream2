	Principal Seats.--Orchardton, Dundrennan, Orroland, Nether-
law, Balcarry, Collin, Nutwood, and Port Mary. Late in thd
seventeenth century, when Sir Robert Sibbald compiled his De
scription of Scotland, the considerable houses of the parish of
Rerrick are said to have been, " Dundrainnan Abbay, Ba-
locco, Glenshinnock, Orchartoun, and Colnachtyr."* Glen-
shinnoch is generally understood to have been the ancient name
of Orchardton, while Colnachtyr, under the more modern appel-
lation of Conaightry, is now an outlying farm upon the estate of
Mr Murray of Broughton.
