mits of their possessions.  They amount to 50, exclusive of
cottars or cottagers.  Their families consist of about 10 per-
sons each, and this number includes their children, who
when they are grown up, whether they be male or female,
remain with their parents in the capacity of servants.
   In the town the tradesmen are pretty numerous.  The
master weavers are 53, their journeymen 8, and their appren-
