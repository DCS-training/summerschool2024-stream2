   Population.-What the population was, at any former pe-
riod, is not precisely known; but it has certainly, of late, in-
creased considerably.  This is not so much to be ascrined to 
the progress of agriculture, as to a passion that has prevailed

1766, there were only 18 houses in Clayhole, and now there
are about 50.  The man is still alive who built the first house
in it.  The number, in Dr Webster's report, is 652.  The

be about 150 Irish, three English, and one Mulatto.  These
are in general either hired servants or labourers.  The
births during the last 12 months were 28, and the marriages
eight; but there were some irregular marriages.

a grievance that has been long complained of, but hitherto
without redress.

   Church and School, etc.-The stipend is L. 49: 18: 3 1/2 of
money, and 15 bolls of meal, of 16 stone to the boil, and
