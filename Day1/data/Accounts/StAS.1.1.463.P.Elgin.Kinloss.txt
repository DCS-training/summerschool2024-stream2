     of Kinloss.

   Climate and Distempers.-The air is sharp, dry, and heal-
thy.  The most prevalent distempers are cutaneous diseases,
scurvy, and rheumatism; owing, perhaps, to hard labour,
the sharpness of the air, a spare or fish diet, and want of
cleanliness.

   Population.-The amount of the inhabitants of this parish
is 234 families, which contain 1031 persons, being nearly 4 1/2
to each family.  There are 4 heritors, 40 farmers, 56 fisher-
men and sailors, 9 shoemakers, 6 weavers, 6 carpenters and
wrights, 2 taylors, 2 smiths, 2 millers, 2 masons, 2 coopers,
1 merchant, 1 brewer, 1 thread manufacturer, 10 day labour-
ers, and 6 traveling beggars.  Dr Webster's state of the in-
habitants is 1191.  The annual average of births from 1700
to 1720, is 25 males and 21 females; from the beginning
of the year 1779 to the beginning of 1789, is 29.  In this
last period were born 147 males, and 145 females.  The
decrease of population is owing to the spirit of traveling,
and the engrossing of farms.

   Church and Stipend.-The manse was built in 1751; the
church in 1765.  The value of the living is uncertain; a
process of augmentation having been carried on since the year
1781.  The patrons are Lord Moray and Miss Brodie of
Lethen.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no rivers in this pa-
rish but the Findhorn, which runs south and west, and falls
into the Moray Firth at the town of Findhorn.  This river
abounds with salmon, which, in the spring, and beginning of
summer, are boiled at Findhorn, and kitted and sent to the
London market.  Fresh salmon is sold here at 4 d. a pound.
