some kind or other.  To them, if they were better in-
formed, that should not be a disagreeable necessity; for, it
is certain, that, in most places of this island, tradesmen, if
sober and industrious, of almost every denomination, can
live and bring up their families, much more comfortably
than they can do.  Here the tenants are subjected to very
few services, and these few are seldom exacted.  They are
bound, however, to carry their farm victual to whatever
port it is to be shipped at, and to perform kirk and mill
services, as is usual in most parishes.  The multures belong
to the proprietors of the several lands, except in one in-
stance; the small estate of Edinteve being thirled to a mill
of Lord Fife's.  The heritors, however, think proper to
oblige their respective tenants to grind at their own mills,
the multures of which vary; sometimes the 10th, some-
times the 16th part is exacted, which is accounted a great
bar to improvement.  Among these tenants, with the vil-
lage feuers, there are 381 oxen, 523 horses, 645 cows, 990
young cattle, 39 young horses, and 2240 sheep.

in a detached corner of the parish, by a colony from va-
rious districts of the Highlands; who being indigent, and
supported by begging, or their own alertness, are allured
there by the abundance of moss, and the vicinity of a very
populous and plentiful country.  Many instances of the a-
bove mentioned derivations might be given: for example,
Aultmore, signifying 'the great burn, or brook;' Alton-
buy, 'the yellow island;' Bog-bain, 'the white moss;'
Achanacy, 'the field in the muir or desert,' etc; all
