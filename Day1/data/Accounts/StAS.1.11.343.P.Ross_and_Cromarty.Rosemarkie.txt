   From the traditional account of St. Boniface annexed, there
is ground to think, the present parish church had its foundation
laid by him.  In repairing it, anno 1735, in a vault, under
a very ancient steeple, there were found some stone cossins of

with a proportion of the expence of kirk and manse, and
schoolmaster's salary.  This he reckons a hardship; and as
the drawing of the teind from the fields is very troublesome
and disagreeable, for this and other reasons, he has been ob-
