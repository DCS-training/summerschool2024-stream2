                 PARISH OF KIRKGUNZEON.

	       PRESBYTERY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD NF DUMFRIES.

	        THE REV. JOHN CROCKET, MINISTER.

			I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE name of the parish has been spelled differently
at different times. On the kirk bell,which was cast in 1674, it
is named Kirkwinong. It is probable that the church was dedi-
cated to St Winning. There is a spring near to the church which
still bears the name of Winning's well.
	Boundaries, &c.--The parish is bounded on the east by New-
abbey; on the south, by Colvend; on the west, by Urr; and on
the north, by Lochrutton. It is about 5 miles in length, and 3 in
breadth.
	Topographical Appearance.--The general aspect of the pa-
rish is hilly and uneven; but along the banks of the stream which
flows through the middle of the parish, there is a very considera-
ble portion of excellent holm, and meadow land. The hills do
not rise to any considerable height, and abound with grouse and
black game. The river which intersects the parish, takes its rise
from two lochs in the upper end of the parish of Newabbey. The
length of its course is about nine miles. It joins the Urr
about a mile below the village of Dalbeattie. The water abounds
with trout of excellent quality; and salmon find their way up from
the sea in considerable quantities, in the end of the season. I am
afraid that few of them return, as there are some poachers on
the banks who make a trade of killing them by night with leis-
ters. The salmon were much more plentiful at one time than
they are now.
	Mineralogy.--The southern division of the parish abounds with
granite, and some of the rocks are of stupendous size. The pa-
rish supplies the surrounding district with pillars for gates and
steps for stairs, which, when finely polished, have a beautiful ap-
pearance and are remarkably durable. The stones on the west
