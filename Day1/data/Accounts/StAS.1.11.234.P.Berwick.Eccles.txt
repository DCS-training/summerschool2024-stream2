sheep upon such land, as the animals never have a dry bed, and
are often up to the belly in mud and water.  In these places
of the parish where the soil is light, great profits are made by
feeding sheep on turnips.  They are generally let at from 4 L.
to 5 L. the English acre; and the writer hereof has once and
again sold them for 5 guineas.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate of Eccles, from its low
and flat situation, is by no means the most healthy; and from
the marsh miasma, (arising from rain water stagnating on the
surface of a soil, chiefly clay), the people are peculiarly ob-
noxious to diseases of debility, such as agues, nervous fevers,
chronic rheumatisms, &c.  Within these last 20 years, these
diseases were almost epidemic, among the lower classes of the
people.  Of late, however, they are much less frequent, and
greatly milder.  This may be attributed to two causes: 1st,
To the advanced state of agricultural improvement, and espe-
cially draining of land; which, by drawing off the rain water
that formerly stagnated on the surface, has rendered the soil
dryer, and consequently more wholesome; 2dly, To the lower
classes-being more comfortably clothed and lodged, and living
more on animal food than formerly.  That the influence of a
damp climate is corrected by a generous mode of living, is
abundantly evident from this cirumstance, that while the
poorer sort are often visited by the abovementioned diseases,
the gentry and opulent farmers almost always escape.  Among
the causes, which have contributed to lessen the influence of
the diseases peculiar to this climate, there is one, which the
incumbent's personal knowledge of its happy effects will not
allow him to omit; the wearing of FLANNEL next the skin.
Nor is it difficult to account for this effect.  Rheumatism
proceeds evidently from the perspiration being obstructed on
the surface of the body; and nothing but flannel will preserve
