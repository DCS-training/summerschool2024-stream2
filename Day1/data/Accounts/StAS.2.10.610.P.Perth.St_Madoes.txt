pease and potatoes may, with ordinary care be counted on by the
first week of June in the sheltered border. Not only do the more
common fruits cultivated in Scotland, such as the apple, the pear,
and the apricot, come earlx to maturity, but the peach, the nec-
tarine, and the fig, are found to bear abundantly, and to ripen to
high perfection. The Fuchsia, the Passiflora pupurea, and se-
veral varities of the Rosa Indica, may be seen in ordinary sea-
sona, flowering in the open border in the middle of November; and
without any extraordinary protection, these and other exotics even
more tender, are found to survive the winter. Still there are
drawbacks to be mentioned. In the months of April and May,
we are subjected to a hoar or thich vapour with cold nipping
breezes from the east. These prevail for several days at a time,
and should they happen during the period when the fruit-trees be-
gin to expand their blossom, they throw a damp over the hopes
of the orchardist. In autumn and winter again, rime or hoar-frost
is very frequent, and may be seen clothing the trees on the
low grounds with a fantastic though beautiful icy foliage, while to
the braes around it does not extend. On the other hand, however,
snow seldom falls with us but to disappear, suddenly melting away,
so that it is quite a common thing to see the bills and upland
within a mile and a-half, deeply covered with a wintry mantle,
while the plough is busy at work in the plains below.
     By comparing meteorological registers kept here, and the neigh-
bourhood within a range of three miles, and the heights of from 50
to 150 feet above the level of the sea, I have been enabled tn form
the following table, which may be regarded as affoding a pretty
correct account of the average results of meteorological observa-
tions for the last six years. The observations were taken at a
qaurter past nine in the morning, and half-past eight in the even-
ing.

     In the temperature, as wll as the pressure of the atmosphere,
as exhibited by the above table, indications of a genial climate may
readily be perceived. The prevailing winds are from south-west
