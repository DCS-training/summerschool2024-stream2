stition.  The circle consists of sixteen stoner, between Which and
the double circle there is a large stone incumbent, where the arch
Druid stood, and addressed himself to those around him.  The
outer precinct of the concentric circle is 18 yards in circumfe-
rence, in which are forty stones. Three yards north from it, there
is a large standing stone, which is probably monumental of some
illustrious dead, as they were then interrdd around those places,
where they worshipped the Supreme Being.  To the west of this
temple, there is a Si'un, which signifies in Gaelic a mount of
peace, near which is a fairy hillock, where urns have been found,
and which was believed to have been inhabited by an inferior kind
of genii, called fairies.  On the Si'uns, the Druids held assizes,
when it was customary to kindle a large bonfire, called Samhin, or
the fire of peace. On Hallow eve, a Druidical festival, these
fires are still ligbted up, in this district, and retain the same name.
   Modern Buildings.-The House of Abercairney is a superb
modern edifice, in the form of an ancient cathedral, and in the
Gothic style of architecture. Its exterior is much admired for its
lightness, elegance, and symmetry; but it is far surpassed by the
exquisite enrichments of its interior finishing.  The mansion-bouse
of Cultoquhev has also been lately erected. It is a structure of
beautiful and substantial vorkmanship, and graceful proportion, in
the style of the Elizabethan age, from a design of Mr Smirke.

   The population of the parish has of late fluctuated considerably.
By Dr Webster's list it was rated

                         In 1755 at             1706
                         In 1770 it was         1100
                            1794                1224
                            1831                1681

This fluctuation is owing to the erection of the village of Gilmer-
ton, to the quoad sacra part of the parish being included in the
census, and to the extent of modern farms.
