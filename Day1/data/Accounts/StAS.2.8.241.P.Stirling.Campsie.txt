quantity of siliceous matter it contains, possesses peculiar proper-
ties of binding where exposed to the weather, as also of setting in
building under water. The following are its constituents in 100
parts :--

   Coal and limestone are also wrought on the north side of the
valley, but neither of them is of so good quality as are those on the
south side. The coal there is almost wholly used for burning the
limestone, whereas that on the south is used chiefly by the public
works, and for domestic purposes.
   In sinking a bore in search of coal in the strata of the Glazert,
near the alum-works, in 1836, at a depth of about thirteen fa-
thoms, a spring of water was struck, which discharged about 120
gallons per minute at the aperture of the bore, for several months.
It afterwards abated nearly a third of this quantity, but continues
still to discharge about 80 gallons per minute of pure water, at
the temperature of 48&deg;C Fahrenheit. This artesian well now fur-
nishes a plentiful supply to the alum-works afterwards described.

No. 1.--Section of Coal Strata in a Pit put down on the summit
  level of the Ridge, running along the south side of the Strath
  of Campsie, at the height of 450 feet above the bed of the
  River Glazert.*
