veral years.  Some years ago, it was repaired at the ex-
pence of a gentleman, who was cured of a stomach disorder,
by the Spaw water.  This mineral water is nearly of the
same kind with that of Tunbridge, the most celebrated
chalybeate water in England.  Dunse Spaw, according to
the analysis of it, published by Professor Home at Edin-
burgh, 1761, contains iron, sea-salt, a marley earth, and
fixed air, or what is called aerial acid.  Like most other
chalybeate waters, it does not carry well, unless the usual
methods are practised, in transporting the foreign chaly-
beate waters.  Although the water may be thus carried to
a great distance, without losing its properties in a confider-
able degree, yet it must unquestionably be drunk with
greater advantage on the spot.  This water is found very
salutary in complaints of the stomach, weakness of the in-
testines, diabetes, and a great variety of other disorders.
The best months for drinking Dunse Spaw, are June, July,
August, and September, when the valitudinarian, and per-
sons subject to chronic disorders, may, by a course of these
waters, reap every advantage to be procured by any cha-
lybeate water whatever.

   River.-The water of Whitadder abounds in trout, but
of no high flavour, nor rich in quality.  There is also in
this river a larger sort of fish, called a whitling; it is a
large fine trout, from 16 inches to 2 feet long, and well
grown; its flesh is red, and high coloured, like salmon, and
of full as fine a flavour; it is a most delicate fish, and affords
most excellent sport to the angler.  It goes to the sea in its
season, and returns strong, vigorous, and helthy; but if,
from the smallness of the river in a dry season, it is pre-
vented from getting to the sea, it becomes lank, small and
spiritless, and loses its red colour and flavour.  The Whit-
adder falls into the Tweed, about 12 miles E. from Dunse,
