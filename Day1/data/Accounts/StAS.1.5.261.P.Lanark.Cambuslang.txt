   The population, which had been rather retrogade than even
stationary, between January 1775 and May 1783, has,
since the latter period, received an augmentation of 44 fami-
lies, and 200 persons; and this augmentation has arisen,-
1st, from the increase of weavers, since the weaving of muslin
was introduced; 2dly, from the establishment of the cotton-
work at Flemington, which has brought 12 new families to
the parish; and 3dly, from the increase of colliers, since the
erection of the steam engine.
