pound-the one-half payable by the landlord, and the other half
by the tenant.
   The proceeds of the annual assessment for the support of the
poor of the parish is about L. 8000. The funds realised for the
year from Whitsunday 1844 to Whitsunday 1845, including ar-
rears of assessment of preceding years, also L. 1750 received in
compensation for leave of way through part of the new bury-
ing-grounds at the West Church and through the grounds at the
work-house, and L. 600 of arrears of the proceeds of sales of lairs,
&c. in the burying-grounds, amounted to L. 11, 774, 5s. 6 3/4 d.; and
the expenditure for the same period, to L. 10, 234, 17s. 3 3/4 d. As
the sources of extraordinary income, which for some years past
supplemented the deficiency of the ordinary revenue, are now
nearly exhausted; and as the number of the poor is yearly in-
creasing-the increase for the last four years being about 743 pau-
pers-and the additional expenditure on that account about
1, 2400, the heritors find it necessary to impose, for next year,
3d. per pound additional, thus raising the poor's-rate to 1s. 1d.
per pound.
   Work-house.-In the year 1744 the enrolled poor were 220, be-
sides 58 begging poor who were, furnished with badges. The
work-house was erected in 1761, and first opened for the reception
of paupers on 27th May 1762. The number of inmates, the first
year, was 84, and 97 the second year. The work-house was en-
larged at different periods; part of it was appropriated for lunatic
paupers; and in 1837 it contained at one time 539 inmates. Its
size scarcely affording comfortable accommodation for so many,
the number of inmates has for several years past been gradually
reduced. The inmates work at shoemaking, joiner-work, weaving,
sewing, knitting, hair-teasing, and other such employments. The
work-house is well conducted, and the inmates are comfortably
maintained, though the average of each costs only about L. 6 a-
year.
   Attached to the work-house is a school, in which nearly 200
pauper children, inmates of the work-house, are taught reading,
writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, sacred music, and reli-
gious and general knowledge, and attend a Sabbath evening school.
There is also a sewing-school. The school is publicly examined
half-yearly.

office of chaplain; but finding the duties of these three conjoined
