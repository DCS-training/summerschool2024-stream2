     Statistical Account

known and esteemed in most parts of Scotland,) there are
2 fishing boats, each of which requires 6 hands, and 3
smaller ones of yauls, wrought by four men each.  At
Portlethen, about a mile farther S. there are 3 of the larger
boats, and 1 yaul, manned as those of Findon, and at
Dounies, still farther to the southward, there is 1 yaul em-
ployed.  The fishermen at Findon, have each an acre of
land, a house, garden, liberty of fuel, and a right to the
harbour, for L. 3 Sterling annually.  Those at Portlethen
have not a full acre of ground, and on that account pay 5 s.
less of rent.  They fish pretty successfully for skate, ling,
turbot, cod, haddocks, whitings, slounders, crabs, lobsters,
etc.  The vicinity of Aberdeen secures a good price.
Haddocks this season, which has been a bad one for fishing,
have sold from 2 s. to 6 s. the dozen, according to their size.
-Whilst speaking of the coast, a remarkable incident
may be mentioned, of which this parish was the scene.
  On the 19th August 1710, 7 boys, about 15 years of age
each, failed out of the harbour of St Andrew's  in a little
boat, and losing one of their oars, were driven into the
ocean.  After 6 days and 6 nights of continued fashing and 
labour, they got to shore alive, 4 miles south of Aberdeen,
and 50 north of St Andrew's.  A humane country man,
John Shepherd, kindly received them into his house, and
sent information of so moving an accident to the magistrates
of Aberdeen, who dispatched their dean of guild, a physi-
cian, and a surgeon, to attend them.  All of the boys were
preserved in life, except the two youngest, who died soon
after they came ashore.  John Shepherd was presented with
a silver cup in form of a boat, by Robert Bruce goldsmith
in Edinburgh, father of one of the boys, in testimony of
his gratitude for the active part he took in recovering his
son.
