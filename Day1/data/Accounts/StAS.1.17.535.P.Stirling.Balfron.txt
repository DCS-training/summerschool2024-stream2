   Church and Stipend.  Poor.  School.-The manse and offices
were built new from the foundations in 1789, and the church,
which is near, and even elegant, in 1793.  The value of the
stipend is from 70 l. to 80 l. Sterling, according to the rise
or fall of grain, part of it being paid in meal and barley.  The
glebe consists of about 18 acres.  The Earl of Kinnoul is pa-
tron.
   The poor have hitherto been well provided for, out of the
collections made at the church, dues of mortcloths, and the
interest of about 100 l. Sterling of poor's money; but that
they will continue to be much longer so, out of there funds,
considering the great influx of inhabitants, is very doubtful.
There are no vagrant poor in the parish.
   The schoolmaster's salary is 100 l. Scotch, out of which he
pays, annually, 2 l. Sterling for a person to teach a school in
a distant part of the parish.  Besides the parish dues, which
are now pretty considerable, the schoolmaster has somewhat
more than an acre of land, originally fued by the session for
his behoof.  This piece of ground was lately exchanged for
an equal quantity, with much advantage to the schoolmaster,
by Mr Dunmore, as it stood in the way of some of his im-
provements.  Upon the ground Mr Dunmore gave in ex-
change, he built, at his own expence, a neat and commodi-
ous school room, with a lodging for the master, of 4 rooms,
all under one roof.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Peat and turf, of which there
are great abundance in the parish, were, previous to 1790,
almost the only fuel used; but, since roads were made, coal
is chiefly burnt, at least by the people in the village.  It is
brought from Campsie or Baldernock, the carriage being up-
wards of ten miles.  Red and white freestone are found in
great plenty.  There is also lime-stone.  Repeated attempts
