purity of their sand.  It must have been a prodigious agita-
tion of the ocean, that could so affect an inland frith, as to 
throw out, within reach of the wind, such accumulations of 
sand, as are now contained in the parishes of Kinloss, Dyke,
and Auldearn.  But the wide opening into the Moray Frith,
from Buchan-Ness to Dungsbay-Head, has made it liable,
wherever the coast was flat, to a wider inundation, and deep-
er load of sand, through the confinement of a large body of 
water, forced up into a narrowing channel.  But the vio- 
lent commotions of the German Ocean, are visible on the 
coast of Holland, and all along the eastern coast of Great 
Britain, from the Goodwin Sands in Kent, to the Pentland
Frith.
   Though the era of the sand's arrival here, is beyond the
reach of local tradition, history takes notice of several inun-
dations, when large quantities of sea-sand, might have been
lodged, and augmented upon our flat and early cultivated coast.
The deluge, in later times, that seems most likely to have
had the greatest effect, in this way, upon our island, is that 
inundation of the German Ocean which swept away the 
princely estate of Earl Goodwin, in Kent, and left the Good-
win Sands in its room.  Such a commotion of the waters
as could produce that effect, must have reached all the friths,
on the eastern coasts, as far up as the salt-water could flow,
and must have affected the navigation, as well as the agri-
culture, of the coast, upon that side.
   The era of this calamitous event, was in the close of the
11th century. in the reign of King William Rufus of Eng-
land, and near the demise of King Malcolm Canmore of 
Scotland.
   I.  Trussler, who has probably followed Blair's Chrono-
logy, and the English historians, in this matter, refers the
origin of the Goodwin Sands to the year 1100.
