   Miscellaneous Observations.-The Gaelic was generally
spoken here till about 50 years ago.-Peats are the only fuel.
-The general size of the people is about 5 feet 6 inches,
and their complexion black.  Many of them are very de-
ficient in industry, but oeconomical.  They are fond of a
military life, and prefer the Highland regiments.-The
roads in the parish were formerly well made, and kept in
good repair; but, for some time past, they have been
greatly neglected.  The people sensible of this neglect,
pay the statute-labour in kind, and work, it may be sup-
posed, as little as possible.  Were a more liberal plan of
management adopted, and the statute-labour commuted,
it would be more agreeable, and of much advantage.  The
people here have no idea of turnpikes, or their advantages.
-In 1782, there was neither a sufficiency of seed nor bread,
and had not Government interfered, numbers must have
starved; but the supply granted, relieved, in a great de-
gree, their wants.-The parish, in general, is uninclosed.
The people are sensible of the advantage of inclosures, but
they are little encouraged, except by one of the heritors.
The condition of the people might be much meliorated, by
granting them leases for 38 years, and a lifetime, by en-
couraging inclosures, and giving them good examples of
husbandry.
