that Islay lies under, by a scarcity of wood; timber being
brought from the northern lakes, at a very high price, and
difficult to obtain even for it, owing to the great demand for
charcoal.  Hence implements for husbandry, house-building,
and carpentery business, come to be very expensive.

   Fisheries, Fuel, &c.-But if the sea has bared our coun-
try of wood, it has filled its coasts with fish.  Lochindale
affords all kinds of sea fish, and Portnahaven, a fishing village,
in the Rinns of lslay, is famous for its cod fishing: And for
their encouragement, Mr. Campbell of Shawfield has given
them some boats, lands, and timber for houses.  Another very
great advantage, we have, is, that no country is better supplied
with fire and water.  Almost every farm has peatmoss within
itself, of an excellent kind, affording charcoal for the smith, as
we have no coals.  These peats, with the fish oil they burn
in lamps, make the habitation of the meanest cottager warm
and cheery.  As to our waters, there are alembics enough to
make them light and wholesome.  They are remarkably good
for bleaching, which the clearness of our linens can show;
and it is probable the bleaching business might be prosecuted
with great advantage in Islay.

   Lake and Island.-There are no waters in the parish that
deserve the name of rivers.  There is one lake, which covers
about 100 acres of land, and is well supplied with fine trouts.
There are several large oak trees at the bottom of it, which
shews the country was once under wood.  In this lake, there
is a small island, fortified very strong.  Its bastions are all
entire.  To this fort, it is said, M'DNALD of ISLAY betook
himself in his difficulties*.  Now the owls of the desert nestle
in it.
