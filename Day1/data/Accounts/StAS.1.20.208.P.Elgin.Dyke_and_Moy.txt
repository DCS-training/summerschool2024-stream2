   Cattle.-Runts, and yell or dry cows, are the chief articles
in the cattle trade:  we spare some of every kind, and stots
sell deareit; yet they ought rather to be wrought out.  It
would be more profitable to carry on the farm-work alto-
gether with oxen, which are fit for every work except ri-
ding, are much more easily maintained, are far less liable
to sudden diseases, and, in the end, fetch a good price for
beef:  when old, horses must be given to the dogs.  Some
have estimated the difference of working a farm with hor-
ses, and with oxen, to amount, all things considered, to the
value of the rent:  the saving upon oats is great.

   Fishings of Salmon.-Fresh salmon are sometimes sent to
London in ice; but are mostly kitted at Findern.  The
trade has been much monopolized by an Aberdeen compa-
ny, who took leases of all the fishings they could get
throughout the north, and bought up the fish caught by
other lessees.  The boil-house prices, allowed by that com-
pany, were, in the first of the season to the 1 ft of May, 4 d.
per lb. gross weight; from 1 ft May to end of May, 3 d.;
thence to th end of June 2 1/2 d. and while they continue to
kit.  Three fishes of 10 lib. suffice for one kit; this, at the
early price, comes to 10 s.  The kit, boiling, and curing,
with freight, and other costs, bring up the charges to 13 s.
per kit; which fetches, at London, from 18 s. to 31 s. 6 d.
The profit, therefore, on kitting fish, bought at the above
prices, runs from 94 to 135 per cent. nearly.
   In times of scarcity, they kit as long as it is allowabl to
fish.  But, generally, after the 1 ft of June, the raw fish
are cured in barrels, with one-half boll of foreign salt to
each barrel.  From 30 to 40 well sized fish make a barrel,
of 4 cwt.  The salt and barrel cost from 12 s. to 13 s.  The
freight is 3 s. to London, and 4 s. 6 d. to Holland.  The bar-
