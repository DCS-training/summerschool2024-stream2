clambered in search of plants, and discovered some rare
and uncommon ones, as may be seen in his Flora Scotica.
At every reach of the Mouss, of which there are many,
the scenery varies, and wherever you find a prominent
rock upon the one side, you are sure to meet with a regular
recess on the other.  Caverns in the rocks are here and
there observable, but none of them worthy of any parti-
cular description.  One, still called Wallace's cove, tra-
dition tells us, was the hiding hole of that patriot.  An-
other equally trifling, but which bears evident marks of
the chissel, is said to have been the abode of a hermit in
former times, but must have been a miserable habitation,
hardly affording room to lye down in.  Considerable veins
of the spatum ponderosum run through these rocks; but
no other mineral has hitherto been traced in this dreary den
of foxes, badgers and wild birds.  It is somewhat singular
how the Mouss, instead of following its direct course, by
Baronald house, where the ground is lower and unob-

Cartlane, and formed a bed through solid rock.  It seems
presumable that this vast chasm has originally been
formed by some earthquake, which, rending the rocks, al-
lowed the water to pass that way.

   There are no Orchards of any consequence excepting a-
bout Holmfoot, in the lower part of the parish.  Small ones
have been lately planted at Castlebank, and at Baronald in
