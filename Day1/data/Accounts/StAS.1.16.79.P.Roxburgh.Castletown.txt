forms, now beautiful, then awful, sometimes sublime, and
frequently terrible.  The author of this account measured
the principal falls.  One is 27 feet perpendicular in height,
another 31 1/2; the breadth of the rock over which it falls,
36; a third is 37 1/2 in height, and 20 feet wide.

   Natural Bridge of Stone.-One of the greatest curiosities
to be seen in this country, or perhaps in Scotland, is a na-
tural bridge of stone over the same river.  It stretches
across the stream, and joins the hills on each side.  It is
55 feet long, 10 feet wide, and the thickness of the arch is
2 feet 4 inches of solid stone.  It is not composed of one
entire rock, but has the appearance of many stones about a
foot and a half square, set neatly together.  The bridge
slopes a little downwards, and the water rushes under the
arch, through an opening of 31 feet.

   Woods.-The natural woods consist of oak, ash, birch,
and alder.  Considerable plantations have been made of
Scots fir, spruce, larix, oak, ash, beech and plane.  They
are all in a thriving condition.  There is at present grow-
ing on the river Blackburn, an old ash tree, the trunk of
which measures 18 feet in circumference, one branch of it
9 feet, and another 8.  The trunk is hollow, within; five
persons of ordinary size may easily fit in it at the same
time.  Last year the river Liddal, in the time of a high
flood, threw up the trunk of an oak tree, opposite to Hag-
gihaugh, the seat of Colonel Elliot of Lariston.  Not only
the bark, but great part of the wood, seems wasted by age;
notwithstanding which this venerable trunk, as it now lies,
measures 26 feet in length, and 10 feet in circumference,
and is perfectly straight.  There is scarcely a tree within
view of the place where it lies, excepting a few Scotch firs.
