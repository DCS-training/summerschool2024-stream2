surface. Under this seam, at a depth of six fathoms, a very good
slaty coal of about the same thickness as the upper seam, is like-
wise wrought. Both coals are overlain by limestone, and the re-
gularity of the beds is frequently intersected and dislocated by
dikes and other disturbing causes, denominated "troubles." A
sandstone quarry in the neighbourhood of the village has been less
or more wrought, during the last forty years. The stone is of a
fine cream colour, and, though a little coarse in the grain, it is very
durable, and well adapted for every purpose of country masonry.
Though this stone is to be had in large masses at the quarry, or
in plates of large dimensions, it not unfrequetitly occurs in a shat-
tered form, and in that case is almost useless for building. There
are likewise two flagstone quarries open at present, for the produce
of which there is a considerable demand; and limestone, held in
much repute, abounds in the west part of the parish. It is fur-
nished at the kiln at the rate of 10s. 6d. per chalder of 16 bolls.
	Produce.--The average gross amount of raw produce yearly
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol-
lows:

	Manufactures.--About thirty-five years ago, a small cotton ma-
nufactory was established here by Mr George Allan. The mill
was burned down in 1831, and rebuilt by him on an enlarged scale;
but in 1834, he sold the building to Mr David Watson, Glasgow,
who has fitted it up as a spinning power-loom manufactory. It is
five stories in height with attics. The spinning-machinery, which
consists of about 4000 self-acting mule-spindles, was fitted up by
Mr Smith of Deanston, on Smith and Orr's patent principle, and
is allowed by judges to be equal, if not superior, to any in the
kingdom. It is driven by two engines, one of 32, and the other
of 12 horse power. The work employs in all 350 hands, who are
paid about L. 250 per fortnight of wages. The men earn from
10s. to L. 1, 5s.; females from 5s. to 8s.; and boys and girls from
2s. 6d. to 5s. weekly. The average working time, according to
the Act of Parliament, is sixty-nine hours weekly, or twelve hours
