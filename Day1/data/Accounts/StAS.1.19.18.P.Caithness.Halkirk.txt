     Statistical Account

of it is derived from the religious house, which was imme-
diately below it, called the Hospital, by way of contrac-
tion, Spittal.
   Another hill should not here be omitted; because,
though it is not in this parish, it is yet on the near confines
of it, I mean the hill of Dorrary.  Its distance from the
Spittal Hill is about 12 or 13 miles due west.  It is of con-
siderable height, if taken from the shore or the church, of this
parish.  There is a good deal of arable ground about its
base, which yields good crops of corn, a prodigious quantity
of natural hay, and affords excellent pasture for a great
number of cattle; it is, therefore, esteemed the best High-
land farm in the country.  It belongs to the parish of
Thurso, though not within 4 miles of any part of that pa-
rish.  It is a part of the bishop-lands, was a shieling be-
longing to the bishops of this county, and from this cir-
cumstance it derives its name.  It commands the fame
grand extensive prospect with the other hill, though it is
not so centrical.

   Marl, Stones, Limestone, Mines.-There have been dis-
covered of late figured stones, having the impression of
plants and fishes.  These were found in the course of at-
tempts that were made by the direction and encourage-
ment of Sir John Sinclair, to discover mines.  I have been
also informed, that shells of several kinds have been, and
are still to be found in several parts of this parish; and this
is not to be doubted, since great quantities of marl, excel-
lent in its kind, are found in several parts, and applied to
land with great success and advantage.
   As to stones, having anticipated this article, I will only
further observe, that there is no freestone in this parish;
that there are excellent lime-quarries, attended with this
great advantage, viz. excellent peat-banks close by them;
