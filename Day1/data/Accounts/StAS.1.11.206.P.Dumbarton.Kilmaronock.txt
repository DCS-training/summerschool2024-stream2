     Statistical Account

   Springs, Woods, and Game.-Every field almost abounds
with perennial springs, oozing from rocks of free-stone.  Of
these St. Maronoch's Well is the most famous.  From the
springs collected, small rivulets run, intersecting the grounds,
and render them very convenient for pasturage.-There are
several woods in the parish, the value of which has consider-
ably increased within these few years.  The woods on the
banks of Lochlomond, belonging to Miss Buchanan of Drum-
kill, and John Buchanan, Esq. of Ardoch, abound with wood-
cocks, in the beginning of winter.-The moors, on the con-
fines of the parish, are much resorted to by the sportsmen, in
the hunting season.  There is a general complaint, that the
birds are much scarcer within these few years.  This may
be partly accounted for from the increase of the stock of sheep,
and the small inducement the shepherds have to preserve the 
game.

   Antiquities.-There are the remains of 2 Romish chapels.
At Catter, now the property of the Duke of MONTROSE,
there is a large artificial mound of earth, where, in ancient
times, courts were held; near to which the Duke of Lennox
had a place of residence.  There is not now the smallest ves-
tige of the building.  The castles of Kilmaronock* and Bat-
turret+, now in ruins, appear to have been formerly very
magnificent edifices.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no towns nor vil-
lages in the parish, nor any manufactures carried on.  The
