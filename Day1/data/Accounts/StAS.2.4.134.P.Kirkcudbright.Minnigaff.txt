dle stirred less or more, and after ye nurse had said the words, she bad ye deponent
say them to, and that she accordingly said the same words back again to the nurse,
and that the deponent had said to ye nurse Malley, before ever she meddled with it,
that if she knew yr was any evil in doing of it she would not meddle with it, and ye
nurse replied yr was no evil in it, and further, that to shift the meddling with it, she
offered to take ye child from ye lady's armes, but ye young lady put her to it, bid-
ding her go do it. As also, yt further ye said Marion depones, yt ye same day, a
little after ye young lady bad her go to ye barn, and yr do it over again with the
nurse, which she positively refused; wherupon ye young lady did it herself, with
all the circumstances she and the nurse had done it in the chamber before; moreover,
that some dayes after, the chamber door being close upon the young lady and her
nurse Malley, ye deponent, looking through a hole in ye door, saw ye nurse and ye
lady standing, and ye riddle betwixt ym as before, but heard nothing. And further,
yt ye lady and her nurse bad her deny these things, but did not bid her swear to it."
	For her participation in this affair, the young Lady Tonderghee, Mrs Janet Blair,
was cited before the session; and having expressed her penitence for being ensoared
into such sinful practices, she and Marion Murray subscribed a declaration to be read
before the congregation, " abhorring and renouncing all spelles and charmes usual to
wizard; and having been rebuked and exhorted to greater watchfulness for the fu-
ture, they were dismissed," The originator of the affair, Malley Redmond, after mak-
ing her appearance to be rebuked before the congregation, was banished the parish.
	On occasion of the union betwixt the two kingdoms, we find the following:--28d

bounds to observed a day of fasting and humiliation, with prayer and supplication to
God, for conduct and direction to those concerned in the treaty of union betwixt the two
kingdoms, and other weight reason, therefore this session appoint Tuesday come eight
days to be observed by them for the reasons, other public affairs not suffdring to
observed it sooner; and all the members are desired to attend at ten o'clock forenoon.
