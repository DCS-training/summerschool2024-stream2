stone of wool, which sells from 15 s. to 18 s. per stone, and
goes into Yorkshire to be manufactured, excepting a small
quantity which is sent to Aberdeenshire.  This breed of
sheep are uncommonly good feeders, but often do not carry
so much tallow as many other kinds do, in proportion to their
weight.  Mr. Culley has undoubtedly the merit of having
first introduced this breed of sheep into the country, about 20
years ago or more; and at present there are 8 or 9 people in
the district of country betwixt the Cheviot and Lammermuir-
hills, whose sheep stock are very highly improved.  The
sheep of the low part of the country are all of this kind, and
are found the more profitable the oftener that they have been
crossed by the best breeds.  The number of them, as well as of
the horses and black cattle, depends so much upon the state of
the lands in different years, whether in corn or in pasturage,
that it is almost impossible to give an exact account of them:
In general, there may be from 1500 to 2500 sheep in the pa-
rish.  The sheep formerly in this country, called Muggs, were
a tender, slow feeding animal, with wool over most of their
faces, from whence the name of Muggs.  There is hardly ant
individual of this species now to be met with in the neigh-
bourhood.  Mr. Culley's kind of sheep, on the other hand,
have open countenances, without any wool on the face from
the ears forward, and are as kindly feeders as the others are
flow ones.  They are neither long bodied, nor long legged,
but well made, handsome sheep, deep in their chest, broad at
their shoulders, loins, and crops, which last are thrown well
back; and they are deep and broad of their breasts, which are
well seen before; and stand on well proportioned, clean, small
boned legs.  Mr. Culley's flock is almost entirely sprung from
Mr. Bakewell's, as he wifely perceived that Mr. Bakewell
was in the right tract of breeding, long before most people
would allow it.
