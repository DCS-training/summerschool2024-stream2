   Agriculture and Husbandry.-The richest and best cultivat-
ed land in this country extends nearly a mile in width on
both sides of Loch Tay.  The soil, which is of a loamy tex-
ture, has, in the course of time, been carried down by the
rains from the higher grounds; and is enriched with the
spoils of decayed animals and vegetables.  The hilly land
chiefly consists of a light mossy kind of soil, which naturally
is not unfriendly to vegetation.  Heath, bent, and coarse
grasses, are the general product of the hills and muirs; but
the vallies and water carried soils in the glens, etc. produce
good crops of excellent grasses.  The grains chiefly cultivac.
ed are oats, bear or big (four-rowed barley), beans, pease, po-
tatoes, and lint.  The average return of oats is 3 or 4, and
of barley 4 or 5.  The return of lint is commonly a stone
of flax from the lippie, Potatoes in general make a good re-
turn.  The old system of rotation, namely, the infield land
with oats and bear alternately, and the outfield with oats and
ley, is in general continued, Each farm is commonly sub-
divided among several tenants, a practice which does not
merit the highest, approbation*.  These tenants have each a
separate lease or verbal bargain, the duration of which is
mostly from year to year, at the will of the proprietor.  Un-
