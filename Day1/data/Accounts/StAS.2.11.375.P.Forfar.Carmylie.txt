stituted here in 1816, and consisted of about 200 members, be-
longing to this and to some of the neighbouring parishes. It appear-
ed to be in a very prosperous state; but declining to adopt the re-
gulations contained in a late Act of Parliament, regarding such
societies, it was, in 1830, dissolved by mutual consent, and the
funds divided among the members. I hoped that a new society,
founded on more correct principles, would have succeeded it; but
many of these to whom such association, would prove most bene-
ficial, seem now less inclined than formerly to enter into them.
	There is no savings-bank in the parish, and the nearest of this
description is at Arbroath, instituted a considerable time ago. *
	Poor and Parochial Fundr.,-The annual average number of
persons receiving Parochial aid for the last seven years is 16; and
the annual average sum allotted to each is L.2, 6s. 8 1/2d.+ The
annual average of contributions for their relief, for the above years
is, 1. ordinary and extraordinary collections at church, L.43, 4s.
9d.; 2. proclamation dues, 18s. 8d.; 3, mortcloth dues, L1, Os.
10d.; 4. fines from delinquents, L. 1, 1s.; 5. seat rents, L. 9, 19s. 6d.
6. interest of poor's fund in Bank, L. 2, 16s. 7d.: 7. custom of
Carmylie market, 2s.; 8. donations, 7s 3d.; total L. 59, 10s. 7d.
	The only other regular mode adopted in the parish, for procur-
ing funds for the poor, besides that of church collections, is by let-
ting annually certain sittings in the church, which were erected
many years ago, by the kirk-session from the poor's funds, for be-
half of the parish poor; and from the rents received, a small but
permanent surplus fund has been obtained for some years past.
There is another mode occasionally had recourse to, for the relief
of individual distress or misfortune. A written statement of the
case is sent round among the wealthier parishioners, and recom-
mended to their notice by the kirk-session. Such recommenda-
tions are but seldom given, but never in vain; and the contributions
raised in this way, are generally such as to afford to thd hndividual
