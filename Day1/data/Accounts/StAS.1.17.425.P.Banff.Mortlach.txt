there must be the difference of 8 or 10 days, at least, in the
time of towing, in the different parts of this extensive coun-
try; and even the same kind of grain, sown in the same day,
will be ready for the hook several weeks sooner in Balveny
and Kinninvie, than in Glenrinnes and Glenmarky.  In this
view, Auchindown and Edinglassie have an intermediate
place, being neither so early as the two first of those districts,
nor so late as the other two*.

   Cattle and Pasturage.-As to the live stock here, there will
be about 2000 black cattle, from 300 to 400 horses for
plough, cart, and harrow, 4000 or 5000 sheep, some goats,
and a few swine about the mills and distilleries.  The black
cattle are of the middle sized and handsome highland breed;
the ox from 5 to 8 guineas, and the cow worth 4 or 5, as
the prices happen to go.  Many of the farms, having plenty
of summer grass, are well suited for cattle and corn too.
There are also some very good sheep-walks, one of the best
of which is in Glenmarky.  The ewes and lambs, which
are mostly now of the black-faced Linton sort, sell from 5 L.
to 7 L the score; and wedders much about the same: But
all such calculations muff be understood with a little latitude,
and as only there and thereabout.  It is impossible to make
them otherwise.  The white-faced sheep, who may be stiled
the aborigines of the country, are wearing out; and yet, tho'
smaller, they are allowed by many to yield both the sweeter
mutton and the finer wool.  Wool sells from 10 s. to 16 s.
per stone, according to the quality and demand; but the
stone consists, it seems, of 22 lib.  Dutch; one instance,
among a thousand, of the great propriety of simplifying our

*The average rate of an acre is about 10 s.; and the farms
are of many a different size, from a 5 l. rent, and even less, to
70 L. or 80 L.
