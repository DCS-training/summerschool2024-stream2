important article, a temporary dearth of which was lately
so severely felt in the city and neighbourhood of Edin-
burgh.  Of such unwelcome interruptions of the public
supplies of fuel, and of the serious inconveniences which
they produce, there are causes which are not perhaps at-
tended to so much as they deserve.  Since the period when
the coalliers were emancipated by the interposition of the
legislature from that state of villainage, by which, like the
