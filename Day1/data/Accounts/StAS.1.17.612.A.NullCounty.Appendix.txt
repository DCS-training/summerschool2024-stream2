<APPENDIX>

Hab and Halbert, and a favourite in the family, had at that,
or some former period, chosen this spot for the scite of his
hut.  There are still the remains of a cottage on the top
of the north bank, immediately over it, and the pool con-
tinues to be the favourite place for bathing.  Farther up still,
the grounds beyond the How Burn, to the westward, called
Carlops, a contraction for Carline's Loup, were supposed once
to have been the residene of a Carline or Witch, who lived
in a dell, at the foot of the Carlops Hill, near a pass between
two conic rocks: from the opposite points of which she
was often observed at nights, by the superstitious and igno-
rant, bounding and srisking on her broom, across the en-
trance.  Not far from this, on a height to the east is a very
ancient half withered solitary ash tree, near the old mansion-
house of Carlops, overhanging a well, with not another of
30 years standing in sight of it; and from the open grounds
to the south, both it and the glen, with the village, and some
decayed cottages in it, and the Carline's Loups at its month,
are seen.  Ramsay may not have observed, or referred to this
tree, but it is a curious circumstance that it should be there,
and so situated as to compleat the resemblance to the scene,
which seems to have been taken from the place.

     ACT II. SCENE II.

     
     The open field.-A cottage in a glen,
     An auld wife spinning at the sunney end.-
     At a small distance, by a blasted tree,
     with falded arms, and half-raised look ye see,
     Bauldy his lane.

The tradition, the objects of the landscape, and the poet's in-
timate acquaintance with every thing connected with his
friends property, all tend to show, that not only the seenery.
