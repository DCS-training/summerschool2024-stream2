This is chiefly owing to the sudden elevation of the ground: the
lowest part of the parish being only 95 feet above the level of the sea,
while the highest is 652, being a difference of 557 feet in the short
distance of two miles and a half,--thus presenting a diversified sur-
face, and a variety of soil and climate, giving origin to numerous
general and species. The following list, beginning at the lowest
part of the parish, enumerates, the rarest of the plants.

	There is, generally speaking, a want of ornamental trees and of
plantations in this parish. Some exceptions, however, must be
made to this general remark. Caldwell House is situated in a large
park, richly clothed with wood, and many of the trees are of great
size and, beauty. Hazlehead presents several avenues of fine old
beeches, and on some other places of Mr S. Patrick's property
there are young thriving,plantations. Mr Pratt of Brown Muir
planted, about four years ago, Brown Muir Hill, consisting of from
twenty to thirty Scotch acres, which, a few years hence, will add
greatly to the beauty of the parish.
