   Roads and Bridges.-Very particular attention has been paid
of late years to the roads in this district; and the bridges have
been widened for the conveniency of carriages.  The new
bridge over Aultgrande is remarkably neat, and well finished,
and does not credit to Mr Kyle, the architect, who built it.  All
the bridges are built and kept in repair at the expence of the

road that leads through this parish, which will add much to
the pleasure and comfort of travellers.  The chief heritor
has, at a considerable expence, carried off the road in a sweep

the middle of rich fields and fine plantations of trees, but
will also have a full view of that ancient and elegant mansion,
Fowlis Castle.  This improved road was begun in 1790, and
will be completed in the course of 1791.

   Villages, Schools, & Manufacturers.-There is only one small
village in the parish, called Drummond, situated in a level

considerably in a few years.  At present, there is a public
house, two shop-keepers, a dyer of woolen stuffs, who keeps
a press and scouring mill; and a few other mechanics.  Two
