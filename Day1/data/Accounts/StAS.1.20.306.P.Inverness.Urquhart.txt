be not counterbalanced by a degree of idleness and diffipa-
tion, with which the distillery of spirits is attended.  At
the same time, it must be acknowledged, that there is
as little of this in the parish as in most situations where
whisky is manufactured.  Indeed, it is difficult to lay how
the bear could be disposed of to advantage in any other
way than by distillation, as the people are uncquainted
with brewing it into beer, and that too many prefer whisky
to ale or porter,  though this be fortunately wearing out.  If
manufactured into meal, that meal would scarcely find sale
among Highlanders, who never use it when oat-meal can
be found: And, of course, bear would give a very inferior
price to what is given by distillers.  One, and sometimes
two licences, for stills of from 30 to 40 gallons each, are ta-

ciently good for distillation.
   Glenmoriston does now generally supply itself with grain,
but exports none; and it is only since the general cultivation
of potatoes that it could support itself.  In Urquhart there
are about 800 milch-cows, and double that number of
yell cattle.  In Glenmoriston, some more than 500 milch-
cows, and yell cattle in a larger proportion.  From both
glens, a considerable quantity of butter and cheese is fold,
besides what is consumed by the inhabitants; but more
from Urquhart, in proportion to the number of milch-cows,
than from Glenmoriston.  The black cattle are generally
of the Highland breed, and good of their kind; Mr Grant
of Corrimony's breed is particularly excellent, and inferior
perhaps to none in the Highland.  Most of the farmers
keep sheep; but there are no regular sheep farms, except
Corrimony's, and one in Glenmoriston, both of which turn
out well.  Among the smaller tenants, the breed of sheep
has been much improved, by the purchase of tups and
