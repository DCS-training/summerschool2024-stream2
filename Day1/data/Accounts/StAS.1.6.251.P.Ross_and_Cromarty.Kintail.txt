     of Kintail.

one-third of the parishioners can meet at the usual places of
worship, which are three, Kiel duich, Glenelchaig, and Dor-
nie.  From 1 ft June to 12th August, the people follow their
flocks to hill grazings.  The annual distribution to the poor,
therefore, does not exceed 50 s. or 60 s.-There is no other
public fund in the parish except 50,000 merks Scotch, morti-
fied by the late Mr Alexander M'Rae, of Dornie; and left
under the management of the King's College of Aber-
deen, for educating the children of the nearer descendants
from Alexander M'Rae, son of Mr Farquhar M'Rae, the first
Protestant minister in the parish of Kintail; of whom is de-
scended the present Mr M'Rae of Innerinate, the only gentle-
man residing within the parish.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Reasons for the growth of Popery.  1st, The Presbytery of Lochcarron in
1778 entered into a resolution, and passed an act obliging every member thereof
to keep regular registers of baptism.  And that, instead of the usual due, one
shilling should in future be exacted, to enable the schoolmasters to keep up
and preserve the registers.-Many of the most ignorant in Glenelchaig
hearing of the new act, considered it as a heavy grievance; and, to avoid its
consequence, applied to Roman Catholic priests for baptism, and in the heat
of passion dragged whole families after them.-2d, Popery has increased
by intermarriages.  When a Protestant man marries a Roman Catholic wo-
man he has very little domestic peace or happiness till he prosesses that re-
ligion, in which, he is often told by the wife, salvation can only be expected
