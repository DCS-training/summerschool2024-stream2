           1755, when it was said to be 1790.  Again, in the year 1793, it
           was stated at 1786.   It is supposed, however, that in each of
           these cases the population was estimated by the very imperfect
           mode of allowing three, four, or five individuals to each family.-
           a method, which, even under the most favourable circumstances,
           can be viewed only as an approximation to the truth, while in no
           case can it be depended upon, if any thing like accuracy be re-
           quired.  By the Parliamentary census taken at different periods,
           the population was found to be as under:-

                         1821,       2904         250        _____
                         1831,       2714        _____        190
              The chief cause assigned at the time for the increase from
           1801 to 1811, was the general introduction of vaccine ino-
           culation, which, previous to 1801, was scarcely known in this
           parish.  Another reason then given was the encouragement afford-
           ed by Colonel Graham of Balgowan, now Lord Lynedoch, and
           by the Honourable Lord Methven, father of the present pro-
           prietor of the estate of Methven, to enterprising agriculturists to
           settle upon their estates.  The apparent increase of 250 from
           1811 to 1821, was evidently owing to this circumstance, viz. in the
           former case it was the population of the quoad sacra parish that
           was enumerated, while in the latter, it was that of the parish quoad
           civilia.  The decrease of 190, between the years 1821, and 1831,
           was principally occasioned by the almost entire depopulation of
           the estate of Bachilton, the property of Lord Elibank, which in
           the year 1821 was occupied by twelve tenants,-farmers, besides
           their cottars and dependents; whereas at the latter date, this ex-
           tensive and valuable property m`y be said to have been, as it still
           is, in the hands of one person.
              The village of Methven contains a population of 1000; and
           that of Almondbank 300, these being the only villages in the pa-
           rish.  The rest of the population are chiefly engaged in rural and
           agricultural employment.
              It is impossible accurately to state the average number of births
           in the parish; for although all those who belong to the Establish-
           ed Church regularly attend to the registration of their children's
           names, even before they are baptized, yet very few, of those who
           are in connection with the Seceders take the trouble of discharg-
           ing this duty to their children.  If, however, we suppose the births
