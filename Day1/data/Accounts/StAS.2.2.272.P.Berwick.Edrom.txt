well-affected to both church and state. There are not many in-
stances of poaching in game and salmon. About forty or fifty years
ago there was a good deal of smuggling in this district, of brandy,
gin, teas, &c.; but now this is entirely unknown.

   A considerable quantity of fir and hard-wood is cut yearly on
some of the estates in the parish. On one estate the wood cut
and sold for a considerable number of years past, has brought
L. 300 per annum.
   Rent of Land.-The average rent of land per acre is about
L. 1, 5s.; the minimum price from 13s. to 15s. per acre; the best
land L. 2 per acre; some very good land, L. 2, 10s. and upwards.
The farms are in general large in this parish, and vary in rental
from L. 400 to L. 1000. The rental of the parish at the time of
the former Statistical Account was L. 6493; at present, it is about
L. 15,200. The average rent for grazing a cow or an ox is about
L. 4.
   Husbandry.-The general length of leases is nineteen years;
and the general routine of cropping is a four or five years' course.
The five-course system is now more generally followed. The four-
course is too severe for most kinds of lands.
   The whole land in the parish is in a state of good cultivation,
enclosed, and pretty well-drained; and the practice of draining is
kept up. A great many improvements have lately been made on
the estate of Kimmerghame, as to farm-buildings, young planta-
tions, &c.; and on the other estates, a similar spirit of improve-
ment and attention to the comfort of the agricultural population
have been evinced.
