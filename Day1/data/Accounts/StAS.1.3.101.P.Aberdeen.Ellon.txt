   School.-The salary and perquisites of the schoolmaster,
amount to about L. 13 Sterling yearly, with a dwelling-
house and garden, and 100 merks from the proprietor of
the estate of Watertown, with fees from the scholars, who
are not at all numerous.

   Poor.-The number of the poor in the parish, at present

of a small sum of money, and the rent of a little crost of
land; besides 100 merks mortified to the poor in the estate
of Ellon.

females are commonly employed, with some old men and
boys.  Of late some are employed in spinning linen yarn,
and easily earn more than by the stockings.  There was a
