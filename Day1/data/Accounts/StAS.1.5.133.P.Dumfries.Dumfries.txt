but many milk cows. A considerable number of hogs are
fed through the parish. These hogs are killed on the spot,
and sent to the borders of England to be cured. In this ar-
ticle some persons in the neighbourhood deal to the extent
of several hundred pounds per annum.

  Agriculture. - The improvements in agriculture have,
within these 30 years been very great. Oats were sown
in 1790 upon 720 acres of land in the parish, barley upon
240, wheat upon 180; and, at least, 200 acres were planted
with potatoes; 20 or 30 acres were sown with peas, and
nearly as many with turnips. Considerable quantities of
flax are raised in the parish. Within 8 miles of the town,
there are no fewer than 5 or 6 lint mills, which are all well
employed. To the cultivation of this article, the attention
of the trustees, &c. has greatly contributed. About a third
of the arable land may be reserved for pasture. Grass seeds
are carefully sown. Wheat is sown here between the mid-
dle of September and the middle of April; barley in A-
pril, and in the beginning of May, if the season has been fa-
vourable. Wheat and barley are reaped here in August,
and oats in September.

  Wood. - Several plantations are scattered through the pa-
rish; oak, elm, beech, ash, and fir, are the most common
trees. Around the town there are numerous inclosures, sur-
rounded with trees, which have a delightful effect.

  Rents and Valuation. - The valuation of the lands within
the royalty; in the cess books, is L. 2243 : 9 : 8 Scotch;
that of the houses, L. 12,293; the country part of the parish
is valued at 4017 merks, 6 s. 8 d. Scotch. The salmon fishing
may be valued at L. 100 Sterling a-year. The rents have
