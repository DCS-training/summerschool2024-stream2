most, between the southern and northern parts of the king-
dom.  There are in this parish only two boats; one of which
is very small, plies at high water, between Dingwall and
Ferrintosh, the other serves for the carriage of bulky arti-
cles from place to place.

   Quarries.-Three quarries have been opened in this pa-
rish.  The stones in one of them, which is not now used,
were of a very indifferent quality, being apt to moulder into
sand, when long exposed to the weather.  Another, the
property of the public, and discovered within these fifteen
years, is of a much better quality.  Its stones, though hard,
are extremely useful in all those parts of houses where hewn-
work is not necessary, and lying within a quarter of a mile
of the town, they have contributed not a little to its im-
provement and increate.  The third quarry, which is of a
time light blue colour, is private property.  It is of full su-
perior quality, as it is fit for hewn as well as for coarse
work, and is capable of a very fine polish.  It has, however,
one disadvantage; there is a small intermixture of iron ore,
upon which the rain in time operates, and stains in a very
ugly manner the contiguous stones.

   Domestic and Wild Animals.-The domestic quadrupeds
and birds are such as are usually found in every other part of
the country.  There are plenty of hares, and a little dis-
tance, great numbers of red deer.  Once, and, only once,
the minister saw two roe deer in the parish.  They were
probably driven by the severity of the weather, from the
woods among the neighbouring hills, to those in the lower
part of the country, where better shelter an more easy ac-
cess to pasture were found.  There are some foxes, with
the usual smaller kind of quadrupeds.
