the stock, are put to a separate part of the farm, where they
are kept apart from their dams, till next summer.  The rest
are either sold for slaughter, or for stocking farms in other
parts of the country.
   In the month of November the whole stock is smeared; a
practice which, although it is both expensive and troublesome,
is found to be not only necessary, but beneficial.  The salve,
a mixture of tar and butter, kills the vermin with which sheep
are infested, and makes the wool adhere closely to the animal.
This contributes both to its comfort during the winter, and
preserves a better fleece till the season of shearing, than what
is then found on the white or unsmeared sheep.  The wool
also, though not of so fair a colour as the unsmeared, is yet
of a better quality.  These advantages attendant upon smear-
ing, have been ascertained in the most satisfactory manner,
by a comparative experiment lately made by a farmer in this
place.  He took 100 lambs of the same stock, and divided
them equally; taking equal care in every respect of the two
parcels.  He smeared 50, and left 50 unsmeared.  At the
sheep shearing season, 4 fleeces of those that were smeared,
weighed a stone; whereas, it took 7 fleeces of the unsmear-
ed to produce the same weight.  The quality too of this
last was inferior, being coarse and matted.  He persisted in
the experiment for 5 years, and the older the sheep grew,
the preference in favour of the smeared wool became still
more decided; till at last the merchant could scarcely be
prevailed upon to take the white wool at the same price
with the smeared.  The ewes also failed sooner than the
others; so that he gave up the attempt, fully convinced of
the propriety of smearing the wool stock.
   The same enterprising spirit, however, which prompted the
above experiment, induced him to try others, for reducing
the expence of smearing.  After repeated trials of sundry in-
