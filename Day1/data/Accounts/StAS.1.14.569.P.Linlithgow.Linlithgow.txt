     Of Linlithgow.

   The Carmelites, or White Friars, had a convent at Lin-
lithgow, which stood on the S. side of the town.  The
eminence bears still the name of the Friars Brae, and the
adjoining well bears a similar designation.  The applica-
tion of their revenues cannot now be traced.-This esta-
blishment, in point of antiquity, was the third of the kind
in Scotland.  It was founded in 1290 by the inhabitants
of Linlithgow, and consecrated to the Virgin Mary.
   There is said also to have been a monastery of Domi-
nicans or Black Friars here.  Som remains of a religious
house, probably this, may still be discerned in the E. part
of the town.  There was also a chapel, sacred to St. Ni-
nian, at the West-port, though no traces of it now re-
main.  There was another erection of a similar kind at
East Birmy, in the extremity of the parish; but no satis-
factory account of it can now be had.
   St. Magdalane's, on the E. of the town, was an hospi
tium, or place of entertainment for strangers.  It had ori-
ginally belonged to a set of Lazarites; but, on their ex-
tinction or secularization, was applied to this purpose, ac-
cording to the beneficial institution of James I.  The
eminence, at the bottom of which this hospital stood, is
still designed-Pilgrim-hill.
   There are two eminences on the W. of the town, on
one of which courts of justice are said to have been held
in ancient times. The plain below had, probably from
this circumstance, the name of Doomsdale given, which it
still retains.
   To the W. of the town, near the bridge, is a field an-
ciently used for military exercises and amusements, It
has still the name of Foisting-hough
   On the high hill formerly mentioned, the vestiges of a
military station may be traced.  There is also at the bot-
