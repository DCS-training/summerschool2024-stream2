     Statistical Account

here, before the middle of June, and give over towards
the 27th of September.  It is observed, that the skin of
the salmon, when it first gets up the river, is of a silvery
colour; but after remaining for some time in the rivers, the
waters of which are deeply tinged with moss, it becomes
of a brownish yellow.  There is also sea-tront to be found,
and  great abundance of fresh-water trout; besides the a-
bove mentioned rives, there is a small one named Tarf-
water, which forms the boundary between New Luce and
Kirkcowan.

   Minerals.-Two attempts have lately been made in quest
of lead ore in the farm of Knockebay, belonging to the
Earl of Stair; the first was made some years ago, and at
that time some hundred weights of rich ore were obtained;
within these two years a second trial was made; but at
this time little further was attempted than clearing part of
the old works.  It does not appear that the workmen, in
either of these trials, had met with any thing like a vein,
but only masses of floating ore.  Though appearances were
flattering, yet the undertaking appears to be abandoned for
reasons not known.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was
459 souls.  As the land is of a moorish nature, there are
but few inhabitants compared to the extent of the parish,
being not more that 400 in whole, of which number about
72 live in the village adjoining to the church.  No accu-
rate register hath been kept as to births and burials; I
cannot therefore exactly ascertain the number of either for
any given period of time; but from what information I
have received, I am led to conclued that the number of
births will, communibus annis, be from 6 to 7, and of bu-
rials from 5 to 6, and as to marriages, from 3 to 4 in a
year.
