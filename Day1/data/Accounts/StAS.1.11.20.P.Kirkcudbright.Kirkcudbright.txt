period, can be accounted for only from the contraband trade,
which it afterwards carried on with the Isle of Man.  This
illegal commerce deranged, for a while, all their ideas of fair
and upright dealing.  After this trade was set aside, large
smuggling companies established themselves along the coast of
Galloway, and with a high hand braved, for some time, all
the efforts of government to suppress them.  However, from
the vigilance and activity of the revenue officers, established
at the port, and particularly those upon the coast, this trade
has of late gradually declined.

   Manufactures.-About a year ago, some faint appearances
of manufactories, in the cotton line, began to shew them-
selves.  Mules and jennies have been erected, and weavers
brought from a distance to work with the fly-shuttle.  A
woollen manufactory is also begun, as well as a candle and
soap manufactory.  Should these branches happily succeed,
it would be of the utmost advantage to this town.  Would
government take off the high duty upon the importation of
coals*, which is the only fuel used in this place, it would
afford great encouragement to these manufactories, and turn
the attention of the people to a more certain profit, than they
can expect from the precarious advantages which result from
smuggling.

   Shipping.-Twenty-eight brigs and sloops belong to the
port and district; tonnage, 1053.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The COALS imported for three years past, within the custom-house district
of this place, amounted, upon an average, to 1490 chalders.  Of this quantity
the town and parish take the half, 755 chalders, which are equal to 605 tons.
The duty of this is 205 L.  The price, at the rate of 1 L. 6 s. per ton, is 786 L. 10 s.
