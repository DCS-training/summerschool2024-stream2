abscond. His charter was inscribed in the Gaelic language
and character upon a rock at the extremity of his estate.
It proved but a feeble security against the rapacity of a
barbarous age.  The property was contested for by the
Campbells and Macneils, the latter of whom were a power-
ful clan in North Knapdale, and decided in favour of the 
former by compromise.  It continued in the same family
till the year 1775, when, after the death of the tenth pos-
sessor, the estate was purchased by the late Lieutenant-Ge-
neral Sir Archibald Campbell of Inverneil.  The sword of
Macmillan is said to be still in preservation.  But it is sin-

collateral of the Knap family about 30 years ago.  Unless

Macmaster of Ceannlochcaolisport, Achahoish, and Ellary,
became masters of these lands, at a very early period, by the
murder of Macavern, the ancient proprietor.  A pool of 
the river, where he was a-sishing at the time, and cairn
where he fell, serve to perpetuate the memory of the fatal
catastrophe.  The pool is called to this day Lin-earn-vica-
vern, i.e. the Pool of Macavern's Cairn.  The posterity of
Macmaster were eminent so their dexterity at the sword, 
and their activity in repelling the incursions of neighbour-
