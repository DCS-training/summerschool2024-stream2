                      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
          Name.-"THE name of this parish," says the writer of the last
       Statistical Account, "seems to be derived' from the Gaelic word
       Coinneamh, signifying a meeting or junction ; and Ross-coinneamh
       may denote the place where the districts of Easter and Wester
       Ross join,-which is the western boundary of this parish, and
       Where the inhabitants might occasionally assemble."
          Extent and Boundaries.-This parish is situated on the northern
       shore of the Frith of Cromarty.  It is supposed to extend in
       length, from south-east to northwest, from 25 to 30 miles; its
       greatest breadth is about 12 miles.  It is bounded on the east by
       tbe parish of Kilmuir; on the west by Alness; on the north by
       the parish of Kincardine and Edderton; and on the south by
       the Frith of Cromarty.
          Topographical Appearances.-That part of the parish which
       lies along the coast, is level.  The ground rises from the sea coast
       with a gentle acclivity, for a distance of about four miles; after
       which, it becomes hilly.  The hills, however, are not in general
       of remarkable height.  The highest is Cairn Coinneag.  It is si-
       tuated on the confines of the parish, where it borders on the north-
       west with Kincardine and Alness, and is supposed to be about
                                   4
