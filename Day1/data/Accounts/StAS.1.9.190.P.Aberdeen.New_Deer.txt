be a frequent interchange of clouds between the summits
of 2 opposite hills, Bennachie and Mormond.  The former
is distant from us about 20 miles S W. the latter about
8 or 9 miles N. E.  But this observation is not to be con-
fined to this place alone; for such phoenomena, I believe,
are common to almost every part of Scotland.-There are
no diseases peculiar to this parish.  Rheumatism is the
most general complaint among the men, and nervous dif-
orders among the women.  To account for the prevalence
of these disorders, I need only mention the employment of
the former, which, after hard exercise in the morning, is to
go out and stir a damp field; and the sedentary occupation
of the latter, which is chiefly spinning or knitting of stock-
ings.  Scrofulous, consumptive, and asthmatic complaints
are not so common.  In autumn 1791, a putrid kind of
sore throat, which first made its appearance about the coast
side, found its way into this parish.  Since that, it has con-
tinued to rage in different places, with great virulence, and
little intermission, and is peculiarly fatal to the young, and
people of a full constitution.  No effectual remedy has yet
been discovered for this contagious disorder; and the only
approved medicines are a vomit at first, and then Jesuit's
bark, continued several times a-day, in a glass of Port
wine.  A very malignant fever, too, has prevailed this
winter.  Some were carried off by it in eight days illness,
while others have been languishing as many weeks.

   Natural History, Antiquities, etc.-There is neither a
wood, hill nor river in the parish; consequently no qua-
drupeds, migratory or aquatic birds, but such as are com-
mon: nor are there any remarkable fossils.  There is,
however, reason to believe, that this parish once abounded
in wood; for vestiges of oak, hazel, and other hard wood,
(but no fir), are to be found in every moss.  Springs and
