gardens, thyme, southernwood, balm, mint, chamomile, and
some flowers, which serve both for ornament and use.  The
barren wood, which grows wild, is chiefly alder, hazle,
beech, and birch.  Most of the wood in the plantations is the
common fir, intermixed with oak, ash, plane, larix, birch,
beech, etc.  The hedge rows are beech, elm, plane, chesnut,
larix, etc. but chiefly oak, which is planted in the greatest
abundance.  There is number of very fine trees in the low
part of the parish, which have arrived at maturity, amongst
which are not a few oaks.  And of this latter sort of wood,
there is such abundance, of about 20 or 30 years standing,
and in so thriving a condition, as affords the most pleasing
hopes, that, in some future period, it will contribute in a
great measure to supply our dock yards for ship-building;
especially if it be considered, that most of it grows within a
mile of the Earn, down which river it may be conveyed in
rafts, and shipped to any port in Britain.  Besides the ordi-
nary crops of barley and oats, and the different green crops,
there is raised, in the low part of the parish, a considerable
quantity of wheat.  In the hilly district, the principal
crops consists of oats, pease, and barley.  Potatoes and
flax are raised in abundance in both places.  Turnips also,
with which they seed their cattle, and some of their sheep,
are raised through the whole parish, but principally in the 
low grounds.

   Exports.-This parish exports, to different places in the
neighbourhood, several articles of provision, such as meal,
grain, butter, cheese eggs, poultry, black cattle, sheep, and
some honey.  And it is almost solely by their exports, toge-
ther with their linen yarn, that they are able to pay their
rents, and procure a subsistence.
