the traveller.  On the farther parts of the lands of Lochlibo,
the soil is more barren, the surface covered with bent and
heath, and partly with deep moss; which may, one day, be
of great importance to the country, by furnishing peats for fuel,
when all the coal mines in the neighbourhood are exhausted.
Along this tract of country, the traveller is delighted with a
very pleasant and picturesque landscape.  On nearly the same
spot, may be seen towards the south and west, the beautiful
and fertile plain of Ayrshire, washed by the firth of Clyde;
Ilsa, a stupenduous rock, standing alone, buffetted by the waves;
Arran, with a number of other is lands interspersed, in a channel
covered with ships; Carrick hills, and some mountains in Gal-
loway towards the south-east, and the boundless expanse of
waters which joins the Atlantic ocean, towards the south.
Towards the north and east, many of the most pleasant, and
romantic scenes in Scotland, present themselves to the view;
Lochlomond with several of her island; Benlomond with
his shoulders covered with snow, and his head enveloped with
clouds; the plains of Rensrew and Lanerk; the city of Glas-
gow, with her numerous and losty spires; and the prospect to-
wards the east, terminated by the mountains beyond the
Forth.  Several plantations of firs, larix, beeches, and other
forest trees, have lately been made in the neighbourhood,
which will greatly add to the beauty of the scene.-The
craig of Nielston, in the south part of the parish is the highest
in the district, and the only high hill which stands by itself,
not forming a ridge or tract of the country.  It is vulgarly cal-
led the Pad, from having in its appearance the form of a pil-
lion.  It is 820 feet above the flood mark, and yet is all green,
and arable to the very top, though now only used for pas-
ture.
