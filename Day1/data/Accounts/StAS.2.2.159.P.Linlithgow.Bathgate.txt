<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
   The population of this parish has been steadily increasing, as
the following table will show:

		In 1755, the population was	1594
	     	   1791,			2325
		   1801,  			2613
		   1821,			3283
		   1831,			3610
		   1841,			3927
The increase in the last ten years being 317, or less than ten
per cent. on the whole, seems to be nothing more than might be
expected in the natural progress of population.  Of the above
number, 2809 resided in the town of Bath gate, 103 in a small
village, and 1015 in the country part of the parish.
   The yearly average of births it is impossible to state accurately.
Many parents will not be at the trouble or expense of registration.
Estimating from the number baptized in the parish church, the num-
ber of births will be about 97 or 98 per annum.  The average of
deaths for the last seven years previous to 1838 has been 73, of which
19, or 26 per cent. were above seventy years of age, and 9. or 12.33
per cent. above eighty.  Taking the population during these seven
years as averaging 3700, the annual mortality was 1.973 per cent.
This very low rate proves the general healthiness of our climate
and situation.  It may be also partly attributed to the copious
supply of excellent water, brought into the town from the high,
grounds above.  The yearly average of marriages for the same
period was 28.
   This parish has few resident heritors.  Only five or six families,
of independent fortune reside in it.  There are connected with it
nineteen proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 and up-
wards.

Agriculture.-The number of imperial acres, either constantly
cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is 8712; those which have
never been cultivated, and which remain constantly waste or in
pastures amount to 803; under wood, 506, of which only 2 or 3
are natural.  The rest of the area of the parish is occupied by
the site of the town with its gardens, by fences, and roads.  Pre-
bably one-half of the waste land might be reclaimed at a profitable
rate.  The only thing like common occurs in the case of two pieces
