     Statistical Account

Tenants, who posses farms of 30 L. yearly rent, pay from 9 s.
to 14 s.  All above and below this sum pay in proportion.

spoken in its purity, neither here nor in any of the bordering
parishes.

lands.  The traders, in the village, traffic much with the people

Glenairtney.  It is the only one in this part of the country.
There is likewise an excellent lime quarry, at the W. end of
parish, very near the side of Loch-Erne, which has been
