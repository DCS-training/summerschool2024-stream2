      Agriculture.-
          The number of acres occasionally in tillage, is        7000
                                              pasture,          16000
                                              wood,              2000
   Rent of Land, &c.-The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 03s.
per acre.  The rate of grazing an ox or cow is L. 2, and 5s. per ewe
or full-grown sheep pastured for the year.  The rate of labour for
the different kinds of farm-labourers and country artisans is 1s. 6d.
per day, in summer, and 1s. 2d. in winter, and the rate of mason,
carpenter, and nther mechanical work is 2s.  The sheep is of the
black-faced Linton breed, and attention has been paid to their im-
provement.
   The husbandry pursued is generally of an improved character.
Many acres of waste land have been reclaimed, and due attention
has been paid to draining; though the Pow inundates the fertile
valley, on its banks, and deteriorates its luxuriant crops.  Were
its channel enlarged, this would be prevented, the soil would be
ameliorated, and the aqueous meteors which blight the crops would
be less injurious. This great and obvious improvement has often
been proposed, but no measures have hitherto been adopted to carry
it into effect.
  The general duration of the leases is for nineteen years, and the
farni-buildiDgs are in a superior style. The greater part of the
arable ground is enclosed with hedges and stone dikes, but many
of them are insufficient fences, and the enclosures are defective in
their subdivisions.  Every branch of agriculture has advanced ge-
nerally of late; but the property of Sir Patrick Murray of Odbter-
tyre has received the most elegant and substantial improvement,
in respect of farm-building, fences, and planting.  The chief ob-
stacles to improvement arise from the distance from manure, and
sea-ports, and, the depression in the value of the produce of the
soil, which represses thd enterprise and industry of the tenant.
   Quarries- On the lands of Abercairney and Cultoquhey, there
are two excellent quarries of durable sandstone, which admits of a
fine polish, and has a beautiful colour.  From them both the
mansion -houses on these estates have been recently built. Craig-
