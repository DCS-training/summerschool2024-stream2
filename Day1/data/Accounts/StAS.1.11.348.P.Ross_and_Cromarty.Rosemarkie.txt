but this they will not regret, if it turn out, as they expect, for
the general utility.  The rector teaches the Greek, Latin
English and French languages; the second master, arithmetic,
book-keeping, geography, all the branches of mathematics, na-
vigation, perspective drawing, etc.; and a third master is em-
ployed for initiating children in the elements of the Latin and
English languages, writing and arithmetic.

   Language.-It is somewhat remarkable, that in this, as
well as the neighbouring parishes of Cromarty and Avoch,
the ministers preach only in English, which is the common
language of the people; and it has been remarked by travel-
lers, that even the lower sort of them pronounce it with ease
and propriety.  In this parish, no Gaelic is to be found, but
among a few servants who come from the Highlands; and
they soon acquire the English by their residence here.  From
this, it should seem, that these parishes were not originally
peopled with natives of these northern regions, but by persons
who came by sea to settle here, invited by the pleasantness
and fertility of the country.  Among these, there has pro-
bably been a mixture of Danes.

   Eminent Men.-Sir GEORGE M'KENZIE of Rosehaugh, that
eminent statesman and able lawyer, passed a part of his time
at Fortrose, and had a particular attachment to it, on account
of its delightful walks and prospects.  Dr. GEORGE M'KEN-
ZIE, too, the laborious compiler of "the Lives of the most
"eminent Writers of the Scotch Nation," resided here, in an
old castle belonging to the Earl of Seaforth, and lies interred in
the tomb of that family in the cathedral.  And Dr. JAMES
M'KENZIE, who writes "the Art of preserving Health," is said
to have been for sometime employed in teaching the grammar
school of the burgh.
