to remove all these grievances, without any diminution of
rents, or passing from the value of customs and services.
These are things which the landlord considers, though in-
deed falsely, as great advantages, and will therefore by no
means dispense with them.  Well then, to gratify him, I

be also necessary in effecting so desirable a change.  Where-

which scarcely deserves the name; but there are several
families, who retail whisky and ale occasionally.  This
practice prevails too much, and is attended with many con-
sequences hurtful to the interest and morals of the people;
