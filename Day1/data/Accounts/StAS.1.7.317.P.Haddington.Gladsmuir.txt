   Landed Property, Agriculture, etc.-The parish is divided
amongst 15 landed proprietors, only three of whom reside
within its bounds.  It contains between 5 and 6000 acres of
land, of which 3000 are in tillage; above 500 acres are an-
nually sown with grass seeds; about 1600 are in pasture, and
above 200 in wood.  The real rent is about 4500 l. paid by
22 farmers, 4 of whom pay above 300 l. a year each, and 7
under 100 l.  The rents are wholly paid in money, the kane
and carriages, which were formerly exacted, being now con-
verted.
   One hundred and six two horse ploughs, and 240 horses,
are employed; 134 black cattle, and about 100 sheep are
kept.  Wheat, barley, oats, and pease, are the common pro-
duce of this district; cabbage and turnip crops are little
raised, nor are potatoes so much cultivated as perhaps they
ought to be, considering what a wholesome and cheap food
they yield to the lower class of people.

   Population, Employment, Sects, and Manners.-The villages
in this parish are 3 in number, and, by a singular coincidence,
they contain exactly 59 families each.  The number of fa-
milies in the whole parish is 340; of souls, 1380; of these
647 are males, 733 are females, 1010 are above 10 years of
age, and 370 are under 10.  By Dr Webster's table in 1755,
the numbers were 1415.  From the appearance of ruined
houses on the north side of the parish, an opinion has pre-
vailed, that the inhabitants were once more numerous than
they are now; but by a numeration which was made at the
first seating of the church in the year 1697, it appears that
the number of inhabitants then must have been under 1350.
The baptism roll, at an average for the last 30 years, gives
only 47 each year, which would denote a population consi-
derably inferior to that which is here given; but many who
