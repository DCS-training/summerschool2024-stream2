improving condition.  The catalogue of the commodities
which this country produces, and which are carried out of it,
either over seas or coastways, as well as of the articles
brought into it, is very considerable, as will appear evident

are generally exported are beef, pork, butter, tallow, hides,
calf skins, rabbit skins, salt fish, oil, feathers, linen yarn, and

wood, flax, coal, sugar, spirits, wines, snuff and tobacco,
flour and bisquit, soap, leather, hard-ware, broad-cloth,
printed linens, and printed cottons.  The imports, in the

Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh.  The value of the ex-

most commonly bring at the markets where they are sold;

and other traders.  To give a clear idea of the trade, three
years have been taken, 1770, 1780, and 1790; and the va-
lue of the imports and exports for these years, at the rates
above stated, is as follows:
