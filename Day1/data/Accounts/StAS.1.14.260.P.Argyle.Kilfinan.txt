no record nor tradition that says who possessed the pro-
perty before them.  Many of the clan still reside upon
the estate.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-All the lands in this pa-
rish are thirled to certain mills, to the extent of the 16th
part of the oats, the 11th part of the barley.  They
are also obliged to have their smith-work done by cer-
tain smiths; wich has a bad effect, as it ends to make
these tradesmen lazy and inattentive; indifferent whe-
ther they do their work sufficient or otherwise, being
sure, that the people cannot employ any but themselves.
In the northern district, they are obliged to pay full
multure to the miller, even for the barley they sell to
distillers out of the parish; which is a very great hard-
ship to the farmer, when there is not one in the lands
perhaps to buy it.  There are no manufactures carried
on in this parish, and probably never will, on account
of the scarcity of the fuel, which is one of the greatest
disadvantages the inhabitants lie under.  Another dis-
advantage is the want of a regular post and post-office
in the neighbourhood, having none nearer than Inve-
rary, which is near 30 miles from some parts of this
parish.  This puts us to the expense of employing a
runner once a-week; and the neighbouring parish of
Glendarual is in the same situation.  Glendarual is a
very centrical place for a post-office, for the whole of
the low part of Cowal, and in the middle of a straight
line of road between Inverary and Rothsay.  It would
be a very general good to plant a post-office there, and
the commerce between the two places could afford not
only to pay the post, but would probably return some
revenue to government.-Superstition is losing ground
