   Mills, etc.-In this, and the whole higher parts of Clydes-e
dale, there are no mills for grinding wheat, which is a great
disadvantage.  In this parish, however, there are 5 common
corn mills.  The first, and probably the only corn mills in this
country for some time, were those of Mauldslie, which per-
haps may have derived its name from molo, to grind.  The
mills of Mauldslie appear to have comprehended, at first, what
is now called Milton, and also 3 or 4 mills on the lower part
of Carluke Burn.  At that time, there was a wooden bridge
(the vestiges of which are yet visible), fitted up in the rocks
at Milton, to make the communication to these mills easier
from the south and west on the opposite side of the Clyde:
and farmers on the east, at the distance of about 7 miles,
were bound, by charters, to grind at the mills of Mauldslie.
It appears also, that, about 500 years ago, King Robert Bruce
was proprietor of these mills; for it is recorded, that he grant-
ed 10 merks Sterling, out of his mills of Maldslay (so it was
then written), for the purpose of keeping a lamp perpetually
burning upon the tomb of St. Machute at Lesmahago*.  There
was lately found, near the foot of the parish, the remains of a
hand-mill, which had been used for grinding before the period
of water mills.  It is a very large wain, or muir, stone, so
scooped into the form of a large bason, as to receive a lesser
stone corresponding to it, with a handle.

   Antiquities, Eminent Men, etc.-Some Scotch coins, as an-
cient as Alexander I. have been found in this parish, both at
Chapel-Yard, and St. Oswald's Chapel.  From S. E. to N. W.
runs the Roman Road, called here Watling's Street, (perhaps
a corruption of Vitellius's Street).  In some places, especially
at Killcaigow-Law, it is still so visible, that the manner of
