treme difficulty that they can rear and educate their families.  Few
of their children now learn the trade of weaving, or continue at it
after they have learned it, if they can find employment otherwise.
Their number is consequently diminishing. The condition of the
other operatives is in general comfortable.  The colliers and miners
exhibit the usual characteristics of these classes.

   Aqriculture.-There can scarcely be said to b e either moss,
moor, or morass in the parish.  In general the whole land is arable.
The soil is chiefly clay, variously mixed with loam, sand,
and till.  In some parts it is of a lighter mould.  It is very fertile
towards the Clyde, and there is much excellent land in other parts
of the parish.  In the west districts, manure is procured from Hamilton
and Glasgow.  It is supplied in the east by the villages
which are enlarging and multiplying with the public works.  From
the nature of the soil, and the declination of a great part of the
parish towards the Clyde, on the south, frequent showers are of
advantage, both in spring and summer.  In favourable seasons the
crops are abundant, and of excellent quality.
