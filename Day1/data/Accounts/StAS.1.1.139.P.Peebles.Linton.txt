   When the lambs are weaned, the ewes are milked for a
longer of shorter time, according to the richness of the pas-
ture; and the milk, mixed with the cow milk of the farm,
is made into cheese, which sells at about 6 s. per stone Tron.
Milking, however, is much disused.

   The names of sheep are as follow:
1st, Ewe, wedder, tup, lambs, until they are smeared.
2d, Ewe, wedder, tup, hogs, until they are shorn.
3d, Gimmers, dummons, tups, until they are shorn.
4th, Old ewes, wedders, tups.

   An intelligent herd knows all his sheep from persona ac-
quaintance, called bead mark, and can swear to the identity of
a sheep as he could to that of a fellow servant.  The artificial
mark made with a hot iron on the nose, or with a knife on
the ears, he considers as a very equivocal mark of identity,
like the cut or colour of a cot in the human species.

   Corn Farming.-The different species of oats sown at Lin-
ton are ranked as follows, according to their different degrees
of earliness:  1st, Magbichill oats, or barley oats, introduced
by Mr William Montgomery  of Magbiehill.  2d, Carnwath
oats from the moors of Carnwath:  They are 14 days latter
than the Magbiehill.  3d, Late feed oats from Tweedside,
10 or 14 days latter than the Carnwath oats.  They will 
grow on worse soil than the Magbiehill, but require strong-
er soil that the Carnwath.  A prejudice long prevailed, but
is now given up, that the meal of these was better than that
of the Magbiehill.

   The Lothian pea does not ripen in any year at Linton.
The Peebles grey pea ripens sometimes if sown in March.
