schoolmaster before his appointment to be superintendent, and who
still unites the duties of these two offices to those of the superin-
tendant), the system of domestic management of the establish-
ent has now been carried on for nearly two years, and the extent
as well as the nature of the benefits derivable from the institution
become more justly appreciated and more sensibly felt.
   In the first outset ofany institution, a considerable expense must
necessarily be incurred for furniture, &c.; while, on the other
hand, the income of an infant institution is generally short consi-
derably of what it afterwards reaches, when the public have become
aware of its claim3 on their support.  Hence, the expenditure of
the House of Refuge during the first seven months was L. 725,
while its income for the same period was only 191. Since that
time, two complete years have now elapsed, and the following is a
view of the financial concerns of the institution for these two years:
