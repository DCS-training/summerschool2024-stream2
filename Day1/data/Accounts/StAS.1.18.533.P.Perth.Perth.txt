   The dissenters of different kinds, are as follows:
   1. A small congregation of the old Scots Episcopals, which
has one minister.
   2. An English Episcopal chapel, which has one minister.
Several families from the country attend this chapel.
   3. A small society of Cameronians, who affect to be called
the old Scots Presbyterians.  They have no minister resident
among them.
   4. A small society of Anabaptists.  The principles they

the town.  It ought to be observed, in justice to the senior

   6. A congregation of Antiburgher Seceders, which has
ministers.  Many of the people, who attend in this congrega-

   7. A congregation of what are called Relief people, which
has 1 minister.  Many of the people who attend in this con-

not like the English independants in the time of Oliver Crom-
