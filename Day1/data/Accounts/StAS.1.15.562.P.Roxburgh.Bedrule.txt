river derived its name from the family of Rule, or from St
Rule, is uncertain; or, perhaps, from the rapidity of the
stream (for its stream is very rapid) it signifies Roul, (Roll)
as in some old papers it is also written.  Whether any of
these be the true derivation is doubtful.  But, it is most cer-
tain, that the chief of the family of Turnbull, a branch of
the very ancient family of Rule, had his principal residence
at Bedrule Castle, in ancient times, a strong hold, pleasantly
situated behind the church, on the bank of the river; situ-
ation equally remarkable for prospect, for safety, and for
beauty; from the site of which (for the castle itself was de-
molished some time ago) though its elevation above the bed
of the river be not very great, are seen distinctly, to the
North-west, the most elevated tops of some of the hills by
Ettrick and Yarrow, and the Eildons by Melrose Abbey;
the Reid Swyre to the South-East, the source of the Reid
and the Jed taking different directions, the Reid mixing
with the waters of Tyne, and falling into the sea at New-
castle; the Jed, with those of the Tiviot and Tweed, which
reach the sea at Berwick; and South-westward, the same
frontier tract from whence the Liddel derives its source,
which, after uniting with the Ewes and the Esk, falls into
the Selway Firth, a branch of the Irish Sea.  The view is
more confined towards the East and the West, yet the tops
of the Dunian and Ruberslaw* hills in the neighbourhood,
were situations most suitable in martial times, by the lighting
of fires, for giving the alarm to the dependents and friends
of the family, either for the purpose of defence or attack, on
the sudden approach of an enemy.
