	PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

		   I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name, Boundaries, &c.--THE name of this parish was ancient-
ly written Fernell, afterwards Fernwall or Farnwall; but now com-
monly Farnell. Fernell is said to be of Gaelic origin,--fern
signifying a den, and nell a swan; from which it would appear that
the name had been taken from a den near the church, which may

	It is bounded on the east by the parish of Marytown; on the
south by Rossie muir; on the west by the parishes of Kinnell and
Brechin; and on the north by the'parish of Brechin and the
river South Esk.

parish. Extending into the parishes of Marytown and Craig, there
is a ridge of hills, but of no considerable height. In these higher
grounds, as well as in the western district, which has been more
