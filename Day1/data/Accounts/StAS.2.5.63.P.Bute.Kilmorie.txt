makers charge 1s. 3d. with victuals for making a  pair of shoes;
servants receive the same wages that they do in Ayrshire.
	Fisheries,--The herring-fishery is carried on at the north end
to a considerable extent, and the white fishing on the south, but
on a very Ernited scare's owing partly to the want of enterprise, is
those who pursue it, and partly to the difficulty of getting the fish
carried fresh to market. There are no fisheries rented in the pa-
rish.
	Produce.--The average gross amount of raw produce raised
in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is, as follows:

	There are about 90 boats belonging to the parish. Of these
the largest is about twelve tons burthen, the average four and a-
half. Those engaged in the herring-fishing employ three men,
the others two.
	An agricultural society was instituted on the island, about eight
years ago, which, by its premiums for ploughing, rearing, and crop-
ping, has contributed, more than anything else, in forwarding the
improvements in stock and farming operations. It has excited
among the farmers a spirit of emulation which urged them
to make improvements that even self interest would not have im-

			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	There is neither market-town nor market in the parish. All
the disposable, produce must therefore be exported; to the oppo-
site towns of Ayr, Campbelton, and Ardrossan,--the highest of
which is twelve, and the most, distant eighteen miles of an open
and boisterous sea. There are no harbours; at least none which
a vessel can enter, except at high water, and the largest of them
will not, even then admit vessels of more than fifteen tons. There
is a packet-boat from Southend to Ayr, and another from Blank-
water to Campbelton, which have each of them a small salary,
levied from the tenantry in proportion to, and along with their rent.
At the former place tow converging whin dikes form a author-
basin, in which the packet lies, and at the latter, a small harbour
was constructed by the parliamentary commissioners. But neither
