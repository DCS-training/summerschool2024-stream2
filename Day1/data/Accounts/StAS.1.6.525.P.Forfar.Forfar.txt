the church door, which with the interests of certain savings in
former times of plenty, amounts to about L. 100 yearly.  Out
of these sums, besides a monthly distribution of about L. 6 or
L. 7 and occasional supplies in cases of urgent necessity, the
poor are furnished with shoes, clothing, and house rent-
Since the scarcity in the year 1783, when oat-meal was 20 s.
per boll, through the increase of the number of poor and
the rise of provisions, the funds which before were accummu-
lating have been scarcely adequate to the expenditure; and
new methods are now trying to render the supply of the indus-
trious poor more effectual, without increasing the burden of
the community.  The fact seems to be, that over-grown cha-
rity funds, are enemies to industry, as they encourage the idle
and improvident, to depend upon them as a security against
want in the evening of life.  And so they will neither work
nor save.  For many years preceding the year 1788, provisions
were more easily obtained by the poor, than now, by the
great quantities of fresh fish with which the market of Forfar
was supplied at very reasonable prices, by carriers who gained
a livelyhood by bringing them almost daily from the sea-port
towns.  A supply which had its influence also on the price of
meat.  But since the year 1788 fish have been very scarce; the
haddocks particularly have left our  coasts entirely, and one great
article for the subsistance of the poor, as well as a luxury for
the rich, is withdrawn.
   There is a weekly market held in Forfar every Saturday; it
is well attended, and a great deal of country business is transac-
ted there.  A branch of the Dundee Banking Company, and
one of the commercial Bank Company of Aberdeen, have been
established here for these two or three years, and both have
considerable employ*.
