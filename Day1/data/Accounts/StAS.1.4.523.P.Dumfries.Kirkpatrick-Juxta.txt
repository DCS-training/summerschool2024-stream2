and some parts of which are still standing to the height of
20 feet, are no less than 15 feet in thickness.  The sort
had been supplied with water by a leaden pipe, part of
which was lately dug up.  The place is strong by nature,

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people in general are
quiet, sober and contented.  No murder, suicide nor rob-
bery, is known to have happened in the parish.-Almost
every family spins coarse cloth for its own use; but unfor-

small farm, moderately rented, 6 or 8 times the amount of
the rent is sometimes paid as entries.  There are particu-

one.  Clocks, mostly of wood, are also very common.  Se-
venty years ago, there was not a pane of glass, except in
