they seem to think it, by throwing corn farms into the size of
L. 1000 a year, or upwards, proprietors will annihilate, in a
great measure, the class of farmers; and may find it difficult,
at no distant day, to get persons possessed of stock and abilities
for such undertakings, as too great a reduction of the number of
farmers must operate as powerfully, as the diminutive size of
farms, against a spirit of emulation and improvement.

   Roads, Changes of Property, Wood, etc.-Before the year
1770, the roads were so bad, that in many places they were
impassable in winter; and, at no season of the year, could
more than 5 bolls of grain be sent to market upon a two horse
cart.  But, in consequence of an Act of Parliament, for the
county, levying 20 s. from every ploughgate of land, they are
now in so good repair, that 10 bolls are the common load.
They were made more easily, however, that gravel was at no
great distance, and the soil admitted of their being formed by
the plough.  For the purpose of keeping them in repair, the
tenants, who have fields of sown grass in their neighbourhood,
are allowed 2 d. for each cart load of stones which they gather
upon them, and are besides paid for the carriage.
   Property has fluctuated much in this parish of late.  This
has been the case with none more than the barony of Keith;
which, together with Inch-Keith and other lands, were given,
along with the office of Hereditary Great Marishal of Scot-
land, by King Malcolm, to one Robert, as a reward for kill-
ing, with his own hand, Camus the king and champion of the
Danes, at the battle of Barry, in the year 1010.  From these
lands Robert took the firname of Keith, and they remained in
the possession of the family till they were sold for the purpose
of affording aid to General Leslie.
