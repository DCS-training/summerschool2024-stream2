terests of commerce, government, and humanity.

   Miscellaneous Observations, Antiquities, etc.-I here are two
villages in this parish, Garliestown, founded by the present
Earl of Galloway when Lord Garlies.  It is in the form of a
crescent.  It contains about 450 inhabitants.  The other vil-
lage is Sorbie, also begun through the encouragement of the
present Earl, in which there are about 80 inhabitants.

   A tumulus, was opened in part by some road makers,
and human bones were found in it.  Near it, and close by
Hunters, or Rigg Bay, were also found human bones, inclo-
sed by three stones;  and upon one of the stones there seem-
ed to be an inscription.  There are the remains of two cas-
tles, Crugleton and Eagerness.  An unornamented arch, and
some other parts of the ruins of Crugleton, shew it to have
been a place of great size and strength.  The fosse remains
very plain.  This casile is said to have been the dwelling of
the very ancient and wealthy family of the Vauses, now Van-
ses, of Barnbarrow.  Crugletton is now the property of Sir
Stair Agnew of Lochnaw, Bart.  Eagerness is altogether de-
stroyed.  The terminations of the names of these castles shew
them to be of Saxon original.  Ness, in that language, signi-
fies an headland, or promontory; ton is derived  from a word
in the same language which signifies an hedge or wall; and
that word, again, seems to be from one signifying a hill.  Ea-
gerness is a headland:  Crugleton is upon a hill;  and seems
to signify a town upon a hill, surrounded by a wall.  There
is a rope walk at Garliestown, well conducted; and ten coast-
ing vessels belong to that port.
