     Statistical Account

within these last 12 years, are by some conjectured to proceed
from volcanic eruptions from the bottom of the Atlantic
ocean.

   State of Property.-The old valued rent of the parish is
3183 L. Scotch.  The present rental cannot be precisely stated:
Access cannot be easily had to the knowledge of the rent of
some farms; several grounds are in the natural possession of
the proprietors: It may probably be somewhat between 2500 L.
and 3000 L.  There are 22 heritors, some of whom have pro-

sown ryegrass, and red and white clover seeds: After one
crop of hay is taken, the ground is pastured 4 or 5 years be-

imported from Cumberland, at 1 s. the Carlisle bushel.  Shells
are found in great abundance on the shore, and have also
been much used, hut are experienced to be rather too stimu-

excellency of shells, as a manure, is for breaking or loosening
a stiff clay, or a heavy wet soil.  The farmers here, and all
