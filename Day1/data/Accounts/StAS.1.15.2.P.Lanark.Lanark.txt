     Statistical Account

banks of the Moufs, the only other river of any size,
and which running from East to West, separates the
parish into two distinct parts, are equally precipitous
and rocky, but also clothed with natural wood, and
plantations of forest trees.
   The highest ground in the parish, for there is no hill,
is Lanark and Lee moors, both being pretty equal in
height, and about 760 feet above sea level.  The town
of Lanark itself is 656 feet 5 inches above the quay at the
new bridge of Glasgow.
   The parish may contain above 6000 acres.  There are
probably upwards of 600 acres of coppice wood and plan-
tations, and 1800 acres of moor ground, which leaves a-
bout 3600 acres for cultivation.  The moory grounds,
which also contain some little moss, belong to two differ-
ent proprietors.  Lanark moor, consisting of about 1500
acres, is the property of the community: and Lee-moor
consisting of about 300 acres belongs to the estate of Lee.
About 50 years ago the magistrates of Lanark, let to the
inhabitants of the burgh on leases of 57 years, several
small lots, at the extremity of their moor or common, at
from 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d per acre, with the view of getting
them inclosed and improven; but the distance from town,
about two miles, and other circumstances, prevented
much improvement from being made upon them: such
lots however as were situated highest the town, and have
been kept fencible, now let from 10 s. to 20 s. per acre.
About 20 years ago, the town planted about 60 acres of
this moor, mostly with Scots pines, which are in a very
thriving condition; and their seeds, scattered by the wind
have of late produced a natural and extensive crop of
young pines in the moor.

lately feued from the magistrates between 2 and 300 acres
