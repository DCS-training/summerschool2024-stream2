  Agriculture, &c.-From a measurement of the property of the
principal heritor, supposed correct, and said to be of the year
1815, and from information given as to the other properties in the
parish, the land of the parish seems to be laid out as follows:

	Since 1815 much has been done in draining and bringing under
the plough all improvable land on the estate of the principal heri-
tor, so that at this date a very considerable extent of what was then
pasture is now arable ground. But little now remains uncultivated
which is capable of being profitably brought under cultivation. The
Hill of Hatton is ploughed almost to its summit; on the north of
the parish, where standing water, marsh, and morass were, corn
fields now are; and on the south, the hand of industry  has been
equally at work, especially on the estate of Couston, farmed by its
proprietor, whose improvements are of a very marked character.
  Woods.-The parish, upon the whole, has but a small extent of
ground under plantation, which consists chiefly of larch and
Scotch firs, intermixed in some places with different kinds of
hard-wood trees. There plantations appear to thrive well. Towards
the north of the parish, along the roads and in hedge-rows
forming divisions of fields, trees have been planted, which are
now of considerable age, and agreeably diversify the aspect of the
country. There is a small copse of natural  birch wood on the
