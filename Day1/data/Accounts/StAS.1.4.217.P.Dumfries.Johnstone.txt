one end  of it, it has been called Annandale.  The soil is
chiefly of three kinds.  The higher lands are generally
deep moss or clay, and on the banks of Annan the land is
light and sandy.  Great part, or rather most of it, is rich
and good, though till of late much neglected, and needs on-
ly culture to make it produce the most luxuriant crops.

great rains and frequent fogs, the ague seldom appears.

the neighbouring hills happen to be suddenly thawed, the
Annan sometimes overflows its banks, and does consider-

of rain come together, they generally produce an inunda-
tion of this sort, which is frequently much increased by a
strong south wind, which blowing in opposition to the ri-
ver, dams up its water.  It seldom overflows from rain a-
lone.  The most remarkable instances of the swelling of
