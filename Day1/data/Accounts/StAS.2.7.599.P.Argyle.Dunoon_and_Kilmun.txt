 committed by certain leaders of the Campbells, in the vicinity of
 the castle. The statement of those atrocities, as exhibited in the
 indictment against the Marquis of Argyle, may fairly be consid-
 ered as not at least underrated. The public prosecutor of the
 day has recourse even to popular superstitions to aid in vilifying
 the character of the accused party. But, making all allowances
 for exaggeration,it is too abundantly certain, while the noble de-
 fendant pleads his having been no party to these atrocities, that
 they were of no ordinary type: and, whatever may have been the
 innocency of the Marquis of Argyle  personally in this most infa-
 mous transaction, it is but too evident, that the leaders of his clan
 took advantage of existing  turmoils to wage a war of extermination
 against the clan Lamont. The indictment of the Marquis of Argyle
 bears, that certain of his clan having besieged and forced to a
 surrender the houses of Toward and Escog, then the property
 of Sir James Lamont, having violated the terms of the capi-
 tulation on which the surrender was made, " did most treacher-
 ously, perfidiously, and traitorously fetter and bind the hands of
 near 200 persons of the said Sir James's friends and followers,
 who were comprehended within the said capitulation, detaining
 them prisoners with a guard, their hands being bound behind their
 backs like thieves, within the said Sir James's house and yards of
 Towart, for the space of several days, in great torment and misery;"
 and, " in pursuance of their farther villany, after plundering and
 robbing all that was within and about the said house, they most
 barbarously, cruelly, and inhumanly murdered several, young and
 old, yea, sucking children, some of them not one month old." And
 again, "The said persons, defendants, or one or others of them,
 contrary to the foresaid capitulations, our laws, and acts of Par-
 liament, upon the - day of June 1646, most traitorously and
 perfidiously did carry the whole people who  were in the said houses
 of Escog and Towart, in the said boats, to the village of Dunoone,
 and there most cruelly, traitorously, and perfidiously cause hang
 upon one tree near the number of thirty-six persons, most of them
 being special gentlemen of the name of Lamont, and vassals to the
 said Sir James. " And, after enumerating these persons, the in-
 dictment proceeds to enumerate others, who were likewise " bar-
 barously, inhumanly, and unchristianly murdered with dirks, and
 cut down with swords and pistols; " and " John Jamison, then
 Provost of Rothesay, who, being shot thrice through the body.
