	Dairy produce.--The yearly average profit of milk cows in 1791
was L. 3, at present it is nearer L. 9, and taking the number of dairy
cows kept at 300, the average profit from this source alone will be
L. 2700. The farmers find it more advantageous to make their milk
into butter than into cheese; of which last they make no more than
is sufficient for the supply of their own families. Almost all the
butter And churned milk they can spare is sold in Glasgow. The
cows are nearly all of the improved Ayrshire breed. A good cow
will yield 4000 quarts of milk per annum; but take the average
amount at 3000 quarts, and we will have from 300 cows 900,000
quarts. About 16 quarts produce one pound of butter, and of course
900,000 quarts will yield 56875 pounds, which at 1s. per, pound
will amount to L. 2843, 15s. The pint of butter milk, containing
two quarts, is sold at a penny, and of course 900,000 will yield
L. 1375. This, however, is only a gross calculation, and does not
pretend to be minutely accurate. The real gross amount is pro-
bably much higher. The keep of a cow may on an average be
L. 10, 10s. perannum, and the grassing of 300 cows will be L.900.
The profit arising from the different modes of conducting the
dairy produce may be estimated as follows:

	In 1791, the parish was in the hands of about 50 farmers; at
present, there are only about 41. The rentals in 1791 and in 1836
stand as follows:
