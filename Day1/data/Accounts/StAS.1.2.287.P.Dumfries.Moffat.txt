clouds discovers a sky of a beautiful azure; and this, together
with the dryness of the soil, it is believed, contribute greatly
to health.  Fevers seldom make their appearance in Moffat;
and are generally much milder than in the lower parts of An-
nandale.  Agues are not known.  The people in general en-
joy good health.  Many live beyond 80, and some beyond 90
years.

   Lake.-Lochskeen is the only lake in the parish.  It is 1100
yards in length, of unequal breadth.  Where broadest, about
400 yards.   The depth is not known.  There is a small island
in it, where the eagles bring out their young in great safety;
as the water is deep, and no boat upon the lake.-The only
fish in Lochskeen are fresh water trout, generally large; some
of them 11 inches long, which are very fine in the season.  The ri-
vers in the parish are plentifully stocked with trout of the
same kind; and a species much smaller, sea-trout, also, some-
times come up the rivers in summer, and a few salmon.

derable rivulet; and, after running near three quarters of a
mile, falls from one precipice to another, from a great height,
dashing and foaming, and thundering, between two high, steep,
and rocky hills; forming the cascade known by the name of 
Grey Mare's Tail.  It is seen to the greatest advantage af-
ter a heavy rain; when it appears like one unbroken sheet of
water, from top to bottom.

Antiquities.-The rivulet, a little before it falls into the
Moffat, has carried away a part of a circle, in form of a Dru-
id temple; a small portion of which, however, still remains.
   The Roman road, from Esk to Stirling, passed through part
of this parish, to the west of the village of Moffat.  The ves-
