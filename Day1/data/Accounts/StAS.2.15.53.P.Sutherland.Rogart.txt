62,800 acres in extent. Probably 1000 acres might yet be added
to the cultivated land.
   Husbandry.-The pasture for sheep is good, and the sheep
reared on it are said to be of the best quality of their kind. Sur-
face draining, which has been carried on to a great extent, has
added much to the quantity, and improved the quality, of feeding
for sheep. In this species of improvement, little remains to be now
done here by the sheep-farmer. Large farms are let on leases of
nineteen, and small lots on leases of seven, years.
   Live-Stock.-The number of sheep of all kinds is 6420; of
black cattle, (heads of,)107; of horses, 276 ; of pigs, 210.

  Woods.-Timber as yet cannot he mentioned as one of the pro,
ducts of the parish of Rogart. A small space in Strathfleet, about
twenty acres, having some native plants of oak, was enclosed, and
planted with larch and common fir. The appearance of this small
plantation, which has been lately thinned for the first time, affords
sufficient encouragement for planting in situations equally favour-
able; of which situations the sides of that strath, and several other
parts in the parish, present many. Small alders are to be seen along
the streams; and patches of dwarf birch are common. Both of
these, when in foliage, enliven the aspect, and relieve the ruder
features of the scenery ; but otherwise they are of no value.
   Produce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can he ascertained, is as
follows:-
