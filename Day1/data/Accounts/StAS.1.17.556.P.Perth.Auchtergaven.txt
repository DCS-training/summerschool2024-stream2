     Statistical Account

   A turnpike road from Perth to Dunkeld is now complet-
ed.  In entering the parish, it takes a different direction
from the old roads, and is conducted through the cultivated
ground.  Most of the new built houses and farm steads were
designedly situated near it, or within view of it, which is not
only extremely convenient for the farmers but also tends to
decorate and enliven the appearance of the country.
   In the year 1784, Mr Dempster of Dunnichen, Mr Graham
of Fintray, along with several gentlemen in the mercantile
line in Perth, feued some ground at Stanley from the Duke
of Atholl, built a mill for spinning cotton, and soon after be-
gan to erect a village in its neighbourhood, upon a regular plan,
for accommodating the people to be employed in this manu-
factory.  At that time, only a few families dwelt near Stan-
ley; and, except the land within the inclosures around Stan-
ley House* , most part of it, thereabout, was almost in a state
of nature.  His Grace the Duke of Atholl took under his
own management 250 acres of this land, inclosed it, built
upon it an elegant farm stead; and, within the course of a
few years, improved it so highly, that not long ago, this farm
was let at the rate of 1 l. 5 s. per acre.
   Near an hundred families now reside in the village at
Stanley.  Above 350 persons are employed about the cotton
mill,-of this number 300 are women or children under
16 years of age.  The boys and girls, though confined at
work in the mill for many hours of the day, and, at times,
during the night, are, in general, very healthy.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Stanley House is beautifully situated upon the banks of
the river Tay, in the eastern part of this parish.  It was built
by the late Lord Nairn.  The family of Nairn had another
elegant house near Loak, the ruins of which are yet to be seen.
Their place of interment is in the south isle of Aughtergaven
church.
