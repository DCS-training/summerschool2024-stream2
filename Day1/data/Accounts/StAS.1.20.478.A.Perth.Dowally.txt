     Statistical Account

   When the peats of the year are stored up, the hay-harvest
begins.  By the middle of August, or earlier, the flax is
ready to be pulled, and the ripling, watering, and preparing
it for the mill, occupies all hands till the 15th or 20th of
September, when the barley is ripe for cutting.  The la-
bours of reaping and housing their crops now commence,
and they proceed till they are closed by the raising of the
potatoes, in the end of October or beginning of November.
From this time, till they begin to rib the ground for their
barley crop in spring, the men have no severer employment
than thrashing for daily use the scanty quantity of straw
which the cattle require, and for carrying to them what
other provender their improved cultivation has enabled
them to preserve for that season.
   Excepting the barony of Dalcapon, all the lands in the
parish are thirled to the mill of Dowally.  The multure
paid is 6 lippies of sheeling for the boll, and 1 lippie besides
to the miller.

     OAK WOODS

   The computed extent of the oak woods has been already
stated.  The Duke of Atholl causes his woods to be cut
every 25th year only.  Other neighbouring proprietors cut
theirs every 20th year.  The value of oak woods has in-
creased of late very rapidly.  In this parish there is a re-
markable instance of this.  The wood of Gauy, at 3 suc-
cessive sales, within a period of 50 years, reckoning from
the date of the first to the date of the last sale, was disposed
of by roup at the following prices:  1st Sale, L. 166,
2 d Sale, L. 551; and 3 d Sale, L. 1262.  In some cases, the
price has been equal to L. 54 per acre; but the average
price per acre may be rated at L. 4 c.  This affords a high
rent for the ground, even for every year during which it
