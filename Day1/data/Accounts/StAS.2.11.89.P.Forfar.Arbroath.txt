           cupies its whole extent, with the exception of the small croft of Barn
           Green, and the streets within the former precincts of the Abbey.
           In 1831, the population of the country part of the royalty was
           319, and of the town part 5485; leaving 1139 as the population
           of the district which is without the royalty. But, in order to show
           the actual extent of the town and its connected suburbs, it is ne-
           cessary to include that portion of the latter which is situated in the
           adjoining parish of St Vigeans. The population, at different pe-
           riods, will then appear as follows:

              The date of the erection of Arbroath into a royal burgh cannot
           now be ascertained.  The most ancient charter extant is one grant-
           ed by James VI. in the year 1599; wherein the town is recogniz-
           ed as having previously enjoyed similar privileges. It has been
           pretended that these privileges were originally bestowed by King
           William the Lion, the founder of the abbey. But, in point of
           fact, before the Reformation, Arbroath appears to have been
           merely the abbot's burgh; one of the two bailies, by whom the
           town was governed, having been chosen by the abbot. The head
           of the Airly family is said to have been heritable bailie of regality,
           or acknowledged as such, for many years. According to the sett
           of the burgh, the magistrates and town-council must not consist of
           more than nineteen, nor of fewer than seventeen, persons; and the
           number must be made up of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild,
           and treasurer, with the addition of the convener of the incorpo-
           rated trades, and two trades councillors,-the other nine or eleven
           being guild councillors. For a considerable period previous to the
           year 1766, the administration of the affairs of the burgh appears
           to have been extremely corrupt. An oath of secrecy was taken
           and subscribed by the faction then in power; while an extravagant
           expenditure had brought the town into, a state of insolvency. By
           prudent management, the funds of the burgh have since been raised
           to a sufficiently flourishing condition. The public debt is, in-
           deed, considerable,--amounting to L. 16,000.  But the income is
           L. 3000; L. 1400 of which arise from the harbour dues; while
