to them; from which it is evident, that it contributes to the 
interest of the proprietor to give long leases, as well as to
the happiness of the tenant; for, at the expiration of such
leases, a double rent can be afforded to be given.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The sea weeds, commonly used
as manure, are the tang and kelp ware, which are got in 
abundance.  But besides these, there is another kind of ware,
resembling kelp ware, of an unctuous appearance, so very
rich, that it must be cut into small pieces, and spread thin,
otherwise the crop would be too luxuriant.  It is called, in
Gaelic, semman nam portan, (crab ware) from the number of
crabs that are found amongst it.  Notwithstanding the great
quantity of ware, there is but little kelp made in this parish.
-There are numbers of small stones, found in the Rabbit
Island, of a rusty colour, which here and there emit broken
rays of light, and are supposed to be garnet.  Mr M'Kay of
Bighouse has got a specimen of them.-Thunder and light-
ning are frequent; but seldom followed with any pernicious
consequences.  About 60 years ago, there were two men kil-
led by lightning near Torrisdale.  As this is not a corn
country, there is not one ale-house in the parish.  There is
only one inn, near the church, where good entertainment
can be got.  This paucity of public houses has most salutary
effects on the morals of the people.  It is now a rare thing
to see a man drunk among them; whereas, in the memory
of many, when the smuggling trade prevailed, and foreign
liquor abounded in every district, outrages of different kinds
were most daringly committed.  During the course of the
year 1790, no person has been committed to any jail from
this parish; nor has any criminal prosecution been commen-
ced against any in it, from time immemorial, one instance
only excepted.
