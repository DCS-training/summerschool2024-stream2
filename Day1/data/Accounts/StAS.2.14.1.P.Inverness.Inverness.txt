     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Name.-FROM the earliest periods, this parish seems to have
borne its present name, which is Celtic, and is supposed to refer
to the celebrated Fall of Foyers, which discharges its streams into
Loch Ness, (Loch 'an Ess, i. e. the Lake of the Cataract,) and
thence through the River Ness to the sea.
   Extent, &c.-The parish stretches along the coast of the Moray
Frith, and its prolongation the Beauly Frhth. Its length, from
north-east to south-west, is 14 miles; and its average breadth about
2 1/2. It is bounded on the north-east by the friths; on the west
by the parishes of Kirkhill, Kiltarlity, and Urquhart; south-west,
by Loch Ness and the parish of Dores; south and south-east by the
parishes of Daviot and Croy; and on the east by the parish of
Petty.
   Topograpihical Appearances.-The parish of Inverness consists
chiefly of the eastmost portion of the great Caledonian valley, or
"Great Glen of Albin," as it lies between the basin of the  Moray
Frith, which is the prolongation of that opening, and the waters of
Loch Ness.  It is also flanked on each side by the terminating
chains of mountains which bound the Great Glen, and which con-
stitute the only rocky or hilly parts of the parish.  The surface
of the valley, which is smooth and but little elevated above the pre-
sent level of the sea, except where diversified by the alluvial hil-
locks and terraces afterwards described, contains, of course, the
richest and best cultivated lands in the parish.
