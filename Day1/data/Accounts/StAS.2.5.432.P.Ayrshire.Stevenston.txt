     Meteorology.--A register of the state of the barometer and ther-
mometer, and of the wind and weather, has been kept for some
years at the Manse. It is marked once a day, and the hour of
marking is 10 o'clock, A. M. The Manse is only a mile from the
sea, but it is placed on an elevated ridge above the village; and as
the thermometer is 9 feet above the surface of the ground, on the
outside of a window facing the north, it is in all 72 feet above the
level of the sea at high-water. It is occasionally marked at the
hottest time of the day, and at the coldest time of the evening or
morning. It has only once, for seven years, been observed so high
as 84&deg;, and only once so low as 18&deg;.
     August 18, 1835, at 4 o'clock, P. M., the thermometer stood at
82&deg; in the sun, and at 72&deg; in the sliade. When water was pumped
on it from the manse well, 22 feet deep, it fell to 50&deg;. August

open air stood at 56&deg; and when water was pumped on it from
the well, it fell to 49&deg;.
     February 19, 1835, at 7 o'clock in the morning, the thermo-
meter at the bottom of the Turf-dike coal-pit, which is 408 feet
deep, stood at 56&deg;. When taken fifty yards into the workings, on
the same level, where there is no current of air, it rose to 58&deg;. In
the running water at the bottom of the pit it stood at 54&deg;. In the
open air at the pit mouth it stood at 36&deg;; and when plunged into
the canal it stood at 36&deg;.
     July 8, 1835. 8 o'clock in the morning, the thermometer at the
bottom of the Turf-dike coal-pit stood at 61&deg;. In the open air
at the pit-mouth it stood at 60&deg;.

meter at the bottom of the Turf-dike pit stood at 60&deg;. When
taken 300 yards into the workings it rose to 64&deg;; at the pit mouth
it fell to 31&deg;. When plunged into water in the open air, it rose
to 32&deg;. When plunged into water 300 yards into the workings be-
low, it rose to 64&deg;.
     December 28, 1836, at 6 o'clock in the morning, the thermo-
meter at the bottom of No. 5 coal-pit stood at 61&deg;. When taker
