     The line of coals above-mentioned bears in a direction pa-
rallel to the limestone. There are nineteen seams of these coals.
Towards Coaltown they gradually flatten and occupy a greater
surface of country. Beyond Kinninmont the coals are broken up,
and some of them driven aside by the eruption of the trap hill of
Ladedda. The thick coal and other five of the seams are tossed
up to the top of the hill of Drumecarro, where they are regularly
wrought. The south slope of Ladedda-hill has many marks of
old pits upon it, proving that the coals pass along there. The
limestone which runs parallel with the line of coal is wrought re-
gularly at present, in four different quarries. There is the Tequ-
liats quarry; there are two on Teasses property, and one at La-
dedda.
     1.The Tequliats lime is wrought by tirring. It is of a spark-
ling gray colour, and crystalline. It is 11 feet 6 inches thick,
and in three beds. Organic remains are exceedinly rare in this
quarry. The strata above the limestone are 2 feet 6 inches of
sklut, then 18 feet of shale-containing a good deal of pyrites,
which sometimes also occurs in the limestone. Above the share
are 5 feet of sandstone, and 4 feet of alluvium. This limestone fol-
lows the coal, all the way to Craighall, where it has been wrought.
About six men are generally employed in this quarry. They reckon
the dip to be I fathom in 4 to S. E.
     2. There is the Woodtop quarry or Teasses middle limestone.
It is compact, and of a bluish gray colour, contains corallines and
encrinites, and is less dark tban-the former limestone. The strata
above it are 4 feet 6 inches of inferior limestone or sklut, in which
are numerous fissures filled with beautiful incrustations of calcareous
spar; and where the fissures are large, stalactites, and stalagmites
of a dazzling whiteness are formed. Above the sklut, there are 20
feet of shale, and l foot of alluvium. This limestone is also wrought
by tirring. It is 10 feet thick, and in four beds. It dips about 1
fathom in 4. It has been worked for about thirty years, and from
ten to fifteen men are employed in it. It is used for laying on
