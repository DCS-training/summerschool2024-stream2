pay his trisling rent and servant's wages, and to procure for

   To emancipate the inhabitants of this country from a state
of barbarism, and to rouse a spirit of industry, was a bold and
arduous enterprise.  A gentleman, distinguished by his rank;
fortune, and public spirit, undertook and accomplished the
task.  With a zeal and perseverance becoming an enlighten-
ed and liberal mind, he formed plans of improvement, inclo-
sed farms with proper fences, banished sheep from infield
grounds, combated the prejudices of his tenants, furnished
them with marl, distributed premiums, and otherwise re-
warded their exertions.  The good effects of those measures
soon appeared; and other proprietors imitated the example.
In a few years, improvements were dissused through the 
whole country.  The tenants, as if awaked out of a profound
sleep, looked around, beheld his fields clothed with the rich-
est harvests, his herds fattening in luxuriant pastures, his fa-
mily decked in gay attire, his table loaded with solid fare,
and wondered at his former ingorance and stupidity.  The
landlord rejoiced in the success of his schemes, and shared in
the honours and profits of this new erection.  The manufac-
turer, mechanic, and tradesman, redoubled their efforts to
supply the increasing demand for dthe conveniencies and ele-
gancies of life.
