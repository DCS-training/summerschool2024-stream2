The latter is an endowed school, in connection with, and under
the superintendence of, the Church of Scotland. It seems to
have been instituted shortly after 1663, by an act of the presbytery
of Perth, dated October 3d 1660, which was afterwards confirmed
by the Privy-Council in the year 1663, empowering the heritors
to uplift the vacant stipend of 1659, and appropriate it to the
formation and endowment of a school at the Path of Condie.
The money thus raised is laid out at interest for the behoof of
the teacher. This sum, however, is small; but the last incum-
bent of the parish, Mr Willison, bequeathed a small field for its
support, which, with a house upon it, yields L.7, 10s. annually.
   The parochial schoolmaster's salary is the maximum; and the
probable amount of fees paid to him yearly is about L.35. His
other emoluments arise from the office of session-clerkship.
   Both of the above schools are very efficiently taught. The
teachers have adopted the most approved modern methods of in-
struction.
   There are also two Sabbath schools in the parish, which are
attended by 70 or 80 children.
