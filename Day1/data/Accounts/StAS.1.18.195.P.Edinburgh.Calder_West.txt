     of West-Calder.

   From the above table of population, it appears, that the
average number to a family, is 4 and near 4/16; and that the
males and females, are as 16 to 17.  In the account of Sece-
ders, none are reckoned below 9 years of age*.  Of those Se-
ceders, 142 are Antiburghers, 169 Burghers, 7 are connect-
ed with the presbytery of Relief, and 3 are Cameronians.
   The causes of separation from the established church have
been extremely various in this parish.  In consequence of the
last settlement, from 40 to 50 persons, have joined the Se-
cession.  Of those separated from the church for the last 10
years before this period, the strictness of the church disci-
pline seems to have been the chief cause.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish.-This parish, previous to
the year 1646, was a part of the parish of Mid-Calder, and
had a chapel belonging to it, at a place which still retains the
name of Chapelton; about a mile east from the village of
West-Calder.  The present proprietor, (Mr Gloag), has now
in his possession a large hollow stone, which seems to have
been the font of the chapel.
   In the year 1647, the commissioners for the plantation of
kirks, and valuation of teinds, valued the teinds of the parish
of Calder Comitis, which included the parishes of Mid and
West-Calders; and allocated the whole teinds as stipend to
the ministers of the two parishes.  The minister's stipend is
paid in money, and amounts to 800 merks; together with
50 merks for communion elements, and 30 merks for grass.
In addition to this, the glebe consists of twenty Scots acres.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The numbers stated of this parish in 1755, were 2396; no more than
1289, are now mentioned.  But as none are here reckoned among the Seceders
below 9 years of age, the diminution must in some degree, be attributed to
this circumstance.
