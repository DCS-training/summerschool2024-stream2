   Agriculture and Produce.-The crops consist of oats, barley,
and potatoes.  Some few farmers raise a little wheat and
rye.  Some, too, sow turnips, which seem to agree very well
with our soil.  A very few plant field-cabbages, and sow small
quantities of grey pease.  Most of the farmers in this district
sow red clover and rye grass, with barley, for cutting, the
greatest part of which is consumed by their own horses.
They also begin to lay out their grounds much richer than
formerly, and sow them with white clover and stable feeds
for pasture, and find themselves well repaid.  The soil of
this parish, however, seems to be too light and thin, in gene-
ral, for producing wheat in sufficient quantities to indemnify
the farmer for his labour and expence.  They sow wheat
after a potatoe fallow, a summer fallow, or after turnips,
which had been sown in the drill way; and, after all the
pains and expence bestowed on a summer fallow, it hardly
brings them 10 L. per acre, which is scarcely two thirds of
what an acre of wheat in a wheat country would fetch. Most
farmers low a little lintseed for their own use.  A consider-
able quantity of potatoes is carried to Dumfries market, 6
miles distant from the center of this parish, or to sloops at
different parts of the Solway Frith, about 5 or 6 miles from
hence.  Oats and barley are the chief grains the farmers, in
general, depend upon for paying their rent; and they raise a
considerable quantity of both, of an excellent quality.  A
good deal of hemp was railed and spun in this parish 40
years ago.  At present, there is very little to be seen.  There
is no land in common in the district, every proprietor and
every tenant knowing his own property.  There is very lit-
tle waste ground, the above moss excepted, which affords
