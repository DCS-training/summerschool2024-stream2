session register, that between the years 1720 to and 1730, the
number of births each year, at an average, was from 20 to
24 the number of marriages from 4 to 7, and the number
of deaths from 12 to 16; from which it should seem, that
the population then was nearly as great as at present.
There are two circumstances which have tended much to
diminish the population here, as well as in several places
of this neighbourhood, the monopoly of farms, and the dif-
ferent mode of farming which has of late years been adopt-
ed.  There are in this parish sundry instances of two or
more farms having been joined into one, which must occa-
sion a diminution of tenures; and as several of the farmers
now make use of hired servants in place of cottagers, and
plough with one man and two horses, in place of two men
and four horses formerly used; this, likewise, though no
doubt a more oeconomical scheme, is less favourable to po-
pulation, and tends to the decrease of numbers.  Owing to
these causes, the number of individuals would be reduced
below what it formerly was, were it not for two other cau-
ses, proving more than an overbalance, the limeworks at-
ready mentioned, and some bleachfields, etc. in the district
of Logie, which afford employment to a considerable num-
ber of hands.  The amount of the population in the month
of February this year (1791) was about 999 individuals,
of whom 469 were males, 530 females.  None reside in
towns, one family excepted, who generally reside for some
months during the winter season in Montrose.  There is
likewise a lady with her maid-servant, not included in the
above amount, who reside during the summer in the old
manse of Logie.  There are only two places in the parish,
which, with any sort of propriety, can be called villages,
viz.  North Water Bridge, and Mains of Craigo, the one
containing only about 70 individuals, and the other about
60, The annual average of births for 7 years last past,
