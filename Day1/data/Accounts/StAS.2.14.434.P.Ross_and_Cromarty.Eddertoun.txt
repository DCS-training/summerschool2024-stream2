breadth.  It is bounded on the east and south by the parishes of
Tain, Logie-Easter, Kilmuir-Easter, and Rosskeen; on the west,
by the parish of Kincardine; and the Dornoch Frith washes its
coast on the north.
  Topographical Appearances.-The principal expanse of the pa-
risb, containing most of the arable land, consists of three ledges,
surrounded by hills,-the Hill of Eddertoun or Cambuscurry
(Camus-Cari, the harbour of Carius,) to the east, Cnoc-an-t-sabh-
al (the hill of the barn) to the south ; Muidhe-Bhlarie (the
churn of the plains) to the south-west; and the Hill of Struie
(probably from Struidh, wasting or unproductive, which is just the
character of the soil to the west.  The first of these, which is
about 600 feet above the level of the sea, and the last, upwards of
1000 feet, are within this parish; and the other two, the former
of which is about the height of Struie, and the latter nearly 300
feet higher, are, " as wind and water fall," boundaries betwixt
this and the neighbouring parishes.  Between these bills there are,
together with the frith, six passes; by two of them, towards the
sea, is the Parliamentary road from Bonar Bridge to Tain; by
other two, below Muidbe-Bhlairie, the road from Bonar Bridge to
Dingwall passes; the remaining two, Lairg (lorg, a footpath,) and
Strath-rory, (Strath-ruaridh or uaradh, Strath of Roderick or Fox,
or rather of Water-Spouts,) have no roads, though the public ad-
vantage of a road in both, and especially in the former, has been
much felt, and generally admitted.  A committee of the road-
trustees of Easter-Ross inspected the ground two years ago, and
the principal hinderance in carrying this public and important im-
provement into effect is some difference of opinion about the ex-
act line which ought to be adopted,-a difference which no doubt
the, intelligent individuals concerned will ere long judiciously ad-
just for the public good.  The lower ledge runs along the whole
length of the parish, including the shore of the Cambuscurry bay
eastward, and the Fearns (Fearna, the alder-tree,) beyond Struie,
to tbe boundary towards Kincardine, westward, and bears evident
marks, from the character of the soil and other circumstances, of
having been at one period, though, perhaps, a very remote one,
under the sea; accordingly the lower parts are rich alluvial soil,
excepting near the shore, where it becomes sandy.  The second
ledge, especially on the higher side, is shallow and gravelly; but
when properly cultivated it yields in average seasons sure and
remunerating returns.  Within this range there are hundreds of
