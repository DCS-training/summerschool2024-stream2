the number gained in this manner is not equal to the num-
ber lost by the razing of houses.  The amount of the present
population is 621, comprehending all ages; males 325;
females 296.  There is no town in the parish, only 1 vil-
lage, containing 78.  The number of births for 10 years
preceding April 1790, was 165, making 16 1/2 yearly.  There
is no register of deaths kept here.  Since 1783, on account
of the tax, there has been a register of burials, which con-
tains all that have been buried here, whether parishioners
or strangers.  This would have given certain information
of the deaths in the parish, had it not been customary here
not to consine the burying of their dead to the church-
yard of the parish.  From October 1783 to October 1790,
there have been 28 marriages.  But this article may rea-
dily occasion a mistake, arid a return of many more mar-
riages may possibly be given than have actually taken place
in it.  When the bridegroom resides in one parish, and the
bride in another, there may be a report of the same mar-
riage from both these parishes.

The oldest inhabitant at present is a woman in her 90th
year, and 2 men going 85.  I recollect no tradition of re-
markable old age here.  Exclusive of pendicle tacksmen,
who depend not on farming alone for their subsistence, we
have 16 farmers, besides 2 gentlemen who farm part of
their own estates.  Their families in all contain 167 per-
sons.  There are 3 farms, on which the possessors do not
