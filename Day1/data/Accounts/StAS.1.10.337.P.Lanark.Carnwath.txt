Lockhart family and others of the heritors.  The collections
in the church amount annually to 25 L.; the mortcloths, etc.
to about as much more.  The number of families on the ses-
sion list, is, on an average, 30; these have quarterly allow-
ances made them, besides interim disbursements, as the cir-
cumstances of individuals require.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Both church and manse are in very bad
condition, and both ought to be rebuilt, as they are too bad
to admit of repair.  The church is an antient fabric.  The
aile, which has successively been the burying place of the
Somerville family, of the Dalziels Earls of Carnwath, and
now of Count Lockhart of Lee, was built in 1424, and is a
Gothic structure, covered with free stone flags.  There is
no record existing to give information when the body of the
church was erected; but from the difference of architecture
it appears to have been built at different times.  It is 100 feet
within the walls in length, and 20 in breadth, which renders
it very inconvenient as a place of worship.  The church of
Carnwath was founded in 1424 by Sir Thomas Somerville of
Carnwath, for a provost and 6 prebendaries.  There was at
the same time, and by the same person, provision made for
the maintenance of 8 poor old men.  Count Lockhart of Lee
is patron.  The stipend, by a late decree of augmentation, is
29 L. in money, and 4 chalders of meal.  The glebe consists
of 9 acres and one rood.  The manse was built in 1749; but,
from its present wretched condition, it appears to have been
badly executed at first*.

*No diseases are peculiar to this parish.  The general com-
plaint is rheumatism, occasioned by the damp houses, the earthen
floors, and perhaps by the close beds, which prevent a free cir-
culation of fresh air, which is doubtless necessary for the preser-
vation of health.  Most part of the parishioners, particularly
