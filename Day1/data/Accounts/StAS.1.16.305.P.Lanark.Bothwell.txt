     of Bothwell.

   The incumbent has expended considerably upon the
manse and garden, and has lately planted an orchard of a
choice collection of fruit-trees, which he hopes will yield
a benefit to his successors of L. 30 annually.
   It is to be wished that some general plan was adopted, to
put and keep manses and glebes in proper order.  Intrants
often find all in ruins.  Composed of the most superficial
materials, and given to the lowest undertaker, they need
patching every 12 years; whereas, if manses were made
good and substantial at first, they might last with little
charge for 80 or 100 years, and would be a great saving to
the landed interest.
   A house of the Relief persuasion was built in the year
1763.  The congregation is supplied from this, and five
neighbouring pamshes.
   The school does not accord with the respectability of
the parish, which has long suffered for want of a sufficient
schoolmaster.  It has checked the genius and improvements
of the people.  Complaints were numerous.  The salary* 
is co merks Scots, or L. 5: 1: 1 4/12.   No addition was
asked, but that the best use should be made of it.  When
a vacancy lately took place, the principal heritors required,
that an advertisement should be published; a comparative
trial of candidates taken; and the best qualified preferred;
that so the parish might be furnished with a man properly
accomplished for that important trust.  But this most equi-
table measure was defeated.  A party of portioners, and
other heritors, elected one, to whose qualifications strong
objections were offered.  The cause has undergone a tedi-
ous process, and is yet depending.
