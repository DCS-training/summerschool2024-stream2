     NUMBER XXXII.

     PARISH OF OCHILTREE,

     (COUNTY OF AYR.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM THOMSON.

     Extent, Situation, etc.

   THE parish of Ochiltree is situated in the presbytery of
Ayr, and in that district of the county of Ayr, de-
nominated Kyle.  The church and village of Ochiltree lie
about 11 miles eastward from the town of Ayr, on the
south side of the river Luggar, and on the road that leads
from that town to Dumfries.  The extent of the parish is
about six miles from north to south, and about five miles
from east to west.  The parish of Stair was formerly in-
cluded in that of Ochiltree, and many of the lands of Stair
still continue to pay stipend to the minister of Ochiltree;
but they were disjoined about 300 years ago.
