kirk-session supplies 5 L. from the mort-cloth money, etc.
From anno 1782-83, by reason of the great dearth at that
time, it was railed to 30 L. for the half year.  After this,
it was again reduced to 24 L. per half years at which it still
continues.  The number of poor on the roll is between 25
and 30, besides occasional allowances.

   Manufactures.-Anno 1778, Robert Boyd clothier came

clothing way.  The manufacture has increased; and this last
year he has made and carried to market, on his own behoof,
cloth to the value of 180 L. Sterlings besides country work.
As Stow is situated in an wool country, having plenty of
water, near to coals, and the Edinburgh markets it is to be
hoped the trade will succeed.  Before this periods the only
manufacture was what is called Stow struntain, made of the
coarsest wool, and wrought by the women on a loom like a
bed-heck.  Price of working one gross, or 144 yards, per
day, with meat, 6 d.; without meat, 9 d.  This is used for
garters and bindings, and sold at from 9 s. to 11 s. per gross.
