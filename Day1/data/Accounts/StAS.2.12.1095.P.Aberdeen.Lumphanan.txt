	Since the account of this parish was printed, the writer has dis-
covered some interesting notices respecting the Peel Bog. In 1657,
Patrick Irvine obtained from Oliver, Lord Protector, a precept
under the Great Seal respecting the lands of Craigtown of Lum-
phanan, Halton Peill, and Colliescroft. In 1702, Robert Ross
granted a disposition in favour of Francis Ross, of the lands of
Auchlossan, Cairbady, Bogloch, Aldcairn, Craigtown of Lum-
phanan, the Peill thereof, called Halton of Lumphanan, Collie's
Croft, Wester Kineardine, Dean's Cotts, and Haughhead.-(Char-
ters in possession of John Farquharson, Esq. of Finzean.)  Among
the estates which were entailed in 1790 by the trustees of Fran-
cis Farquharson, Esq. of Finzean were included "All and haill
the lands of Halton, with the Peill and manour-place thereof,
houses, biggings, yards and orchards of the said lands of Halton."
-(Appellant's Case, page 4, in the suit respecting the validity of
the Finzean entail, now before the House of Lords.) It is obvi-
ous that these notices afford a strong confirmation of the opinions
expressed in the article respecting the Peel Bog.
