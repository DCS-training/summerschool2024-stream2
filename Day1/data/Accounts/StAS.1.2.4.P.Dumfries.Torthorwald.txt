uphold them.  No houses are unoccupied.  The land in ge-
neral is better calculated for grain than pasture.  A good deal
of clover and rye grass is raised; but the mode of cultivation hi-
therto used, is rather of the old than of the new and most ap-
proved kind.  Formerly the farmers were accustomed to pay their
rents by their big or bear crops, and by selling peats in Dumfries;
but, for 20 years past, they have in a great measure given up
the sale of peats; and of late have taken to sowing barley
instead of bear.  Oats and barley are their chief grains; they
raise but little wheat, pease, rye, and scarcely any turnips.  A
large quantity of potatoes is annually raised, and this is the on-
ly article by which the grounds are cleaned, fallow being very
seldom practised.  Till about 1770 the farmers of Torthor-
wald and Roucan had a considerable part of their late.  Duke
of Queensberry removed no less than 25 farmers from these
villages to the more remote parts of the parish, where good farm
houses were erected; for which, his Grace gave them consi-
derable assistance, and at the same time inclosed almost his
whole grounds with stone dikes and thorn hedges, at the ex-
pence of above L. 2000.  The thorns have generally succeeded,
but the stone of which the dikes were built, being of the flatey
kind, they have fallen down very much.-The late Sir Wil-
liam Grierson, of Lag, was so attentive to have his lands clear
of weeds, that he held gool (chrysnthemum) courts as long as
he lived, for the purpose of fining the farmers, on whose
growing crop three heads or upwards of that weed were found.

   Implements of Husbandry, and Manures.-About 1750, there
were very few carts in the parish, trail cars being then gene-
rally used for leading goods; dung was carried out in creels;
may led in trusses; and peats in large sacks, upon horses backs;
but for a considerable time past, carts have been used for all these
