   Mills.-There are two corn mills, which do the most of
the work in the parish.  There are two lint mills, which are
insufficient to perform the work that would come to them.

   Swine.-Swine are become a considerable article of
commerce in this country, of late years.  Every body,
even the cottars, feed swine; many of the farmers 5 or 6, or
more in the year.  When fat, they are sold at between 3 L.
10 s. and 4 L. Sterling per head, or 3 1/4 d. per pound, as un-
cured pork; when salted and dried, they sell at 6 d. per
pound.  There are people who make a trade of salting and
curing it.  It is mostly sold into England; some little to E-
dinburgh.  It is a ready money traffic, and brings a deal of
cash into the country.  There may be 1000 L. worth sold in
this parish annually, besides what is consumed by the inha-
bitants.  It is affirmed by some, who are conversant in that
business, that from Nith to Sark and Eskfoot, on the border
of England, an extent of country of about 30 miles the
longest way, and about 16 the shortest, there is above
20,000 L. brought in annually for swine.  They do not breed
many in this parish.  The young ones are mostly brought
from England.

   Salmon Fishing.-There is a fine salmon fishing on the
Annan, which belongs mostly to the parish of Lochmaben.
In wet seasons the fish are very rich and plentiful.  They are
sold, in their season, commonly at 3 d. per pound.
