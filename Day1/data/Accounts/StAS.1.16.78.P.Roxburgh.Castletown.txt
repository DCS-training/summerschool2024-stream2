proper accommodation.  The wretched hovels in the
neighbourhood being continually damp and wet.  On the
farm of Dinlabyre, another spring of the same kind is
found; the collection of water is much greater, but at pre-
sent almost lost in the bog in which it is placed.  A third
is on the farm of Shortbuttrees, of excellent quality; all
these might be highly beneficial, if the ground were pro-
perly drained and attended to.  A very strong mineral spring
is found at Lawstown; but as its water has not been anali-
zed, it is uncertain to what class it belongs.

   Petrifying Water.-There are several springs of this
kind.  One is found on the Tweeden, exceedingly power-
ful, and containing a great quantity of water, where large
masses of petrified matter appear on every side converted
into solid stone.  The progress of the petrifaction is distinct
and beautiful.  The fog, which grows on the edge of the
springs, and is sprinkled with the water, is about eight
inches high; the lower part is converted into solid stone;
the middle appears as if half frozen, and the top is green
and flourishing.  The petrified matter, when burnt, is re-
solved into very fine lime.  The spring itself, when led
over the fields in little rills, fertilizes them exceedingly.

   Cascades.-There are several beautiful water-falls on the
river Tweeden, the little streams of Dinlabyre, Har-
den, and Sundhope.  But on the river Blackburn, such
scenes are seen in all their beauty and variety.  Some-
times the river shoots over a perpendicular rock, in one
unbroken sheet of water, forming a beautiful cascade; at
other times it is darted over tremendous precipices, and
rages furiously among the huge masses of the rock below.
In this wild and romantic vale, nature appears in various
