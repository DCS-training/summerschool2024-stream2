	highest ridges and more rocky eminences of the different town-
	ships.  The industry with which the trenching and improving of
	hitherto waste land is carried on by these small tenants, is easily ac-
	counted for, when it is stated, that no advance of rent follows in con-
	sequence of any improvement or progressiveamelioration of the soil;
	that the whole benefits resulting from those causes have been enjoy-
	ed exclusively by the tenants, and that the rents have been placed on
	such a reasonable scale, that there was not a single sixpence of the
	rents of the whole parish left unpaid on last audit day; and that such
	a proceeding as a distraint for rent has not been known among these
	tenants, for a long period of years.  In addition to these mighty
	advantages, the whole allotments of the small tenants are very ju-
	diciously intersected by branch roads, along which the important
	article of fuel,-peats of excellent quality,-are readily carted home
	from the neighbouring hill mosses, and the necessary removal of
	manure and other field operations are effected with great facility.
	   Fisheries.-The most important fisheries belonging to the pa-
	rish, are those of salmon in the river Helmsdale, and the herring-
	fishery at the village of Helmsdale.  The former has been cele-
	brated from the oldest period of which we have record, as produc-
	tive and valuable. For several years past, the river has been fish-
	ed directly by the servants of the proprietor, who, avoiding all
	close and severe fishing, and taking every means to protect the
	spawning fish when ascending the river, and the fry afterwards,
	besides closing the fishing season, at least two weeks before the
	time fixed by law, (and which is also done in all the other rivers
	on the estates of Sutherland,) thus guard, by all available means,
	this fine salmon stream from the evils of too close and exterminat-
	ing a system of fishing, so often complained of, when tenants oc-
	cupy such fishings.  The fish are disposed of by contract, at a
	certain price per pound and are sent off in a fresh state in ice to
	the London market.
	   Herring-Fishery.-This very important branch of industry has
	been conducted with such spirit, and such signal and increasing
	success, since it was established and prosecuted, on a regular sys-
	tem at Helmsdale, that its history and present condition claim
	particular notice in any account of the parish of Loth.  The un-
	settled state of the north of Scotland before the suppression of the
	Rebellion in 1746, may alone be adduced as a sufficient reason for
	the neglect, down to that period, of the fisheries which now add
	so materially to the prosperity and well-being of the population of
