   These facts tend to prove, that tillage, in those early
periods, was attended to, and indeed considerably advan-
ced.  It was probably in an improving state, until the ac-
cession of James VI. to the throne.  During his minority,
and thence to the year 1620, Scotland in general, and the
northern parts of it in particular, were torn by factions, and
laid waste by rapine and bloodshed, more than any other
country in Europe.  When beginning to recover, the ci-
vil wars in the reign of the unfortunate Charles I. the
persecutions under Charles II. and the famine in the reign
of King William, materially affected the industry of the
people; so that the nation did not breathe, in peace and

last 30 years, their industry has become active, and, in ge-

   The present practice of farming, and succession of crops,
varies, according to the nature of the soil, and the genius of
the farmer.  Three plowings are generally given to a field
for bear; one after harvest, another in March, and a third
in May, with the manure.  The succeeding crop is oats,
with grass seeds, or pease, and next year it is dressed for bear,
with sprinkling of dung.  Others, sallow, or have turnips
or patatoes, which is followed by oats or bear, sowed down
with grass seeds.  In very light soils, rye is sown after
bear to great advantage, and the next crop is bear with
manure and grass seeds.  Sometimes old leys are broken
up in August, and after another plowing in spring, the
crop is oats, and the succeeding season bear, after three
plowings and dung.
   This is the general rotation of crops.  Fallows are daily
becoming more universal, as are turnips, which several
