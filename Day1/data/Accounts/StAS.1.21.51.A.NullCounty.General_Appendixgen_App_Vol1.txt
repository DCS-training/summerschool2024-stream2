masters who collect it.  1 mo. The act contains no clause oblig-
ing registers to be kept; and of consequence, where the school-
master has no dues for registration himself, in all such cases
he keeps no register at all; this is the case as to burials
and marriages.  The schoolmaster has a fee for registering
births and baptisms; he therefore keeps that register.  He
has a fee also for granting an extract of proclamation of
banns; he therefore keeps a register of proclamations: but
a proclamation is not a marriage, and the act extends only to
registers of marriages.  The schoolmaster is indeed authoris-
ed by the act to compel the parishioners to registrate births,
burials and marriages, under penalty of a heavy fine; but as
he has no interest to volunteer himself in collecting taxes
where he has no fee for registrating, he does not use his
power.  For, 2 do, the allowance from government to school-
master for collecting is so trisling, that in the bulk of coun-

ed to take out a licence from the stamp-office, authorising
him to keep a register, which costs him a crown.  He is also
obliged, so often as required by the collector of the stamp-
duties, to post away to the county town where the office is
kept, at the distance sometimes of 20 miles, to account to
the collector for the duties he has raised, while his whole
emoluments are only an allowance of 2 s. in the pound upon
what he has collected.
   Supposing the act peremptorily enforced the keeping of
registers, so that the poor schoolmaster could demand all the
duties, without subjecting himself to the odium of volunteer-
ing himself in the business, the average of threepences col-
lected on all, would not perhaps exceed 10 s. or 12 s. yearly
in the generality of country parishes; of course the whole al-
lowance to the schoolmaster for his original advance for his
