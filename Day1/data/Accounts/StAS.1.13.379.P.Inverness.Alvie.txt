     of Alvie.

The non-residence of the proprietors is exceedingly against
its improvement in many respects.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The inferior tenants are
very poor, owing to their small holdings, and their habi-
tations wretched; they pay from L. 2 to L. 6 rent, which
may be from 5 s. to 10 s. the acre arable, affording a scanty
subsistence to a family, which affects their morals, so that
their veracity or honesty is not always to be depended on.
They have no idea of trade or manufactures, and conse-
quently no desire to leave their native land; they prefer
living on the smallest pendicle of land as tenants to the best
service, and are extremely averse to the military.  They
procure their little necessaries from the market-towns, by
the sale of small parcels of wood they bring thither (distant
40 miles).  They are very ignorant of the principles of
religion, as but few of them can read.  There is no Diffen-
ter of any description in the parish.  There is but one place
of worship, and that in the extremity of the parish.  The
incumbent frequently preaches in the kirk of Inch, as being
more contiguous to the greater part of the parishioners than
the parish-church.  The climate is dry and healthy, and
there is less of storm than what is at a few miles distance on
either hand, probably owing to its being equidistant from the
E and W. seas.  The natives live to a good old age; there
are severals are present beyond 80 years.  The last minister
died at 101, and preached till within six months of his
death.  The principal diseases are fevers, rheumatisms, and
consumptions.  The prejudice against inoculation is hap-
pily removed, so that very few die now of that naufeous
disorder, the small-pox.

   Rent, Population, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 1394 Scots, the real rent about L. 800 Sterling, besides
