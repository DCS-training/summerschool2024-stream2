too apt to corrupt one other; and, when assembled in such

Christianity, which, even among the lowest of the people,
was less the characteristic of this country, than any of the
neighbouring kingsdoms, will soon become prevalent; and,
if one ignorant race once arise, it is probable that not only
the next, but many succeeding ones, of the same description,
will follow*.  The children, too, in these works, confined,
as it were, to the very point of a spindle, must of course have
narrows ideas and contracted minds.  The siner parts of the
cotton, also, in the progress of the work, flying off continual-

teach them some part of the day.  The first has been disregarded,
the latter only partially observed.
