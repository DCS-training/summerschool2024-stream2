     PRICE OF WAGES AND PRODUCE.

   The price of butchers meat, and other articles of provi-
sion, may be reckoned at the same rates here as in Dun-
keld, it being the only market for them to which the pa-
rishioners can go.  Of grain, the prices per boll are, for
barley, 15 s.; for oats and for pease, 14 s.; for meal, 15 s.
Wool is sold at different rates, from 6 s. to L. 1 per stone;
peats at 1 s. 3 d. per cart.  Of wages, the rate is for a man-
servant from L. 8 to L. 10 per annum; and of a woman,
from L. 3 to L. 4; of a mason, 1 s. 6 d. a-day; of a tailor,
6 d. with his meat; of a man during harvest, 1 s.; and of a
woman at that time, 6 d. both with their meat.

     PROGRESS OF MANNERS, etc.

   In 1778, there were not 4 houses in the parish where tea
was used; now, (in 1798) it is used in every house.
Then, there was not a hat worn by any of the tenants, or
their servants; now, there are many.  Then, there was not
one black cap; now, all the women wear them.  Then,
the gowns of the women were camblet, and their aprons
woollen; now, the gowns are of printed linen, and the
aprons of whitt muslin.  Then, many of the men wore the
philibeg; now, there are none who do so.  Then, all of
them had tartan hose; now, all have stockings.  Then, in
short, the whole articles of the dress of the people were
home-made, excepting their bonnets, and a few shoes; now,
they are all bought from the merchants of Dunkeld.

     GENERAL REMARKS.

   It may be thought that the size of the farms in this pa-
rish might be enlarged with advantage to the proprietor;
for that fewer, both of men and horses than are at present
employed, would be equal to the cultivation of the soil, and
