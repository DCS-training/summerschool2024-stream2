     Statistical Account

   It is to be observed, on the above enumeration, that it must
be rather under, than above, the real amount.  In some of
the parishes, lodgers were not included; and in all of them,
the real number of many families could not be obtained, in
consequence of the absurd apprehensions entertained, that the
enumeration was intended for the purpose of laying on some
new tax, in which the people were to be charged higher in
proportion to the number of their children.  It is probable that
from 2 to perhaps 3000 fouls more would have appeared on
the lifts, had the enumeration been more accurate and com-
plete, and had there been no concealment in consequence of
the above mentioned prejudices of several of the inhabitants.
   There appears, however, at any rate, to have been a very
great additional increase indeed to the popution of the ca-
pital of Scotland and its environs, the progress of which may
be slated as follows:
