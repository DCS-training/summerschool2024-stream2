   Miscellaneous Observations.-Drochil Castle, at the conflu-
ence of the Terth with the Lyne, was built by Morton,
Regent of Scotland.  He was beheaded before it was finished.

   In some parts of this parish the lands are thirled to mills,
to the extent of the sixteenth of all the oats raised; horse
corn, and the seed sown on the farm, only excepted.  So
heavy a thirlage leads the farmer sometimes to sow other
grain, when, if it were not for the thirlage, oats would be
the more profitable crop.
