     of Banff.

near the mount.  In the same ground, on and eminence,
overhanging the river, his Lordship has built an elegant
mausoleum.  It is of Gothic architecture, surrounded with
shrubbery,

     "The cypress and the yew's funereal shade,"

and forms a striking ornament to the park.  The windows
are of painted glass, in casements of stone, and in front are
placed two beautiful figures in statuary, emblematical of
Faith and Hope.
   Among the monuments in the mausoleum, is one of cu-
rious sculpture, and great antiquity, sacred to the memory
of John Duff of Maldavat, an ancestor of Lord Fife.  it was
brought hither a few years ago, together with the ashes of
the deceased, from the family burying-place, in the aisle
of Cullen.  In this monument is rudely sculptured the fi-
gure of a warrior in full coat of armour, with this inscrip-
tion, "Hic jacet Johanes Duf. de Maldavat. et Baldavi.
"obiit a Julii. 1404," etc*.
   The monument of greatest antiquity in the church,
seems to be that in Lord Banff's aisle, with the following
inscription:

     Ano Dni 1558.29 Nove
     Obiit. Valterus. Ogilvy. de. Dvnlvgvs. Miles.
     Prepofit.Huj. Urbis, etc+.
