   Poor.-The number of the poor of this parish is, at an ave-
rage, two.  The annual amount of the contributions for their
relief is about L. 15: 16: 8 Sterling.  The number relieved
at present is from two to four.  The elders of the kirk-
session, in the different parts of the parish, give information
concerning the state of the poor.  In 1782, the kirk-session
purchased a small quantity of corn made it into meal, and
divided it among poor families.
