with different sort of pines; as Scoth,black and white,
American spruce.  Weymouth, silver, and balm of Gilead.
He has also reared nursery, consisting of acres of ground;
which, contains more than a million of plants, all in a most
thriving condition, and soon to be transplanted for cherishing
and beautifying various other fields.

   Fruit trees.-His lordship has likewise laid out an exten-
sive orchard of fruit trees, for the purpose of establishing a small orchard at every farn house.  A few years ago, there

was not a single fruit tree to be seen in any part of the parish,
except what grew about St. Mary's isle.  Some vestiges of
old orchards, scattered up and down, are still to be traced,
but neither trees nor fruit are any where to be found.
must have gone into decay near century ago.  A great
indigenous plants are to be found, along the shore, and in
the environs of Kirkcudbright, and especially around St.
Mary's Isle, which would afford much entertainment for the
curious botanist; but as they are all so well described by the
Rev. JOHN LIGHTFOOT, in his Flora Scotica, a repetition of
them is unnecessary.  In his Lordship garden, at St. Mary's
Isle, there are 6 hot houses, besides forcing frames, all upon
a new construction, which contain various sorts of fruits and
exotics.  Fruit trees, laid horizontally upon a bank, in place
of a wall, have lately been tried by his Lordships gardener,
and have answered remarkably well.  In short, from the va-
rious improvements already made, and still carrying on, the
face of this country will, in the course of a few years, be totally
changed.  It will assume a most beautiful appearance.  The
most charming landscapes will strike the eye, and afford de-
lightful subjects for the poet's fancy, and the painters pencil.
