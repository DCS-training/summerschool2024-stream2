when the vegetation is very rapid, and both corn and grass
flourish much, till they are checked in the month of August,
which too often blasts the hopes of the husbandman.  A-
bout that season the winds generally blow with such fury
from the west and south-west, that the sea by dashing against;
the rocks, which on that side of the country are high,
steep, and rugged, spreads a shower or spray of salt water
over almost the whole islands.  By means of this spray, the
grass which before looked green and healthy, and the fields

which were originally derived from Norway.  The instru-
ments they have for the purpose of weighing, are a kind of

of making, and mending, and adjusting these instruments, the
smallest defect in which must, it is evident, render them very
false; and even when they are as perfect as their nature will
admit of, by a sort of flight of hand trick perfectly easy, and
perfectly well known to those who weigh, great injustice may
be done, without almost the possibility of detection.  Many in-
