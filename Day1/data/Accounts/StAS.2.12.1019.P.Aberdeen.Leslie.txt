		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, &c.--TRADITION gives the origin of the name to the
settlement of the Leslyns or Leslys in this district, which took
place so early as the eleventh century.
	Boundaries, &c.--The parish is bounded on the south by the
parishes of Keig and Tullynessle, from which it is divided by a
ridge of hills, which form part of a range beginning with Benochie
on the east, and, terminating at Cabrach on the west, divide the
Garioch from the Alford districts; on the west and north, by
Clatt and Kennethmont; and on the east, by Insch and Prem-
nay. Its greatest length is about 3 1/2 miles, and breadth about 2 1/2
miles.
	An elevated ground, rising in some parts into hills, and running
from east to west, divides it into two nearly equal parts. Between
this ridge and the hills which divide the parish from the Alford
district, lies a valley in which runs the Gady. Skirting the base
of this central ridge on the west, north, and east, lies the remain-
der of the lands of the parish.
	The climate is rather moist, and very variable. In the valley
mentioned, it is warmer than in the north-west part of the parish,
which is exposed to the north winds, and in the vicinity of a
moss.
