" justly, and according to law."  Murdac, his lady, and
two sons, are intombed in their family burying place, in a
small island of the Loch of Monteith, which lies near the
Kirk of Port.
   During these lamentable transactions the Castle of Doune,
as well as Falkland in Fife, were seized by the King, and
remained annexed to the Crown till the year 1502, when
Margaret, the daughter of Henry VII. King of England,
was married to James IV. King of Scotland, and got settled
on her, in liferent, the Castle of Doune, and certain lands in
Monteith.  After the death of James IV. she married Hen-
ry Lord Methven, a descendant of Murdac Duke of Alba-
ny.  This marriage took place in the year 1528; and im-
mediately thereafter the Queen, with consent of her son
King James V. and of her husband Lord Methven, granted
to James Stewart, a younger brother of her husband Lord
Methven, and ancestor of the family of Moray, the custody
of the Castle of Doune for his life; and which right was a
few years afterwards converted into a feu to him and his
heirs by King James V.  This office had been enjoyed by
the family of Edmonstone of Duntreath, and occasioned a
deadly quarrel betwixt the families, which ended in the as-
sassination of the above James Stewart by Edmonstone of
Duntreath.  But James, the son of the above James Stew-
art, obtained full possession of the castle, and was afterwards
created Lord Doune, by charter anno 1581.  Since this pe-
riod, the castle has remained in the possession of the Earl
of Moray's family without interruption.

   Agriculture.-The variety of soil in this parish opens a
very wide field for agricultural study.  There is scarcely a
single farm but has change of soil in it, and hence, by
skill and industry, can be rendered fit for almost every
crop.
