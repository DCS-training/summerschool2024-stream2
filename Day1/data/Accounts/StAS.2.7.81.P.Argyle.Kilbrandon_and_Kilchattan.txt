is 108. A few more receive occasional aid. Those on the roll
have received, for some years past, from 1Os. to L.1, 5s. each in
the year, according to their necessities. The church collections,
with other dues, amount to about L.20 a year. The Marquis of
Breadalbane gives very liberal donations, which enable the
kirk-session to give the sums above-mentioned to the poor.
His Lordship also allows small pensions to some aged and reduced
tenants. The superannuated quarriers are chiefly supported by a
fund of their own, arising from a nominal rent of 5s. annually paid
for their houses and gardens. The Easdale Slate Company give
a monthly allowance of meal to disabled quarriers and their fami-
lies.
  Savings Bank.-Under the patronage of Lord Breadalbane, a
Savings bank was established at Easdale, two years ago; but it is
now merged in the National Security Savings' Bank at Oban. It
is hoped, when its advantages are better understood, that the
class of people for whose benefit it has been established, will avail
themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them of making some
revision for the time of sickness and old age.
  Fuel-The quarriers at Easdale are all supplied with coals
from Glasgow at the rate of 13s. per ton. The farmers generally
use peats, which were, at one time, very plentiful in these island,
and easily secured ; but are now becoming rather scarce, particu-
larly in the island of Seil.
