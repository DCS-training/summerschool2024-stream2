   Charitable Societies.-There are three charitable societies
in Beith; two of those commenced in 1772.  One of them
has 220 L. of stock and the other 370 L.  The third com-

in purchasing grain and meal for the use of the inhabitants.
The meal was sold to the inhabitants in general, at the market
price; but to the members of the societies, and to the poor

office, who received a small allowance for their trouble.  From
the 28th of October 1782, to the 14th of September 1683,
above 1000 bolls were sold in this manner.  As the object
was to secure plenty, a premium of 6 d. per boll was given
for 230 bolls of the above quantity, which had the desired ef-

   Since charitable societies are evidently of great utility to
the poor, it is a pity they should labour under any disadvan-
tages, tending to check the ardour of that benevolence, to
which they owe their existence.  They certainly deserve
every encouragement from the friends of mankind, and are
