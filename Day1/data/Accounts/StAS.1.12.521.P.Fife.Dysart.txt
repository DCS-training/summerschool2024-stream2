     Of Dysart.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The first advantage is,
plenty of coal; but posterity will not thank us for wasting it
so fast by exportation.  2 d, Its vicinity to the sea, convenient
for commerce and fishing.  Little attention is paid to the last.
We have only one family of fishers.  The town is supplied
with fish from Wemyss parish.  They are carried on women's
backs.  The fish caught here, are, cod, whiting flounder,
mackerel, baggety, sand-eel, crabs, and lobsters.  The lobsters
are sent to Edinburgh.  3 d, A good public road through the
parish.  So much cannot be said for the cross roads, which
are next to impassable.  When the public roads are finished,
it is to be hoped attention will be paid to them.  Tolls have
been erected in the neighbourhood, and one in the parish,
not without grumbling.  It is generally thought they were
necessary; and few will grudge to pay them, when the roads
are well made.  The chief disadvantage is, a scarcity of good
water, particularly in the town of Dysart; the surface is
much drained by the working of the coal.

   Improvements suggested.-It would be of great import-
ance to the trade of the place, to have the harbour deepened,
and rendered more secure.  The town can do very little in
this way from their own funds; but as upwards of 3000 L.
are annually paid to Government from goods exported and
imported at this harbour, and a great value of shipping is
there annually exposed to danger, they think they have a
claim for some aid from Government, for carrying on so neces-
sary and so useful a work.  2. A dry dock might be easily
made in the W. side of the harbour.  The stones are daily
quarried for building: at some additional expense, they might
be so quarried as to form a dock in the solid rock.  3. Ground
might be gained from the sea, near the harbour, which is
much wanted to contain the wood used in ship-building.  Some
