3000.  Being equi-distant from Edinburgh and Morpeth, the
fat beasts are some years divided almost equally between these
markets.  Some enclosed their sheep, in the summer nights,
with moveable fences, which are occasionally removed, and
the place lately occupied is directly ploughed, to preserve the
manure in its strength.  Much of the sheep pasture has been
ploughed, and laid down with sown grass and lime.  Thirty
ploughs, with two horses each, perform the agricultural work
of this parish.

   Population.-It is often mentioned with regret that there
is a considerable decrease of his Majesty's subjects in this pa-
rish; 40 years ago it consisted of 27 farmers, the patron, and
minister; now there are only 12, three of whom, with the
patron, do not reside.  Of the residing farmers, only three
are married.  The number of houses is reduced to 55, con-
taining 283 persons above eight years old; and about 100
children besides, so that the number is supposed to be greatly
diminished.  In Dr Webster's report, however, the popula-
tion is stated at only 413 souls; the decrease upon the whole,
therefore, is not above 16.  There have been four marriages,
ten births, and six burials, annually, upon an average, for
these nine years past.  Three young men inlisted into the
Train of Artillery last year.  More than one third of the peo-
are Seceders.  There are no other sectaries in the parish.

   Poor.-The following authentic extracts from the sede-
runts of heritors meetings, for the last 47 years, will show
the state of the poor.  The assessment only of every 5th or
6th year since the commencement in 1744 is here stated, al-
though the charge and number of poor at every meeting is
regularly inserted in the records.
