or effected by the wantonness of strangers. There are a number of
other caves beside it, some of them of equal magnitude, though
of less interest. One of them is called the King's Kitchen; ano-
ther his cellar; a third his stable, &c. The cascades we have
noticed elsewhere.

         Parochial Registers.-There are separ`te registers for session,
baptisms and marriages, kept at Kilmorie, Shisken, and Loch-
ranza. Those of Kilmorie are the earliest, the fullest, and the
most accurate. The others are kept for the convenience of the
inhabitants, at places, where, from the great extent of the parish,
and the distance of the parish church, places of worship have been
erected, and the ordinances are administered, either by the clergy-
man or his assistant. Those of Kilmorie commence in May 1701,
and are regularly, fully, and beautifully kept till May 1729. From
this date till 1762, they are lost, with the exception of the scroll
minutes of a few meetings of session in 1736-7, on loose leaves
stitched together, but almost illegible. From 1762 till the pre-
sent date, they are regularly and carefully, though not very taste-
fully kept. The two first volumes, which are by far the most in-
teresting, are quite loose in the binding; the edges much worn in,
and a good deal of the writing gone. The words that are lost could
still be supplied from the context, but, unless they are speedily
transcribed, from the decaying state of the paper, they will soon
be entirely destroyed.
	A grain-mill at Shedog, a distillery at Lag, and a liot and wool-
mill at Burican, are the only public works in the parish.

                           III.-POPULATION.
	We have no accessible means of ascertaining the state of the
population prior to 1791, though doubtless the rent-rolls would
furnish data for a pretty accurate approximation, as far back as
they extend.
                       In 1791, it amounted to 2830
                         1801,                 2996
                         1811,                 2420
                         1821,                 3827
                         1831,                 8771
of which number 1816 were males, and 1955 females.
