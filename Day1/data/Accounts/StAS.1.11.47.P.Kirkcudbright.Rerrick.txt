On turning round, you have lying before you the Frith, 10
leagues broad, extending, on the left hand, about 30 miles;
and, on the right, until it is lost in the Irish Sea.  On the
English coast, you have the towns of Alumby, Maryport,
Workington, Herrington, Parton, and Whitehaven, with the
intervening fields and hedges: All of which, except the last,
are distinctly seen by the naked eye.  On the back of these
appear the Cumberland mountains, towering one above ano-
ther; but all overtopped by the lofty Skidda; which, how-
ever, seems to have a competitor in Criffle, on the opposite
shore, in the neighbourhood of Dumfries.  These mountains
have the effect, as it were, of throwing the Frith into a shade,
by which every object is more distinctly perceived, and the
beauty of the whole greatly increased.  From the point of
St. Bee's to the Isle of Man, lying in the Irish sea, is an ex-
tent of 11 leagues; and from thence to the point of White-
horn, of about 9; the whole track forming a curve of about
90 miles; which, from several parts of the parish, the eye
can take in distinctly at once.  But what completes the gran-
deur of the scene, is, the variety of vessels that appear scattered
every where, often to the number of 40, 30, and 60.  And
as most of the Stations from whence it is seen, stand high, and
the view reaches to the mouth of St. George's Channel, and
towards the north of Ireland, (consequently very extensive),
the vessels, by a well known law in optics, seem elevated one
above another, according to their distance, till the farthest ap-
pear as if dropping out of the clouds: So that, in a certain
slate of the atmosphere, it looks like an immense canvas hung
down from heaven, with these vessels pictured upon it.

   Fish.-The tide in the Frith runs from E. to W. with con-
riderable rapidity.  Reasoning from analogy, and calculating
from appearances, it is generally concluded, that there are
