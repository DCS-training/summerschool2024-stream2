   Manufactures.-Though the situation of this parish appears
to be peculiarly favourable for manufactures, yet there is
little done in that way.  The only articles worth mentioning,
are, a tannery, a soap-work, and the making of candles, which
have justly acquired a high character.  Mr. Ruffin, too, erect-
ed a tambour manufacture here in February 1790.  He in-
dentured 110 girls as apprentices, from 9 to 12 years of age,
besides 4 boys.  He also erected, at the same time, a manu-
facture of the same kind at Musselburgh, and had 22 appren-
tices bound on the same day.  These apprentices are bound
for 4 years, and are paid as follows:-For the first year, they
have 2 s. a-week paid them every Saturday; for the second,
2 s. 6 d. a-week; and for the last 2 years, they have 3 s. week-
ly.  Mr. Ruffin was the first who introduced this branch of
manufacture into Scotland, in the year 1782, under the pa-
tronage of the Honourable Board of Trustees in Edinburgh,
from whom he received three different premiums, one of 40 L.,
one of 30 L., and one of 20 L., besides his house rent paid
him for three years.  This branch of business is now so much
increased, that it employs not fewer than 30,000 young girls
in Scotland.

   Heritors, Church, Manse, Stipend, Poor, School.-The num-
ber of heritors is 24.  The whole of the parish holds of the
Duke of Buccleugh, who is proprietor of about two-thirds of
it.  His Grace is also patron and titular of the teinds.  The
church, though old, is in good repair, and in winter is ren-
dered comfortable, by being warmed with stoves.  The manse,
which appears from an inscription over the door, to have
been built in the year 1681, is a large, lodgeable house, but
badly situated, and so gloomy as to resemble a prison, being
hemmed in with buildings on three sides, and deprived of the
benefits of sun-shine for nearly the whole winter half year.
