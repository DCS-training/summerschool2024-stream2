discover an inclination to abandon tillage, and throw their
lands into pasturage.  A married servant, with 3 or 4 chil-
dren, if he and his wife are sober and industrious, can live
more comfortably than many of the farmers.  Besides his
wages, he has ground from his master for planting as many
potatoes as he can gather manure fit to raise them.  Trades-
men, such as masons, wrights, taylors, etc. unless they work
by the piece, are allowed 18 d. a day, or 1 s. and their
maintenance.  Day labourers, employed in casting peats, re-
ceive 9 d. a man, and 6 d. a woman.

     Population.  The Population, of late years, if a conclusion
may be drawn from the births entered in the parish register,
has rather decreased.  By a survey lately taken, (in April
1791), the number of souls amounted to 1365; of whom
610 were males, and 755 females.  The return to Dr Web-
ster, in 1755, was 1520.  There appears to be, therefore, a
decrease, on the whole, of 155.  The births and marriages,
for the last 10 years, as recorded in the parish register, are as
follows:
