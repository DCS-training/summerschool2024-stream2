                 PARISH OF ECCLESMACHAN.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.

           THE REV. JOHN SMITH, MINISTER.


         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE name of this parish, so far back as can be traced,
has been written Ecclesmachan. It is usually pronounced Inch-
mahan, a custom, apparently, of considerable antiquity; for in a
list of parishes existing in 1581, and contained in "the Booke of
the Universal Kirk," it stands Inchmachame. Of this name, va-
rious Celtic etymologies have been proposed, but none of them
appear satisfactory. The most probable is that assigned in the
former Statistical Report, viz. Ecclesia Machani or, in Gaelic,
Eaglais Machan, "the Church of Machan." In Keith's Calen-
dar of Scots Saints is mentioned a St Machan, who, it is said,
died about the middle of the ninth century. What connection he
had with this part of the country, it is presumed, cannot now be
ascertained.
   Extent and Boundaries.-The parish is divided into two un-
equal portions, distant about one mile from each other, and se-
parated by an outlying district of Linlithgow parish. The west-
ern division is about 2 1/2 miles long, and 1 1/4 broad; the eastern
division is 1 3/4 miles long, by 1 1/2 broad; and the extreme points
are nearly 5 miles from each other. The extent in square miles
is 3.83, or 2458 imperial acres. The outline is very irregular.
It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Abercorn and Lin-
lithgow; on the west, by Bathgate; on the south, by Livingstone
and Uphall; and, on the east, by Kirkliston and Auldcathie, a
detached portion of Dalmeny parish.
   Topographical Appearances.-The two sections are each com-
posed of a ridge of land. That on the west is the higher, as-
cending, perhaps, to the height of 600 feet, intersected in several
places by shallow ravines, and sloping chiefly to the south. The
eastern ridge is lower, having on its southern edge a pretty steep
