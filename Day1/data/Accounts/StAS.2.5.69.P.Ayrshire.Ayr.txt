of property in the building. In the old church, the seats are all
let or nearly so, and in some parts belonging to incorporated
bodies, which have been lately repaired, there are more demands
for sittings than can be supplied. The attendance here is always
numerous and respectable. It was built in 1654, and the new
church in 1810. Both are capable of accommodating from 2000
to 2500 sitters, and there are about 1000 communicants or upwards
at each sacrament,--this ordinance being dispensed twice a-year.
There is no want of church accommodation at present in the pa-
rish, and a considerable number of sittings have been set apart for
the poor by the magistrates, some entirely qratis, and others at
such low rates as to make them easily accessible to the most indi-
gent.
	There is a meeting house in this parish, belonging to the Relief
body of Dissenters, another to the Moravians, and a third to the
Methodists; but the congregations of the two last are small, and
that of the Relief is made up of people from six or eight parishes.
There are various other Dissenters who have places of worship on
the other side of the river, and numbers belonging to them in the
parish of Ayr. The following tables, the result of a survey made in
1836, will exhibit in one distinct view, the population belonging to
the Established Church, and also to the Dissenting denominations,
