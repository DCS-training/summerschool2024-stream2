     Statistical Account

by some other gentlemen in the country.  Mr Snodgrass has
made the following alteration upon his own plan.  In any
of the leaves he has lately given to his tenants, he restricts
them to plough one-fourth for 2 years only, while the other
three-fourths remain in grass for 6.  This he looks upon as
an improvement upon his former plan, as 3 successive crops
of oats are considered to improverish a field very much, even
though it is in the highest order when at first broke up.
There is a considerable quantity of very fine cheese made in
the parish.  Some of the farmers keep from 12 to 22 milk
cows.  The average rent of lands in the parish will be from
a guinea to 22 s. the acre.  There are a few fields in it
rented so high as 42 s. and 43 s.
