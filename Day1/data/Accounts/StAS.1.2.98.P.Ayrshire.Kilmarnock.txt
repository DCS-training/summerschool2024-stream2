longer the heat of the sun, as in summer, to exhale them, lie
and stagnate on the surface of the ground, during the whole
winter; which greatly injures it, and, for a time, even destroys
its vegetative powers.  The bad effects of this circumstance,
however, are now not nearly so much, nor so generally felt
as formerly.  This, in a great measure, is owing to the num-
berless drains made by the ditches, which have been drawn,
in all directions, for inclosing in this fertile part of the
country, where stones are scarce, is by ditches, with haw-
thorn hedges planted in the sides, or on the top og the banks.
This method was little known, and still less practised, till a-
bout 35 or 40 years.  Before that period, no inclosure was to be
seen, except, perhaps, one or two about a gentleman's seat, in
all the wide, extended, and beautiful plain of Cunninghame.
Hence, at the end of harvest, when the crop was carried from the
fields into the barn-yard, the whole country had the appear-
ance of a wild and dreary common, and nothing was to be
seen, but here and there, a poor, bare, and homely hut,
where the farmer and his family were lodged.  The cattle too,
were then allowed to wander about at pleasure through all the
neighbouring fields, till the grass began to rise in the spring,
and miserably poached all the arable ground, now saturated
with the water that lay on the surface.  To such a degree
was this mischief done, by the ranging of the cattle in search
of food, when none was to be found, that, in many places,
it destroyed all prospect of any crop, worth the labour of the
husbandman, for the ensuing year; and, in some instances,
for many years to come.  But now the scene is completely al-
tered, and infinitely to the better.  There is, at this time,
scarcely a single farm, in all that wide-extended plain, that is
not inclosed with ditch and hedge, and most of them with
numbers of intermediate ones, to separate the fields from each
