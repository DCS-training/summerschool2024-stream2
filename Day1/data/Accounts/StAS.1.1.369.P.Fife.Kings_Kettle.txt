     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   KING'S KETTLE, formerly called Catul, or Katul, is
situated in the county of Fife; in the presbytery of
Cupar, and synod of Fife.  The origin of the name is uncer-
tain.  It is, however, proved by authentic records, that the
lands of Kettle were once the property of the crown, and
were afterwards fued in 8 divisions, in perpetual tacks, at the
rents then received; which are still paid to the King, under
the name of Crown Rents.  Kettle is bounded by Falkland
on the West; by Markinch, Kennoway, and Scoonie, on the
South; by Ceres, Cult, and Collessie, on the east; and by
Aughtermuchty on the north.  The parish contains some-

figure, narrowest towards the west; in length, from east to
west, nearly 8 miles; and in its greatest breadth a little more
than 2 miles.  The village of Kettle is situated in the flat of
the strath, rather low and wet, on the south side of the Eden;
the floods of which reach to the skirts of the village.  Bal-
malcolm is situated about a furlong south-east, at the foot of
the rising ground; and the road by Cupar, between the Forth
