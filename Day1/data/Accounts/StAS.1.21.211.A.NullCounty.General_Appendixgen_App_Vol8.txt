Such a situation deserves the notice of government.  There
are at present 14 small sloops belonging to it; but, for
want of a harbour, they are obliged to go elsewhere in win-
ter.  These sloops are employed in fishing and transport-
ins freestone, victual, etc. to different parts north and south.
-The Society for promoting Fisheries seem to have ne-
glected, or been ignorant of this place, else they would have
erected some of their villages here.-The property is Sir
Archibald Dunbar's, of Northfield, to whom the greatest
part of the parish also belongs.
   There are few different opinions here as to religious mat-
ters.  A meeting house, at a place called Keam, has been a
long time frequented by a small number of nonjurors; but
there are equally well affected to government as the others
who attend the church.

   Poor.-The poor in this parish have no other funds but
the weekly collections in the church, which amounts to 15 L.
or 161. yearly, which is given among them according as the
minister and elders see need.
   The stipend here is 128 bolls barley, and L. 22: 15 sterl.
including communion elements.  Sir Archibald Dunbar is
the only residlng heritor, and is patron of the parish.  There
was in this parish a free chapel, called Unthank, which had
its own minister and stipend; also one at Broughead.  But
now the whole parish attend worship at Duffus, except about
too who meet at Keam; but of this 100, there are none
but attend at the church when there happens to be no ser-
mon, or a vacancy at Keam.

   Schoolmasters.-The school, here like those in many other
