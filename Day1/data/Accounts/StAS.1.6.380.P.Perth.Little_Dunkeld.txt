nied it both lime and marle, the attention of the people should
be turned to other sorts of manure.  A parish association for
encouraging the making of composts, by pointing out the pro-
perest substances, and granting premiums to such individuals
as combined them most judiciously, might be attended with
much advantage.  The grazings in the hills might be greatly
improved in some places, by the draining of bogs, and in o-
ther places, by turning water upon dry declivities.
   Many new houses have been built, and old houses allowed
to go to ruin, for six or seven years past.  Five farm houses
are two stories high, with slate roofs.  One of the tenants
pays L. 40, one L. 100, and another L. 105, of rent.  A taste
for cleanliness, and even some degree of elegance, with respect
to the articles of lodging, household furniture and dress, is be-
ginning to display itself.  Instead of mean dirty hovels, built
with stones without cement, dwelling houses are now built by
good masons with mortar, cast on the outside with lime, and
neatly finished within.  Many young men appear at church
and market dressed in English cloth and round hats, and the
young women in printed cottons or linens.  It is perhaps
to be regretted that more attention is not paid to the wool-
en manufactories, as an article of domestic industry and eco-
nomy.
