     of Strathdon.

   Minerals, Plantations, etc.-There is abundance of gra-
nite and limestone, and slate of coarse quality.  Little
use is made of the granite and slate, and not much of the 
lime, though the soil in general is well adapted to it.
There are no natural woods of consequence in the parish, but
several thriving plantations of fir.  The late Mr Forbes of
Ballabeg was the first in this part of the country who be-
gan to plant.  His improvements, considering the small-
ness of his property, are worthy of notice.  He possessed only
one farm of L. 100 Scots of yearly rent, and a mill.  He be-
gan his plantations in 1745, which he afterward extended
over upwards of 100 acres.  He built a commodious mansion-
house and offices; he improved some moor-ground, straight-
ed his fields, sowed them out with artificial grasses, and en-
closed a great part of them with stone fences and belts of
hard wood; and so much did he raise the value of his small
estate, that, besides a considerable sum arising annually
from the sale of wood, the farm is let for the ensuing year
at L. 49, 155.  Sterling.

   Antiquities, etc.-At a little distance from the church, on
the opposite (north) side of the river Don, stands the
Doun of Invernochtie, a beatiful earthen mount, evident-
ly artificial, and some time a place considerable strength.
It has been defended on the top by a wall, which is now
mostly fallen; part of it, however, on each side the gate,
is still to be seen.  Its base is sorrounded by a ditch , which
has been filled with water by a small stream (Bardock)
that comes from the adjacent hill.  This stream, entering 
the ditch at the north-west quarter, divides into two parts;
and, purling along each side of the Doun, joins at the east-
ern extremity, and falls into Don some yards below it.
This mount is of an oval form; its surface on the top mea-
sures about half an acre; at the base it is more extensive.
