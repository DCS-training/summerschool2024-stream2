rishes, if it is desired to know the number of cultivated acres,
it must be supplied from conjecture, which probably in this
case is not far from the truth.  A plough turns from 4 to 14
Orkney planks*.  The medium may be about 8 Orkney
planks arable ground to each plough.  The infield and out-
field grass, exclusive of hill-pasture, may be about as much,
or rather more.  From the best conjecture that can be
formed on this subject, the division of these parishes in
cultivated and uncultivated grounds is as follows:

<TABLE>

                                                         Acres.
Arable ground, 227 ploughs, at 9 1/3 acres to each
  plough,                                                2116
Arable spots cultivated about the village of Strom-
  ness,                                                    30
Grass-grounds, infield, outfield, and meadow,            2116
Grass-ground of Keirfiold hill, in parish of Sandwick,    400
Mosses in the parish of Stromness,                        500
570 inhabited houses, with gardens, occupying             200
Two small lochs in the parish of Sandwick,                640
Hills and uncultivated grounds,                        14,158
                                                       ------
                                      Total,           20,160

</TABLE>

   Thus it appears, that the arable ground is not one-ninth
part of the whole, and that the grass-grounds are only one-
eighth part of the whole extent; that two-thirds of the
whole consists of uncultivated hills and brakes, of no ad-
vantage but to give a little fuel, and pasture about 2000
sheep.

is 40 fathoms square, and consequently contains 1600 square fathoms.
