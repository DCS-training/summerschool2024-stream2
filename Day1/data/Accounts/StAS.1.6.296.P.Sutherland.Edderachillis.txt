he Laird of Edderachylis, if by their joint efforts James M'Leod was made
away with; and all agreeing this proposal, the plan for effecting it was
to engage a cousin of James M'Leod's, one Donald M'Leod, son to Mur-
dow, son to John Moir of Assint, to take away his life: this business, he
was reckoned the likeliest, and fittest to perform, being a notorious russian,
and, in order to hinder James's friends from prosecuting revenge afterwards
when the deed should be perpetrated by one of themselves.  The reward
promised Donald, induced him reachly to undertake it, which was, that he
should have the half of Edderachylis for himself, and his offspring, and
that the mother of this Donald M'Kay, the bastard, should become his wife.
Hercupon, a party of the Morisons from Ashir, headed by Donald M'Kay
the bastard, and Donal M'Leod, who among other qualifications, was in-
comparably skilled in handling the long bow, marched in a dark morning
for Edderachylis, though not directly towards Scoury, where James M'Leod
lived, but to some other places nearer them, where James's best friends, and
ablest supporters dwelt, in order to dispatch them first; which having done,
and three of four men, whom they surprised in their beds in their several
dwellings, cruelly slain, they proceeded to Scoury; where, after slaying two or
three more of the M'Leods, they found James, upon getting some notice
of their approach, had taken shelter in a small house he had sometime be-
fore built in the middle of a Lake in Scoury.   But with arrows, having fire
bound to them, this house, being thatched with straw or reeds, was soon
made to blaze, when he was obliged to come out; whereupon Donald, his
cousin german, killed him dead with a musket bullet.  And as James had
a son of his along with him in this island, Donald did for him also; for af-
ter he had swam to the farther side of the lake, and endeavoured to run for
hi life, he flew him with an arrow from his long bow.
James M'Leod, or M'Rory, being in this manner slain, Donald thought
himself sure of possessing at least half of Edderachylis, according to agree-
ment, by here he found himself mistaken; the Morisons now told him, he
must be content with some other reward, for that Donald M'Kay must have
all Edderachylis: whereupon Donald in a rage declared that would not do,
and immediately betaking himself to his friends in Assint, in a short time re-
turned with a body of men to take possession.  But the Morisons, aware of his
motions, prepared to meet and fight him upon his first entering the country;
