     Statistical Account

   The rest of the parish, however, is in great want of roads.
There is no private road, of any great extent, kept in even
tolerable repair, except the road to Brisbane, which was
made, and is still kept in repair at the proprietor's expence,
though it is the only communication with the upper end of
the parish where it joins Kilmacolm.
   It is proposed to make two new roads; one over the hills,
so as to communicate with Kilbirny on the east, and Dairy
on the south east, and another through to Kilmacolm on
the north east.  These improvements, which have been
often talked of, but never executed, would add considerably
to the value of the lands, and convenience of the inhabitants,
by opening a communication with many parts of the adjacent
country, at present, in a great measure, innaccessible, except
by foot passengers, or horses accustomed to the roads.  On
the south and north of the village of Largs are two large ri-
vulets or burns.  The water of Nodesdale to the north, and
Gogo to the south.
   Nodesdale is a very impetuous stream.  It runs through
Mr Brisbane's pleasure grounds, where it has often commit-
ted great depradations.  Mr Brisbane has frequently endea-
voured to imbank it, and has been at great pains and expence
in raising mounds of earth to turn its course, but in vain.
   As soon as the heavy rains come, it overcomes all obstruc-
tions, and, running with unusual impetuosity through a light
and gravely soil, has, in the course of a few years, destroyed
many acres of land to the proprietor.

   Fisheries.-The salmon caught on this coast are of the best
quality.  Since the fishermen came from the north country
great quantities have been caught, which are mostly sold at
Greenock and Port-Glasgow.  The salmon fishing is at pre-
sent rented at 27 L.  Mr Brisbane's proportion is 201.  The
rest is Lord Glasgow's and Colonel Montgomery's.
