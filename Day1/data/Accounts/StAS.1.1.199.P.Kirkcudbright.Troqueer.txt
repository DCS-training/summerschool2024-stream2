Some shell marle is found in the parish.  The fishing is let
for L. 75.  Fuel is expensive.  Coal is sold at 7 d. and 8 d.
per cwt.  Four hundred acres were lately planted, mostly
with sir and oak.  There are a considerable number of na-
tural woods.  There are 6 tour wheeled chaises, and about
50 carts.  The roads are greatly improved.  The military
road that goes from Dumfries to Portpatrick runs through
Troquire.  The high price of gain was much felt by the
poor in the years 1782 and 1783.  Several heritors contri-

which, being converted into meal were sold below the mar-
ket price.  The village of Bridgend contains many beggars.
In it, and other parts of the parish, above 40 get alms, some
by begging other from the collections and parish funds,
which amount for child murder.  Two persons have been banish-
ed.  Only one has been guilty of suicide in the course of 47
years.  A few young men 20 to sea:  Several enlist in the
army.  The mode of living and dress is much improved.
