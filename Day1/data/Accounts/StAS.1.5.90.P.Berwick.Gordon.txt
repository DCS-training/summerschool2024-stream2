better food, and mending the breed by crossing with Mr Cul-
ley's rams, they have, this year, been sold at the same age,
for fifteen and sixteen shillings.  Black cattle also are greatly
improved in number and value.  In winter 1775-6, there
were only 11 beasts fed with turnips for the butcher, and in
winter 1781-2, at the distance of only six years, there were
200 fattened in the parish, besides some scores of sheep.
This business is still continued and increased, though not so
much in the numbers of cattle sed, as in feeding them to
greater value.  L. 10 was, at that time, reckoned a great
price; now they are fed to L. 15, L. 18, and even L. 20
value.

   Population.-Since the erection of the parish of Westru-
ther, the parish of Gordon has been considered as consisting
of about 600 examinable persons.  The returns to Dr Web-
ster, in 1755, was 737 souls.  In 1771, when the first list of
examinable persons was taken by the present incumbent,
they consisted of 630, in 1778, of 530.  In 1790, they rose
to 676, and, in 1791, a particular list of all descriptions and
ages having been made, the number of souls was found to be
912.  Of these 472 are females, and 440 males.  The number
of inhabited houses is 217, so that there are more than four
to each family.  Although a register is kept, as appointed
by act of Parliament, of marriages, christenings, and bu
rials, it is so inaccurate, that no confidence can be placed in
it.  The session-clerks, in place of taking 3 d. for each mar-
riage, take it for each proclamation of banns; so that a cou-
ple, proclaimed in the parishes where each resided, and
married in a third parish, have paid three times instead of 
once.
