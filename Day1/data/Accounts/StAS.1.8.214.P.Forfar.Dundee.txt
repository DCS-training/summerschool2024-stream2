     Statistical Account

average of the marriages, for the 5 years preceding 1746,
does not exceed 56; this gives a population no greater than
53 oz; and from other reasons, it is probable, that this con-
clusion is not much below the truth.  At the cross, in the prin-
cipal street of the town, there were not in that year, above 4
or 5 houses completely built of stone, all the rest were part-
ly of wood.  No shop rented at more than 2 L., or at the ut-
most 3 L.; the retailers who rented them were generally poor,
and three shops at the cross, which three years ago were sold
for 450 L. each, were then entirely shut.  At that time, also,
there were only two churches, for public worship; and though
there were no Seceding meeting-houses, and the Independent
congregation was very inconsiderable, if one church was well
filled on Sundays, the other was nearly empty.
   We have no register of burials, that can be depended upon,
except for the last 5 years; and this we owe entirely to the
care and attention of Dr. Willison, one of our principal phy-
sicians.  As the insertion of the whole would swell this ac-
count to too great bulk, the facts which follow, as seeming
to be most important, are extracted from it.  From February
1st, 1787 to ditto 1788, the number of burials was 552; from
1788 to 1789, in which period a very malignant kind of
small pox raged, the number was 867; from 1789 to 1790,
it was 609; from 1790 to 1791, when the small pox again
raged, accompanied with the chincough, it was 840, and from
1791 to 1792, 890.  The annual average of burials, there-
fore, for there 5 years, is 752; and the proportion of deaths,
to the whole number of inhabitants, may, with probability,
be reckoned nearly that of 1 to 31.  The excels of the buri-
als in 1791, above those of any year, wherein the small pox
did not prevail, is principally to be ascribed to fresh accessions
of inhabitants; for, though a putrid sore throat was at that
time epidemical, I do not find, after the most minute inquiries,
