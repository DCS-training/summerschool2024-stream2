   is often equal to, and at times greater than, that experienced in
   England; but in spring and autumn, it is subject to sudden changes,
   which are severely felt. The climate, as a whole, however, is one
   of the purest and most salubrious in great Britain, which accounts
   for the longevity of the people, and the fewness of the diseases
   which prevail among them. The healthiness of the parish has
   been much increased by the general system of drainage begun by
   Major MIKenzie, Fodderty, in 1811, in consequence of which,
   what was formerly in a state of marsh and meadow now yield lux-
   uriant crops of grain, and the grounds which used often to be cover-
   ed with mildew have been almost, if not entirely, freed from it.
      Hydrography.-The parish is well supplied with water. Besides
   numerous springs which are chiefly perennial, there are also many
   mineral springs-some pure cbalybeate, and others strongly impreg-
   nated with hydrogen gas. Of the latter kind, two at the west end of
   the strath have been long known for their medicinal, qualities, which
   they seem to derive from the bituminous rocks mixed with beds
   of shale abounding with pyrites or sulphuret of iron, through which
   the water flows. An imperfect analysis of these springs was given
   in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772. That by Dr Thom-
   son of Glasgow in 1824 is as follows :
      "There are two wells," says he, "at a little distance from each
   other. The temperature of the lower well, on the 24th June, was
   89&deg;, and that of the upper 39 3/4/o. The day was rainy, and the tem-
   perature of the air rather under 60/o. Both had the smell of sul-
   phuretted hydrogen gas. But the upper spring was obviously
   stronger than the lower. The specific gravity of these wells was as
   follows:

    <TABLE>

			Upper well,	1.00193
			Lower well,	1.00091
      "An imperial gallon of the upper spring was found to contain
	Sulphuretted hydrogen gas,	26.167 cubic inebes.
	Sulphate of soda,		67.770 grains.
	Sulphate of lime,		39.454 do.
	Common salt,			24.728 do.
	Sulphate of magnesia,		 6.242 do.

      "An imperial gallon of the water attached to the pump-room
   yielded
	Sulphuretted hydrogen gas,      13-659 cubic inches.
      "The saline contents were similar to those of the upper spring,
   but in the proportion to them of 7 to 9,
	Sulphate of soda.		52.710 grains.
	Sulphate of lime.		30.686 do.
	Common salt,			19.233 do.
	Sulphate of magnesia,	 	 4.855 do.
