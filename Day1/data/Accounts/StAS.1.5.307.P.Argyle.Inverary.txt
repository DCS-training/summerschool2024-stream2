gard to their religious opinions, all the people of this parish
are of the Established Church.  They are, in general, humane
and peaceable, orderly and decent in their behaviour;
and there are still persons living who remember them
distinguished for their good attendance on divine worship,
and for their decent observance of the Sabbath.  At present,
though they meet no peculiar commendation on that

be justly said to prevail, particularly among the people of 
condition.  Too lavish an use of spirits, has been often com-
plained of, amongst the inferior ranks.  Dram-drinking,
however, though still too much practiced, particularly by
females of the lowest class,is happily less prevalent than
