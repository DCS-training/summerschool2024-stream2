     Statistical Account

   Climate, Disease, Hills, etc.-The air is rather moist, from
the frequent rains which prevail in the western parts of Scot-
land, but this circumstance does not appear to affect the
health of the inhabitants, many of whom die of old age.
Consumptions, fevers, and sore throats, are the most com-
mon diseases in this parish.  The most remarkable hill in
the parish is the Misty-Law, which rises to the height of 1240
feet above the level of the sea; and commands from its sum-
mit an extensive and varied prospect over 12 counties, inclu-
ding the Frith of Clyde, and the islands of Arran, Bute, Ail-
sa, etc.  This hill is surrounded by the muirland part of the
parish, which abounds with game, and affords tolerable pas-
ture for sheep.

   Lakes, Fish, Birds, Rivers, and Mills.-There are two
lakes in this parish, Castlesemple Loch, and QueensideLoch.  The
former was, some time ago, attempted to be drained with-
out success, and is now made a most beautiful piece of water,
containing above 400 acres, in which there are plenty of pikes,
perches, and eels.  It also abounds with swans, geese, ducks,
teals, bitterns, and other kinds of wild fowl.  The beauty of
this piece of water is considerably increased, by the well dres-
sed grounds and good quantity of wood which surrounds it.
Queenside Loch is situated in the muirs, and contains about
21 acres; it forms an excellent reservoir, for supplying two
large cotton mills in the village of Lochwinnoch.  The prin-
cipal rivers are the Calder, whose banks, from a union of
wood, water and rugged rocks, exhibit a variety of roman-
tic and picturesque scenery, and the Black Cart.  The Cal-
der flows into CastlesempleLoch, and the Black Cart is the
inlet from it.  On these two rivers, 7 very large cotton
mills have been erected within these few years.
