bing tide. They are sold from Is. to 2s. 6d. the hundred, and

Manufactures.-A potato-flour manufactory has lately been
erected on the farm of East Flisk. Two men and three women
are employed in it. Their time of labour'is the same with that
of other servants on the farm ; and their occupation seems by no
means prejudicial to health. The potatoes are grated down by a
rough.revolving cylinder kept in motion by a steam engine of
two horse power. The machine is the fruit of Mr Morton's own
mechanical ingenuity.
Navigation.-Although the Tay, in its main channel, sweeps
along the length of the parish, it is of little avail for shipping, from
want of a pier.Coal, tile, stone, and slate are.occasionally land-
ed, but grain cannot be shipped.
