very hardy and intrepid as pilots, go out boldly to meet
ships in the greatest storms, and have the character of being
as ready and discreet as any on the coast.  On the Keith
Inch, the north part of which is called the Greenhill, there
are several excellent houses, and some respectable families.
Here, on, the southermost part is an old castle, built by
George Earl Marischal in the beginning of last century.
He was employed at the Court of Denmark on an embassy,
and brought over the Princess of Denmark, who was mar-

placed at the mouth of the two harbours, besides some brass
pieces in the tolbooth, which were all carried to London
after the year 1715.  The Keith Inch formerly at stream-

from the North to the South Harbour.  This is now pre-
vented by a mound of earth, raised so high as never to be
overflowed by the sea; on the north side of this are placed
the flesh-house, a number of sheds for coals, lime, and tim-
ber, and a salt manufacture; on the south side is the ware-
house, two small docks or flips for ship-building, and the
South Harbour.

   Harbours.-There are two harbours, the North and the

pier of very large stones on the north east side, without any
cement, but which seldom needs repairs; ships sometimes
enter this harbour, and are laid up for the winter; in gene-
ral, it is only employed by large boats from the Murray
