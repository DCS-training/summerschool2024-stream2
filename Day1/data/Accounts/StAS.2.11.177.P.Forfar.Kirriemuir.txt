trose, in whom De Retz saw realized the abstract idea of the
heroes of antiquity; and Viscount Dundee, who fell in the arms
of victory, although the severity of his temper, and the rigour with
which he executed the oppressive mandates of the princes whom
he served, can never he justified or palliated.
	Shielhill, on the banks of the South Esk, the property of
Charles Lyell, Esq. of Kinnordy, enjoys perhaps the finest situa-
tion in the parish. *

				III.--POPULATION.
	In 1801, the population, by the census, amounted to   4421
	   1811,                                              4791
           1821,                                              5056
           1831,                                              6425
	The increase of population is supposed to be owing to the policy
which has of late prevailed, of converting small farms into large
ones. The surplus population of country parishes being obliged
in consequence to congregate in towns, Kirriemuir has receiv-
ed its full share of this emigration, from the increased facility for
building, occasioned by the division of a commonty long in dispute,
and the prospect of employment which the thriving state of the
linen manufacture held out. The number of the population re-
siding in the town, including the suburbs, is 4014; reriding in the
villages of Marytown and Ellenertown, 236; and residing in the
country, 2125.
