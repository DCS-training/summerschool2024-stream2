   Antiquities.-The battle of Sheriffmuir took place in this parish
in 1715, between the Earl of Mar and the Marquis of Argyle,
which established the throne in the house of Hanover.
   The great relic of antiquity in this parish is its cathedral.
Date of its erection uncertain, possibly 1140, in the reign of
David I.  None of the diocesan records are known to exist.
The nave is 130 feet by 58. It was unroofed probably at the Re-

by 30.  There were no transepts.  The tower is 128 feet high,
und seems, from its three different styles of architecture, to have
been erected in three successive periods.  Probably a church
