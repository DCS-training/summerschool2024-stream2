               proved the origin of the great secession from the Church of Scot-
               land.  He was translated from Forteviot to Aberd`lgie 31st De-
               cember 1718.
                  From 1717 to 1736 the volume of the kirk-session records has
               either been lost or destroyed.
                  Mr Thomas Rankine, who was ordained minister of Kinnoull
               in 1733, was translated to Aberdalgie in November 1745, and
               died in 1781; when Mr William Garvie succeeded him on Ja-
               nuary 10, 1782.  Mr Garvie was translated from West Calder,
               and died in 1831, at an advanced age; when he was succeeded by
               the present incumbent, Mr Charles C. Stewart, on March 15, 1832.
                 Dupplin Castle.-The castle mentioned in the last Statistical
               Account was burned to the ground by accident on the IIth Sep-
               tember 1827, and in the course of five years afterwards, a new
               and very handsome edifice was erected on the same site by the
               present Thomas Robert Drummond Hay, Earl of Kinnoull, under
               the auspices of Mr Burn of Edinburgh, after the Elizabethan
               style of architecture, at a sum exceeding L.30,000. The greater
               part of the valuable library and paintings were fortunately pre-
               served from the conflagration, though some valuable manuscripts
               of historical hnterest were unfortunately destroyed.
                 The Lords Oliphant of Bachilton were for centuries the feudal
               lords of Aberdalgie.  A full account of this ancient family is given
               in Douglas's and Crawford's Peerage.

                                        III-POPULATION.
                 At every decade since the beginning of the  century the popu-
               lation has been decreasing.

                               Amount of population in 1801,        542
                                                       1811,        513
                                                       1821,        490
                                                       1831,        434
                                                       1841,        360

                 The principal causes of the decrease seem to be the throwing
               of small farms into larger ones, and the decay or destruction of
               cottars' houses, while fewer are erected than those which were de-
               stroyed.  The farmers consequently complain of want of labour-
               ers, especially during the spring and harvest, when they find it
               requisite tO send to the town of Perth for labourers.

                 Agriculture.-This parish is not behind the rest of the district
               in its agricultural improvements.  The most essential of these
               has certainly been the system of wedge-draining, now so generally
