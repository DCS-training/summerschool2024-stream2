on the point of Arnish, that will enable vessels to make the harbour
at night,--which attempt, hitherto, was not considered advisable
but by those well acquainted with the ground. The site had been
chosen and fixed upon by the proprietor, and Captain Benjamin
Oliver of his Majesty's Revenue Cruizer Prince of Wales. There
is one rope-walk here.
  		         III.--POPULATION.
   The ancient state of the population of the parish is, at present,
unknown. The records, which might have thrown some light on
that subject, were lost in 1740. Formerly, the presbyteries of Lewis
and Uist were united and called the presbytery of the Long Island.
During their union, for the accommodation of members, the presbytery
seat was migratory; and it is reported that, when a member
of presbytery was returning to Lewis, the boat upset, the crew and
passengers drowned, and the records lost.

   Various causes may have contributed to increase the popula-
tion. A brisk trade in fishing contributed considerably to its
increase, for a period of eight years. From 1800 to 1808, a sum
of L. 70,000 was circulated by means of the herring, cod, and ling
fishings, and oil. The extension of arable land or moss brought
into culture, and the poverty of the people in the neighbouring
parishes, tend to increase the population of Stornoway. Those who
cannot emigrate to foreign lands, congregrate in Stornoway, for
the purpose of getting work. The population of the island is estimated
at 14,000. The number residing in the town and within
a mile of Stornoway, is 3000: the number residing in the country,
viz. the districts of Gress and Ui, is 2561.
