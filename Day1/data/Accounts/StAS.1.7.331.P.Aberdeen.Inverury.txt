north-west from Aberdeen.

   Soil.-The parish of Inverury contains about 4000 acres,
but scarce 2000 are arable.-The land near the rivers is gene-

   The Borough.-The town of Inverury, where the parish
church stands, is a royal borough.  Tradition says, that it
obtained this privilege from King Robert Bruce, on occasion
of a signal victory obtained by him there, over Comyn Earl
