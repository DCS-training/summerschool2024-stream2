for investing the management of it for a term of years in distinct
commissioners. These commissioners were selected partly from
the magistrates, and partly from other public bodies of the town.
Much pains were taken to procure the most approved plans; and
after all preliminaries had been settled, the work was begun, and
carried on with extraordinary spirit; every thing was done in the
most substantial manner; and yet long within the time contem-
plated, the present harbour, consisting of a wet dock of about six
acres,-a tide harbour of much greater extent,-a graving-dock
capable of containhng at once three of the largest class of mer-
chant vessels frequenting the Tay,-extensive carpenters' and other
yards for ship-building, &c.,-wide and spacious quays, affordidg
birthage for about thirty vessels to load or discharge at the same
time,-was happily completed. From the moment this superior ac-
commodation was begun to be provided, the number and tonnage
of our ships increased, and, of course, the extent of the trade and
commerce of the port was greatly enlarged.
	Works so extensive, and from their nature so difficult to erect,
necessarily created a very great expense; but that expense has
been incurred judiciously, and to great advantage both to the trust
and to the public. From 1815, the date of the commencement
of the new harbour, down to May 1833, the following are the
items both of the expenditure and of the receipt.-
