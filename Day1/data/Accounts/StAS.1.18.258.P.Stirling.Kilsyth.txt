     Statistical Account

   To the honour of all denominations of christians in this
parish, they are always ready to contribute in a private capa-
city, when the circumstances of the poor require them to do so.
During the inclement winter 1795, when every labourer was
entirely idle, and almost every class of tradesmen, a subscrip-
tion was opened for the feeble, the aged, and the infirm, and
for the honest and industrious, who could not find employ-
ment, but were unwilling to come upon the parish.  In the
course of a few days, upwards of L. 11 were collected from
the common orders of the inhabitants of every different com-
munion; and by the concurrence of the heritors, it was
raised at last above L. 30.  The non-residing heritors not
only concurred in this design, but have agreed to give a
handsome sum yearly, for the support of the poor; an
example truly laudable and worthy of imitation.
   The ordinary poor which are not very numerous, are
chiefly supported by the weekly collections at the church.
But there are seldom above 10, and never above 15
upon the weekly list; these receive from 2 s. 6 d. to 4 s. 6 d.
monthly, each according to their several necessities.  But by
far the greatest sum goes to the supply of the occasional poor.
And that none may be overlooked, the session meets weekly
all the year round; and in winter they meet always twice,
sometimes thrice, for the purpose of giving more liberal
supplies than can be afforded weekly.  At Martinmass,
New-years-day, and Candlemass, they distribute from
L. 3 to L. 4 ster. either in money or in coals, or cloaths,
to all without distinction who stand in need of them.  Some-
times this occasional supply amounts to L. 20 ster. in the
winter; besides what is expended in the education of some
orphans and many poor children.
   Yet our funds have hitherto been sufficient; so that there
has not been an assessment in this parish for a century past,
