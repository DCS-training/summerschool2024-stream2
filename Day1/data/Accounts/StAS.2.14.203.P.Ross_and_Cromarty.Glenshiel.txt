                               IV.-INDUSTRY.
            The number of acres of land which is either constantly or occa-
         sionally in tillage may be about 280.  The number' which remains
         constantly in pasture 71,600.  The number that might be culti-
         vated with advantage does not probably exceed 50.  There is no
         land in a state of undivided common.  The number of acres un-
         der wood cannot be less than 70.  The natural woods are not ju-
         diciously managed.  No attention is bestowed on thinning them.
         The trees are cut, before they attain to a proper size, and they are
         much injured by breaking off the branches for fuel, a practice
         which the scarcity of that article renders common, and which occa-
         sions the early decay of the trees from the effects of the wet they
         receive by the wounds thus made.
            Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land, taking that of
         the large farms at L.1, and of the lots at L.2 per acre, may be
         stated at L.1, 10s.  The average rent of pasture is reckoned at
         L.2, 10s. for each cow, including provender for winter, and the
         rearing of a calf till he is a year old, or L.1, 1Os. for summer grass,
         15s. for wintering, and 5s. for the calf; 1Os. is the usual charge
         for summer pasturing young cattle.  The average rent paid for a
         ewe of the cross or Cheviot breeds is 2s. 6d., of the black-faced
         breed 2s., both being reckoned from the age of seven months.            '
            Wages.-Farm-servants are usually hired for the year; males at
         a wage of from L.7 to L.8; females L.2, 1Os., and fed in the
