     Statistical Account

   failure of crop in 1782 was less felt here than in many other
parts of the kingdom.  The poor belonging to the Camero-
nians and Seceders receive supplies from the parochial funds;
yet not one of these fects contribute a farthing to the main-
tenance of the parish poor:  Moreover, many of the establish-
ed church attend their meetings on particular days, which
adds to their collections.

   Wages.-Labourers have sufficient employment, and are
able to support their families.  The wages of a man servant,
employed in the operations of husbandry, were L. 2 per annum
40 years ago; now they are L. 7.  The wages of a woman 
servant, 40 years ago, were 13 s. 4 d.; now L. 3.  About
40 years ago, a day labourer received 6 d. without victuals,
now he receives 1 s.  Carpenters wages are 1 s. 4 d. a day;
masons 1 s. 8 d.; taylors 1 s.  They are all doubled.  A man
during harvest, 40 years ago, got 8 s. 4 d.; a woman 5 s.  Now
a man gets L. 1: 3: 0, and a woman 18 s.  Few reap by the 
day; but, when they do, they receive from 10 d. to 1 s. 2 d.
without victuals.

   Church and Stipend.-The church was rebuilt in 1782.  It
is pleasantly situated on an eminence on the Scarr.  The sti-
pend is L. 86: 2: 2, with a glebe worth L. 11, consisting of
9 acres.  The Duke of Queensberry is patron.

   Improvements Suggested.-The repairing of roads, searching
for coal, lead, and iron mines, might be attended with ad-
vantage.  The division of some farms, and the establishment
of a woollen manufactory, in particular, would be of great
benefit.  Vast quantities of wool and woollen yarn are car-
ried out of this, and the neighbouring parishes, to a great 
distance.  Penpont is to centrical, that it is said the farmers
