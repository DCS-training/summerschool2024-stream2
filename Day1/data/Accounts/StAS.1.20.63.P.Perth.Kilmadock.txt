few well dressed fields are to be seen in the property of emi-
nent improvers, but the rugged face of nature still covers
the greatest part.  There can be no perfect husbandry un-
less the fields are regular.  A slope in a field is no disad-
vantage; but sudden hollows, intermixed with mounds, will
never yield regular crops.  Besides, these hollows are gene-
rally wet, while the mound is parched, and thus the field ri-
pens unevenly.  Levelling and draining ought, therefore,
to go hand in hand.  Sometimes the levelling of a field will
supply the place of draining; or draining may answer the
purpose of levelling.
   While the grounds are neither drained nor levelled, it
cannot be expected the farmer will perceive the advantage
of inclosures.  If you suggest the inclosing of a field, the
answer is, that, by inclosing and subdividing, the half of the
grass (meaning the places requiring to be drained and le-
velled, and which are used for grass) would then be lost.
The farmers should first be taught the practice of draining
and levelling; and whenever the useless corners of the fields
are brought into culture, an inclosure would become an ob-
vious advantage.
   3. Clearing of Stones.-The grounds on the north side of
Teith are very much infested with stones, that obstruct and
break the plough; and several fields are wholly covered
over with round bullets, giving the grounds a very waste
and barren appearance.
   It is unnecessary to mention the propriety of clearing the
fields of stones, especially those that obstruct the plough.
Carrying stones off a field is gaining so much additional
ground, for the trifling expence of carriage.  Some farmers
will gravely tell you, that the fields are the better of the
stones that lie on them.  There never was a more miserable
excuse for laziness.  Stones lying on a field can surely be
of no use, except to occupy, perhaps, the half of the surface,
