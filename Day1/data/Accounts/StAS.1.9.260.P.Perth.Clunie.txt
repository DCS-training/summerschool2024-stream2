scene of some very remote and important transaction.-However natural it
may be for every Caledonian to wish to know the scene of the decisive en-
gagement between Galgacus and Agricola it is highly probable that that
scene will never be precisely ascertained.  Our only information on that
subject, is derived from Tacitus, who, though he gives us a most animated
description of the engagement itself, leaves us very much in the dark as to
the scene of it.  From him we learn only, that it must be somewhere at
the foot of the Mons Grampius; but every one knows that the Grampian
Mountains traverse the whole extent of Scotland, from the vicinity of A-
berdeen to the district of Cowal in Argyleshire.  In this extensive range,
there have been four different places, and there considerably distant from
one another, supposed to be each of them the field of this battle.-The
first of these is at Fortingale, at the foot of Glenlyon, in the very centre
of the Grampians, where the vestiges of a camp, apparently Roman, are
still visible.  But it is not likely that such an experienced General as A-
gricola would have ventured to draw off his legions so far from the fleet,
through the defiles of the mountains, where they would be every moment
in danger of being surprised, and cut off by a bold and resolute enemy,
who knew that country too well, not to take advantage of it; and, at
any rate, the scene at Fortingale is too much hemmed in by high moun-
tains, and every way too limited, to admit of such an extensive engage-
ment as that described by Tacitus.-The second spot is at Comrie, near the
head of Strathein, where there is likewise the appearance of a Roman
camp, and where the scene, indeed, is less circumscribed than the former;
but here also objections occur.  The strath is narrow below and above,
and the mountains rise boldly from the vale.  The general face of the
country does not seem to accord with many of the expressions of Tacitus;
nor does it appear well calculated for bringing into action the troops of
horse, (turmae equitum,) and the currus of covint, the hook-armed
chariots or cars of the Caledonians, which they then used in common with
the other Britons.  We do not recollect, at Comrie, any remarkable ap-
pearance of tumuli, indicating the scene of such a battle.  And here also
the Roman army would have been too distant from the fleet, which is
supposed, with great probability, to have been then riding at anchor in
the mouth of the Tay.-The third place alleged to be the scene of the
