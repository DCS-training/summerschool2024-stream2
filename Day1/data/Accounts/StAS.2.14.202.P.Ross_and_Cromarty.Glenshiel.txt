       it would be tedious to detail, have sliewn, that, with all their pa-
       tient endurance of hardship, there is a point beyond which oppres-
       sion becomes dangerous, especially when exercised in a shape cal-
       culated to irritate the suppressed but not yet extinct feelings of
       the Highlander.  In illustration of the moral character of the
       people, it may be mentioned, that a slight wooden latch, to ex-
       clude the cattle, is all the fastening that is deemed necessary for
       the door of a house in the absence of the family; that instances of
       theft are very rare; that no illegitimate child has been born in
       the parish for the last three years, that no murder or robbery has
       been committed in the parish within the memory of man; and
       that, for the last eighty years, no native of the parish, or indivi-
       dual of the name of Macrae, has been convicted of a felony.
       This freedom from crime may be ascribed in part to the influence
       of a species of local patriotism, through which each individual
       member of the community is deterred from the commission of
       any improper act, by the consideration of the disgrace which might
       accrue from his misconduct, to his country; but chiefly to the
       constraining force of a deep though unostentatious feeling of
       piety and religious principle, with which the minds of the people
       are imbued.  Of the first of these salutary influences, the power
       is gradually giving way before the increasing intercourse with
       strangers, and the other, it is to be feared, will prove no more than
       sufficient to counteract the force of the various demoralizing agen-
       cies which are now at work among them.
          Among these, the practice of smuggling holds the first place.
       Illicit distillation, which was introduced about twenty years since,
       prevails, especially upon the estate of Letterfearn, to an extent that
       threatens to prove destructive to all habits of regular industry, inju-
       rious to the health, and ruinous to the morals of its victims; and is
       likely to continue to produce these distressing results, until the own-
       ers of the land choose to discountenance it. The consequences of
       the praiseworthy conduct of some of the neighbouring proprietors
       prove, that, while the severe, but desultory, and therefore ineffec-
       tual exertions of the revenue officers have failed of putting down
       this baneful mischief, a isimple prohibition on the part of the land-
       owners, under the sanction of a threat of removal, will at'once ef-
       fect an object so desirable.
          Poaching in game and salmon is practised to some extent by
       young men in the-higher parts of the parish, but does not prevail
       to such a degree as to influence the general habits of the people.
