in Scotland, namely, the Bower-tree.  A great number of
beautiful oaks ornament the estate of Ballikinrain.  The
largest, and probably the oldest in the parish, grows in full
vigour at Killearn place.  The trunk is 12 feet circum-
ference, and supports many stately branches that widely
display a foliage uncommonly pleasant.  No production of
the vegetable kingdom in this parish is, however, more re
markable than two large yew trees at Ballikinrain.  One
is the berry bearing kind, the other not.  The trunk of the
former is 8 feet in circumference, of the latter, 10 feet 8
inches.  They are only 9 feet separate from each other,
making the appearance, at a distance, of a single tree only
they are about 60 feet in height.  Nine large branches
strike off from the male plant, at the height of 6 feet from
the ground: they make a beautiful curve downwards, so
that their extremities touch the earth, and cover an area of
18 yards diameter, forming a most agreeable shade, impe-
netrable at all times to rain.  As there is no account, event
by tradition, when they were planted, their age must be
great.  They are frequented by a considerable number of
the golden crested wren, (Motacila Regulus), the smallest
bird in Europe, and, except the humming bird, probably
in the world.  They build their nests under the curving
extremities of the branches, where the foliage is thickest,
Their nests are constructed with exquisite art, and are sus-
pended under the twigs, like so many little baskets from
the ceiling of a room.
   This part of the country is far from being destitute of
exotic plants in a high degree of perfection.  This is par-
ticularly the case with respect to the larix, a great number
of which adorn the banks and inclosures at the house of
Killearn.  They are about 60 years old, being among the
first of the kind that were planted in the open field in Scot-
land; they are generally 3 feet diameter at the thickest,
