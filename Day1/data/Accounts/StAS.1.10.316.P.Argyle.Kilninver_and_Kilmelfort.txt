   Soil and Surface.-The lower parts of these parishes on
the W. are generally smooth sloping declivities towards the
sea, and consist of light loam upon gravel or rock, yielding,
when properly cultivated, and in favourable seasons, good
crops of corn, bear, and potatoes.  The upper parts, towards
the E. and S. are mountainous, environed with a ridge of
hills, which separate them from the parishes of Kilmore,
Dallavich, and Craignish.  The soil in Gleneuchar, and the
Braes of Lorn in the parish of Kilninver, and in the higher
lands in the parish of Kilmelfort is poor and gravelish,
yielding little crop, fit only for pasturage, and occupied most-
ly with sheep.  A few farms, however, are stocked almost
wholly with black cattle.-There is in these parishes a good
deal of natural wood such as oak, ash, birch, hazel, aller,
etc.  Some parts also are planted with firs, which thrive
very well.  The tops of the hills, none of which are remark-
ably high or rugged, are covered with heath interspersed with
stripes of coarse pasture, well adapted for sheep.

   Sea Coast.-These united parishes have six miles of a sea
coast towards the N. and W. from the middle of Lochsea-
chin, to the west end of the Sound of Clacharsoail.  In the
mouth of Lochseachin, a bank of land lies across its channel;
and, therefore, it is navigable only by small craft of about
50 or 60 tons burden.  At the foot of the Water of Euchar,
and without this bank, two points of high land jutting out
into the Sound of Mull, form a wide extensive bay with
good anchoring ground, but somewhat exposed to the N. W.
the stormy quarter on this coast.  From thence to the Sound
of Clachansoail, there is a bold, rocky, and dangerous coast.
The Sound of Clachansoail is about two miles long, and se-
parates the Island of Soail and parish of Kilbrandan from
the Continent.  The Sound is narrow, being no more than
