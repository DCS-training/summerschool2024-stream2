the case in the present day: the farmers are active, industrious,
and prosperous.
   The great want in this parish is shelter,-the farms, for the
most part, being quite exposed to the sweep of the east and west
winds.  There is also a great deficiency in draining.  About two
years ago the Medwin, which ran in innumerable windings, was
straightened for the distance of three miles.  This work, however,
has not been sufficiently done, as the water at the under part of
the cut overflows its banks, in consequence of a mill-dam, which
keeps back the water.  This should be entirely removed to render

the straightening effectual.  Were the flat through which the cut
runs sufficiently drained by ditches into the river, there would be
recovered not less than 400 acres of the best land in the parish,-
all of a deep rich water-borne soil, composed of decayed vegetables,
and likely to be worth more than one-half of all the land under
cultivation.
   At present the principal road runs from the one end of the pa-
rish to the other nearly parallel with the river, at the distance of
half a mile, and at the east end joins the public road from Edin-
burgh to Biggar by a very circuitous route.  Whereas, were if to
be continued straight east through the Garvald, to join the same
road near Linton, it would open up a most advantageous commu-
nication.
