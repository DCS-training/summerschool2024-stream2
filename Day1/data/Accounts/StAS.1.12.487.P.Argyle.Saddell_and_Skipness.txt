except in the summer season, and in times of great scarcity.
They are supported partly by the collections in church, pri-
vate charities, and their own industry; very few of them
beg from door to door.  But the parish is much harrassed with 
strolling beggars from Ireland, the Highland Isles, the Low
Country, and from the northern parts of Scotland.

   Ecclesiastical State.-There are two churches, neither of
them old, being built since the erection 1753; they are 13
miles distant from each other, and about 6 miles from the
extremities; they are in good repair, but still unenclosed, 
and without bells, and other conveniencies necessary for the
clergyman, when performing duty at a distance from his own
house, and where he can find no proper accomodation for
himself, or his horse;  to be forced to look for it in a publick
house, is both disagreeable and expensive.  The glebe was
designed, and the manse built in 1772, in a situation extreme-
ly cold, and exposed to violent storms; 4 miles from one
church, and 9 from the other.  The glebe consists of about
20 acres, Scots measure, of very bad moor, and two acres
arable.  The sum allotted for building the manse, was only
146 L. 10 s; a part of the finishing within, and the offices,
were put off to a future period; and nothing has been done as
to either, except what the incumbent has done for his interim
accomodation, at his own expense.  He believes the heri-
tors intend soon to make up these deficiencies. The present
living is 49 bolls bear, 15 bools meal, and about 17 L. Ster-
ling money, per decreet of locality, by which all the recover-
able teinds are exhausted.-Patron, his Grace the Duke of
Argyll.

neral, of a sober, honest, and hospitable disposition.  Few
