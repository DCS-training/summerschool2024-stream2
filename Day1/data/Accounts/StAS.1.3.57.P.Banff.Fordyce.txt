found a stone coffin of flag or flat stones, and in it the
bones of a chieftain lying in their natural order; and a
deer's horn, a symbol of the chief's being a hunter.  The
stones, of which sort there were few in the neigh-
bourhood, by the shells of the pholades, or muscles, in-
cluded in many of them, seem principally to have been
brought from the sea.  The quantity, distance, and dif-
ficulty of access, seem to have required an army, or
large district of country to transport them.  This burrow is
now the site of a wind-mill.  There had been another com-
paratively very small burrow, at about a hundred paces dis-
tance from the largest.  It had been constructed by casting
up a trench round it, which still remains; but the earth of
the tumulus has been long ago carried off.  Another bur-
row was likewise broken up at Kilhllock in Findlater some
years ago.  It was entirely a cairn of stones; and in remov-
ing them for the purpose of inclosing, an urn was found, and
likewise of stone coffin covering skeleton.  The tenant was
greatly surprised, and, that he might not suffer for violating;
burial ground, he carefully interred the bones, and the pieces
of the urn, at a marked place in the inclosure.  Another tu-
mulus was likewise broken up in the contiguous farm of
Brankamentum, through the curiosity of Mr Duncan of
Broom, where there was found an urn containing ashes; it
was very hard, and the clay well baked.  In the 10th cen-
tury, the Danes landed at the mouth of the burn of Cullen;
King Indulfus came up, beat them, and obliged them to re-
embark; but was slain at the end of the engagements, in a
corner of a wood, where he fell in with an unbroken party
of the Danes.  It is a matter of uncertainty whether the
battle was sought in this parish, or in that of Rathven on the
west of Cullen, where remains the King's Cairn, in the
