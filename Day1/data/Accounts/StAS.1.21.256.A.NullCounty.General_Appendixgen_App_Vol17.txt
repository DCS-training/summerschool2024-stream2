company, and died in Ireland.  Otho afterwards was lieute-
nant-colonel of the 59th regiment.  He is still alive.  Goutish
habits, brought on by an active and fatiguing service of half
a century's continuance, made him retire.  His only son, like
his father, is a gallant and spirited officer.  He is captain in
the horse guards; and wrote the history of the campaigns
1793 and 1794, in which he served with general appro-
bation.
   A branch of this military family of Olivestob settled in the
beginning of last century in Sweden; of whom Count Ha-
milton is the representative, and governor of one of the pro-
vinces of Sweden.
   Three grandsons of Mr James Hamilton of Olivestob, viz.
Capt. John Wemyss of the 59th regiment, Capt. William
Sinclair Wemyss of the 48th regiment, and Capt. Francis
Wemyss, late of the Grenada packet, now master of one of
his Majesty's fourth-rate ships of war, went early into the ser-
vice of their country; and another of his grandsons, Otho
Herman Wemyss, was admitted advocate in 1785, 82 years
after the admission of his grandfather.
   Grizel Urquhart, daughter to Colonel Alexander Ur-
quhart of Newhall, and niece to Mr Hamilton, was Countess
of Carnwath.  Mary Erskine, niece to his wife, was Coun-
tess of Kintore; and Elizabeth Urquhart, the younger sister
of Lady Carnwath, was married to his son Major Hamilton.
   If there be merit, in this country, in serving honourably
at the bar, in the field, and in the navy; the public, at least,
will wish it suitably rewarded, when long and well earned
by families like there, to which this parish hath an immediate
relation.
