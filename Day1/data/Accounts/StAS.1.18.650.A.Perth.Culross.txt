     St Serf.

ANECDOTES of St Serf, from Winter's Chronicle, a M. S. in
the Cotton Library:  Winter lived in the end of the 14th,
and beginning of the 15th century: he was a Canon re-
gular of St Andrew's, and Prior of the Monastery of
Loch-leven.  An excerpt from his Chronicle is published
by Pinkerton, in a collection of old Scots poems, which
gives the following account of St Serf.

   ST SERF, was son to the King of Canaan, and resigned his
paternal inheritance to a younger brother, that he might be
at liberty to travel.  About the death of Pope John III.
A. D. 511, he came to Rome, and according to the legend,
was raised to the papacy, which he held 7 years: (This, Pin-
kerton thinks to be a fable, and gives it as his opinion, that
St Serf was a native of Italy.) Setting out from Rome, and
travelling through France, he arrived at the opposite shore to
Britain, where he embarked with his retinue of 100 men
and after a prosperous voyage, arrived at the Island of Inch-
keith, between Leith and Kinghorn; there he was visited by
Sanct Adaman; then Abbot of Icolum-kil; (Inch-colm I sup-
pose,) and intreated to come to Fife.  In compliance with
the holy man's request, he left Ineh-keith, and arrived at
Dyfart, and proceeding from thence by water, came to Kin-
niel.- What follows is in Winter's language:
     Syne at Kinniel he came to land;
     There our the water he kest his wande,
     That suddenly grew in a tree,
     And bare of applis great plente;
     And that stede astyray,
     Morglass was called mony day.
     Syne our the water, of purpose,
     Of Forth he passed till Culrosse;
     Quhar that he thought a kirk to found.
