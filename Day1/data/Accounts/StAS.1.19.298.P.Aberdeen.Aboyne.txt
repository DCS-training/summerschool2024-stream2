broath.  Another of these mountains, Month Kean, is
seen from the coast of Buchan, at the distance of above 40
miles, and serves as a barometer to the interjacent country.
When the conical top of Month Kean is covered with a
cloud, the people in the lower parts of the county seldom
fail to have rain within 24, or at most 36 hours.

   Rivers.-The principal river, which runs through the
whole extent of these parishes, is the Dee, which abounds
in salmon, sea-trout, and burn-trout, or fresh-water trout.
These are only caught with the rod, and sell at from 3 d. to
4 d. per lb. according to the season of the year.  The infe-
rior rivers are the Feuch, which runs along the lands sur-
rounded by the parish of Birse, and falls into the Dee about
12 miles below Aboyne; the Tanar, and the Allachy,
which runs into the Tanar, and along with it falls into the
Dee about a mile above Aboyne.  All these rivers are re-
markably clear, but very rapid, and swell suddenly to a
great degree, which renders them very dangerous.

   Woods.-Besides a considerable quantity of different
kinds of wood planted in the parish of Aboyne, there is a
very large forest of natural wood in Glentanar, the greatest
length of which is ten, and the breadth six English miles.
This forest produces Scotch fir (a species of pine) of a very
good quality, which grows on the sides of the hills; but
from the great elevation, no wood grows near the top of the
highest mountains.  There is a great demand for this wood,
which brings Lord Aboyne from L. 400 to L. 500 yearly.
It was sold, till lately, at 3 d. per cubic foot; but for some
years past at 4 d. in lots, or prizings, as they call it, and in
picked trees at 5 d. per cubic foot; within these few weeks
(in June 1796) it has been raised to 6 d. the foot.  The
axe-men are particularly alert in picking out and cutting
