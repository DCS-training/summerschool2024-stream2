full of pretty good pasture, and here and there a green spot,
with huts upon them; to which the women, children, and
herds, retire with the cattle for the summer season.  De-
scending still farther down, the air and the soil generally
change for the better; but, in some places, the hills, within
sight of the rivers, are stoney and bad.  The vestiges of the
plough are often seen much higher up, than it goes at pre-
sent; probably because the wood then, made higher places
warmer, and much of the bottom was a thicket.-In the
sides of the glens and valleys, the foil is various;-in several
places it is thin a light, as it is also in the bottoms, where
the rivers once ran; in other places it is good, especially
where the veins of limestone run from N.E. to S.W. through
the country.  In the summer season, the face of the country
is green, with corn, grafs, and wood.  In the bottom of eve-
ry green and valley, there is a  river, or stream; and in some of
them, a loch, or lake.  An extensive strath, of valley, lies a-
long the Garry, from the Kirktown of Strowan, for 6 miles
downwards; and Strath-tummel runs along the loch of that
name, which is 2 miles long.  The rest of the parish cosists
ot many glens, along the rivulets, that fall from the moun-
tains, and of rocks, and extensive hills; of which very little
more is capable of cultivation.

   Mountains and Hills.-In these parishes are many considera-
ble mountains; but the most remarkable of them are Beinn-
deirg, i.e. the Red Mountain, (so called from a vein of red
stone, said to be a kind of granite), which rises 3550 sect a-
bove the level of the sea; and Beinn-glo, the highest pinnacle
of which, Carn-mam-gour, i.e. the Mountain of Goats, rises
3724 feet above the said level.
Srath-dhrnaidh, in Strath-groy, is one of those roundish
green hills, that they call Sioth dhun, i.e. the Hill of Peace;
