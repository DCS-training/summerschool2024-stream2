period, there has been only one tried by the justiciary, for
violently beating a man in his own house; and such were the
alleviating circumstances of the case, that the pannel was only
punished with a few weeks imprisonment.  It may not be im-
proper to compare with this, the state of morals in this pa-
rish about 180 years age.  It appears, from the register for-
merly mentioned, that from 1610, to 1620, the most fla-

guilty of fishing, and selling their fish openly in Maybole
market; that others winnowed their corn, and gave no rea-
son for so doing, but that the wind was favourable; that
others openly washed and dryed their cloaths; and that others
were guilty of tuellying, as it is called, or fighting to the effu-

even on the Sabbath, that we find the session enacting, that
no inn-keeper should sell on that day, more than two pints
of ale to a company of three persons.  It further appears, from
the same register, that the vice of adultery was also very fre-
quent.  It would seem, however, that the morals of the peo-
ple after the year 1630, improved to a considerable degree,
and continued to improve long after 1640, when, as we have
mentioned, the solemn league and covenant was signed in this
parish.

creased.  Forty years ago, the number of monthly pensioners
upon the roll, was only seven.  At present, the number is 21,
who receive from 1 s. 6d. to 3 s. every month.  These dis-
tributions are under the management of the minister and kirk-
session.  At two other times of the year, immediately after
the communion, and at new year's day, they distribute to
