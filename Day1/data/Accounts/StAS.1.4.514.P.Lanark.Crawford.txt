fences on what was formerly called the town fo Crawford,
than there are in all the parish besides.  One of my neigh-
bours has been at considerable expense, not only in inclo-
sing his freedom, and building a house, but in improving
his ground, and planting trees.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-With respect to the common
people in this parish, and indeed, in all the parishes round
me, I observe a sobriety or regard to moral conduct, which,
I hope, proceeds from religious principle.  The herds and
their wives, who live at too great a distance from the pu-
blic school to send their children thither, are careful to
teach them not only to read the Bible, but to get psalms by
heart, etc.  There may be instances of petty thefts, but
great or daring ones are very rare.  The greatest nuisances
to which are exposed, are strolling beggars, who go a-
bout the country, more especially at the time of shearing
the sheep, and men in trowsers who pretend to be sailors in
distress.-The prevailing distempers or ailments in this
place, are the rheumatism and the scurvy.  The humidity
of our air is sufficient to account for the former, and I as-
cribe the latter to the manner of living.  Salt mutton and 
beef constitute a principle article of food.  The people in
general are extremely fond of them, and at the same time
are averse to vegetables.  In the mid-land parts of the
county of Banss, where I was born, flesh made seldom a
part of the ordinary diet of the common people; when it
was used, it was eaten indeed without vegetables, but it was
always eaten in a manner fresh.  Both rheumatisms and
scurvy were much less frequently subjects of complaint
there than here.-The ancient state of this parish furnishes
perhaps as much subject for speculation as the present.  We
have 2 Roman roads, and no less than the sites of 3 camps,
