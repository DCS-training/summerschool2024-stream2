			PARISH OF LUMPHANAN.

	PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE O'NEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

		THE REV. CHARLES M'COMBIE, MINISTER.

                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
         Name.-THE etymology of Lumphanan, which is spelled in the
most ancient writings, Lunfanan, Lonfanan, and Lanfanan can-
not be ascertained with certainty. We may conjecture that it
comes from three Celtic words, Llan or Lan, a church-Fan, a
descent-and An, water, *-a derivation which might naturally sug-
gest itself to those who observed that the principal stream in the
parish passes near the church, in its descent frol the mountains to
the Loch of Auchlossan.
         Situation, Extent, and Boundaries.-The parish is situate be-
tween the Dee and the Don, in the district of Mar, twenty-four
miles from Aberdeen.
	The length of the parish from north to south is 6 miles; the
breadth from east to west, 4 miles.
	It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Tough, Leochel,
and Coull ; on the south by Kincardine O'Neil and Aboyne; on the
east bv Kincardine o'Neil; and on the west by Coull and Aboyne.
         Geology.-The rocks of the parish are of the primitive order,
formed chiefly of porphyritic granite and granite.
         Zoology.-Besides the domesticated races, the following animals
reside during the whole, or a part of the year, in the parish, or
occasionally visit it.
