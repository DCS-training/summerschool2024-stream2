compounded of two words, viz. Cul and Ross; the first,
Cul, signifying back, or, more properly, what is expressed by

Frith of Forth.  The barony of Kincardine, contiguous there-

parish is 4 miles from E. to W. and about the same from
N. to S. making nearly a regular square, and containing
8145; acres, Scotch measure.  Of these, nearly one third
to the N. and W. consist chiefly of marsh and muir,
