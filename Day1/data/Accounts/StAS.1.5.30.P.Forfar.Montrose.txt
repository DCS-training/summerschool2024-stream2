     Statistical Account

much among all ranks, especially the vulgar.  When severs
occur, they are almost constantly of the nervous tribe.  Eve-
ry malady proceeding from a relaxed state of the fibres
prevails here.  This relaxation is occasioned, by our at-
mosphere being replete with marine vapours, and a copious
mephitic exhalation, emitted from the bason, when the
water retires.  From this account, putrid diseases might
be supposed to be among our endemics, but they are not.
The true putrid sore-throat is a rare distemper here; and
our nervous severs, unless neglected, or improperly treated,
rarely assume the putrid diathesis.  The humidity of our
atmosphere is probably corrected by a considerable mix-
ture of saline particles.-The water is excellent, and to be
had in abundance.  It is conveyed about 3 miles in pipes
of lead, and issues from wells in different parts of the
town.

   Antiquities.-Among the few antiquities, which Montrose
can boast of, the Fort hill, which takes its name from the
castle, built on its summit, deserves to be particularly men-
tioned.  From its position, it was well adapted to command
the town, the harbour, and the shipping in the river.  The
main current of the river probably flowed, in former times,
on the other side of the island of Inchbrayock, and it has
evidently made very considerable encroachments on this
hill.  A well was discovered a few years ago on the brink,
and, when the water is clear and smooth, another has been
seen a good way into the river.  Both of them, in all pro-
bability, have been once within the sort.  The inhabitants
remember, that the river at the Fort hill was not near so
deep, nor so broad, as at present.  Tradition says, that in an-
cient times, persons on the opposite banks could almost
shake hands.  Another memorable and valuable piece of
