that division of it which belongs to Kinnettles, which are
planted.  There are a few acres of woodland on the Brig-
ton side.  The hill continues to descend to the 5. within
a small distance from a rivulet which runs through the
southern district of the parish.  The western descent con-
tains 4 inclosures, and then dies away into flat land.
The northern continues the length of 3 inclosures; after-
ward the land is rather level, comprehending 3 inclosures
also.  There is a like number on the eastern descent,
which is divided into two parts.  South of the rivulet a
range of sloping banks declines to the N. as far as the ri-

particularly in oats after ley, when it is well laid down.
Even the light soil has produced good crops with marl and
kindly treatment.-The air is not so much infested with
fogs as in some other districts in Scotland, being rather dry
and healthful.  We have no diseases that can be said to be

melancholy habits are equally rare here as in most other
districts.  The most epidemical fever in my remembrance,
was about the beginning of spring 1789, after an uncom-
monly wet winter, in a village low and wet.  Our air is
sharp in winter, and frosty in proportion as the Grampians
are covered with snow.  We have several freestone quar-
