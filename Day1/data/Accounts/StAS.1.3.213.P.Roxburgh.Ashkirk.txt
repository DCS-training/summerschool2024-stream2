     Situation, Extent, and Surface.

   THIS parish lies in the counties of Roxburgh and Sel-
kirk; the greater part of it, however, is in that of Rox-
burgh.  It is in the presbytery of Selkirk, and synod of
Merse and Teviotdale.  The parish is of a square form,
about seven English miles long, and three broad.  This pa-
rish may be called hilly, but most of the hills are free from
heath to their very tops.  The soil in general is light, and in
several parts spongy.

   River and Lakes.-There is only one river in the parish,
which runs through it from west to east; it is called Ale.
Thereb are four lakes within, and eight partly without the bounds
of the parish, none of them above a mile in circumference,
all which discharge their waters into the river Ale.  This
river abounds with trout.  The lakes produce large trout,
perch, and pike in considerable numbers.

   Horses and Black Cattle.-The number of horses is about
140, and that of black cattle about 442.  About 92 calves
