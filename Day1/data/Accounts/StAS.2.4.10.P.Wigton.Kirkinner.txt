church to Sir Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch, and this grant was ra-
tified by Parliament in June 1592."
  Kirkinner now consists of the united parishes of Kirkinner and
Longcastle.  Longcaster or Longcastle parish obtained its name
from an ancient castle, the ruins of which are still extant on a
smell island in a lake called Longcastle Loch.  The name ap-
pears to have been written Longcaster, at the epoch of the Refor-
mation.  The church was then a rectory.  Longcastle continued
to be a separate parish in 1630, but, being of small extent, it was
annexed to the adjacent parish of Kirkinner about the middle of
the seventeenth century.  It forms the south-west corner of the
united parish.
  Extent and Boundaries.--The mean length of the parish is about
5 miles; its mean breadth about 4 1/2; it contains nearly 24 square
miles.   It is bounded on the north and north-west, by the parishes
of Wigton, Penningham, and Kirkcowan; on the west, by Moch-
rum; on the south-west, by Glasserton; on the south, by Sorbie;
on the east and north east, by the Bay of Wigton.  It may be com-
pared to a section of a pyramid, the base running nearly from north
to south, and the top lying along the bay of Wigton.
  Topographical Appearance.--In appearance, the country is
hilly, but cannot be termed mountainous.  With the exception of
what are called the low lands, the greater part of the parish con-
sists of gently swelling little hills, which, covered with rich vendure,
or crowned with plantation, give a pleasing variety to the prospect.
Standing on the top of one of these elevations, you may count a
dozen others, all rising around; but none of them are of great
height above the level of the sea.
  The extent of coast along the bay of Wigton is about 3 miles;
the shore is flat, of a deep clay soil.
  Meteorology.--Temperature of the atmosphere for the last two
years and a half, taken at Low Balfern, nearly on a level with the
bay of Wigton.  The calculations are made twice a day, in summer
at five o'clock in the morning, in winter at sunrise, and every day
at two o'clock afternoon.
