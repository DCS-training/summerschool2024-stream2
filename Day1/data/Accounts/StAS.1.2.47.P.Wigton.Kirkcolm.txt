     of Kirkholm.

-Beyond a small point of land, called the Star, there is 
a fine bank of most excellent oysters, small indeed, but highly
flavoured, and of a most delicious taste.  It is believed, that
if persons, skilled in managing dredge-nets, were to ply in
deep water, oysters would be got in greater numbers, and of
a larger size, than by the present mode of taking them off the
beach, with the hand, when the tide is out;  and, instead of
being stinted to a day or two about the new or the full moon,
they might dredge for them at all times with success.-
In regard to fresh waters, in so narrow a peninsula, any large
stream cannot be expected; and accordingly there is but
one small rivulet, which very scantily supplies water suf-
ficient to serve a corn miln, the only one in the parish.

   Surface, Crops, etc.-The surface of the parish is rather plain
and level, than hilly, and the rising grounds have so easy and gen-
tle on ascent, that they may be, and actually are, cultivated
with the plow even to the very summit.  The soil is various.
Round the shore it is thin, sandy, or gravellish; in the more
inland parts, it is in some places a rich loam, in others a deep
clay; and in others, a mixture all these soils.
   The crops principally raised are oats and barley, or bear,
with rye grass and clover.  They have not yet engaged in the
culture of field turnips or cabbages.  Small quantities of grey
pease, and smaller quantities of horse beans are sown by some 
for their own private use, but none for sale; and much the 
same may be said in regard to wheat.  The spirit of improv-
ing land began some years ago; but it was confined to a few
individuals, proprietors of the land they cultivated.  The
common tenants thought such operations were too expensive
for them to embark in; but now that spirit has diffused itself
greatly, and, indeed, almost universally, among farmers of
all descriptions.
