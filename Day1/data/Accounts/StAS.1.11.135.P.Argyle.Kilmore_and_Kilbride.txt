   Improvement of the Village.-This village arose from a very
small beginning.  Till the custom-house was built, it consist-
ed of only 2 or 3 houses of mean appearance.  But after the
custom-house was erected, and some trade began to arise, from
the convenient situation of the bay, lying near the Western
Ocean, and in the vicinity of a populous country, the at-
tention of the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Campbell of Dunstaff-

prosperity of Oban.  They came to the place in 1778, in the
line of plain tradesmen; and, by their genius and ability,
displayed in various branches of traffic, they have greatly im-
proved their own fortunes, while they have at the same time
promoted the good of the country at large: Oban, in parti-
cular, may look on them as its founders; for the elder bro-
ther commenced, and succesively keeps up the business of
ship-building; a branch never attempted to any extent before
in this country.  And the younger brother employs also

environs are singularly indebted to them.

   Character of the People.-The change in the circumstances,
the appearance, and the morals of the people of the lower
class, in this parish, has been considerable, since the present

villages, of tolerable black farm-houses, were almost wholly
