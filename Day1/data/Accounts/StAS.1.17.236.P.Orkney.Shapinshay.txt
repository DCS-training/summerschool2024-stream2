the most remarkable pieces of antiquity in this, and indeed
in the other islands, are those large ruins commonly deno-
minated Pict houses.  Here they are frequently met with a-
long the sea shore, two or three of them at no great distance
from, and in general raising their conical heads in view of
each other.  They are situated, for the most part, on the
most pleasant spots; they are covered with green, and orna-
mented with flowers and herbs of various sorts; and such of
them as have been examined by the eye of curiosity, have
discovered considerable variety in both their form and di-
mensions.  Most of them are circular; some of them verging
towards an oval shape; some of them are very large, others
of a smaller size; in general they are built without cement,
in some few instances with it; and, from the remains of the
most entire of them, it would appear that they are wide at
the foundation, and are contracted as they advance upwards,
somewhat in the form of a kiln, and that they were closed
or covered at the top is probable.  The inside of such of
them as we have seen, however, is divided into a great num-
ber of apartments, many of which seem to be of a very
whimsical and inconvenient form, and all of them are so

when each of the islands, especially of the larger kind, was
a state within itself, governed by its own prince or its own
chieftain, these buildings might have been erected as forts to
