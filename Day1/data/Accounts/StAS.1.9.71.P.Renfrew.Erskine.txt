   The excess of the population above the usual proportion
of births and burials is probably to be accounted for chief-
ly from this circumstance: The greatest part of the ser-
vants in the parish come from Argyleshire, between the
ages of 14 and 20.  Many of these, after remaining a few
years, leave the parish, and are replaced by others.  As
they have commonly got over the childrens diseases before
they come here, and are remarkably healthy, very few of
them die during their residence in the parish.  They there-
fore increase the population, without at all increasing the
number of baptisms, or sensibly increasing the number
of burials. If to 650, the product of 25 by 26, there be
added 127, the number of servants, the sum 777 probably
exceeds the mean population, for the period for which the
average is taken.

oat-meal, and L. 25:  18:  2 10/12 Sterling of money, including

sides L. 1 Sterling as session-clerk, and 10 s. for teaching

teaching reading 1 s. 6 d. the quarter, and 2 s. for writing
and arithmetic.  The average number of scholars is 30.-
The annual amount of the various branches of the fund for
the relief of the poor, on an average of 10 years, including
the interest of L. 120 of accumulated stock, is L. 27, 6 s.
At present 9 persons, including a foundling boy, receive
regular pensions, and 3 or 4 receive occasional supplies.
