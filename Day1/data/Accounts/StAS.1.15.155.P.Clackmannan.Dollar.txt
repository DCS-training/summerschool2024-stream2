     NUMBER X.

     PARISH OF DOLLAR,

     (COUNTY OF CLAOKMANNAN, PRESBYTERY OF STIRLING,
     SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN WATSON, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE word DOLLAR is said to be Gaelic.  According to some
it was formerly spelt Dollard, from doll, a plain, or vale, and
ard, a hill, or high land. This is perfectly applicable to its
real situation, the principal part of the parish being a beauti-
ful plain or valley, of about an English mile.  in breadth, lying
along the foot of a high range of hills, known by the name of
the Ochil-Hills. According to others, it may be expressed Doil-
lar, signifying a hidden or concealed place.  This also is
expressive of its real situation; which is low and not seen at
any great distance, when one approaches it in any direction.

   Situation, Extent, Form, and Appearance.-It is supposed to
be equally distant from Stirling, Kinross, and Dumfermline;
and is reckoned about 12 English miles from each.  The
