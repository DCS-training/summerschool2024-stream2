   The steam-boat has contributed much to the accommodation of
passengers in calm weather and cross winds; the boats, instead of
being long on their passage as they formerly were, being taken in
tow by the Queen Margaret, are scarcely twenty minutes in pas-
sing. There are two porters at each side paid by the trustees. The
boats are manned by experienced seamen, well acquainted with the
navigation, generally regular in their habits, and polite in their at-
tention to passengers. No loss of a boat has occurred for more
than sixty years; and this may be considered one of the best re-
gulated ferries in the kingdom. In October 1838, a most melan-
choly accident occurred at the Newhalls Pier, owing to the very
reprehensible practice of driving the coaches to the water's edge
along the piers, to receive passengers from the boats. A young
lady and a female servant were precipitated with the coach, into
which they had just entered, into the water, and drowned before
they could be extricated. The mother of the lady and a gentle-
man had nearly shared the same fate. Since that fatal day, which
will not be speedily forgotten, the practice of driving on the pier
has been abandoned. Two or three times in the year the boats
may be prevented from crossing by stormy weather or contra-
ry winds, but this very rarely extends to a few hours. At the
present time, 1831, the rental of the passage is L. 1840 per an-
num; the tacksmen engaging to keep up the boats and pay the
wages of the men.
   The harbour of Queensferry was once in a very ruinous condi-
tion, but is now in a very excellent state of repair. The funds for
making the recent improvements were raised by a contribution of
L. 600 from the convention of royal burghs; L. 200 from the two
noble families in the neighbourhood; and the remaining L. 800
from the funds of the burgh, arising from the sale of the Ferry
muir to Dundas of Dundas for L. 1610. In winter, when the her-
ring-fishery is prosperous, the harbour is often crowded with ves-
