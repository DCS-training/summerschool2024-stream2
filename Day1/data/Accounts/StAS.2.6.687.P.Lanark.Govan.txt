   Previous to the year 1825, the, College of Glasgow for more
than a century enjoyed, by successive renewals from the Crown,
a beneficial lease of these and other rents and revenues, which for-
merly belonged to the Archbishopric of Glasgow.  Since then
the lease has not been renewed.  But in lieu of it, on the 7th of
August 1826, His Majesty George IV. was pleased to grant, to
the College an annuity L.800 for fourteen years. *  The teinds
of the parish, which are the property of the College, subject to
the payment of the minister's stipend, are nearly all valued. These
amount annually to about L.940.
   Parochial Registers.-The records of the kirk-session contain
an uninterrupted history of its proceedings from January 15, 1710.
Some years ago, an old volume was discovered, and restored to the
session, by the descendants of a former elder of the parish.  It
commences with the 15th of May 1651, and ends with the llth
of May 1662. The date of the earliest entry in the register of
baptisms and marriages is July 2, 1690.  In the year 1729, in
place of the baptisms, the births of children were, for the first
time, recorded.  Since the year 1817, a list of the interments in
the parish churchyard has been kept. +
   Hospital of Polmadie.-Persons of both sexes were admitted
into this asylum, which was dedicated to St John, and maintained
in it during life.  The church and temporalities of Strathblane
were annexed to it, along with a part of the lands of Little Govan. ++
The privileges of the hospital were confirmed by Alexander III.,
and afterward by Robert Bruce, at Rutherglen, in the eleventh
year of his reign; and in 1333, a charter of exemption was grant-
ed by the Earl of Lennox. S  Patrick de Floker was made master
the brothers and sisters, and pensioners of the hospital of Pol-
Madie, in 1316, by Robert Wisehart, Bishop of Glasgow, who

          It will be seen from the following minute in the session records of this parish,
that the compulsory plan of education adopted in Prussia is not altogether an origi-
nal system.  "The samen day (June 26, 1653) the session does ordain that everie
elder in their severall qrters do search who have children able and fit to come to
schoole, and does not send them, to deall wt them for that effect, and to signifie that
if they prove deficient hereinto, according to an old act of session, they will be oblidg-
ed to pay their qrter, as well as if they came to this schooll."
