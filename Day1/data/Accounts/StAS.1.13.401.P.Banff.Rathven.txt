prietors of 4 floops  of 18, 25, 30, and 36 tons, and 2 of 60
tons burden, navigated by 26 seamen.
   2. Porteasy is situated at he distance of fearce 2 miles
from Buckie.  It became a fishing station in 1727, when
5 houses were built by the proprietor of Rannes for the
accommodation of the original fishers from Findhorn.  This
information was obtained from a man aged 90, still alive,
and a native of this parish, who helped to man the first boat.
At present this fisher-town contains 44 houses, and 178 in-
habitants; and of these 84 are males, and 94 females:
They have 5 large and 7 small boats.  At the commence-
ment of this station, Buckie had 5 boats, Findochtie 3, and
Portnocki 5.
   3. Findochtie lies at the distance of 2 miles from the for-
mer station, and has 45 houses, and 162 inhabitants; 74
males and 88 females.  It was settled in 1716 by fishers
from Frasersburgh, according to the information of a wo-
man aged 91, who was married to one of the original fish-
ers in 1721.  Portnockie, of which she is a native, at the
time of her removal, had 3 boats.  There are at present 4
large, and 6 small boats in Findochtie.
   4. Portnockie is at the distance of 2 miles from Findoch-
tie.  The following anecdote ascertains its origin as fish-
ing station:  About 20 years ago died Kattie Slater, aged
96.  Like many old people she was unable to tell her age
precisely; but she recollected that she was as old as the
house of Farskane, as her father had often told her that he
built the first house in Portnockie the same year in which
the house of Farskane was built, and that she was brought
from Cullen to it, and rocked in fisher's scull instead of a
cradle.  Now by the date on the house of Farskane, it ap-
pears to have been built in 1677.  Thus the origin of
Portnockie is fixed with sufficient accuracy.  At present
