L.8, 6s. 8d. allowed for communion elements.
   The great bulk of the population in this parish are members of
the Established Church; and their attendance both at the parish
church and at the chapel of Macduff is in general regular and
punctual, when the weather and roads permit.
   The following is the account taken by the two ministers for a
census in 1837:

   Three or four families, in the southwest of the parish, attend
the church of King-Edward, which is much nearer them; and a
few on the borders of King-Edward parish, farther east, attend
the church of Gamrie for the same reason. The sacrament of
the Lord's Supper is dispensed once a-year at both churches,
with generally upwards of 700 communicants each. The young
are admitted to communion for the first time, after careful instruc-
tions and examinations by the ministers for months previous, and
strict inquiry into their moral and religious character. The Crown
is the sole patron of the parish, and the Earl of Fife's Trustees
appoint the minister of Macduff, and pay him a salary of L.80,
which they have raised to L.100 for some years past; but, as
they will give no bond for his stipend, he has not been admitted
to the ranj of a quoad sacra minister, although ordained to the
pastoral office. The Rev. Thomas Wilson is the third of his fa-
mily, in a direct line, who has held the office of parish minister
of Gamrie. His grandfather was ordained to that charge in 1732.
   Education.-There are two parochial schools in the parish;
one at Gamrie, and the other at Macduff; each has the salary
settled by law in such cases, of L.25, 13s. 3rd. with a shared of
the Dick Bequest. The amount of fees average at Macduff about
L.50, and at Gamrie, L.25. The schoolmaster of Gamrie's
other emoluments, as session-clerk, amount to L.12, making his
living altogether about L.90, with a house and small garden, the
rent of which is paid gratuitously by Mr Garden of Troup, as
