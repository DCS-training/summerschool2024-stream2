   Rivers and Fish.-The river Jed runs along the W. bound-
ary 2 miles.  Oxnam water has its source about 2 miles
from the S. end of the parish, runs N. by Oxnam, and, after
a course of 11 3/4 miles, wherein there are many beautiful ser-
pentine windings, falls into Tiviot below Crailing.  Both the
Coquet and the Kail, arise in that lofty ridge of mountains,
lying in a direction betwixt N. and E., which separates Scot-
land and England from each other.  The Coquet bounds the
parish for a mile on the S., the only point in which it touches
Scotland; and, after receiving a vast number of smaller streams,
precipitating themselves from the mountains, quickly swells
into a considerable river, which takes an easterly direction
through Northumberland, and discharges itself into the British
Ocean, betwixt Alnwick and Coquet Isle.  The Kail, after
running the breadth of the parish in a N. E. direction, takes
its course, of 16 1/2 miles, by Hownam, Morebattle, and Marle-
field, and joins the Tiviot a little below Eckford kirk.  These
all abound in trout of an excellent quality, though, in point
of quantity, the Coquet is the most distinguished.  Besides, it
affords a salmon fishery, many of which spawn about 4 or 5
miles from its head.

   Minerals and Mineral Springs.-Attempts have been made
to find coal in this parish, as well as in the neighbourhood,
but without success.  Limestone was found on the W. side of
the parish, by Jed; but, being under a deep cover, and at a
great distance from coal, the advantage of burning it is very
doubtful.  There is a chalybeate spring near Fairloans, on the
S. end of the parish, to which qualities similar to Gillsland
water are ascribed; but little of it has ever been used.

   Perennial and Migratory Birds.-Game abounds here;
amongst which may be reckoned the beautiful black-cock and
