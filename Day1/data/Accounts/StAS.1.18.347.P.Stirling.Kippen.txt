that month approaches, before the fields are dry enough for
the plough.  In the year 1789, the bear-seed was not finish-
ed before the 8th June.  So late a season however was ra-
ther uncommon.  Harvest is seldom over before the middle
or end of October, and corn is seen sometimes standing out
even when the month of November is advanced.  On account
of the frequent rains, it is but seldom that any labour can be
got forward after harvest, or during the winter.  The same
circumstance is also unfavourable to the practice of fallowing,
which however is neglected in this country, more than is
proper.  It is indeed seldom or never attempted in the dry-
field, and in the carse but sometimes, as a preparation for
sowing wheat.
   The soil of the carse has been already described.  In the
carse farms, the infield or crosting grounds were formerly
kept in a constant rotation of barley, oats, and beans.  A
great part of the infield carse lands has been laboured in this
way for time immemorial, without ever being pastured or
summer fallowed.  The outfield was sown with three crops
of oats successively, and then pastured.  Carting clay from
the ditches and ends of ridges, and mixing it with dung and
moss, was thought to make excellent manure, though pro-
cured with great labour.  This compost however is less
used, and more lime is laid upon the grounds, since the prac-
tice of summer fallowing and sowing grass-seeds was intro-
duced.  This is found to possess great advantages over the
former mode of culture.
   The whole dryfield of this parish lies upon a rock, which
is immediately covered with a bed of till, and above this is
the soil, which is of unequal depth, though generally shallow.
Hence it is generally wet, as the water is not allowed to sub-
side.  The soil immediately contiguous to the moor is mossy
and poor, but it becomes richer farther down the hill.  The
