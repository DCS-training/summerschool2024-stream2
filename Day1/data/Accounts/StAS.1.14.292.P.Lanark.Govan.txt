Britons and as Christians, of their utter abhorrence of
the wanton impiety and facrilegious effrontry, which are
become the predominant features of the French nation,
and which their Convention's extravagant changes in the
computation of time, will only more effectually expose
to the honest indignation of prosterity.
   The stipend since 1762, when it received a small ad-
dition, has been 2 chalders of bear, 2 of meal, and 500 L.
Scotch.  The court of teinds last year, augmented it to
4 chalders of bear, 4 of meal, and 600 L.  Scotch, inclu-
ding allowance for communion elements.  The glebe and
grass-ground consist of 7 acres, and upwards.  The pa-
tronage of the parish belongs to the College of Glasgow.
The mance, and a complete court of offices, are entirely
new:  They cost near 500 L.  Sterling; and the readiness
with which the heritors agreed to assess themselves in so
considerable a sum, stands unexampled, perhaps, in most 
places of Scotland.

   School.-Besides the parochial school, which is kept in
the village of Govan, by the same person who holds the 
office of session-clerk, there are 4 private schools in the
parish.  The parochial schoolmaster has no dwelling-
house from the heritors, but lately obtained from them
a salary of 200 merks Scotch.  With this, his different
emoluments, of which the most confiderable arises from
a mortification made in 1757, by Abraham Hill, a native
of the parish, for the education of 10 poor children, a-
mount, exclusive of school fees, to little less than 40l.
Sterling a-year.

   Poor.-There are, at present, upon the parish roll 2x
poor people, who are supported by the voluntary col-
lections at the church doors, and the interest of 420 L.
