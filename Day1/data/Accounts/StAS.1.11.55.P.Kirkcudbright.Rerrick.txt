   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 22 heritors in the parish.

winter, there are fed in the fields, with hay and straw, no less than 2150 black
cattle; now, if the dung of these were carefully collected, might it not con-
tribute greatly to increase our quantity of wheat, and enlarge our fields of green
crops!
