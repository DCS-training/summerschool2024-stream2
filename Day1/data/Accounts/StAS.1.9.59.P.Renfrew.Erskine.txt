     of Erskine.

the parish is oblong; the length from east to west, and a
little north, is about 6 English miles, and the breadth
from 3 to 4; the number of acres which it contains is not
known.  It is bounded on the north wholly by the river
Clyde.

   Surface and Soil.-The general appearance of the east-
ern part of the parish is flat, with gentle swells.  A ridge
of hilly ground runs through the western division.  As this
however declines gradually on the north side towards the
Clyde, and on the south towards a valley, there are even
in that division considerable tracts of arable ground.  The
soil is in general light and not deep.  In the north-east
part of the parish, it is a blackish or dark grey mould, mix-
ed with gravel, having under it gravel, or a mixture of
sand, clay, and gravel ; in some places till, and under that
rotten rock or freestone.  From this structure, that tract a-
bounds with springs of excellent water.  The soil being
warm and dry, is well adapted for producing oats, bear,
and sown grasses ; it also yields plentiful crops of potatoes
of the best quality, and of turnips.  It is not so proper for
wheat and pease ; and even the oats and barley which it
produces ar somewhat inferior in quality, or weigh less to
the measure than what are produced in stronger and deeper
soils.  But perhaps the most valuable property of this soil
is the disposition it has to run to grass.  When it is allow-
ed to rest, if it has been judiciously managed, and not over-
cropped, it in a year or two becomes covered with a thick
sward of grass, often mixed with white clover, which,
though not of the richest quality, is abundant, and conti-
nually improves during the 4 to 5 years that the ground re-
mains in pasture.  The same things may be observed of
the western division of the parish ; only as that is more
hilly, the soil is more shallow and stony, and in general
