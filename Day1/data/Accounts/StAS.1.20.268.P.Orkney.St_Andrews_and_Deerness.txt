L. 4931: 15: 0 1/4 Scots.  And the real rent, as appears from
a rental given in to the Court of Session in the year 1772, is
21 1/2 barrels 50 lispunds and 7 1/3 merks of butter, 938 meils 3
settings and 19 merks of malt, 35 meils 3 settings and 18
merks of oat-meal, and L. 1312: 6: 10 5/6 Scots in money.
The whole, at a moderate conversion, amounting to L. 5826,
6 s. 11 2/3 d, Scots, or L. 485: 10: 7 Sterling.  The yearly
value of the great and small teinds may be about L. 100
Sterling, out of which the minister's stipend is paid.  The
lands in these parishes pay a very high superior duty; so

   Price of Provisions.-When Brand wrote his description
of Orkney, about the beginning of this century, a cow was
sold for L. 4 or L. 5 Scots; a sheep, for 14 s. Scots; a calf,

horse, for L. 4 or L. 5 Sterling; a goose, for 8 d.; a hen, for
3 d.; and eggs, at 2 d. per dozen.  Now, cows are sold at
from L. 3 to L. 4 Sterling; sheep, for 6 s.; Lambs, or calves,
for 2 s. 6 d. each.  Butter, 7d. per lib.; an ox, L. 5, 10 s.;
a horse, L. 12; a goose, 1 s. 6 d.; a hen, 6 d.; and eggs, 3 d.
