   Antiquities.-There is an old ruin, called Foulden, which
appears to have been a place of security and strength, in the
times of the Border contests.  There is also a property, called
Nunlands, where there was an establishment of nuns in former
times; but no record or tradition has been met with, that gives
any history of either+.

   Markets and Roads.-There are 2 fairs held annually in the
village; but little or no business is done at them.  A very
few cattle appear sometimes for sale, and a small quantity of
wool.  Formerly, great quantities of shoes were sold at the
fairs here, and were bought by the people in Northumber-
land.-The roads in this neighbourhood have lately under-
gone a great repair, in consequence of several turnpikes hav-
ing been erected.

*The present incumbent succeeded Mr JOHN BUCHANAN, whose predeces-
sor, Mr ROBERT PARK, was the first Presbyterian minister of this parish after
the Revolution in 1688; the Episcopal clergyman having continued in the
charge about eleven years after Presbyterian church-government was establishe
in Scotland.

+There was also a fortified wall on the east end of the village of Foulden,
the remains of which were taken down some years ago.  The chief design of
it seems to have been, for a defence to the residence of LORD ROSS, who took
an active part in the wars between England and Scotland, and who was proprie-
tor of the estate of Foulden in those days.
