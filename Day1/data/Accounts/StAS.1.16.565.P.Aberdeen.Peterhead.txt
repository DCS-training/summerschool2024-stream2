     of Peterhead.

   There was alive in 1790, and she is not yet dead, a poor
woman, who declared she was then 105 years old, and a
few days ago told me she was now 109 years of age.  This
declaration appears to be sufficiently authenticated from
answers she gives to questions respecting past events, and
other collateral circumstances.  She is by no means de-
crepit, as one might naturally expect; she still continues
to travel through the country as a beggar, and says, the
only uneasiness she feels, is a small degree of weariness from
carrying her meal bag, which is generally pretty full.  She
has the appearance of being only betwixt 70 and 80 years
of age.  When the last list of the inhabitants of the town
of Peterhead in 1790 was taken, there were two persons
from 90 to 95 years of age, one person of 87, one of 86,
two of 85, and 21 from 80 to 85.  In the same list the
females exceed the males 336; that is, they are nearly as
13 1/4 to 10.  The number of houses was about 500.
   The population in the country part of the parish in 1794
was as follows:

Total in the country,  1141

   In the sea-town of Boddom, always considered as part of
the country, there were, females 106, males 86, total 192.
Families in the country 259; of which, in the sea-town of
Boddom there were 49.  From the rapid progress of ma-
nufactures in the town of Peterhead since 1790, I suppose
there is at present in the whole parish about 4100.

   Dr Webster's account in 1755 questionable.-I find in Dr
Webster's report in 1755, the inhabitants of this parish are
reckoned to be 2487.  I have great doubts of this being
accurate, and therefore have not stated it in my account of
