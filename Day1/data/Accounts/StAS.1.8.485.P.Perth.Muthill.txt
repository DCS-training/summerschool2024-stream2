     NUMBER XXIX.

     PARISH OF MUTHIL.

     (County of Perth-Presbytery of Auchterarder-Synod of
     Perth and Stirling.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN SCOTT, Minister.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   MUTHIL is situated on the borders of the Highlands;
and as the names of almost all the places around are
Gaelic, and generally descriptive of their local situation, it pro-
bably takes its name from an Erse word, of somewhat a simi-
lar sound, which signifies the north side of the hill.-The pa-
rish is of an irregular shape, but one of the most populous of
the whole country; and is of great extent, being from 8 to 10
miles in length, and from 6 to 9 in breadth.-The village,
where the kirk stands, which gives its name to the parish, is up-
on the great military road, leading to Inverness by Tay Bridge.
It is 4 miles south from Crief, 17 from Stirling, and nearly
the same distance from Perth.  Before the Reformation, it
was the residence of the Dean of Dumblane, and in after times,
the seat of a presbytery, which now meets at Auchterarder,
being more in the center of the district.
