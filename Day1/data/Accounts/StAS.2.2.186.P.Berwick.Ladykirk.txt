ber of communicants at the Established church, for the last five
years is 170 for the five years preceding, 160. The average
amount of the church collections is from L. 5 to L. 6 per an-
num, the greater part of which is expended in the payment of
church officers.
   Education.-There is only one school in the parish, viz. the
parochial school, where Greek, Latin, French, and the more usual
branches of education, are taught. The salary of the schoolmaster,
unfortunately, is the minimum, amounting to L. 25, 13s. 3 1/2d.; the
school fees average about the same sum, to which may be added
L. 15 arising from other sources. The rate of school fees was
fixed by the heritors in 1817, and is the same as in the neighbour-
ing parishes. There are four or five persons upwards of 6 years
of age who cannot read; none, upwards of 15.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons re-
ceiving parochial aid, for the last five years, is 18, and the average
sum allotted to each is 2s. per week, which, together with occa-
sional supplies amounts to about L. 100 per annum. This is de-
rived from a cess paid by the heritors and tenants. There ap-
pears to be little or no feeling of degradation among the poor in
soliciting parochial aid: nearly all apply as soon as they think it
will be granted.
   Fairs.-There is a fair held on the 5th of April, where linen
and lintseed are the principal articles of sale.
   Alehouses.-There are three alehouses in the parish; two would
be amply sufficient; but the people being generally of sober habits.
any evil effects from them are scarcely perceptible.
   Fuel.-Coal is the only description of fuel used in the parish;
it is brought from North Durham, five miles distant, and is pur-
chased at the rate of 7s. a ton at the coal-pit.
