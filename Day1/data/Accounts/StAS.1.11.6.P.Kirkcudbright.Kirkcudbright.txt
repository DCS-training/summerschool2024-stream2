   The species of grain, that is sown in the parish, consist of
bear, barley, and oats, chiefly the latter.  They are all very
good, though not so weighty as what is produced upon deeper
foils.  Although wheat is but little cultivated in this part of
the country, it is however the opinion of the most experienced
farmers, that the soil is equal to the production of any kind
of grain; being, though light and thin, exceedingly gracious.
For manuring the land, marle is here chiefly used.  It is found
more or less scattered over the whole parish, in beds, from 22
feet thick to 3 inches, and at various depths below the sur-
face.  Lime too is brought from Whitehaven, and employed
by some farmers for meliorating their land.  But besides
marle, which is found within the parish, there is also an inex-
haustible store of shells lying along the coast, which are prin-
cipally used for enriching the-grounds that lie contiguous
to it.
