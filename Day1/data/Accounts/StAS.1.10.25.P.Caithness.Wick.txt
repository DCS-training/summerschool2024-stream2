never preserved here.-The experiment of boiling the flax,
instead of watering it, seemed to answer in this parish.

   Fuel.-As to fuel, some parts of the parish abound with
moss grounds, which furnish the contiguous farmers with
plenty of peats.  Other places, particularly the town of Wick,
lie two or three miles distant from moss.  Providing this
article of peats takes up the farmer during the greater part
of the summer season, and, in bad years, a part of the harvest
also; and yet in a wet season, many are very ill supplied.
This mode of getting fuel proves very hurtful to husbandry,
as a farmer could much more profitably employ his carts in
making dunghills for his lands; a garron load of peats on
crubans is sold in Wick, at a penny.  Each horse carries on-
ly about ten or twelve peats.  Ten or twelve of these loads
will scarcely fill an ordinary cart.  To the poor tenant mak-
ing peats is an unprofitable occupation, and to the buyer
they are undoubtedly dear.  The burgh is so sensible of this
inconvenience, that they and the neighbourhood are coming
more and more into the practice of burning coals.  But
Caithness and the other northern counties labour under a
grievous burden, that most unreasonable duty on coals water-
born, which, however, there is now a prospect of soon being
freed from.

   Crops.-Very little land is here employed in raising artifi-
cial or sown grasses, but there is a good deal of common
meadow grass.  Mr Dunbar of Hempriggs has from 12 to
14 acres under clover and rye-grass, though winter herding
has not yet been fully established.  There are a few acres of
sown grass in the open fields between Wick and Staxigoe,
and about eight acres more in the possession of the minister.
Few deal in green crops.  A small quantity of turnips may
