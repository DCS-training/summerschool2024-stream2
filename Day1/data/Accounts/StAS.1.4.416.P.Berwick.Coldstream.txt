     Manufactures.-There is no town in the south of Scotland
so well situated for manufactures, in my humble opinion, as
Goldstream.  The country in its neighbourhood, on both
banks of the Tweed is rich in corn and cattle.  The price
of coals is moderate.  We are distant from Berwick about
15 miles.  The great road between London and Berwick,
the road between Berwick and Kelso, and between Dunfe
and Northumberland, all pass through the town of Cold-
stream.  Goods manufactured here might be thus carried in
various directions into England and Scotland, by ways of
communication already opened up.  Should the projected
plan of a canal be executed and carried near this place, the
price of coals would be reduced, and all the advantages
would be reaped, which arise from an inland navigation.
From the excellent nature of the soil, flax might be raised to
serve the purpose of a linen manufacture.  The good qua-
lity of our barley would favour a distillery or a brewery;
neither of which we at present have.  Our ale, beer, and
porter, come from Ednam.  But the woollen manufacture is
that for which Coldstream is particularly well situated.
The breed of sheep is excellent, and is still improving.  I
am not sure if the wool, by which the trade and manufac-
tures of Leeds have risen to such vast importance, be in ge-
neral equal to what is produced in the Merse, Tiviotdale and
Northumberland.  Yetham, Galashiels, Hawick, places far
distant from coals, and not enjoying our advantages of com-
munication,are pushing the woollen manufacture with suc-
cess.  Were a proper plan set on foot here for carrying on
