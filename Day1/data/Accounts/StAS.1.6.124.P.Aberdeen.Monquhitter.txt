   Population.-In 1755, the return to Dr Webster from this
parish was 997 inhabitants.  In 1757, the number of souls
fell short of 800; but, since that time, population has rapidly
increased, partly by the practice of dividing large farms in or-
der to accommodate small tenants, but principally by the esta-
blishment of Cuminestown village, in 1763.

dread by the older and weaker class of country people.
