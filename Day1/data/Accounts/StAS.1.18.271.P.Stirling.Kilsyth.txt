   I have been more particular in the above extract, be-
cause I think it one of the most important articles in a statis-
tical account; and because the registers of this parish have
been kept with uncommon care.
   Therefore, as it may be depended upon as correct it may
serve many useful purposes in time to come: and at present
may furnish a very plausible if not a certain statement of the
proportional increase or decrease of the population of this
parish during all the above periods.
   A few remarks upon this subject, may tend to set it in a
clearer light.  It is generally supposed, that if we multiply
the annual births in a parish by 26, the product will give the
number of inhabitants.  But in this parish at least, this will
not hold at present: and I think, I can assign very sufficient
reasons for this.
   1st, The still born children, and those who die before bap-
tism are not registrated.
   2dly, Since the secession at first took place, a number, if not
the greater part of seceders, neglect to registrate their children.
   3dly, Since the duty was imposed upon baptisms, a still
greater number have neglected to do so, in order to evade the tax.
   4thly, In a manufacturing village like this, there are a
great many strangers who come to reside: and in proportion to
the encouragement they meet with, the number must increase.
For these or other reasons, we must multiply the number of
baptisms at present by 38, to give the number of inhabitants:
and the 
and the reason is, that upon an average, there are at least 8, if
not 10 children born annually, who for one or other of the
above reasons, are not registrated.
   Yet, if we multiply the births for every period by 38, I
fear this rule may be fallacious.  For before the secession took
place, and manufactures were introduced into this parish, or a
duty imposed on the parish register, the record was unquestion-
ably more complete.
