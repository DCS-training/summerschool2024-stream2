  I have been unable to discover when Mr P. Wemyss died, or
who was his successor, in consequence of the loss of the two oldest
volumes of the presbytery register of Perth, the first of which be-
gins about 1593. The third volume is the oldest one now in their
possession, beginning only at the year 1618. But it appears from
the MSS. of the late Rev. James Scott of Perth, which are now in
the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, that there was a minister here
named,
  2. Mr William Black, sometime before 16th September 1622,
and it appears that he either died here or was translated to an-
other parish in 1623.
  3. Mr John Hall was ordained here 6th November 1623. He
was called to Kilspindy and the annexed kirk of Rait on 6th May
1646, and admitted there on the 27th of May 1647. He was
formerly a preacher in the bounds of St Andrews presbytery, and
afterwards in Edinburgh. Several of Mr Hall's children were
baptized in Perth, and their names inserted in the Perth session
register. A considerable number of country ministers seems to
have resided at this time in Perth, probably owing to the want of
convenient manses.
  4. Mr Robert Young was presented by the town-council of
Edinburgh, and ordained at Dunbarny on the 3d of February
1647. This excellent minister was deposed after the Restoration
on the 13th December 1664, by Archbishop Sharpe, for noncon-
formity, by a sentence passed in the Archbishop's own chamber,
only one minister being present. The circumstances attending
the deposition are narrated in  Wodrow's Church History +, and
illustrate the character of Mr R. Young.
  Notices of Mr Robert Young are found in the presbytery re-
gister of Perth, under the following dates, 19th March 1651;
June 2d 1652, March 28th 1665, February 4th 1657, April 8th
1657.
  It appears, from   Wodrow's Church History, that Mr Young
was alive in March 12, 1673. No notice can be traced of his
subsequent history, with the exception of a short statement occur-
ring in the session  records. From this it appears, that such was
the regard be entertained for the parish of Dunbarny, and such
