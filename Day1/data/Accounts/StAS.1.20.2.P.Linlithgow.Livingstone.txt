     Statistical Account

mond and breich; on the west by the parish of Whitburn.
which was formerly a part of the parish of Livingstone, but
disjoined and erected into a separate parish about the year
1730; and on the north by the parishes of Bathgate and 
Uphall.

   Extent.-The figure of the parish has some resemblance
to that of a sand-glass, being betwixt 4 and 5 miles in length
from east to west, about a mile and a half in breadth at each
end, and intersected in the middle to about half a mile.  It 
contains near 4000 acres, all arable, and inclosed to a mere
trifle.

   Soil.-The soil is various, but in general inclined to clay,
and in many places the bottom is tilly, which occasions a
wetness difficult to remedy.  This defect, however, is in
some measure atoned for, by various strata of lime, coal,
iron-stone, free-stone, etc.-And notwithstanding the damp-
ness, the air is certainly salubrious, as there are no diseases
which are peculiar to this spot: on the contrary, it has exhi-
bited many instances of extreme longevity.

   Proprietors.The property of this parish is devided
amongst 5 heritors, viz. Sir William Augustus Cunyng-
hame of Livingstone, the patron, George Moncrieff, Efq. of
Blackburn, John Hamilton, Efg; of Pencaitland, Thomas
Shairp, Efg; of Houstoun, and William Honyman, Efg; of
Graemsay, now Lord Armadale, one of the Senators of the
College of Justice.-Sir William is proprietor of about two-
thirds of the parish, and he and Mr. Moncrueff are the only
residing heritors.-The valued rent is something above
L. 3000 Scotch; and the real rent, by recent and expensive
improvements, is near L.3000 Sterling.
