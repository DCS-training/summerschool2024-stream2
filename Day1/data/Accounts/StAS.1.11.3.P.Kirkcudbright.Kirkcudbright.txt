     of Kirkcudbright.

The general form of it, and the districts, with which it is
surrounded, will appear from the annexed map.  The parish
is mostly hilly, and has but little extended plain.  The hills,
however, do not rise very high; nor do they terminate at the
top in rocky points.  They slope gradually, and form a very
obtuse angle with the plain.  Along the sides of the hills,
and even up to their highest summits, they are generally arable.
Such as are not abound with excellent pasture.  Not unfre-
quently the deepest soil is to be found at the top of the hill.
This perhaps may be owing to the air, operating more power-
fully upon the high lands, which are more exposed to its in-
fluence, and gradually dissolving the rotten rocks, of which
the tops of these hills are here chiefly composed, and by this
means forming a deeper soil.

   Soil.-The soil of this parish is chiefly of two kinds, wet
and dry, The wet soil is occasioned by a hard, cold till,
which is generally found upon these hills; whole surface is
smooth, and lies about 6 inches below the superficies.  The
till, by retaining the water, proves highly detrimental to ve-
getation.  Manure, in this case, is of little or no use.  For
such soils, after having been covered with a sufficient quantity
of marle, lime or sea shells, prove very ungrateful, either in
the production of corn or of grass.  The dry soil, which is:
the most general, consists of a light, hazely earth, with a sharp
gravelly bottom.  This kind of soil is about 6 1/2 inches deep;
and, when covered with any of the former manures, and pro-
perly treated, it makes a most ample return; especially if
the seasons are warm, and attended with frequent showers.
The soil in this care is astonishingly productive, both of grass
and corn.  Although the lands, when not overcropped, pro-
duce excellent grain, yet, from the peculiar quality of the
grass that grows here, they are particularly adapted for fat
