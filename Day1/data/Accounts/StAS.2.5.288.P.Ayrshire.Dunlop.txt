	In the course of this century, that part of the barony of Mar-
tinham in this parish, consisting of about 500 acres, (formerly let
as a grazing-farm, but without either a house or a residenter on
it,) has been subdivided into several farms, and has now eleven
dwelling-houses, inhabited by upwards of seventy souls.
	With the improvements in the parish, the rental has also
kept pace, having, in the course of thirty years, been more than
tripled. In 1792, it amounted to L. 1570 Sterling; in 1807, to
L. 3525; and in 1822, to L. 5192.
	In l736, the number of births was l3; in l786, 12; and in l836,

to L. 12; and in 1836 to L. 30.

	     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

	Name.--The name of this parish is supposed to be derived
from two Gaelic words, dun, a fortified height, and luib, a wind-
ing, as of a stream. According to local tradition, the Castle of
Dunlop stood in ancient times on, the top of a small, eminence,
(still called Dunlop Hill,) near the church. As the stream which
passes Dunlop winds round the base of this hill, a castle so si-
tuated might have been appropriately called dun-luib, or the forti-
fied hill at the winding; and it has been conjectured, that the name
of this baronial residence was afterwards given to the church, and
the parochial district annexed to it.
	Extent, Boundaries, &c.--This parish is of an oblong form. Its
extreme length from S. W. to N. E. is about 7 miles, and its ge-
neral breadth nearly 2 miles. At the southern and northern extre-
mities it becomes much narrower, being for about a mile of length
