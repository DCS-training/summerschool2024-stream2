   These subsist by the immediate produce of the land, and
occupy farms from 15 to 50, and from 50 to 150 acres.
There are but a very few of the first, several of them having
been united.  This, however, has had little effect upon the
population, many of the old houses being still occupied by
cottagers.

   Agriculture.-On the firms black cattle and some horses
are reared; of the former, there are a considerable number,
for the farmers generally breed their own stock, and a
good many for the market besides, which, when sold, as
milk cows at a proper age, commonly bring from L. 6 to
L. 9.  With respect to the latter, it has been the practice
here to buy young horses at the age of 4 or 5 to use them
for a year or two, and then to sell before they begin to fall
off, by which method it is generally contrived to have the
work of the horse for the expense of his maintenance, and
even a little profit between buying and selling; but of late
this practice is almost laid aside, and that of breeding come
in its place.  Such horses as are reared in the parish, are of
an excellent kind, particularly fit for the draught, and when
brought to market, have sold for upwards of L. 30 Sterling.
