     Statistical Account

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church was built in the
year 1757, and the manse a considerable time before.  The
latter has lately undergone a complete and thorough repair,
and is now comfortable and commodious.  The stipend is
paid partly in money, and partly in grain; the amount of
the whole, including the glebe, is, communibus annis, from
85 L. to 90 L. Alexander Renton, Esq; of Lammerton is
patron.  The author of this account has been greatly in-
debted to this gentleman, for his obliging information and
assistance in drawing it up.  The school-master's salary is
7 L. per annum.  The poor are maintained chiefly by assess-

church being trifling.  Until within these 10 years, there
never was a person on the poor's roll.  Since that time they
have not been numerous.  At present there are only two
that receive a weekly aliment.

situated on the N. W. extremity of the parish, and commands
a beautiful prospect over a vast tract of country.  It seems to
have been a well chosen station for the predatory excursions
of barbarous ages, and also for keeping up a communication
with the sea, from which it is at no great distance.  It is sur-
rounded by two deep trenches, which are still very entire;
the mounds of them seem once to have been faced with
stones.  Many of these stones have been carried away for
different purposes: what is remarkable, a kind of stone has
been found there, which is not to be seen in any other part
of the country, except in the bed of the river Whitadder,
from whence they must have been brought, a distance of
near, 4 miles, and all up-hill, which in those days must have
