with safety to the amount of two Scotch pints in the course
of the day; though there are not many who can easily take
so large a quantity.
   It is certainly taken to most advantage at the fountain-
head, or in the room where the company assemble to drink
the water; there are many instances, however, of people of
great irritability, and who are very weak, beginning to-
drink it in bed in the morning with success.
   There is frequently a numerous genteel company here,
drinking the water during the season, which depends very
much on the weather; it commonly begins in the month
of June, and terminates in August or September.
   There are such crowds of country people who resort to
it in the month of July, that frequently the spring does not
afford so much water as they would drink, and before 6 or
7 o'clock in the morning, the well is often literally dry.
The company indeed at that time are not easily satisfied,
for many of them drink from 6 to 8 Scotch pints in the
day, besides from a mutchkin to a Scotch pint of sea-water,
and eating large quantities of dilse.  They cannot be con-
vinced, that the mineral water can be of any service to
their complaints without proving laxative, which is not its
ordinary effect, and they have generally very severe exer-
cise during the time they remain here; they are often
much reduced in their strength before they leave this place;
they frequently ask advice in what manner the water
should be taken, but with great reluctance follow it, if the
water has no sensible effects during their stay here.
   They come here indiscriminately for all diseases, without
taking any previous advice.  I have seen many, who were
in the last stage of a consumption, and others who had been
drinking the mineral water for several days in large quan-
tities, with constant fever on them, and whom with diffi-
culty I have persuaded to return home.
