     of Stornoway.

     SUPPLEMENT,

     By another Hand.

   STRONOWAY has its modern name from the situation of
the village, which is built on a point jutting into the har-
bour, and in the language of the country called Stron a
Bhaigh, or, the Nose of the Bay, from which, by an easy
transition, comes Stornoway.  Ui was the ancient name of
the parish.  There is in it a place called Ui, which was of
old the only place of worship in the parish, and is situated
on a narrow neck of land; every such neck of land, or isth-
mus, whether formed by creeks of the sea, or by the appro-
ximation of fresh-water lakes, is in Lewis called Ui, which,
in the Danish language signifies any such neck of land;
and the particular Ui already mentioned having been in
former time the only place devoted to divine worship, gave
its ancient name to the parish.

   The extent of it is ten computed miles in length, and its
breadth in some places seven.  It is bounded by the parish
of Barvas on the north; on the north-east by the channel
between Lewis and the main of Scotland; and on the south
and west by the parish of Lochs.  The general appearance
of it is a flat moor, of little utility to beasts, and of none to
man, all covered with heath.  The island is compared to a
gold-laced hat; the internal part of which consists of this
soft and useless moor, and the circumference of which is in
part more or less cultivated at the sea-side.  Near the town
of Stornoway the soil is a light black mould, forced into
some culture from moss; to the northward, the soil is co-
vered by drifted sand; but farther back, of similar quality
to that near the town.  Neither of these soils, when pro-
perly drained and manured, can be called unfertile.
