crops do not.  They are the chief means of subsistence to the poor-
er classes of people, for at least three quarters of the year.  No
one who has land in his possession, refuses a potatoe rigg to a
poor person; and very often they have both land and dung
given them, for nothing.-They have lately got into the me-
thod of setting potatoes with the plough.  The ground is plow-
ed twice or thrice, and perfectly cleaned of weeds:  It is then
dunged, the dung is plowed in, and the land is harrowed.
The plowman than begins at one side of the field, and makes 
a surrow.  A number of people follow him dropping in the
seed, so that the row is set as soon as the surrow is drawn.  As
he returns with the plough, he covers the potatoes with a light
surrow, and follows the same plan, till the whole field is gone
over.  The seed potatoes are set at six or eight inches, and the
rows are placed at three feet distance from each other.  To
dung the whole field is judged better for the land, and for the
crop that is to follow, than to lay the dung only in the surrow,
when the potatoes are set.  Besides the word is much more ex-
peditiously carried on.  The distance of the row admits a horse
and plow to lay up the earth to the potatoes, so often as may
be necessary.-A crop of wheat has been tried after the po-
tatoes set in this manner, and has turned out very well.
   The crops produced in the parish, are of late years, more
than sufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants.  The
towns of Girvan and Ballantrae, have received the surplus.  It
is only of late years, that the farmers have had any encourage-
ment to raise more grain than was necesary for the consump-
tion of the neighbourhood; remote from any good market,
and no cart road by which it could be conveyed to a distance.

   Roads.-While the making and repairing of roads de-
pended only upon the statute-labour, nothing to purpose ei-
ther was, or could be, done in this part of the country.  An
