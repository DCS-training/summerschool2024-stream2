	tract of very calm weather, in which, for days together, scarcely
	a breath of wind can be felt.
	  Climate.-Tbe climate is, during a great part of the seasons,
 	decidedly damp.  It is also very variable, except during the sum-
	mer months, and after long-continued frosts of winter and spring.
	It is, however, decidedly healthy, and many of the inhabitants
	live to a great age.
	   We have before us a register of the state of the barometer and
	thermometer at Killin, at 8 A. M. and P. M., kept by the late Mr
	M'Gibbon, schoolmaster, from the year 1800 till his death, and
	since that time by a member of his family.  The following table
	gives the average for 1820, for each month, and for the whole
	year:-

	  In the opinion  of some, the winters are not so cold, nor the
	summers quite so warm now as they were then;  but the average
	is still the same.  The state of the thermometer, for May 1840,
	was 50.9, and for November, 43.1.
	  Hydrography.-The principal lake connected with the parish
	is Lochtay, at the west end of which Killin is situated.  It extends
	eastward from Killin to Kenmore, about fifteen miles, varying
	from one to two miles in breadth.  It is generally, of great
	depth, and has never been known to freeze.  The scenery
	of Lochtay is much admired, especially at the two extremi-
	ties.  The mountains on either side, and especially on tbe
	north, are lofty, and rise abruptly from the edge of the loch.
	Its shores are also tastefully skirted with wood, and the slop-
	ing sides of the mountains, are cultivated to the height gene-
	rally of about half a-mile from the margin of the lake.  To the
	tourist in search of views and romantic scenery, the road by the
	south side of the lake is recommended.   Into Lochtay, two rivers
	discharge their waters, the Dochart and the Lochay.  The for-
