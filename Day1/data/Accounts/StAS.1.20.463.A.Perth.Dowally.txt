     of Dowally

   The whole inhabitants may be considered as employed
in agriculture; for though there is a smith, two wrights, and
two tailors in the parish, yet all of them, to some small ex-
tent, are concerned in labouring the ground.  There are
no separate manufactures yet established here.  The num-
ber of inhabitants, compared with the number of acres in
the parish, allows 1 to 17 acres.

   Baptisms.-The register of baptisms has been kept, and
with unusual regularity; and from that register it appears,
1.  That during a period of 76 years, preceding 1797, there
have been born 687 males, and 572 females.  2.  That
while the population continued nearly the same, the num-
ber of births in different years has differed very widely.  In
1711, 1726, and 1752, the total number was 6; and in 
1712, 1725, and 1751, the years immediately adjoining to
these, they were respectively 13, 16, an 20.  In some
years they amounted to 24; but the average number may
be rated at 16.  This average number is at the rate of 1
birth to 43 persons.  3.  That in different years the propor-
tion of male and female births also differs widely.  In 1780
there were 16 males born, and 6 females; while, in 1782,
there were 10 female, and only 7 male births.  4.  That, as
the number of families in the parish amounts to 164, and
the number of births annually  is 16, there is 1 annual birth
for each 10 families.

   Twins.-From the register of baptism it also appears,
1.  That of 1225 children born in this parish, 34 were
twins; therefore 1 twin child for every 34 born.  2.  That
of the 34 twins, 23 were males, and 11 females.  3.  That
though it has been concluded from observations made in
other places, that the number of males prevailed in those
years in which male twins were born, and that of the fe-
