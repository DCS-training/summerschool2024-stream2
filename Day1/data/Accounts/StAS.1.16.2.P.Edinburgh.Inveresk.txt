     Statistical Account

tains of Morsit on the S. and Pentland on the N. that 
bound the great vale of Mid-Lothian, meet in Dal- 
keith Park near the confines of this parith, and flow to-
gether through a beautiful vale to the sea; within half a 
mile of which, the river is  interrupted in its course, by the 
hill where the church and village of Inveresk stand.  Round
this hill the stream circulates to the W., when turning the
Point, and running between Musselburgh and Fisherrow, 
in the direction of N. E., it falls into the sea a quarter of a
mile below these towns.  Musselburgh has derived its
name from an extensive muscle bank, which lies in the sea     
below the town, and was probably the cause of its early 
population; as, even at this day, it affords a great relief to 
the poorer inhabitants in times of fearcity, and at all times 
supplies the tables of the rich with a delicate variety.  This
parish lies in a femicircular form, on the bottom of the 
deepest bay on the S. side of the frith of Forth, the string
of the bow extending two miles and a half, from Mag- 
dalene Bridge on the W. to Ravenshaw Burn on the E.,
which divides the county of Edinburgh, or Mid-Lothian, 
from that of East Lothian.  The bow itself, taking the
middle of the string as a centire, reaches nearly to the same 
distance, of 2 1/3 miles from the sea.

   Prospects, etc- The situation of this parish is one of the
most beautiful in Scotland.  The low part of it is only a
few feet above the level of the sea; between which, and 
the towns of Musselburgh and Fisherrow, lie very spacious
and pleasant links, those beautiful downs on the sea-shore, 
almost peculiar to Scotland, which furnish a field for that
favourite exercise of the inhabitants, the golf, and dry 
walks at all seasons of the year.  Behind this slat or plain,
through which the river runs into the sea, and which is about
