ward has a chief constable empowered to command, as if he were
a military officer.  There is likewise a second in command, to aid
the head constable with his advice, and to command in his absence.
Each ward is divided into eight or more districts, according to the
extent and population.  The captain or head of each district keeps
a roll of his men, and his duty is to warn them to attend the ge-
neral rendezvous, when notified to him by his commander.  The
number enrolled in the four parishes exceeds 500.  The whole
may be collected in less than one hour, ready to disperse any mob
or riot that may take place, on receiving orders from the magis-
trates in the town, or the Sheriff or Justices in the suburbs;
without which they are not empowered to act.  This effective
and honourable body of men has been employed on various occa-
sions to command and preserve the peace; and always with com-
plete success.  What adds to the value of this institution, is, that
it is completely constitutional.  There are no weapons of war
brought in to operation.  There is no compulsion as to the service,
and little or no expense is incurred.  The disorderly and evil-in-
tentioned, conscious that they are in danger of being discovered,
if any attempt is made to disturb the public peace, are thus kept
in check, and regularity and peaceable conduct have thus been pre-
served in very critical times.  The principle of the establishment
claims an antiquity as high as the days of Alfred the Great; and
the plan itself is certainly deserving of imitation in every populous
town and district of the country.
   Progress of crime.-In the following table is exhibited a view
of the state and Progress of crimes, &c. as judged by the magis-
trates, from the period when the police establishment began down
to 1818, and for the last five years.  The melancholy progress
of crime, particularly of late years, may be judged of from this
table; a progress for which the rapid increase of population will
not wholly account.
