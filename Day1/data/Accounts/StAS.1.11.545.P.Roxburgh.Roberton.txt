     of Roberton.

   Antiquities, Cascade, etc.-There are several remains of en-
campments and fortifications.  One large square encampment,
flanked by a rivulet, whose banks are steep, having the
Borthwick in front, and artificial ramparts towards the hill,
bears to this day the name of Africa.  Between this, and
others of a circular or semicircular form, the Cat-rail (of
which some vestiges, though with breaks, may still be traced),
is supposed to have run*.  One of these semicircular encamp-
ments, above 2 miles from the square one, and of which it
has a distinct view, has, for its diameter, the steep and craggy
bank of a rivulet, where there is a beautiful cascade; the fall
of water being about 20, and the breadth 6 feet, when the
rivulet is in flood.
