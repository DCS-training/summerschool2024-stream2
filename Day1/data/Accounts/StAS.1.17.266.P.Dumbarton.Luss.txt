     Statistical Account

   Schools and Poor.-There are two schools, for each of
which a good house has been lately built.  One of these is
the parish school, in which the number of scholars is gene-
rally from 30 to 50.  The salary is 10 L. Sterling.  The
school fees for reading English are 1 s. 6 d. per quarter; for
reading and writing, 2 s.; for arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d.; and for
Latin, 5 s.  The other school is supported by the Society
for propagating Christian Knowledge.  The number of scho-
lars who attend it, during the whole or part of the year, is
about 80.  The emoluments of the schoolmaster consist of
13 L. Sterling of salary, a dwelling house, garden, cow's grass,
and some school fees.  The children of the poor are taught
gratis.
   The Society have likewise of late allowed a salary for a
sewing school at Luss.  The number of poor, at present up-
on the roll, is 10.  Some of these get weekly, and others
occasional supplies, according to their necessities.  The funds
for their support arise from the collections on Sunday, rents
of seats in the church, marriage and mort-cloth dues, and
the interest of 150 L. Sterling of stock, amounting, at an a-
verage, to 37 L. Sterling yearly.  L. 50 of the said stock
were bequeathed by the late Robert Carmichael, Esq; of
Broomley.

   Language and Character.-South from Luss, English, and
north from it the Gaelic, is the prevailing language.  The
service in church is performed in each of these.-The peo-
ple, in general, are sober and industrious, humane and cha-
ritable.  They are regular in their attendance on the ordi-
nances of religion.  The example, in this respect, of the fa-
milies of chief rank for many years past, has, without doubt,
had considerable influence upon those in inferior stations.
