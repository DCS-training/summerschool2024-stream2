should obtain the victory, he would build a church upon
the field of battle.  Victory having declared in his favour,
he performed his vow, and gave his own name to the church.
The vestiges of a small circular camp about half an English
mile to the south, and the great number of large whin or muir
stones that were lately standing about 200 yards to the east,
of this place, in such a form as might give reason to suppose
that those who fell in the battle were buried there, are cir-
cumstances which seem to confirm the tradition.  Some time
after, Oswald got possession of his father's kingdom; and,
being zealous for the establishment of Christianity, and very
friendly to the clergy, was, after his death, canonized as a
Saint.  It is well known that, within the antient kingdom
of Northumberland, there is a town called Kirkoswald, after
this king.  In this town there is an annual fair upon the fifth
day of August; and there has, for time immemorial, been
a fair in this place on the same day.  This fact seems also to
countenance the above tradition.

   Situation, Erection, Extent, and Prospects.-The parish is
situated in that district of Ayrshire, called Carrick, and in
the presbytery of Ayr.  Prior to 1652, the extent of this
parish was considerably larger than it is at present.  At that
time the parish of Barr was erected from the high and dis-
tant parts of the parishes of Girvan, Dailly, and Colmonel.
To make up what was taken from the parishes of Dailly and
Girvan, a considerable track of land upon the north-west side
of the water of Girvan, amounting to a fourth part of this
parish, was annexed to Dailly and Girvan.  The greater
part by far of the proprietors lands have been exactly mea-
sured; and by taking the mean length and breadth of the
whole, there appear to be near 11000 Scots acres.  The sea-
coast of the parish from north to south is six English miles;
