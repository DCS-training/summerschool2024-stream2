by which we can venture to ascribe its origin to so remote a
period.  Under the bellfry, there appears a date beginning
51; but of which the remaining cyphers, and other inscrip-

marle of Dudingston loch, the head and horns of a stag,
some coins, the inscriptions of which were effaced, the blade
of a sword, and the heads of some spears and javelins, all
from their structure and materials believed to be Roman,
were discovered.  Some of these were sent to the museum

London.  The boroughs of Linlithgow and Peebles, are also
said to have been bound to uphold this causeway; and it is
known to have been a common practice of the above-men-
