     of Sandwick and Stromness.

   Retailers of Ale and Spirits.-As the excise of this county
is compounded, many of the farmcrs brew ale for sale du-
ring winter, so that the number of occasional retailers can-
not be precisely ascertained; and although a great deal of
grain is consumed in this way, and there are complaints
against it, yet it may be presumed, that it is neither so per-
nicious to the health, the morals, or the circumstances of
the people as drinking spirits, which prevails in other coun-
tries among the lower classes, and at all seasons of the
year; whereas this practice of brewing ale prevails among
the farmers here only during winter, or the first of spring.
Nor is it here the sottish enjoyment of drinking alone;
they often have music and dancing at these meetings;

     - and, shook to notes
     Of native music, the respondent dance.
     Thus jocund fleets with them the winter night*.

   The regular and constant retailers of ale and spirits are:
Retailers of ale, 23 in the village of Stromness; retailers
of spirits, 3 in Sandwich parish, 3 in Stromness parish, and
7 in the village of Stromness.

   Church, Patron, Stipend.-There is a church in each of
these parishes.  The parish church of Stromness formerly
flood a mile distant from where the village is situated;
at present, the parish-church stands in the village of Strom-
ness, and the old parish-church is ruinous.  The present
church was built in 1717, and is not large enough to ac-
commodate the people of the parish and village, as the in-
habitants of the village have increased greatly since that
time.  The church of Sandwick was rebuilt in 1 70, by
Andrew Honyman, Bishop of Oikney; and again rebuilt
