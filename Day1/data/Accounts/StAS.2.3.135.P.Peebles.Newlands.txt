	THE REV. CHARLES FINDLATER, MINISTER.


	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
    Extent, &c.-THE, parish may be considered as about 11 miles
in length, and about 2 miles in the average breadth, in whole,
probably, 11000 or 12000 acres.
    A chief part of the low land lies in a vale, which is bounded to-
wards the south-east by a range of hills, called Kellyheads, run-
ning parallel to the range of the Pentland hills. This vale is
bounded on the opposite side by a low hilly ridge, passing under
different names, such as Dodhead and Broomyleas. In the bot-
tom of this vale there is a moss, called Hallmyre bog, of about 60
acres, along the middle of which a very deep and wide ditch was cut
down to a gravelly bottom, full of springs, by the late William
Gordon, Esq. of Hallmyre, into which the bog has been drained
by cross-drains, and is now all good arable land. With the inter-
ruption of Lyne water, which cuts it nearly at right angles, this
vale continues, bounded by lesser hills, or rather a swelling ridge,
along the public road till you arrive at the bridge over the Terth,
which water forms the boundary of the parish with that of Kirkurd
and of Stobo.
    The vale of the Lyne is bounded on the one side by the Kelly-
heads range above-mentioned, taking various names, and interrupt-
ed only by the small burn, called Flemington-mill burn, and the
still smaller ones of Stevenson burn, and Hagen-hope burn, all fal-
ling from the east into Lyne vale, which last forms the boundary
with the parish of Lyne. This vale is bounded on the other side
of the Lyne water by gently rising acclivities, which on their op-
posite side descend to the water of Terth before-mentioned, as
the boundary with the parishes of Kirkurd and Stobo.
    Besides these vales, the parish extends over the tops of the
range Of the Kellyheads, and down their opposite sides to Fle-
