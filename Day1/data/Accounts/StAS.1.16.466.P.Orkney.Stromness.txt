in carrying grain to the mill, or in delivering his rent.-
The payment of the rent mostly in malt is a bar to im-
provements, because, on small farms, they cannot afford to
pay the rent, and also fallow any considerable part of their
lands.

   Means by which their Condition might be ameliorated.-
The condition of the farmers might be ameliorated by
these means:  1st.  To grant them long leases:  2dly, To
repair their houses:  3dly, That the proprietor inclose, at
his own expence, one or two acres on each farm:  4thly,
That the proprietor supply the farmer with grass-seeds for
the first year to sow these two acres, and direct him in the
management, and make it a nullity in his lease if he does
not keep the like quantity of ground in sown grass, for a
certain number of years, until he is sensible of the benefit
of it:  5thly, That one-half the rent be converted to mo-
ney:  6thly, That the roads be made good:  7thly, That
the limestone be burnt, since, dear as the fuel is, it may be
burnt to advantage.
   As there is plenty of water, a tannery might be esta-
blished near the village of Stromness.  Some branch of
manufacture might be established, wherein to employ the
women to more advantage than knitting stockings.
   As the genius of the people is turned to sea-affairs, it
would be of great advantage if there were a few men of
spirit and enterprize, and possessed of capital sufficient to
carry on the herring fishery, rope-making, sail-making,
net-making.  As there is a great resort of shipping, there
would be a readier sale for some of these articles than at
Cromarty, where some of these branches were carried on
by the late Mr Ross of that place.
