imitation of their pupils.  Without such a character, we can-
not expect from a teacher the conscientious discharge of his
duty, nor from the scholars much improvement in principle
or virtue, when his example is at continual war with his in-
junctions.-Of what literary attainments a schoolmaster ought
to be possessed, it will not be difficult to form an estimate,
by reviewing the task which we expect him to perform.  That
he should issue from one parish school, perfectly accoutred for
undertaking the management of another, though practice
has of late countenanced the mode, common sense will not
be ready to admit.  To conduct even the initiatory and sim-
ple parts of education, in a manner not entirely mechanical,
a certain enlargement of ideas, and extension of views, is
absolutely requisite.  If the knowledge of the master has been
acquired entirely in school, it is likely that it will be in con-
stant danger of rivalship from that of the elder students; and,
where no stock of general information renders him superior, a
thousand situations must occur, where he finds it impossible to
act the part of an instructor, and a thousand difficulties must
be started, which his ingenuity cannot resolve.  To qualify
him therefore for executing, in the best manner, the hum-
bler departments of his office, some liberal mode of study
mutt have been pursued: but nothing less than a regular
course at the university, is sufficient preparation for teaching
the true elements of knowledge, and communicating those
general principles, which enable the learner to proceed by
himself, and without which all learning is a mere automatic
process.-None, therefore, ought to be admitted as parish
schoolmasters, but such as are at least twenty-one years of
age, who have taken their degree at the university, and who
can produce liberal approbations of their moral character.
It would likewise be extremely proper, on their entrance, to
