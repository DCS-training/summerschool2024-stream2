   Thirlage, Multure, and Services.-Almost all the tenants
are bound to grind their corn at a certain mill; a practice
attended with many inconveniencies.  Why should a mil-
ler be on a different footing from any other tradesman?
   Multure is generally high in this parish*.  In some mills
it is converted, and paid with the rent; and should be so
in every case.  This, however, is not always practicable,
as the rent and multure are often paid to different heritors;
to remedy which would require a statute, abolishing thir-
lage, and empowering every landholder to redeem his
estate from this burden.  And a statute, which equally re-
spects the good of the heritor and tenant, which would put
a stop to an intricate and unreasonable practice obtruded
on the present times by the use and wont of darker ages,
and which would at once prevent law-suits, misunderstand-
ings, and complaints, certainly merits attention.  Services
are not universally abolished.

   Manufactures.-A great deal of flax is given out to spin
in this parish for the Aberdeen and Peterhead manufac-
tures.  A considerable quantity of linen-yarn, spun from

except what is used for seed, whether milled, sold. or malted.  This,
with the bannocks, knavesbips, and other nameless mill-tolls. (which are
sometimes one-fourth, sometimes one-eight and one-fourth of the multure,
and at some mills almost twice as much as at others), forms a heavy bur-
den on improving tenants; nearly thus:

     1/16+ 1/64+ 1/128 = 11/128 = 11 bolls in 128.

   Mr Ferguson, who is a very indulgent master to his tenants, has abolish-
ed the multures in all mills belonging to himself and all customs and
services in his property.
