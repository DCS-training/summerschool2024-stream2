     The Statistical Account

   The present castle of Hoddam, which was mentioned, in
the account which was transmitted, as having been built by
Lord Herreis in the days of Queen Mary, is, in the account
which is published, said to have been built by Lord Kerses.
I do not remember to have either read or heard of such a
Lord.
   The sum mortified to the poor by Mr Alexander, which
is L. 1195:6:4 Scots money, is, in the Statistical Account,
said to be L. 1119:19:4.  This mistake originated with my-
self.  But, immediately after I transmitted the account of the
parish, recollected the mistake, and wrote a letter to you
correcting it, which, amidst the number of objects with
which you have been engaged, has escaped your attention.
   Instead of the east side of the old parish of Luce, on which
a considerable tract of land lies waste, it is, in the Statistical
Account, said the west side.
