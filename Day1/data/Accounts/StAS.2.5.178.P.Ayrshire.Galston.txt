four in Monkton; a number much greater than is required, and
certainly not favourable to the moral habits of the people.
	Fuel.--The fuel used in the parish is universally coal, which is
procured, the best of it, from the collieries in the neighbourhood of
Kilmarnock, also from Newton, and from the collieries on the
water of Ayr, at an expense, including carriage, of between 5s. and
5s. 9d. per single horse cart.

	              MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The most striking change in the parish since the date of last
Statistical Account, is in regard to the agriculture, the mode of
farming, and the amount of farm produce raised, and of the rental
of the parish. At the date of last Statistical Account there was
little or no wheat sown; now the annual value of wheat raised is
L. 3032, 19s. In 1791 the amount of oats raised in this parish was
L. 1315 bolls, and of bear or barley, 399 bolls; now the annual value
of oats raised is L. 2855, and of barley L. 119. In 1791 there
were 6 or 7 acres of turnips, and 23 or 24 acres of potatoes; now
the annual amount of potatoes and turnips raised is 215 acres,
valued at L. 3092. And finally, in 1791, the rental of the parish
was supposed to be between L. 1800 and L. 2000; now it is
L. 4509, 17s. The chief improvement in the husbandry of the
parish is tile-draining in every furrow, or every alternate furrow,
which might be applied to a large portion of the parish with the
most important results. And the chief error in the system seems
to be too frequent white-cropping, as it appears even under the
best management in other respects, to be impairing the productive-
ness of the soil.
