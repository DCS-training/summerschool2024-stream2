feet by 12, and is so constructed as to receive the steam
from a boiler of cast-iron, containing ten English gallons,
placed over a furnace, built about the middle of the back-
wall, into a chamber, occupying the whole space below the
melon-earth, which is supported by an arch of brick, so
built, that the ends of the bricks leave about an inch open
space for the steam to pass, while the sides are cemented
with lime, over which is placed a layer of wheat-straw,
about an inch thick, and then the melon-mould.  The pit
is about four feet deep behind, and two and a half or three
before.  A pit, of the above dimensions, will require two
longitudinal arches, the one next the forepart of the pit,
lower than the one parallel to the back part, so as to give a
proper declivity to the surface of the m lon-earth; and the
mid-wall, which supports the arches, is full of openings, to
let the steam pass freely; care also must be taken, so to con-
struct the funnel for dividing the steam, that it may bear
equally upon all parts of the frame.  Melons raised in this
way are thought to be thinner skinned, and rather higher
flavoured than those produced in the common way.

   Pine Stoves.-No doubt, steam might be applied to pine
stoves with equal advantage; and it is probable, that the
pit above described, or one upon the fame principles, would
answer every purpose of raising pines.

   Vinery.-At Castle-Huntly steam is introduced into a
vinery, and it is proposed to be tried in peach-houses also;
but in these last, the steam is guided by pipes of tinned
copper, 1 1/2 inch in diameter, conducted from the boiler, pla-
ced over the fame furnace which heats the house, and car-
ried round about half a foot above the back flue, and 1 1/2
foot above the front flue, but in a contrary direction, with
cocks opening at different places, so as to divide the steam
