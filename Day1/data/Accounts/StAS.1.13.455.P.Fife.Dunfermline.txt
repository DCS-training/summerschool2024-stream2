naturally expect, that the royal tombs would to nish us 
with something worthy of his attention; but it is little in
our power to gratify the antiquary; were it note that the 
page of history assures us, that with us are the ulchers
of kings, it could not now be otherwise discovered- The
principal part of the church appears to have been demo-
lished at the time of the Reformation, and to have buried
the royal monuments in its ruins.  The area of this part 
of the church is covered with rubbish to the depth of 3 or
4 feet; it has long been used as burying ground and on
that account cannot now be explored.  In digging grave
lately, there was discoverd a stone-coffin 6 feet in length,
containing human bones; at the same time were bound se-
veral fragments of a marble monument, which had been
finely carved and gilt.  Here is shown what is faid to have
been the tomb-stone of St Margaret, and 6 flat stones each 
9 feet in length, where as many kings are faid to be.

*In this church-yard, a handsome monument has been erased to the
memory of the late Earl of Elgin, a Nobleman whose memory is dear
to those who had the happiness of being known to him.  has a 
person in any rank of life been more generally beloved seldom has high
rank been distinguished for so many virtues, such amiable and conde-
scending manners.  Respected and beloved in life, his dear was the 
cause of sincere and general sorrow and regret in this.  We shall 
transcribe the following elegant tribute to his memory.
