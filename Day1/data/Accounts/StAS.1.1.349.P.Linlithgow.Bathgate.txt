   Minerals-A considerable quantity of free-stone, of various
quality, is dug from open quarries in the parish.  A lime-
stone rock, thirty feet deep, the property of the Earl of Hope-
toun, Mr Marjoribanks, and Mr Paterson Shairp, affords ex-
cellent lime; 20 hands are usually employed in the quarry,
and burning lime.  Several kinds of spar, and shells of va-
rious forts, are sometimes met with in it.  A small vein of
silver ore was found in this rock a few years ago, but it was
too inconsiderable to bear the expence of working.  A large
field of iron-stone, of a superior quality, was lately wrought
by the Carron Company in the lands of Barbachlaw, in this
parish.  There is abundance of coal in several parts of this
district.  In one of Lord Hopetoun's collieries near Bathgate,
there are seven different teams of coal, from seven inches to
seven feet thick; the deepest team, at present, is 40 fathons
deep.  In this work 20 coal miners are constantly employed;
each of whom works from 15 to 25 loads a day.  The load
is 12 Linlithgow pecks, and sells on the hill at 6 d. the great,
and 4 d. the small coal.  The whole number supported by
this colliery, including miners, bearers, etc. is 95; of whom
30 are children incapable of working.  There is besides, an
inexhaustible quantity of moss in the parish; so that many of
the farmers and cottagers burn peat, at least in part.  The
great increase of the village of Bathgate since 1750 has been
chiefly owing to the collieries; to which cause also, must be
attributed the great influx of poor into this town and neigh-
bourhood.

   Agriculture, etc.-Oats, barley, peace, beans, turnips, po-
tatoes, cabbage, flax, and sometimes carrots, are the chief
produce of the parish.  Nearly about two-thirds of the 1200
or 1300 acres of arable land in the parish are sown with oats;
the rest mostly with barley, pease, beans, and potatoes; wheat,
