pretty frequent.  There is just now living a woman aged 937
and, within these few years, two men died at the age of 95
or 96.  Several attain to 80 and upwards.  It is worthy of
remark, that three ministers in succession, though each above
thirty years of age at his admission, served the cure of this
parish from 1647 to 1782, a period of 135 years.

   Soil.-The foil is of various qualities.  Perhaps there may
be one half of the lands in the parish not capable of being
cultivated to any advantage by the plough.  One part of
these is bog-land, on which grows a kind of coarse grass, that
is sometimes pastured by young cattle; sometimes it is cut for
hay, and is reckoned excellent winter food for cattle that
are not of sufficient age to be fed on turnip.  Though a
great part of this land has already been drained at consider-
able expence; yet, as this is the only species of improvement
of which it is capable, certainly more ought still to be done
to carry off the water, which, in particular places, continues
to stagnate.
   The other part of these lands that are not capable of be-
ing cultivated with advantage by 'the plough, consists of
ground covered with deep moss, or which, from the height
of its situation, even where the soil is tolerably goods is not
adapted to the raising of corn, and consequently would not
pay the expence of improvement by lime, which is the only
manure that has been used with effect to any extent for bring-
ing in heath lands in this corner of the country.
   The other half of the lands in the parish may be divided
into such as are already cultivated by the plough, and such
as are capable of being cultivated in this manner.
The soil of these lands is, in some places, a whitish cold
clay, which is by no means favourable to the views of the
husbandman.  In other places, particularly towards the south
