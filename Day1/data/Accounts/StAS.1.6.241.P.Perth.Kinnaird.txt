They are little susceptible either of the pleasures or pains
which result from a lively imagination and delicate sensibility
of temper; but though not remarkable for vivacity, they are

enthusiasm.  If, where it is in truth, it is accompanied with
little servour, it however operates as a calm, rational, steady
principle of wife and virtuous conduct.
