   It is with infinite satisfaction, that the Author has
brought this Volume to a conclusion, and presents the Pu-
blic, with the remainder of the Statistical Accounts of the
different Parishes in Scotland, without a single one being
omitted.  He thinks it proper, however, to add, that ano-
ther Volume is now in the Press, the printing of which has
already made considerable progress.  That Volume will
contain, not only such material additions to, or corrections
of, the Parochial Reports, as have been transmitted since
the original Accounts were printed, but also a very copious
General Index, carefully compiled, and divided into three
parts; the first, comprising all the Subjects treated of; the
second, the Names of the Persons; andt he third, the Names
of the Places, Lakes, Rivers, Mountains, &c. mentioned in
the Statistical Volumes.  The whole Work will therefore
be comprehended in Twenty-one Volumes.
   In regard to the proposed Analysis of the Statistical
Account of Scotland, or the result of the Inquiry, the
Author has begun that important undertaking, and will en-
deavour to complete it, as soon ashis leisure from other
avocations will admit.  It is a Work, however, that will
require so much attention and labour, that he trusts the Pu-
blic will excuse him, for not attempting to execute it in too
hasty a manner.
