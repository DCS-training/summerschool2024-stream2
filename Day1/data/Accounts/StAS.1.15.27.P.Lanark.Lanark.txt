from Ayr, which could be carried across the Clyde a
little above Hyndford bridge, and from thence by Doug-
las to Ayr.  This would not only accommodate the
thriving manufactures of Lanark, and the Cleugh iron
works, but, as it would pass over grounds containing
coal, lime-stone and iron-stone, would greatly promote
agriculture and manufactures of every kind; besides the
more general advantage arising from the expansion of
trade from sea to sea.

   Rental and heritors.  The valued rent of the parish
is L. 4217: 19: 10 Scots, and the real rent upwards of
L. 3000 Sterling.  The principal heritors are Charles
Wishart Lockhart, of Lee Esq; Allan Lockhart of Cleg-
horn, esq.  Lady Ross Baillie, and the honourable George
Baillie of Jervis-wood.  Besides those named, there are
six or seven lesser heritors, 55 small ones in the out pa-
rish, and 98 proprietors of burrow lands.  There are
only about 3 or 4 heritors that are non residents.

   Population.  The population of the parish, as returned
to Dr Webster in 1755, amounted to 2294 souls.  On
May 15th 1792, the number of examinable persons, i.e.
all above seven years of age, by the late incumbent's ex-
amination roll, amounted to 2693, exclusive of New La-
nark, or the cotton mills, to which when we add one fifth
more for the children under 7 years of age, we shall have
the sum total of 3231; so that the population of the pa-
rish including New Lanark will stand as under.
