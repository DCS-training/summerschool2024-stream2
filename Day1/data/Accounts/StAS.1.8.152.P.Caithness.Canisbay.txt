although his name be still illustrious, the spot is scarcely
distinguishable where he dwelt.  Westward from the burn
of Dungisbay to Huna, moss prevails to the sea brink.
From Huna to Gills, is one of the most fertile districts in the
parish.  The church is situated in the middle of it, on a
green rising ground, close by the shore, the manse about a

land in the greater abundance.  The shell shore of Dungis-
bay, yields lime of the first estimation for purity and white-

a peculiar activity and cleanliness to the soil.  The superior
