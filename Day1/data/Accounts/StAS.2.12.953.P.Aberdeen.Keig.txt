summer fallow, and takes the place of crops 1. and 2. above; two-
sided barley is not reckoned a profitable crop, and neither pease
nor beans are raised.  In harvest, the scythe has now almost en-
tirely superseded the sickle.  Distant carriage prevents the use
of such manures as whale and herring refuse and night soils, but
bone-dust is successfully employed.
   There were formerly many life-leases, of which two remain ;
the present term is nineteen years.  Under both the old and new
leases, the rent of same farms is payable partly in meal, but under
the new, the proportion of it is small; the tenants are, besides,
generally bound to bear their proportion of carriage of materials
for river embankments, for repairing or rebuilding the proprietor's
mansion-house, and the parish church, manse, and school-house,
and though there is no thirlage, to carry their grain to such mill
as may be specified.
   Some of the tenants certainly feel the want of sufficient capital;
but the principal disadvantage under which the whole labour, is
their distance from a sea-port, or a ready market for agricultural
produce.  In spite, however, of such obstacles, cultivated lands
continue to be more and more improved, wastes to be gradually
reclaimed, and rents not only to rise but to be well paid.

truth, though the quantity of corn has not been satisfactorily as-
certained.
