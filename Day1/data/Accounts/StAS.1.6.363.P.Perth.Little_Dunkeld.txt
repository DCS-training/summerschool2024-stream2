men of the parish, and a few individuals on a large scale of far-
ming, are beginning to be attentive in this respect.
   There are two kinds of sheep; the black faced, brought
from the southeren counties, and the white faced sort, which
may be called the native breed.  The former are bought when
a year old at 6 s. and after they have been kept here for two
years, and have yielded three fleeces, are sold for about 10 s. 6 d.
each; if kept a year longer they fetch 12 s.  They are general-
ly allowed to live in open air both night and day.  The native
kind are housed at night even at midsummer, and are much
inferior to the other both in weight and vigour; but their
wool is of much superior quality.  From the information of an
intelligent man in the trade, it would appear, that when the
wool of the black faced sheep sells (unsmeared) at 9 s. per stone,
that of the white faced brings 13 s. 4 d.  These two kinds are
somewhat mixed, as might be expected; yet it is surprising to
what a degree they still remain distinct.  The wedders of the
native sheep are sold to the butcher at about 8 s, and the ewes
at 7 s.  Their mutton is excellent.
   The lowest estimate of the number of horses in the parish is
624, of horned cattle of all ages 2528, and of sheep 8,496.

   Farms, Crops.-Till of late, four horses were yoked in a
plough, and for each plough, or ploughgate, there were at
least two, and in many instances, four partners.  Each te-
nant's land was interspersed in small ridges with that of his
neighbours; an arrangement commonly termed run-rig.  A-
bout 15 years ago the tenants began to divide the land among
themselves into small glebes or lots, and now they are begin-
ning to cast each tenant's land into one glebe.  This may be
considered as the first step towards improvement.  The old
four horse ploughs* have been divided into two horse ploughs,
