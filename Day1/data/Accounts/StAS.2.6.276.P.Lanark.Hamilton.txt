From a census taken some months ago, and which seems to be ac-
curate, there has been an increase of 309, which may be attri-
buted to the introduction and flourishing condition of a lace-ma-
nufactory, which now employs a great many females. Out of 9822
males and females, there are in this parish:

	The following tables nf births, marriages, and deaths, are from
authentic sources. The baptisms in the parish church for the last
seven years were as follows:

<TABLE>
Years.  Baptisms.  Marriages.  Deaths.  Years.  Baptisms.  Marriages.  Deaths.
1827,      146         83        177      1831,      145          79    261
1828,      137         69        196      1832,      162          75    267
1829,      124         65        248      1833,      136          98    220
1830,      156         97        157
	The average of baptisms is 143; and, if to these we add 200
for the Dissenters, the whole will be 343. Considerably more
than 200 per annum are baptized in the meeting-houses of the
Dissenters; but a large proportion of these are from neighbouring
parishes. The average of marriages is 81. The average of
deaths is 218. The number of males and females who died in
each month, between November 1832 and November 1833, is as
follows:

<TABLE>
	 Months.    Males.  Females.  Months.    Males.  Females.
         November,    11        15     May,        10        8
         December,    10         6     June,       12       10
         January,     11         7     July,       15       21

	The whole gives 126 males, and 140 females. This was the year
of the cholera,--a disease which carried off many individuals, par-
ticularly females. There appears in this parish to be one baptism
per annum to 27 persons, one burial to 45, and one marriage to
117 nearly. Throughout the whole of England the proportion is
33, 49, and 120; and in Wales, 37, 60, and l36. The advantage
is every way on the side of the above countries; but this does not
proceed from any superiority in their climate or mode of living, but
merely from the fact, that the averages above alluded to, take in
