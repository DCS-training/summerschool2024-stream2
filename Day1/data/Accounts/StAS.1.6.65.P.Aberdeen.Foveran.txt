manure; large fields of sown grass and turnips are to be seen;
and considerable numbers of cattle are fed on these green
crops.  The grain usually is bear, oats, and pease.  On
two or three farms, wheat has been tried with success, which,
it may be presumed, will tend to promote its more general
cultivation.  Harvest begins about the middle or end of August.
-In the parish there are about 300 horses; 1500 cattle; and
an inconsiderable number of sheep; the nature of the soil and
the mode of agriculture generally pursued, not being favoura-
ble to the rearing of flocks.

   Trade and Manufactures.-The only trade that deserves
to be mentioned, carried on here, is the importation of lime,
coals, and wood, (with which last 3 or 4 vessels are commonly
freighted yearly from Norway or Garmouth;) and the exporta-
tion of grain and meal.  The demand for lime has, within the
last 7 years, increased in an astonishing degree:  at least 30 car-
goes having been imported this year.  It is only about 26 years
since the first cargo of that valuable species of manure, which
was given gratis by one of the heritors to his tenants, in order
to convince them of its advantages, was imported into this
parish.
   The stocking manufacture is carried on here, by the Aber-
deen merchants, to a considerable extent; but since the im-
provements which have taken place in the stocking looms, the
price of knitting them as fallen so low, that the women who
continue to knit can with difficulty earn a scanty subsistence.
As the practice of sowing lint begins to gain ground in this
country, it is hoped that the spinning of linen, by which a
good deal more can be earned, will likewise gradually pre-
vail*.
