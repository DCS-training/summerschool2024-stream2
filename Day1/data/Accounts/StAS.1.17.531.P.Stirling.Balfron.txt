houses, which were occupied as soon as they were covered
in, and plastered.
   The soil is various.  In some places it is light and sandy,
but, for the most part, wet and tilly.
   Agriculture is here in a state of infancy.  The principal,
corn crop is oats.  Barley is raised but in few places; and,
green crops are seldom attempted.  Among the disadvan-
tages that have hitherto retarded agricultural improvements,
may be reckoned the badness of the roads, the distance from
foreign manure, and especially the poverty of the greater
part of the farmers to whom the land is at present lot, in
very small portions.  Their rents are from 5 l. to 35 l.; two
or three of them about 70 l.; and one only up to 100 l.

hitherto laboured, are now in the way of being removed, or
sufficiently compensated, by the extraordinary advantages
arising from some new manufacturing establishments; and,
in as far as their influence has hitherto extended, to improve-
ments in agriculture, as soil has appeared very susceptible
of melioration.  There is abundant reason, indeed, for sup-
posing, that a spirit for such improvements will not be difficult
to excite; for, of late, many substantial inclosures have been
made in different parts of the parish, and particularly on the
estate of Ballindalloch, where, in addition to these, there
have been, several plantations of wood formed, with an equal
regard to beauty and utility.

   Manufactures, etc.-About the beginning of the year
1789, Robert Dunmore, Esq; of Ballindalloch, introduced
a colony of cotton weavers into the parish.  For these, he,
at first, built a few houses, at his own expence, in the neigh-
bourhood of the church, and let them out at a small yearly
rent.  This branch of manufacturer was immediately carried.
