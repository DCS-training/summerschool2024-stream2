it was made in the year 1534, for Nicholas Ramsay, the grandfa-

	Modern Buildings.--The only modern buildings worthy of remark
are the quay at Portlogan, erected by the late proprietor of Logan,
at a very considerable expense; and the Light-house, erected a
few years ago, at the extreme point of the Mull of Galloway. Ves-
sels bound from the English coast to the north sometimes mis-
took the Bay of Luce for the Channel, and did not discover their
mistake till they were aground on the sands at its head, where it
is not always practicable to get off. This mistake, except in very
foggy weather, the light effectually prevents.

	The inhabitants who are descended from native ancestors are
rather remarkable for size and strength. This was said to have
been conspicuous, when the Kirkmaiden company of volunteers was
reviewed along with those of other parishes. The habits of the
people with regard to the cleanliness of their cottages, cannot be
much commended. There is little peculiar in their dress. The
home-spun linsey woolsey gown, and blue cloth coat, are still pro-
duced by a few thrifty housewives; and although linen webs are

Logan was being built, where upwards of 2OO people, not belonging to the parish, were
employed.
