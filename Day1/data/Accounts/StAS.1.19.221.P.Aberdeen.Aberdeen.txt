     of Aberdeen.

fishermen are employed on the rivers.  Their wages, at an
average, are from L. 5 to L. 15 per annum.
   The grilses come into our rivers about the middle or end
of June, and continue till September.  These may gene-
rally be bought at about 2 d. or about 2 1/2 d. per pound.-
The fish caught in July, August, and September, are salted
and exported.
   The white trout and finnocks caught in the salmon-fishers
nets are excellent.  They belong as a perquisite to the fisher-
men, by whom they are sold at about 2 d. per pound, and
sometimes at a lower rate, to the inhabitants of both the
town and neighbourhood.  Many finnocks are caught in
the Don by small feeths, which the fishermen set for that
purpose after the season of the salmon-fishing is over.  It
is thought that these feeths do not tend to prevent the sal-
mon from coming up the river to spawn; because they are
too small in the mashes for entangling large fishes, and be-
cause they are never so far extended into the river as to
hinder them from passing.

   Nail Manufacture.-The chief branch of the iron manu-
facture carried on here is the making of nails.  This work
was established about the year 1780, and employs from 20
to 30 hands, who earn very high wages.  Other branches
of the iron manufacture might now, that the coal-duty is
taken-off, be carried on here to advantage.

   Distilleries.-The small stills in Aberdeen and its neigh-
bourhood were lately either given up, or removed to the
Highland districts.  All the whisky made in such stills is
liable to be seized as smuggled goods when brought to
Aberdeen; so that the city depends entirely on the large
distilleries in the south of Scotland for supplies of whisky.
