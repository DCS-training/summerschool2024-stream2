of Cove, upon the banks of Kirtle, of about 40 or 45
acres, and consisting in general of oak, has been twice cut
within the space of 53 years; and besides many occasional
advantages arising from weedings of small wood, at differ-
ent times, left the proprietor near L. 600.  Upon the estate of
Springkell, lying within this parish, there are many thri-
ving strips, clumps, &c. consisting of Scots, spruce, silver,
and balm of Gilead firs, larix, oak, ash, birch, and va-
rious other barren timber:  Not less than 150 acres of these
have been planted by the present Sir William Maxwell since
1761.  Upon the estates of Mossknow, Allerbeck and
Langshaw, are upwards of 50 acres of thriving clumps,
strips, &c. which do honour to the judgment and taste
of the several proprietors, and have rendered a place of the
country, formerly bare and bleak, one of the most pleasant
spots in Annandale.

   Soil.-The soil varies exceedingly; and soils which ap-
pear in other respects much the same, become more or less
valuable from the bottoms upon which they lie.  In many
parts, it consists of a strong red earth, with a large mixture
of sand, to a considerable depth; which, when lying upon
a gravelly bottom, as is generally the case along the side
of the river, is deservedly esteemed land of the first quali-
ty; and when under proper culture, and good management,
produces the most luxuriant crops of every kind.  A soil
nearly the same, but more shallow, is frequently to be met
with, upon a bottom inclining to clay and gravel, which,
though land of an inferior quality, is perhaps to the far-
mer equally valuable as the former; though less capable
of producing crops of wheat, it is easier cultivated and
managed, and generally yields crops of every other kind,
in equal abundance.  The same kind of earth, with a very
small mixture of sand, frequently makes its appearance
