The infield is usually divided into three parts; one third is
dunged for bear, after that produces two crops of oats, and
is then dunged again for bear, without being allowed to rest.
The other two thirds are always sown with oats, except a
little that is planted with potatoes, which make a part of the
ordinary diet of the family for two or three months in the
beginning of winter.  Every farm has at least ten outfield
solds, sometimes more, besides faughs; one half of these out-
fields are always in tillage, producing commonly five, never
less than four, successive crops of oats; after which they are
left out to rest in succession.  The fold which has rested five
years is made what is called a tothfold, that is to say, it is sur-
rounded with an earthen fence of a slight kind, but sufficient
to keep in both black cattle and sheep three or four hours
every day about noon, and the whole of every night from
the end of May until the crop is got in.  In autumn, this
fold with the dung upon it is ploughed up; and, being sown
with oats next spring, produces a luxuriant crop, and a still
better the second year, when the soil is more broke and re-
duced, and better mixed with the dung.  Even the third crop
of oats is tolerable, but the fourth is poor, and the fifth still
worse.  The faughs are a part of the outfield never dunged,
and yet carry usually five crops of oats, and never less than
four, when in tillage, the other half of them is always in lee,
but the crops, both of oats and grass which they produce, are
enerally poor indeed.  No marl of any kind has yet been
discovered in this district, nor any lime quarry; so that the
only manure is animal dung, and the ashes of peas or turf.
However, the importation of lime shells, both from the Frith
of Forth and from Sunderland, (a boll of the former yield-
ing two bolls and a half, and of the latter three bolls of pow-
dered lime,) being now carried on to a great extent; the far-
mers begin to bring out shells in small quantities, and this,
