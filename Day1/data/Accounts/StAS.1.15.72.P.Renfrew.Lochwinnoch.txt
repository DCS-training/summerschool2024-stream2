   Longevity.-MARGARET PATTON, who was born in this
parish, is mentioned by Lynch on health, as a remarkable in-
stance of longevity.  Her picture and a print from it, which
the writer of this account has seen, were done from the life,
by J. Cooper in 1739, with the following inscription: "Mar-
"garet Patton, born in the parish of Loghnugh, near Paisley
"in Scotland, living in the work-house of St Margarets,
"Westminster, aged 138 year."

   Rent and Properties.-The valued rent of the parish is
6692 L. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch, and the real rent about 7600 L. Ster-
ling.  Mr M'Dowall is proprietor of a considerable part of
parish and the remainder holds of him as superior,
with a few exceptions.  The other proprietors amount to
120, and the uncommon number of them seems to have a-
risen, from the seus granted by the families of Dundonald
and Semple, who were formerly proprietors of the greater
part of this parish.  They reside in general in the parish, mar-
ry into each other's families, and cultivate their own property,
