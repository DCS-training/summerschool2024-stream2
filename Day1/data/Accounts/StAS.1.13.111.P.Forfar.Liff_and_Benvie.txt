not above a dozen of fifteen may be said to be kept for
convenience, or for any purpose but that of husbandry.
Very few horses are bred here of in the country around,
and accordingly their price has advanced beyond all former
expectation.  Forty pounds Sterling is now considered as a 
very moderate price for a pair of ordinary cart-horses, and
they are seldom to be had for less than fifty.  Milch cows a
