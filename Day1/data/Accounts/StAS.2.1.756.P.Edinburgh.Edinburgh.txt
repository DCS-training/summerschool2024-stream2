   The North British Railway, a line along the sea coast from
Newcastle, is at present in progress, and will join the Glasgow
railway at the mutual terminus, North Bridge.
   Mail and Stage Coaches.-The number of these which leave
Edinburgh for the various routes amounts to 90.
   Hackney Coaches.-The number of hackney coaches, cabs, and
comnibuses licensed to ply in Edinburgh is 200.
   Edinburgh Water Company.-In 1621 an act of the Scottish
Parliament empowered the Edinburgh town-council to bring in
water to the city; and gave them liberty to cast "seuchs and ditches"
in the lands through which the springs behoved to pass. No mea-
sures, however, were taken to carry this act into execution till the
year 1674, when the magistrates employed a German plumber, at
an expense of L. 2950 Sterling, to bring water in a leaden pipe of
three inches diameter from Comiston springs to a reservoir on
the Castle Hill. In 1722 a pipe of 4 1/2 inches diameter was laid;
but the city continuing to increase in size, the supply of water was
found to be very scanty; and in 1787 a cast-iron pipe of 5 inches
diameter was added. In 1790 additional springs were procured
at Swanston, and three miles farther south, and a pipe of 9 inches
bore was laid at an expense to the city of Edinburgh of L. 20,000.
Hitherto the expense had been defrayed by the town-council, al-
though several unsuccessful attempts had been made to assess the
inhabitants. The supply of water still continuing insufficient for
the increasing population, a new water Company was formed, and
incorporated by act of Parliament in 1818. A capital was raised
by shares of L. 25 each, the magistrates, as the representatives of
the community, holding shares to the amount of L. 30,000, for
their right in the new Company. The capital was at first limited
to L. 135, 000, but in 1826, by a new act, was extended to
L. 253,000. By these acts, every tenant is assessed in the sum of
10d. per pound on four-fifths of his rent, as rated in the police
books.
