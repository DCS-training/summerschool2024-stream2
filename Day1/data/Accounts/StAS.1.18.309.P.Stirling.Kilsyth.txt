ordinary age.  The season of this may be, that a numerous
family of children all idle, necessarily became burdensome;
whereas now every child, male or female, above 6 years of
age, can find employment; and a numerous thriving family
is a great support to a sober industrious tradesman.
   The common utensils of a family are very different from
what they were 50 years ago.  At that period, there were
no tea kettles, tea dishes, bellow, nor watches, and very
few clocks.  Now, every family can furnish these articles.
There were few spinning wheels, still fewer check reels; in
place of these, the rock and hand reel were used.  There
were no lint nor barley milns; of courses the lint was dressed
at home, in each family; and the barley bruised in a stone
mortar.  Every farmer had his own kiln for drying his corns.
A common kiln is now erected near each miln, where every
farmer gets his grain dried at 6 d per boll.  There were no
carts nor wheel carriages of any kind.  All the grain was
carried on horseback, or in harvest, upon sledges or cars.
   Indeed the roads were at that time so steep, narrow, and
rugged, that wheel carriages must have been almost useless.
The line of the roads was generally straight, or nearly so,
over hill and dale; or if they deviated from this course at
any time, it was only to avoid some marsh, or to find a firm
bottom.  They seem to have thought of little else, at least
they never dreamed of a level road.  Now the roads are
good, and carts and wheel carriages of all kinds abound.
   But the most remarkable changes have taken place in the
course of 25 years.  The introduction of manufactures, and
the great canal, have been the principal causes of them.
   The species of manufactures most run upon is the muslin.
Some of these are only a 1000, others 1700, and even 2000
reed; and of every species. There are at least 350 hands
thus employed. Supposing each hand to work 3 yards per
