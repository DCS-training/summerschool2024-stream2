when the ground has been thus properly prepared, that
the result has not been a very abundant crop.  There
may be from 100 to 150 acres of wheat, sown annually in
this way, the produce of which is, from 1000 to 1200
bolls.  Such, either is the richness of the soil, in some
parts of this parish, or the advantage of this mode of ma-
nagement, that an exceeding good crop of oats, has been
obtained after the wheat, without any interval or addi-
tional manure.  After this, the ground is either allowed
to rest some time, of the same process is repeated without
intermission.  This is pretty much the practice, pursued by
the farmer, in the lower parts of the parish, which includes
by far its most fertile and populous division.  Those, also,
in the immediate neighbourhood of Glasgow, make a good
deal by sending in their milk as it comes from the cow.
The lands, at a greater distance from town, and those of
an inferior quality, are, in general, plowed to the extent
of one third, and nothing is raised in them but oats, and a 
little barley.  In these places, the farmer chiefly depends
upon the produce of his dairy.  Here, as well as in the
parishes at a greater distance in the same direction, the
country people find great advantage in sending their but-
ter-milk to Glasgow, during the summer season, and it
proves a cheap and wholesome beverage, to the lower
classes of the inhabitants, of that great and populous city.

   Manufactures.-Although the bulk of the inhabitants,
as above stated, are employed in husbandry, yet there are
some persons of other occupations among them.  At pre-
sent, there are 30 looms for weaving in the parish, which
chiefly find employment from the manufacturers of Glas-
gow.-A considerable bleachfield was occupied for some
time, by a Company in Glasgow, who carry on the ma-
nufacture of stockings to a great extent.  But is being com-
