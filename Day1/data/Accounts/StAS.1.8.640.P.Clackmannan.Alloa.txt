Admiralty Court at Edinburgh, at a very considerable expense.
Besides, a most serious injury seems likely to arise, from the
shipmasters casting their ballast into the river, without any
court to check them; which, in process of time, must inter-
rupt the navigation, and hurt the public as well as individuals.
It is thought, that an admiral court would speedily put a stop
to this complaint.

   Services. etc.-All kinds of personal services from tenants
may be said to be abolished as those on the estate of Tulli-
body are seldom or never exacted*.  The feuers in the town
are obliged to turn out, in cafe of any accident at the dam-

affected by any inundation.  The family of MARR were found
by the Court of Session, after a long litigation, to have a right
to draw custom for goods passing through the towm, as they
were obliged to keep up the streets, etc.

   Roads.-The statute labour for the roads, is, as in other
places, under the direction of the justices of the peace.  The
cotter's labour is converted into money, and sometimes the
farmer's carriages.  The country, for some time past, has been
amused with schemes for turnpike roads; and perhaps this
has occassioned a remissness in the exaction of the statue work.

tilleries were flourishing, the roads are exceedingly bad.  It

done the same with the multure of the malt, from the brewers in the barony of
Alloa; but as that was in such a number of hands, and these continually chang-
ing, he found it impracticable.  The brewers strongly litigated the point about
20 years ago.  It was at length decided in favour of the proprietor.
