   Heritors and Rent.-There are 3 heritors, but none of
them reside in the parish.  About 30 years ago, the land
rent of Lundie was superior to that of Foulis; but the case
is now reversed, which may be owing to the long leases or
liferent tacks granted, by which the principal heritor of the
former parish has not had it in his power to inclose and im-
prove the ground, whereby the greater part of it is still in its
natural state.  The difference between the rent of Lundie
and that of Foulis cannot be stated with precision; the for-
mer is reckoned not much under 1000 L; and some idea of
the advance of rent may be formed from one farm, which, in
1642, was let at 50 merks Scotch, but is now esteemed a
good bargain at 100 L. Sterling.

   Agriculture, Produce, and Cattle.-The chief productions
are barley, oats, potatoes, and flax.  There is more of this
last article raised here than at Foulis, but not so much artifi-
cial grass.  Several farmers have tried the culture of wheat,
but have all given it up, except one.  The seed time for oats
is from the 1st of March; for barley, about the 20th of
May; and for wheat, from the middle of September to the
end of October.  Considerable quantities of oats, barley, and
oat-meal, are exported, besides supplying the inhabitants.
The crop is somewhat later than at Foulis.-There are 140
horses, and 364 cattle; 28 ploughs, chiefly of the construc-
tion recommended by Mr James Small, in his Treatise on

good performer.  But he had hardly played a single tune,
when, hearing his music distinctly repeated three times over, he
got up in great terror, averring that the Devil was certainly in
the place; that he had never before engaged with Satan, and
he was determined he never would again; whereupon he broke
his pipe in pieces, and could never afterwards be prevailed upon
to play any more.
