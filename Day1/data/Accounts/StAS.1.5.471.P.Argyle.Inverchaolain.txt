The only epidemical diseases, by which we are infected,
are fevers, (which cut off many); the small pox, in the
natural way, and the measles, which prove fatal to num-
bers of children.-Inoculation for the small pox, though
not universal, is becoming more general among the lower
classes of people.  The few, that die of inoculation, in com-
