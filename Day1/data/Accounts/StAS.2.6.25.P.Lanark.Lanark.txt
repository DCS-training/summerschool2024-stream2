is in the hands of the Crown; but from the time of Charles II. it
had been claimed by the family of Lee. The Laird of Lee, in
1748, granted a presentation in favour of the Rev. Robert Dick,
one of the most pious and learned ministers ever belonging to the
church of Scotland, the king presenting at the same time the Rev.
James Gmy. The people, unjustly prejudiced against the former
presentee, tumultuously opposed his induction, for which several of
them were tried. The civil question of right was at that time
brought before the Court of Session, and decided in favour of, the
Laird of Lee; but, upon an appeal to the House of Lords, this
decision was reversed, and the Crown has since exercised the pa-
tronage.
	The parish church is situated in the middle of the town, and
is in so far convenient for the large majority of the population, al-
though a few families residing at the extremities of the parish may
be between four and five miles distant from it. It was built in
1774. For many years back it bad been in a very dilapidated
state. During last autumn, however, it underwent considerable
repairs, by which it has been greatly improved. *
	Elegant silver communion cups were anciently presented to the
church by the Laird of Lee. Lady Ross Baillie likewise present-
ed the church with a handsome baptismal bason, a clock, and a
pair of stoves, and in other ways also contributed to its comfort.
	By the original contract, the church should have been seated to
accommodate 2300 persons. But such a number would scarcely
find room. There are about 100 free sittings, and these might
easily be increased, if necessary, by benches along the passages.
	The manse was built in 1757. It received repairs and an addi-
tion in 1811, and is now in a tolerably comfortable state.
