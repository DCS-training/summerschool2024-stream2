<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
	By return to Dr Webster in 1755, the population was     386,
        By census in               1811,                        535
                    		   1821,			527
                                   1831,                        485
        By a census taken by the present incumbent in 1834,     455

   This diminution of population since the year 1821 is to be at-
tributed to the death of the late Mr Robertson of Ladykirk, who
gave employment to numerous labourers, in improving and beauti-
fying his property, and also to the numbers who have emigrated
to Canada.
   There are residing in the village of Horndene, 128; in Upset-
lington, 111.
   The only family of independent fortune residing in the parish
is that of Mr Robertson of Ladykirk.
