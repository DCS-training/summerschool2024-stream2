may be stated at L. 2 an acre; more or less, according to
circumstances.  Good land, which is not of Carse quality,
is also let at a very high rent; but in some parts of the
parish, where the soil is poor, wet, and spungy, the value
of the acre is very small.
   In the Carse, the crops of grain and hay are so luxuriant
and productive, that the farmers have but a small portion
of their land in pasture; and of course they have no more
cattle than are necessary for the family and the farm.
   The rotation of farming in the Carse of Falkirk consists
in general of six parts: First, the ground is fallowed; se-

of grass for hay, the seeds of which had been sown the pre-
ceding year with the barley; and sixthly, it is sown with
oats.
   The valued rent of the parish, by which the land-tax,
parish assessments, etc. are paid, is L. 13,521: 8: 6 Scotch

riod, the rental cannot now be less than L. 9000.  House-
rents are not taken into the account in either of the above
valuations.

Thames into the York-buildings, for supplying a part of
the city of London.  The affairs of that Company having

Court of Session; and those of Callander and Almond
