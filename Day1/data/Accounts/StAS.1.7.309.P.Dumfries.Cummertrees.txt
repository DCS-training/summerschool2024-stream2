when fat, sold to dealers, who cure and export their carcases.

   Price of Provisions, Labour, etc.-The average price of oat-
meal, for these 7 years past, has been 20 d. per stone; the
price of barley, during that period, has not been lower than
6 s. nor higher than 10 s. 6 d. per Carlisle bushel; the me-

quantities of oat-meal are annually exported to Greenock
and the west coast; and all the barley, except the small por-

pool market, where oats are frequently sent.  Considerable
quantities of potatoes are also exported.  Grain is shipped at

per annum, besides maintenance.  They are all hired from
half year to half year; and the late increase of wages may be
imputed to the vicinity of England, where they are still
higher, and where many of the servants in the lower part of
Annandale frequently engage themselves.  The wages of
day-labourers, employed in hedging or ditching, are 1 s. and
sometimes 1 s. 2 d. per day without victuals; masons and
joiners have 1 s. 6 d. per day.

   Roads.-The military road, from Portpatrick to Gretna,
made at the expence of government, intersects the southern

funds arising from the composition of the statute not being
sufficient for preserving it, the trustees for the high-roads
made an application to Parliament for an act to erect turn-
