of Ellon, L.1, 0s. 8d. from the lands of Ordefork, and L.2 from
tenements in the Gallowgate and Green of Aberdeen.-(Fyvie
Chart.)   In this parish, indeed, the external machinery for the sup-
port of the Roman Catholic faith, appears to have been very com-
plete, as there had, at least, been six or seven places of worship,
or other Popish endowments connected with it.  While, of late
years, we have experienced a share of the great benefits of the
scheme of Church Extension, on which the Reformed Presbye-
rian Church of Scotland has now so happily entered, on the whole,
as compared with former times, we have to remark a serious Church
Contraction here.
   The earliest Protestant incumbent of Fyvie whom we have seen
mentioned is Mr George Sharpe, 1651 to 1663.  Since that pe-
riod the following have been ministers:-Mr William Jaffray,
from 1654 to 1676; Mr George Scott, 13th July 1720 to
George Dalgardno, 1685 to 1717; Mr Robert Hay, 1st May
1718 to 1st July 1719; Mr Thomas Scott, 13th July 1720 to
3d July 1748; Mr William Moir, 27th April 1749 to 19th March
1794; Mr John Falconer, 3d December 1794 to 19th December
1828. John Manson, the preeent incumbent of the parish, was
ordained July 7th 1829.
   Burgh of Fyvie.-In course of the recent search among the
papers at Fyvie Castle, a rather interesting discovery has been
made, bearing upon the early history of the parish, of certain do-
cuments relative to a burgh of Fyvie.  Tradition concerning it
had been lost, nor can the site of it now be distinctly fixed, but
from an early period mention is made of it.  In the Brieve of King
Robert Bruce in 1325, for fixing marches, already referred to, the
rights of the burgesses of "our burgh of Fyvie," in the peat-moss
of Ardlogie, are directed to be ascertained; and the finding of the
assize refers to the privileges of these burgesses in the time of
Reginald le Chen, between 1250 ancl the end of the century.
From 1390 downwards, the "Villa seu burgum de Fyvie," with
its customs, and burgh-mails, is regularly found in the char-
ters of the Fyvie property.  It has been supposed to have been a
royal burgh, but no charter of erection is known, though, from the
circumstances of the Fyvie property continuing a royal demesne till
towards the close of the fourteenth century, and the king being
thus the immediate superior of the burgh, perhaps it may have
some claim to the above distinction.  It, however, unquestionably
became a Burgh of Barony," of which the proprietors of Fyvie
