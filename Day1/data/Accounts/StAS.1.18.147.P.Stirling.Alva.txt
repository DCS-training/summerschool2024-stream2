few, if any, of the trees, either in the parishes on the east
or west, are equal either in age or size, to the trees of this
parish.
   Few situations afford more ample scope for the display of
elegance and taste, in the way of rural ornament, than this
place presents.  Nature is seen here in some of her grandest,
as well as most pleasing forms; and a correct taste, by lop-
ping off some luxuriancies, and bestowing some additional
touches, where these are requisite, might contribute great-
ly to heighten the beauty of the scenery.  A rivulet of the
purest water, pours along the middle of that glen where the
mines were wrought; when obstructed in its course by op-
posing rocks, it forces its way, and falls in three beautiful
cascades; where the ground is soft and flat, it forms a capa-
cious pool; it is shaded on both its banks, with an extensive
plantation of thriving timber, and forms a convenient recess
for the purpose of bathing.  Even Diana herself, with all
her attendant nymphs, might here boldly plunge into the
cool "translucent wave," and not dread the unhallowed eve
of any savage or licentious intruder.

   IN the east end of the church, a monument, plain, and
without ornament, is erected by Lord Alva, in memory of
his father, late Lord Justice Clerk.  The following Epitaph
is inscribed on a marble plate, which, for classic elegance,
and purity of stile, is surpassed perhaps by few modern com-
positions of that kind.  It is hoped, that it may not be
disagreeable to the few surviving friends of that respect-
able and truly amiable man, to recognize a character in
which they delighted, thus elegantly and justly described by
his son.
