degrees of respectability in the parish ; of which 91 are in
the town, and 5 in the villages of Raplocb and Abbey. Some
of these, no doubt, are necessarv ; but, to such an amount, they are
the source of mucb evil. Many of them are of the worst descrip-
tion ; , receptacles for the vilest characters, giving facility, and hold-
ing out temptation, to drunkenness, profligacy, profanation of the
Sabbath, and the many vices which follow in their train. They
have a most injurious influence on the morals of the lower orders :
they give grievous offence and scandal to those members of the
community who have better tastes and principles, when they bear,
and that often on the Sabbath, the sound of revelry proceeding
from them, and witness in their neighbourbood the revolting scenes
to which they give rise ; they tend to lower the tone and feeling
of the mass of the inhabitants in relation to the virtues sobriety
and decency, and the sacredness of the day of rest; and they re-
flect discredit on the place where such practices prevail, and such
depravity is exhibited. One pregnant cause of this evil is the
readiness of the owners of houses to allow them to be occupied in
this way for the sake of obtaining a higher rent, without regard to
the mischievous use to be made of their property. Another is the
granting of licenses, without sufficient inquiry as to the character
of the applicant, and the moral expediency of planting down, or
continuing, for the mere purpose of sordid traffic and gain to an
individual, what may prove a powerful Stimulant to crime, and a
pest to the community. The effect produced by the great num-
ber of low tippling-houses, and the facility with which almost the
smallest pittance in the hand of a poor person can be exchanged
for ardent spirits at a grocer's shop, in increasing the number of
the destitute, and sinking them into deeper wretchedness, has been
for a long period forcing itself upon the notice of every real friend
to the moral welfare of the poor. There are, no doubt, other
causes to which the growing pauperism may be traced; and some
of these, perhaps, to a certain extent, peculiar to Stirling. One
which ought not to pass without remarks is the great number of
charitable institutions, on which so large a portion of the people
have a claim, training them to a species of pauperism ; but no one
can entertain a doubt that the circumstance I have been endea-
vouring to illustrate, is one of the main and most malignant foun-
tains of the great and spreading evil.
