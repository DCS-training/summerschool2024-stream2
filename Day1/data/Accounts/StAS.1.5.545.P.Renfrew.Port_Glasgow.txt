it, together with a few farms in its immediate vicinity, e-
rected into a separate parish in the year 1695, by the name
of New Port-Glasgow, i. e. the new port of Glasgow, by
which name it has been invariably known ever since.

   Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.-This parish is situa-
ted within the bounds of the presbytery of Paisley, and
Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  It is nearly an English mile
square.-The land in this parish is partly flat and partly
mountainous.  Along the coast, and for about 130 yards
back, it is nearly a dead level, little higher than the high
water mark.  This flat part, except that on which the
town stands, is at present entirely converted into garden
ground, belonging to the inhabitants, who sued it from the
proprietor of the lands in the parish; and although the soil
was originally barren, and in some place very shallow, yet
it is astonishing what happy effects cultivation has produ-
ced; all kinds of pot herbs and common fruits, both small
and big, being now raised here, of the richest quality, and
in the greatest abundance.  Immediately behind the flat
part of the parish, there are mountains considerably steep
and high, mostly of a poor soil, a small part of which is in
tillage, and the rest in pasture.

   Climate, etc.-The air of the parish is moist, owing, it
is supposed, to its vicinity to the river Clyde, to the many
lochs, which lie between the mountains on the opposite coast
of Argyleshire, and to the peninsular form of this west
country in general.  Upon a comparison, between the rope-
work books of this place and those of Glasgow, when that
branch of manufacture was carried on in the open air, it has
been found, that the inhabitants of the former place have,
at an average, about 14 days more rain in the year, than
those of the latter.  Notwithstanding this, New Port-
