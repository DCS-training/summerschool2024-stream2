no less than sixty stage-coaches monthly, or fifteen every week,
and they reached the capital in four days:-And, in 1786,
two of these stage-coaches, (which set out daily), reached Lon-
don in sixty hours, by the same road that required twelve or
sixteen days for the established coach in 1763*.
   In 1763-The hackney-coaches in Edinburgh were few in
number, and perhaps the worst of the kind in Britain.
   In 1783-The number of hackney-coaches was more than
tripled, and they were the handsomest carriages, and had the
best horses for the purpose, of any without exception, in
Europe.  In 1790, many elegant hackney-chariots were added.
There are no other of the kind in Britain that ply the streets+.
   In 1783-Triple the number of merchants, physicians, sur-
geons, etc. kept their own carriages, that ever did in any for-
mer period; and the number is since increased.
   In 1783-Several presbyterian ministers in Edinburgh, and
Professors in the Universtity, kept their own carriages; a cir-

unequalled in any former period of the history of the Church,
or of the University.
   In 1763-Literary property, or authors acquiring money
by their writings. was hardly known in Scotland:  David

*A person may now set out on Sunday afternoon after divine service from
Edinburgh to London; may stay a whole day in London, and he again in E-
dinburgh on Saturday at six in the morning.  The distance from Edinburgh
to London is 400 miles.-Forty years ago, it was common for people to
make then will, before setting out on a London journey.

+One hackney-coach lately cost a hundred guineas, and the two horses
eighty guineas.
