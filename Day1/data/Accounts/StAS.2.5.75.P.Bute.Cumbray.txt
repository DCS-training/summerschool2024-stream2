of Millport now stands; the family name was Stewart. Pen-
machrie, on the lands of which the village of the Sheriff's
Auld Haw once stood; the family name here also was Stewart.
Ballykellet, which seems to have been the most considerable of
the whole; the family name was Montgomerie; the last male
survivor was Sir Robert. With the exception of the Kames, the
Hill, and Craigengour, all of which were but small properties, this
family seems to have possessed all that part of the island which
now belongs to Lord Glasgow, together with the patronage of the
parish. Part of this ancient mansion-house was still standing in
1837, was then in tolerably good repair, and was, at that time,
occupied by a farmer; but since then it has been removed, in
order to make way for some improvements on the farm. The fa-
mily arms, cut out in one entire stone, with the family motto, Garde
bien at the head, and the names of both the proprietors, Sir Ro-
bert Montgomerie, and Dame Margaret Douglas at the foot,
still served to ornament the front of the old parish church till
1837, when the church was rebuilt, and when, of course, that an-
cient stone was removed, and it now occupies a corner in the manse
garden. The last of this family of whom anything is known
was Dame Margaret Montgomerie, daughter of the above Sir
Robert, who was killed on the green at Largs by the horse on
which she rode, which first threw her, and then struck her with
his foot, which instantly caused her death. Near to this site,
there is a large stone set up on end, upwards of 6 feet in height,
besides what is sunk in the earth, which stone most probably marks
the last retreat of some ancient hero. On tbe lands of this ba-
rony, there has been lately erected a mill for grinding corn.
There is no other building in the parish that deserves to be par-
ticularly mentioned.
