families; and in few provincial towns are the inhabitants
more distinguished for general information, social intercourse,
and urbanity of manners.
   In their general conduct they are both "pitiful and cour-
teous;" deserving the praise of beneficence to the poor,
and hospitality to strangers.
   The author of this report has had frequent opportunities
of remarking their liberal and ready spirit to do good, and
their willingness to communicate to every judicious and
disinterested charity.
   In their attendance on the ordinances of divine institution,
all ranks are highly regular and exemplary.
   Such laudable attention to external observances, so pre-
valent here, and so generally remarked in the different
Statistical Reports, though not a certain criterion, is at least
a strong presumption, of the existence of internal religion
among us.  It is a truth, for the confirmation of which we
may appeal to living history, and to the conduct of a neigh-
bouring nation, that the decay of outward forms of worship
precedes the decay of the more "weighty matters of the
" law, justice, mercy, faith," and leads to the dissolution of
all the "charities of father, son, and brother."
   In our present imperfect state, there is certain danger of
religion gliding by degrees from the heart, unless invigorat-
ed by external ordinances, by a due observance of the Sab-
bath, by stated calls to worship, and the salutary influence
of example.
   That disagreement in religious opinions, which generally
obtains in every numerous society, is here attended with no
personal hatred, or rancorous animosity.  We differ quietly,
and in general maintain that meekness and moderation
which found reason approves, and Christian charity com-
mands.
