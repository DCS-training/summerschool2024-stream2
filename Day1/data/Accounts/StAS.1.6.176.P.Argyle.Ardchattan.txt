   Natural Productions.-The soil is light and dry, except in
a very few instances.  The arable land, when properly culti-
vated, and allowed time to rest for some respite to recover it-
self, produces excellent crops of oats, barley, and potatoes, of
a choice quality.  But short leafes, and the promiscuoos mode
of letting victual farms to several tenants, without assigning to
each his due proportion of arable ground throw a damp upon
the efforts of industry, and prevent the improvements which
would otherwise be introduced.  Whereas, by adopting the
contrary practice, a spirit of emulation would be excited, the
lands cultivated to more advantage than they are at present,
and a much greater number would be supported by the pro-
duce.  But it must be acknowledge that a remarkable alte-
ration for the better, as to agriculture, has taken place within
these few years; and the parish of Ardchattan would produce
sufficient, for the maintenance of its inhabitants, if the te-
nants reserved their barley for their own use, but they always
sell it to brewers, as it fetches a high price.  This is not the
case with the parish of Muckairn.  About 1753, a company
from Lancashire erected a furnace for casting pig-iron, in its
vicinity, and obtained a long leafe of several farms for rearing
wood and grazing their work-horses.  These lie waste and un-
cultivated; and occasion the importation of a considerable
quantity of meal into that district.  The crops raised here are
oats, barley, potatoes, and a small quantity of pease.  Hemp
and flax are cultivated only for private use.  A few sow rye-
grass and clover, which yield ample returns.-The manures
used here are lime, shell-sand, sea-weeds, and dung.-The
Scotch plough is generally used, being well adapted to the
soil.-There are 53 ploughs and 100 carts in this district.
