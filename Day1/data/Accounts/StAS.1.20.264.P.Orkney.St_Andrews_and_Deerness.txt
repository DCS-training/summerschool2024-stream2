without number.  The taiste, or black guillemote, builds
her nest in the cliffs; the kittewakes are by themselves, in
the east end of the rock, the whole surface of which they
render white, as that of the other end is mottled black and
white, by the auks, the scouts, the cormorants, the shags,
the gulls, &c. &c. which crowd upon every shelf.  The
people of this island get vast quantities of sea-fowls, eggs,
and feathers; which last they fell for 9 d. per lib.  The me-
thod of getting them is this:  A boy, having a rope tied
round his waist, is turned over the brink of the rock, quite
out of fight of those who support him, by holding in their
hands the end of the rope.  The boy, as soon as he comes
where the birds or eggs are, secures them; and, when load-
ed, informs those above, by signs which they mutually un-
derstand, how to direct the rope, when to lower, and when
to pull up.  He has a staff to defend him from the rugged
points and shelves.  A human being, suspended from the
top of a cliff 50 fathoms high, is, to a stranger, a dreadful
fight; but the rockmen, as they are properly and significant-
ly called, walk on the very edges of the shelves, in the very
face of the rock, with the greatest unconcern.

   Horses, Cattle, etc.-There are few horses bred in these
parishes, or in any part of Orkney, most of them being
brought from Caithness and Strathnaver, when a year old,
and are then called staigs.  A staig costs from five to twelve
guineas, and after being employed in the farm, and kept at
a considerable expence for four or five years, is sold again
to Caithness, at nearly the same price he was brought at.  The
number of horses in both parishes may be from 650 to 670.
The black-cattle are of a small and very unhandsome breed,
and are all reared in the parish.  There may be of them
from 900 to 1000.  Sheep run wild ont he moors and com-
mons; they are small, and much neglected, and the number
