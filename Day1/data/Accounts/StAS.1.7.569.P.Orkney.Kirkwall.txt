derable distance.  The stations most fit for this fishing seem
to be the town of Stromness, the islands of Stronsay and
Sanday, of Westray and Walls, at the last of which, the
little farmers on the shores of the Pentland Frith, in the
times they could spare from their labour on land, have been
known to catch 40,000 fine cod in the space of only one
season.  Before much can be made of it, however, skillful
fishers by profession must be procured, as well as boats
constructed for the purpose, and little sloops to cover them
from the rage of the sea, and the inclemency of the
weather.
   Besides all this, the inhabitants of Orkney are invited by
their circumstances and situation to engage in the seal and
whale fisheries.  An evident advantage they have in being
nearer the fishing ground than others, their seamen are as
good, and would serve for less wages, and their provisions
are still much cheaper than they are elsewhere; and as the
price of labour is not yet very high here, the spick or blub-
ber might, to great emolument, be converted into oil in this
country.  In fine, were they to improve their agriculture
in proportion to the goodness of the soil-were they to in-
crease their manufactures, and raise raw materials for them
at home, or even import them from abroad-and were
they wisely and vigorously to avail themselves of the advan-
tages of their situation for carrying on various sorts of fishe-
ries, and both foreign and domestic commerce, the people,
by means of that industry, the sweets of which they would
in that case taste, would in a short time become more nu-
merous and more happy, and the Orkney islands, by no
means inconsiderable either in point of extent or fertility,
would emerge from obscurity, and assume the character of a
respectable province, and add not only to the strength, but
the splendour of the British empire.
