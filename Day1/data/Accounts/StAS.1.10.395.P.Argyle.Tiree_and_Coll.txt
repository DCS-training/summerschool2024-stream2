ground, either arable, green mounts, or broken banks,
perhaps 40 or 50 feet high.  This sand, in course of time,
driven by the winds, and not prevented by a coat of sea-
weeds, or heavy earth, ascends into the interior parts, and
lays waste large tracks of ground.
   Though Coll consists also of low ground, it differs much
from Tiry.  The coast is bolder.  Not above a 16th part of
it is arable.  The inhabitants by industry make good crops
by delving.  Though rugged and unfriendly to the plough, it
affords excellent shelter for cattle.  A very considerable part
is heath, and mossy ground, partly convertible into arable.
It contains 48 small lakes, 19 of them abounding in trouts.
   The whole of Tiry and the two ends of Coll are the pro-
perty of the Duke of Argyle, who is also patron.  The middle
part of Coll (above two thirds of the island) is the property of
the Laird of Coll, who chiefly resides in the parish.  Tra-
dition says, that the whole property descended, from Mac-
donald of the Isles, to the Macleans  By marriage the Mac-
leans retained it till the family of Argyle obtained right to
the greatest part of Mull, Morven, and Tiry.  The real rent
of the parish is near 2000 L.

   Soil, Produce, Cultivation.-The soil of Tiry is various
sandy, mossy, clay, and black earth, with their different com-
positions.  The sandy soil prevails, and produces very poor
crops, except when very well manured.  If sown early, there
is danger of blowing; if late, of summer drought.  The
country being flat, even a short continuance of rain endangers
the vegetation in the lower grounds.  Two-thirds of the
whole arable ground are either too wet or too dry; and al-
most the whole surface is exposed to storms.  The returns,
communibus annis, are about 4 seeds from barely, and 2 1/2 from
small black oats (the prevailing sorts of grain) and about 5
