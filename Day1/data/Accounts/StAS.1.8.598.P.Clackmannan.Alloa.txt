mon are sometimes caught; as well as Congo eels, sturgeon,
soals, turbots, cod, gurnet, or piper, and skate.*-Sometimes,
about the end of September, there comes a vast shoal of fish,
called gandanooks, or Egyptian berrings.  They have a faint
resemblance of the mackarel, but with a long sharp bill, like
a snipe.  This becomes fatal to them on our muddy banks, as
the bill is fixed in the mud; and in this way they are entangled,
and caught in great quantities, on the ebbing of the tide.
They are not an unpleasant fish, but rather dry; they are
however a great relief to many poor people.  Porpoises now
and then appear here, and sometimes small whales have been
seen and taken+.

   Tullibody.-In proceeding up the river, we come to the
barony of Tullibody.  The house is let down in the Carse,
almost close to the water side.  Behind it, on the north,
there is a beautiful bank, well furnished with a variety
of fine trees; and on each hand of this bank, almost at
equal distances from the house, there are two prominences,
jutting out into the Carse, which seem to protect and shelter
the lower grounds.  The one on the east is covered with trees,
and the one on the west with some farm houses.

   Rivers, Fish, etc.-In the front of the boule is the river,
with two of the Inches formerly mentioned.  From this, up

*In September 1777, a skate, of the species of the sharp nosed ray, was
caught here, which was of a very large size.  The length, from the tip of the
nose to the end of the tail, was 7 feet 3 inches; the breadth, from the extremity
Of one fin to that of the other, 5 feet 3 inches; and it weighed 13 1/2 stones
Dutch weight, which is about 2 1/8 cwt. avoirdupoise.

+About 2 years ago, an angler, or fishing frog, was thrown ashore at the
Ferry.  It is a fish of a very uncommon appearance, resembling a frog in its
tadpole state.  They sometimes grow to a large size, and are thought to be a
great enemy to the dog fish.
