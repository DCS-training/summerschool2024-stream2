tatoes, of which great quantities are raised.  The parish,
however, never serves itself entirely, even in the best
years; and in bad seasons, great quantities of meal are
imported.  In summer 1791, upwards of 2000 bolls of
meal, besides potatoes, were imported.  That year was
much severer than summer 1783, and, together with
several bankruptcies that happened then, reduced the
inhabitants to great difficulties.  The year 1793 is pret-
ty plentiful; and though the Duke of Argyll, dread-
ing a scarcity, ordered meal to Mull, and to be ditribu-
ted at prime cost, yet such was the plenty in the parish,
that only the incumbent, and 2 or 3 other gentlemen up-
on his Grace's property in the parish, had any occasion
for it.  Perhaps, by a better mode of agriculture, the
parish might, in general, serve itself, particularly Ross
and the island of I.  The sowing begins generally about
the 20th of March, and is finished by the middle of
May, except the island of I, which is not over with the
barley sowing till after the middle of June:  But such is
the heat of the soil, that they cut down their crop ear-
lier than any part of the rest of the parish.  In good
seasons, the crop is cut down in September:  In bad seasons,
some of the crop has not been cut down till November.

   Manure and Mode of Cultivation.-The different kinds
of manure made use of through the parish, are shell sand,
with which Ross abounds, dung from the housed cattle,
and sea ware, of which mention is made already.  Cattle
also lie upon some field in every farm in summer and
harvest, which is called teathing; and where ferns are
found, they are laid upon the fields in July and August.
As there are no cart roads in the parish, the manure is 
laid out upon the ground in creels upon horseback,
