			III.--POPULATION.
	The state of the population of this parish at an early period can-
not be given with certainty, as no record of it has been kept; but
there is satisfactory evidence to shew that it has tripled within less
than a century:--
		 Population in 1791, 	     1518
                                 1811,            2526
                                 1821,            3200
                                 1831,            3595 inclusive of seamen.

	The constant employment given for many years to a great many
hands at the harbour of Ardrossan,--of late years in the formation
of the railway,--the great increase of trade by an additional harbour
within a mile of Saltcoats,--the improved state of agriculture,--
many families from Ireland and the Highlands settling in the place,--
and a few unconnected with business, from partiality to the situa-
tion, either renting houses or building for themselves,--may be sup-
posed to account for the increase of the population.

	Character, &c. of the People.--In 1650, various cases of witch-
craft occurred in this parish, as appears from the records of the
Presbytery of Irvine. Among others, Margaret Couper and Ka-
tharine Montgomerie, both of Saltcoats, were apprehended on pre-
sumption of this crime, and on what was the chief evidence in such
matters, "common bruit." They confessed the usual charges of
renouncing their baptism, taking a new name from the devil, of
having familiar intercourse with him, and of "sundrie malefices,
and drawing on of others to the devil's service." So late as 1735,
a man and his wife in this parish were laid under sentence of lesser
excommunication, for consulting a fortune-teller at Paisley, to find
out the person who had stolen their money. These crimes and
customs have now disappeared. Would, we could add, that there
was an equal decrease of all other crimes. But though we have cer-
