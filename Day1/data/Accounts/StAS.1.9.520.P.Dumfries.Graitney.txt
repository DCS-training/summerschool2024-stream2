   Climate, Soil, etc.-The climate is temperate and the air
healthful.  No local distempers are prevalent.  There are
several instances indeed of rheumatic and nervous disorders,
particularly among the lowest class of the inhabitants, owing
to their living in cold and damp houses, to their enjoying
but a scanty share of the comforts of life, and in some cases
perhaps to the indiscreet use of tea and spiritous liquors.
There have been some instances of longevity.  It appears
from a grave-stone in the church-yard here, that of 2 bro-
thers, who died a century ago, the one was 111, and the
other 110.  In the year 1791, a woman died at the age of
103, but her name could not be found in the parish-record.
There is now living one woman upwards of an 100, two
between 90 and 100, and several persons between 80 and
90, which are striking proofs of the salubrity of this part of
the country.-The soil is various.  Except some tracts of
moss and boggy grounds, which are incapable of improve-
ment, it is in general dry and sandy, mixed with stones.  In
some parts, and particularly on the sea-side, it is a fine rich
loam; in others, of a wet and clayish nature.  In almost eve-
ry part, however, the soil is fertile, and, when properly cul-
tivated, yields abundant returns*.

   Population.-According to the returns made to Dr
Webster, the number of souls was then 1051.  It is be-
lieved that the population of this parish has been gradual-
ly increasing for many years.  There are now 1810 per-
sons, of whom are,
Under 10 years of age, 490 Between 10 and 20, 399
