which it appears, that, omitting fractions on the sums total
of every kind, the sowing of 1793 was, of rye, oats, and
barley, in cumulo, the oats at 5 firlots, 1511 bolls.

Produce.-Produce reckoned from 5502.0 to 6288 bolls.
Potatoes planted in 1793, 228 bolls, at 8 returns, 1824.
Lintfeed, 1893 Scots pints, sowed about 12 acres,

   Live Stock.-The live stock of all ages in 793 stood
thus:
Sheep, including lambs, and generally of small size,   1533
Black-cattle, including calves,                        1047
Horses of all kinds, including soals, few of the com-
mon sort reaching 13 hands,                             384
Swine omitted, but may be reckoned at,                   40
Of the value of live stock I am no competent judge.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The sowing of wheat, in 1793, was a mere trisle, because of low prices
and stock on hand, and because barley had been rising for several years.
Wheat is sown here according to the appearance of demand.  In the year
1795, every one sowed wheat largely.
