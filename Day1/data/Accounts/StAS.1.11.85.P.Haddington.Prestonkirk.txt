successively, until the whole crop is consumed.  This practice has
been found so profitable (particularly last year), as to clear at
the rate of 7 L. on the score of sheep.  The ground, thus ma-
naged, being clean, and in excellent condition, is very com-
monly sown with wheat in spring.  The general taste for agri-

and finding the experiment answer his expectation, he was led to extend it, the
year following, to upwards of 20 acres.  His neighbours, observing the success of
the practice, gradually followed him in it, until at length it became universally
