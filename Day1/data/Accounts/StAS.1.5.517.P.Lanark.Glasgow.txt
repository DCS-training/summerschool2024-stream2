volution.-In 1691 a fourth was added.-Glasgow, though 
originally only one parish, was afterwards, for the benefit of 
the poor, and ease of the ministers, divided into 7, and late-
ly into 8 parishes; which is the number of the churches, in 
which public worship is performed by ministers of the 
Presbyterian establishment.  The churches are, the Inner
High Church, the Outer High Church, the Tron Chruch,
the College Church, the Wynd Church, the North West
Church, St Andrew's Church, and St Enoch's Church.
The ministers are, in the same order,-Dr William Taylor,
Mr Robert Balfour, Dr John Maccaull, Dr John Gillies,
Dr William Porteous, Mr Alexander Rankin, Dr William
Lockhart, and Mr William Taylor.
   These ecclesiastical charges are all, except the Inner High
Church, under the patronage of the Town Council.  The
stipend of each of the ministers was at first L. 90, which
in 1723, was augmented to 2000 merks, in 1762 to 2500
merks, and 1788 to L. 165, without manse or glebe.
The Inner High Church is under the patronage of the
Crown, and its minister enjoys a glebe.
   Besides the above churches, there are also three chapels
of ease, under the inspection of the Presbytery of Glasgow.
The College Chapel, in which divine service is ordinarily
performed by preachers, or licentiates in divinity.  The
free Presbyterian meeting-house, formerly connected with
the Presbytery of Relief, but restored to the communion of
the Established Church in 1774.  This congregation is ve-
ry numerous, and divine service is at present performed in
it, by Meffrs John Macleod and Archibald Williamson, with
salaries, the former of L. 100, the latter of L. 70 Sterling.
There is also a Gaelic chapel, in which the service is per-
formed partly in Gaelic, partly in English, by Mr Angus
Mackintosh, with a stipend of L. 115 yearly.
