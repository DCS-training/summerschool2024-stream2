except 4, are possessed by two or more tenants, who, instead
of occupying each farm in common as formerly, are now be-
ginning not only to divide them from one another by march
dikes, but also to subdivide each farm, so that every tenant
may have hie own share marked out and inclosed.  This gives
them a true idea of property, promotes emulation, begets
spirit of improvement, and stimulates to industry and exertion.
Though averse to such a change at first, they now begin to
acknowledge the benefit of it; and the proprietor, who had
some trouble, before he could persuade them to adopt this
plan, has the satisfaction to find, that those who have tried it,
are sensible of its advantages, and mending in their circum-
stances.-Division of farms naturally leads to inclose them
and this, besides the advantage of securing property, occasions
a degree of shelter and warmth, much wanted in islands, where
generally the arable land lies along the shore, and is much

that trees will not grow, would it be an extravagant plan, to make one or more
small inclosures with a stone and lime wall, which might be rafted annually in
proportion to the growth of the trees, to the height, at last, of 20 or 30 feet?
Proprietors of such islands, who have handsome fortunes, and reside on their
own properties, might, it is presumed, lay out a little money yearly on such a
plan, without being considered in the I ght of projectors.  If "the growth of
"two blades of gears, where only one grew before, renders a man more
"useful to his country than the whole race of politicians put together,*"
how much greater service does he perform, who, by his attention and public
spirit, raises a few trees in those islands, where not one is now to be seen?
