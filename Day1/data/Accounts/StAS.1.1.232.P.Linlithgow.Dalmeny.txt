danger agriculture, and the population which depends on it.
We know the happy state of the greater part of England,
where rents are moderate, and the farmers are enjoying in
security, that plenty and comfort, which are the rewards of
their labours.  Agriculture may be affirmed to be (without
at all derogating from manufacturers and trade) one of the
most permanent pillars on which any nation can rest, and
they would highly deserve the name of patriots, who should
stretch sorth a generous hand to cherish husbandmen, pro-
mote improvements beneficial both to the landlord and to
the tenant, and ensure the most stable and virtuous income
which a people can possess.

   Depopulation and the cause of it.-From all accounts the pa-
rish was formerly much more populous than it is at present.
According to Dr Webster, the numbers 30 or 40 years ago,
were 1102; but as his survey appears in this parish, and per-
haps in most others, to have been confined to examinable per-
sons only, the whole number of souls was probably then
1300 or more.  In 1776, the number of souls was 1034
in the present year 1790, it is only 907.  The annual aver-
age of births for a century past, is 33 in the former half of
it from 1691 to 1740, it is 39; in the latter from 1741 to
1790, it is only 27.  And the decline (needless to be stated)
has been gradual; from 1771 to 1780 the number is 25;
from 1781 to 1790 it is 18.  The depopulation appears to
have been occasioned solely by one large district having been
turned from tillage into pasture.  This tract may consist per-
haps of  1500 acres, upon which formerly, it is said, were
15 or 16 farmers; at present, and for some time past, there
has not been one.  Probably the decrease of inhabitants in
several other parishes has been owing very much to a similar
cause.  The union of farms has often been stated as a cause
