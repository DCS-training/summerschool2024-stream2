   Mr Taylor, minister of Wamphray, was deposed soon after
the revolution.  Mr Gabriel Gullen succeeded him, and af-
terwards was translated to Drysdale.  Since his time, there
have been no less than seven ministers; viz.  Mr Irvine,
Messrs Barclay, senior, and junior, the latter of whom died
lately in the ministry of Haddington; Dr Barron, removed to
St Andrews; Dr Williamson, removed to Glasgow College;
and Mr Donaldson, who retired, and in 1794 was replaced
by the present incumbent.  A minister of Wamphray, of the
name of John Brown, who lived in 1659, has left some writ-
ings which are in high estimation here.
   The deposition of Mr Taylor was partly founded on a
charge of altering the marches of his glebe, and partly on
other grounds.  He was an enemy to the revolution and to
jurant ministers.  His temper, as to politics, seems to have
been the same with Archbishop Sancroft's; and it had the
same issue.  Mr Taylor joined the Cameronians, was muck
followed, and died rich.  He was connected with other sepa-
ratists from the church, M'Millan at Balmaghie, Hepburn at
Orr, and Gilchrist at Dunscore, who formed themselves into
a presbytery of Protester's, and drew down an Act and refer-
ence of the General Assembly against them in 1715.  So
strong was Mr Taylor's party, after his deposition, that it was
necessary for Mr Johnston, the steward-depute of Annandale,
to appear in arms at the church, and open a way to those
who preached by authority in his place.
   The glebe is not well ascertained; and there does not
seem to be any authentic document for defining it, except
the copy of a perambulation by the presbytery, sworn to by
four men, taken in the lifetime of the above Mr Taylor, and
