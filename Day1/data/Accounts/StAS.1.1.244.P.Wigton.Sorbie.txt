early; and the cattle, defended from the storm, seed at their
case.  The belts of planting, being carried along the ridges
of the hills, improve the appearance of the country, and give
warmth to all below them.

   The Earl has studied the nature of forest trees, and the
different ways of raising and treating them, with much atten-
tion.  Under his care trees grow on every exposure; and e-
very species of them thrive as well about Galloway House as
in my part of England.  The pine-after, or maritime pine,
is of so much use here, and indeed in such places as are
much exposed, as to deserve the greatest attention.  It is
hardy, and makes vigorous shoots, almost on the sea-beach;
and is an excellent defence for other trees.  The proper me-
thod of raising this most useful plant in the nursery insures
its success.  The seed ought to be sown on rich ground, in
the month of March.  Sixteen months afterwards, the plant
ought to be taken up in moist weather; its rap root shorten-
ed, and the young tree planted in a rich ground well pulve
rized.  It must be watered for ten or twelve days, till the
new roots begin to strike.  Thus transplanted, it must stand
for eighteen or twenty-four months, and then planted out
on any exposure.  Transplanting and cutting them, as
above described, make them put out many lateral roots,
which find food for the plant, and give it firmness in its
station.  Whereas, if it is permitted to remain two years in
the seed-bed, it puts down only one root, and is incapable of
resisting the storm.  Gentlemen, therefore, who plant near
the shore, ought to give the maritime pine as much soil as
possible, and raise a defence for it in its infant state.  Its
future service to them, and their posterity, will amply repay
their care and expence.
