lonies, at a convenient distance from the sea; but the original
inhabitants never allowed them to penetrate further.-There
are many monuments, of the remotest antiquity, which not
only prove the martial spirit of our ancestors, but also, that
they conducted operations with a method scarcely to be ex-
pected in these rude ages.  For a tract of 150 miles, watch
towers were erected in sight of each other.  If an enemy land-
ed, or if he was seen hovering in sight, in the course of two
hours, the whole country was alarmed; and the inhabitants
repaired to the shore, completely armed.  The signal was to
kindle a fire in each of these towers; and, as quick as lighten-
ing, all were illuminated, and all the country in motion.-
When any chief or hero distinguished himself in battle and fell,
a monument was erected to his memory.  This monument
consisted of a stone set up perpendicularly upon the spot
and the length of it determined the estimation in which the
hero was held by his countrymen.-The heroes, celebrated
by Ossian, were a militia established in Argyleshire, for the purpose
of defending the country upon any sudden emergency.  They
also were the dernier resort in battle, because they were the
best men that could be picked from the whole district.  Their
fame was so great, that the Irish were obliged to have recourse
frequently to their assistance, to defend them from the north-
ern nations.-When we behold such evident marks of ge-
nius among a rude people, we naturally regret that it is not
in our power to delineate the civil polity by which these times
were regulated.

   Progress of Civilization.-Philosophers, and men of specula-
tive genius, often amuse themselves with melancholy descrip-
tions of what they suppose must have happened in these bar-
barous ages, without the least allowance for the happiness and
independance which in some degree is peculiar to this state.
