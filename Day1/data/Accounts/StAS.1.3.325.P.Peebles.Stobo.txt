cows, whose butter, in respect of colour and richness, may be
distinguished from the milk of any other cows, which pasture
upon the higher grounds.  The greater part of the land is a light,
but fertile soil, lying upon a bed of gravel.  The soi, when
properly cultiavted, never fails, when the seasons is showry,
to produce excellent crops; but in a hot or dry year, it is
very much parched, and, of course, the labour of the most
skillful and industrious farmer is defeated.  It may be observ-
ed, that the land is in general stoney; and, what is remark-
able, in the hollows, where the stones most abpund, (in
such the bottom of them), there the heaviest part of the 
crop upon the field is produced.  It may be accounted for in
this way, that the stones, by sheltering or keeping warm any
small quantity of soil, which is amongst them, in the cold
seasons, and by protecting it from the scorching heat of the 
sun, in the hot seasons, always occasion a good crop.

   Ploughs, &c.-The Scrotch plough is chiefly used in the pa-
rish, as it is best adapted to the nature of the ground.  The
practice of ploughing eith oxen was for several years almost
totally given up, till of late, that some of the farmers have
begun to revive that antient practice.  In strong stoney land,
which is frequently to be met with in this parish, oxen
are preferably to horses.  The oxen move at a flow, but perse-
vering pace, and take the draught along with them; whereas
the metal of the horse is soon raised by resistance and
the whip; of course he becomes retrive and unmanagc-
able.  The oxen have also the advantage of the horse
in point of economy, being maintained at much less ex-
pence.  The chief objection against oxen ploughs is the 
flowsnss of their movement; but , when the superior execu-
tion of their work is considered,where the ground is crofs
