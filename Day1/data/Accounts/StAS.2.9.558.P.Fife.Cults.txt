			PARISH OF CULTS.

		PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR, SYNOD OF FIFE.

	    THE REV. THOMAS J. CRAWFORD, A. M. MINISTER.

	        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Situation, Boundaries, and Extent.-This parish is situated in
the heart of the county of Fife. In form, it is nearly oblong, and
in superficial extent about 3 1/2 square miles, being 2 1/4 miles long
from north to south, and 1 1/2 broad from east to west. It is bounded
on the west, by the parishes of Kettle and Collessie; on the north,
by Colessie, Monimail, and Cupar; on the east, by Ceres; and
on the south by Ceres and Kettle.
   Name.-The ancient name of this parish was Quilts or Quilques.
This word is alleged, in the former Statistical Account, to be of
Celtic origin, signifying a "nook" or "corner," and is suppos-
ed to be descriptive of the situation of the parish, which recedes
towards the south-east from the large strath or valley of the
Eden.
   Topographical Appearances.-There is nothing very remarkable
to be noted under this head. The surface is flat or slightly de-
clining towards the north, but hilly towards the south and east.
The eastern district is richly wooded,-the western somewhat bare
and uninteresting. Of the hills may be mentioned the Walton
hill, which rises at the south-east extremity of the parish,-and
the Pitlessie or Cults' lime hills, which adjoin it on the south.
On these, there are many points from which the fine scenery of
the neighbourhood, the beautiful valley of Stratheden, and "mine
own blue Lomonds," (as Sir D. Wilkie, in a letter to a former
clergymen of Cults, enthusiastically calls them,) may be seen to
the greatest advantage.
   Soil.-There is great variety in the quality of the soil. From
the northern boundary to the high road, the soil is a light brown-
ish sand, arid and unproductive, apt to be overrun, if left long
