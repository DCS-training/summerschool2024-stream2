can undergo great labour and fatigue, although they are not re-
markable for strength or size.  It is thought they have a more
florid complexion than those of the other Orkney islands,
by reason of their not having fire in such plenty, and that by
this they can be easily distinguished; so that the inhabitants
of the other Orkney islands have the same observation with
regard to them, as Tacitus makes respecting the northern
nations, "Sanguine pleno redundantur Septentrionales."  The
people, in so far as can be judged, are not remarkable for any
personal or mental qualifications, but are not deficient in na-
tural parts and sagacity.  There are some few that are indo-
lently inclined, and plead inability for hard labour; but the
generality of the people are industrious, or at least laborious,
as may be presumed from this circumstance, that there is no
place in the county where a greater quantity of grain is raised,
or kelp made, by an equal number of people.  There is no
manufacture carried on in these islands, unless kelp may be
reckoned one.  They manufacture linen and coarse cloths
for their own use only.

   Seasaring and Fishing.-From being accustomed to manage
boats, the people have acquired some knowledge of the sea;
and, if not fond of a seafaring life, at least have no aversion
to it.  Although the kelp and grain exported from these
islands might keep 2 or 3 small vessels in constant employ,
yet there is not one belonging to these islands.  There are
boats, from 5 to 10 tons burthen, for the purpose of carrying
peats from the isle of Eday, as also several smaller ones of a
ton burthens a little less or more.  These last serve for car-
rying peats, for fishing with, and for crossing the ferries oc-
casionally, and also for shipping the kelp.  The number of
boats are as follows:
