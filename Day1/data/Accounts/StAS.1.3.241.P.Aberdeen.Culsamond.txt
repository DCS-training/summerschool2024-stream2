coming from other places, and taking the waste farms.  The
present inhabitants are, males, 314; females, 304; in whole
618.  In Dr. Webster's report, the number is 810.  The an-
nual average of births, for six years, is 16; of deaths 8, and
of marriages 5.  Under 10 years of age, 116; between that
and 20 years, 84.  All the people attend the Established
Church, except 9 Seceders.

   Productions.-The productions of the parish are oats, bar-
ley, turnips, and a very few pease.  As the ground is fer-
tile, good crops are obtained.  The produce is more than
double of what is sufficient to maintain the inhabitants. The
number of horned cattle is 648; horses of the small kind
166; sheep, 850, and they annually rear up 140 calves.
It is not above 26 years since the planting of timber began;
now there are extensive plantations, all thriving well, con-
sisting of larix, spruce, oak, ash, elm, beech, birch, moun-
tain ash, and Scots sir.  Inclosing began at the same time,
and is found to be a very great improvement.

   Heritors, etc.-The parish is divided among four proprietors,
viz. Colonel M'Intosh of Newton, who is the only residing
heritor; Leith of Freefield; Gordon of Ardmeallie, and
the heirs of Innes of Breda.  The whole rent does not ex-
ceed 1150 l. stipend included, which one year with another,
may amount to 70 l. including the value of the glebe.

   Fuel.-The only fuel is peat and turs; of which there are
great abundance, except in one corner of the parish.
