     Statistical Account

   Woods.-There are some birch-trees thinly scattered
here and there by the coast of Slish-a-chi-lish, all along
from Unapool to Oldney, both places included.  There is
also of the same kind in many different thin plots, far
distant from one another, from Oldney to Inver-kirk-
ag; but this last mentioned tract lies at the distance of
at least two long miles from the coast.  From Poul-a-gar-
vir, on the south side of Inver river, thence along in an
east direction by Lower and Upper Tubegges winterings,
there are woods of the same kind.  In like manner, there
is from Little Assint, towards Tumore, the north side of
Loch Assint.  The whole woods, though of no great value,
are of considerable importance to the parish, as, in time of
great storms and falls of snow, every species of cattle re-
sort to them for shelter; nay, they browse on the copse;
however, there are in many places some slender trees,
which, if preserved, as now by the present factor, will cer-
tainly answer the end which the late good.  Earl had in
view; which was, that these woods should repair and build
the houses of all his Lordship's tenants, also the office-houses
of wadsetters and feuer, in the event they thought proper
to build here for themselves*.

   Gardens, etc.-There are small gardens, which afford
cabbages, etc. but there are no orchards.

   Kelp, etc.-There is no kelp made here.  The little
sea-ware that is, grows within the harbours formerly men-
tioned; all the remaining part of the coast is either bold or
shallow, consequently no sea-weed can grow there, though
occasionally some loose sea-weed may come in.
