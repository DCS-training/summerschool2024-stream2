of barony, weekly market, and yearly fair, together with the
Mill, Mill-lands, and Bourn of Aberluthnot, lying on the
banks of the North-Esk river.  Before the Reformation, and
in honour of the Virgin Mary, the parish obtained a change
of name, from Aberluthnot, to Mary-kirk, which it now
bears.  This is evident from the above-mentioned charter, in
which there is not the least mention of Mary-kirk.  It is
bounded on the south by the North-Esk river, which separates
it from the county of Angus, and parish of Loggie-Pert; on
the east and northeast, by St Cyrus, Garvock, and Laurence-
kirk; on the north and northwest, by Fordoun and Fetter-
cairn.  It is about 36° 45' north latitude, and 2° 10' west
longitude.  Agreeable to Mr Garden's map and measurement
of the county, anno 1774, the form of the parish is irregular.
It comprehends 8191 Scots acres*, and its length and breadth
are nearly equal.  It is at the distance of 4 Scots miles from
Montrose, and 6 from Brechin,-placed at the south extre-
mity of an extensive plain, generally known by the How, or
hollow lands, of the Mearns; and is so exceedingly flat and
level, that you seem, almost in every direction, gradually to
descend as you approach the river.  The only hills or eminen-
cies in this parish that seem greatly to variegate the scene are
Kirktown-hill and Balmaleedie, which run, the one behind
the other, in a northeast direction, about 2 miles.  Their
south extremities are at a little distance from the village of
Mary-kirk; and as the distance is increased, they advance by
a gradual elevation, until they terminate all at once by a sud-
den slope, in what is called the Wide Open.  This separates
them from the Garvock-hills, which extend several miles in
the same course, and are a boundary to the parish.

*Instead of 8191 Scots acres, Mr Garden should have made it 7591, hav-
ing measured 600 acres belonging to another parish.
