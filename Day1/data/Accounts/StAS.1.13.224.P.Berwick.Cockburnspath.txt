proved by the introduction, to a certain adequate degree,
of the Northumberland breed.  The full Northumberland
breed has been lately tried with great success by a pro-
prietor on some of the rich land of the parish.  The far-
mers of the lower division in general keep no stock, but
eat off their turnips with sheep and cattle bought in for the
purpose, and sold when fit for the butcher.  Sometimes the
turnips are eaten upon the spot by sheep, sometimes they
are led off to grass-fields for sheep and cattle; in the last
case the good farmer thinks it necessary to lay some ma-
nure upon the spot, which, even with this help, is found
rather to fall short of the land upon which the turnip has
been eaten as it grew: by this management the ground is
kept in such heart, that an excellent crop of turnips is some-
times raised after the oats, without dung being laid upon
that crop.  The upland farmers seldom feed for the butcher,
but give all their turnips to the keeping stock; they like-
wise frequently buy turnips from the lower farmers, and
bring down their stock to eat them.  In the lower division
of this parish the harvest is in general very favourable,
and the farmers show great activity on that occasion; so
that when a bad season does occur, they suffer less than in
many other places; they employ great numbers of High-
landers at that time, who come into the country for the
purpose, and no wages are spared when the season requires
a stress of hands.  In the upper division the harvest is often
late, and of course subjected to more severe weather.-No
limestone has been found in this parish; but lime is got
from the kills at Thornton-loch, at the distance of three or
four miles along the great post-road.  The lands of the
lower division of the parish are very much benefited by the
use of sea-ware as a manure.  It consists chiefly of the kind
known by the name of tangle (fucus palmatus), having a
very long stalk, and a broad spreading leaf; it seems to
