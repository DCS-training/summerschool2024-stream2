consequence of that monarch's putting in there, in his tour
through the Hebrides.  It is situated in the presbytery of
Sky, Synod of Glenelg, and County of Inverness.  Its
length from N. to S. is 9 computed miles, and its breadth
throughout 3, besides the islands of Raasay and Ronay, that
form a great part of it; the former of which, extending
all along the coast, is of the same length, and from 3 to 1 1/2
miles broad.  Ronay is about 4 miles long, and near 2
broad; and the whole parish may contain an area of 41,900
square acres.  It is bounded on the N. by Snizort; on the
E. by the channel or sound that divides Raasay and Ronay
from Applecross and Gairloch; on the S. by Strath; and
on the W. by an extensive moor that separates it from
Bracadale.

chan, or Kirktown, in the south end of Raasay, the pro-
prietor's seat.  On the W. Raasay rises with a seemingly
easy ascent, to a great height above the sea, and terminates
in a small, round, and green hill, flat at the top, and faced
with rock, called Dun-lan, from its similarity, perhaps, at a
distance, to these Danish forts, that go under the general
name of Dunes, so frequent in the Highlands and islands;
the meaning of the last part of the name is not certainly
known.  On the E. side of the island, the coast is very
high, steep, and nearly approaching to a perpendicular; as
is also the coast of Portree, on each side the mouth of the
harbour; but more especially on the N. where huge cliffs
