   1st. There are two schools in the parish.  The one is si-
tuated near the church, in the most populous part of the pa-
rish; and the other about four miles to the west of the
church, for the accommodation of the distant parts of the
parish.  Both the school-houses were built, and fitted up
with tables and seats, a few years ago, by the heritors; and
are still in a state of good repair.  The principal master
teaches in the school near the church, and has a free dwell-
ing-house adjoining to the school-house.  In this school are
taught the English, Latin, and Greek languages, writing, arith-
metic, book-keeping, and the principles of religion.  The ave-
rage number of scholars through the year is 50.  The salary is
L. 8: 16: 8 sterling; the school wages are moderate, and
amount to about L. 9:15 sterling per year; the school-
master is precentor and session-clerk, for which he receives
annually about L. 1:8:4: so that his whole emolument
is a free house, and about L. 20 sterling in money.-In the
second school are taught the English language, writing, arith-
metic, book-keeping, and the principles of religion.  The
salary appropriated to this school is L. 2:6:8 sterling per
year; the school wages amount to about L. 6:13:4: so that
the annual emolument of this schoolmaster is L 9.  For
