the fiars of the commissariot of Hamilton and Campsie, half a
chalder for communion elements, with a manse, and about 3 1/2
acres for a glebe, beside grass for a horse and 2 cows on the
common.-The manse was built in 1656, and enlarged and
slated in 1714, at the joint expence of the College of Glasgow,
and the former and then present minister.  It is now in a
ruinous condition.  The church was rebuilt in 1750, but not
finished compleatly till 1784, and is now in good condition.

   Poor.-The number on the poor's roll is about 15 annually;
mostly aged and infirm women, who have from 6 d. to 1 s.  Ster- 
ling weekly.  Oceasional assistance is given likewise to poor
families, of from 5 s. to 10 s. Sterling at a time.  No public
charity is given to any that go about begging, except now and

interest of about 300 L. Sterling, mortified to the kirk session.
These funds have continued, without much increase or dimi-

   Schools.-There are 4 public schools in this parish, 3 of

with 1 s. 8 d. for each marriage, and 9 d. for each baptism; be-

1744, Mr. Patrick Baird, merchant, left a memorial worthy
of record, bequeathing 325 L. Sterling for erecting a school at
Auchenloch, the place of his nativity.  He devoted 15 L. Ster-
ling of the interest to be paid annually to the schoolmaster;
and 1 L. 5 s. to a young man, for preaching a sermon at Auchen-
loch on Christmas (which was the donor's birth day), and to
buy books and buns (rolls) for the scholars.  To this dona-
