   In 1811, there were only four spinning-mills in Dundee driven
by steam-engines, making altogether about sixty-one horse-power;
converting into yarns about one and a-half tons of flax per day, or
468 tons annually, and producing about 224,640 spindles of yarn.
The whole capital then invested in machinery in Dundee did
not exceed L.22,000, and the whole flax imported into the whole
of Scotland was then about 7000 tons. At present (1832) there
are upwards of thirty flax spinning-mills in Dundee and the im-
mediate neighbourhood, driven by a steam power equal to 600
horses, consuming 15,600 tons of flax, and producing 7,488,000
spinles of yarn per annum, while the sum invested in machinery
has been estimated at L.240,000. In these mills about 3000
persons are daily employed. Of these there are under eighteen years
of age, 1073 individuals; under fourteen, 600 ; some under twelve
and even from six to seven years of age. The number of manufac-
turers is by last census, 363; and the number of families employed
in the different departments of the linen trade is 6828; to which
wages to the amount of L.156,000 a-year are understood to be paid.
More than one-half of those employed in the mills are boys and
girls from ten to eighteen years of age; the remainder are partly
men and partly women of all ages.
   The time of labour daily in the mills at present is twelve and a-
half hours, exclusive of the time allowed for meals; which is half
an hour for breakfast, and the same time for dinner. The work
commences at about half-past five o'clock in the morning, and
closes at seven in the evening.
   The following are the average wages at present paid at the
mills, and generally in the linen manufacture in Dundee, viz. to
flax-dressers from 10s. to 12s. weekly; girls and boys, 3s. to 6s. ;
women, 5s. to 8s.; weavers, 7s. to 10s.; mill-wrights, 14s. to
18S.
   These wages, though much lower than they once were, owing
to the altered state of the prices of goods, as well as of the
rate of wages in the country, yet, from the generally moderate rate
of provisions in Dundee, the economy and prudence used in the
families of the operatives, and their having regular employment,
are understood to afford to the persons engaged in the linen ma-
nufacture here, as many comforts as are enjoyed by any similar
description of persons in any other department of national indus-
try; and that, notwithstanding the extraordinary influx of the na-
