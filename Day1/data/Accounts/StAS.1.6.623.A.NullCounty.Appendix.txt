                Physical Phenomena.                     623

   Several months previous to this eruption, a heavy dark bluish
sulphurous fog had been observed to rest over the island
when not dissipated by the wind; this fog, at times, was
spread all over Europe. The year before this eruption, and a
few months before the earthquakes in Calabria, a contagious
disease called the Influenza spread through Europe.
   This volcanic eruption in Iceland is perhaps the most remar-
kable yet recorded in history. One stream of burning lava ex-
tended 40 miles in length, and 16 in breadth, and was in
some places between 4 and 500 feet deep *!
   Upon the 18th of August 1783 - A remarkable meteor or
ball of fire was seen to pass from north to south, about half
past eight in the evening. This meteor was seen all over Bri-
tain, and in many places upon the continent of Europe. This
phenomenon happened much about the time of the termina-
tion of the volcanic eruption in Iceland, and it is remarkable,
that this meteor was first seen to the north-west of the Shet-
land and Orkney islands, in the quarter of Iceland.
   Upon the 12th of September 1784 - A very extraordinary
phenomena was observed at Loch Tay. The air was perfect-
ly calm, not a breath of wind stirring. About nine o'clock in
the morning, the water at the east end of the loch ebbed about
300 feet, and left the channel dry. It gradually accumulated
and rolled on about 300 feet farther to the westward, when
it met a similar wave rolling in a contrary direction. When
these waves met, they rose to a perpendicular height of five
or six feet, producing a white foam upon the top. The wa-
ter then took a lateral direction southward, rushing to the
shore, and rising upon it four feet beyond the highest water
mark.
