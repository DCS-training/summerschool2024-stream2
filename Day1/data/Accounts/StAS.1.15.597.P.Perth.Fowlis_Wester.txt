bridge, which consists of a single arch 15 feet wide, and,
though on a level with the road, is 32 feet high above the
surface of the water, which there becomes 14 feet deep;
that is, while the river is in its ordinary state and not swel-
led by the rains.  While in this low state, also, the water at
the cascade is, by the projection of a rock in the middle of
the stream, divided into two parts, betwixt which it was u-
sual, some time ago, to hang a creel or basket, by means of
an iron chain, in such a manner as to catch multitudes of a
kind of white trout, as they were called, or young salmon
weighing about three pounds each.  The fishes attempted
to overleap the cascade, and hundreds that succeeded, have
by rods and nets been taken above it in a summer; but,
it is believed, the far greatest part, to the amount of some-
times 60 in a day, failing in the attempt, dropt into the bas-
ket for the benefit of the principal heritor.  This advantage,
however, has been entirely lost for ten years past by the
building of a mill-dam at Cromwell Park, in the parish of
Methven, since which, none of that species has been found
in this part of the river.  Excepting a few trees about some
farm houses, and a Scotch fir plantation of three acres, noth-
ing appears to have been planted on the North side of the
river; but the South bank on the estates of Abercarney and
Gorthie, was, at least 30 years ago, planted with stripes of
coppice wood, in which ash, and especially oak and birch
are prevalent.  These, with the additions more lately made,
may extend to 16 acres.  The largest plantations formed
within these 12 years, are on the heights of the ridge for-
merly described, where some hundred acres have been plan-
ted with Scotch fir, interspersed with some oak, birch and
larix.
   The hills or moors on both sides of the Almond contain
several tracts of black moss, which supply most of the peo-
