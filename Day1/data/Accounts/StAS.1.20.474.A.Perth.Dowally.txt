     CROPS AND CULTURE.

   Till within these few years, the state of agriculture in
this parish was extremely rude.  Four horses were often
seen working abreast in the same plough, and the driver in
front of them, walking backwards.  The plough was of a
clumsy construction, with unwieldy wooden mould-boards.
The farmer, whatever the state of the weather as, obsti-
nately adhered to the immemorial practice of beginning to
plough on Old Candlemas Day, and to sow on the 20th of
March.  Summer fallow, turnip crops, and sown grass, were
unknown; so were compost dunghills, and the purchasing of
lime.  Clumps of brushwood, and heaps of stones, every
where interrupted and deformed the fields.  The customary
rotation of their general crops was, 1.  Barley; 2.  Oats;
3.  Oats; 4.  Barley; and each year they had a part of the
farm employed in raising flax.  The operations respecting
these took place in the following succession.  They began
on the day already mentioned to rib the ground, on which
they intended to sow barley, that is, to draw a wide fur-
row, so as merely to make the land, as they termed it, red.
In that state this ground remained, till the fields assigned to
oats were ploughed and sown.  This was in general accom-
plished by the end of April.  The farmer next proceeded
to prepare for his flax crop, and to sow it, which occupied
him till the middle of May, when he began to harrow, and
dung, and sow, the ribbed barley land.  This last was some-
times not finished till the month of June.

   It was not difficult for an enlightened observer to trace
the causes which produced and had perpetuated this rude
state of agricultural practice.  Where there are burdensome
services to be performed by the tenant; where there is no
inclosing, and no winter heiding; where leaves are short,
and where the farm of one tenant consists of disconnected
