     Statistical Account

accounted for from the particular state of the parish.  The
great body of the inhabitants live in the town and villages.
Of these there are a number of small proprietors, and others
who farm from 1 to 2, 3 or 4 acres, for convenience, gene-
rally tradesmen, who depend upon their trade for the sub-
sistence of their families, and by consequence have neither
leisure nor skill to manage their little farms to the best ad-
vantage.  From this division of the land, about the town
and villages, into small portions, it lies uninclosed and na-
ked, and from the want of a more skilful ploughing and rota-
tion of crops, though well manured, it has neither that beau-
ty nor richness, to which its soil and situation are both na-
turally disposed.  There are a few farms of from 2 to 3 and
4 ploughs in the parish, of which that of Falkland Wood or
Park is the most extensive.  There are some inclosures,
and a taste for them is prevailing; but, in general, the land
is very naked.  Oats and barley are the prevailing crops.
Peas and turnip are raised in small proportions.  Artificial
grass, as clover and rye-grass, begins to be cultivated with
more attention.  Flax too is raised, and in some years in
considerable quantities.  The whole produce, however, is
not sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.  The
old valuation of the parish, as it stands in the cess-books, is
L. 5824.  The present bears a proportion to the increased 
value of land.  The farms, from the various quality of the
soil, are very differently rented; but, it is believed, in ge-
neral moderately, considering the late rise of rents.  That
of the land immediately about the town is from L. 2 to 
L. 2, 10 s. the acre.  The price of labour and servants
wages are, as in the country in general, high.  The day-
labourer has 10 d. in winter, and 1 s. or 1 s. 2 d. in sum-
mer.  Men servants have from L. 5 to L. 7, women from 
L. 2 to L. 3 wages.
