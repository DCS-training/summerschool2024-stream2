368           GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

beds of sand are so uniformly deposited in something like hori-
zontal strata as to shew distinctly that they must have been form-
ed in very still water.  The surface of the clay, on the other hand,
is generally covered with sand a few feet deep, and which con-
stitutes a moorish soil peculiar to the district.  But under that
sandy soil, when cleared away, the surface of the clay is seen
thickly indented with irregularly shaped holes of from one to three
feet deep, notwithstanding of its firm tenacious character, and
which shews in the clearest manner, that, before the moorish sand
was deposited, its surface had been washed and broken by water
far more violently agitated than what had happened during the
long period of the slow deposition of the argillaceous sediment,
and as the level character of the stratum of the clay, as marked by
the lamina of fine sand, shows that in all probability it, had been
deposited in very deep water, so its broken surface may be sup-
posed to have resulted from its being raised into, and washed by
comparatively shallow water, before being left entirely dry.  The
deposition of the seams of fire-clay in the sandstone strata may
apparently be referred to the formation of the earlier period of the
Carboniferous series, while the blue clay of the lower district would
appear to belong to a more recent period, although at the same
time anterior to the trap irruption.
   5th, Sandstone for building can be readily obtained, and some
of the trap quarries likewise produce excellent materials for the
same purpose, but nothing can excel the latter rock for road mak-
ing, and throughout a great portion of the county, it is easily ob-
tained in the utmost abundance.  In some situations, too, such as
at North Berwick-law, the trap, although not stratified, is of that
firm texture as to be cut into blocks, and used for gate posts, and
likewise heavy rollers suitable for the purposes of the agricultu-
rist.
   Such, in a brief sketch, are some of the leading facts in the geo-
logy of Haddingtonshire.  On a transient glance of the subject,
the mind is apt to perceive nothing but merely a succession of
tremendous convulsions of nature, which have been alike ruin-
ous as irresistible.  But a more deliberate consideration of all the
astonishing phenomena, connected with the deeply interesting
subject, that have followed each other during the lapse of an al-
most inconceivable number of ages, leads to the cheering convic-
tion, that design by a Supreme Ruler is most distinctly manifested
