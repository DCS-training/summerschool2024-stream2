gow there are two parishes whose ministers are elected by the
people. The parishioners of Rutherglen, with a model of patron-
age so liberal that 471 persons voted at the last election, have been
deprived of the ministration of a pastor for nearly eight years, while
those of Cadder, after long and painful litigation in the Supreme
Ecclesiastical and Civil courts, are again without a pastor.
	Manse.--The manse was rebuilt in 1781. It is commodious,
but ill situated, being nearly in the centre of the town.
	Glebe.--On 17th January 1667, the presbytery of Glasgow, con-
sidering that the glebe of Rutherglen contained only three acres,
added two additional acres of kirk land, lying on the west side of
Ruglen burn, and contiguous to the glebe.
	Churchyard.--The churchyard is elevated several feet above the
streets, by which it is bounded on the south and north, and is sur-
rounded by trees. In 1660, the magistrates and council ordered
the trees, then growing old, to be cut down and others planted in
their room. These having served their time were cut down in 1715.
The present trees occupy their place. It seems to have been an-
ciently a religious custom, probably coeval with the offering of sa-
crifices, to have trees surrounding burying-grounds.
	Schools.--The parochial schoolmaster is appointed by the town-
council. In 1685, his salary was L. 80 Scots, viz. L. 60 from the
burgh funds, and L. 20 from the landward heritors. In 1793, the
salary was L. 10 Sterling, paid from the burgh funds. Quarter
wage for reading English, 2s.; writing, arithmetic and Latin, 2s. 6d.
In 1836, the parochial schoolmaster has a free house and a salary
of L. 16, 13s. 4d., paid from the burgh funds. There are seven
other schools in the parish, the teachers of which have neither
dwelling-houses nor salaries. One of these schools is for Roman
Catholics, and another for girls, taught by a females. Fee per
quarter, English reading, 2s. 6d.; knitting and sewing, 2s. 6d.:
reading and writing, 3s.: writing and arithmetic, 3s. 6d.; Latin
and Greek, 5s.; book-keeping, 15s. In these schools there are
414 scholars, and in the Sabbath schools 383 scholars.
	Valued Rent of Rutherglen.--According to Ure, the valued rent
in 1793 was L. 21 00. Scots.* The real rent, at the average price
