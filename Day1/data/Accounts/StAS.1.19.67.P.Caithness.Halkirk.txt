of his farm and credit.  These will necessarily require the
whole of his industry and time, though none of them were
bestowed to serve the purposes of the landlord.  Here it
may be said, that these services are abundantly compen-
sated by the easy terms on which they hold their tacks.
This is mere delusion; for scarcely will any consideration
of this kind, were it true, compensate the neglect of their
own necessary affairs at home.  Besides, on the suppo-
sition that they have value in their tacks for these services,
yet, being always in pinching circumstances, it is with the
greatest reluctance they perform them.  Because they are
not animated with a present meal for their hungry paunch,
and with the prospect of payment at night to carry it home
to a craving family, they consider the whole as lost time
and labour; therefore they perform the service but very

work is if the night is come.  This being the case, what
they do is far short of the work of a day-labourer, who ex-

credit, of necessity oppress the suckeners.  The sucken-
ers complain to the laird, or his factor.  They get no
hearing or redress.  They return home, lamenting their
fate.  The millers redouble their oppression.  The sucken-
