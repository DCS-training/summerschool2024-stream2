ted for some years past.
   There are few or no farms in this parish, in which coals are
not to be found; but no coal-work is carried on in the parish.
The Earl of Hopetoun has lately opened a coal pit, about a

now the property of the family of Hopetoun; who have fre-

Within the bounds of this presbytery, containing 19 parishes,
there are 13 meeting houses belonging to the Seceders.  But
of late, they seem to have lost much of that zeal, by which
they were distinguished.-The principal cause of the de-
population in this, and in the neighbouring parishes, is the
