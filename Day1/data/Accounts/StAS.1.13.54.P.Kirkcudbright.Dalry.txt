but on the parts where either of the two former varieties
takes place, the crop without manure will be but of little
value.  It is much to be regretted, that when the holm of
Dalry was divided and let to the feuars, the divisions had
not been made with a little more attention to please the
eye of the spectator, as well as to promote the convenience
of the possessor.  Had the different enclosures been laid out
as much as was possible in rectangular figures, and fenced
with thorn-hedges, instead of stone and turf fences, they
would have been both more beautiful and advantageous.
For though at the upper end of this holm an embank-
ment was erected above ten years ago, which prevents the
Ken from overflowing a considerable part of the holm next
to the high lands, as it formerly did, yet there is still a
considerable part of it, which is often overflowed, and then
the crop is in the utmost danger of being swept away by
the deluge.  Thorn hedges would have prevented the crop
from being carried away by a flood, and would have been
sufficient fences to the different enclosures; so that if any
one of the possessors had been at more pains than the rest,
to enrich and prepare a field for sown grass, he might have
reaped the produce himself, without being exposed to the
encroachments of his neighbours; whereas the stone and
turf fences are insufficient to secure this advantage; for be-
sides being too weak and low to stop every kind of cattle,
they are liable to be dashed down and swept away by the
floods; and thus are rather hurtful than beneficial to the
possessor, though he pays for them a high rate of interest,
and is bound to keep them up, or at least to leave them so
at the end of his lease.  Hence it is evident, that if the
different enclosures were sufficiently fenced with thorn-
hedges, they would be far more valuable to the possessors,
by saving them the expense of herdmen, preserving their
pasture from their neighbours cattle, and affording them an
