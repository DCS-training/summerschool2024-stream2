     Statistical Account

of land belonging to this parish, about 7 measured miles to
the W. of the church, on the N side of the river Beau-
ly, called the Davoch of Erchless, where the chief of the
Chisholms has his seat.  This Davoch almost intersects the
neighbouring parish of Kilmorack.  The farm round the
Chisholm's seat lies well, and is supposed to be one of the
most fertile spots in the parish.  Erchless, in Gaelic Eaar-
ghlais, the name of the Chisholm's seat, signifies a piece of
ground, forming the segment of a circle, situated by the
river Glass.  Above the place of Erchless, the river Farrar,
coming from the N. W. falls into the river Glass, which
runs from the S. W.  The land lying on both sides of the ri-
ver Glass forms Strath-glass, or the Chisholm's lands.  The
south side of said river only belongs to this parish.  In this 
Strath there is not much corn raised; but there is a great
deal of good pasture for black cattle, sheep, and goats.
What lies of the parish to the south of Strath-glass, is very
high ground, all covered with heath, and only fit for pastu-
ring sheep and goats.

   Climate.-The climate is reckoned very salubrious.
There is much less rain in the lower end of this parish than
in Strath-glass:  For on the east end of the parish the Strath
on both sides of the Beauly is about 3 or 4 miles broad; so
that this part of the country lies at some distance from the
neighbouring high mountains.  Thus the clouds that break on
the Strath-glass mountains, and fall down in heavy showers
in this narrow valley, are often spent before they come to
the lower end of the parish.  But the inhabitants of Strath-
glass seem to be fully as healthy as any people in the pa-
rish*.
