     Statistical Account

ple by men of skill and influence, many parts of Lochbroom
could be made a good corn country.

   Harbours, Shipping, etc.-Besides the harbour at the vil-
lage, already mentioned, there are so many other harbours
in Lochbroom, that it would be tedious to enumerate them.
These are chiefly to be found on both sides of the Meikle and
Little Lochs, and along the coast of Coigach, There are 6
vessels belonging to Ullapool; which, together with 4 or 5
more belonging to the fishing stations at Tanera and Isle
Martin, employ about 40 seamen.  There are no fixed fer-
ries here, but one is much needed betwixt Ullapool and the
opposite side of the lake.

   Mineral Springs -There is a mineral spring at Leckmelm,
about 2 miles east of Ullapool, which is thought to be of a
very salubrious quality.  Perhaps it may hereafter be found
to contain powerful virtues, though no pains have as yet been
taken to ascertain then.  Some medical gentlemen, who
happened to pass that way, were of opinion that it would be
serviceable in consumptive cases.  There is another mineral
spring upon the glebe, but little or no notice has been ta-
ken of it.

   Church, etc.-There is a pretty good church here, which
was built several years ago.  It was lately repaired and ele-
gantly seated at the expence of the heritors.  The money
stipend is 91 L. Sterling, and the glebe is worth about 30 l.
a year.  There is besides a large track of ground mortified
for the benefit of the church, worth 20 L. a year.  So that
this living in all is worth 141 L. Sterling a year.  The pre-
sent incumbent is Mr. Alexander Stronach.  Mr Mackenzie
of Cromarty is patron.  There are no funds for the poor,
