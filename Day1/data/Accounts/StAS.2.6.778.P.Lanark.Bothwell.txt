                           II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   In the reign of Alexander II., the barony of Bothwell was held
by Walter Olifard, the justiciary of Lothian, who died in 1242.
In the troublous times which followed the death of Alexander III.
it was in the posession of a family of the name of Moray.  It then
consisted, as appears from early writs, of " a tower and fortalice
and their pertinents," and of lands in various districts, constituting
a lordship.  It is not, however, till the reign of Edward I. of
England, that the castle and barony of Bothwell are brought pro-
minently into notice.  From an article in the Rotuli Scotiae, already
mentioned, entitled " Progressus et Mansiones Edwardi Primi re-
gis Angliae dum bellum in Scotia gerebat," it appears that Edward
resided in the Castle of Bothwell from the 17th to the 20th Sep-
tember 1301.  In 1307, Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke,
fled from Loudon bill, where be had been defeated by Wallace, to
Bothwell Castle, and in 1309 be was appointed governor of the
castles of Selkirk and Bothwell.  According to Barbour, Sir Wal-
ter Fitzgilbert, ancestor of the family of Hamilton, was governor of
Bothwell at the time of the battle of Bannockburn, as appears
from the following lines:

                   The Earl of Herford fra the Mell‚
                   Departed with a great menay,
                   And straucht to Bothwell took the vae
                   That in the Inglis mennys fay,
                   Was halden as a Olace of wer.
                   Schyr Walter Gilbertson was ther,
                   Capitaine, &c. &c.

   On the death of Robert Bruce, Edward III. again invaded
