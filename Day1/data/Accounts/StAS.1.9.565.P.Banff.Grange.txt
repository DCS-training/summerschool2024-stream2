frost came upon them before they were properly filled.
The tenants in this parish were in general at that period
in very good circumtances, the greater part of them ha-
ving from L. 50 to L. 150 or upwards out at interest, be-
sides the stocking of their farms; but the whole rent of the
parish was more than doubled a few years before; and in
1783, not only between L. 3000 and L. 4000 Sterling, sup-

farthest, without any encouragement to inclose, or build
good houses; and no respects is paid to the best cultivator,
nor even to the tenants in best circumstances; he that
will promise most rent is always preferred.  Considering
these circumstances, and the heavy oppressive maltures and
mill-services to which they are subjected, amounting to
