   In the above-mentioned charter of 1592, the King, in or-
der to preserve the government of the town pure from any
mixture of aristocracy, gives power to the council to dif-
pose of their property to residing burgesses and their heirs-

whole, and the Earl of Findlater and Lord Banff a consider-
able part of the remainder.  It was the remark of Dean

confirms, that "great changes and alienations of property
" have created new and great dependencies."

   Duff House and Park.-Duff House, the principal seat of
the Earl of Fife, and the beautiful scenery of this Lordship's
park, are well known to the tourist, and described in the
journals of several celebrated travellers.
   The house is a large quandrangular building, planned and

completed.  The original plan, which is truly magnificent,
may be seen in Wolf's Vitruvius.
   Duff House contains several very elegant apartments, in
which is a great profusion of paintings, chiefly portraits.
Those particularly noticed by Mr Pennant, are, Frances
