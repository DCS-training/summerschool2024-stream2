   Ecclesiastical State and School-Colonel Hay of Rannes is pa-
tron.  The value of the living, exclusive of the manse, and a glebe
of 5 acres, is 104 bolls meal, 2 1/2 bolls bear, and 5 L. 1s. 2 8/12 d.
besides the vicarage tithes of a part of the parish, which will
amount to about 4 L. per annum.  The manse was built in 1732,
and is now rainous; but the heritors have agreed to build a
commodious new one in 1793.  The church is old, but in
very good repair.-The encouragement for a schoolmaster
here is very poor.  The salary is only 4 1/2 bolls of meal, and
1 L. 13 s. 4d. being the interest of a half years vacant stipend
bequeathed by the family of Leithhall.  Notwithstanding which,
the present schoolmaster has remained in this office since the
year 1745, and is perfectly satisfied and contented with
his lot.

   Poor.-Besides the poor upon the roll, who receive public
charity, a few others get occasional supplies.  None belong-
ing to the parish are permitted to beg.  This however does
not prevent a number of vagrants, from other places, stroll-
ing about and extorting alms from the inhabitants, and often
pilfering what they can lay their hands upon.  The funds be.
longing to the poor, above stated, are lent out at interest.  The
greatest part of it was mortified by Mr. William Watson, and
Mr. William Forbes, both ministers of Lesly.  In the year
1782, very little encroachment was made upon the capital
belonging to the poor, for though they were pretty humor.
ous, and provisions very dear, yet they were liberally sup-
plied; the Rev. Mr. Stewart having generously lent money to
the kirk-session, without interest, for purchasing meal to the
poor sort of inhabitants, which was sold out at a reduced
price; and to those who could not afford to purchase, it was
given gratis.
