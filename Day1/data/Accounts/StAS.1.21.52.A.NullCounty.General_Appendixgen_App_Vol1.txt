licence, and the expence of travelling to the office to account
to the collector once or twice a year, would only be 1 s. yearly.
   The poor schoolmasters are meantime perpetually harrass-
ed with letters from the stamp-collectors threatening them
with prosecutions; if they omit keeping all registers, they
have allowance from the act to do so; but as they have all
a fee of 8 d. or 1 s. for every birth and baptism, which is a
considerable addition to their small income, for fear of losing
that, they in general subject themselves to the inconvenien-
ces before specified, and keep a register of births and bap-
tisms, and no other.-This is a grievance which certainly re-
quires parliamentary redress.
   Noblehouse is the only inn in the parish; there are besides
two alehouses, and two grocery shops, which sell drams.
   There is a quarry of white freestone in Lamancha grounds.
Excepting in the contiguous parishes of Linton and Newlands,
there is no freestone in the county of Tweeddale, the stone
being all mostly whin or slate.
   In the lands of Lamancha there is an endless variety of
clays; there is in particular a very thick bed of fire clay like
the Stourbridge clay; also various beds of marle; there is
likewise great abundance of alum slate.
   In these lands there is also a vein of stone in a hill, sup-
posed to be a native loadstone.
   In these lands of Lamancha there are also in the hills nine
different veins of iron ore, of considerable thickness, the
same as the Lancashire ores; one of these veins is entirely
grain ore; the rest are mixed with grain ore.  Manganese is
also found by itself and mixed with the iron ores.  These
ores are of easy access; the entry from the side of the hill;
plenty of level, and no need of pits.  These veins of ore ex-
tend through the hills belonging to the lands of Magbiehill.
