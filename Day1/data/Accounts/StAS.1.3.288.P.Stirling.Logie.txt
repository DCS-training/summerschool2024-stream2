and goates: these two soils are nearly equally divided by a
high-road, at the foot of the Ochil hills, running from Alva

     Poor.-Poor rates are adopted in this parish, one
half of which is paid by the heritors, and the other by the
tenants.  In the year 1774, the number of the poor was
33, for whom were contributed L. 40 Sterling.  L  28 was
paid by the heritors and tenants, and L. 12 out of the poor's
funds; but in 1775, L. 38 was distributed, and for some years

but without effect.  There is a high conical hill in this parish,
called Dunmyatt, from the top of which, is to be seen part
of 12 counties.  About half a mile from the foot of this hill
to the north, is a very fine well, which issues from more
than 60 springs, that rise through the sand and channel.  It
is called the Holy Well, and is said to have formerly been
much resorted to by the Roman Catholics.  There are ap-
pearances of silver and copper mines in this parish.  Some
of them have been wrough, but with little profit to the ad-
ventures.  The only one that seemed to prove advanta-
