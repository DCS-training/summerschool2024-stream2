   The population, in 1755, was 1000 souls.
   What accounts for this increase of 71 is, the settlement of
a colony of Highlanders, who had been forced to emigrate
from Strathnaven, where their farms were converted into
sheep pasture.
   These people, it would appear, had been comfortably si-
tuated in their former residence, as they all brought with
them, to this place, a very considerable stock in horses, cows,
sheep, and goats, and also in grain.  As to all other proper-
ty, every man of them might truly say, Omnia mea mecum
porto.  Their household furniture must therefore be describ-
ed negatively.  No bed, no table, no chair.  These the
Highlander does not reckon among the necessaries of life, as
he can make the earth serve him for all the three.
   In his shealing, composed of earth and a few sticks, you
find no other furniture than a few dishes for his milk, and a
barrel for his meal: So true in fact as well as philosophy, is
the maxim, Natura contenta est paucis.
