   The medical officers of the Infirmary are 5 in number, viz. 2
physicians, 2 surgeons, and a house-surgeon, who is resident.
There is also an apothecary employed to compound the medicines
prescribed, and, since the removal of the establishment into the
new house, two wards have been appropriated to the reception of
ophthalmic cases, and placed under the charge of the surgeon at-
tached to an eye institution in town.
   By a recent resolution of the managers, one of the physicians
and one of the surgeons are appointed to deliver courses of lec-

institution, it has become of much importance, as an auxiliary, to
the school of medicine lately established here by the authority of
the Universities, and by the exertions of several private indivi-
duals. The number of students frequenting the wards of the
Aberdeen Infirmary has for many years been considerable, and as
a certificate of attendance on its practice is received by the various
public boards connected with the service of the country, there is
every probability, that, while the opportunities and advantages pre-
sented to students by Aberdeen remain undiminished, there will
be no material or permanent diminution in the number of students.
During the last two years a considerable falling off has been expe-
rienced, but neither is Aberdeen the only medical school where
this has taken place, nor is the medical profession the only one in
which the number of entrants has been of late considerably di-
minished.
   It is shown by the table, that, during the last year, the number
of out-patients has been considerably diminished; and there is a
probibility that, in future years, it will be still less.-an arrange-
ment having been, in the course of the last year, entered into by
the managers of the Infirmary, who had become possessed, as
trustees, of a fund left by the late Mr Burnett of Dens, for " the
