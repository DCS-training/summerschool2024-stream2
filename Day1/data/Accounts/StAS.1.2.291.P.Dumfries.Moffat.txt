the lowlands, and plovers in the muirs.  Birds from the sea-
shore come in the season to hatch.-The common migratory
birds, are the cuckow, the swallow, and the woodcock.  The
bulsinch has appeared within the last 7 years, and seems to
multiply fast.

   Cattel.-Black cattle are few in proportion to the extent of
land in the parish; chiefly milch cows, kept by the farmers,
and the people in the village if Moffat.  They are generally
above the middle size; many of them excellent milkers.  The
number in the whole district is about 200.  Hardly any bul-
locks, or heifers are fattened in the parish; and only a few
cows, not exceeding 30.
   In the neighbourhood of the village of Moffat, a cow is
grassed at L. 1: 10 sterling.  New milk is sold for 1 d. the
Scots pint; skimmed milk for 1/2.  Butter for 9 d. per pound;
ewe-milk cheese for 6 s. the stone; both heavy weight.

   Sheep.-The sheep farmers, or store-masters, are not
much disposed to publish or make known the amount of their
respective flocks; but it is supposed, that there are, in all, from
18,000 to 20,000 sheep.-The prices of sheep stocks, of late
years, have been, for aged sheep, from L. 12 to L. 14 per score;
for young sheep, from L. 8 to L. 9; for lambs, from L. 3: 15,
to L. 6.

   Wool.-Besides the wool consumed in the parish, about
200 packs are annually exported.  It has gone mostly to Eng-
land, for these three years past.  Prices have been from 6 s. to
6 s 3 d. per stone.  Within the last 7 years, wool was sold un-
der 4 s. per stone; some under 3 s.  Within these few years,
there has been a considerable rise of the value both of sheep
and wool.
