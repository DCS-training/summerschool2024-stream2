general, of good quality.  The greatest part, even of the
higher grounds, is of a hard gravelly, or rocky bottom.  In
the highest and western part of the parish, there is a consider-
able proportion of wet and boggy land.  From land, which
has a southern exposure, has been drained, or is naturally
dry, crops have been raised as early, and as good, as from
lands many miles lower down the country.  The peculiar
fitness of the soil, for the pasturage of sheep, is evinced by,
their reputation in the country for foundness, for carcase, and
for wool.

   Climate and Diseases, etc.-The situation of the parish,
nearly centrical between the E. and W. seas, sufficiently in-
dicates the nature of the climate*-Though this parish ap-
pears level, when viewed from heights, greatly inferior to the
Ettrick hills on the N., and those of Liddisdale on the S;
yet it is so high, as always to intercept some portion of the
moisture of those heavy clouds, which are so often seen attract-
ed to either or to both of these quarters.  The autumnal rains
are particularly violent, and sometimes of long duration.  In
the months of November and December, they are accom-
panied with such boisterous winds, that only a few houses
can perfectly exclude the waters of the western tempest.  There
are instances of houses, built with lime, and judged sufficient,
through which these rains force their way every winter.  The
noxious effects of a damp atmosphere were formerly prevent-
ed by the copious use of spirits, and now by better houses
and clothing; but flannel is little, if ever, used by the labour-
ing people, among whom rheumatism is a general complaint,
