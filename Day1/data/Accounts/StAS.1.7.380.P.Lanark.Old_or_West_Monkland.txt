to Airdrie.  This road passes near the church, and traverses
the parish 7 miles.  By an act of Parliament just obtained, it
is to be extended to Edinburgh by Bathgate; and, when ex-

   Age, Diseases, etc.-Though there is no instance of re-
markable longevity, it may be concluded, that the situation
is healthy, since there are alive several persons above 90, and
many above 80.  Prejudices against inoculation, though not
entirely eradicated, are gradually wearing out.  Local dis-
eases are unknown.  Fevers and consumptions are most fre-
quent.  The former prevail after harvest, if the weather has
been hot.  Two families who reside at Lochend, (betwixt
two large lochs), are regularly attacked with this disease at a
certain time, when it does not visit any of the neighbours.
This must be owing to the exhalations from the water, which
stagnates and grows putrid.  Several young women of this
parish have fallen into consumptions by fitting too long on
the damp ground at tent preachings.

   Alehouses.-There are no less than 30 inns or public-houses
in the parish.  There, it must be confessed, are attended with
the most pernicious effects to the health and morals of the
people.  It is no uncommon thing for a labouring man to
spend all his wages in there houses, and suffer his unhappy
wife and children to continue in want and wretchedness.
Government could not adopt a wiser measure than to raise.
the price of licenses.  If a reformation of manners is not
happily effected, what must be the consequence of such ex-
ecrable practices, it is not difficult to say.  There is a certain
gradation in the political, as well as in the human body.
