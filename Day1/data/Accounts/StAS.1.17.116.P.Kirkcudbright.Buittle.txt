the greater part of Buittle is excellent, being mostly what is
called the Sheep's fescue grass.  Exclusive of other good pro-
perties, it may be adverted to, that this plant defies extirpa-
tion by either bad farming or bad stocking: For often when
land is so much plowed that it will bear no more corn, and
even the roots of the larger grasses are destroyed, we see the
field covered with the fescue in a very short time.  Again, by
overstocking a pasture, the seed stalks of most grasses are
eaten up, and the very roots preyed upon.  But the prodi-
gious crop of small feeds, light and easily transferred by the
winds, afforded by the fescue, hinders its destruction in the
former fense; and the smallness of its fibrous roots in the
latter.

   Plants, Etc.-The natural productions of Buittle differ
little from those of the lower parts of Galloway in general,
and which, in all probability, will be particularly mentioned
in the account of every parish belonging to that district.
The plants and flowers in Buittle are no ways remarkable.
Even by gentlemen in affluent circumstances, that cultivation
of the earth, which produces an immediate return, and con
nects with general utility, is preferred to attempts of unprofit-
able curiosity, as to rearing exotic plants, or even those of
this climate that are of a precarious growth.  This parish,
indeed, abounds so much with excellent natural shelter, that
it is believed few plants or trees would fail here, that succeed
well in any other part of Scotland, if not of Britain.  With
great safety one might take any bet, that, communibus diebus,

ing connected with this fact, is true, we may place it among the
few benefits that superstition has conferred on mankind.
