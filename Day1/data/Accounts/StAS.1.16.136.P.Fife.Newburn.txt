cords which we have of these monks mention Hungus the
first King of the Picts, as their Great Benefactor; and St

Brude, the last King of the Picts, made a donation to them
of the isle of Lochleven; Kirkness was given to them by

of an old edifice near the western wall of his garden, and
in the very place where, according to the best accounts,
the church of the Culdees stood.  Some say, this was the
first Christian church in Scotland; and, indeed, the name
of Balchristie, as above explained, and the high probability
of the Culdees landing first on the adjacent inviting shore,
give considerable countenance to the tradition.

ruins; but a new mansion-house, as is believed, will soon
add to the beauty of these rural wilds.  He latebr‘ dulces
