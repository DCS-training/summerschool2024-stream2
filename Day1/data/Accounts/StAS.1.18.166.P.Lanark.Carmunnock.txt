null; since which period, the stone, though said to be of an
excellent quality, has been neglected.
   There are also extensive quarries of excellent free stone,
some of a soft, and others of a very firm texture.  What is
remarkable, in the whole estate of Cathkin, which is nearly
1/3 of the parish, there is no free-stone to be found, but all
below the surface is solid whin of the most durable kind, ex-
cept one or two inconsiderable quarries of rotten rock, useful
only on the highways.  In this district there are also massy
pillars of the stone called basaltes; a description of which has
more than once been given to the public.

   Water, etc.-In every part of the parish, and particularly
in the higher grounds, there are many springs of the most
excellent water, those especially which issue from the crevices
of the solid rock.  The quality of the water is so good, that
several gentlemen from the university and neighbourhood of
Glasgow, well known for their respectability, and high at-
tainment in the different departments of science, were at the
pains to make an accurate survey of all the different springs,
to try whether a quantity sufficient for the supply of the city
of Glasgow could be procured.  It was however found, upon
actually survey, that if all the springs upon the brow of the
hill were collected, with the view to be introduced into the
city, they could only afford 70 Scots pints in the minute,
which was 2/3 less than the quantity required.

   Meneral Spring, Rivers, Roads.-There is also a mineral
spring, said to be of considerable virtue in the cure of various
diseases, which many people in the neighbourhood used for-
merly to attend:  But for many years, the spring has been
deserted, sea bathing quarters being at present the more
fashionable resort.
