sedentary life subjects them to nervous complaints, which a
more active life would prevent.

   Rent.-As there is more firing in this parish than in the
adjoining ones, a great part of the land is divided into small
crofts, for which more rent is paid in proportion than for the
large farms; and the crofters subsist mostly by day-labour.
There are 16 heritors in the parish, 4 of whom reside in it.
The 6 principal heritors have from 500 l. to near 700 l. Scots
of valued rent each.  The valued rent is 4469 l. 13 s. 4 d.
Scots.  The real rent is greatly increased since the sale of the
York-Building Company's estate; notwithstanding which,
the tenants are much more thriving, as they do not depend
upon precarious tenures.

   Church and School.-The stipend amounts to 72 l. Sterling,
32 bolls of meal, and 15 bolls of bear, with a glebe of about
7 acres.  The salary of the schoolmaster, including his office
of session-clerk, is about 9 l. Sterling; and he may draw in
whole, including perquisites, about 16 l. per annum; a small
allowance for so useful a member of society.

   Population.-In 1755, the numbers were rated at 1471.
In 1791, they amounted to no more than 1318, being 586
males, and 732 females; of which number, 512 are under
20, 324 between 20 and 40, 270 between 40 and 60, 180
between 60 and 80, and 32 above 80 years of age.  There
are of married people, widows, and widowers, 337; and
these have had, in all, 1189 children, of whom 556 are sons,
and 633 daughters.  In order to make a more complete
comparison of the present and past population, there is sub-
joined from the session-book a note of the number of bap-
