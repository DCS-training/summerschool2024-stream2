wrong to pass over in silence, that piece of ground at the
meeting of the Black and White Esks, which was remark-
able in former times for an annual fair that had been held
there time out of mind, but which is now entirely laid aside.
At that fair, it was the custom for the unmarried persons of
both sexes to choose a companion, according to their liking,
with whom they were to live till that time next year.  This
was called hand-fasting, or hand in fist.  If they were pleased
with each other at that time, then they continued together for
life; if not, they separated, and were free to make another
choice as at the first.  The fruit of their connexion (if there
were any) was always attached to the disaffected person.  In
later times, when this part of the country belonged to the
Abbacy of Melrose, a priest, to whom they gave the name
of Book i' bosom (either because he carried in his bosom a
bible, or perhaps, a register of the marriages), came from
time to time to confirm the marriages. This place is only a
small distance from the Roman encampment of Castle-o'er.
May not the fair have been first instituted when the Romans
resided there?  and may not the "hand-fasting" have taken its
rise from their manner of celebrating marriage, ex usu, by
which, if a woman, with the consent of her parents or guar-
dians, lived with a man for a year, without being absent for
3 nights, she became his wife?  Perhaps, when christianity
was introduced, this form of marriage may have been looked
upon as imperfect, without confirmation by a priest, and,
therefore, one may have been sent from time to time for this
purpose.

   Improvements.-The principal improvement for such a soil
as this, is draining, which has been attended to of late, and
with good success. There is, however, an inconvenience accom-
panying this kind of improvement, which, if not attended to,
