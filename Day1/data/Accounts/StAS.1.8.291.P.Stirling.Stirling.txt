labour is less, because it is so unproductive.  Manufacturers
should consider themselves as obliged to increase the price of
female labour.
   But perhaps the chief cause of the numerous poor in Stir-
ling is the castle.  This may seem a paradox, but it is easy
to be explained.  The sole use of this fortness, at present, is to
be an asylum to invalids.  About 100 of these are generally
stationed in it.  These men, who probably enlisted at first,
from dislike to labour and regularity, do not find, in the army,
much opportunity of becoming attached either to industry or
sobriety.  Having generally contracted habits of thoughtles-
ness and dissipation, they retire into the castle, very little qua-
lified to enjoy the advantages of that situation.  Secured in
6 d. a-day, or looking forward to the Chelsea pension, the low
women in Stirling aspire at a connexion with them, and think,
that when they are wives of castle soldiers, they shall never
want.  When these invalids and pensioned soldiers are sober
and industrious, they are very able, with their pay, to pro-
vide a decent support for their families; but few of them are
of this character.  Being generally ignorant, vicious and de-
bauched, they get wives like themselves, or make them so.
All their income is usually spent with the day.  They never
get their houses furnished.  They live amidst meanness and
rags.  Their minds are debafed.  Their children are trained
up under the very worst example.  The fathers soon die,
worn out with intemperance.  They leave their families beg-
gared, unprincipled and debauched.  These families are the
nurseries of beggars.  Nearly one half of the paupers in Stir-
ling spring from there nurseries.
   Where there is so much poverty, there will of course be
much baseness and degeneracy of mind.  True religion only
can tame the heart, and sweeten the manners of the poor.  On
them, however, this is generally found to have little influence.
