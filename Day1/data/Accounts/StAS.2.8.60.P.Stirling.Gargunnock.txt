and the views from the rising grounds were varied, extensive,
lively, and interesting. It is the opinion of some gentlemen, that
the internal communication of the parish would be much improv-
ed, were a new line of road made from Fintry, through the east
end of Balfron parish, and by the foot of the Lennox hills, above
Boquhan and Leckie, till it passes between the village and the
church, and joins the new line of the Dumbarton road, near the
new bridge which has been erected over the Forth. Others are of
the opinion, that the new road from Fintry, instead of coming
above Leckie, and post the east end of the village, should come
down betwixt Boquban and Leckie to the Dumbarton road. Were
this line of new road to be made through the dryfield part of this
parish to Fintry, it would be the nearest road from Dunblane and
that neighbourhood, to the city of Glasgow.
