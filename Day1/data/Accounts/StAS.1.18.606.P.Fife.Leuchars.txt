in and about Leuchars, and members from the neighbouring
parishes are admitted.  The laws of the society are pious,
benevolent, and well meant.  Every member on his admis-
sion pays 2 s 6 d ster. and 8 d quarterly, or 2 s 6 d annually.
The intention of the fund is to relieve the members when

coal is at a great distance, and from the throng in the summer
season, the fetching one cart containing 5 load, costs 5 s 2 d 1/2,
and is the work of a long day for one man and 2 horses.
The proprietors of coal, are threatening to raise the price.

within there 20 years, affected with St Vitus's dance to a
very high degree.  It was desired that a fiddle should be play-
ed on in the presence of the affected person.  It was not
regular music that gave relief, but the striking of certain
strings, which the person under agitation, desired should be
struck again.  The effect was astonishing; the person affect-
ed, became quiet, sat down, and in a little, asked to be put
