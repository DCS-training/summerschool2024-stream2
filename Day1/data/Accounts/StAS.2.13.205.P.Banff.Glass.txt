	   In spring, besides our more common plants,

	Mercurialis perennis 	Oxalis acetosella            Chryaosplenium oppositifo-
	Primula vulgaris        Cardamine birsuta              lium.
	Asperula odorata        Draba verna                  Viola palustris, &c.
	Anemone nemorosa        Tussilago farfara
	Ranunculus Ficaria      Fragaria vesca

	   The Adoxa moschatellina, Chrysosplenium alternifolium, and
	Arenaria verna, as of greater rarity, claim particular notice. The
	first, although by no means a common plant, has been found in a
	wood opposite to the manse, giving out its characteristic and
	agreeable odour. The second, seldom seen in the neighbour-
	hood, in some places unites its gold-en blossoms with those of its
	brother species, to grace the sides of shaded springs; and the
	last, although not new to the country, can be found in few places
	in greater perfection than on some serpentine rock in the upper
	part of the parish.
	   The long and uninteresting list of the more frequent summer
	and autumn plants, it would be useless to enumerate. The follow-
	ing, however, as of rarer occurrence, seem to deserve more parti-
	cular remark:

	Viola lutca                  Sedurn villosurn             Teesdalia nudicaulis
	Gentiana campestris          Trollius Europmus            Anchusa sempervivum
	Polygonum viviparum          Hypericurn humifusum         Myrrhis odorata
	Pyrola media                 ----------. hirsutum,        Senecio saracenicus.
	-------minor                 Cnicus heterophillus

	   The three latter are found in the neighbourhood of Apwanly,
	and have at one time been probably cultivated in the garden, al-
	though now growing at some distance from it.

				II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
	   It is worthy of notice, that the maternal great-grandfather of
	Henry Lord Brougham, Mr Walter Sim, was minister here about
	the beginning of last century, and was thence translated to the
	neighbouring parish of Mortlach, where he died.
	   Land-owners.-These are, the Earl of Fife;.  Trustees of the
	late James Earl of Fife; and Mr Grant, a minor, nephew of the
	late Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls, proprietor of the
	lands of Beldorney, formerly belonging to the Gordons of Ward-
	house and Kildrummy, of which latter family, Rear-Admiral Sir
	James A. Gordon is a son.
	   Two of the "aught-an'-furty " davochs, of the lordship of
	Huntly are located in this parish, but were alienated by gift to
	two of the meritorious vassals of the chief of the Gordon family;
	that of Apwanly to Calder, after the battle of Brechin ; and that
