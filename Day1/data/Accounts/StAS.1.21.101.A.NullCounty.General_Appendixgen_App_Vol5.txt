most difficult to be kept in repair, the expence of the latter
part cannot exceed what is in proportion to the former, and
may therefore be stated at L. 3:12.
   Another turnpike road from Barskimming Bridge, passes
through two corners of Ochiltree parish, on the N. W. and
its length in the parish is 2 miles, wanting 44 falls.  Con-
cerning this road, which from being less frequented needs
less repair, we have heard that only L. 10 was once ex-
pended on it, since it was made about 14 years ago.  How-
ever, we will not omit to observe, that in this present year
1794, L. 3 hath been expended in the repairing of it.
   Another turnpike road from Stair Bridge leading towards
Dalmellington, and joining the last mentioned road, passes
through three corners of Ochiltree parish, and its length in
the parish is 2 miles and 57 falls.  The parts of this road
also which are in Ochiltree, are conjointly repaired with
those which are in Stair; and though it is said that some
of these parts have not received repair every year, and though
in fact they do not need so much repair as the first road,
yet we shall estimate the expence of their reparation accord-
ing to the rate of the first road, at L. 11:4 annually.
   The overplus of stature money or annual remainder, after
the expence of foresaid repairs, it hath been thought by
the parishioners of Ochiltree, should be laid out in repair-
ing parish or cross roads, which are most wretchedly bad,
and on which no statute money hath hitherto been ex-
pended.  That such roads should be repaired by the sta-
tute money seems to be the opinion of Colonel Fullarton,
who, in his Georgical Account of Ayrshire, says, (p. 39,)
'the turnpike roads are made and repaired by the produce
'of the tolls, and the cross roads by the statute labour of
'the different parishes.'  And in the act of Parliament con-
cerning roads in Ayrshire, (p. 26.) it is said, 'The whose
