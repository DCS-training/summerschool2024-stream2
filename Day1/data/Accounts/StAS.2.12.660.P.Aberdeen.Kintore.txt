by Aberdeen, and the roads leading from some of the principal pas-
ses of the Grampians, met.
   The mansion-house of Thainston is the only private modern
building of any consideration in the parish.  It is a handsome and
commodious family residence, in style and extent suitable to the
property.  The situation is particularly interesting, and the view
from it very extensive.

                           III.-POPULATION.
   By the return made to Dr Webster, the number of inhabitants
in the parish of Kintore was 830.  Immediately before the an-
nexation of a part of Kinkell in 1760, it was between 700 and 800,
and about 200 were added by that event.  By the former Statis-
tical Account, it was 862.

   The number of inhabitants in the burgh is 462; in the land-
ward parish, 725; in the village of Port Elphinstone, 112.  But in
the late Government census, this last section of the population of
Kintore is by mistake included in the parish of Inverury, owing
to the circumstance that Port Elphinstone falls within the ex-
tended Parliamentary boundaries of that burgb.
   There are no fewer than three fatuous or imbecile persons in
the parish, all paupers; and two others, a boy and girl, who to
appearance are simpletons, though not entirely incapable of in-
struction; these also are supported from the parochial funds.  At
present, there is but one insane person connected with Kintore, and
he is kept in the Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum at the charge of his
friends.
   In the customs and recreations of the people of this place there
is nothing peculiar.  These are the same as in the surrounding
district.  It appears, however, that, in ancient times, Kintore was
the scene of a higher order of amusements, and boasted of a race-
course.  On this subject Arthur Johnston has the following lines:

         Hic locus hippodromi est, populo spectante quotannis,
               Hic alacres pubis Scotica versat equos,
           Hic fugit, hic sequitur; victori praemia cedunt,
                Quae palmas superant, Elidis ora! tuas.
