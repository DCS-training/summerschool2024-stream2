tion from the town-council, about the year 1720, or betwixt
1720 and 1730.  Each person, upon entering, pays 2 L. 2s.
6 d. to the funds of the burgh, besides what he pays to those
of his own society or incorporation.

   Peculiar Law.-There is a remarkable bye-law of this com-
munity, made in 1695, which the members of council must
annually take an oath to observe, By it they bind them-
selves, to take no lease of any part of the public property,
under their management, nor to purchase any part of it;
neither to receive any gratification out of the public funds,
under pretence of a reward for their trouble, in going about
the affairs of the borough, or of the hospitals founded in it.
By this bye-law, also, a board of auditors is elected annually,
for inspecting the public accounts, consisting of 2 members
chosen by the merchants at large, and 2 chosen in like manner
by the seven royal incorporations,

   Castle, etc.-None can tell, when the castle was built, any
more than the town, Even the bridge, which is doubtless a
work of much later date, has no memorial of the date of its
erection.  The whole town stands upon a rock, stretching
from N. E. to S. W.; and, with the castle, situated on the
utmost prominence of the rock, towards the north, very
much resembles the ridge on which the high street and
castle of Edinburgh are situated.  Several of the houses in
Stirling, now standing, are doubtless of very ancient date.
In one, which was lately taken down, on the south side of the
broad street, there was a stone marked IIII.-Mar's Work, a
large and aukward edifice, was begun by the Earl of that
name, anno 1570, while he was regent of Scotland, but ne-
ver finished.  The tenement, called Argyll's Lodging, was built
partly in the year 1637, by Alexander, Viscount of Stir-
ling.
