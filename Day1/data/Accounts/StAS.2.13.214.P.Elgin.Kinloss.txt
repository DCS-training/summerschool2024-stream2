             Inns.-Of licensed public-houses and whisky shops, there is a
        superabundant number, no fewer than 13. That they have a de-
	moralising tendency is most apparent.

             			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
              From the preceding statements it may be seen, that the state of
        this parish in regard both to its agricultural, mercantile, and educa-
	tional resources, has been considerably improved within half a centu-
	ry. By the attention that is paid to the system of farming and breed
	of stock, husbandry has been carried to a much higher degree of
	perfection-the means of communication by roads and bridges
	have become more ample-tbe education, dress, lodging, have be-
	come greatly meliorated, and an appearance of cultivation, beauty,
	and prosperity, has been given to the whole aspect of the parish,
        which it did not before possess. The improvements on the coast
        have kept pace with those in the interrior. The harbour accom-
        modation has been enlarged and the shipping increased. Of the
	houses built, both in town and country, the outward appearance
	and internal arrangements are vastly superior to the old, and the
	seafaring as well as the agricultural population, the tradesmen
	and the peasantry, are better educated, better fed, better clad,
	and better accommodated, than used to be the generation of their
        fathers. The tide of prosperity which has thus so rapidly flowed
	in commerce and agriculture, has, it is to be hoped, been accom-
	panied by progressive advancement in the cultivation of the
        moral soil, and the attainment of what is the true riches,-the ex-
	cellence of Christian character.
