   River, Lakes, Animals.  Minerals, etc.-Besides the com-
mon domestic animals, foxes, badgers, pole-cats, hares, otters,
and rabbits, are found in this parish; also eagles, hawks,
muirfowl, woodcocks, partridges, plovers and snipes. The
river of Evelicks, which falls into the sea near the Meikle
Ferry, affords a few salmon and trouts.  The hilly part of
the parish contains 3 or 4 small lakes, in which a variety of
trouts are found.  The largest of there lakes may be about a
mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad.  One of them
produces a fine red trout, which weighs from 1/2 pound to 1 1/2
pound.  The parish is not destitute of common stone quarries.
At Embo there is one of free-stone.  There is no natural

there are thriving plantations of fir, though of no great extent.
At Evelicks, some appearances of coal have been observed;
and about a mile to the N. W. of Dornoch is found a very
rich clay.  It is extremely hard to dig; the pick must go be-

pitch.  When used in building, it takes an equal quantity of
sand.

   Agriculture and Produce.-The crops raised here, are
oats, bear, pease, potatoes, and some beans and rye.  About the
year 1758, potatoes became a principal article of provision
here.  Now, they serve as the chief subsistence of the people
during a third part of the year; with many for one half, and
