proprietors nobly stept forth for the support of their poorer
brethren in that calamitous year.  In some parishes, they
sent money to kirk sessions to be distributed according to
the necessities of the poor.  In others, they imported grain
from foreign countries, and sold it out to them at a reduced
price.  The scarcity of that year has had no effect on our
voluntary collections at the church door; they are much the
same at present that they were then: neither has it tended
to render the people less scrupulous in applying for parish
support;
   There were very few sectarists in this parish 40 years ago,
at present they amount to 99.  The despotism of the law of
patronage has driven great numbers, and is still driving more
and more every year from the established church.  These sec-
tarists never contribute one farthing towards the support of
our poor.  We make however no distinction between them
and our own people; when they fall into distress, they ob-
tain supplies from the ordinary parish funds, in the same pro-
portion with those of our own community.  From the session
records, I see that the sectarists have all along been the great-
est burden upon our funds.  There are four families of them
at this present moment, each of whom have been receiving
annually 40 s. sterling for these 20 years.  It is justice then,
and the call of humanity that they should contribute towards
the maintenance of our poor, in the same proportion with
the rest of the inhabitants of the parish.  But under the pre-
sent existing laws, there is no way of bringing them in but
by a parochial assessment upon the heritors and householders;
and this I am very averse to on many accounts, but particu-
larly, because I am persuaded that it tends to encourage idle-
ness and vice among the lower classes of the people.  The
dread of poverty is the great, and almost only incentive to
action.  Remove that dread and they cease to be industrious.
