into service.  On these days, the concourse of people being great,
and beyond what is known on the like occasions in any part of
Scotland, it is productive of immense profits to the shopkeep-
ers, milliners, etc. among whom they lay out incredible sums
of moneys principally for wearing apparel, and female orna-
ments.  The other six high market days are in March and
the end of autumn; the former for purchasing horses for
summer work, such as, driving lime, coal, etc.; which be-

owing to the high price of fodder at this season.
   There are three fairs in the parish, including St. James's,
which is held on the 5th of August; two in the town, one
of these on the 10th of July, the other on the 2 d of No-
vember.  When these fairs were established, they were wise-
ly designed; the first was for buying lean cattle, to be fed
during the summer and autumn months, upon meadow and
pasture ground; and, when fat, they were brought to market,
and sold for winter and spring food, called Marts, being im-
mediately killed and salted.  In these days, fresh meat was
not to be got during winter; but, since the introduction of
turnip husbandry, the market is plentifully supplied with the
very best fed cattle during the whole year.  The summer
fair being no longer of its original use, it would be a great
advantage to the stockholders, to have it altered to the end
of August; this would suit dealers in cattle to purchase, at a
convenient time, to drive them south to Woolpitt market,
held in September.  Fairs ought to succeed one another from
north to south, until stocks arrive in London, the ne plus
ultra.  The great concourse of people, of all descriptions,
who attend the weekly markets, is the principal source from
whence the inhabitants derive their support; but, of all o-
ther ranks in society, they are most obliged to the farmers,
who come here in great numbers to sell immense quantities
