   Miscellaneous Observations.-Though both soil and climate,
in their present state, are unpropitious to improvements,
there is no doubt that the modern plans of husbandry might
be carried on with success.  To do this, the most likely me-
thod would be to plant wood, in such proportions and direc-
tions as might most effectually break the violence of storms,
and thereby prevent the roots of the young plants from being
torn up or broken, and the ripened grain from being shaken
out.  For poor grain, and unproductive crops, are more ow-
ing to the autumnal winds, than either to poverty of soil, or
severity of climate.  This would necessarily lead to the ma-
king of inclosures, the advantages of which are well known
to every farmer in the more cultivated parts of the country.
Besides the improvement and increase of grain, and the me-
lioration of summer pasture, by the young grass and clover
being saved and sheltered in winter, abundance of better food
might be raised for the winter subsistence of sheep and cattle,
and a superior breed of both might be thus introduced, to
the great emolument both of landlord and tenant.
   It is surprising, that the proprietors here practise so little
the elegant and permanent improvement of wood and inclo-
sure, especially as they seem, in other respects, well disposed
to encourage their tenants in meliorating the grounds, and
increasing the quantity and value of the productions, by pur-
chasing manure, and making of roads.
