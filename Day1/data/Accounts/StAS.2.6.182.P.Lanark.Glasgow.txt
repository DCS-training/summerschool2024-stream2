are similar ones in the suburbs, with about 1200 students. In the
Calton 450 students attended the natural philnsophy class, of whom
nine-tenths were operatives; 200 females attended the astronomy
and geography classes, seven-tenths of whom were mill girls.
From the foregoing facts let not the friends of elementary educa-
tion undervalue the acquirements of science, nor the friends of
science the benefits of a moral and religious education. It is true
that the one does not embrace scientific instruction, and the other
does not profess to impart moral and religious knowledge, but both
contribute to improve and exalt the human character, and are there-
fore essential elements in a national education. Dr Chalmers has
observed, that Christianity has every thing to hope and nothing to
fear from the advancement of science, and he affords in his own
character a striking instance of the benefits of scientific knowledge,
ennobling the intellect, and adorning the Christian character.
	Newspapers.--The first newspaper published in the west of Scot-
land was the Glasgow Courant, which appeared in the year 1715.
It was published three times a-week, consisted of twelve pages in
small quarto, and was sold for three-halfpence, or "one penny to
regular customers." The second number contained a letter from
Provost Aird, Colonel of the regiment of Glasgow Volunteers, de-
tailing his views in regard to the Duke of Argyll's ultimate success
at Sheriffmuir. The name of the paper was soon ch`nged to that
of the West Country Intelligence, which only survived a few years.
From 1715 till the present time, there have been twenty-one at-

their commencement, and the periods of publication, are as fol-
lows:--The Glasgow `Courant in 1715; the Journal in 1729;
the Chronicle in 1775; the Mercury in 1779; the Advertise in
1783; but in 1804 its name was changed to that of the Herald;
the Courier n 1791; the Clyde Commercial Advertiser in 1805;
the Caledonia in 1807; but in the same year it merged in the
Western Star; the Sentinel in 1809; a second Chronicle in 1811;
the Scotsman in 1812; the Packet in 1813; a second Sentinel in
1821; the Free Press in 1823; the Scots Times in 1825; the
Evening Post n 1827; the Trades' Advocate in 1829; the Libera-
tor in 1831; the Scottish Guardian and the Argus in 1832; and
