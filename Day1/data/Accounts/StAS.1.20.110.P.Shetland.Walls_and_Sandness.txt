   Schools.-In the island of Papa there is a mortification
of three merks of land, by a piously disposed person, for
the purpose of benefiting a reader in the church, who ca-
techises the people there; reads a religious book on the
Lord's day; sings and prays, when the minister cannot at-
tend for public worship.-There is a parochial school esta-
blished in Walls, and the Rev. Mr Buchan modified 40 s. per
ann. besides the legal salary (L. 10 Sterl.) In the island of
Fowla there is a charity-school, with a very small salary, of
only L. 3 Sterl. per ann.-Several itinerant preachers were
settled in this and some neighbouring islands, who officiated
a part of the year in each.  These islands, lying at the dis-
tance of seven or eight leagues from their respective mini-
stries, were frequently deprived of the stated ordinances of
worship.  But, by residing a great part of the year among
the peoples these itinerants were of much advantage to
them.  It is a long time since they were withdrawn, and
the people have of course much degenerated in their morals
and Christian knowledge; at least this is the case with
Fowls; for the minister has been accustomed to go only once
a-year, in mid-summer, to that island, where he stays eight or
ten days: during which time he frequently preaches, cate-
chises the inhabitants, and baptises their childern.  But all
his ministerial labours among them, in so short a time, can
be of small advantage for their information, and for guiding
them in the path of duty.  Now that the society is put in
a capacity, from the late acqusition of their funds, for ex-
tending their beneficence and humane influence, it would
surely be fulfilling their pious aims in an effectual manner,
were an itinerant again appointed to there islands.  The cha-
rity-schoolmaster reads, during the year, to the inhabitants,
every Sabbath-day, in some religious book, furnished by the
minister.-There was a charity-school erected in Sandness,
