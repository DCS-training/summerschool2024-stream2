culation, there are annually employed in raising turnips 40
acres; pease and beans 30; sown or artificial grasses 200;
potatoes 10; wheat 27; slax 5; bear and barley 311;
oats 157.  There are 6 principal farms; the largest of 
which does not exceed 144 acres of arable land, and the 
smallest not under 25.  There are also 12 other racks or 
subtacks, the largest of which is 20 acres, and the smallest 
only 5.  There are 16 ploughs, 61 horses, and some oxen;
employed in farming; also 16 ploughmen, about 12 maid-
servants, 12 boys, and 10 barn-men, besides the farmers,
or tenants themselves, some of whom manage or work
a plough with their own hands.  Within these 12 years,
very considerable improvements have taken place, and al-
most a total alteration in the appearance of the fields, and 
quality of the soil; the farms being made more compact
by excambion, and the fields much improved by liming,
manuring, and straighting.  The good effects of these im-
provements are perfectly obvious, from the rise of land-
rent; for about a third part of the parish, (lying below the 
high-road, and contiguous to the sea-coast), is now let from
L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2 the acre, whereas it formerly yielded
the proprietor no more than 10 s. or 12 s.  Nor does it
appear, that farmers are now less rich and wealthy 
than formerly; their manner of living evinces rather the 
contrary.  There are only 2 proprietors in the parish; the 
Viscount Arbuthnot and Mr Barclay of ury; the latter 
of whom is a very spirited and judicious farmer:  He was
the first who introduced a proper mode of husbandry and 
culture in this part of the country; he prescribed and laid 
down to his tenants certain rules for the management of 
their farms, to which they are obliged to adhere by the 
tenor of their tacks, by which means he not only increa-
sed the value of his property, but enabled the farmer to
live more comfortably and easy.  The farmers in general
