   The arrangement with the creditors was, that for every hundred
pounds of debt they were to receive a bond bearing three pounds
of perpetual annuity-that these bonds were to be transferable,
and the debt redeemable only by the payment of the full sum, or
by purchasing the bonds at their market value. The revenues
and the properties belonging to the city were divided into two
classes. The first class contains all the alienable revenues, which
are conveyed in security to the creditors for the payment of their
annuities. The gross amount of this sum was calculated at the
time to amount to L. 17,554, including an annuity of L. 3180
payable from the harbour of Leith; and after deducting L. 1600
as the expense of management, the net produce was taken at
L. 15,954. The claim of the creditors of three per cent on the
whole amount of their debts amounted to L. 12,000, secured over
the above sum.
   The second class contains the inalienable revenues, which are
specially secured to the city, and declared by the act not to be
liable, either directly or indirectly, for any debts or obligations
contracted by the city prior to the 1st of January 1833, when it
was declared to be bankrupt. The gross amount of this sum is
L. 5030; the net produce L. 4294.
   The following abstract of the revenues of the city for the year
1841-2 will exhibit the actual revenue at this date, as well as the
various sources from whence the sums alluded to in the above two
classes are obtained:-
Revenues of the city from 1st August 1841 to 1st August 1842,
  under Schedule A, over the whole of which the security to the
  statutory creditors of the city extends.
