five or six leagues.  Corresponding to this, on the west side,
at a seemingly-equal distance, appears the greatest part of the
romantic Island of Arran, with its still more lofty and tre-
mendous mountains, and broken creeks.  Between this
Island and Garrick, the sea opens unbounded to the eye;
and the beautiful regular rock Ailza appears, as if set down
exactly in the middle of the opening, about 40 miles distant.

   Sea Coast.-The five miles line of shore is quite a sandy
beech, on which the sea deepens in the most gradual manner
imaginable.  Hence, during a westerly storm, it is formi-
dable to such ships as have the misfortune to be here em-
bayed, as they strike the ground at a considerable distance
from the shore, which is covered with a dangerous surf.
The sandy beech begins at Saltcoats, and sweeps round by
Irvine, along the whole coast of Kyle, for more than 20
miles, to the mouth of the river Doon or Dune beyond Ayr;
interrupted only by a small peninsula of rocky ground at the
Trune.  The coast of Carrick, beginning at Doon, is rocky,
as is likewise the coast of Cunningham northward from Salt-
coats towards Greenock.  The Harbours of Aye and Irvine
within their respective rivers, the mouth of which is crossed
by a bar or bank of sand, cannot be entered but at spring
tides; and the harbour of Saltcoats, which is a natural ones
at an ordinary tide; and none of the three can at any time
admit ships above 220 tons burden.  Accordingly, when
they are checked within this bay by a westerly storm, which
sometimes continues for several days together, it is impossible
for them to make the safe road of Lamlash in Arran, on the
west, and equally so to clear the rocky shore of Cunningham,
and the point of Pencross, six miles N. W. of Saltcoats, in
order to get shelter in the Fairlie Road.  There is only one
particular place in this open bay, which will afford them
