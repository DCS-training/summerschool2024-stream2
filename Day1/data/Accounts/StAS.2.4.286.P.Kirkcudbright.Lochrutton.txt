			PARISH OF LOCHRUTTON.

		FRESBYTARY OF DUMFRIES, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

		   THE REV. THOMAS INGLIS, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--LOCHRUTTON derives its name from a lake or loch in
the centre of the parish. The word Rutton is supposed to sig.
nify, in the Gaelic language, the straight road. The great road
to Ireland through the Stewartry of Kircudbright formerly passed
close by this loch. This road is now  little frequented, a new
and better line having been formed many years ago. The new
road passes also through the parish, and at a short distance from
the loch.
	Boundaries, Figure, and Extent.--The parish is of a elliptical
form, and is computed to contain 13 1/2 square miles; being 4 1/2 long,
from east to west; and 3 broad, from north to south. It is bound-
ed by the parishes of New Abbey and Troquire, on the south
and east; Terregles and Irongray, on the north; Urr and Kirk-
gvuzeon, on the west. Towards its boundaries on the south, east,
and west the land rises, forming a sort of undulating ring round
the parish in these parts, but falling towards the north.  These
high grounds are mostly amble. The rest of the parish lies in
a valley consisting of amble land, interspersed with knolls, mos-
ses and meadows.
	 Hydrography.--The lake or loch from which the parish has its
name, extends to 123 acres, 2 roods, and 4 falls Scots statute
measure. It is a mile in length, and at an average about a mile
in breadth, and twelve feet in depth. In the middle of it, there
is a small island about half a rood in extent, and of a circular form.
