     Observations on the preceding Table

   The total of the first column is 85 parishes or districts, having 89 Mini-
sters: The parish of Cushnie having been lately annexed to that of Leochel,
the number is now reduced to 84 districts, and 88 Ministers.

The total of the second column, or population in 1755,    116,836
The total of the third column, or population in 1790-7,   122,921

Increase,                                                   6,085

The increase on the whole, column fourth,                  16,904
The decrease on the whole, column fifth,                   10,819

   It is here to be observed, that though part of the parishes of Cairny and
Cabrach, lies in Banff-shire, and part of the parish of Drumoak, in the
county of Kincardine, the whole population of each of these parishes is
set down in the Table, from the difficulty of apportioning the number
of inhabitants to each respective county, therefore the real population of
the country of Aberdeen is somewhat less than above state.
   The increase has almost exclusively taken place in Aberdeen, Peterhead,
Huntly, Fraserburgh, and the other towns, whilst it would appear, that the
population of most of the country parishes has diminished.  The number
of inhabitants of the towns is about 27,833, viz.
