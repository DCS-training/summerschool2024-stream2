sition of a legal stent for maintaining the poor, the non-re-
siding heritors, and the members of the Burgher congrega-
tion voluntarily contribute 22 L. 5 s. Sterling, annually, which;
with the interest of 83 L. stock, the weekly collections, and the
mortcloth money, usually makes up the sum of 66 L. Sterling.
This sum is found sufficient, for the maintenance of the poor,
when the prices of provisions are moderate: On extraordinary
occasions, the charity of individuals, of every rank, is liberal.
The kirk-session takes the entire management, of the poor's
money, but they submit an exact statement of their expendi-
ture, every half year, to the heritors: Upon these occasions,
the poor's-roll is made up, and when it is necessary, the mem-
bers of the Burgher session, report the state of the paupers
attached to their congregation.

   Libraries.-The inhabitants of this parish, have given a
good specimen of their character and taste, in the institution of
two libraries, supported by an annual subscription, and con-
taining a judicious selection of books, entertaining, historical,
moral, and religious.
   For the prices of labour and provisions, with other articles
of the same kind; reference is made to the statistical accounts,
of contiguous parishes.
