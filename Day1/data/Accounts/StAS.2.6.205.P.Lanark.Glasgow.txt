canal is on a level line for 30 miles from-Port Hopetoun,--the re-
maining distance is occupied by 11 locks, each 10 feet deep, so
that the Union Canal at the head of the locks is 110 feet above
the Forth and Clyde Navigation. The Union Canal is 40 feet
broad at the top, 20 feet at the bottom, and 5 feet deep. This
canal has not yet been productive to such stockholders as have not
an interest in the Forth and Clyde Navigation.
	The Garnkirk Railway from Glasgow to near Airdrie was par-
tially opened on the 2d of July 1831. On 1st February 1832, the
locomotive engine, the "Glasgow," built by Messrs Johnston and
M'Nab of this city, hauled a train of 36 loaded coal waggons 8 1/4
miles, a gross weight of about 145 tons, in 1 hour and 7 minutes, thus
carrying a load of twenty times her own weight. This was the first
locomotive engine made in Scotland on the improved construction.
	Stage-coaches.--Stage-coaches were first used in Scotland in
1678. The first mail-coach from London to Glasgow arrived at
the Saracen's Head on Monday the 7th of July 1788. At that
period the mail went by Leeds, a distance of 405 miles, and ar-
rived in 65 hours, travelling at nearly 6 1/2 miles in the hour; in 1835
the mail goes by Wetherby, a distance of 395 miles, and arrives in
41 3/4 hours. The speed from Carlisle to Glasgow is at the rate of
11 miles an hour. On the 10th of January 1799, Mr John Gard-
ner of the Bucks Head, Glasgow, started a coach to Edinburgh
with four horses, which performed the journey of 42 miles in 6
hours. The time now occupied on the road by stage-coaches is
about 4 1/2 hours.
	In 1833 there were on an average 61 stage coaches, which de-
parted from, and returned to Glasgow, every lawful day. The
mails every day are,--to London, 2; Edinburgh, 12; Paisley, 13;
Hamilton, 5; Lanark, 3; Perth, 2; Stirlii3g, 2 and to other
towns, 22. These coaches were drawn by 183 horses, and 671
horses are kept for them. They accommodated 832 passengers;
viz. inside 284, outside 548.
	The intercourse with Glasgow by coaches, steam-boats, track-
boats, and rail-roads is so great that it almost exceeds belief. As
some of the coaches and steam-boats depart and arrive more than
once a-day, and the mail-coaches every day, the following may be
taken as a low average of passengers by stage-coaches, and steam-
boats; while the others are from the books of the respective com-
panies. During 1834, 61 stage-coahes, each averaging twelve
possengers, arrived and departed during 131 lawful days. this
