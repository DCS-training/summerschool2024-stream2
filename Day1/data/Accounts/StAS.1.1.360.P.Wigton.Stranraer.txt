been much checked by inoculation, which is frequently prac-
tised both in the town and in the country.  Many of the in-

upwards.

   Trade and Fisheries.-In the year 1764 there were only
two vessels belonging to the town, of 30 or 35 tons each;
but now the tonnage of the port is about 1200 tons, compo-
sed of vessels from 15 or 20 to 100 tons each; there is one of
upwards of 150 tons.  This shipping is generally employed
in the different branches of the coasting trade, and in the
herring fishery.  This last branch of trade was pushed with
great success for many years by the inhabitants of Stranraer;
but, for the last seven or eight years, they have been greatly

vessels went to the Highland fishery, and returned with very
poor cargoes; some with only 3 or 4 barrels; and none with
more than a quarter cargo:  Formerly 16 or 17 vessels have
gone out and returned full laden.  Besides the coasting trade
and fishery, some of the largest vessels have lately gone an-
nually to Norway, Gottenburgh, and the Baltie, either on
freight, or on account of their owners here.  Considerable
quantities of deals, plank, large timber, and iron have been
imported.  These articles are disposed of in the country
and town for building, &c.; a great part of them is em-
ployed in ship-building.  The herring fishery in Lochryan

ther in great numbers from every quarter, the inhabitants of
every description found employment, and wealth poured in
upon them.  The fishery is now much decreased.  The her-
rings make their appearance generally some time in Septem-
ber, continue two or three months, appearing and disappear-
