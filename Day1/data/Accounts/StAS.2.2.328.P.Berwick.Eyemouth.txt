   Rent of Land, &c.-The average rent of arable land in the parish
is L. 3, 10s. The duration of the leases is in some cases twelve,
and in others nineteen years, the principal farm being let on a lease
of twenty-one years. The lands are all in the highest state of cul-
tivation, and, as may be inferred from the rent named, they are of
the first quality. The sheep and cattle kept are commonly of
the Leicester and short-horned or Teeswater breed. They are
generally bought in to be fed or grass or turnips, very few being
bred in the parish.
   Rate of Labour.-The rate of labour is for men during summer,
1s. 8d. per day; and for women, 1s.; and during winter for men,
1s. 6d.; and for women, 10d. Joiners and masons are paid from
3s. to 3s. 6d. a-day in summer, and 2s. 6d. a-day in winter.
   Produce.-The gross annual value of produce, on an average of
the last five years, may be stated as follows: viz.

   Fisheries.-It is exceedingly difficult to state the annual value
of the fisheries in the parish, as it is necessarily very fluctuating.
The cod and haddock fishery is prosecuted by nine boats, each of
which is manned by six men; the yearly produce of whose labour,
in this department, may be stated at L. 1890. The herring fishery
has also at various periods been very productive; from 1809 to
1820, not less than 10,000 barrels being brought into Eyemouth
yearly. * Upon these occasions, from 100 to 150 boats assembled
at Eyemouth, and few sights more gratifying could be witnessed,
than that of the little fleet setting sail on a fine summer even-
ing, to take up their stations on the fishing ground, or returning at
break of day, loaded with the treasures of the deep. Since 1820

<FOOTNOTE>During these years, the prices of fresh herrings ranged between 10s. and 15s.
per barrel: cured herrings brought from L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 12s., according to quality.
