     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF HOLME.

     (COUNTY OF ORKNEY.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES ALISON.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Surface, and Sea Coast.

   THE word Holme is of Danish origin, and is descriptive
of the local situation of the parish, which stretches
along the meandering banks of that beautiful and well fre-
quented frith, to which it gives the name of Holme Sound,
leading from the Caledonian to the German sea, by Strom-
ness.  It belongs to the presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod
of Orkney, and was formerly a part of that bishoprick.  It
is situated 4 miles distant from the town of Kirkwall, on
the S. E. side of Pamona, or Main Land, and declines gen-
tly to the south.  From its position, detached from the
scenes of bustling life, nothing but a bare recital of ordina-
ry incidents can be expected.  it extends 6 Scotch miles
from W. to E. in length, and between 1 and 2 in breadth
