     Statistical Account

   Epidemical Diseases.-No local distempers, or sickness of any
kind, are prevalent in the parish.  In the months of Febru-
ary and March, indeed, some fevers appear among the people
of low circumstances, especially in that district of the parish
which lies in the narrowest part of the valley; but these seem
chiefly owing to poor living, and bad accommodation, during
the winter season, and perhaps to the dampness of the pre-
ceding months.

   Manufactures.-It was before mentioned, that there are
neither towns nor villages in the parish, but that the inhabi-
tants live in detached houses; manufactures, therefore, can-
not well exist in this district.  The dearness of fuel is an-
other obstacle:  Peats are bad, scarce, and consequently dear;
and coals are either carted 24 miles land carriage, or brought
from England by water.  These last would be moderately
cheap, were it not for the high duties laid on them, which
are as fatal to the improvement of this, as they are to many
other parts of Scotland; nor can this part of the country
ever greatly improve, until these duties be abolished.

   Population.-On the last day of the year 1790, there were
living in the parish of Holywood 736 persons, of whom there
were,
