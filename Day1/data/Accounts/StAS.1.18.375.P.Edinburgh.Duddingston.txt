in it prolifically, and form one of its picturesque ornaments.
The fish which are found in the lake, are pike, perch, and a
profusion of eels; twenty dozen of which have been killed in
an evening, by the aid of a barbed spear, trident, or rather
sexdent.  Carp and tench had been imported by the Earl of
Abercorn, to store his canals and ponds; but have now for

are also the same which are common on the shores of the
Forth.  Scalps of excellent oysters, are said to lie opposite to
the Portobello beach.  Mussels, spout or razor fish, are also

such high request at the Roman tables.  The sea hedge-hog,
another article of ancient luxury, (echinus aesculens of Lin-
naeus), is also found upon the sands.  And in a sort black

a building of considerable antiquity.  Dr Littleton, when
Bishop of Carlisle, and upon a visit to the lord of the manor,
concluded probably from the structure of the arches, and the
stile of the ornaments, that it must have been the work of
the Saxons.  There is no record, however, authority or date,
