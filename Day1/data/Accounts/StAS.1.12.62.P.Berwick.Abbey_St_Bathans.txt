grain, wheat not excepted.  Besides the haugh lands, there
are, in many of the higher parts of the parish, considerable
quantities of the land in tillage, the greater part of which
has been improved by lime brought from East Lothian; and,
in favourable seasons, the farmer commonly finds a very good
return.  The soil is light and dry.  Though, from the ele-
vated situation of the parish, the climate is cold, yet it is in
general healthy, and few diseases prevail among the inhabi-
tants.

   River.-The only river in the parish is Whitadder, which
is here a considerable stream, being about 15 miles from its
source, and having received, in its course, the river Dye, the
rivulet Monnynuk, and numberless other smaller ones.  It
abounds with plenty of trouts, and affords excellent sport to
the angler.  Salmon and sea-trout are sometimes found in it
in summer, though seldom in great quantities.  Prodigious
numbers of them come up during the prohibited months for
fishing, and lodge their spawn in the channel of the river.
There is but too much reason to regret, that the inhabitants
destroy them at that time, as it tends both to injure their own,
health, by making use of the fish in the weak and unhealthy
state in which they then are, and is a great prejudice to the
salmon-fishing in the river Tweed.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls then, was 80.  There are at present 164 inha-
bitants in the parish, of whom 85 are males, and 79 females;
all of whom, except a few mechanics, are employed in pur-
poses of husbandry, either as day-labourers, hired servants to
farmers, or shepherds.  They are in general sober, frugal,
and industrious, and are contented with their situation.  When
