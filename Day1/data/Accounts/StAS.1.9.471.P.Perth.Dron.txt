miles south, from whence they are usually brought in carts
during summer, for the supply of all this country south of
Perth.  There is no moss nearer than 8 or 9 miles.  This
scarcity of fuel is severely felt by the lower classes of the peo-
ple, who having neither cattle nor carriages of their own,
must purchase it from others who have, at a dear rate.

   Agriculture, etc.-The soil in the lower division of the
parish, though various, according as it approaches to the bot-
tom of the hills, or the level of the Strath, is in general
strong and fertile, consisting partly of clay, till, and loam,
producing plentiful crops of wheat, beans, pease, barley,
grass, oats, which is the usual rotation observed here.  Tur-
nip and potato are not yet raised in any great quantities,
still less cabbage and yams.  The nature of the soil does
not seem adapted for the culture of flax, being too stiff and
moist; little therefore is raised, except for domestic use.
The soil of those farms which lie on the hills is of a lighter
kind, shallow and interspersed with rock, lying at the bot-
tom of the furrow, and frequently jutting out above the
surface.  But in the flats and hollows the soil is good, and
produces very tolerable crops, chiefly of barley and oats,
pease only in small quantities.  Of late wheat has been
cultivated with success, as also grass.  Large tracts, how-
ever, in these farms are unfit for cultivation, and only af-
ford an extensive range of indifferent pasture for cattle.
No sheep are now kept there, though the pasture is better
adapted for that usefull species of animals than any other,
because they are so apt to stray into the neighbouring inclo-
sures, and so injurious to fences.  From the elevated situa-
tion of these farms, they are much exposed to suffer from
high winds and late harvests.-Improvements in agricul-
