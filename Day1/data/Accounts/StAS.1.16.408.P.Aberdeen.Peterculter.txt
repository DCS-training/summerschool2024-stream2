founds the ideas of justice, changes humanity into cruelty,
and all order into confusion.  It is in vain, therefore, to as-
sert, that the people of Britain are incapable of the barba-
rities perpetrated in France.  The contrary is well known.
Political rage, the love of power, and thirst of lucre, trans-
form men into savage monsters.  The engaging timidity
of the fair sex is lost in more than masculine hardiness;
the use of the cudgel is substituted for the exercise of the
fan; and their musical accents converted into hectoring
vociferations.
   To conclude:  After considering French principles and
politics, as explained by their practice, the best interpreter;
after contemplating their views of universal depredation
and self aggrandizement; I must conclude, that it were
better for every Briton able to bear arms, to step forward
in defence of our invaluable privileges, and resolutely die
in the struggle, than submit to the French.  It were
better for posterity that Great Britain were turned into a
desart, and they forced to seek an asylum among untutored
Indians, than become a section of the French Republic.
These sentiments may be thought unbecoming the clerical
character.  I do not think it.  All Christians are expressly
required to lay down their lives, rather than renounce their
religion; and where can we lay them down more proper-
ly than in the field, against the enemies of truth, who bring
in destructive heresies, denying the Lord that bought them?
The spirit of the gospel is indeed the spirit of peace, but it
is at the same time the spirit of heroism.
