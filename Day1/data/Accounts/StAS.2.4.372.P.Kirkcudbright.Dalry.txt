				IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The crops chiefly grown are barley, oats, turnips,
potatoes, and some rye. In proportion to the extent of the parish,
which is pastoral, the cultivated land is small, though increasing.
Surface drains are made to a considerable extent, and are found to
benefit the pasture, and where drains are put in meadows the hay
is improved as well as increased. Limeworks are from twenty to
thirty miles distant. The roads are now generally improved and
much extended throughout the parish. Breeding and rearing sheep
and black-cattle are chiefly attended to, but there is little or no feed-
ing to fat. The fences are all made of stone, and dikers and road-
makers are numerous. The farm-houses have been generally re-
newed of late years, and chiefly slated. The climate is salubrious
and snow soon disappears from the hills.
	Fuel.--There are no coal works, nor bas coal been discovered
in the parish. It is carted from the Dalmellington coal pits, from
fifteen to twenty miles distant. Peat is a common article of fuel in
the parish, but the mosses of the best quality are nearly exhausted.
	                       V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The stipend is fifteen Chalders, meal and
barley in equal halves, L-9, 7s. 10d. money out of the teinds of the
parish of Carsphairn, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements.
Extent of the glebe, 13 acres. The manse was rebuilt in 1828,
at the cost of upwards of L. 1000, and in 1831 the church was
also rebuilt, at an expense of about 1, 1400 Sterling. Six hun-
dred of the population are attached to the Establisbed Church,
and about 110 to the Dissenters.
	The Rev. Alexander M'Gowan was minister of the parish for
the period of 43 years, and died at the age of 81 in 1826. He
