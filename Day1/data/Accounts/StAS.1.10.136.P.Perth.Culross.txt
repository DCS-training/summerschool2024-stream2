Valleyfield, the farthest east, belonging to Sir Charles Pres-
ton, is a modern, elegant, and commodious house.  Next to
that, on the west, is the Abbey of Culross, (so called from
being situated in the neighbourhood of the old abbey or
monastery), built by Edward Lord Bruce of Kinloss.  It has
a magnificent front to the south, and a turret on each end,
which, with the hanging gardens declining towards the
Forth, give it a very noble appearance.  The house, and
grounds adjacent, came by marriage into the possession of the
family of Dundonald, whose seat it now is.  Adjacent to the
Abbey is the church, and, immediately below this last,
stands the town of Culross, one street of which is built upon

sea; the rest runs along the shore, at right angles therewith.
Almost every house has a garden with fruit-trees belonging
to it.  The town altogether, especially in the approach from
the harbour, has a very picturesque and magnificent appear-

year 1588, having its charter from James VI. in the 22 d of
his reign, and in conjunction with Stirling, Dunsermline,
Innerkeithing, and South Queensferry, sends a representa-
tive to Parliament.  The shore opposite to the town, being
flat, with sunk rocks interspersed, to a considerable depth,
renders the access for ships of burthen incommodious.; not-
withstanding of which, however, when the great coalwork
flourished here under Sir George Bruce, a very considerable
trade was carried on, and different articles of foreign luxury
distributed from this to the neighbouring towns, even as far
as Perth.  At present, there is no foreign trade directly from
the place; but there is a regular ferry every day to Borrow-
stounness, from which all the different articles of merchan-
dize, are conveyed here at an easy expence.  The spring-
tides rise here from 15 to 16 feet.  Further west, and upon
