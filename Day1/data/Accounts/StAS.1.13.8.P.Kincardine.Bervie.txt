     Statistical Account

siness seems to be much on the decline on this coast, owing
to the great scarcity of fishes, particularly of the species
called haddocks.  Within these 10 or 12 years, the had-
docks have left this coast almost entirely.  In the year 
1782, a prodigious storm happened on this coast, the wind 
blowing with uncommon violence, raised the sea in such
mountainous billows, as to produce effects almost like an 
earthquake; and since that storm, the haddocks have every 
year become scarcer.  The ground on which the haddocks
were found, was a continued bed of mussels, (the favourite
food of that fish), clusters of which the fishermen use to draw
up frequently with their lines; but since that storm, the 
bottom has been entirely covered with sand.  The mus-
sels being destroyed in this manner, of course it behoved 
the haddocks to remove to a more favourable station; how-
ever, a few cod-fish are still caught, and sell at a very
extravagant price, at least five or six times the price they 
were formely sold for*.  Of late years, a good many her-
rings have been taken in the proper season, both by the 
fishermen of Gourdon, and the salmon-fishers of Bervie,
which they sell in the neighbourhood at the rate 3 d. a-
dozen.  Crabs and lobsters are also taken on the coast,
and among the rocks.

   Country part of the Parish.-There are about 780 acres
of arable land here, as much more waste and uncultivated 
moor, and a few acres of pasture.  The low lands are a 
fine loam of considerable depth, and the high grounds a
mixture of clay and gravel.  According to the best cal-

*Dr Blagden ascribes the scarcity of haddocks to the effects of elec-
tricity.  If lightening had destroyed the haddocks, it is wonderful how 
it should have spared cod-fish, which have been caught in greater abun-
dance since the year 1782 than formerly.
