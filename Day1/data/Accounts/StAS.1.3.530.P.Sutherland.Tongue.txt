     Statistical Account

   General Character.-The people of this country do not eat
their morsel alone.  They open their hospitable door to the 
traveller; they make the heart of the widow to rejoice; and 
they grant to the poor his desire.  Generosity, indeed, is the
principal trait of their character; to this they add devotion
to the Supreme Being.  An illiterate countryman, while he
contemplates the stupendous scenery of rocks piled one upon
another, the long extended heath, the tempestuous ocean,
and the like, will exclaim, with an expression of countenance
not to be described, 'Justly is HE called Wonderful!'  They
are also fast emerging from their former habits of indolence.
Many of them having been in the south country, in their 
younger days, employed in hard service, have returned to
their native soil, with more skill to work, and more free of
that Highland pride, which made the antient inhabitants of
the mountain disdain to submit to hard labour, or pursue
any othe exercise but the chace, or a military life.

   Advantage of long Leases.-Nothing, indeed, now is want-
ing to make them as industrious as the Lowlanders, but the
introduction of commerce, manufactures, and long leases to
the farmers.  By the want of long leases, they are discou-
raged from improving their farms, and building comfortable
houses on them.  The dread of being removed, when an 
avaricious neighbour offers an augmentation, and an unfeel-
ing master accepts the bribe of iniquity, ties down the hand
of industry, and prevents its operation from extending any
further than to labour the antient fields, and patch up the old
cattage.  There are two respectable farmers in this parish,
who have obtained tolerable long leases some years ago; in
consequence of which they have buily very commodious houses,
inclosed considerable parts of their farms, and are employing
every possible method to meliorate every pendicle belonging
