     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF KILMADOCK OR DOUNE,

     (COUNTY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING,
     PRESBYTERY OF DUNBLANE).

     By MR ALEXANDER MACGIBBON.

     Origin of the Names.

   THE ancient name of this parish is Kilmadock.  The
word kil, is the same with the Gaelic word cill, (the
consonant e, in the Gaelic, being sounded hard, like k in
English), signifying a church-yard.  Some make this word
to signify a burying-place; but the Gaelic word for this is
cladh.  The word cill, is, perhaps, the original of the Eng-
lish word cell, which signifies the cave, or little habitation of
a religious person.
   But, whatever may be the true etymology, it is evident,
that the sequestered spot known by the name Kilmadock,
had been once the solitary habitation of Saint Madock,
(Saint Madocus), and, perhaps, was the place of his inter-
ment, as these pious fathers were commonly buried near to
their reclusive habitation.
