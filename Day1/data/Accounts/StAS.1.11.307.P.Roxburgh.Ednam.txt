     of Edenham.

   Eminent Men.-Mr. JAMES THOMPSON, the celebrated author
of the Seasons, &c. was the son of the reverend Mr. Thomas
Thomson, the second minister of this parish after the Revolu-
tion, and was born at Edenham in the year 1700.  It is un-
necessary here to enlarge upon the merits of an author so well
known, and whose genius and abilities do so much honour to
his native country.  A proposal was made, some years ago,
to erect a monument to his memory, on Edenham Hill, with-
in view of the manse; but the plan has not yet been accom-
plished.  Several noblemen and gentlemen, however, with a
laudable zeal for the literary fame of their country, have met
annually at Edenham, for some years past, to celebrate Thom-
son's birth day, as well as with a view to forward the execu-
tion of that design.

   Antiquities.-There is a small rising ground, W. from the
village, called the Picts Know; out of which, some years ago,
were dug three stone coffins, with an urn in one of them.  The
Know is since inclosed, and planted with trees*.

*A farm in this parish is named Comb-slat, which seems to be so called from its
containing extensive earthen mounds, called Comb-knows.  As, before the union of
the kingdoms, this was the warlike part of the country, these tumuli seem to
have been raised by art, as means of defence.
