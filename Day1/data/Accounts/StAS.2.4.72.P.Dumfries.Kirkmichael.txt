to be owing to the division and cultivation of a very large common,
and the improvement of other lands. In 1801, the population was
reduced to 904. The decrease was probably occasioned by a prac-
tice, then becoming prevalent, of leading farms, as it was called;
that is, a farmer having one farm, possessed, at the same time, an-
other, which was said to be led along with it. By this means, se-
veral farms, formerly having numerous families residing on them,
were, when thus led along with others, left almost uninhabited.
At each census, since that period, there has been a gradual increase,
which would perhaps have been much greater, had it not been for
the change which has taken place by the enlargement of many of
the farms. In 1831 the population was 1226.

	Agriculture and Rural Economy--The whole of the parish has
been surveyed, and plans made of the several farms, at different
times, and by different land-measurers. The number of acres
standard and imperial measure is as follows.

<TABLE>

Meadow and arable land,							6700 Acres.
Sheep pasture,								9190
Mossy pasture interspersed through the arable lands, partly convertible
	into meadow, and including the mosses from which the inhabitants
	are supplied with peat,					 	 550
Sand-bed pasture, comprehending roads, lakes, and water-courses, 	 280
Under wood, natural or planted,						 350
                                                                              -----                                                                           17070

	Probably 300 or 400 acres of this hill land might be advanta-
geously broken up, fallowed, and thereafter sown down with grass
seeds, to improve the pasture.
