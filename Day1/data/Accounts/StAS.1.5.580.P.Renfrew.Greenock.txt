     Statistical Account

In the neighbouring bays and lochs, excellent salmon are
caught in their season, but none for exportation.   God,
haddocks and whitings, are got in great plenty from the rock
of Ailsa upward, with which, besides Greenock and Port-
Glasgow, are supplied Glasgow, Paisley, and the adja-
cent country.

     The Whale Fisbery from Clyde has been by no means
successful.  It was first attempted in the year 1752, when
some adventurers sent several ships to Greenland; but not
finding their account in it, they soon gave it up.  This
trade was again revived in 1786, at which time five large
ships, three from Greenock and two from Port-Glasgow,
well equipped, and commanded by men of experience in
the business, failed of this trade, which, however, is still car-
ried on by the people of Port-Glasgow.  Notwithstanding
the high bounty paid by Government, it is said to be put a
poor concern.
   The Newfoundland and Nova Scotia fisheries are carried
on to a very considerable extent, by some of the Greenock
merchants.

   Manufacturers.-As to manufactures, it is to be observed,
that sea port towns are by no means favourable to them.
The boys generally prefer, (which, indeed, is fortunate,) a
seafaring to a sedentary way of life.  In the year 1725,
a ropework, and some time afterwards, a duck manufacture
were established.  There are now several of them on the
river, when large quantities of cordage and sailcloth are
made, for home consumption and for exportation.  In Gree-
nock there are three soap and candle works, one saddle and
shoe manufactory, and two sugar-houses, all carried on for
exportation to a great extent.
