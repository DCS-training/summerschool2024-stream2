     Statistical Account

   Character, Manners, and Customs.-The character of the
inhabitants of the parish is sobriery.  They prosess to fear God,
and honour the king.  In their deportment they are grave, and
in their speech considerate.  They are remarkably attached to
the institutions of religion, and all of them, (22 persons ex-
cepted), worship together at the parish church.  During the
late attempts of designing men to throw the country into
confusion, not an individual in this parish joined the clubs
of pretended reformers, or shewed the least disaffection to
our happy constitution.  The only reform they wish, is in
their own persons and families, where they acknowledge there
are many things which need to be corrected; but they leave
affairs of state to those who are lawfully appointed to govern.
There has been no one here charged with any capital crime,
for a long course of years.  The minister's garden is situated
near the high road, and might be easily plundered, and yet
he cannot say that he has been robbed of a single apple, since
he came to the parish, upwards of 7 years ago.  There is
very seldom occasion for church discipline; no cause has
been carried from the session to the presbytery for many
years.
   The sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed twice in
every year.  And as there is no stated allowance to defray
the expence of the communion in winter, the parishioners
chearfully contribute for this purpose.
   Young and old are distinguished for polite attention to
strangers.  Men of superior rank have a respectful bow
from every one they meet; for people here have not
been taught the new doctrine of liberty and equality.
   It is seldom there are social meetings.  Marriages, bap-
tisms, funerals, and the conclusion of the harvest, are al-
most the only occassions of feasting.  At these times, there
is much unnecessary expence.  Marriages usually happen
