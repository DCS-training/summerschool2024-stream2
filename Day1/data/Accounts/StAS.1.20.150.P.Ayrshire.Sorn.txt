spreads lime upon the beds.  In spring he sows them with
oats, and then applies the harrow, if the ground will admit
of it; but if it will not, he, with a shovel, throws a cover-
ing of loose earth upon it from the bottom of the trenches.
By means of this process, the first year yields a crop of
about 4 bolls per acre, and the second a crop of about 6.
The same kind of soil, under similar management, like-
wise produces excellent crops of potatoes.  Other persons
have already begun to follow the example of this worthy
and industrious improver; and we may now, therefore, in-
dulge the pleasing prospect, that the moss grounds, which
abound so much in this parish, and which have hitherto been
of very little use, may be gradually converted into good
corn fields, and excellent pastures.

   Stocks and Produce.-The upper or moorland part of the
parish, consists of several store farms, which, altogether,
maintain about 5000 sheep.  In the breed of these sheep
there is nothing remarkable; they are of the common
black-faced kind, and of a size somewhat larger than those
in the southern districts of this county.  In the enclosed
farms, sheep are strictly prohibited, in order to preserve the
young plantations and hedges.
   From the jealousy and reluctance which most of the te-
nants discovered to give an accurate account of their stock,
I am unable to ascertain the precise number either of horses
or black-cattle; but, from the best information which I
could procure, I have reason to conclude, that the number
of the former amounts to about 240, and of the latter to
about 1470.  Some of the horses are still of the old dimi-
nutive breed of the country; but the greatest part of them
are an improved breed, of a middle size, hardy, and well
adapted to the purposes of agriculture.  The farmers rear
most of their own horses, and a few likewise for sale.  The
