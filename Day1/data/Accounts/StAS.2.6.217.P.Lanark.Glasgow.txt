	House of Refuge.--During the last thirty years, several attempts
have been made in this city to reclaim vagrant boys, but hitherto
without effect. This arose chiefly from the youths being already
confirmed in evil habits, and from the want of an asylum and rigid
superintendence. To abate this moral pestilence, a subscription
has lately been entered into, which now exceeds L. 10,500, for the
erection of a permanent House of Refuge in this city. Four acres
of the lands of White-hill have been purchased, and a plan by Mr
John Bryce, architect, combining all the recent improvements, has
been adopted. To those who, like us, have long witnessed the de-
pravity of a class of society to be found in all large manufacturing
communities, this announcement must give great satisfaction, and to
none more than to the Right Honourable the Lord Justice-Clerk,
(Boyle,) who so often from the Bench in lamenting the number
and depravity of young thieves, recommended a house of refuge.
	The number of orphans, and, what is even worse, the number
of children of depraved parents, thrown on the public without any
one to take care of them, almost exceeds belief. A great propor-
tion of these children are brought up in ignorance, in idleness, and
vice, without the fear of God, and very little of man. To prevent
those evils in the very young, and to mitigate those in more ad-
vanced years, is the benevolent object of the managers of this in-
stitution.
