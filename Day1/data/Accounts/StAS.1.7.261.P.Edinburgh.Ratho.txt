   Soil and Culture.-The soil of the land is generally a light
loam, with a considerable mixture of sand in many places.
In some parts, particularly towards the east, it is of a stronger
quality, and tends to clay, a soil in which wheat and beans
are produced to great advantage.  The husbandry of this pa-
rish has been, for several years past, in a progressive state of
improvement.  Considerable quantities of manure, brought
regularly from Edinburgh, and abundance of lime in the
near neighbourhood, have contributed much to produce this
happy effect.  Several gentlemen in the parish farm on a
large scale, and with great spirit and success.  Their ge-
neral practice is, to summer fallow a large field, to manure
it richly, and sow it with wheat, by which they have of pro-
duct generally from 9 to 12 bolls on the acre.  Their subse-
quent crop is commonly beans and pease; after which they
take a crop of barley or oats, with which they sow grass
seeds; they then take one or two crops of hay, and after-
wards keep it some years in pasture.  By this rotation, they
preserve their ground in excellent order.  The following is
given, as one instance out of many, of the fertility of there
lands.  Mr Kirkland, two years ago, summer fallowed and
manured a field of 16 acres; it produced, of good grain, 14
bolls per acre.  The price of wheat was so high that year, as
to sell from 26 s. to 28 s. per boll; so that, from his wheat
and the straw, he realized 20 L.  Sterling per acre, i. e. 320 L.
on the 16 acres.  This fact may be depended upon, as the
writer hereof had it from himself.  Other instances of great
improvement in husbandry, and corresponding produce,
might be mentioned; but this is by no means the general
condition of the parish.  Many of the smaller tenants conti-
nue in the old tract, and thereby retard the progress of im-
provement.
