so that more houses are gone to ruin, for want of inhabi-
tants, than have been built and rebuilt.-The present cu-
stom of employing hired servants, who live in the family,
instead of cottagers, has its advantages and disadvantages.
The advantages seem to be these: 1st, They are more un-
der the master's eye, and more under his command day and
night, than the cottagers, who often live at a distance, and
think themselves obliged to work only stated hours: 2dly,
An industrious tenant can often make more of the benefit
commonly given to cottagers, especially when given in land,
or in grass to cows and sheep, which was formerly the case,
than will pay the wages of a hired servant-The disadvan-
tages seem to be, 1st, The decrease of population; for ex-
ample, there is 1 tenant in this parish the rents L. 300 a-
year, and possesses 5 different farms, in which, about 10
years ago, were 7 tenants and 7 cottagers, which make 14
families; but now there are only 10 families in these farms,
which is a decrease of 4 families, calculating these at 4 1/3,
which I find is the calculation nearest to the truth, in the
country part of this parish, is 17 persons fewer than for-
merly.  2dly, The increase of the price of labour.  Cot-
tagers were formerly nurseries for breeding up servants, and
furnished numbers sufficient for supplying the wants of the
parish, and so kept down the price of labour; but now the
disuse of them lessens the number of labouring servants,
the wages of whom rise or fall in proportion to their num-
bers; and being scare for want of proper nurseries for
them, the price of labour is greatly increased, and must in-
crease, as the spirit of industry increases, and hands are
wanted; so that the disuse of cottagers is, amongst many
others, one great cause of the increase of the price of la-
bour.  3dly, This disuse, and the high rent of small
possessions, discourage matrimony in young people who
are servants.-New Galloway is a royal burgh.  It has
