vestige can now be seen.-The other supposed antiquity
is a Roman,camp; which is said to give name to a place near
it, called Chestus.  There are, it is true, some very visible
marks of this ancient entrenchment; but instead of being
what it is vulgarly believed, to be, it appears, on a proper
view of circumstances to be in reality no more than a home-

the great quantity of coals formerly raised in our immediate
neighbourhood, the spirit of monopoly has for many years
past deprived us of this bounty of Providence; and it is hard
to say how long the same spirit may continue to affect the
poor of this parish; the principal proprietor of the coal-mines
here having entered into an agreement with the proprietor of
an adjoining colliery, to keep his own coal-works shut till
those of the other shall be completely exhausted; in return
for which the other has bound himself, and his heirs, ect. to
pay him an annuity of 20 L. a-year!  Thus the poor of this
