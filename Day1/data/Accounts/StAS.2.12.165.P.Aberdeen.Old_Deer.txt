                   MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   Upon the whole, we conceive, that within the last forty years,
great improvements have been made upon the value, comfort, and
aspect of the country.  In course of that period, the two great
lines of communication by turnpike roads have been opened up,
several other useful roads have been formed anew or greatly re-
paired,-much barren land has been brought into cultivation,-a
greatly improved system of husbandry introduced,-mill-multures
with thirlage to mills abolished,-more attention paid to the selec-
tion and breeding of live-stock,-leases of moderate duration sub-
stituted for liferent tenures,-a greater facility of market provided
for farm produce,-and a more liberal allowance granted by pro-
prietors generally to their tenants for houses, fences, and drainage,
-while they themselves, in consequence of improvements made by
themselves or their tenantry, the changed value of money, and an ex-
cessive competition for tenements, when encouragement or opportu-
nity is afforded for it,-have had their rent-rolls greatly increased.
The actual state of the different properties in the parish in this re-
spect, at present, has not been ascertained; but, reasoning from known
facts, there can be little doubt that, if the ground in the natural oc-
cupation of the heritors were fairly let, the gross rental would exceed
by about a half in sterling money, the old Scotch valuation of
L.7127, 16s. 8d.  Nor is there a less marked alteration in the
dress, diet, furniture, and manners of almost every class of the
people.  Whether the real piety, virtue, and happiness of the com-
munity have progressed in the same ratio, may well be questioned.
