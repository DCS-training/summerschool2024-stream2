     of Kirkbean.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-From the natural situa-
tion of the parish-the extent of sea coast, upon which there
is plenty of sleach and some sea weed, with the bays and har-
bours formerly mentioned, it must possess many advantages.
No farmer in the parish is above two miles distant from the
harbour, where he can ship the produce of his farm, and re-
ceive the highest prices given in the country.  The want of
fuel is the only disadvantage under which this parish labours.
Coal brought from Cumberland, in the north of England, is
the common fuel, which, to the farmer, and more particularly
to the labourer and the indigent, is a very grievous expence.
This, however, in some measure has been lessened, by the
the late repeal of the duty upon coal carried coast-ways, for
which this parish, in particular, is much indebted to the
the right honourable HENRY DUNDAS.

   Character of the Inhabitants.-A considerable number of
the inhabitants of different ranks and conditions of life, are
industrious, sober, active, and charitable.  In their religious
sentiments, they are rational and liberal, and, in their political
opinions, they are manly and loyal.  As a proof of their
loyalty to his Majesty, and their attachment to the present
form of government, they have already subscribed 10 L. to
be applied in furnishing with shoes, made in the parish, their
brave and gallant countrymen now on the continent, "sup-
"porting order, regular government, true liberty and reli-
"gion."  It is expected that a very liberal subscription will
soon appear.
