an increase of them would prove a real nuisance, and con-
tribute materially to corrupt the morals of the people.
   The only language here is Scotch; but the pronouncia-
tion is gradually approaching nearer to the English*.
Gaelic is not spoken nearer than 20 miles; and very few
of the names of places here seem derived from it.
   There are no bridges in this parish, excepting a small
one of 3 arches on the outlet from the loch of Spynie;
nor is there any on the river Lossie below Elgin, though
much wanted.  The roads here are all made by the sta-
tute-labour; and though better than they were formerly,
are still far from what they ought to be:  And this is the
more inexcusable, as they are more easily made here than
in most counties in Scotland.  On the highland road to 
Edinburgh, a traveller meets with no turnpikes or tolls till
he arrives at Perth.
   I have often thought, that the destruction of grain by
pigeons was much greater than commonly supposed.
There are 4 pigeon-houses here; each of which, at a mo-
derate computation, consumes 20 bolls of corn annually.
