port, and far their widows and orphans, and for the relief of ship-
wrecked seamen, has existed in this parish from a period prior to
1591.  Officers and men, in vessels belonging to the port long
paid a per centage of their wages iinto this society.  These con-
tributions are no longer paid.  A proposal was made a few years
ago to dissolve the society, and divide the funds among the exist-
ing members.  This was prevented by interdict, and the Court of
Session ultimately found, that the society cannot be dissolved, and
that the whole property of the society is held in trust for the so-
ciety called the " Prime Gilt Box of Kirkealdy."  The value of
the property belonging to this society, the income of which will in
future be applied in relieving poor seamen, their widows, and or-
phans, is from L.2000 to L.3000.
   The half of the interest of L.780, mortified by Mr John Thom-
son, (the other half being for educational purposes), is applied
" towards the support of respectable inhabitants of Kirkcaldy who
have seen better days."
   Saving's Bank.-A branch of the National Security Savings'

   Poor and Parochial Funds.-No legal assessment has yet been
imposed in this parish.  The poor are maintained from the collec-
tions at the church door and subscriptions among the inhabitants.
The amount of annual church collections is about L.200; L.33
have hitherto been got from seat-rents ; and the additional sum
required has been furnished by subscription.  A sum upwards of
L.400 is annually required to maintain the poor.  The average
number of paupers on the roll for a few years past is 110.
   Besides the provision made for paupers by the kirk-session,
much is done in the town for tbe relief of the destitute, by a La-
dies' Bepevolent Society, 4 Clothing Society, and a fund annuel-
ly raised to supply the poor with coals.  In very few parishes are
   FIFE.                                          3 c
