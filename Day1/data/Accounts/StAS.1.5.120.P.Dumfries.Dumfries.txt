   Situation of Dumfries.-The town of Dumfries is situ-
ated in 55 degree 8' 30" of northern latitude; and, as nearly as
has been ascertained, 4 degree  25' 15" from Greenwich.  It stands
upon the banks of the river Nith, about 9 miles above
where the river discharges itself into the Solway frith.  It
is the capital of the shire distinguished by its name, and the
seat of a presbytery and of a synod.

   Antient State.-Of the precise period, at which it was
founded, no record has been preserved.  The Selgovae, who
seem to have been a tribe of the Cumbri, the most ancient
inhabitants of the Southern parts of Britain, were found by
the Romans in the tract of country, comprehended in the

bounded by the two walls between Solway and Tyne, and
between Forth and Clyde, extended over Dumfries-shire
and Galloway, with the other intermediate counties be-

ed Britain, a new kingdom, founded by Ida and the Angles,
in 1547, spread its authoity from North Cumberland, over
the southern and western parts of Valentia.  The Picts pe-
netrating to the N. and N. E. dismembered Galloway and
Dumfries-shire from the Northumbrian monarchy, and es-
tablished themselves in these districts, in the end of the 8th
century.

   But, although the situation of the town of Dumfries be
nearly at the most southern part, where the Nith has ever
been fordable, and consequently at the very place where, it
is likely, that this river would be passed most generally, in
travelling between the north of England and the western
parts of Scotland; yet the authors, who have commemo-
rated the above particulars, concerning the ancient inhabi-
