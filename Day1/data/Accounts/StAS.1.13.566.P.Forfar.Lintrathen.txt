     Statistical Account

few.  Destitute of the elegancies, and most of the conve-
niencies of life, their desires are limited.  They enjoy little,
and with that little are contented.  Attached to their naked
soil, they are temperate and sober.

   Heritors.-The number of heritors is five, none of whom
resides in the parish.  The valued rent of the most conside-
rable propietor is L. 1074 Scots; of the real rent I have 
not been informed.

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor.-The church is an old,
dark, disproportioned fabrick, built at two different periods.
The manse is a wretched hovel, covered with thatch.  The
abject state of this habitation is not owing to any reluctance
in the heritors to grant repairs, but to another cause, which
has now ceased to operate.  The stipend is L. 400 Scots,
and 40 bolls victual.  The late incumbent, far advanced in 
life when promoted to this charge, officiated 20, and his 
two immediate predecessors 107 years.  Walter Olgilvy,
Esq; of Clova, is patron.-The parochial schoolmaster has a 
salary of fix or seven bolls oats, collected from the tenants,
and some trisling fees.  On this miserable allowance he has
contrived to support a family upwards of sixty years.  The
hut in which he resides is hardly sit to accommodate the
meanest beggar.-The number of poor on the session-roll is
from 5 to 7.  The funds allotted to their relief are the rent
of a gallery in the church, the interest of a small capital,
the mortcloth money, and a weekly collection of 10 d. or 
1 s.  The prices of labour and provisions are the same as
in the neighbouring parishes of Kingoldrum and Glenisla.

   Language.-The names of the parish, and the many places
in it, seem to be partly Gaelic and partly Anglo-Saxon;
but the language spoken by the inhabitants is English, or a
dialect of it peculiar to North Britain.
