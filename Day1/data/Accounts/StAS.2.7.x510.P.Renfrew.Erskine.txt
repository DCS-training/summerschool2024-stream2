most insolent and violent manner, did, at their own hand, and with-
out any order of law, remove and take away Dargavell's seat and
dask in the church whereof he and his predecessors had been in
immemorial possession, as said is, and did sacraligiously remove
and carry away stones that were lying upon the graves of his pre-
deeessors, and did strike and wound severall of his servants.''
The matter was ultimately settled in Dargavel's favour.
  Parochial Registers.--The parish registers extend no farther
back than the year 1703, and they are tolerably well kept, but
those prior to this period are supposed to have been lost through
decay, which is the lore to be regretted, as many curious ex-
tracts might no doubt have been made from them, tending to
throw light on the character of the witches and other suspected,
persons.

Stuart of Minto, who died in the expedition to Darien, about the
year 1669.

Lanarkshire, which was about the year 1580, bestowed "in com-
mendam," by King James VI., upon Walter Stuart, son of Sir
John Stuart of Minto, by Margaret, his wife, daughter of James
Stuart of Cardonal, and was afterwards erected into a temporal
barony.
  This Walter Stuart was, in 1582, appointed one of the Prvy-
Council to King James VL, and keeper of the privy-seal, and
subsequently an extraordinary Lord of Session, and one of the
eight Commissioners of the Treasury and Exchequer, called from
