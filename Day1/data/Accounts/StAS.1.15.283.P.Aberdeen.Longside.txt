suggested the idea of a canal along its banks, from its mouth
near Peterhead, to the village of Old Deer; a distance of a-
bout 10 miles.  The plan might be executed at a very incon-
siderable expence; and would contribute much to the im-
provement of a very valuable district.  It is, in general, a
light soil, easily improved, and lying at the distance of only
from 4 to 9 miles from Peterhead, enjoys almost every ad-
vantage for the exportation of its produce, and the importa-
tion of lime, coals, and other necessary articles.

   The present state of the parish, as well as its susceptibility
of farther improvement, may be inferred from the following
particulars:

*By Dr Webster's Report in 1755, I find that the number of inhabitants
was 1979, or nearly 200 more than the above.  As no satisfactory reason
