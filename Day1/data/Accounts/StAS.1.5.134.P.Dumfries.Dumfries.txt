   Churches, etc.-The town of Dumfries, with the tract
of country parochially connected with it, forms only one
parish.  The whole charge was, for some time after the Re-
formation, under the care of one minister.  After several
successions, Dumfries became, in 1658, for the first time,
a collegiate charge.  Till 1727, both ministers continued to
officiate in St Michael's church.  This had been originally
a Popish chapel, in which religious worship began to be ce-
lebrated, soon after the excommunication and demolition of
the friary; and was kept up, with various reparations and
additions, till 1745, when it was taken down and rebuilt.
In 1717, that which is called the New Church was first
opened.

   The minister of St Michael's, or the Old Church, enjoys a
living, the value of which, including the manse and globe,
may be computed at L. 200 a-year.  The minister of the
New Church has neither manse nor globe; his stipend is
L. 140.  Both are under the patronage of the Crown.
The present minister of the Old Church is Dr Thomas
Mutter, who is married, and has five daughters.  Dr Burn-
side, minister in the New Church, is also married, and has
six daughters and two sons.
