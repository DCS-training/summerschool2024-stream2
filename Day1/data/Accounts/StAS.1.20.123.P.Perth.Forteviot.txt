poorly rewarded.  An application, a few years ago, was
made to the landed interest, by the parochial schoolmasters of
the kingdom, for a small addition to their salaries; but it
was opposed with the utmost vigour, and, in consequence,
did not succeed.  It must, however, be observed, that many of
the landed proprietors in Scotland, impressed with a sense
of the propriety of giving a little mroe encouragement to
a class of men the most useful in society, are spontaneously
offering their assistance in augmenting the salaries of parish
schools.

   Poor.-The poor upon the session-roll are usually about
six or eight; and are supported by the collections at church,
which being only about 3s. 6d. a-week, must afford them
but a very scanty supply.

   Agriculture.-As there is little or no manufacture in the
parish, the people are mostly employed in husbandry, the
mode of which has altered with the late introduction of
agricultural improvements into Perthshire.  Not much of
the parish is inclosed; a circumstance which indicates,
that the farmers of this place have a great deal of pleasure
yet awaiting them, in carrying improvements to a much
greater degree of perfection than they have hitherto reached.

   Antiquities.-This parish affords not a little matter for
the inquiries of the antiquary.  Here, it is laid, was the
residence of some of the kings of the Picts in remote pe-
riods: and here King Kenneth, after the Pictish kingdom
was annihilated, departed this life, as thus narrated in the
MSS. of Melross, and Andreas Vintonius, who wrote in
the time of Robert Duke of Albany.
