     of Kilmadock or Doune.

passes, in an easterly direction, through other two small
lakes, and falls into Loch Ludnich*, a noble lake above
Callander, surrounded with stupendous rocks and moun-
tains, totally inaccessible from the lake on the west side.  The
stream is considerably increased by this lake; and, issuing
from the south-east end of the loch, it dashes over precipi-
ces, rocks, and cataracts, till it reaches the romantic village
of Callander, where it beautifully meanders round the mea-
dows and arbours, as if unwilling to leave this delightful
spot.  Being at length forced to depart, it holds a rapid
course for several miles, washing the ancient chapels of
Torry and Lanerick, the church of Kilmadock, and the
Adelphi cotton-works; and, passing the bridge of Doune,
at length approaches the castle.  From thence it moves
gently along the solitary walks of Blair-Drummond, and
the grotesque pleasure-grounds of Ochtertyre, and joins the
Forth about 3 miles north-west of Stirling.
   The banks of this river were frequently honoured with
the presence of the late Lord Kames, whose profound ge-
nius, and refined taste, has conferred so much honour on
Scotland.  This great admirer of the works of nature, ha-
ving wandered along the banks of this beautiful river, till
he reached that spot below the castle of Doune, where the
scenery is remarkably picturesque; and being wrapt in ad-
miration of the grandeur of the scenery in view, rested him-
self on a seat erected in honour of a favourite friend on
which he immediately placed this incription:

     From Montagu's favourite seat,
       Look up to the lofty sky,
     Look down to the rapid stood below,
              And yield to her,
          That nature is above art.

*Ludnich signifies the little finger, which is the exact shape of the loch.
