improving at the fame time.  Several of there leases are
(1796) unexpired at this day.  In 1767 two estates were
let in this parish for three nineteen years, (57).  They
were at the time prefectly open, uninclosed, and almost un-
cultivated, and the whole buildings upon both of little or
no value.  The tenant built new houses, repaired the old
ones, particularly a mansion-house, on each, inclosed a great
part with substantial stone-dikes, (walls of dry stone about
4 or 5 feet high), and the rest with thorn-hedges, planted
about 60 acres of trees of all sorts, limed and marled and
drained the whole grounds, which were then spouty and
wet, and by that means greatly improved the estates; so
that what was let, in 1767, at L. 152, 10 s. in 1784 was va-
lued at L. 300; and now (1796) they yield a rent of L. 360
per annum and upwards.  But these improvements were
done at a very great expence by a skilful farmer, who ap-
plied the money with judgment.
   Another estate, of about 300 acres, in 1777, brought a
rent of L. 65, which now pays L. 305, besides 75 acres of
very thriving plantations, which were at that time not
worth more than 2 s. per acre on an average.  They were
valued lately by a nurseryman at L. 3375 Sterling.  Their
weedings yield about 10 s. per acre per annum; and if they
continue to thrive equally well, may, when fifty years old,
be worth four times the fum.
   The estate has also been improved at a great expence, by
dressing the fields, inclosing them with good fences, build-
ing mills upon the burn, (a small rivulet), which runs
through the estate, and also farm and cot-houses.
   Another estate in this parish, purchased within these few
years, which was then perfectly open, and in very bad or-
der, is now inclosed, with good stone and thorn fences, well
divided in handsome fields, and about 200 acres planted
with all kinds of trees, which are in a very thriving condi-
