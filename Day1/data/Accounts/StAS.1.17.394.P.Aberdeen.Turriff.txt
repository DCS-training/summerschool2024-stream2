     NUMBER XXVII.

     PARISH OF TURREFF.

     (PRESBYTERY OF TURREFF.-SYNOD AND COUNTY OF
     ABERDEEN.)

     By ALEXANDER SIMPSON.  Schoolmaster, King-Edward,
     Now one of the Ministers of Old Aberdeen.

     Situation.

   AFTER a course of many miles from west to east, the
Doveron, by altering its direction to the north west,
forms an acute angle; and, winding through a beautiful and
fertile vale, continues to slow in that direction, till it falls in-
to the sea at Banff, which is about 10 English miles distant
from this place.  On the south and east sides of this angle,
lies the parish of Turreff, that of Forglen of Old Townan
being contained within it, on the opposite bank of the river.
Near the angular point, where the Burn of Turreff falls in-
to the Doveron, stand the town and kirk of Turreff, from
whence to the extremities of the parish, the distance on all
sides, except westward, is nearly the same, and no where ex-
ceeds 4 1/2 English miles; so that a circle, of which the town
of Turreff is the center, and the radius 4 1/2 miles, will in-
clude both this parish, and a great part of that of Forglen.
The other neighbouring parishes are Alvah, King-Edward,
Monquhiter, Auchterlist, and Inverkeithing.
