either, is the Dovan.  It rises in the parish of Alva, and di-
recting its course eastward, separates the parish of Tillicoul-
try from Blackford; runs through the middle of Glendovan;
is the line of match betweeen Muckart and the northern
branch of Fossaway; touches at the village of the Crook of
Dovan, (so called, because there it turns,) and taking its course
in a south-west direction, again separates Muckart from the
southern branch of Fossaway; passes by Dollar, Tillicoultry,
and Alva; and empties itself into the river Forth, nearly op-
posite to its source, and only about 6 English miles distant
from it.  Taking from its source to the Crook of Dovan, a
straight line, and another straight line to where it falls into
the Forth, they form an angle of about 224 degrees.  It
runs a course, including its windings, of about 40 miles.
   The Dovan affords excellent trout, and the trouts are all
of what are called the burn, or moss kind.  No salmon, or
salmon trout, can pass the Caldron-linn.  There are, how-
ever, some Lochleven trout caught in the Dovan, which are
easily distinguished from the burntrout, being of a quite diffe-
rent kind.  This to a stranger would appear inexplicable, yet
it is easy to account for it A little above the Crook, there is
a small stream of water which falls into the Dovan.  Part of
this stream is carried off to supply the village with water.  What
is taken off runs towards Kinross; and when it is flooded, the
trouts, in the spawning season come up, get into the larger
stream, and from thence into the Dovan, from whence it is
supposed few return.  When the river is greatly slooded, the
trouts are found to fly from the current of the stream, to the
calm and still water at the sides.  Then it is that many people,
with small hand nets, drag the calm pools, and catch them
in prodigious numbers.  This greatly hurts the fishing with
the rod.
