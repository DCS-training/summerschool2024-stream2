L. 5000 in building houses, and that, too, without exacting the usual
per centage from the tenant. The farm-steading then erected on
this valuable property is equal perhaps, both as to accommodation
and appearance, to any yet to be met with in Scotland.

	Fisheries--The Girvan is frequented by salmon, and for a long
period there has been a considerable fishing at the mouth of it,
held, under Crown charters, by the proprietor of the estate of Bar-
gany on the south, and the proprietor of the estate of Dunure
on the north side. In former times, the mode of taking the sal-
mon was by net and coble, but now stake-nets are substituted.
Till very lately, the regular fishers experienced no interference on
the part of the public; but for two or three years past, people
have taken the liberty of putting down, what are called bag-nets
all along the coast, and even on the ground formerly claimed by
the proprietors, and in that way have killed a great many fish.
This inroad is naturally enough opposed by the proprietors, and
the matter is just now before the law courts, but as yet undecided.
	The bay of Girvan seems intended by nature as an excellent
white-fishing station; and experience has proved that most of the
best kinds, such as cod, haddock, whiting, mackerel, sole, floun-
der, turbot, and lobster, are to be found in it. Strange to tell,
however, the taking of these fish has never been prosecuted with
much energy. Nor have the Irish weavers, when unemployed,
and in a state of utter destitution, in consequence of a stagnation
of trade, been at all in the habit of endeavouring to support their
starving families with this easily acquired and excellent food. One
spirited individual in particular, however, namely, Mr William
Johnston, banker, has excited himself much of late, and even sa-
crificed a considerable sum of money, to have the white-fishing
