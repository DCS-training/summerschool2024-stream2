from N. to S. at the greatest breadth, 12 miles.  Its figure
is irregular, perhaps somewhat similar to the cross.  It is
distant from the town of Perth 14 miles, and from the town
of Crieff, 3 miles.  The parish is a mountainous district.  It
lies on the south side of the Grampian hills.  The habitable
part of the parish is divided into the back and the fore part, by
a ridge of very high hills 4 miles in breadth.  Each of these
habitable parts is a narrow valley, enclosed by hills all the
length of the parish, from E. to W.

   Soil, Surface, Cultivation, and Produce, etc.-The soil of
this parish is various, in general it is light, dry and good, but
shallow.  Part of it is gravellish; much of it mossy, and
some of it clay.  By far the greatest part of the parish con-

but mostly covered with heath, and the interjacent flats are
covered with bent, and rather swampy.  On the whole, not
above a third part of the parish is arable:  In the lower part
of the parish, they are introducing the English ploughs,
drawn with two horses, and the man who holds also drives
it.  In the more steep ground, they use the Scotch plough,
drawn by 4 horses, all a-breast, because they think it answers
better for going up hills.  About the middle or end of the
month of March, they sow oats and pease, then their flax; after
which they set potatoes; and last of all they sow their barley.
The earliest barley is ripe about the middle of August; the
harvest becomes general in September, and is finished about
the end of that month.

   Climate, Diseases, and Longevity.-The climate of this pa-
rish is good but various.  Mild, gentle and dry in the vales,
while the hills are hid in fog, or covered with snow, or wash-
ed with rains.  A very common disorder here, is the chronic
