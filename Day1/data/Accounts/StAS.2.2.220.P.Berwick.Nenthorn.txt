more than four feet high. Drains leading to the fence-ditch are
rapidly spreading in every direction where they are needed, and
promise to add greatly to the value of the soil. These are cut
three feet deep, filled two-thirds with broken stones, and cost a
shilling per rood.
   Progress of Improvement.-Forty years ago the rental was just
a half of what it is at present. Considerable tracts of ground, which
were then unenclosed and disfigured with furze and heath, are now
under the ordinary routine of crop-bearing with the rest of the
lands. An aged person, who lived in the parish as a farm-servant
seventy-two years since, informs the writer of this account that there
was then scarcely a fence to be seen. On an eligible spot sheep
were penned for a sufficient time to prepare the ground for crop,
when it was torn up by a ponderous plough drawn by four horses
and as many oxen, yoked two and two a-breast. Grey oats were
sown on the same place two or three years successively; then pease
and beans, or barley; after which, it was left a prey to weeds, or
lay naked and barren, till restored in some measure by the lapse
of time. There was no such thing as a turnip or potatoe heard of
except in gardens. A considerable part of the Nenthorn estate
was let at 2s. 6d. per acre. Men-servant's wages were L. 2, 1Os.
the half year; women's, L. 1. Day-labourers got 6d. to 8d. per
day. A good horse brought a price of L. 5 or L. 6; a cow, L. 5.
Good rough sheep were worth 10s. 7s. and 5s. each.

   Live-Stock.-At Martinmas, the cattle of one year old and up-
wards may be reckoned at 260, chiefly the short-horned breed.
At Whitsunday there are about 2000 sheep and lambs, chiefly of
the Leicester breed. Besides these, 60 scores of sheep, or there-
by, are fed on turnips for a month or two in winter at 4d. per head
per week, or L. 4 per acre. A cow's pasturage for the summer is
L. 5, and a sheep's for the year 7s. There are 110 horses of all
descriptions; and, upon an average, 220 pigs, half and full-grown,
