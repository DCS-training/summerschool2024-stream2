   Miscellaneous Observations.-Thirty years ago very little
white cats were sown in those parishes.  Only small black
oats were thrown into the ground, of which above a firlot
went to make a stone dark and weak meal.  In the higher
lands, three bolls of those small black oats rendered only a
 boll of meal 8 stone weight.  At present very little of those
small black oats are used, and only in high grounds, as being
least liable to be shaken by the wind, and better suited to the
feeding of out lying cattle.  Within these few years, some
improvement has been made in the mode and implements of
husbandry.  The English plough with two horses and with-
out a driver is generally used; and most farmers keep a cart.
Of late, some of the low arable farms have been divided into
three or four small farms, and inclosed, which promises to
turn out to the advantage of both landlord and tenant, as
thereby a spirit of industry and emulation is awakened and
kept up, the land better manured and cultivated; rye, grass,
and clover raised, and more oats, bear, and potatoes, procur-
ed in proportion to the sowing than heretofore.  These are
the natural consequences of the tenants having liberty to act
freely, and unshackled by the will and opinions of three or
four neighbours.  This plan has also been followed by a neces-
sary reduction in the number of cows and horses, by which
means those kept are better reared and fed.
   It was a prevailing error of old, still not quite worn out, in
the management of pasture land, to put in too many cattle, and
in agriculture to plough much without manuring properly.
Out-field land, as formerly manured in this country by sum-
mer folding, or teathing, will not pay the cost of seed and
labour, not to mention the great hurt done to the cattle.  A
few acres, well manured and cultivated, will yield a greater
and better return than double the number of acres poorly
manured and cultivated, and the pasturage will be consider-
