three, and these all connected with shops where spirituous liquors
are retailed.
   Fuel.-Peat and turf, of which there is an abundant supply from
the mosses in the parish, are the chief materials used for fuel.  The
better conditioned classes mix coals with the peat, which makes a
more lasting and pleasant fire.  A load of peats costs Is. 6d
Coals are procured from Peterhead, at the average price of 1s. 3d.
per barrel of 1 1/2 cwt.  Most of the tenants, instead of employing
their own servants, as formerly, to dig and prepare their peats, em-
ploy a peat-caster, who digs, sets, and dries them at the price al-
ready stated per leat.

                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

there are 95 tinder L. 10 of rent; 56 under L. 20; 25 under
L. 50; 12 under L. 100; 7 under L. 150 2 under L. 200; 3

   From a register kept by Mr Logan at Lunderton, in this parish,
from 1806 to 1835, it appears that the earliest day when he be-
gan sowing, was 1st March 1832, and the latest, 16th April 1810;
that the earliest day when he ended sowing was 25th March 1822,
and the latest 28th April 1821 and 1828; that the earliest day
when he began reaping was 4th August 1826; the latest from some
of the years not being noted, cannot be accurately ascertained ;
but it is stated in the MS. sent to me, that the harvest of 1812
was the worst in the whole series, and that the finest seed-time
was in 1825, when sowing was begun on the 22d March, and con-
cluded on the Sth April.
   The principal changes which have taken place in the state and
circumstances of the parish since the last Statistical Account was
drawn up, and the means of still farther improvement, have already
been adverted to in the present report.  The fields are better culti-
vated, the stack-yards are more fully stored, the horses and cattle
are of a larger size and finer quality, and kept in better condition
than they were forty years ago, and all the implements of husbandry
are improved in their order, their construction, and their value.
The houses are more commodious and clean, and much better
furnished.  The people are better informed, and every way better
conditioned.  Poverty has increased, but so have the means of
mitigating it, and that, too, in more than an equal ratio.  A farmer
who died about three years ago, and who had brought up fifteen
children, left upwards of L. 5000, wholly amassed by his own in
