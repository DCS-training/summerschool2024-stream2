     of Kenmore.

   State of the Church and School.-The value of the living,
exclusive of the glebe and a small farm annexed to it, which
the incumbent enjoys by the beneficence of the Breadalbane
family, for the rent of 5 s. yearly, is about 75 L.  The church
and manse were rebuilt in the handsomest manner about 35
years ago, and are still in good repair.  The church is ex-
ceedingly neat and plain; it is built in form of a cross, and
is ornamented with a fine tower steeple.  The manse is large,
handsome, and commodious.  It is situated on a rising
ground on the south side of the loch, and commands a
charming prospect.  Beneath is the village, church, bridge,
loch, and the discharge of the river out of it.  Opposite is
Drummond hill, rising almost perpendicular, and reaching
to the height of about 500 feet above the level of the loch.
This beautiful hill begins two miles below Kenmore, and ex-
tends westward 5 miles.  It is covered, from one end to the
other, with oaks, pines, larches, etc. and forms a most de-
lightful and picturesque object.  The prospect to the cast of
the manse comprehends a considerable part of Lord Bread-
albane's pleasure ground, and plantings about Taymouth;
and is terminated by distant hills.  To the west is a view of
the loch for about 5 miles, where it makes a bend to the
south.  Its sides exhibit a pleasing variety of woods and
corn fields.  The view beyond this is terminated by the
lofty hill of Lawers, already mentioned;
   Having made mention of Taymouth, it may perhaps be
expected that I should give a particular account of that place.
This, howevers is task to which I confess myself unequal.

plants.  A non-descript grass, probably of the Poa genus, is
sound growing near the foot of the mountain.  It is a beautiful
grass, and grows to the height of about 4 feet This, with
some of the above mentioned plants, was lately discovered by
Mr John Mackay, an expert botanist, now in Edinburgh.
