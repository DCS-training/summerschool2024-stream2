the Balnagown Highlands, and also the parish of Kincar-
din, cease to march with this parish; and there also Assint
begins to run marches with the barony of Coigach, parish
of Lochbroom, in this manner: From said Cloich-glas-
maul-a-kirn, to the highest eminence of Lead-na-luib-a-
croi*.  But we must not pass on without observing, that from
Ballach Ke-nich, especially from the source of Auldan-na-
kal-gach, the march, with little variation, holds thence a
course from S. E. by S.W. to the above Lead-na-luib-a-croi;

highest part of Maul-an-our+; from that summit by the
south side of Maul-a-vourich++, in the same direction to the
top of the hill, called Ki-uch^^; thence all along as ridges
of hills and water divide, by the highest part of Maul-cor-

earth from Balnagown's property in his shoes, declared solemnly, as he
stood with the inquest at Auldan-na-kal-gach, that he was then standing
on the Thane's undoubted property; then it was that the burn got the
name of Auldan-na-kal-gach.
