     Statistical Account

is pleasant, has a sombre appearance, and instantly fills the
mind of the spectator with the idea of the folly of engaging
deeply in faction, whereby an estate, (of which this is a part),
more valuable and more commodious than any other of the
same size in Scotland, was lost for ever to its owners.  The
young woods on the estate of Fountainhall, it has been ob-
served, have of late suffered much from squirrels, which
were introduced some years ago at Dalkeith, and have spread
to this neighbourhood.  They have attacked the Scotch firs
in the proportion of about 1 in 20, and, almost every larix
and elm.  Already many of each of them are killed.  If the
harm they do in other places be as great, and be progressive
as they multiply, this intended improvement will be unfor-
tunate.

   Population.-From the number of births registered during
the last 10 years, compared with a like period at any time
since 1750, it would appear that the population has been in-
creasing in that degree which might be expected in a district
like this, where the whole inhabitants are not employed in
agriculture.  This may be the more readily admitted as suf-
ficient evidence of the fact, that in the country parishes, ma-
ny of the common people, since the date of the tax upon the
registration of baptisms, do not register the births in their
families; a circumstance to be regretted, as it may, in the
course of events, be attended with bad consequences to their
posterity.  From various enumerations, however, taken at
different periods, it is certain that the increase has been by
no means uniform, as will appear from the following table.
