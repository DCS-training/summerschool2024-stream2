   Poor.-The poor in Penpont are tolerably provided for.
None go about asking alms except 2 lunatics.  The kirk-
session has L. 450 at interest.  The Duke of Queensberry
gives a bounty of upwards of L. 10, and likewise 25 stones
of oat-meal.  The collections are L. 12 per annum.  The
whole annual amount of the contributions for the poor, who
consist of 25 families, and several individuals, is about L. 46.
Their principal food is oat-meal and potatoes.  The articles
of clothing, especially shoes, are far more expensive than
formerly; fuel has also advanced in price.  The rent of
houses is tripled.  When a person stands in need of a
nurse as well as necessaries, a relation commonly takes the
charge, and the session pays at the rate of L. 5 per annum.
A case of this kind seldom happens.  Fourteen shillings are
allowed for the expence of a funeral.  Four-fifths of the pa-
rish, which is mountainous, consists of sheep farms; and the
