   Rivers.-The Heriot rises at the west end of the parish.
Ensum-cleugh in Dewar, Garwell punks, and Blackhope
Scares are the supposed sources.  It flows east, divides the
parish into two, and then loses itself in the water of Gala.
The Gala rises in the east end of the parish, at a place
called Nettleflat Wells, or Whitelaw Well, within the pro-
perty of Mr Borthwick of Crookstoun.  It runs south,
passes Galashiells, and then disembogues itself into the
Tweed.  These rivers abound with trouts, which gentlemen
come from all quarters to fish.  It is much to be regretted,
that the gentlemen in the neighbourhood permit poachers

four will sally out from Edinburgh, Dalkeith, etc. and in
a short space fill their creel or bag, by sweeping every thing
before them.  They exemplify the old proverb, "All is fish
"that comes in the net."  Even the salmon, in close time,
which come up to spawn, do not escape a dreadful mas-
sacre.  During the autumnal months, and after a few
weeks, the water is covered with lights, composed of old
sacks, or rags and tar; and the lister*, as it is commonly
called, is heard plunging in every hole.

   Animals.-The quadrupeds are horses, black cattle,
sheep, hogs, hares, and badgers.  The birds are partridges,
muirfowl, and plovers, etc. besides the common domestic
fowls.

   Soil, Cultivation, and Produce.-The soil in general, ex-
cept in the valleys, is thin and gravelly; it admits of a sti-
mulus, such as lime, and then is not a little productive.
The farmers often say, "they have plenty of growth, if
