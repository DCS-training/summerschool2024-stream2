rity which it promised, than by its pleasantness.  The
castle was built on a precipitous rock, immediately over-
hanging the river.  This rock appears as if insulated by na-
ture.  A stream pours down through a deep chasm on each
side of it.  Thus it scarcely required any artificial means of
defence.  No vestiges of this ancient castle are now dis-
cernible.  A humble cottage occupies its place.  Within
these few years, part of one of the walls of the chapel was
standing.  It was neatly built with hewn stones.  But they
have been lately carried off, and applied some other way.
   A hill, in the neighbourhood of Achlouchrie, receives
the name of the Castlehill.  Like the site of the castle of
Quiech, it overhangs the river, which here runs in a deep
bed, by reason of the high rocks on either side.  A fosse,
still twelve feet deep and thirty wide, forms a semicircle
round this hill.  This, it is supposed, had been dug with a
design to bring in water from the river for depending the
place.  It would seem, however, that there never has been
any building here, as there are no marks of foundations.
   Near the village of Tannadice, there is a place called the
Castle of Barnyards.  According to the tradition of the
country, a gentleman of the name of Lindsay began to erect
a castle here; but having killed the proprietor of Finhaven,
in a quarrel, near this place, was obliged to fly.  Thus, it is
said, the building was never finished.  Within these few
years, several of the vaults were standing; and someof the
walls, from five to seven feet in height.  But the stones
have been employed for building on the farm.  Some cen-
turies ago, great part of this country was in the possession
of the Lindsays, whose chief, the Earl of Crawford, had his
residence at Findhaven, a little way from this, on the other
side of the river.  The Lindsays, formerly of Glenquiech,
pretended to be the proper heirs of the lands of Barnyards.
