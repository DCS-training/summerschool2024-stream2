some part of the year.  This house is yet standing.  The
episcopal arms, and the date of the year in which it was
built (1633), are cut in free stone above the door.
   These parishes were never surveyed with a view to as-
certain the precise number of acres which they contain.
Mr Murdoch Mackenzie principally directed his attention
to the sea coasts, which he has delineated with great exact-
ness.  It may be presumed, however, that his map is as
near the truth, with regard to the real extent of these pa-
rishes, as any idea we can form.  By his map it appears,
that these parishes are 9 English miles long, and from 2 1/2
to 5 1/2 miles broad.  If we fix 3 1/2 miles as the mean breadth,
which cannot be far from the truth, then these parishes
contain 31 1/2 square miles, which, at 640 acres to the square
mile, will be in whole 20,160 English acres.

   Sea Coasts.-The whole west coast of these parishes, ex-
cepting the Sandy Bay in the parish of Sandwick, are bold
and elevated, rising perpendicularly from 100 to 400 or
500 feet in height; which, together with the mountains of
Hoy, make it easy to the mariner to distinguish this coast.
   The mountains of Hoy are seen from Cape Wrath, which
lies distant from Hoy 17 leagues.  Along the west coast of
these parishes, at one league's distance from the shore, there
is 40 or 50 fathoms depth of water.  There are no shoals
in the channel of Hoy Sound, on the side next these pa-
rishes, but two; which may be avoided by keeping two
cable lengths from the shore; one of these shoals is visible
at two hours ebb.  As the coast can be seen at a great di-
stance, and there are no shoals but these two, which are not
dangerous, there are consequently few vessels wrecked on
the sea coasts of these parishes.  The velocity of the spring
tides in Hoy Sound is 7 miles in the hour; that of neap
tides 3 miles.  It is high or flack water in Hoy Sound at
