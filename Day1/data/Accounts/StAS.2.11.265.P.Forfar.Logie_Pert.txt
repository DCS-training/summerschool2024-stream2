   Antiquities.--The only antiquities in the parish are the three
tumuli, on three laws of Craigo, mentioned in the former Statisti-
cal Account, and situated nearly a mile west of the house of Craigo.
Two of these tumuli have been opened, and in one of them was
found a stone coffin, containing a human skeleton almost entire,
--the bones of an extraordinary size, of a deep-yellow colour, and
very brittle. In the other tumulus opened, there were found, about
a foot from the surface, four human skeletons of gigantic propor-
tions, and near to these, a beautiful black ring like ebony, of a fine
polish, and in perfect preservation. The ring was 12 inches in
circumference, and 4 in diameter, flat in the inside, rounded with-
out, and capable of fitting a large wrist. In the same tumulus was
found an urn full of ashes. From the discovery of these skeletons
of extraordinary size, both here and in other parts of Scotland,
some confirmation would seem to be given to the ancient tradition,
that at one time there was a race of giants in this country.
		       III.--POPULATION.
   There is no written record front which the state of the popula-
tion can be exactly ascertained previous to 1791, when the amount
was 999. In 1801 it had decreased about 100, in consequence of
the junction of farms, and the demolition of cottar houses; but
since then it has gradually increased, and in 1831 it was 1360,--
an increase, doubtless, owing principally to the flourishing state of
the two manufacturing establishments in the parish, which of late
years have been greatly enlarged, and in the immediate vicinity of
which, consequently, a great part, we may say about one-half, of
the whole population is congregated.
