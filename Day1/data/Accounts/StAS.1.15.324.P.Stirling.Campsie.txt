among the shepherds, by the name of the earn, a visit of which
amongst the flock is dreaded as much as that of the fox.  But
of all the birds of prey amongst us, the hen-harriers, or white
aboon-glade, as he is called, is the most destructive to game,
both partridges and muirfowl.  They breed on the ground a-
mongst rashes in the muirs, and fly low along the surface of
the earth in search of prey; the corbie or raven, the hooded
or carrion crow, rooks, jackdaws, and the red legged crow, are
natives of this district.  There are about six pairs of ravens,
which breed annually in the rocks, and are exceeding destruc-
tive to young lambs in a bad spring.  I have seen, again and

head, till the poor creature fell headlong over a precipice;
and before the shepherd could climb to the spot, the raven
had picked out its eyes.  The red legged crow is but scarce
with us; we seldom meet with above a pair or two in the
whole range of the Campsie Falls; when we do meet with
them, it is amongst the jackdaws, of which there are a con-
siderable number which haunt our rocks.  A very curious scene
is frequently exhibited in our hills.  If it should happen that
a fox leaves his hole, and basks himself in the sun, among the
rocks, immediately all the birds of prey within a mile of him
will assemble, and flutter, and scream over the spot where the
thief is lurking; eagle and hawk, raven and kite, and jack-
daw forget their: animosities, seemingly combining in a mu-
tual league to disturb the retreat of reynard, so that the hunts-
man considers these birds as infallible guides to his sport.  It
may be observed, that beasts of prey are every day becoming
scarcer.  Till within these two years, we had a regular
bred huntsman, who hunted this district; his salary was paid
by the tenants, at so much per plough, which huntsman and
dogs were kept and fed by each tenant in his turn.  The father
