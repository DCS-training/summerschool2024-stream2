   `I have a great deal more to say on these favourite sub-
jects, but perhaps you will think I have already said too much,
so that I shall only for the present add, that I remain always,
     Reverend dear Sir,
     Your most humble servant,
     D. MORICE.'

     Parish of Alberbrothock.

     Answers by the then minister of Arbroath, to the queries circulated
     by Mr. Maitland, when he was about to publish his History of
     Scotland; communicated by Dr. Lorimer.

   The abbey of Aberbrothock was erected for the entertain-
ment of the Tironensian monks by King William, in honour
of Thomas O'Becket, falsely entitled saint and martyr.  How-
ever, this dedication, it seems, obtained for the inhabitants
of Aberbrothock a grant from John king of England, where-
by they were to enjoy the several privileges of his own subjects
in all parts of England, London excepted.-Pope Benedict
granted the abbot and his successors a right to wear the mi-
tre, rings, robes, and other pontifical ornaments.
   The receipts of this monastery in 1562 were, in money,
2553 L. 14 s.; 30 chaldrons of coals; 3 bolls, 3 firlots, 2 pecks
of wheat; 143 chaldrons, 9 bolls, 2 pecks of bear; 196 chal-
drons, 9 bolls, 2 firlots of meal; 27 chaldrons, 11 bolls of
oats; 3 lasts and 1 barrel of salmon;-the small receipts by
fines, beasts, poultry, etc. being omitted.  The last abbot, be-
ing John Hamilton, second son to the Duke of Chateauherault,
becoming a protestant, he was created Marquis of Hamilton
