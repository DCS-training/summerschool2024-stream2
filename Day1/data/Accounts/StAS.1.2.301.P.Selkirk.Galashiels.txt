marle, but chiefly, because unskilful farmers, after having o-
vercropped one part, by raising oats for many years successive-
ly, are forced to give it rest, and to break up what has long lain
in pasture.  Notwithstanding the wetness of the soil, and cli-
mate, the sheep walks are sufficiently dry, owing to the natu-
ral declivity of the ground, and, in sone places, to drain-
ing.
   On the north of Tweed, the soil, in general, is dry and
shallow, lying partly on gravel, a good deal on till, and some
on rock.  it is remarkably full of small stones, which almost
every where cover the surface.  It has been found, however,
by experience, dangerous to remove them, unless the shallow
soil, is, at the same time, deepened and enriched.  They are
said both to reflect heat, and to retain moisture; and to them
is to be attributted, in some degree, the luxuriance and excel-
lent quality of the crops, in this part of the district; which,
considering the small depth of the soil, are truly astonishing.
Even here, there is a considerable portion inclining towards
clay; some of it is stiff and deep, though, on the whole, not
difficult to work.  In sone hollows, there are swamps, and a 
kind of moss, yielding very bad peat; and all the spots,
where moss appears, is laid together, would fearcely exceed
10 acres.-No marle can be found, by all the trials which
have been made; and, though it may appear incredible, and
cannot easily be accounted for, it is nevertheless confidently
asserted, by some, who have made the search, that there is no
marle in the whole range of country, from Tweed to the vici-
nity of Edinburgh, except in some places of the Merse.
   On the clay soil, and high grounds, both oats and pease are
sown as early, and reaped as late, as on the south of Tweed.
But on the dry soil, which, though shallow, produces the su-
rest and best crops, oats are never sown, excepting in a very
tempting season, till the very end of March, or beginning of
