     Statistical Account

   Among the lower classes dram and tea drinking is too
frequent, and the too general substitution of spirits in place
of malt liquor has a pernicious influence on their health and
morals.
   When I was settled in 1763, there was no post-chaise;
there are at present two in the town, which are sufficient
in winter, but in summer they cannot supply the demand
for chaises from the inhabitants and company who resort
hither.  Thirty years ago, as far as I can recollect, there
was no clothier's shop; the inhabitants in general were sa-
tified with cloth manufactured at home, or goods retailed
here from Glasgow, or commissioning cloth from Aber-
deen.  There are at present three clothiers shops, who
have all kinds of cloth from the different manufacturing
towns in England, besides such goods as are made at Pais-
ley and Glasgow.  There are two shops who sell only goods
from these two manufacturing towns; frequently different
people find it their interest to bring goods from there pla-
ces, and reside in this town till they are sold.

   Hints of Improvement.-In a word, the town of Peter-
head is in a very thriving state, and would be much more
improved if there was a firm and steady police, some nui-
sances removed, greater exertions made to improve the
harbour, soft spring-water brought into the town, which
might be found at no great distance, the streets better pa-
ved, and illuminated with lamps in winter; it would like-
wise contribute much to the ornament of the town, if some
regular plan could be adopted as to the size of the houses
in the new streets that are lately opened.-There is no
greater defect than the want of a proper schoolmistress of
education, manners, and character, to teach the young girls
such branches of education as are only to be found in lar-
ger towns at a very high expence.
