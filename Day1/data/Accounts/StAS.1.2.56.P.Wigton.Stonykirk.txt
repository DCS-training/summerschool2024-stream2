mounds, formed like a sugar loaf.  The most remarkable of
them, near Balgreggan-house, is 460 feet in circumference, at
the base, the perpendicular height 60 feet; and there is a cu-
rious excavation on the top.  It is defended by a large circular
softee. On the lands of Garthland, is a square tower, 45 feet
high, with the date 1274 on the battlements, formerly the re-
sidence of the Thanes of Galloway.  Here are some fine trees, ash,
birch, elm.  A few of the former measure 9 1/2 feet in girth.  The
Bay of Float, in this parish, is so called, from the circumstance
of some vessels of the Spanish Flota being wrecked there; and
at Money-Point, near it, many dollars were found.  On the lands
of Ardwell, are some remains of druid temples, and Pictish
castles.  There is also a chalybeate spring; and a cave, near the
bay of Float, called the Good Wife's Cave, which has a very
remarkable echo.  Two gold lacrymatories, weighing 3 1/2 ounces
each, were found in 1783, on the estate of Garthland.
