     General Appendix to

   Mode of Cultivation.-Oats being our principal crop, we
consume great part of winter and spring in ploughing for
them, and getting them into the soil; beginning ploughing,
with the cleanest land, to prevent it growing into weeds
against the seed-time.  Potatoe and turnip land is cross
ploughed early in winter, to mellow it, for laying up in drills
at the proper season.  Pease are sown hot-fur.  Summer fal-
low is not much tried.  The plough is Scots; drawn by two
horses.  Carts, harrows, and all the implements of husband-
ry, are light.

   Weeds.-Land which has been long in cultivation is very
foul.  Annuals infest it, and destroy the crops; of this kind
are gule, wild-kail, day-nettle, charlock, mugwort.  To de-
stroy these, we lay out the lands.  The annuals disappear
directly after; but thistles, knot and quick grass, and crow-
foot, remain for two or three seasons, and then disappear al-
so.  The lands incline to stock themselves with clovers, dai-
sy, ribwort, and other grasses; and the pasture continues
good for years in rich parts of the land; but on dry hilly
pastures, fog or moss soon encroaches, destroys the grass, and
forces the farmer to break the ground, unless he has the
command of water to scatter over it.  Whins and broom
are also very ordinary intruders in warm dry soil; and
rush, in wet grounds.
   In these remarks, I allude to land, which is left out with-
out a green fallow; for this operation cleans it well, and
the grass seed comes up unmixed.
   It is remarked that green-fallow destroys the gule more
effectually than red-fallow.  We are too indolent in destroy-
ing seeding weeds before they shed; and also in laying up
root weeds to the frost.  It is an ordinary mistake, when
land is laid out in sown grass, to be too sparing of pasture
