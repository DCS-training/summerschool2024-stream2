     Of Monktown and Prestick.

many human bones were found, as probably, the burying-
place was nigh to it.  There is a beautiful prospect from it 
of the country around, and the western sea.  Nigh Prestick, 
upon the toll-road to Ayr, is situated Kincase, or King's Case, 
a charitable institution in the time or Popery*.

*The traditional account is, that King Robert Bruce gave a certain terri-
tory of land for maintaining 5 persons that were afficted with the leprosy,
which was denominated God's loan to Robert, and now Robert's loan, general- 
ly pronounced loans, lying in the parish of Dundonnald, out of which are paid 
64 bolls of meal, and 8 merks Scots, with some threaves of straw for thatch-
ing the hospital, payable out of other lands in the parish of St. Quivox, being 
8 bolls meal, and 1 merk, to each yearly; and is there should be but one, he 
has a right to the whole.  Sir Thomas Wallace of Craugie, and his ancestors 
were in use to present these persons, and cause an inquiry to be made into their 
case before they were received.  As no diseases of that description appear, per-
sons labouring under diseases thought incurable, or in indigent circumstances, 
are admitted to the charity.  The right of presentation was some time ago sold, 
along with the estate of Craigie, by judicial sale, and purchased by the town 
of Ayr.
