   Population.-The return to Dr Webster about 40 or 50
years ago, was 1360.  In the year 1673, the examinable
persons in the parish of Wardlaw, were reckoned by the
then incumbent about six or seven hundred.  If Farnua
bore the same proportion to Wardlaw then as now, both pa-
rishes might contain 850.  About 30 years ago, by a list of
the late incumbent, the examinable persons in the united
parish were about 950.  Every year since 1773, a new list
was made by the present incumbent; the examinable per-
sons were never much above 1000, nor below 950, till 4
years ago, when their number increased.  By an exact sur-
vey made in the  close of the year 1789, the examinable
persons were 1190, of whom there were 489 males, 701 fe-
males, the proportion of males to females being nearly as
5 to 7.  Under 9 years of age, not entered on the list, were
380, making for the number of souls 1571.  The  reasons
for the increase of examinable persons, I take to be these:
First, about 4 years ago, several small farms were thrown
into a few large ones; the greater part of those farmers
who were dispossessed, remained in the parish as cottagers,
while other persons were brought in to manage the large
farms.  Again, several gentlemen in the parish have a taste
for improvements as planting ditching, by which they give
constant employment to a number of labourers, so that per-
sons of that description crowd in from other places.  The ave-
rage of births for the last 7 years is nearly 40, of which there
are 20 males and 20 females.  The males and females are al-
most equally balanced.  The whole nmber of births for the
