since the year 1730.  The newchurch is situated near the
manse, almost equi-distant from the 3 villages, and was built
in 1773.  It is a small neat building, well lighted, but not
very commodiously seated.  There are two church-yards,
one where the old church was situated,^^and the other at the
new church.  The old manse has long been converted into

<FOOTNOTE>

^^Mr Duncan's Lectures on the Epistle to the Hebrews were published after
his death, and are much esteemed for their piety, orthodoxy, and learning.

   ^^The old church and manse were situated near the house of Tillicoul-
try.  The church belonged to the Abbey of Cambuskenneth, having been
granted to it by King MALCOLM, together with the tythes and pertinents.
But after the Reformation, the family of MARR became heritable proprietors
of the church, parsonage, vicarage, and 10 acres of gebe.  And as the abbot
and convent of Cambuskenneth had set the teinds in tack to the CONVILLS of
Culross, the proprietors of Tillicoultry, JOHN Earl of MARR, May 30th 1628,
ratified the tacks, and also the feu charters, and insestment of the glebe; and
granted procuratory for resigning the same into the hands of his Majesty, in
favour of JAMES Lord COLVIL, and his son.
