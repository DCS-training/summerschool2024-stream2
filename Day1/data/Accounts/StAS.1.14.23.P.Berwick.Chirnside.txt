     of Chirnside.

   The statement now to be given of the present popu-
lation of the village and parish of Chirnside, will suffi-
ciently verify what has been asserted of the unquestion-
able effect of the land culture, to advance it in a signal
degree, in any other such country place, which has the
advantage of a natural good soil, and were the land-
lords are not reserved in granting sues, or many years
leases of grounds for houses; although that village were
but indifferenly favoured, by the situation, for the intro-
duction of any very considerable manufacture.  This
consideration deserves more regard than what now ap-

be, what obtained too long in many places of Scotland, an aversion on the
part of the heritors, to grant grounds for houses and areas necessary to
them, either in the mode of tenures, or of long leases, reckoned equi
valent to them.  The objections to these, as either disadvantage-
ous, or inconvenient alienations of their property, were not soon overcome
among the landlords in general.  But offers and solicitations for them be-
coming more frequent, it appears, that, in the year 1767, 9 of them had
been admitted by Mr. Hall, and his predecessor, in the form of long leases;
yet it was not till the year 1770, that a progressive addition, both to the
rented houses of the village, and those in leases, was gradually carried on,
to the 1790, which may be reckoned that of the present establishment of
the village as to the number, and condition of its houses; although, in the
two following years, some new ones were built.  In this manner, while
the principal heritor added to his houses in property, a certain number at
intervals of time, and granted such leases of grounds, as have been men-
tioned, to purchasers, a new town may be said to have been built between
the two, in the course of 21 or 22 years; the former being reckoned to
have erected 20 houses, and the latter 26.  Those of the proprietors build-
ing are, several of them, accommodated to the reception of 2 or 3 families,
and 1 or 2 capable of containing as many more; so that there cannot be now,
as formerly, any computation made of the number of families from that
of the houses.  All the new ones are neatly constructed of free stone, some
of them having 2, and others 3 stories; 3 l or more of them, are covered
with red tiles, and 5 with blue flates; and a few, for which other heri-
tors have afforded ground, have the lately approved covering of the corded
thatch.
