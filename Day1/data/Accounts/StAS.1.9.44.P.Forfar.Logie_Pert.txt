measure been given up; so that there is scarely now 100
sheep in the whole parish, and there are chiefly kept for
the use of the table.  The parish can afford itself a very
tolerable supply of various kinds of provisions.  It does not
export any considerable quantity; but finds in general a rea-
dy market for grain of different kinds at Brechin and Mon-
trose, where it is bought partly for the use of the inha-
bitants, and partly by commission for exportation to other
places.  Both at Brechin and Montrose, but especially the
latter, a good deal of bear and barley is fold for malting.
Till of late years very little ground was sown in artificial
grasses.  It is said the first ever known in the parish was a-
bout the year 1746 or 1747, when a person in the parish
of Pert having sown a ridge with clover, got a public pro-
clamation made for people to keep off their sheep and cat-
tle from it, which brought many to fee it as a matter of
curiosity.  Oats are generally sown about the end of
March, and begin to be reaped about the 1st of September,
and sometimes later.  Barley is sown about the middle of
April, bear later; and both are commonly reaped rather
earLer than oats.  Pease are sown and reaped much about
the same time with oats.  Wheat is sown here in Septem-
ber and October, and reaped about the same time with
barley.  The ripening of the different corn crops is rather
retarded by the liming now so much in use.  Flax is sown
about the end of March, and reaped the 1st of Au-
gust.  Turnips are sown about the middle of June; grass
feeds according to the different crops with which they are
sown out; and hay is usually cut in July.  The gross a-
mount of the parish in Scots acres, with the different ways
in which these at an average are employed, are as follow:
