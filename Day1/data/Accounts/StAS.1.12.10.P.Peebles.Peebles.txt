erected near 200 monumental stones, many of them still stand-
ing, and others fallen down,-indications that in very early 
times, when the Gaelic was the common language of the 
country, and when the Romans had as yet been the only in-
vaders of it, a great battle had been fought on that hill, and 
that at the strong camp on the top of it, numbers had been 
killed, and were buried.  On the extremity of the parish to- 
ward the N. W., is a high hill called Melden, properly Mel-

it, anciently in worship of the Sun, or afterward to give signal

with a ditch above ten feet in depth.  Many other camps are 
to be seen on eminences and on the tops of hills, all over the

of the country, invasion and war were made by the mouth of 
the Tweed on the E. and of the Solway on the W.; yet 
small parties of the army often penetrated for plunder into 
the interior parts.  The predatory disposition, but too much

freebooters made incursions into this part of the country every 
summer, for carrying off, under night, horses, black cattle, 
and sheep.  In defence against these various depredations, 
strong castles were built, by the kings of Scotland, on the 
lower parts of the Tweed, and were continued by the land- 
holders along the higher parts of it, and on the waters which
