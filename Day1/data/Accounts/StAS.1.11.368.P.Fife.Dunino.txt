we shall leave the determination of this controversy, to those
who may think it worth the investigation.  It may not be
amiss to observe, however, that although the people of King's
Muir have, for time immemorial, connected themselves with
the district of Denino, quoad Sacra; yet there is a little farm,
situated between this parish and it, which pays stipend to the
minister of Crail, as he himself says, though perfectly uncon-
nected with King's Muir, and belonging to a different pro-
prietor.  The most fertile parts of King's Muir are parcelled
out into small farms, let by the lump, to persons, most of
whom are either tradesmen, or work, during a great part
of the year, by day-labour.  The population of it is as un-
der:

   Proprietor, Rent, Minerals, Ect.-The estate of King's
Muir is now entailed on the name of Hanno, the surname of
its present laird, whose whole yearly rental amounts to 100 L.
There is nothing remarkable in the King's Muir, besides its
containing the coal-mine above mentioned, and one of the
two mines that convey the water from the links, which was
dug nearly 50 years ago, being more than 300 fathoms in
length;  in most places 9 ditto from the surface of the earth;
originally 18 inches wide, and 3 1/2 feet high.  The coal here
was hitherto wrought by a wind-mill, no vestige of which
remains; but  will in future be wrought by a different ele-
