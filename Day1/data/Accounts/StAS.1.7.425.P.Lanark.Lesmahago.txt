This is sold for about 5 s. per ton, and some of it is carried
to places 40 or 50 miles distant.  Peats, which when dried
are almost as hard as coal, and burn with a strong flame, are
dug in several mosses in this parish.  Beds of iron-stone are
seen in different parts of the parish.  Beds of lime, of a great
thickness and excellent quality, are found very near the sur-
face in many places.  Some of these beds are not less than
30 feet thick; and the quality of the lime so good, that upon
an analysis 29 parts of 30 have been found to be pure calca-
reous earth.  Various petrifactions, such as shells of different
figures, parts of the sculls and horns of sheep, and bits of
sticks, are found in the lime quarries.  In the upper part of
the parish marl has been lately discovered.  In one place
there is a vein of grey marble, blocks of which some old peo-
ple mention to have been carried to Hamilton house and
Douglas house, but it is not known how it proved.  There
is also some appearance of a slate quarry in a moor called
Dunside moor; but as it has not yet been fully explored,
the quality is not ascertained.  Huge masses of granite or
whin rock, form the basis of the mountains on the west side
of the parish.  Amidst this great variety of fossils, free stone
of a good quality for building, is obtained only in a few
places; some of the quarries, however, are of a remarkable good
quality, particularly on the banks of the Nethan, where
large blocks of stone are cut, which are so beautifully vein-
ed, and take so fine a polish, that it gets the name of Craig-
nethan marble, and is much valued for columns and steps of
large stairs.

   Cattle, Cultivation, and Produce.-It has been already ob-
served, that the greatest part of this district, from the inequa-
lity of the surface, the nature of the soil, and the great ele-
vation of the country, is better adapted for pasture than cul-
