elm, beech, alder, birch and elder grow in it; but there
are  no extensive plantations of any of these kinds.  A few
hundred acres have of late been planted with the common
fir.  Besides the domestic animals, the numbers of which
in the district could not be ascertained, as the tenants shew-
ed an aversion to discover their flock, there are plenty of 
hares and patridges; there are the hedge-hod, otter, pole-
cat and fox.  The sheep-farmers used formerly to keep
up their flock by purchasing hogs every year at Linton
market; but they have now begun, and it is believed with
success, to rear their own lambs, and of course they re-
quire a smaller supply from the south country.  Horses
and black cattle are reared on almost every farm of the
parish.  In general, it may be observed, that oats and bar-
ley are the principal productions of the parish.  Every 
farmer sows a proportion of pease and lint-feed, and plants
potatoes; several of them sow turnip, and this crop is be-
coming every year more frequent, because its value is
better known; all of them lay down a greater or less
quantity of ground in artificial grass, which, after being
cut for two or three years, partly for immediate use, and 
partly to be made into hay, is afterwards pastured for two 
or three years more.  Wheat is sown in some farms in
the low part of the parish, and might with equal advantage
be sown in others; but it is thought to be a crop rather 
too severe for the greatest part of the soil, and a good crop
of barley is considered as not less profitable, because it im-
poverishes the ground less.
   It is to be doubted whether the parish supplies itself in
the article of flour; but there can be no doubt that it ex-
ports a considerable quantity both of barley-grain and oat-
meal, and raises a great deal more beef and mutton than it 
consumes.  The tenants generally begin to low pease and 
oats about the middle of March, if the weather prove fa-
