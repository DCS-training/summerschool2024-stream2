     Statistical Account

   The pensioners who receive regular supply at present, are
in number 36.  Occasional supplies, upon proper recommen-
dation, are often appointed to such persons as are reduced to
temporary distress.  Upon any pressing emergency, the libe-
rality of the opulent part of the inhabitants, is exemplary.
During the late severe winter, near L. 60 sterling were col-
lected, and distributed in the most judicious manner, by a
committee of gentlemen in the town.  Begging is still com-
mon; but the paupers who go about from house to house,
are, for the most part, from other parishes.

   Roads and Milns.-Besides several cross-roads, two public
roads run through the parish; one from Borrowstownness,
leading south to Linlithgow, and the Cleugh iron-works, in
pretty good order, upon which there are several toll-bars;
another running cast and west, (by the water side,) frequent-
ed by travellers from Falkirk and Queensferry.  On the river
Avon, which skirts the parish on the south and west, there
are 5 milns, the property of the Duke of Hamilton.  To the
2 corn-milns, all the barony of Kinniel are thirled with their
oats, and pay as dues the 17th part or peck.  Farmers from
other parishes, pay only the half of this multure.  There are
2 flour-milns, which grind flour for Falkirk Borrowstown-
ness, etc.  The fifth miln was built for the purpose of grind-
ing malt, for the brewers in Borrowstownness; but is em-
ployed at present, in grinding flint for the pottery formerly
mentioned.  The river Avon is a fine stream, well fitted for
the purposes of machinery.  Falls of considerable height may
found; and there is plenty of water, unless when the drought
of summer is uncommonly severe.  The water is also per-
