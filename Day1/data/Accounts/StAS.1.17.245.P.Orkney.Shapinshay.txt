parish the degree of prosperity of which it is capable, the
heritors should reside on their estates, and by the combined in-
fluence of their money, their authority, and example, point out
to them the road to happiness.  The farms, which at present
are too small, should be 2 or 3 of them joined into one; tacks
of considerable length should be granted; the rents and feu-
duties should not be paid in kind, but in money; and ser-
vices of every sort should be abolished, with a view to induce
men of substance and industry to become farmers.  If, to
these improvements, a better mode of agriculture were ad-
ded, and were the people that could be spared from the mak-
ing of kelp, and the cultivation of the ground, employed in
fishing, and some beneficial manufacture, Shapinshay would
soon raise her head high among her sister isles, and would
not suffer by a comparison with almost any other island be-
longing to Scotland.
