founders of fishing villages.  Another principal disadvantage
is the difficulty and uncertainty of communication by water
with the low country.  Though a vessel, called a packet, runs
at times between the Clyde and the Sound of Mull, it has
been only set agoing and continued by private adventurers for
their own interest, and is subjected to no rules calculated for
the public good; no dependance can be had either on the
time of its failing, or the rate of freight.  As the business of
the country, in its present unimproved state, cannot afford suf-
ficient employments were a small bounty allowed by govern-
ment to keep one or two such vessels constantly going, and
rates of freight so fixed that there might be neither danger
of imposition, nor fear of disappointment, the advantages to
these parts, would be greater than can well be estimated. In-
crease of business would, in time, supersede the necessity of a
bounty.

   At the head of Loch Alin Bay, there is a very flattering
appearance of coal; to work which, a feeble attempt has
been made, and a few tons, of good quality found; but, not
being prosecuted with vigour, it has not succeeded.  This is
the more to be regretted, as the mine lies close by the shore
of this good and commodious harbour.  Around the whole
of this loch freestone and limestone, of excellent qualities, are
found in great abundance.  Some years ago an attempt was
made to come at a lead mine on a farm called Lurgbhuidh,
but with little success; though some are of opinion that the
appearances deserved more attention.  At the farm of Ardint-
?? there is a well, into which if green leather be thrown
at night, it will be found perfectly black in the morning.
