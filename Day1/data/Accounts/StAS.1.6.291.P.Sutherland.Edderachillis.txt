larger and fatter than in almost any other place; but again for
some years, few or none of them are found.  The uncommon
goodness of them, and the other fish caught here, must be
imputed to the proximity of the Atlantic and North seas,
and that there are fewer in pursuit of them than in more popu-
lous places.
   In the year 1789, there vessels from Murray, bound for
Barra-head fishing, being forced into Inchard by stress of wea-
ther, and wind-bound there for some days, thought fit to try
their luck where they were, and met with wonderful success
in killing both cod and ling; so that they were in suspense,
whether to proceed to Barra or remain there.  They declared
that, from former experience, they could hardly expect so
great success in so short a time, in Barra; that the cod here
were larger and fatter than there; at the same time of the year;
and, if the ling would come in their proper season, which was
not then commenced in this place, in as great plenty as they
used to do at Barra-head, they could not but think this a bet-
ter fishing station; because what ling they had taken here, they
found to be very good, and rather larger, as well as the cod,
than those they used to find there; so that it is more than pro-
bable, had the joint stock company a proper representation
laid before them of the fitness of this parish for a fishing sta-
tion, they would consider it, (as it in all likelihood is), incom-
parably more deserving of being at the expence of an establish-
ment for the purpose of fishing, than either Ullapool, or
Tobermorie, or perhaps any other place in the Highlands.

   Islands.-In Edderachylis, and on the coast of it, there is a
number of small islands of different sizes, many of them af-
fording pasture to small cattle, especially lambs, in summer
and harvest.  In these spots they require no herding, and are
safe from foxes.  The only inhabited island is Handa.  It is
