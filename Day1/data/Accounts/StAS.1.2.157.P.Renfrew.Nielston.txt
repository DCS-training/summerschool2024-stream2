and 1 1/2 d during the summer quarter, from each scholar for fire
money.  In most parishes, 6 hours attendance from the scho-
lars, during the longer days, and five during the shorter days
of the year, are required.  By keeping evening schools for
arithmetic, church-music, &c. every school-master, especial-

   Session Clerkship.-This office has L. 1 sterling salary paid
out of the public money, 1 s 6 d for registration of marriages,
6 d. for baptisms, 3 d. on a certificate of moral character to a
single person, though, it is believed, a certificate for a whole
family has been charged 6 d.  There is also some small per
centage, for collecting the king's duty of 3 d. on marriages, bap-
tisms, and burials; but this, instead of being an advantage to
the office, has, in most parishes, it is believed, proved a trou-
blesome and vexatious employment, and very disagreeable to the
people at large.  The regulations in the act are not calculated to
extend to Scotland.  In some parts it is difficult to understand its
import.  It is clogged with a qualification on the part of the
collector, the expence of which, in many parishes, may re-
quire more than all the profits he can make.  Many people are
deterred by the expence, triffling as it is, from registering;
and the duty can scarcely bring in L. 1 sterling from each of
the 950 parishes in North Britain, a sum altogether inconside-
rable; and, when the expence of collecting is deducted, it
must be very contemptible indeed.  This is a subject not un-
worthy the attention of persons in power, by whom alone the
inconveniencies attending this act can be remedied.-In many
parishes the church-session bestows the clerkship on the pa-
rish school-master, some in vitam out culpam; others, for rea-
sons that have been found very expedient, confer this office
only for a limited time, or, during the pleasure of the court.
