toes, on which they principally subsist, perhaps for three-
fourths of the year.  There is also some flax raised by the
farmers for their own use.  Major Fraser of Belladrum,
one of the proprietors, has commonly upwards of an acre
of ground annually under flax.  This gentleman, by his
superior skill in farming, his taste for improverments of va-
rious kinds, and his indesatigable activity and industry, has
perhaps done more than most gentlemen in the N. to intro-
duce a spirit of improvement and industry into this part of the
country.  By various improvements, he has considerably rai-
sed the value of his lands, which originally were but a poor
subject.  He has also upon his estate valuable plantations
of forest trees of all kinds, oak, ash, elm, beech, plane,
poplars of various kinds, mountain ash, some maple and
service trees; also laryx, spruce, silver sir, New England
pine, and the common Scotch sir, besides a number of o-
ther trees and shrubs for ornament, near his house and
gardens, all planted by himself within these 30 years.
The Honourable Archibald Fraser of Lovat has also plant-
ed a great variety of forest trees since he has resided in
the country; he has at present a valuable nursery, consist-
ing of many hundred thousand of forest trees, which he
means soon to transplant.  Colonel Fraser of Bruiach, a
gentleman farmer in this parish, has enclosed and subdi-
vided the greatest part of his farm, partly with good stone
fences, and partly with hedge and ditch.  He has also
planted some thousand of forest trees about his farm,
which are at present a great ornament to this part of the
country, and will in process of time, when they grow up,
be a valuable acquisition to the proprietor*.
