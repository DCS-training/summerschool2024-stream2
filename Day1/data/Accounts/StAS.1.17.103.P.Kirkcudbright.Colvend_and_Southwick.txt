tance of dung as a manure, are disusing the practice of laying
their black cattle out in the open fields all winter, and are
now beginning to feed them in houses or shades.  The soil,
not only of this parish, but of almost the whole county, be-
ing warm and dry, in wet summers produces luxuriant crops
of corn and grass.  The crops here have been very plentiful
these last 4 or 5 years.

   Exports, Prices of Wages, etc.-Unpromising as the appear-
ance of the country is, this parish produces considerably more
grain than is consumed by the inhabitants.  There are ge-
nerally exported from it, annually, about 2500 Winchester
bushels of barley to Whitchaven, Lancaster and Liverpool;
and from 3000 to 4000 stones of oatmeal to the sea-port and
manufacturing towns in the west of Scotland; besides consi-
derable quantities of potatoes to the English market.  The
exporting prices of barley here have been, on an average of
the last to years, 2 s. 8 1/2 d. per Winchester bushel, and of
oatmeal 1 s. 9 3/4 d. per stone of 17 lib. 10 oz. overdupois.  Po-
tatoes are fold at from 20 s. to 30 s. per ton.  The prices of
butcher meat here are regulated by the Dumfries market.
The smaller articles of provision, such as butter, fowls; eggs,
etc. are rather high, as there are very frequent opportunities
of conveying them to the sea-port towns in the north of Eng-
land, where they find a ready market.  The wages of me-
chanics, and prices of labour of all kinds, have of late years
risen very high here, as in all the other farming counties in
the south of Scotland.

   Woody and Plantations.-From the great quantities of large
and full grown oak timber, still in good preservation, which
are dug up in the many small spots of peat moss in the pa-
rish, it would appear that natural wood had abounded in it.
