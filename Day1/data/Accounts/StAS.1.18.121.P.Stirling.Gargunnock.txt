himself the proper use of the bounty of Providence, and is
really poor in the midst of his prosperity.  There are few such
in this parish.  They all assemble at church, clean, and in de-
cent attire; many of the women in black cloaks and bonnets,
and the younger sort adorned with ribbons.  It gives general
disgust, however, when the dress is unsuitable to the station.
There is sometimes a contention for pre-eminence in
gaudy shew, which is severely censured, especially when
the maid servant cannot be distinguished from the mistress.
   All the men, with a very few exceptions, wear hats, and
what may be thought remarkable, there is only one wig in
the whole parish.  Tea is universally used.  Even the poorest
families have it occasionally, and the last cup is qualified with
a little whisky, which is supposed to correct all the bad effects
of the tea.  There are few families without some butcher
meat laid up for the winter.  All agree, that they are better
clothed and fed than their forefathers; and seem contented
with the lot assigned them.

   Price of Provisions.-Oat meal is from 15 s. to 17 s. Sterling
per boll; peas and barley meal about 10 s. do; potatoes, corn
measure, 5 s. do; butter 12 s per stone; common cheese 4 s,
and a better kind made on Saturday's evening 5 s. 6 d. per
stone; poultry at a reasonable price.  A good fowl may be
got for 1 s sterling; eggs at 4 d. per dozen.  The price of ne-
cessaries in this parish varies according to the demand at
Stirling on the market days.
   Great scarcity was apprehended in 1783, through the
failure of the preceding crop; but upon the return of peace,
a large quantity of white peas being commissioned from
England by a man of public spirit, and grinded into meal,
assisted the other expedients which were then adopted to
prevent a famine in this part of the kingdom.
