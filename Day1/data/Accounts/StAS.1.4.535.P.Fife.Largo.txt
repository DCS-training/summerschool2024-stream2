of a more obdurate nature, and on a wet bottom.-From
our vicinity to the German Ocean, we are frequently vi-
sited with cold and damp winds from the E. accompanied
sometimes with much rain.  During the spring and sum-
mer months, when the fun has had influence to rarify the
air in the first part of the day, we may look for a very
cooling sea-breeze by three in the afternoon.  But this is
common upon all the coast.  We are indeed more sheltered
from its influence, than many of our neighbours, from our
local situation, and the plantations that surround.  To the
above circumstances, our prevailing disease may be attri-
buted; for from the effect of cold and wet, coughs are
very general, rheumatism and other inflammatory com-
plaints are not unfrequent.  Epidemic disorders sometimes
appear, of which the nervous fever prevails chiefly among
those who are much exposed in the spring and autumn, and
who live at the same time upon a low and spare diet.  Few
children are now cut off by the small pox, as inoculation
is generally introduced with remarkable success.  During
20 years practice, our surgeon has not lost one patient.

   Agriculture, etc.-In improvements, it may be justly
said that this parish has led the way to all the neighbour-
hood.  An open field is scarcely to be met with.  All is
inclosed, either with stone, or with ditch and hedge.  Drain-
ing has not been neglected.  Not only the spouts in the
wet bottomed land have disappeared, but even the useless
marsh and the deceitful bog, by draining, paring, and
burning, have been turned into fruitful fields.  The imple-
ments of husbandry are much improved.  A light well
contrived plough is introduced.  The brake and roller are
in common use.  The diminution of the expence of cul-
ture is no small improvement.  In place of 6 cattle and 2
horses, that seemed to be yoked for show, 20 or 30 years
