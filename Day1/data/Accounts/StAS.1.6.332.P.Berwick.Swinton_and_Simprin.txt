gardens to their heirs, and to be inseparable from their posses-
sions.-This the heritors most readily granted, and 28 of
these zealous heads of families, at their own expence, and in a
great measure by their own hands, did in 1782, add a very
handsome aile to the north side of the church, which was built in
1729.  The old fabric was taken down on account of an apprehen-
sion that it was in a ruinous and dangerous state; whereas on
setting about pulling it down it appeared to be uncommonly
strong, and might have stood for ages.  In the middle of the
church below ground is a vault very neatly built of hewn stone,
extending a considerable length, long the burying place of
the family of Swinton; but being generally full of water, it
is now no longer used for that purpose*.

   Miscellaneous Remark.-Many changes have indeed hap-
pened in the village and in the parish since the year 1754.  At

hand is by immemorial tradition said to allude to a large clew of yarn, by the
dexterous use of which in one hand, while he used his sword with the other,
he dispatched a great wild bear in that field in Swintonhill which, from that
event, still retains the name of Allens Cairn; so it would appear that this
gentleman engaged in the same manly sports, the same dangerous exercises,
and was emulous of the original same of his family, long before his
become great and conspicuous.
