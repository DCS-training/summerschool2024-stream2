subdivisions, must be at least 40 English miles in length, or
above seventy thousand yards.  The fences are about five
feet in height, extremely well executed, and were all done
by days wages, or by men hired by the season.  He dis-
approved of building fences by the piece, as they are sel-

bour was low, but where the people were indolent.  By
giving them employment, and introducing overseers, and a
few servants from other places, where agriculture was
known and industry practised, he enabled his people to pay
the rise of their rents, and taught them how to improve
their own farms; and by generally residing on his estate,
his rent was spent among his tenants, and enabled him to
command an additional quantity of their labour; at the
same time, he was respected in a much higher degree than
he would have been, if, in place of spending his rents in
useful and productive labour, he had either been a prodigal
abroad, or a miser who lived at home, but would not part
with his money to ornament or improve his estate.  It is
only proper to add, that the writer of this account was un-
der no obligations to him, and lives 30 miles from Aboyne,
so that he can have no motive for stating these facts, but a
desire to influence our young nobility, and heirs to great
estates, to imitate these good qualities, and to be at once
useful to themselves and to society.  For let it be remem-
bered, that private vices are not so great public benefits as
private virtues are found to be.  The estate of a prodigal
is often destroyed, without employing so much useful la-
bour, as is exerted in improving the estate of a man of acti-
vity, intelligence, and public spirit.
