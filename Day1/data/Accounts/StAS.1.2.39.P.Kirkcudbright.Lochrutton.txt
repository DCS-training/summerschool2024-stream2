circle of about 170 feet diameter.  This place was excellently
situated for astronomical observations, commands a fine open-
ing to the east, and one of the richest and most extensive pro-
spects in this part of the country.-There are vestiges also,
of several of those towers used antiently, both as places of re-
sidence and of defence, in times of hostility; some of which
appear to have been surrounded with a fossee.  One tower
remains vet entire, and is mentioned in a Scots chronicle,
published in the reign of James VI. by the name of the Castle
of Hills.  The are abesore the entrance is inclosed, and, over
the gate, a porter's lodge was erected.  When this tower was
built is uncertain, but, upon a corner stone of the lodge,
which seems to be of a more modern construction, the year
1598 is inscribed.
