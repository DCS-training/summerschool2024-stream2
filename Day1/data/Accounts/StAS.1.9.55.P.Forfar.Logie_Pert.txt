of the poor at the rate of 24 s. the boll, and were either fold
at a reduced price, or given gratis; besides a present of 10
bolls, consisting of a mixture of oats, barley, rye, &c. recei-
ved then from Government, was distributed among the poor.
Oat-meal here at that time sold at 20 s. the boll.-There
are two principal alehouses, in a manner necessary, as be-
ing on public roads, with one or two more, perhaps, less
requisite.  The bad effects of there on the morals of the
people are not very perceptible, though the increase of pu-
blic houses both in town and country is always to be re-
gretted.  The heavy Excise laws, and the enormous duty
on malt, make beer less brewed in private families than
formerly, though perhaps, whisky is more used.  Within
these ten years past, near 30 new houses or cottages have
been built in the parish where there were none before;
perhaps, about half a dozen during that space have been
pulled down, or suffered to fall into ruins.  Employing cot-
tagers in agriculture, is thought by some of the farmers
here to be less frugal than keeping hired servants in the
house, though it no doubt, is more favourable to popula-
tion.-The meadows and lower grounds on the Northesk
are very subject to inundations, which have sometimes done
considerable damage, especially in the time of harvest.  In
1774, when the river rose to an almost unprecedented
height, it swept away a great deal of cut corn, and laid flat
sundry fields that were uncut, spoiling them with sand;
and last autumn, an uncommon flood swept away from a
farm in this neighbourhood, on the opposite banks of the
river, more than half an acre of ground, with about 60 bolls
of lime lying upon fallow; at any time six hours of wind
and rain from the S. or S. E. will make it rise, so as to o-

able meteor was seen here, as it was through the most part of
the kingdom, as well as In some foreign parts.  It made
