   Climate, Diseases.-The air is remarkably pure and
healthy.  A native of this parish died in the neighbour-
hood some months ago, aged 106, having followed his
usual occupation in the fields, and retained the full posse-
sion of his mental faculties till a few days before his death.
The diseases chiefly prevalent are the rheumatism and fe-
vers, occasioned by the poorer people living in cold damp
houses, and resting after labour in wet clothes.  People of
better station are not so much liable to these distempers.
When these fevers once begin, they often spread far and
wide, as the people, from mistaken notions of sympathy
and charity, crowd the house, and even the bed-room of
the sick, which is kept as close often as possible.  These
catch and spread the infection, thinking that they do no-
thing amiss, and that no harm will befal them but by the
special decree and interposition of Heaven.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster, the population
in 1755 was 1157.
