part of the parish of Rathven, amounted to 1719.  Of which,
in the parish of Cullen 1214; of these, males 550, females
664.  In the annexed part of Rathven 505; males 271, fe-
males 234.  Of the above numbers in Cullen, and the annex-
ed part of Rathven, there are under 7 years of age, males 140,
females 115.  The increase of the population has been only
in the town of Cullen, and in the sea-towns of Cullen and
Portknockies: for during the periods of the above average-
calculations, there were several farms well peopled, which,
after that, were enclosed for the Earl of Findlater's own ac-
commodation, and are since uninhabited.  The average of
baptisms annually, is about 45, marriages 12.  The bulk of
the people are of the Established religion.  Before the year
1782, there was not one Catholic in the parish, at present
there are about 30, and 8 Episcopalians.

Cullen seems originally to have been a Chapel of Ease for the
accommodation of the people of that corner of the parish of
Fordyce, and the contiguous part of Rathven; there were 2
churches or chapels, that of St. Mary and St. Anne; the lat-
ter was a prebend.  The present church is compounded of the
two former; it is very old, not well lighted, and too small
for the congregation.  The Earl of Findlater and Seafield is
patron.  The stipend consists of 40 L. 18 s. 10 8/12 d. in money,
including 50 merks for communion elements, 2 chalders of
barley and 2 chalders of meal.  The glebe consists of 4 1/2 acres
and some falls; but the minister has no grass, nor any allow-
ance for it.  The manse was repaired about 7 years since, at
which time there was a complete set of offices built and co-
vered with slates.  Lord Findlater is proprietor of the whole
parish, except some property belonging to the town-council;
one small heritage, consisting of a house, a garden, and an acre
