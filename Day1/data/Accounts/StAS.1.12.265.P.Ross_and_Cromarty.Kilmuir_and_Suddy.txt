<FOOTNOTE>

+There are many more children born in this parish than the number con-
tained in this report, such as are baptized by the Episcopal clergymen, and the
names of those children are not engrossed in the parish register; and, I suppose,
they keep no register of their own, so that the number cannot be ascertained
with any degree of exactness, but may be supposed at 10.  No account at all
can be given of the number of deaths in this parish, as there is no register of bu-
rials kept, besides, that many of the inhabitants bury in the neighbouring church-
yards, although there be two burial places in this same parish, one at Suddy,
and one at Kilmuir.  The people if this parish, in general, are healthy, though
not long lived.  There are few instances of men's arriving at the age of 80 years;
and this may be owing to their being inured to hard labour from their youth,
from their eating little or none of butcher meat, and but very little milk; the
principal food of the common people being oatmeal and potatoes, with a little
fish in the fishing season.  There are a few women now living in this parish, who
have attained to the age of 90 years.
