   Marmor hoc quo assidens saepe curavi genium mortuo
mihi imponi volui.  Siste viator quisquis es, discumbas licet,
et si copia est marmore hoc uti ego olim fruis casis.  Hoc si
rite feceris monumentum non violabis nec manes meos ha-
bebis iratos.  Vale et Vive!  Alter his death, the property
was acquired by Mr Forbes.
   The upper part of Monk's Burn runs upon rotten whin,
of which all the Pentland Hills, to the east of it, seem to be
entirely composed; and about half way between Monk's
Rigg and Haugh, near the burn, there is a chalybeate spring
of a very strong quality.  One of the Pentland Hills, along
which a road to the north side is formed, and in part metal-
led, is composed of a rotten whin, of a beautiful reddish buff-
colour, like Kensington gravel, so much admired for walks,
or the appearance that some kinds of clay takes when burnt.
   There is also on the side of the same road a thin vein of
clay, of a light pink or lilac tint.  This road has remained
unfinished, and of course impassable for some years, although
it might be compleated, in the most sufficient manner for
less than 150 L. Sterling, which would give a full and easy
supply of both lime and coal, to those on the north side of
the hills; while, by a strange oversight during this time,
very large sums have been expending by the inhabitants of
that district, in uneffectual trials to obtain what they can so
much more easily, and with certainty, at so small an expence,
bring within their reach.  On the east of Monk's Burn there
is no lime; but on the west, not only the low grounds are
full of both lime and coal, but incrusting, or lime springs,
are to be found, more than two thirds of the way up, both
the hills of Spittal and Carlops.  This is contrary to what
has been asserted, and to the theory of mineralogists, that
mountains are entirely composed of primitive rocks, such as
