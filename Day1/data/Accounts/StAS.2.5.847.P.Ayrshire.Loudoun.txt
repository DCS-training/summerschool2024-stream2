		As she was up on the househead,
		Behold on looking down,
		She saw Adam o' Gordon and his men

		Seven years I served thee, fair ladie,
		You gave me meat and fee,
		But, now I am Adam o'Gordon's man,

		I'll wrap thee on a feather bed,
		Thy warrand I shall be.

		And so would I the brown,

		Out then spake the Lady Margaret,
		As she stood on the stair,
		The fire was at her goud garters,
		The lowe was at her hair.
		             11.
		I would give the black, she says,
		And so would I the brown,
		For a drink of you water,
		That runs by Galston town.
                             12.
		Out then spake fair Annie,
		She was baith jimp and sma',
		O row me in a o' sheets,
		And tow me down the wa'.
