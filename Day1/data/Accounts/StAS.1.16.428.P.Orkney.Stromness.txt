the remaining fourth part is the property of nearly 100
small heritors.
   As the bishoprick lands are annexed to the Crown, and
cannot be transferred, it is only the remaining part, the
property of private individuals, that can come into the
market for sale.  Within these last 20 years, above one
half of this remaining saleable property has been sold, and
some of it at from 30 to 50 years purchase.  There is no
reason to regret that property changes its masters, for these
new proprietors are the best improvers of the soil, by
inclosing, adopting new modes of agriculture, building com-

made any money, chuse to vest it in lands or houses, the
inland trade being limited, and they do not incline to esta-
blish manufactures, or engage in foreign trade.  The de-
mand also by shipping of some of the articles raised, and
the increased prices given, have tended to raise the value
of property, although these prices are still inadequate to
what the farmer might expect, considering the great in
crease of expence in rearing these commodities.

1653, there were 145 heritors, exclusive of the bishoprick
lands then vested in the Crown.  At that time there was

name of Sinclair, of very inconsiderable property, although
these were the greatest names in this county so: merly;
one of the Sinclair's having born the title of Prince of
Orkney, and Duke of Oldenburgh, and was allied by mar-
riage to the royal family of Denmark.-In 1753, when a
