     Statistical Account

I am exceedingly happy to have it in my power to establish the
fact upon the most unequivocal evidence.  The gentlemen
who were called to witness the planting and raising of the
potatoes, very properly published an account of the whole
operation in the Newspaper of the day, for the benefit of
the public.  And happily the original attestation is now in
my hands.
   A copy of it will surely be acceptable, and deemed strictly
statistical; more especially, as it points out the manner in
which the operation was carried on, and the very high state
of improvement to which Mr Graham had arrived.

   "We John Marshall of Townhead, Henry Mar-
"shall of Ruck-hill, and Alexander Maxwell present
"barlie of Kilsyth, went at the desire of Robert
"Graham of Tamrawer, and attended his servants upon
"the 21st of April 1762.
   "We saw them measure an exact peck of potatoes,
"which we saw them plant with the dibble and draper.
"Each set was distant 18 and 21 inches length-ways
"of the ploughed ridge, and between 12 and 15 inches
"across the ridge.
   "And upon the 26th of October following, we
"did also attend Mr Graham's servants, while raising
"the produce of the said peck of potatoes, which we
"then saw measured on the ground, amounting to 16
"bolls and a half, which is 264 peck, arising from
"the said one peck.  The truth of all which is attested
"by us, and
