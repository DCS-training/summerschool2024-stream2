by the title of Lord Altree, having created the Abbey lands
a temporal of lordship in his favour; this peerage became
extinct, and the Abbey lands fell to the Earl Marif-
chal.  Anno 1637, William 6th Earl Marischal obtained
a new charter from the Crown of the Abbey lands, besides
the tithes great and small of the parish of Peterhead, the
parsonage of the church, salmon and white-fishing.  The
following lands are mentioned, as situate in the parish of
Peterhead: "Terras de Lehill, terras de Munchishill, ter-
"ras de Granig, (at present Grange), de Raebill, (where
"the windmill at present stands), de Fisherburn, de Peter-

who thought the price high, and had an option to consider
for some time, and relinquish the bargain if he thought pro-
per; when the time was nearly elapsed, he gave in his re-
nunciation, which was accepted very readily by one of the
Governors, who never approved of the sale, and put the
paper into the charter-chest marking on the back of it, a
miraculous escafe.  He was right in his opinion; in 1755
the rent was raised to L. 870, and in 1794 to L. 1040 Ster-
