   Rent of the Parish, and Number of Proprietors.-The
valued rent of the parish is L. 2364, 15 s. Scots.  The real
rent is not known.  There are four proprietors, of whom
only one resides in the parish.  The state of Echt was long
in possession of proprietors of the name of Forbes, and was
sold by them about 60 years ago to the late Earl of Fife,
who settled it upon his second son, the Honourable Alex-
ander Duss, the present proprietor.  He removed his place
of residence in the year 1768, from the old house at Echt to
Housedale, another part of the parish, about two English
miles from the old house of Echt, where he has built a
commodious house and offices, and made out a garden of
2 acres, a great part of which is surrounded with a stone and
lime wall of about 12 feet high.  He has also enclosed and
improved, from a barren moor, which produced nothing but
heath, broom, and surze, about 80 Scotch acrres, which he
has laid down with turnip, barley, oats, and different grasses.
He has likewise planted at Housedale about 150 acres of

at present in a thriving condition.
