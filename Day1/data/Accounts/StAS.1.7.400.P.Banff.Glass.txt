     Statistical Account

there is no boat or stone-bridge over it: Hence many acci-
dents happen.  Not fewer than 7 persons have lost their
lives in the river within these 30 years past.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report in 1755,
the number of souls was 1000.  For these 34 years past,
the amount of examinable persons, at an average, was about
900.  Last year, the number of souls was 942.  This pre-
sent year, (April 1791), the number is 970, which is consi-
derably less than for years before 1782.  There are about 12
or 14 Seceders, some of whom have families, and these are
not reckoned.  When the present incumbent entered, there
were about 45 Papists, and 4 Nonjurors; but, at present,
there are none.  During 36 years, from 1756 to 1791 in-
clusive, the baptisms in this parish were,-males, 345,-fe-
males, 350.

   Effects of 1782.-The King's bounty in 1782, transmitted
by the Barons of Exchequer, of 50 bolls meal, with what the
funds of the parish afforded, preserved the lives of the poor.
The people, at that period, were meagre and ghastly; but
the diseases that were apprehended did not follow, owing, as
was supposed, to their seldom getting a full meal of such
corrupted victual as the season produced.  So little produc-
tive was the oats or barley, that many were known not to
have a peck of meal from a boll of dried corn; and the co-
lour so black, that it resembled more the ordinary dust in the
mills, than meal for the use of man.  The tenants were great-
ly reduced; and many of their cottars were obliged to retire
to the manufacturing towns for employment, by which the
numbers are fewer than before.

   Rent, Prices, Wages, and Crops.-The valued rent is 2250 l.
