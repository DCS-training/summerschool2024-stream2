per cart, the out-put in the year will be 22135 tons and a-half;
the price at the hill is somewhat better than 2 s. 6 d. per ton
the total value is 2750 L. Sterling, of which the coalliers re-
ceive 1375 L; the remainder goes for lordship, and to support
the hills-men and gin boys, along with the tear and wear of
the work.
   According to the calculation of men skilled in coal-mines,
these 20,000 tons will at least exhaust three acres of coal an-
nually, a waste, which, great as it may appear, we are able
to support for 150 years to come; but in reality we are rais-
ing this season, at least, double of what was raised former-
ly, nay, 10 times more than what was put out about 20 years
ago; this great quantity of coal is used in the following man-
ner:  The two printfields consume annually 3500 tons; a-
bove 2100 tons is used in burning lime; and the remainder
in supplying the parishes of Campsie, Fintray, Balfrone, Ki-
lairn, Strathblane, Baldernock, and partly Kirkintilloch and
Kilsyth.  It is doubtful if even yet the coal in this district
be wrought to advantage; in reality, we are as yet but
working the crop of the coal; it being absolutely necessary
that they should either drive their levels, or erect their steam
engines upon the dip side, so that they might work to the
rise.  Many great fields at this moment ly buried under wa-
ter, owing to this defectll.

llNo map being made of these subterraneous works, and no documents
being in the possession of the proprietors, to point out when and how such a
field of coal was wrought, it is only by some vague tradition, handed down
from one generation of coalliers to another, that we pretend to judge whether
the ground be wasted or not; so that too often the pit is put down upon a
trouble, or waste, to the great detriment of the adventurer; which mistake
might be easily rectified, by each proprietor getting an accurate chart made out
of these subterraneous works, for the benefit of posterity; besides many lives
