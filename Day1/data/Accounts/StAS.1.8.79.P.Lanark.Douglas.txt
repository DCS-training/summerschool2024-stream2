gulated by the superior quality of either work for the time,
and by the caprice of the purchasers.  But for 20 years past,
the annual produce on both estates has been from 50,000 to
70,000 loads of 2 1/2 cwt.  Taking the medium 60,000 loads,
at 5 d. per load, at the heugh, the produce in money is 1250 L.
The coal heugh, about 3 miles above the town of Douglas, is
by most people thought the best coal.  There is plenty of lime
and free-stone here.

   Rent.-The holm and croft land let at from 15 s. to 20 s.
per acre; the field land from 5 s. to 2 s. according to the
quality; the best land near the town from 30 s. to 40 s.
nay, some land in Lord Douglas's parks, after lying in lee for
a number of years, has been let for two crops at 3 L. 3 s. per
acre.  Arable farms let at from 40 L. to 100 L.; sheep farms
from 50 L. to 200 L.

necessity, that the people have adopted this mode of farming;
long experience having shewn them, that oats are the crop
that can be most depended on.  And indeed, such is the seve-
rity of the seasons in this country, that very frequently the
bear and pease are destroyed by the frost before they come to
maturity:  And though oats are a more hardy grain, they are
stinted in their growth by the cold, and, in particular late sea-
sons, rendered in a great manner useless, both for man and
beast.  In the year 1782, there was not a boll of tolerable
oat-meal produced in the parish.  There was neither bear
nor pease; and the oat-meal was little better than the dust of
other years, and very little of it.  Great quantities of white
