     of Cross, Burness, etc.

   Animals.-The quadrupeds are such as are common; horses,
bulls, cows, sheep, swine, and rabbits.-The domestic, birds
are geese, hens, and ducks.-The wild sea fowl, soland geese,
sea gulls, auks, and a great variety of ducks.  Swans resort
here in winter, and go northward in spring.-Wild land fowl
are, eagles, ravens, crows, hawks, pigeons, and other common
birds.  A small bird, rather less than a sparrow, resorts here
in winter, supposed to be the same with what is by some cal-
led the Empress's bird in Russia, and is called by the people
here oat-fowls, because they prey on the oats.  Some who
have eat both kinds say, this bird is equally delicate eating as
the ortolan.  Grey plovers are here in great numbers in
winter.  The lapwing comes in February; and hatches here
in summer.  These islands are not remarkable for breeding
cattle of any singular qualities or value.

   Population.-The population, either in the charge of Cross-
kirk, or in that of Ladykirk, cannot be precisely ascertained
preceding 1787.  Subjoined is the population then and at
present, as follows:
