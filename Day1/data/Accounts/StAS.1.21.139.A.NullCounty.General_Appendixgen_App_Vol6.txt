and conduct of our fathers, may, as prudence shall direct, be
appointed to meet the public eye, or to rest in oblivion.

   Wadset,-Before commercial credit multiplied the signs of
wealth, money being of great value, the money lender had it
frequently in his power to make his own terms.  The rich
farmer seldom opened the chest containing his hoard to any,
but to a proprietor of land, who commonly assigned as his se-
curity one or more farms, rent free, until the money borrow-
ed by him should be repaid. This was called a wadset.  Num-
bers of these existed in this parish and county, but are now
universally redeemed.

   Agriculture.-The arable part of most farms was divided
into intown, sold, and burnt land.  The intown (a third of
which being by rotation annually in bear) was always crop-
ed for grain.  A part of folding ground, enriched by the dung
of sheep and of cattle, penned thereon in Summer, during
the night and heat of the day, or fauched, (a kind of bastard
fallow), and manured by a little compost dung, bore three,
four, or five crops, and then, according to the quality of the
ground, was allowed to rest four, five or six years.  The burnt
land was pared by the plough, and the parings, collected in
heaps and reduced to ashes, were spread upon the field, by
which rich crops were for a long time produced on hill and
dale.  When the repetition of this practice reduced the soil
upon the hills, the ridge was frequently gathered; and the
