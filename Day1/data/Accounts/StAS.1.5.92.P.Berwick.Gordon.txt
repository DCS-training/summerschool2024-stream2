   Agriculture.-Since the turnip husbandry commenced,
much greater quantities of corn have been raised in the pa-
rish.  In the year 1775, one farm produced no more rough
bear, than what was necessary to sow the ground again, pay
the servants their proportion of wages, and maintain the fa-
mily.  The same farm, within these three years, produced
barley for these necessary purposes (which is superior to bear
2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. the boll,) and from it were sold 240 bolls,
in the Lothian markets, at 18 s. the boll and upwards.  The 
proprietors, sensible of the industry and activity of their te-
nants, have adopted a wise plan to promote further improve-
ments, by giving them a renewal for 21 years, several years
previous to the expiration of the old leases.

     hurch.-The king is undoubted patron of this parish.  In
1767 the Earl of Home claime the patronage, and raised
an action of declarator, when, after a litigation of 18
months, his claim was dismissed for want of evidence.  The
incumbent, in consequence of that decision, was settled in
1770.  The number of heritors is 8.  None of them reside
in the parish.

   Poor.-The poor are regularly supplied by a meeting of
the heritors, minister and elders, who asses the parish half
yearly for that purpose.  Their numbers have been from 12
to 24, young and old, yearly.  In 1783 oat-meal was at 2 s.
6 d. and upwards, the stone, bear and pease-meal were scarce-
ly to be had.  The heritors of the parish gave money to the
kirk-session, to enable them to sell oat-meal to poor house-
holders at a discount of 8 d. and 6 d. the stone, which was of
great use to preserve them from want.  White pease were
imported at Leith and Fisherrow in spring and summer.
The farmers and minister brought white pease from Leith,
