with arithmetic. The children of the labouring classes are in ge-
neral sent to school at an earlier period of life, and leave it sooner
than formerly, so that, unless they are attended to by parents or
masters, or have the benefit of a Sabbath school, they too soon
forget what they have learned. A Sabbath school has been long
taught in this parish, but is now attended chiefly by girls.
  Library.-There is no public library for the use of the parish,
but Sabbath scholars and others are supplied with a few appro-
priate books from the manse. There is, indeed, a library of some
value belonging to a heritor, to which a certain class of the parish-
ioners have access, if they choose to avail themselves of the privi-
lege. But the very terms upon which it is granted, operate as an
exclusion from the carefully secured treasure. The books, as well
as the acres, are strictly entailed. The heir of entail is prohibited
from lending a book to his neighbours; but be is bound to keep a
suitable room for the library in his house, and to allow free access
to it to the minister and other gentlemen, there to read and study,
but all women and children are expressly excluded.
  Poor.-The poor in this parish, whose average number is about
7, and who get from 4s. to 10s. per month, according to their cir-
cumstances, are supplied by collections at the church door, by the
interest of a small sum of money, and voluntary contributions by
the heritors. The collections and interest amount to L. 18 or L. 20,
and nearly as much is contributed annually by the heritors. In-
stances of praiseworthy delicacy respecting dependence upon the
poor's fund sometimes occur, but a very different feeling is evi-
dently increasing. The session records and parish re ster are re-
gularly kept. The date of the earliest is 1660.
