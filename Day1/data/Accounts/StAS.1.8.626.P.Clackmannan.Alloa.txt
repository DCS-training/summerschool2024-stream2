   Wages.-The former and present rate of wages is stated in
the annexed tables*; besides which, the out-door ploughmen
have some small emoluments, such as liberty to plant 2 or 3
pecks of potatoes, etc. etc.  Servants and tradesmen are al-
lowed no meat or beer; sometimes in harvest they get a dram,
Few or no servants are hired by the month, or harvest time,

<FOOTNOTE>

*About the time of the Union, the common day's wages of a labourer were
from 5 d. to 6 d. per day.  When livery meal was given, 2 pecks, or 16 L b.
Dutch weight, (about equal to 17 L b. 4 1/2 avoirdupoise), per week, seem to have
been always the fixed quantity.  Formerly, most part of the ploughmen lived in,
the farmer's houses, and had their fees. (or wages), and bounties; which were,

Those ploughmen, who did not live in the farmer's house, had, besides their
livery meal, 6 1/2 bolls per annum, and 4d. per week, under the name of kitchen
money.  In order to know the wages of the out-door ploughman, we must put
a value on the meal.  This is done in the following table, by taking the price
of meal, on an average of 25 years preceding the year specified.
