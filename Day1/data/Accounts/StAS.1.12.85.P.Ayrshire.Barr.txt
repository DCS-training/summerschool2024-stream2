the coarse made cattle to a keeping condition only, will make
the Carrick black cattle thorough fat; and that pasture which
can bring the latter into a middling condition only, will scarce
be able to keep the former in life.  Cattle reared in this
country, and fold at the age of 3, or 3 1/2 years (from the moors)
will bring from 4 L. 10 s. to 5 L. 5 s. each; and if put upon low
lying enclosed pasture for an year, they will be ready for the
English market, and bring from 6 L. 10 s. to 8 L. each.  This
parish is supposed to hold from 1500 to 2000 black cattle.

   Cheviot Sheep, etc.-It would be well for the farmers here,
could as much be said for their sheep stock; but this cannot
be expected, so long as so many black cattle are reared in the
parish.  They not only lessen the quantity of food, being per-
mitted to pasture among the sheep, but poach the surface with
their feet, and even the grass which springs where the cattle
dung, is unwholesome for sheep.  Sheep in this parish are in-
ferior in point of strength to the sheep in Crawfordmoor, but
make better fat.  Wedders, 3 and 4 years old from the common
hill pasture here, when come to the best state of flesh the
grounds bring them, between Michaelmas and Martinmas,
will weigh from 10 to 14 pound English the quarter, and pro-
duce tallow from 9 to 12 pounds English, and sell at from 10 L.
to 13 L. the score.  The pasture ground of this parish is for
most part dry; its hills consist partly of heath, but mostly
what is called white ground, and, as one might judge, not un-
favourable to the improvement of wool, by means of the Che-
viot breed.  The writer of these remarks is the rather inclin-
ed to think so from the following experiment, now making in
this parish: Two score of ewe hogs, and a ram of the Che-
viot breed, were put upon a farm called Tarrasessock, June
1792, the property of the Earl of Cassillis, possessed by Mr.
M'Hutchson of Changue.  This farm is one of the highest in
