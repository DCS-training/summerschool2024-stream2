     of Kilsyth.

ny, there was formerly a tumulus or cairn of stones.  That
this tumulus was a burying ground or funeral pile, is certain;
for an urn and ashes were some time ago found in it.  And
there is a faint tradition, that it was erected over the dead,
slain in a memorable battle, fought between the natives and
the Romans; which was the forerunner of a peace.  It is but
justice to say, however, that the same tradition bears, that
the natives were surprized unarmed, and therefore, had re-
course to the first offensive weapon that offered, which was
their scyths or sickles.  And from this circumstance, it is said,
the district derived its name.
   The etymology of Monaebrugh, is as uncertain.  Gentle-
men acquainted with the Gaelic suppose it to be a compound
of monaugh, hilly, and ebroch, a place full of rivulets.  And it
must be acknowledged, that this is descriptive of the general
appearance of that district.  For it consists of an endless suc-
cession of hill and dale, from one end to the other, and it is
intersected by a great variety of rills.
   Others have supposed it to be of Latin original. If so, it is
perhaps a compound of mona, a monk, and Ebroch, the name
of a small rivulet which runs through this district.  And in
confirmation of this, there is a tradition in this parish, that a
certain saint, whose name is not recorded, had a hermitage in
a sequestered glen upon this very rivulet.

   Situation.-The whole parish is situated in the county of
Stirling.  But it is the southermost extremity of it.  The
form of it is an irregular oblong square, running in length
along the great high way, leading from Edinburgh to Glas-
gow, 7 miles.  The breadth is nearly one half of its length.
Of course, it contains nearly 24 miles square, or about 15000
acres.  The rivers Carron on the north, and Kelvin on the
south, Inchwood burn on the west, and the Bush burn on the
