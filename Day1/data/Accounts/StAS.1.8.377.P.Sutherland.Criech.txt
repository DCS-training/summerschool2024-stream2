but, on the contrary, to encourage them, by every possible
means, to improve their little spots of land, to erect for
themselves more comfortable houses, and to build them of
more durable materials.  On these estates, there are some
stations remarkably well adapted for villages.  They lie on
the banks of the Kyle, which is a frith or arm of the sea, na-
vigable for 7 miles, by vessels of a considerable burden, and
for small crast, about 15 miles more. in all, this Frith is navi-
gable for 24 miles.  To give a beginning to these villages,
a company is formed, consisting chiefly of Glasgow gentlemen,
who have subscribed a capital of 3000 L. and made some pro-
gress in erecting a manufacture of spinning cotton by jennies,
and of weaving their yarn.  Instructed persons are sent from
Glasgow to conduct the work, and to teach the natives of the
country the arts of spinning and weaving.  The town is lot-
ted out, and same houses for weaving are in forwardness.
Vessels of 50 tons burden can land their cargoes at this
place.
   A second village, two miles lower down the Kyle, is also
lotted out, and a large warehouse already built.  Here, the
water is deep enough to receive any vessel, that can enter
the Kyle, and come over the bar, (known by the name of the
Gizzen Brigs,) at its mouth, on which there is 4 fathom water
at spring tides, and 6 or 7 feet less at neap tides.  Here also,
a gentleman has undertaken to establish the weaving of linen,
and to encourage the extension of the spinning of yarn all
around the country.  At both manufactures, apprentices will
he instructed in the art of weaving, in order to introduce that
art into the boules of the small tenants, as it is found already
to be in the shires of Renfrew, Perth, Angus and Aberdeen.
By these means, constant employment will be found for peo-
ple of all ages and sexes, and a considerable market opened for
the productions of the country.
