   Character and Habits of the People.--The people are above the
middle size.  They excel in athletic exercises, and have gained
prizes in the gymnastics of St Ronans.  Harvest home, halloween,
new-year's-day, and Valentine's eve, are observed with a kind of re-
cottages, they in general exhibit taste and neatness.  The ordinary
food of the common people is oatmeal porridge to breakfast; kale
or broth, with sometimes a little animal food, to dinner; potatoes,
whole or mashed; porridge or sowens, (a preparation from oatmeal
siftings,) with milk, to supper, and frequently bread and cheese,
or butter.  Those who have little gardens attached to their dwell-
ings have always a supply of wholesome culinary vegetables.  Loaf-
bread has almost superseded the use of oaten cakes.  The farmers,
who were wont to mess with their servants, have now their separate
dining parlours.
  Drinking bouts are less frequent and less protracted than they

population than the northern half, but the difference is not material.  As the old pa-
rish of Kilbueho is in some respect still undivided, it would have been better to
have given all its statistics in one return, particulaxing the different proportions, but,
owing to the misunderstanding, this could not be effected.
