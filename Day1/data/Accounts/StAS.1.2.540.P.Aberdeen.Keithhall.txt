     Statistical Account

staple manufacture of this county was ferges or fingerings.
And, as the sheep were formerly much more numerous than
at present, and both the raw materials, and the price of la-
bour, belonged to the country people, this was incomparably 
a better manufacture, than the knitting of stockings, from
coarf English wool.  It was lost by bad workmanship.  A
stamp-office for this woolen manufacture, would have saved a
valuable branch of commerce.  Very little linen is made, and
still less flax grows in this district.-  The stocking manu-
factory brings in from L. 450 to L. 600 a year, according to
the price of stockings, and the dearness of provisions.-
In 1782 and 1783, the average price of stockings was below is,
for manufacturing, each pair.  But provisions were to dear,
that the people wrought incessantly; and, by the best accounts,
18,000 pair of stockings were made yearly, at the time, in
this district.

   Carriages, Carts, etc.-  There is only one carriage kept in
this district.  There are 63 double carts, of which about 40
are pretty good; there are 40 single carts, most of which are
very bad.  Thirty-five years ago, there was but one cart in the
parish of Keith Hall; and the dung was carried on horses
backs in creels; the men  filled the creels, and the women led
the horses.  No woman is now employed in this fervile work.
But the women are thought to be less healthy and vigorous,
since they were confined to the knitting of stockings.  Some
better manufacture may be established.-  Within these 20
years. the whole clothing of the inhabitants was raised and
manufactured in the district, or in the neighbourhood.  Now
at least one third is brought from England; and the difference
between the value of the dress used now, and what was used
so years ago, would nearly pay the rents of the two parishes.
