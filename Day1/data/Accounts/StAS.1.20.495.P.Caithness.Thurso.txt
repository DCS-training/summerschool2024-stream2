of Scotland, they are of Celtic extraction; but along the sea-
coast of Caithness, and throughout all the northern and ma-

which was spoken by a variety of tribes or nations, who, in

it is spelt by the Icelandic historians, is easily ascertained.
In that language, aa signifies a great river, and it was in
this parish, that the principal river in the neighbourhood,

   SECT. II.  Situation and Extent.-The town of Thurso
is situated, on the north-west side of the coast of Caithness,
at the top of a spacious and beautiful bay, where the river
Thurso runs into it.  The figure of the parish is irregular,

ocean, to the north, and east; and by the parish of Reay,
on the west.  There is also a separate district, called Dora-

of the parish will appear from the annexed map.
