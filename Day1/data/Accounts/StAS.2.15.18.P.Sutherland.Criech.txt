ever seen. It is not, however, above five inches wide, and would
not repay labour.
Soil.-There is not in the parish very much variety of soil:
the usual gravelly and peaty soil of the mountains preponderates
over every other. There is some good clay soil at Pulrossie, at
Flode, at Rosehall, and elsewhere on the shores of the Frith.
At Rosehall is to be found fine natural meadow pasture; and the
hills are pastured by sheep and cattle.

The last is the only resident heritor; and the real rent, exclu-
sive of salmon-fishings, may be about L. 3700 Sterling per an-
num.
     Antiquities.-In the 11th or 12th century a contest of the
inhabitants with the Da'nes is recorded to have occurred at Drin-
leah, near Bonar Bridge, whence the iniaders were driven back
with great loss to their ships at Portnacoulter,-now the Meikle
Ferry.
     The extraordinary number of tumuli or graves on the scene of
action, while they attest the truth of the tradition, and the great-
ness of the slaughter, cannot fail to excite the wonder of reflect-
ing persons at the great numbers who must have been engaged,
and the consequent density of the population at that remote time.
Manyof these tumuli have been opened, but nothing was found
except three or four large stones I artificially arranged in' each.
On the summit of the Doune or hill of Criech there is a spe-
cimen of those very puzzling relics'of antiquity, the vitrified forts.
It is considered by persons conversant with these appearances as a
good specimen, and has been visited and described by Sir George
S.Mackenzie, Bart., and by others.
