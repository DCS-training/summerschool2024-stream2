   Parochial Funds.-The provision for the poor of the parish is
but low, there being no assessment for this purpose.  They are
chiefly supported, as formerly observed, by the private charity of
the inhabitants.

   The only source, besides church collections, from which the
poor derive aid, is a tax on marriages, and fines imposed for cer-
tain delinquencies.  In some urgent cases, a little aid is occasion-
ally given to persons who are not on the poor's roll.  There ap-
pears to be no reluctance on the part of the poor to apply for pa-
rochial relief, nor do they seem to think it at all degrading.

                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The chief feature which seems to distinguish the present state
of the parish from that which existed at the date of the last Sta-
tistical Account, is the great increase of population, and what has
resulted, in a great measure, as a consequence from it, the greater
poverty of the people.  The great depression which took place in
the value of produce soon after the conclusion of the last war, and
the total failure of the kelp manufacture since that period, gave
a severe blow to many parts of the Highlands and Islands.
From this last source, many proprietors formerly derived a hand-
some revenue, and the people found employment for themselves
and their families, accompanied with a fair remuneration for their
labour.  This resource is now entirely cut off.
   It seems to be now universally admitted, that in the Highlands and
Islands in general, there is a great superabundance of population,-
and to no part of the country, so far as my acquaintance ex-
tends, is the observation more applicable than to this island. The
present crisis in the state of the population seems to have been acce-
lerated here by the system of crofting, or dividing the land into mi-
nute portions,-a system adopted at first with the humane inten-
tion of accommodating as many poor families as possible, but
which afforded only a very temporary relief, and I fear has
