     PARISH OF KILMANY,

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF FIFE, PRESBYTERY OF CUPAR),

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN COOK, Minister.

     Name, etc.

   THE parish of Kilmany has the same name with that
by which the most considerable village it possesses is
distinguished.  From a small burying-ground* which sur-
rounds the church, the name has probably been derived.
   This village, which the name, the number of people it
contains, and the vicinity of the church, distinguish above
every other in the parish, is about 5 miles distant from

<FOOTNOTE>

*Kilmany is, according to common opinion, of Celtic origin.  If only
that part of the word which signifies a burying-ground be Celtic, it will not
be a singular instance of such composition in our mixed language.  The
other villages in the parish have, in general, either names descriptive of their
situation, or those of former possessors.
