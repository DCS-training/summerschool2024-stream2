modern system.  Suppose that 200 horses may be able to la-
bour what is now done by 600 oxen.  Suppose the value of
the necessary stocking to be thus much the same, calculating
each pair of horses as equal in value to 6 oxen, say 24 L. which,
for the above number, supposed necessary for the purpose of
husbandry in this parish, is 2400 L.*

The interest of this sum, sunk in a stocking of oxen, may be

The interest of the same sum, sunk in a stock-
   ing of horses, is at least 10 per cent. being,

The smith and ferrier's charge cannot be under

Suppose the consumpt of oats to be a peck per

<FOOTNOTE>

*We have a number of small horses, even by the present
system of forming; but these are maintained at a considerable
expence; and it is presumeable, that any losses to which they
subject the farmer, is more than compensated, in general, by
the number of supernumerary cattle which he is able to rear.
