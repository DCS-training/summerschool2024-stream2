   Prices of Labour.-Day labourers receive, for their labour,
8 d. a day; but are now beginning to ask more.  Carpenters 
are paid from 10 d. to 1 s.; masons, rs.  5 1/2 d.; taylors, 4 d.
or 5 d.  with victuals.  Labourers, who have families, com-
monly rent a small piece of ground, the work upon which
is performed chiefly by their children.  The wages of servants,
hired by the year or half year, have increased greatly within 
there 30 years.  In 1758, a man servant might have been 
hired for 1 L. 16 s. 8 d. a year; at present, 5 L. a year are the 
common wages for men servants who can hold a plough, and 
perform all such farm work as requires the greatest strength
and skill.  Others, whole years and dexterity fit them only
for work of a less robust nature, receive indeed smaller 
wages; but even the weakest and most unskilful man servant, 
cannot be hired for less than 2 L. a year.  For the harvest la-
bour alone, they get from 30 s. to 40 s.  Women servants 
are paid at the rate of 2 L. or 2 L. 10 s. a year.
