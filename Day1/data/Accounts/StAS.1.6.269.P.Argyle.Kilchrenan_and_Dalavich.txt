pence of raising those crops often exceed their value.-Prevail-
ing rains through great part of the year, with a precarious
seed-time and harvest, render the climate of this country un-
friendly to the growth of corn; therefore the chief attention
should be directed to the improvement of our grass and cattle.
-The inhabitants are beginning to keep fewer cattle, and of
course, better grass than formerly.  The gentlemen are par-

   Mr Campbell of Sonachan incloses, dresses, and limes ex-

besides excellent pasture, gives him more hay than a numerous
stock of black-cattle and horses can consume.  Sheep he pays
particular attention to; and has more than once gained the
premium given to this country for the best tups.-Mr Camp-
bell of Kilmartin, who has resided only for a few years in this

incumbent possesses a well inclosed and subdivided farm.  From
the arable land, he takes a rotation of oats, green crops, bear,
and grass-seeds, with lime or compost.  After one crop of
hay, he pastures for several years;- uses Small's plough, with
two horses, without a driver;-keeps 400 breeding ewes of
the short or Linton kind, which he intends crossing this year
with Cheviot-hill tups.

   Woods, Inns, and Roads.-Inclosing, cutting, barking or

day.
