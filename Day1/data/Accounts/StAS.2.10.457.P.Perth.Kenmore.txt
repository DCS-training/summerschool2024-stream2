animals there  enumerated. If you should saunter through the
parks or woods of Taymouth, you might regard yourself as being
within the bounds of a vast menagerie, so considerable is the va-
riety of animals which, you would see.  Besides the different
breeds of sheep to be found in one set of inclosures, and of
cattle in another, you would perceive browsing or bounding here
and there, the red the fallow, and the roe-deer; and besides
having your attention ever and anon attracted by the gambols of
the squirrel, or the whirrings of the pheasant your walk
chance to bring you within sight, or perhaps encounter, of greater
strangers,-the clumsy emu of the Asiatic isles may appear stalk-
ing before you; 'or you may meet the bison, which has come from
the banks of the Missouri to astonish with his grotesque figure;
or you may find yourself in the vicinity of a staring buffalo,or in
the middle of a herd of white Caledonian cattle.  But by much
the most interesting sight is that of the capercailzie, or cock of
the wood, about to be again introduced to the forests of Scotland.
With us, the bird has been a stranger for about seventy years. In
the course of 1837, there were brought to Taymouth twenty-eight
birds of this beautiful species of grouse.  They were given to the
Marquis of Breadalbane by Mr T. Fowel Buxton, late M. P. for
Weymouth, who sent his gamekeeper to Sweden to procure them.
Of these, some are still kept in confinement, while a number have
been allowed to go at large.  The cock appears to be of a bold,
pugnacious spirit; is splendid in mien and plumage; and way be
about 16 lbs. in weight.  The bird must have been pretty com-
mon at one period  in Scotland.*
     Botany.-This parish, like most Highland parishes, presents an
interesting field of observation to the botanist.
     In the low grounds, on the borders of Lochtay, and in the
woods in its immediate neigbbourbood, the lover of plants will
find the following specimens of the less common plants.

      
     Circara alpina                  Rubus saxatilis
     Scirpus sylvaticus              Thalictrum majua
     Bromus asper                    Geranium sanguineum
            giganteus                Vicia sylvatica
     Asperula odorata                Astragalus glyeyphyllus
     Anchusa sempervivens            Hypericum dubium
