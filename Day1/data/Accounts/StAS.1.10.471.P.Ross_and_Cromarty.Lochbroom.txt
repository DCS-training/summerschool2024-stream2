It has been said, however, that these people who are dispos-
sessed of their farms, can live much more comfortably in the
manufacturing employment, than ever they could do before.
But would they not be still more happy, if manufactures were
introduced among themselves*?  And is it not a matter of
importance to the nation to encourage population in the High-
lands, as well as in other parts of the kingdom?  Besides
these inconveniencies, many of the people of Lochbroom are
at a loss for the means of religious instruction, though they
have got a clergyman to the village, and are besides furnish-
ed with three catechists from the committee for the royal
bounty.  In such an extensive parish, there ought to be no
fewer than 4 clergyman, in order to afford the benefit of
Christian worship and public instruction to the whole body of
the people.  In their present state many of them do not hear
so much as one sermon in a year, which is also the case with
different parts of some neighbouring parishes.  In Lochbroom
it is a striking circumstance to see crowds of people coming
for christenings and marriages from a distance of several miles,
both by sea and land, in the time of boisterous and rainy
weather+.

*There was a LINT MANUFACTURING STATION established
here, some time ago, by, the Board of Trustees for fisheries and
manufactures.  While this work continued it was of great ser-
vice to this parish, but it has been long since given up.  The
house, where the superintendant lived, stands at the end of the
Meikle Loch, and could be repaired at a small expence, so as
to be occupied again.

+The clergyman of the village could perform these good
offices, to such of them as are contiguous to him.  But it is a
pity that the minister of the parish should be so fondly tenacious
of his dignity, as to deny this indulgence
