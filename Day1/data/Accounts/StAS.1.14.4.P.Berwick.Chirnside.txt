     Statiscal Account

   The vestige of a cairn, although not now in accumula-
tion, but the raised ground , rather hollowed out in the
middle, is observable on the eastern, and highest summit of
the hill; near to which the row of the village, on that
side, begins.  Idington Hill, which, with a small interval,
is a continuation of the same ridge, shows yet more appa-
rently, the place and remains of two cairns.  The heaped
stones of one of them, were but lately carried off; and, it,
is known, that, in their first demolition, about 40 years
ago, a stone coffin, its figure said to be an oblong square,
was taken up entire, and conveyed to a gentleman's place
in the neighbourhood.  In the track of Lammermuir,
between Chirnside and Dunglass, several of these cairns
were, of late years, very conspicuous, as they are found
most numerous upon the E. coast of Scotland, adjacent to 
that of Northumberland, and of Yorkshire, often invaded 
and occupied by the Danes and Saxons.

   Chirnside Hill, and Prospects from it, etc.-Among the
several eminences which disjoined from the edge of Lam-
mermuir, on the N., project into the Low Country of
Berwickshire, Chirnside Hill is a most remarkable one.  It
is distinguished from others of them, by its elevation and
semicircular aspect to the S. joined with the great ex-
pansion of its summit, and its gradual declination to
Whittadder water.  It commands, as most of them do,
the view of a country, the richest in soil (with the ex-
ception of the Carses) of any in Scotland; and, we
may add, in its present state of culture and fertility,
not inferior to the best improved lands of England; un-
less we take into the account the forced gardens and nur-
series around the metropolis, and some meadows, glutted
with manure, or formed out of swamps in the fenny coun-
