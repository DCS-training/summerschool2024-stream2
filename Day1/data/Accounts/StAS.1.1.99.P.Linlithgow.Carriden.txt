90 years of age.  There are 4 heritors, none of whom reside
in the parish.  The alterations here, and in the neighbour-
hood, with regard to the dress and manner of living of the
people, are very great.

     Villages.-There are 4 villages in the parish; Grangepans,
Bridgeness, Benhardpans, and Blackness.  Most of the ship-
ping that is now in Borrowstounness formerly belonged to
Grangepans: But, since a good pier and harbour was erected
in Borrowstounness, most of the ships lie there.  The trade
along the south side of the Forth is much decayed.  It is
gone to Grangemouth, which is 4 miles up the Frith from
Borrowstounness, and the entry into the great canal.  At
present Borrowstounness has little trade but what arises from
the coal and salt works.

   Wages.-Servants wages are very high here.  A servant
man, who would have been satisfied, 40 years ago, with
L. 1:5:0 half yearly, now gets L. 3 or L. 4 half year-
ly, and sometimes more.  A servant maid, who got 10 or
11 shillings per half year, 40 or 50 years ago, now gets 30,
40, and sometimes 50 shillings in the half year.  A day-la-
bourer gets 1 s. or 1 s. 2 d. a-day, who was formerly hired for
5 d. in winter, and 7 d. in summer, per day.  The price of
provisions has risen in proportion.

   Stipend.-The stipend is precisely 8 chalders of victual, or
L. 800 Scots.  The glebe is 5 Scots acres, valued at 30 shil-
lings per acre.  The Duke of Hamilton is patron.  This living
would have supported a family 50 years ago better than
L. 120 Sterling could do here now.
