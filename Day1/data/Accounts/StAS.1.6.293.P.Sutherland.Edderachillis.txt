to anchor below the house of the eldest of the brothers upon the main land,
who in this way getting his rival within his power, had him immediately put
to death by hanging him up, thinking no more was necessary to his suc-
ceeding to the possession of the estate of Lewis.  But the death of the fa-
vourite young man so irritated the whole clan of M'Leod, that they re-
solved nothing except the death of the judge should stone for it, and this
Little Fohn M'Dhoil mhich Huiscdan, being universally reputed the fittest per-
son for this enterprize, it was committed to him accordingly.  The judge,
informed of his danger, thought fit to come and wait on the master of Reays
who then lived in Diurness, about the Christmas holidays, in order to prevail
with him, to protect him, and to threaten John M'Leod from attempting
any thing against him.  But John M'Leod being told of the judge's having
left his boat at Inverchirkak in Assint, waited for him there is his return,
flew both him and his brother; and after this went to Lewis and married
the judge's widow.-On account of the barbarity and cruelty of these
M'Leods at this time, and their murder of a very promising youth who
was the rightful heir of the estate of Lewis, immediately upon his coming
home to his estate from Ediburgh, where he had his education under the
King's eye, and this murder of judge Morison, of whose integrity his ma-
jesty had a high opinion, the king disposed of Lewis to a company of ad-
ventures from Fife and Dundee, whose history is well known.
Among the numerous islands on this coast is one called Elan a Bhrin, or,
the Island of the Judge, from the above mentioned Judge Morison.  After
he had been slain, his friends in Lewis came in a galley to bring home his
corpse; but contrary winds arising drove them with the body on board to
this island, where they found it convenient, after taking his bowels out, to
buty them; and the wind soon after changing, they arrived in safety at
home.  This small island, which furnishes good pasture for lambs, being
about 4 acres of extent, is possessed by the present minister of Edderachy-
lis, as it has been by all his predecessors in office by the gift of the family
of Reay.
All thse islands, and many more, some of them inhabited, and others af-
fording excellent pasture, and of considerable extent, from Roe a Stoir in
Assint to Stroma in Orkney, are said to have been granted in property, and
included in a charter to one Ferchard Beton, a native of Isla, and a famous
