	The greater part of the population are, more or less, con-
nected with agriculture.

			IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The total number of acres in the parish is 5440,
which may be thus divided: arable, 3103 acres; p`sture, 1539
acres; wood, 491; road, houses, water, gravel, &c. 307. There
are only a few acres of waste land remaining, to the reclaiming of
which capital could be profitably applied; while much has been
brought into cultivation that scarcely repays the expense of tillage.
There are many farms, however, where tile-draining would be of
the greatest advantage.  In a few instances, it has been adopted;
but want of capital, and the low price of grain and cattle for some
years past, must prevent its being carried so far as would be de-
sirable. The proprietors would require to take the matter into
their own hands. The number of farms at present is fifteen, vary-
ing in extent from 60 to 400 acres: also five or six crofts, none
of them exceeding 8 acres. The average rent of land is about
L.1, which, in the present times, is much to high. Average rent
of grazing for an ox, about L.2, 10s; the keep of the milch cow
throughout the year, about L.6.
	The system of husbandary pursued is, in general, rather superior
The paln of cropping varies from a four to a seven-course shift.
according to the terms of the lease and the quality of the soil.
The five-shift seems to be the favourite, viz. one grain crop, tur-
nips and potatoes, barley or oats, hay or pasture, and one year
pasture. Bone-dust has of late been much used here for raising
ttrnips; and Guano and other newly-introduced manures are com-
ing into vogue. Liming seems to have been first had recourse to
soon after the last Statistical Account was published, when it was
carried to by far too great an extent.
