a good deal of broom, interpersed with patches of short
grass, affording good pasture for your black cattle.  On
the most easterly within this parish, is a beautiful plantation
of firs, containing not less than 150 acres.  The summit of
the highest, called Craig Owl, is found, by actual measure-
ment, to be 1100 feet above the plain;  but the plain itself
is full 500 feet above the level of the sea.  There is some
grey slate, a good deal of moor-stone, and plenty of free-
stone.  The last, however, lies rather deep, and is some-
what difficult to be got at.

   The cultivated part of the parish forms a plain gently
declining towards the S.;  of a soil light and gravelly towards
the hill, rather sitter for pasture than tillage, black, deep
and rich, sometimes including to clay in the middle;  in the
southern parts rather marshy, and mostly used as pasture,
or natural meadow.  The great fault of the foil in general
is an excess of moisture, owing partly to the vicinity of
the hill, but chiefly to a straturn of clay, or rather clay and
gravel, which runs immediately under the whole of it.
The air is rather moist and cold, yet not, upon the whole,
unhealthful.  Sickly people from other quarters, sometimes
find a summer's residence in it beneficial.  The rheuma-
tism is only distemper remarkably prevalent.  It may
in part be owing to the nature of the air;  but more pro-
bably to the damp earthen floors, and insufficient doors
and windows of the greater part of the houses.

   Population.-The population of this parish, according to
the return made to Dr Webster, amounted to 735 souls.
At present the number of souls is 802;  of families 158,
persons to a family, 5.  The people live all of them in
single houses, or in hamlets.  The increase in the popula-
tion is to be ascribed to the erection of some new farms.
Several young people every year move to the fourthward,
