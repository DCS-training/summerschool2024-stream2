Inn at the east, to a rivulet called Aultnalait, near Tulloch,
at the west.  The breadth is various.  That part of the pa-
rish which is well cultivated is about two miles broad, from
the sea-shore on the south, to the foot of the hilly ground on
the north.  But there are several grazings and Highland pos-
sessions at the distance of five, ten, and even fifteen miles,
from the sea.  It is bounded by the parish of Alnes on the
east, by Contin and Lochbroom on the north, by Dingwall
and Fodderty on the west, and by Cromarty Bay on the south.
The Highland district of this parish is, for the most part,
wild and uncultivated, consisting of high mountains, separat-
ed from each other by rapid rivulets, and extensive tracts of
moors and moffy ground.  In this district, there is consi-
derable strath*, called the Clare, pleasantly situated in an in-
clined plain, upon the banks of the river Skiack, containing
about 200 acres arable land and meadow ground.  And, on
the opposite side of the river, there is also a plain of about 30
acres, called Bognahavin.  Though the houses in this remote
district are in general very mean, yet there is one on each side
of the river built in a style superior to the generality of
farm-houses in the parish, being the goat-whey quarters of
the minister of Kiltearn, and of Mr Munro sheriff-substitute
of Lewis.  In either of these houses, the weary traveller, or
the fatigued sportsman, can find comfortable accommoda-
tions.  This circumstance is only taken notice of, because it is a
perfect contract to the miserable huts, called Shealings, which
the hardy Highlanders inhabit while they tend their flocks
and herds, and live on the produce of the dairy.

   If we turn our eyes to the low district of the parish, which
inclines gently from the foot of the hills towards the sea, a
