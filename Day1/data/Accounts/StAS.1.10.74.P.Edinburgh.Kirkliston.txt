of Newliston in this parish, where he resided for 20 years
subsequent to his recall from his embassy at Paris in 1720,
and seems to have bestowed much attention on his maternal
inheritance.  The pleasure grounds, nearly three miles in cir-

on the south-east face, deeply cut in the stone, in a most un-
south manner:
