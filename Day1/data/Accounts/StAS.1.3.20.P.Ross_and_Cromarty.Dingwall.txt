     Statistical Account

the parish produces is fold to distillers, and many of the
cattle are purchased by drovers.  The Dingwall butchers are
therefore often obliged to go to a distance for cattle, sheep,
etc. and the mechanics furnish themselves with  their sum-
mer meal from other parts of the country.  It is difficult to
draw the balance between those exports and imports; but, on
the whole, it is probably in favour of the parish.
   Near the church an obelisk stands, which, though of no
great antiquity, attracts the notice of all travellers.  It is
erected on an artificial mount, the  bottom  of which covers
about  two-thirds of an English acre.  The obelisk is six feet
square at the base, and rises in a pyramidal form to the
height of 57 feet.  It was erected by George first Earl of
Cromarty, secretary of state for Scotland in the reign of
Queen Anne, and was intended to ornament and distinguish
this spot, which  he designed to be the family burying-place.
