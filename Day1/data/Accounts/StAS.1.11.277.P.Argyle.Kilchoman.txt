mous for grazing, runs through the parish.

   Soil, Produce, Exports, etc.-The ground all around the
coast is arable, producing corn and barley, flax and potatoes.
The soil is of different qualities; moss, clay, loam, and land;
but no other crops are raised, owing to the open state of the
country.  Shell, sand, and sea-weed are made use of for ma-

to give good crops, and to mend the grass: When mixed
with moss, they prove an excellent compost.  Large fields of
potatoes are annually raised by it, which is very fortunate
for the poorer sort of people, who can get no other manure,
and who live upon potatoes and fish for three fourths of the
year.  The rearing barley and flax is much practised by the
common tenantry, who by these make up the greater part of
their rent, yarn being one of our principal exports.  The

   Cultivation, etc.-Of late, the farmers have got into the
way of sowing early oats, which gives them an earlier har-

and rains, that set in from the W. early in autumn.  Seed-
time commences about the 22 d of March; and by the middle
of October all the crop is generally got in.  The broad
Scotch plough, with 4 horses, is most generally in use.  There
are several tacksmen in the parish, who employ cottagers to
work their farms, and tend their dairy.  This must be the
case with gentlemen who have large farms, as it would be
impossible to take servants into their houses to carry on all
their business; and as there may be some of them, whose
