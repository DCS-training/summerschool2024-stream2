     of Kirkwall and St Ola.

still legible, it appears to have been built in 1607, and indi-
cates much vanity in the founder; for there are engraven
on stones, on many parts of its the capital letters P, E, O,
the initials of his name and dignity.  This Palace has walls
remarkably well built, though only of grey stone.  They are
at present as straight as if they had been erected only 20
years ago; and there are on several parts of the building,
particularly on the corners, projections of hewn stone, in the
form of turrets, but, in fact, balcony windows.  One very
spacious and elegant hall is the chief part of the mansion:
Its dimensions are 58 feet long, 20 broad, and 14 high-
There is a very large chimney on the side, and a lesser one
on the north end of it.  A fine Gothic window, 12 feet by
13, lights it from the south; and, on the east, there are no
fewer than two, not much different in form, and 12 feet by
12 each of them.  The building, though considerably long,
consists of only two storeys, which renders it less pleasant to
the eye, and gives it rather a mean appearance.  The ground-
floor is divided into a great many vaults or cells, with little
slits of windows; and this circumstance must have them made
not only dark, but damp; and, of consequence, if ever they
were inhabited, very inconvenient and disagreeable habita-
tions.  Near the door, which is entered from the north, is
the bottom of a beautiful stair, which, by three slights of
steps, leads to the hall; below which is a well built of cut
free stone, and furnished with water by leaden pipes under
ground, from the high land to the ear of Kirkwall.  Like
other fabrics reared at the same period, variety seems to have
been more studied here than uniformity.  For a long time
past, it has been unroofed; and no person has dwelt in it
since Dr M'Kenzie was Bishop of this place, who died in
1688.
