tivation.  The high moorish parts of the parish are chiefly
applied to rearing and pasturing sheep, and some are kept
through the whole.  The number is about 7000.  Those of
the moors are generally black faced and black legged-have
very rough coarse wool, and are always smeared with tar.
They are of a little size, but hardy and well boned, and feed
to a considerable weight when put upon rich pasture.  Some
of mixed breeds, of larger body, and finer wool, are kept on
the lower grounds.  The number of cows kept are about
1600, besides young ones which the farmers are always rear-
ing; of which there cannot be less than 400 bred annually.
The district contains 130 ploughgates; and no great refine-
ment in agriculture being yet introduced, 4 horses are for
the most part yoked to each plough, so that the number of
horses are about 520, besides young ones annually reared,
probably about 100.  The horses in this part of the country
were formerly of a small size, and ill shaped; but of late the
breed is much improved, and horses of a considerable value
are now reared here.  There are also 12 horses kept by car-
riers in and round the village, who carry goods to and from
different places.  The people of this part of Scotland had
formerly a superstitious prejudice against swine; but now
there are a number reared and fed in this parish.  It does
not appear, however, to be a very advantageous kind of eco-
nomy to feed hogs in a barren country, where every thing
the land produces can generally be otherways consumed to
greater advantage.  It can only be beneficial for farmers who
keep no more hogs than they can support, on such of the
offals of their dairy as they can turn to no other purpose,
and feed them up in the autumn with potatoes.  Of those
animals there may be about 70 or 80 killed in this parish an-
nually.
