        Manufatures.-At the village of Bladenoch, about a mile from
the town, there is a distillery, which consumes yearly about 16,000
bushels of barley, in the manufacture of whisky. About 20 la-
bourers are employed in it, exclusive of tradesmen.
        Navigation.-The harbour is within a quarter of a mile of the
town. The harbour dues are let by the magistrates for L. 26 per
annum, which is expended in defraying the expenses of building
and repairing the same. There were about fourteen vessels be-
longing to Wigton, containing about 883 tons burden, for the year
ending January 1, 1832. There were seventy-six vessels outward
bound, the amount of their cargods 5017 tons, and ninety vessels
inward, amounting to 6220 tons. The quantity of grain shipped,
from 29th September 1829 until 29th September 1830, was 1453
bolls of 12 bushels each, 60 bolls of potatoes, 120 bolls outmeal.
From September 29, 1830 to September 29, 1831, 780 bolls
grain, 12 buschels to the boll.
	A steam-boat plies betwixt this and Whitehaven, and between
this and Liverpool once a fortnight, during the year.

                V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	The town of Wigton has undergone great improvements within
the last twenty years. Many new houses have been built, and a
large space of an oblong figure, in the middle of the principal street,
which is unusually wide, has been enclosed, and planted with
shrubs, evergreens, and forest trees. There are spacious gragel
walks in it, and a bowling-green in the centre. The Parliamentary
constituency amounts to 107. The corporation revenue is about
L. 350 per annum. The number of inhabited houses in the town
is 403.
        Ecclesiastical State.-The first chuch is Wigton was conse-
crated to St Machute, an obscure saint, who died in 554. It ori-
