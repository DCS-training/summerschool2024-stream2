                MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	In the present depressed state of agriculture, the farmers hav-
ing great difficulty in paying their rents, thd Earl of Aboyne, at
the last collection, being for crop and year 1833, was pleased to
accept of the rents according to the fiars prices of the grain, by
which means the tenantry received a reduction in their money
rents of twenty per cent.
	At the time of the last Statistical Account, much of the land
in the parish was in a state of waste,-the appearance of the coun-
try was bare and bleak,-the climate cold and damp, owing to the
quantity of surface water on the land. Most of the houses in
the parish were at that time of the rudest and the meanest kind,
built of unhewn stone, and covered with thatch, scarcely one of
mason work, or covered with slates. Now the farms are all laid out
and enclosed,-draining is carried to great perfection,-and farm-
houses and steadings are neatly and substantially built and co-
vered. Thriving woods and belts of plantations are rising up,
and giving a rich and clothed appearance to the country. Along
with all this, it is gratifying to observe, that the habits of the peo-
ple are improving. There is now a greater neatness and clean-
liness in their dwellings, and a greater share of the comforts of life,
amongst them; and, though last, not least, there is evidently an
increasing desire of information, and, generally speaking, a higher
and better tone of moral feeling.

	February 1835.
