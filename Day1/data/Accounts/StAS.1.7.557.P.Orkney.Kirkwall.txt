feet diameter.  They have been built at some very remote
period with very large stones, without any sort of cement,
contracted gradually from the base, as it would appear, to the
top, which was perhaps closed in the form of a cone, to cover
the whole building.  Curiosity has looked into some; ava-
rice has searched others of them; and, when a few of them
have been dug, for the purpose of procuring stones to build
with, a great many bones have been found in them, some of
them human, and some of them the bones of other animals.
For what important purposes such huge piles as these were
at first erected, and to what uses they have been afterwards
applied, cannot now with much certainty be determined.
   Near the house of Caldale, some tumuli have been opened,
in which stones, placed in the form of square urns, have
been found, containing human bones, partly consumed with
fire, intermixed with a considerable quantity of ashes.  Seve-
ral other parts of the parish contain tumuli of a similar kind,
which, were they opened, might perhaps exhibit contents
also similar.  In most places where they are to be found, we
meet with several of them, placed almost close by each other;
and, in one place, about two miles distant from Kirkwall, to
the south-east, not far from the Bay of Scalpa, and near the
post road to Holm, there are five of them, so arranged as to
form somewhat of the appearance of a circle; and this has
been conjectured by some to be the Circle of Loda, mention-
ed in the Poems of Ossian.

   Roads.-The state of the roads is very indifferent at present.
They were made about 30 years ago, through the exertions of
the gentlemen of the place, partly by contribution, partly by
road-money, and partly by statute labour.  One of these roads
leads to the excellent and much frequented harbour of Deer.
