	There are two stone cairns, about a mile apart, on the farms of
Letterbeg and Ardlair. Their form is circular, about 300 feet in
circumference, and 30 in height. The stones of which they are
composed are nearly round, and all about the size which a strong
man could carry. Similar to these, and seen from them, are cairns
on Crossdardar to the west, in parish of Birse, and Cairnmount-
earn to the east, in parish of Durris, and the line may have been
intended, in ancient times, for beacon fires to intimate to the in-
habitants an enemy's approach, and summon them to defence or
retreat.
			III.--POPULATION.
	The population, when last Statistical Account was written in
1792, amounted to 700. It had increased to 1039 in 1831.
Since, it has decreased, and, according to a careful census made
in 1838, it amounted to 942. The census of 1841 gives 944.
The recent decrease is accounted for by the emigration of families,
--the decay of old houses which have not been rebuilt,--and prin-
cipally by the union of several small farms into one, which system
is now generally practised as the leases expire. The whole popula-
tion is agricultural and pastoral. There is no village in the parish.
