do not reside here, but are frequently to be seen, and are
often caught with bait.  There is a great variety of other
sea-fowl, which are common on the east coast.  Great num-
bers of wild-duck, are to be found in the parish; muirfowl
are to be got in the moors; partridges, snipes, and plovers
are in great plenty; the smaller birds, which are to be
found in neighbouring parishes, are numerous.  The cuc-
koo and corn-rail generally appear in the months of April
and May, and are seldom heard after the month of August.
The lapwing generally arrives in February or March, and
leaves this country in the end of autumn; lapwings of late
have been observed to reside in this part of the country all
winter; the woodcock makes his appearance about the

days become very fat; there can, be little doubt of their
coming from Norway and the east country; they are ge-
nerally observed first on the east coast.  If there be any
doubts of their coming from the east country, they may be
removed by a fact, of which I was informed by a gentle-
man of veracity.  About 50 years ago, he was in company
with one of the proprietors of the loch of Strathbeg, about
10 miles north of this place, in the parish of Lonmay,
which at that time was intended to be drained, and which
they had been surveying.  In the evening, after sunset, be-
fore it was quite dark, he heard a great noise, like the flut-
tering of a flock of birds, and law something like a cloud
before him; on examining more particularly, he found a
very large flock of woodcocks perfectly exhausted, and not
able to stir from the place where they had settled; they
were likewise entirely emaciated.
   A few weeks ago, during the severest part of the win-
ter, (1795), I observed a strange bird, which I had never
seen here before; it was about the size of a corn-rail, bad
a long bill, with long legs, some red spots on its head, the
