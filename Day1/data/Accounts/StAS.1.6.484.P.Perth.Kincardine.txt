for whose benefit it was erected, and partly of collections made
in five synods by the authority of the General Assembly 1730.
This fund is under the management of the presbytery of
Dunblane, who are subject to the controul of the General As-
sembly.  Part of the money was applied to purchase lands in
the neighbourhood, and a part of these, rented formerly at
L. 8:6:8 is appropriated for a glebe, and a house was built
upon it in 1774.  The present stipend is L. 30 sterling and 40
bolls of meal or bear.-The King has presented the present
minister of the parish and his two immediate predecessors; but
the patronage is supposed to be in the number of those given
to Mr Drummond, the representative of the family of Perth,
by the late act of Parliament for restoring the forfeited estates.
By an act of the ministers and heritors of those parishes,
from which the congregation at the chapel is formed, dated
1750, confirmed by the presbytery of Dunblane and the Ge-
neral Assembly, the chaplain at Norriestown was declared to
be assistant to the minister of Kincardine, who has also the
power of nomination to the office given him, which was exer-
cised until 1771.  The General Assembly of that year, upon
a petition of the congregation, allowed the vacancy, that had
then taken place, to be supplied by the majority of the exam-
inable persons.  The last vacancy was supplied in the same
manner, with the consent of the minister of Kincardine.
   About a third of the parishioners are separatists of different
denominations; the Burgher Seceders are the most numerous
class; it prevails much on the S. E. point of the parish, that
being in the neighbourhood of Stirling, where that sect have
had their most numerous congregation; Ebenezer Erskine
being one of the ministers of that town at the commencement
of the Secession.-The Antiburgher Seceders, and adher-
ents of the Presbytery of Relief are next to them in number.
