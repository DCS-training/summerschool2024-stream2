   The mean population may be nearly had by multiplying
the average of births by 31 1/3; or the average of deaths by
54; or the average of marriages by 64 1/3; or the average of a
family by the number of families.  The mean or average po-
pulation, for any time, is the real population increased or di-
minished by half the decrease or increase in that time:  Thus,
the real population 1759, diminished by 58, half the increase
is 1701.  But this can only be true on the supposition that
the increase or decrease is uniform.  The true mean popula-
tion must be deduced from the following Table, which pos-
sesses many more important uses than merely determining the
population.
