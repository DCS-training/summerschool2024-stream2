son of Cranston, containing a grant of the lands of Traquair,
etc. dated at Edinburgh, anno 1409, it is spelt Traquar.

   Extent, Situation, Surface, etc.-The greatest length of the
parish is along the southern bank of the Tweed, which lies in
the direction from E. to W. between 8 and 9 miles.  From
the Tweed to the source of Quair is from 4 to 5 miles, which
is its greatest breadth in the direction from N.E. to S.W.
It contains, according to Armstrong, who made a survey of
the county about 16 years ago, 17,290 acres, about 4000 of
which are arable.  The figure is very irregular, being fre-
quently intersected by the parish of Yarrow.  It is bounded
on the N. by the Tweed.  The general appearance of the pa-
rish is hilly, rocky, and mountainous.  Minchmoor, over
which the old road to Selkirk passes, is more than 2000 feet
above the sea, and Gumseleugh, and some other heights in the
parish are at least 200 feet above Minchmoor.  The hills, in
general, afford excellent pasture for sheep.  The soil on the
low grounds, though in general shallow and stony, is fertile;
and on Tweed haughs there is a considerable depth of loam
deposited by the river in the course of ages.  The south sides
of the hills are generally green, while their northern exposure
is heathy, and of a darker complexion.  There are no volca-
nic appearances in any part of the parish, though many of the
neighbouring mountains, according to some theories, may be
thought to support such an opinion, as they are piked or co-
nical.  The common whin rock, a finer kind approaching to the
basaltes, a corse sort of granite, and a considerable quantity
of slate are the only kind of stones found in the parish.  The
slate was formerly wrought in considerable quantity, but they
have of late rather dug at the top, than opened the quarry
properly, and on that account the slates are found not to bear
exposure to the air without shivering.  The noble family of
