this circumstance must make the husbandman and grazier
bid adieu to all regular calculation.
   At a moderate calculation, there may be 2600 head of
black cattle in the parish.  It is impossible to say exactly
what number is annually sold, as the sales must depend upon
a number of contingent circumstances.  The breed of hor-
ses is small, and entirely used for the different purposes of
agriculture, the number may be 250 or thereabout.  As to
sheep, the number in the parish is so few, that it is hardly
worth the calculating.  Such as can afford to eat mutton are
obliged to purchase from the neighbouring sheep walks.

   Population.-In the year 1755, the number of souls in
the parish was 1250; and now, notwithstanding emigra-
tions, and repeated drains to the army, the inhabitants a-
mount to 1788.  The proportion of males to females is as
5 to 6; the number of deaths for years back is from 18 to
28; marriages from 9 to 14; births at an average 40.
There are now eight men in the parish upwards of 80; of
women above that age, five; of that number, one is 98,
and another 95.

   Antiquities.-There are two castles in this parish tole-
rably conspicuous; 1st, Dunskaich, built upon a rock, on
the west side of Sleat; the communication betwixt this
rock and the opposite side was kept up by a draw-bridge,
but from the appearance of the mason-work on that side of
the castle, the arch seems to be modern; the building on
the west side has every appearance of antiquity, part being
circular, and covered from top to bottom with ivy.  There
has been a prison and draw-well; all this seems to infer,
that the edifice was reared at different times, and perhaps
in different ages; he must be an ill-informed reader that
