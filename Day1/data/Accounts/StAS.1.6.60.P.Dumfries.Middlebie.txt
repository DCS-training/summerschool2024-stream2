     Statistical Account

sists of a manse, a glebe of 12 acres, 5 chalders of victual,
L. 66: 13: 4 in money, and L. 5 for communion elements,
so that it is altogether worth L. 150 per annum.  The Duke of
Queensberry is patron.  The amount of the collections at the
church-door, fines, etc. is about L. 17; which, added to L. 5,
the interest of a legacy, makes the whole annual income of
the poor L. 22.-There has been no school here for 40 years
past; but the legal steps for having a salary fixed on a school-
master will be soon taken.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-A woman died some years ago
at the age of 109.-The principal disadvantages are the scar-
city of fuel, and the wetness of the soil.  Some of the heritors
are making trials for coal, of which there is a favourable ap-
pearance.  The fuel commonly used is peat and turf; some
coals are brought from Canonbie.-Near the church are the
vestiges of a Roman work, some account of which may be seen
in Pennant's tour; and several coins have been found here.
-The people in general seem to be economical, and con-
tented with their situation, though it cannot be said that they
enjoy in a great degree the comforts and advantages of socie-
ty: there are many means by which their condition might be
meliorated.-The roads were originally made find kept in
repair by statute labour, which is now commuted.  The turn-
pike road from Glasgow to Carlisle passes through the parish,
in which is a toll-bar, lately let at L. 116 per annum.-
These are some small tippling ale, or rather whisky, houses, in
this district, most hurtful to the industry, health, and morals
of the people.
