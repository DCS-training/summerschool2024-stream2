     Statistical Account

ris.  Standing on this eminence, at lowest ebb in spring tides,
and in calm weather, one contemplates with amazement the
vast variety of islands, rocks, banks, fhoals, and streights, before
him, compares them to the stars in the galaxy, and is almost
bewildered in the view.  'Credas innare revulsas Cycladas '
Here the tide rises to a great height; the current runs with
amazing rapidity; the surge, when the wind blows against
the tide, swells prodigiously; and the roar of the breakers,
foaming over the banks and shoals to an immense distance,
seems to threaten the islanders with a general deluge.  In
winter storms, the view is tremenduous and grand beyond
the power of description.  One would hardly expect to find
a safe course of navigation through such a Sound; yet the
writer hereof recollects to have counted in one day upwards
of sixty sail of herring busses, which found their way through
it without an accident, bound northward to the Loch-Rogue
fishing.  He has even seen some ships of burden, which were
driven in by stormy weather from the Western Ocean, pilot-
ed in safety, by the people of the islands, through this seem-
ingly impervious course.

     2. Description of the Mainland of Harris within Tarbert.

   This track of country extends from the Sound to Tarbert,
a length of 15 miles.  At the southern extremity, its breadth
is about 6 miles: It narrows gradually, but irregularly, towards
the middle of this region; and from thence widens again to-
wards the ridge of mountains that overhangs Tarbert, where,
computing from the head lands on the W. coast to those on
the E. the breadth may be about 8 miles.  The whole of
this district is mountainous and rocky, excepting the W.
coast, which is mostly bordered with a stripe of plain ground,
and covered with verdure almost to the tops of the hills.
