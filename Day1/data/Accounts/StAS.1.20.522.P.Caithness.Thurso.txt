carried on a profitable connection with the county of Caith-

war, to curtail the number of their branches, withdrew

as agent for the Aberdeen Commercial Bank, and it now

and improvement of the northern parts of Scotland.

from 150 to 200 barrels of salmon in a season; and it is a
fact well attested, that in the year 1736, 2560 salmon were
taken in the course of a day, upon one pool on the river of
Thurfo.  The salmon-fishing at Thurfo commences in No-

and carried on board smacks to London, where the sell for
a high price.  Twelve hundred kitts have been sent from
the river Thurfo in a season, and the general average is
