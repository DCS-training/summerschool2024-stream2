     The Statistical Account.

   For several years the fishery has been very bad, and the
number of hands fewer than by the former return.  The
fishermen, during the summer, frequently take voyages to
Greenland and the Baltic, in coasting vessels, etc.  Trades-
men and day-labourers assist in manning the boats, when em-
ployed in the herring fishery; and a good many of our sea-
men, who are occasionally fishermen, are now in the navy.
   Little kelp is made in the parish; the value not known;
but the rent paid for liberty to make it is from 12 l. to 20 l.
once in two or three years.
   Two midwives; no surgeon.  Little inoculation.  In 1797,
twenty children died in the natural small pox.
