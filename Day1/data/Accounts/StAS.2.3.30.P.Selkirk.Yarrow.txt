Stow; on the E. by Selkirk and Ashkirk; on the S. by Roberton
and Ettrick; and on the W. by Meggat, Manor, and Peebles.
  Topographical apperances.--This high tract, approximating the
great central range, embraces in part three principal mountain
chains.  Their general direction is from W. S. W. to E. N. E. As
the Ettrick and Yarrow run nearly paralled in their course, the se-
condary valleys are small; but where the Yarrov and Tweed diverge,
the country is drained by longer and larger streams.  Excepting a
considerable table-land to the south, the hills are generally ridge-
shaped and rounded on the tops, having accelivities of from 10/d to 3O/d.
There are two features charateristic of the whole.  The valleys are
so formed, that a projecting ridge on one side finds a corresponding
recess in the other.  In these lateral branches, too, the W. and
S. W. sides are always steeper and barer than the opposite, insomuch
that the fundamental strata of rocks are often prominent, or the
surface is covered stones, from which the soil is entirely wash-
ed away.  Our forefathers easilv accounted for this general ap-
pearance, by supporting that the sweep  of the deluge came from
the S. W., a point of the compass whence the greater part of our
wind and rain was still seen to proceed.  We subjoin from Ains-
lie's map a table of different elevations above sea level, but the
accuracy of his estimates has been doubted.  Blackhouse Heights,
2370 feet; Minchmoor, 2280; Hangingshaw Law, 1980; Shaws
Hill, 1212 ; Yarrow Lochs, 560; Deuchar Bridge, 458; and
character, is not unfrequently picturesque.
  Meteorology.--As the welfare of the flocks, and the successful
labours of the field depend much on the condition of the atmo-
sphere, we shall now state such facts regarding it in this district as
have come to our knowledge.  The following is an average of six
years, from 1826 to 1831, accordiiig to a diary of the weather kept
by Mr Ballantyne at Tinnis, about 470 feet above the sea.  Ba-
rometer and thermometer at 8 A.M. and 10 P.M.
