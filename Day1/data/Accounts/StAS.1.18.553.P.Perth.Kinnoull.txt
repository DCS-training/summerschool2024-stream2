   Mr Ninian Drummond, about 1610, was translated from
some other parish, and admitted minister of Kinnoul.  He
was grandson of the first Lord Drummond, and 5th son of
Henry Drummond of Riccarton.  His two immediately elder
brothers were Papists, and, enjoying offices under the Pope,
resided in foreign parts.  His wife was Margaret Crighton,
daughter to the laird of Lugtown.  His second son, Mr Ed-
ward Drummond, having been for some years with his Popish
relations in Avignon, and in Rome, was prevailed upon to
profess the Popish religion.  But he returned to his own
country in 1628, and in the year thereafter renounced the
errors of Popery, and became a Protestant minister.  Mr
Ninian Drummond, was greatly respected in the church.
He wrote concerning the antiquities of the house of Drum-
mond, and his book was of use to the Lord Viscount Strath-
allan, when he wrote his history of the Drummonds.  He
died at Kinnoul, April 1635, having arrived at a very old
age.
   Mr Thomas Halyburton, descended from a family in An-

He accompanied the Earl of Kinnoul's children to London in

sence.  He was translated to the church of Errol, February
1640, and died minister of Errol, January 1649.

Andrews*.  He resided much in the family of the Earl of

constantly in his own parish.  He was sometimes under pro-
