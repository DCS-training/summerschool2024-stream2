point, where vessels from 80 to 100 tons burden may load
and unload, and anchor with the greatest safety, as there are
no dangerous rocks or shelves near the shore.  Excellent free-
stone quarries, that are easily wrought, are to be met in e-
very corner of the parish.  This circumstance, added to the
abundance of timber, affords great encouragement to carry
on buildings, and other improvements.  The advantages of
education which are to be had at the public schools here, is
a very encouraging circumstance to determine such as have
rising families to settle among us.  The prevailing taste for
buildings and improvements among the gentlemen of the pa-

was partricularly experienced in the hard years 1782 and
1783; being, under God, the mean of preserving many fa-

men's improvements will soon be completed, many hands

should be introduced to employ the females, and children of
both sexes; for it is a hard case, when a labouring man is
unable to work  by age or sickness, that his family has no
means of earning a subsistence, however unwilling to work.
This leads us to mention another disadvantage which the poor
women labour under here, which is, that they seldom have
proper assistance when in child-bed, as there is no regularly

require the most tender care, as well as skill.  It is also
much to be wished that the inhabitants in general were better

country, perhaps, are the gentlemen better lodged, and the
