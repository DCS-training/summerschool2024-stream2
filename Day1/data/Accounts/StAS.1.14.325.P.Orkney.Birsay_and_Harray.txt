are mostly old men, or those in the very outskirts of the
parish.
   Most of the people of the barony and Marwick are
bred fishermen; and multitudes of our young men go to
sea, both in merchant and in his Majesty's service; few
in proportion of whom ever return to settle here.  In
this parish, 18 fishing boats run from 4 different sum-
mer stations, besides 2 samll ones used occasionally.
These boats are from 16 to 17 1/2 feet of keel; and, with

roy breeches; some few wear cotton or thread stockings;
shoes much the same as formerly; buckles universal.  The
living, in general, among the lower people and servants, is
much better, owing to the rise of prices of what they can
dispose of, and perhaps by making a more liberal use of
