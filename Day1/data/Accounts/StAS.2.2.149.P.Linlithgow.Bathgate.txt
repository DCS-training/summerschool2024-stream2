               PARISH OF BATHGATE.

PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.

        THE REV. SAMUEL MARTIN, MINISTER.


          I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-In a grant by Malcolm IV. to the monks of Holyrood,
this parish is named Batket.  In other charters and deeds of the
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, the name is written
Bathket, Batket, Bathcat, and Bathkat. The etymology the
writer is unable to explain. The modern name is a manifest cor-
ruption of the original appellation.
   Extent, Boundaries and Figure.-The greatest length of this
parish, which is in a line running nearly from west-south-west to
east-northeast, is 7 1/2 miles; its greatest breadth at right angles to
its length, is 4 miles. It contains 17.53 square miles: 8921.72
Scotch, or 11214.6 imperial acres. *

<FOOTNOTE> Any one who takes the trouble to compute them, will find that these statements
are not exactly, though very nearly, equivalent. They are taken from Forrest's large
map of Linlithgowshire, and the writer believes them all to be beyond the truth.
