in 1767.  It was dedicated to St Peter, as was also the old
parish-church of Stromness, now ruinous.  The minister
preaches at each of the two parish-churches alternately.
   The right of presentation, formerly in the bishop, passed
to the Crown, upon the abolition of Episcopacy, along with
the bishoprick lands; and is now vested in, and exercised
by the Right Honourable Lord Dundas of Aske, who
holds the bishoprick lands in lease from the Exchequer.
   The stipend, by decreet of the Court of Session in 1753,
is 96 meels of malt, L. 15 money, (in lieu of 6 barrels
butter), L. 10 money, (in lieu of vicarages), and L. 3, 6 s.
8 d. for communion-elements.  It is troublesome to collect
this stipend, as it is paid by nearly 100 heritors.  When
it is regularly paid, and malt sells at 10 s. per meel, it is
worth L. 76:  6:  8, including the money allowed for com-
munion-elements.  The village of Stromness pays no part
of stipend, although the population of that village is not
far short of that of both the country parishes.
   There is a glebe in each of these parishes, and both may
be worth about L. 9 Sterling yearly rent.  The minister
of these parishes formerly resided in the parish of Sandwick
until the year 1780, when a new manse was built in the
parish of Stromness, about a mile from the village.
