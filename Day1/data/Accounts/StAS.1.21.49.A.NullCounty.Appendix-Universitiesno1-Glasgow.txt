the use of the members of the University, and some part of
it for exercise to the younger classes of students.

     VII. CONCLUSION.

   Upon the whole, this University, after experiencing ma-
ny revolutions and turns of fortune, has, by favourable con-
junctures, and by the bounty of the sovereign and of the pub-
lic, been raised to prosperous circumstances; and has, as an
academical foundation, become possessed of some conspicuous
advantages:-Its local situation, in the neighbourhood of an
industrious city, and at some distance from the capital; by
which it is not exposed to the dissipation arising from a num-
bet of amusements; nor too remote from the topics of specu-
lation suggested by the progress of philosophy, and the inte-
resting business of society:-The state of its revenue, sufficient,
with economy, in the management of the society, to promote
useful improvements; but not so large as to be productive of
idleness, and the luxury of learned indolence:-Its institutions
and government, by which no sort of monopoly is created in fa-
vour of particular sects, or particular branches of science; but
persons of all persuasions are at liberty to follow that course of
study, which they find suited to their various pursuits and pros-
pect:-Lastly, Its moderate discipline, endeavouring to regulate-
the behaviour of the students by a regard to interest and re-
putation, more than by authority; and substituting the anxious
watchfulness of a parent, in place of the troublesome and
vexatious interpositions of a prying and perhaps unpopular
magistrate.
