     Statistical Account

ragement to serve his Majesty now is much better, in conse-
quence of the late humane and important regulations, rela-
tive to the mode of paying their wages, which enable them
to be of service to their families.  For these regulations, (of
which copies have been transmitted to the clergy throughout
the kingdom, in order to be communicated as occasion should
require,) they are indebted to the laudable attention of the
Right Honourable Henry Dundas, acting as Treasurer of the
Navy.  Still they complain, that the boatswain is rough, as
the element around him; for which at times there may be
need.

   Poor.-As begging is a free trade here; perhaps too many
are allowed to profess it; yet it would require much ten-
derness and delicacy to restrain it.  The weekly collections
of the 2 established congregations, make about 15 s.  The
interest of a small fund*, and some other adventitious aids,
enable the session to distribute about 7 L in every six weeks,
among upwards of 100 of the most needy, who are on their
roll, and a trisle to about 60 more, at the annual dispensation
of the sacrament of the Lord's supper, when the collection
commonly exceeds 20 L  Assessments are not desirable if
they can be prevented; but ere long they will probably be
unavoidable here, especially if the fishery continues to be the
principal business of the place.

   Distilleries.-Next to the fishing of herrings, the business
most attended to in Campbelton, is the distilling of whisky;
which the following is the state for the present year.

*Major SAM. KILPATRICK, a native of this parish, who died
a few years ago, in the service of the East India Co. bequeathed
100 L to the poor of the parish.
