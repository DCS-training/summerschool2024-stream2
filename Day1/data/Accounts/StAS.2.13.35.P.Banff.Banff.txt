    stories.  It contains a hall, two large drawing-rooms, Town-coun-
    cil Chamber, Sheriff-court Room, Town Chamberlain's and Sheriff
    Clerk's offices, and prisons.   The staircase and landing-places
    are spacious.
       There is a Trades' Hall, mason lodges, &c. but neither these nor     I
    any of the other buildings in the parish are, as buildings, deserv-
    ing of any notice.  It may be mentioned, however, that a few of
    the more considerable private houses lately built in the town have
    been designed with some degree of regard to architectural sym-
    metry and decoration, and present rather handsome fronts.    Al-
    most ever kind of building material is easily procured.  Plain
    walls are generally built of a sort of soft blue slate.   Window ri-
    bats, or whole fronts, are of dressed granite or sandstone.  Bricks-
    are also employed for slighter or more temporary purposes.

                         1811,                   3603
                         1821,                   3855

       The decrease between 1821 and 1831 is ascribed, in the Go-
    vernment, return, to absence of public works and emigration.
       The average of registered births for the last seven years is 62;
    of. marr ages, 25.  There is no official register of deaths; but, from
    a private list kept'by the grave-digger, the average number of bu-
    rials, annually, in the churchyard of Banff, appdars to be 55.
       Lord Fife is the only beritor that has a residence in the parish.
    His Lordship has been living constantly at Duff House for more
    than two years past.  Perhaps it would be difficult to name mo're
    than one or two other persons of independent fortune in the parish.
    There are only three proprietors of land of the yearly value of
    L. 50 or upwards.
       The writer can learn of only 1 insane person in the parish, and
    4 fatuous; of none blind (from natural causes;) nor of an deaf
    or dumb.
