charges itself into the Solway Frith.  The most remarkable
hills are, the Pen of Eskadalemuir and Lochfell.  The soil is,
in general, very deep, but, owing to its high situation, not
very fertile.  Most part of it is moss, covered with a coarse
kind of grass.  Along the banks of the White Esk, however,
the hills are, in general, green, and afford excellent pasture.
From the height of situation, and the nature of the soil, the
air is, in general, damp; but since the introduction of drain-
ing, it is greatly improved.  Property in land has changed
often in the memory of the present inhabitants.  It common-

rent at about 10 s. an acre.

rate calculation, they ploughed twice as much as they do now.
The reason of their leaving it off, was owing in part to the
uncertainty of the climate, but chiefly to the great demand
in late years for sheep and wool.  At present, there are about
200 acres in constant tillage.  But if the demand for sheep and
wool increase as it has done for some years past, it is probable
that still fewer will be in use; for they think that, in many
places, it either hurts the sheep walks, or might be of more
advantage in affording them a retreat in times of storm.  For-
merly they were wont to stock much with black cattle among
their sheep; but experience has taught them their error.
They render the grounds unhealthy for sheep, and introduce
diseases.  There are still some, however, who retain the old
practice, from a desire to make sure of a part of their stock;
wet years being found to prove less hurtful to them than to
the sheep.  They are ready, however, to acknowledge that
they, are far from being in profitable; for, after the trouble of
keeping and feeding for 6 or 8 months, they, seldom gain more,
