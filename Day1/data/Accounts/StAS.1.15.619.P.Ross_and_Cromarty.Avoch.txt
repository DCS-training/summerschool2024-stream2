nants raise also a little flax.  But, as they seldom have ground
in proper heart for it, it answers poorly; nor is there a mill
in Ardmeanach for dressing it.  About 50 years ago, the
culture of hemp was practised, to the extent of from 0 to
40 acres in this parish.  But since the importation of that
article has become more frequent, they do not now sow a
third part of the former quantity.  More than 10 acres are
now planted yearly with potatoes; which, besides preparing
the land for barleys are exceedingly useful in their families.
Clay is much used over all this country as a manure.  They
mix it with the dunghills in summer, and spread it out on
their light grounds intended for barley in the spring.  They
imagine it has a good effect in keeping out the summer heat
and drought from hurting the roots of the corn.  It may
thus in some measure correct the soil, but the kind of clay
used by many of them, can add very little to the vegetable
food of plants.  But the chief error of these tenants is, that
they rest little of their grounds, and these only when quite
worn out; nor do they sow any grass seeds.  This obliges
them to send off most of their cattle to remote highland glen
for the summer, where they lose many of them, and their
growth is much retarded.  What a loss must it also be to
their farms, to be deprived of the dung of those cattle for a-
bout five months of the year?
   Such extreme backwardness in the state of farming here, is
occasioned partly by the tenants own obstinacy, that they will
not follow good example set before them by the gentlemen
farmers; partly by their poverty, as few of them can afford
to purchase good utensils or grass feeds; but chiefly by the
highness of their rents, the scarcity of servants, and the short-
ness of their leaves:  which in few cases exceed 7, 8, or 15
years.  Another bar to improvement is the neglect of winter
herding.  For from the end of harvest to the middle of A-
