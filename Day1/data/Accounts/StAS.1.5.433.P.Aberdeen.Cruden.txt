   Extent, Situation, Surface and Soil.-The parish is a
very regular compact field, extending about 8 or 9 miles
along the British Ocean towards the south and about 7 or
8 miles into the land westward.  It is situated in chat di-
vision of Aberdeenshire, called Buchan, in the presbytery
of Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen.  The soil is various.
A large portion of it is deep rich clay which, with very
little exception, extends along the coatt till within a little
of the castern extremity, which is the only strong piece of
ground in the parish.  All the rest of it, except the mosses
and a few banks, could easily be made arable.  Towards
the W. and N. the ground in general is light and gravel-
ly, or black and mossy.  There is very little loam in the
parish, but some excellent fields of yellow soil, upon a clay
bottom.  There is an immense quantity of peat moss,
which extends all along the march to the N.  There are
also patches of moss in other places, and a pretty large
portion of the moss of Loch Lundie, on the Lde next to
Slains.

   Villages.-There are 4 villages or sea towns, altogether
occupied by sea-faring people, and consequently situated a-
long the coast, viz. Long-haven, Bu ler's Buchan, Ward and
Whinnyfold.  None of them are very populous, having

enquiring into the meaning of a groove in the middle of the stone, was
told, there had been a plate of copper, inserted into it, with some in-
scription.  The different place where the dead have been buried, do yet
strongly mark the field of battle
