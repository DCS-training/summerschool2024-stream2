of the House of Commons) was obtained in 1838. In this act the
management of the Leith Docks and Harbour was committed to
eleven commissioners, five appointed by the Lords of the Trea-
sury, three by the city of Edinburgh, and three by the town of
Leith. The interest on the Government debt was postponed.
A sum of L. 7680 yearly was to be preferably secured to the city
of Edinburgh, for the following purposes: first, L. 2000 was to
be appropriated to the payment of stipends of the Edinburgh
clergy in lieu of the merk per ton which was to be abolished;
secondly, L. 3180 were to be paid for behoof of the city creditors,
and the remaining L. 2500 were for "the maintenance and sup-
port of the college and schools of the said city."
   Powers were also granted to the commissioners (with the con-
sent and approbation of the treasury) to borrow additional sum
on the security of the docks, not, however, to exceed L. 125,000,
to be expended on the improvement, alteration, or enlargement of
the harbour and docks, or for the accommodation of the shipping
resorting to the same. It is enacted also, "that it shall be law-
ful to the said commissioners to abolish, reduce, equalize, and
consolidate the rates and duties leviable at the said harbour and
docks, so as to render the same more equal and just."
   Any surplus revenue that may occur after the payment of the
sums stated, and payment of interest of any money that may be
afterwards borrowed by the commissioners, is to be paid into Her
Majesty's treasury, and to be reckoned as so much towards the
extinction of the principal debt to Government.
   Since that period, under the direction of the commissioners,
the east pier has been considerably extended, and the harbour
deepened by dredging.
