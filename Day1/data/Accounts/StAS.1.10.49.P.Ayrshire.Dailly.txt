     of Dailly.

able manufacture has ever been established in the parish.  The
only artificers are those every where required for supplying
the common neccessaries of life.  A considerable number of
women, in the lower ranks, employ the greater part of their
time in working up the inferior wool of the country into a
coarse and flimsy cloath, which is carried to the fairs of Ayr
and Maybole, and bought up for exportation at the rate of
8 d. or 10 d. per yard.  By this species of rude manufacture,
a few unmarried women and widows earn the greater part of
a very scanty subsistence; but, in general, the profits of it are
consumed in purchasing and working up the finer wool into
cloaths for themselves and their families.  The following table
will give a distinct view of the division of the inhabitants ac-
cording to their respective occupations and modes of subsis-
tence.
