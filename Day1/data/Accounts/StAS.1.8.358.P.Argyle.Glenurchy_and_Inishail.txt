expence of land and water carriage, put it out of the power of
the many to enjoy the comfort of coal fires, even in the worst
of seasons.  And the sufferings of the lower classes, with re-
spect to firing, in wet years, during the rigour of winter, can
only be conceived by such as have felt them.  A few years ago,
many poor people in the West Highlands were obliged to burn
most of their household furniture, to repel the cold and to
prepare their food.  Old people and young children, unable
to bear the cold, were mostly confined to bed.

   Migratory Birds.-Our migratory birds are the cuckow,
the lapwing, the swallow, and the woodcock.  In revere win-
ters, the swan visits our lakes for a few weeks; and, though
a wary and watchful bird, it is not uncommon to fee it fall a
prey to the arts of the sportsman.  The Bohemian chatterer, a
bird of a mosl beautiful plumage and striking conformation,
was taken, last season, in this country.

   Eagles.-Premiums are given in this, and in many other
parishes, for the extirpation of the mountain eagle.  Yet
still, this bird of prey, so destructive to kids, lambs, and game,
is common in our wilds and deserts.  The eagle has either
loft much of its former audacity and strength, or the many
traditions respecting its assaults on the young and defenceless,
even of the human kind, are fabulous and unfounded*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is a traditon current in the Isle of Man, that a live infant, found in
the aerie of an eagle, was brought to the proprietor of the island; who, having no
children of his own adopted this fortunate foundling, and bequeathed him his
possessions.  The same authority assert, that thus child was the ancestor of the
Stanley family.  In the genealogical history of that noble house, there is no
allusion to this egendary pedigree, although the impression of an eagle and child,
on the coin of the Isle of Man, is probably owing to some such circumstance.
