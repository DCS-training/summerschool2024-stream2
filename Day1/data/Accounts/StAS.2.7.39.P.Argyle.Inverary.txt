   county, and the records of the synod of Argyle state a unanimous
   resolution come to by that body in 1640, to erect and maintain
   schools at their own expense; and their plan, when more fully
   developed, was, that there should be one. good school in every pa-
   rish; that the schools placed at the seats of presbyteries should
   be of a higher order, and maintained by the ministers and elders
   composing these presbyteries respectively; that at Inverary there
   should be. a grammar school, to which, as to a provincial seminary
   under the superintendence of a doctor, the youth might resort
   from all parts, within the bounds, for instruction iu those brandhbs
   which could not be taught so well in the parish schools.
   To maintain this head school, it was resolved that 11 ilk brother
   shall pay ten merks yearly. Two thousand merks of voluntary
   contribution were given in 1648, for a foundation to it; and, in
   1649, the Marquis of Argyle, mortified 600 werks yearly for its
   use. Several sums were afterwards mortified for the benefit of
   this school, by Campbell of Stonefield and others, to the amount
