gig-boat, besides fourteen for the luggage-boats, &c.  This canal
affords employment for upwards of fifty-two men and seventeen
boys.
   The following table shews the progressive increase of passen-
gers, by this canal, for six years.

         In 1831, they amounted to  79,455

   The number of tons conveyed by the canal, for each of the last
six years, is as follows:

   Railways.-Besides the communication to the Clyde, by means
of the Cart, a company was formed sometime ago, with the view
of forming a railway, to proceed from the New Town of Paisley
to the Clyde, a little below the present landing-place at Renfrew.
On this railway, both goods and passengers will be conveyed.
It is now finished, and wilt be opened in the course of a few weeks.
   A railway is also in contemplation from Glasgow to Greenock,
and another from Glasgow to Ayr, and Kilmarnock, and other
towns in Ayrshire, which is expected to form part of the great
railway from Glasgow to London.  Both of these will pass near-
ly through the centre of Paisley, and will prove of great com-
mercial and tradiiig benefit to the place.
   Increase of Travelling.-It may afford some idea of the great
increase of travelling in this neighbourhood, if we bear in mind, that
in 1814, only once a week, on the Glasgow market-day, a coach
started from Paisley, to convey merchants to Glasgow, and bring
them home in the evening, whereas in 1834, just twenty years from
the former period, the passengers by the coaches to and from Glas-
gow were about 200 daily.  But we must add to these the passen-
gers by the canal during that year, estimated at 307,275 and those
by the Cart coastways, not fewer than 46,080, in order to form-
some idea of this vast increase ; and yet, to how greater
an extent, may we expect, it will be carried, when the different
railways in comtemplation are finished.
