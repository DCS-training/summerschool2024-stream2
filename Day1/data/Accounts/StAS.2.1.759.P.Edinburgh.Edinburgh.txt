   The price of gas by both companies has noW been reduced to
6s. 6d. per 1000 feet.
   Fuel.-Edinburgh being in the centre of the Scottish coal
field, is abundantly supplied with this article of fuel. Pit coal
appears to have been used as early as the year 1291; for in that
year a charter was granted to the abbot and convent of Dunferm-
line, giving, them the privilege of digging coal in the lands of Pit-
tencrieff in Fife. The working of coal mines, however, seems to
have been carried on to a very small extent even for centuries after
this; for in the early history Of Edinburgh, we have already alluded
to several fires caused in the burgh, by the ignition of peats and
brushwood piled up in the narrow closes. The city is now sup-
plied with coals brought from the pits a few miles to the south-
ward, by means of the Dalkeith Railway; as also with coals from
the western districts carried by the Union Canal, and by the
Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The price of these coals va-
ries according to quality. Before the means of conveyance already
mentioned was opened up, the price of coals varied from 12s. to
14s. per ton. They are now reduced to from 8s. to 12s. deliver-
ed at the doors. English coals cost L. 1 per ton, including all
expenses.
The annual quantity of coals carried into Edinburgh is As follows:
