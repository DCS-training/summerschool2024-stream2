     Statistical Account

   The present Duke of Atholl has planted upwards of
4000 acres.  The principal species he cultivates is the la-
rix; a small proportion of Scots firs being intermixed with
them.
   It is to be regretted, both by the naturalist and the land-
holder, that so few registers have been kept or published
respecting the growth of trees.  In truth, such registers it
must at all times be difficult to procure, from the length of
time to be passed in amassing facts, before any useful deduc-
tion can be drawn.  No man loves to enter on a train of
reasoning, where half a century must be spent in collecting
his premises.  The following Tables, stating the relative
growth of different species of trees, planted at Dunkled, are
given as a valuable present to the planter*.  The circum-
ference of the trees was measured 4 feet from the ground,
at the dates mentioned.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The Tables were kept, and the measurements made, by the late Mungo
Murray, Esq; of Kincairney.
