	   Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers extend back to
	the year 1695; but they are neither voluminous, nor have they
	been regularly kept,-except under the former incumbent.
	   Antiquities.-In the burial-place, there is the ruin of an old
	church, which probably was erected when Popery prevailed, or
	perhaps at a later period.  Near it, there are the remains of a build-
	ing, which originally occupied a considerable space of ground,
	and is generally supposed to have been an establishment of monks,
	hence called Monk's House.  About three-quarters of a mile to
	the west, stands a venerable building, which was erected by Bishop
	Graham, one of the last Bishops of Orkney under Episcopacy.
	Above the door, the bishop's initials, G. G., with the Episcopal'
	arms, and the year of its erection, 1633, are inscribed.  There
	are still tumuli to be seen in the parish.            '
				III.-POPULATION.
	   According to the Old Statistical Account, "in the year 1754,
	there were 1000 persons in the town of Stromness.  In the year
	1794, there were 1344 souls, and yet the whole population is
	about the same as that given in 1754; from which, it appears
	that the population of the country has decreased, in proportion as
	that of the town had increased.  By an accurate census taken in
	June 1794, the population is as follows:"

	<TABLE>
                             No. of Houses.  No. of Families.  Males.  Females.   Total.
         Stroraness parish,        184            184           346        449       795

                                   -----         ----         -----       ----     -----
                         Total,    406            526           839       1900      2189
	Persons to a family in the parish of Stromness, nearly 4 1/3. In
	the town of Stromness, nearly 4 to a family and 6 to a house.
	Proportion of males to females, parish of Stromness, nearly as 3
	males to 4 females.  Town, nearly 12 males to 21 females.  The
	great disproportion of males to females in the town of Stromness
	is occasioned -by the young men going abroad to various parts of
	the world ; to the Greenland fishery, Hudson's Bay, the coal
	trade ; and many are to be found in his Majesty's navy."
	   In 1831, the Government census gave the following results:---
