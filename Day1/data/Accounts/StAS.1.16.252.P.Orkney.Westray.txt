called Fitty and Gallo, stretching from S. to N. in a line
of between 3 and 4 miles.  This island towards the E. and
a little removed from Fitty and Gallo hills, is about 2
English miles over; but about the middle space of the
island, the breadth is scarcely an English mile over.  From
guess of the eye, these does not appear to be above 1-8th
part of the surface of this island under cultivation.
   The island of Papa Westray, lies on the north side of

island of Westray.

produce is straw for his horses, the grain seldom or ever
comes to any perfection.  The farmer here generally uses
a plough with one stilt, much in the form of the old Ro-
man plough.  The only rotation of crops is small grey oats
and bear, commonly called big; the time of sowing the
