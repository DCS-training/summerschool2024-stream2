premiums they have received, it appears that their labour
has not been in vain.  In the year 1790, there were 97 acres
of ground, within the bounds of this parish, sown with lint-
seed, which in general succeeded weel, and procured the pre-
miums given by the Society for raising of flax in this county.
There are from 40 to 50 ploughs in this parish, of different
constructions.  Some of them are drawn by 4 horses, and 
others by 2.  When 4 horses are yoked, 2 servants are re-
quisite; but when two do the work, one man is sufficient, as
he both holds the plough, and drives the horses.  This last
mode of plowing has been introduced, partly from the im-
proved state of the farm, and partly from the increase of
servants wages.  It will be admitted by the candid, that im-
provements in husbandry, as in the fine arts, arrive at matu-
rity by degrees.  Encouraged by success, the farmers in this
parish have, within these 20 years, made rapid progress in
the cultivation of their lands.  And as their farms are not
over-rented, they are enabled to go on with their improve-
ments.

   Cattle.-It may not be improper to observe, that great at-
tention is paid to the breeding of cattle; but little to the
feeding of them.  They are, for the most part, brought to
the market about 3 years of age.  There is only one grazier
in the parish.  It is remarkable, that there is not within the
bounds of this parish one flock of sheep, especially when we
consider, that the greater part of it is hilly.  Perhaps the pe-
riod is not far distant, when the farmers may see their interest
in this particular, and take the benefit which their local situ-
ation evidently points out.

   Wages.-The yearly wages of men servants, in the diffe-
rent branches of husbandry, are from 71. to 81.  Sterling;
