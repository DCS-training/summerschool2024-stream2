to that of the clay.  There are fields of blue clay, fields of
orange clay, and fields of light land, all on the same farm;
and even in the same fields part is sometimes clay, and part
sand, and often a mixture of both.  The blue clay is thought
to be richer than the orange, and more easily cultivated.
Both are equally productive by proper management.  The
sand where there is little or no clay is very easily managed,
though not so productive as the clays.  But where there is a
proper mixture of clay and land, which is often the case, it
is easily managed, and usually more productive than any of
the other.  The Earn, by breaking down the opposing banks
in its serpentine turning, has formed beautiful links or
haughs, alternately, on each side of its stream.  The high
spring tides, which overflow there haughs, carry back, and
leave on their surface, the finest particles of the clay washed
down by the river.  This clay mixing with the rushes, and
rich grasses that grow and rot on there haughs, has formed a
soil of amazing fertility.  Some of there haughs are now re-
cured from being overflowed by embankments.  The soil of
the bank, that runs diagonally through the plain, is vege-
table mould, or loam with a mixture of sand; in some parts
a mixture of till or natural clay.  Above the bank, to the
foot of the hills, there are large fields of deep loam, some
small fields of natural clay, but, in general, the soil is a
light loam, with a mixture of sand or till, and a gravelly
bottom.  This gravelly bottom conveys the water from the
hills, which, when not carried off by proper drains, is very
hurtful.  The soil in general, among the hills, where they
are arable, is a light vegetable mould, with some banks in-
clining to till or natural clay.
