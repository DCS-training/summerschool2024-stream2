     of Wemyss.

   At Kirkland, in the N. E. extremity of the parish, on
the river Leven, near the ports of Methil and Inverleven,
a large spinning work has been carried on for some time,
by some gentlemen of London and Dundee, under the firm
of Aislabie, Nielson, and Company.  They spin a consi-
derable quantity of cotton and linen yarn, particularly of
the latter, which they have begun to manufacture into
cloth.  Their yarns are approved of, and they are believed
to be going on very successfully.  The situation of this
establishment is a very advantageous one, and it is capable
of great extension, as well for bleaching and printing, as
for spinning the yarns and manufacturing the cloth.  The
company already employ about 300 people, and the busi-
ness seems to be increasing.  Previous to the establishment
of this work, there were at Kirkland only two or three
houses, but now a number of very neat and convenient
houses are built, and in a short time it is probable that it
will be a considerable village.  Kirkland is said to have
been the place first proposed by the Carron Company for
establishing their works.
   A little to the west of Kirkland is a waulk or fulling-
mill, and dye-house, where business has been long carried
on, and is considerably increased of late years, There is
only one corn-mill in the parish, but there are others
equally convenient on Colonel Wemyss's property, lying
in the parish of Markinch.
   The maritime commerce has much increased of late.
There are 10 square-rigged vessels and one sloop belonging
to this parish, whose register measure may amount to up-
wards of 1480 tons.  They are mostly employed in the
carrying trade.  They are generally loaded with coal out-
wardly, and bring home wood, iron, flax, etc. from the
Baltic to the different ports in the frith of Forth.  Some
