amounting to 130 L. and lent out for the above purpose.  The
yearly collections formerly were 12 L. they are now about
17 L.  These funds are managed by the kirk session, the
trustees in the first instance, who generally take care that the
yearly income and disbursements keep pace with one another,

poor are allowed to stroll into other parishes; and there is
seldom an instance of one begging within the bounds of the
parish itself, yet the country, in general, and this parish in
particular, is much visited, or rather infested, by strolling
poor, from other quarters.  One cause of this is the improper
police of some larger towns.  Nothing is more common than
to banish those that are convicted of bad practices the "Li-
"berties of the city," as they are called.  This is neither
more nor less, than to punish the adjacent country for sins
committed in the town, to lay it under contribution for the
convenience of the city, and free the one of nuisances by
sending them to the other.  Because the worthless behave ill
in one part of the kingdom seems no good reason for send-
ing them over the country at large; and allowing them a
wider range for their depredations.  Banishment, besides,
from one particular district, or, in other words, enlargement,
is no punishment to vagabonds, but the contrary.  It is told
of a soldier, from a neighbouring kingdom, who being con-
victed of mal-practices, was to be banished Scotland for life.
When the judge intimated the penalty, "Bless your honour,"
said the culprit, "put your sentence soon in execution."
