    the shelter which it gave to the fugitives on this occasion. On
    the rock there is still to be seen the initials of some of them, to-
    gether with the date of the period when they took up their abode

	In several places stone coffins have been found in the parish,
    and also cairns, about which tradition is silent. They have been
    dug up in a bank upon the Lyne in the Temple lands near Lin-
    ton; and a Roman urn is stated to have been found in a cairn
    still remaining in Garvaldfoot moor. A few years ago, on a rising
    ground called Castlelaw, immediately above Linton on West Third,
    there stood a cairn where there was found a stone coffin rudely
    put together, the contents evidently showing the remains of bones
    and, from the height to which the stones had been carried, plainly
    manifesting that the body of a person of no small consideration
    had been buried on the spot. *
                         III.-POPULATION.
	The population remained nearly stationary for some years after
    the publication of the last Statistical Account in 1790.  Since that
    period, it has increased by additional hands being employed in
    cotton weaving, agricultural improvements, and the formation of
    roads.
