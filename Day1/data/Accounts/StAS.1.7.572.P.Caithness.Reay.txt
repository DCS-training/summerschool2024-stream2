mouth of the bay in 1771; another, laden with logs, at
Dunreay, in 1781.  Two sloops were wrecked in the same
year; one in the Bay of Bighouse, the other in the Bay of
Sandside.  A brigantine, laden with salt, was lost at Lybster
in 1788; and a herring burs at Portskerry in 1789.

   Sea-fishes.-The fishes caught upon the coast are cod, ling,
turbot, haddock, skate, whiting, dog fish, mackarel, horn-
back, sand-eels, and flounders.  The best season for the cod
and ling is from the beginning of April to the beginning of
July.  They are taken with the hand line, the great line,
and the small line.  Haddocks, the white of the cod's belly,
sand-eels, limpets, and crabs, are used for baits.  A sort of
small fish, of the size of trouts, named sillacks, and supposed
to be the fry of large fishes, are taken in great numbers
among the rocks on the shore with a pock-net, having some
broken crabs cast into it for baits.  The cods are commonly
at 2 d. ling at 5 d. and skates at 3 d. each.  The haddocks
are in their greatest perfection in Decembers, and sometimes
large enough to bring 2 d. each.  Seals abound on the coast;
and it has been occasionally visited by whales, sharks, and
porpoises.

   Sea-ware, Shells, etc.-The winter storms frequently throw
in broken pieces of sponge; and, among these, now and
then, whole sponges spreading out in a bush, from one stem.
Enough of shell-sand is thrown up on the shore, but very
few entire shells.  At flood-mark, indeed, the shell of the
sea-urchin often appears.  The sea-ware, used as manure, is
thrown by storms in great heaps into the bays and creeks,
and is a mixture of tangle, and other common sea-weeds.
At Portskerry, and round the Bays of Bighouse and Sandside,
about 20 tons of kelp might be annually made.  The tide
