     CONCLUSION.

   There is nothing which can give an intelligent and contempltive mind,
more real satisfaction, than to see the state of an interesting district thus
analysed.  It is only by means of such statements, that any idea can be
formed, of the real circumstances of a county, and consequently of the
means of improving it.  It certainly would be desirable, to have the infor
mation above sketched out, ascertained with minuteness and accuracy, but
that could not be expected, at the first attempt of a private individual, car-
ried on by his won personal exertions, and who principally relied on the meal
of those to whom he addressed hunted for information.  It will scarcely be
credited, in future times, that such an undertaking could be completed un-
der such a disadvantage; and those fortunate individuals, by whose in-
dustry and public   the Work was accomplished, in addition to the satis-
faction which they must derive from their own mind, will have then re
mo  celebrated by their grateful posterity.
