     of Turreff.

   Name, Antiquities, etc.-According to some Turreff, in
the Gaelic language, signifies towers.  According to others,
it signifies a mount or height.  The situation of the town,
and the vulgar pronunciation, Torra, an old law term signi-
fying a mount, favour the last supposition.  But the former
is no less probable, because near the church-yard gate, and
on the south side of the street betwixt it and the cross, part
of the vaults of an ancient tower is to be seen, from which,
or some building of that kind; the west end of the town is
still called the Castlehill.
   It is highly probable that Lathmon, the Pictish prince,
whom Ossian celebrates, had his seat in this parish.  Not
only do Lathers and Durlathers bear a strong resemblance
to Lathmon and Dunlathmon, but the landscape drawn by
nature exactly corresponds with the description of the poet.
We may observe on the bank of the river, "the green
"dwelling of Lathmon."  We may wander, with "the blue-
"ey'd Cutha in the vales of Dunlathmon;" and the halls of
Nuath are only wanting to realise the description of the dy-
ing Oithsna.  "High walls rise on the bank of Durranna,
"and see their mossy towers in the stream."  A rock ascends
behind them with "its bending firs."  On a farm adjoining
to Lathers are the remains of a Druid temple.
   A spot of ground on the south side of the town called
Temple-brae, and a house called Temple feu give reason to
suppose, that the Knights-templars once had a footing in this
place.  This is the more probable, as some of the old pro-
prietors of this house, held their charters from the Lords
Torphichan, to whom a considerable part of their lands had
been given by the Crown, after the order of Knights-tem-
plars was dissolved in the beginning of the 14th century.
-Some houses called Abbey-land, Maison-Dieu, or house of
refuge, point out the situation of an hospital or alms-house,
