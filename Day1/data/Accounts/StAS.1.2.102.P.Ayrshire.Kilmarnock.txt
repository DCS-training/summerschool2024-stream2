and he can only make a change to another in the last year of
that break.  Thus, they are nearly deprived of the power of
observing any regular rotation; and every one must see the
disadvantage that this must prove to all concerned.  The only
reason given for this restraint is, to put it cut of the power
of the farmer to run out his grounds at the end of the lease.
But though he cannot, in consequence of this restriction, over-
plow them; yet, by doing little or nothing, during the last
break, he leaves them in a condition, poor enough to be high-
ly detrimental to the interest of the proprietor, whilst it proves
an effectual check to the genius of the farmer, and prevents
his trying many useful and important experiments, by which,
both tenant and landlord, and indeed the public at large,
would be benefited.  Perhaps it might be more expedient to
let leases upon one or more lives, leaving the period of their
termination uncertain; or the tenants might be allowed to
blow as much for four years, as they could properly manure the
third year, which would be a great encouragement to their ex-
ertions*.

* At the commencement of improvements in this part of the
country, the sowing of what is called bear pease, or giving a crop
of pease the same pains, manure, and attention, that is usually be-
stowed on a crop of barley, was found the best mode of bringing
in poor, weedy, or worn-out ground.  The method practised was as
follows:  In the beginning of winter, or as early in the spring as pos-
sible, the ridges were plowed and gathered; and then, as soon as the
oatseed was sown, the ground was well barrowed, the solid crowns of
the ridges were turned out by the plow.  About 40 or 50 bolls of
lime, and about as many carts of dung, or perhaps rather more of
both, if the land was very poor and stiff, were then led out and
spread upon each acre; this was plowed down, and then sown with
a late kind of small gray pea, which runs out to a great length, and
continues lengthening and flowering till the end of the season.  They
