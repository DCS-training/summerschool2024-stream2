able, or above 8 years of age.

		 In 1811, the population was  749

                    1831,                     773

	The decrease of population may be imputed to the consolidation
of farms, the non-residence of heritors, the removal of part of the
population to towns in quest of employment, and of late to Ame-
rica,--twenty individuals having emigrated to that country from
this parish in the year 1831.
	There are 8 proprietors in this parish, having yearly rentals of
L. 100 and upwards. The gross rental of the parish is L. 4561.

	Character of the People.--They are generally sober, frugal, and
industrious, and, as a proof of this, there is not an alchouse in-
the parish. I regret to add, however, that illicit intercourse be-
twixt the sexes has become more common than it appears to have
been forty or fifty years ago; the number of illegitimate births be-
ing not less on an average than three in the year. I should add,
too, that poaching is not uncommon, and is hardly considered to
be unlawful.
