and fattened for the butcher.  While at work, these bullocks
were plentifully fed with hay, straw, or occasionally potatoes,
with the addition of a small weekly allowance of corn.  The
oxen thus fed and applied to labour, were found to have
nearly the same strength of draught as horses; but their
pace, under the yoke, was so much flower than the ordinary
pace of the horse, that three ploughs drawn by oxen, did not
commonly perform more labour than two ploughs drawn by
horses would, within the same space of time, perform.  The
working bullock was, however, nourished at one half of the
expence of the sustenance to the working horse, and was
much less liable to disease.  For ploughing stony unequal
ground, the ox is less fit than the horse; because, when the
plough chances to strike upon any obstacle, such as a rock
or root, in the furrow, the ox is too indocile and refractory,
to step back with the same readiness as the horse, and suffer
the ploughman to turn his instrument aside from the obstacle
which it cannot remove.  All the agricultural improvements
of the lite Admiral Stewart were prosecuted on a large scale,
and at a great expence.  So many of them were, of necessity,
merely experimental, that they cannot be supposed to have
every one already repaid the expence at which they were
made, with a reasonable surplus of profit.  But they must, in
the whole, have so augmented the fertility of the soil, and so
increased its value by the addition of such a capital sunk up-
on it, that the lands cannot, in the end, fail to yield an en-
larged produce and rental, more than sufficient to compen-
sate, fully, all the care and expence at which they have been
improved.  This highly cultivated condition of the estate of
Glasserton, is undeniably a fine monument of the taste, judg-
ment, and ardent public spirit of its-late proprietor.
