1000 black cattle, 109 horses.  The parish imports ar-
ticles of provision.  The soil is friendly to slax.  This year
the incumbent had 5 stone Tron weight of unheckled lint,
upon 1 peck sowing.  The want of a lint-mill is a disad-
vantage to the country.  Seed-time is generally in April,
and harvest in September.  There are 24 ploughs of the
Scotch kind, and 28 carts.  The land-rent may be about
L. 1300 Sterling.  The rent of the best arable land is be-
tween 15 s. and 20 s. the acre.  The state of this parish
in the years 1782 and 1783, was not so bad as that of
many others; but the crop in general, over the whole,
suffered from the summer's cold and the wet harvest.  The
poor were the better for the supply granted by Govern-
ment.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, etc.-The church was built in 1783
and the manse in 1773.  The value of the stipend, inclu-
ding the glebe, is L. 100 Sterling.  The number of the
poor is 20, the annual contributions for their relief, about
L. 10 Sterling.

   Prices and Wages.-About 30 years ago, 4 s. was a great
price for sheep; at present, it is 12 s.; a cow at that
time sold at L. 1, 5 s. and now at L. 4 Sterling.  Every
thing else of meat kind is equally high in proportion.
Meal is mostly at the same rate it was then.  Within
these 20 years, servants and labourers have tripled their
wages or rather quadrupled them.  A servant man de-
mands L. 8 Sterling, 4 pair of shoes, and his victuals:
About 20 years ago, he would have been glad to get
L. 3 Sterling a-year.  A servant-maid L. 2, 10 s. Sterling,
and her victuals, and 2 pair of shoes.
