     Statistical Account

aught I know, may be equally medicinal and salubri-
ous, was the following circumstance: One of my prede-
cessors in office, who happened to have some knowledge of
physic, resorted to it perpetually while he lived, and was
able to walk to it, and drank of it most copiously.  In the
course of his reiterated visits he discovered a rich kind of
marl and limestone round the well.  Whether the water

of Cathel; it is 3 miles long, 2 broad, if not more, very

They all abound with excellent trout, and eel of different
kinds and sizes; these fishes differ also in colour, according
to the nature of the lake where they were spawned.  In the
lake of Cathel there are trouts, which are found no where
else in the country, of a reddish beautiful colour, a pretty
shape, very fat, and most pleasant eating.  I suspect they

ring.  There are no pike-fish in any of them, which is an
advantage, for reasons well known.

   Rivers, their Fish, and Bridges.-There are several wa-
ters in the parish, which are perpetually supplied from
there lakes, and some other lakes in the neighbouring pa-
rishes.  In time of speat or flood, all these waters are both
