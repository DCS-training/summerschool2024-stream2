"Lands, ex boreali, et occidentali partibus montis castri
"de Banff*."
   The Castle of Inchdrewer, on the estate of Lord Banff, is
situated on a fine rising ground, about four miles south-west
of the town.  It is still entire and habitable.  By the stile
of its architecture, it seems to have been built about the
time of King James IV. or v.  This is the opinion of the
celebrated Grose, who in his book of Antiquities has given
a correct view of this castle+.
   Two fields, near the confines of this parish, are distin-
guished by the names of Arrdane and Swordane.  Whether
these have ever been the scenes of battle, and derived their
names from the arrows and swords of the Danes, must be 
left to more able antiquaries to explore and determine.

   Population.-The writer of this report is not possessed of
materials sufficient to enable him to ascertain, with precision,
the number of inhabitants in this parish at former periods.
It is obvious, however, that the great increase of buildings,
in different parts of the town, has occasioned a proportion-
able increase of population.
   It appears from a list drawn up by the late minister, in
the year 1782, that the numbers in the town then were 
2380.  By a very accurate roll mad up 1797, the num-
ber is,
