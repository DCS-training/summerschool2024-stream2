     Statistical Account

March.  Cold seed oats are sown as early in March as the
ground and weather will admit; but hot seed oats may be sown
three weeks later; barley from the middle of April till the 8th
or 10th day of May.  The harvest is reckoned early, when it
begins before the 20th of August.-The advantages which
this parish enjoys are a very fertile and productive soil;-the
neighbourhood of the Tweed, and furnishing, by its carters,
such as lie to the north and west with coals and lime, by
their hired carts and horses; a centrical situation with regard
to the market towns of Berwick, Kelso, Dunse and Cold-
stream.-The disadvantages are, a ticklish soil, easily hurt ei-
ther by drought or rain, tho' no spot is more fertile when the
season exactly suits it; most impracticable roads, which no
skill nor attention hitherto has made effectually good; the hav-
ing no fuel but coals from Northumberland brought across
the Tweed at a ford precarious, and often fatal by the rashness
of the men and the sudden rise of the river: every season
some horses are lost in it; no peat, no fuel, no timber, except
the scanty and uncertain supply of thorn-hedges cut and sold;
and the total want of manufactures.

   Rent, Changes of Property, Agriculture.-The valued rent
of the parish is L. 4750 Scots: The real rent is about L. 4030
sterling; the number of English acres (exclusive of 14 acres of
glebes) is 5120 or thereabouts, which is nearly 16 s. an acre at
an average; the highest rent yet known is 25 s. per acre for a
few acres, the farm of Swinton quarter gives 23 s. per acre,
and the lowest rent here is 8 s.  There is all the certainty such
subjects admit of that this rent, instead of sinking, will rise
considerably.
   It has already been mentioned, that the founder of the Swin-
ton family got the lands of Swinton as a reward for his valour
in clearing the earth of those destructive animals, wild boars.
