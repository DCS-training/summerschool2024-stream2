For other particulars, reference must be had either to the queries, formerly printed, see Appendix, B. or to
the Analysis, inserted in the First Volume of the Statistical Account of Scotland.-Though many facts
may thus be shortly stated in the form of a table, yet they may often require a number of explanatory
observations, which may be sent at the same time.
