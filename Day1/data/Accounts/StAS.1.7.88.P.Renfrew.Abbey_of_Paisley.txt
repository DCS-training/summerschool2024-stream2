to 128 employed in Paisley, makes 137 in all.  The number
in 1744 was 93.  The spinning of cotton was introduced in-
to this parish in 1783.  The principal seat of that manufac-
ture is at Johnstoun, a neat and regularly built village about
three miles west from Paisley, upon the estate of Mr Houston
of Johnstoun.  The feuing of that village was begun in 1782,
and it contained at Whitsunday last 293 families, or 1434
souls.  There are five companies established in it for cotton
spinning.  Two of these carry on their principal operations
by water-machinery.  In the two mills employed in them,
there are going at present 11,672 spindles; but, when the
whole machinery in both shall be compleated, there will be
22,572.  The number of persons, young and old, at present
employed in both mills is 660.  There are besides about 120
spinning Jeenies employed throughout the parish; but the
number is daily increasing; and, when the machinery is com-
pleated which the buildings already erected are calculated to
contain, there will be about 150 Jeenies, exclusive of those in
the two great mills.  The number of persons employed in
this branch at present is, in all, about 1020.
   It is painful to think, that a manufacture which gives em-
ployment to so many hands, and which may be a source of
great wealth to individuals, may be productive of very un-
happy effects upon both the health and morals of the chil-
dren employed in it.  This there is some reason to appre-
hend.  The numbers that are brought together, especially in
the larger mills, the confinement, the breathing of an air
loaded with the dust and downy particles of the cotton, and
contaminated with the effluvia of rancid oil rising from the
machinery, must prove hurtful, in a high degree, to the de-
licate and tender lungs of children.  Add to this, that mills
which produce the water-twist are kept going day and night;
and children must be had who are willing to work through
