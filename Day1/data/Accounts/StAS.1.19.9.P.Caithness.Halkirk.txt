more than it actually is.  But I wilI not hesitate to affirm,
that, had our climate been equally good with our soil, the
inhabitants of more southern counties would covet our
more northern situation.  However, it must be acknow-
ledged, that neither our climate or soil are so agreeable as
could be wished, and that the respective nature of each, con-
tributes mutually to this disagreeable circumstance.  They
have a mutual influence on one another, as may appear
hereafter in the course of these observations.
   But this disagreeableness proceeds not so much from
our northern situation, as from other causes; such as the
swampness and flatness of the country; its abounding
so much in fens, marshes, lakes, etc.; its being exposed,
without any interruption, to the baleful influences of the
N. N.W. and N.E.; and finally, to the hills and moun-
tains on the S. and S.W. which inviron it in these quar-
ters, and intercept, in some degree, the genial and benign
influences of the S. and S.W.  From these high hills or
mountains, which are, as it were, the barriers between this
country and Sutherland, there is a declivity all along to
the N. N.W. and N.E. shores.  This contributes consi-
derably to the coldness, the inconstancy, and variableness
of our climate, being thereby devoted to all the evils that
come upon us from these quarters, over an immense tract
and body of water to the north pole.  But this circum-
stance is not more hurtful and disadvantageous to us, than
it is beneficial and advantageous to the neighbouring
county.  For these mountains shelter and defend them from
many of these evils to which we are exposed; and I am
truly of opinion, that had these mountains been situated in
a contrary direction to us, and the declivity of the country
in a contrary direction also, we would have a more agree-
able climate and soil than we have, though, by the bye, all
things considered, we have no great cause to complain.
