   Roads.-A small part of the military road from England
to Portpatrick passes through this parish on the south. This
road, made originally by Government, has certainly been
of material service to Galloway.  Still, however, it is to
be regretted, that it is neither so short nor so level as it
might have been made.  It has been said of it, that it
seems well adapted to the purposes of a military road, be-

frequent opportunities are afforded of reconnoitering the
motions of an enemy.  A read from Kirkcudbright to New
Galloway passes through the middle of the parish. Nei-
ther this, nor the parochial roads in general, are so com-
pletely made as they ought to be. The statute-labour is

   Antiquities.-In an island formed by the Dee, at the S. E.
corner of this parish, is situated the slately castle of
Thraeeve, or Thrive, formerly the residence of the Dou-
glasses, Lords of Galloway. For a draught and description
of this noble ruin, the reader is referred to the late Cap-

parish two moats, similar to those in other parts of the
country.  Several persons here suffered as martyrs, during
the persecution which prevailed in the last century.  In the
church yard there are grave-stones over three of them.
One of these has an epitaph engraven on it, the author of
which, no doubt, supposed himself to have been writing
poetry.  It is as follows:
