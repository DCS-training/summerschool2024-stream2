the edge coals has been On fire for 20 years past.  A far-
mer to dear his land of rubbish, which had remained after
an old pit had been filled up, had is gathered together, and
burnt upon the top of the pit.  Two or three years thereafter,
it was discovered that the fire had been continued down the
pit, through the coal rubbish with which it had been filled
up, and was found burning into the wastes or excavations
below.  Many endeavours have been made to have it extin-
guished, but hitherto (it is feared) without effect, for neither
can air be perfectly excluded, nor can the places on fire be
any how laid under water.

   Population.-In 1791, this parish contained rattler more
than 3000 inhabitants.  The return to Dr Webster, in 1755,
was 2190 souls.  For this increase the following reasons may
be assigned, viz. 1st, Manufactures have greatly increased,
particularly that of paper. 2d, Improvements of every kind
have been carried on to a great extent, which has occasioned
a greater demand for labourers. 3d, Some of the proprietors
have been in the use of feuming ground for building upon,
which, added to the plenty of coal in the parish, has induced
strangers to settle in it.
   Poor.-In so large and populous a parish, the number of
poor must of course be considerable.  There are, accordingly,
about 50 persons, who receive a stated allowance of from 2 s.
to 4 s. per month, besides others who are occasionally supplied.
The collections it the church doors, which amount to up-
wards of 30 L. per annum; the dues arising from mort-cloths,
marriages, and fines, which may be estimated, at 20 L. to-
gether with the interest of a capital stock of 333 L. 6 s. 8d.
have till lately, been sufficient to answer the demands.  But
these funds being now inadequate to the expenditure, the he-
ritors make up this deficiency by a voluntary contribution.
This mode they wisely prefer to an assessment, a measure
