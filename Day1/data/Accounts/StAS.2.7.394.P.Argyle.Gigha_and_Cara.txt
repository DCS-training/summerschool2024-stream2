                      PARISH OF GIGHA AND CARA.

                 THE REV. JAMES CURDIE, MINISTER.


                 I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-IN the former Statistical Account, the name of this
parish is said to be derived from the two Gaelic words, Eilean,
island, and Dia, God, written in the Gaelic Eilean Dhia, Sig-
nifying God's Island.  It is, however, more likely that the name
Gigha is derived from the Gaelic word Geodhap, a " creek," since
the island abounds in creeks and bays favourable for keeping boats
in ; whereas the opposite coast of Kintyre, to a great extents is
much exposed to the Atlantic, and without any creeks or ports
where vessels could lie hn safety.
  Cara is supposed to signify a monastery.
