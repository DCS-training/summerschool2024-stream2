   Cattle, Commerce, Fish, Manufactures, etc.-There are at
present, on the island, 33 horses, 350 black cattle, and 347
sheep.  The prices of provisions are regulated by the Green-
ock market.  The farmers find a ready sale for what they
can spare, after supplying their families, among the seafaring
people and tradesmen; who, besides a ready market, save
them the expence of carriage.  The fish chiefly caught here,
are haddocks, cod, whitings, lyth, cuddies, mackerel, and a
few herrings.  Of shell fish, too, there is some variety, but
in no great quantity.  No manufactures of any consequence
have ever been attempted here.  The chief obstacles, to any
considerable exertion in that way, are the expence of fuel,
the want of a sufficient run of water to drive machinery, and

*The farmers and their servants constitute but a small part of the com-
munity, the seafaring people being the most numerous.  Servants wages are
much the same as in the neighbouring parishes: men servants from 6 L. to 8 L.
Sterling, a year; women, from 3 L. to 4 L.  A mason gets 2 s., a joiner 1 s. 8 d., and
tailor 10 d., with meat, per day.
