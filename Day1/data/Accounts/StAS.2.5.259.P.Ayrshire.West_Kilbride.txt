                          III.--POPULATION.
	That the population of this parish at a former period experien-
ced a very remarkable decrease, there can be no manner of doubt.
The following particulars relative to this head have been as-
certained with much care and accuracy by Mr Smith, our pre-
sent excellent parochial teacher; and they certainly afford a cu-
rious and interesting view of the subject. From the register of
births, it appears that, from 1692 to 1718, inclusive, a period of
twenty-seven years, the annual average number of births was 42;
for five years subsequent to 1801, the population being 795, these
registrations average 19 8/5; and during five years preceding 1831,
population 1684, the annual average of births was 51 4/7. So that tak-
ing these data and criteria, the average population from 1692 to
1718, must have stood about 1373.
