       whereas the largest quantity of kelp ever made in one year (1826)
       was 3500 tons, which, at L.7 per ton, would produce L.24,500.*
          Manufactures.-The principal manufacture carried on, is that
       of straw-plait for ladies' bonnets; in which about 2000 girls are
       constantly employed, and almost all our young women, and some
       of the married, do more or less, in the intervals of their other oc-
       cupations.
          The building of boats, and making of sails, nets, and cordage,
       may also be mentioned; and there are two licensed distillers at
       Kirkwall, and one at Stromness.
          Navigation and Trade.-In 1833, there were 78 vessels belong-
       ing to Orkney, carrying 4049 tons, and 319 seamen; and probably
       the number has since increased.
          The following table shows the sums received in Orkney in 1833,
       from farm-produce, manufactures, fisheries, &c.
