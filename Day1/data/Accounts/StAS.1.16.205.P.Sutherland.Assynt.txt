   A few high military characters might be mentioned;
but such are presently passed by, as the naming of them-
would swell this tedious account too much.

   Antiquities.- It is at least presumable, if not highly pro-
bable, that Scandinavian idolatry did prevail here.  The
reason for entertaining this opinion is, that in inland Old-
ney there is a considerable cairn of stones, which might
originally have been a little temple; in that cairn is yet
to be seen a hollowed stone, having a lid, or cover of stone;
it is not a Popith four, for this reason, that one Donald
Macleod, alias Machomash, once residenter on Oldney-
mainland, and other old men in the neighbourhood, all of
them honest undesigning men, declared to the narrator,
that about 60 years ago there was a round stone within
the hollowed one, of the size and shape of a large egg, for
which especially, as also for the adjacent burial ground
there, they and their forefathers had the greatest venera-
tion:  That the above old people law that round stone:
That on account of its variegated minute colours of bright
and shade, it was always shown to strangers: That it was
stolen, or privately taken away by a seafaring man, to
whom, in the usual manner, it was shown as a curiosity,
Whether that round stone was or was not the stone of Loda,
mentioned by the immortal Offian, the narrator leaves to
be decided by researchers in antiquities; however, that no
lets ancient bard than sweet, sings of " Sniven and the
"stone of power."  The occasion was, Starno King of
Lochlin, having been defeated by Figal,
     *Calls old Snivan,
     Who oft had sung around the stone of power,
     And oft, when Lochlin's sons were known to yield;
     He turned the stream of battle on the field.
