and pike.  There are 131 horses, 648 head of cattle, and 50
sheep in the parish; of wild quadrupeds there are foxes,
badgers, polecats, and rabbits; of birds, partridges, wood-
cocks, black-cocks, snipes, etc.  A mason's wages are 1 s. 4 d.
a wright's 10 d, a taylor's 6 d. and a day-labourer's 6 d. a 
day, with victuals.  The fuel used here is coal and peat; the 
former costs 1 1/2 d. a stone.  The air is dry and healthy.

   Antiquities.-A Roman causeway runs through the middle
of the parish, on the highest ground; it is 20 feet broad, com-
posed of rough stones, closely laid together, and points west-
ward to a camp, still distinguishable, in the parish of Muthil,
and eastward to another, also visible, in the parish of Scone.
This causeway is in entire preservation, as the proprietor of
the adjacent grounds, though he inclosed the fields on each
side with stone-dikes, did not suffer a stone to be taken from
the road.  Along the causeway are stations capable of con-
taining 12 or 20 men; they are inclosed by ditches, yet very
distinct, and seem to have been designed for the accommodation
of the overfeers of the work.  Within Gask's policy, in this pa-
rish, vestiges of two Roman camps, one on the south, and
the other on the north of the causeway, are still visible; and
the ditches, with the Praetorium, are distinct, though the
ground is planted with fir.  One of these camps seems to
have been capable of containing 500 men, and other half 
that number.
