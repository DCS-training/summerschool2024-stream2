   The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have sta-
tioned one of their schoolmasters at Drumsork in Blacklunnans.
The present schoolmaster, who is an old man, has retired with
a salary of L. 7 Sterling; his son who is appointed assistant
has L. 9 Sterling yearly.  This institution is attended with sin-
gular advantage to that remote corner of the parish.  Young
people are taught reading, writing and arithmetic, and early
instructed in the fundamental principles of religion.  The
number of scholars is usually from 60 to 80.

   Poor.-The poor in this parish are not so numerous as for-
merly, and are always well supplied.-The heritors and ses-
sion meet every half year, when a list of poor is taken, and
their particular circumstances being duely considered, a suit-
able weekly pension is settled on each of them.-The funds
for their support are the weekly collections, the interest of
L. 161 Sterling, at L. 4 1/2 per cent, and the rent of home galle-
ries in the church.  As these do not amount to one half of the
sum required, the parish is assessed to make up what is defi-
cient; the heritors in the proportion of their valued rent pay
one half of the assessment, the other half is paid by the tenants.
   The inhabitants are sober and industrious, and regular at-
tendants on public worship:  With the improvement of their
outward condition, they are more liberal and humane in their
sentiments and dispositions.  The fruits of industry appear in
their dress and manner of living.  Mean cottages are exchang-
ed for more comfortable habitations, and those who before
found it difficult, with all their labour, to procure the necessa-
ries of life, now enjoy many of its comforts and conveniences.
