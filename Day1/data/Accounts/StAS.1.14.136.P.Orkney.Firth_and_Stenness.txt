+It is said, that the Earl of Caithness and Lord Sinclair were killed at
that skirmith; and that a stone is yet to be seen, upon a green spot in
Garmiston, near Bigwald, which was placed over the grave either of 
the one or of the other.  Wallace, in his account of the Orkneys, says,
"The Earl of Caithness and the Lord Sinclair, came with a great army by
sea, into Orkney, to have taken possession of it, as of a country to which they
pretended some right; but the people of the country, under the command
of Sir James Sinclair (natural son to Robert Sinclair, the last Earl of Ork-
ney of that sirname), encountered the Earl with such courage, at a place
called Summersdale, that his whole army was wholly discomsited; the 
Earl himself, with 500 of his men being killed; and the Lord Sinclair,
with all the rest, taken prisoners" Wallace adds, "poor Sinclair their
leader, drowned himself afterwards."
