sand; and some can boast of having inoculate ten thou-

   Fevers and consumptions are the consequence of hard la-
bour, bad food, and colds.  They are, therefore, most pre-
valent amongst the country people.  The food of many of
the people of this parish is extremely poor.  No attention
is paid to the advantage of a kitchen garden.  The houses,
too, are, in several places, wretched huts, scarcely capable
of supporting the roof, and far less to defend against the
storm and colds of winter.  The roads are likewise deep,
and impassable; and the insufficient clothing adds to the ge-
neral train of causes.
   It is therefore an object of great importance for the
heritors to repair the roads and houses.  It cannot be ex-
pected that a tenant, for 19 years, will make roads, or build
houses, to last for, perhaps, 100.  Hence, the poor tenant
patches up a miserable rickle, with a damp earthen floor,
more like a humble sheep-cote, than the rural habitation of
the generous farmer.  Unless the farmer be strong and vigo-
rous, the landlord cannot expect either a high or a well paid
rent; but, by making the tenants feel happy and comfort-
able, he may depend on a thriving tenant, and an increased
rental.
   A register of the weather will be inserted, among the ge-
neral tables at the end of this Report, along with a state of
the seasons for sowing and reaping the various crops raised
in the parish.

   Population.-In the year 1755, the whole number of
souls in the parish, according to the report to Dr Webster,
were 2730; but at present they amount to 3209, including
those employed at the Adelphi cotton-works.  A particu-
lar account of the population is given in the general tables,
shewing the number of families, farmers, tradesmen, etc.
