for this purpose, be made through all Scotland.  A contri-
bution of 1500 L.  Sterling was thus obtained.  The original
parish of Durness was, in consequence, divided into the 3
present parishes of Durness, Tongue, and Eddrachylish, in
the year 1724.  Stipends were assigned for the ministers of
these parishes, in certain proportions, out of the teinds of
Lord Reay's estate, and the interest of the money contribut-
ed.  The stipend then allotted to the minister of Durness,
was 800 merks Scotch, with 40 merks more, in the same
money, for communion elements.  Of these sums, 150 merks
were constituted payable out of the teinds of Lord Reay's
estate; the other 690 merks were to be received out of the
interest of the general contribution.  By a reduction of the
rate of the interest upon the mortified fund, this stipend
has been since diminished to the small sum of 42 L . 16 s. 8 d.
Sterling.  The glebe may be worth about 4 L. of yearly rent.

in the year 1692, and some part of it may have been built
still earlier.  The manse was first built in the year 1727; in
1771, it was repaired; and in the years 1785 and 1786, it
was entirely rebuilt.

are, 2 s. 6 d. for teaching Latin; 2 s. for arithmetic; 1 s.
6 d, for reading and writing; and 1 s. for teaching to read.
The schoolmaster has sometimes 20 s. and sometimes 1 L.
10 s. a year, as precentor and session clerk.  He has 1 s. for
every marriage, and 3 d. for a baptism.  But the salary and
perquisites could not maintain him, if his employers did not
