<FOOTNOTE>This beautiful non-descript Trochus was first found by Major Martin, Mayville
Cottage; and afterwards by ourselves near Stevenston burn-foot, where five specimens,
all that have ever been got, were found. The trochus it resembles most, is T. exas-
peratus, but it is lighter in the colour and larger in size, and broader in proportion
to its length. The T. exasp. is 3/8ths of an inch by 3/8ths. The new T. is 5/8ths of an inch
by 6/9.
          Who has not, when a boy, admired the easy and graceful motions of playful
trouts in a pool of limpid water? And have we not at times been disposed
to pity the shell-fish, capable as we thought of nothing more, if even so much as
snail-like motion; except when by the wave of the sea they were driven about and
tossed? We were riot a little pleased, however, lately to find, that our pity with re.
spect to some of them at least, is very much misplaced. We observed on a sunny
September day, in a pool of sea water left on Stevenston strand by the ebbing tide,
what we at first thought some of the scaly brood at play. On closer investigation,
however, we found that it was the fry of Pecten operctilaris skipping quite nimbly
through the pool. Their motion was rapid and zig-zag, very like that of ducks in a
sunny blink, rejoicing in the prospect of rain. They seemed, by the sudden opening
and closing of their valves, to have the power of darting like an arrow through the
water. One jerk carried them some yards, and then by another sudden jerk they
were off in a moment in a different tack, We doubt not that dwir fall-grown youths
engage in similar amusements, though as pectem of greater gravity they choose to
romp unseen, and play their gambols in the deep.
	This peclen is the clam, or as it is called in the west the champ, which children ga-
ther with delight on the shore, and at the age we saw it perform, it was only about
the size of a silver groat. The Pecten Jacobeus, a rarer species of the clam or scallop,
was worn by pilgrims of old as a token that they had crossed the sea on a visit to some
shrine, and were consequently entitled to
          		" Fix the Scallop their hat befere."
         Whis non-descript pecten is very beutiful, but we have never yet got a perfect
specimen. We found two valves at different times, but they were not matches, and
both of them seemed young. It resembled the fry of Pecten opercularis, but it had double
the number of ribs, and the ears were different in shape from those of P. opercularis.
