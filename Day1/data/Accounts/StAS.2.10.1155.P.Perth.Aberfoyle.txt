      During his incumbency there, he bad saved the life of Maxwell
      of Pollock, one of the Senators of the College of Justice, by af-
      fording him shelter when under proscription for his adherence to
      Presbytery.  On the ejection of the Episcopal clergy, under King
      William, Lord Pollock procured from the Montrose family the
      office of domestic chaplain for Mr Fisher.  Under cover of that
      title he officiated unmolested at Aberfoyle for thirty years, and
      was, beyond question, the last Episcopal clergyman who enjoyed
      a benefice in Scotland.  He died in 1732.  To him, in the same
      year, succeeded Mr James Richardson, a man whose learning
      rendered him respectable in the church.  He died in 1770, leav-
      ing an only son, who, at an early period of life, was appointed
      Professor of Humanity in the University of Glasgow, and who, in
      that situation, highly distinguished himself as an accomplished
      scholar and successful teacher.  Mr James Dymock was ordained
      minister of Aberfoyle in May 1773, and resigned his charge in
      April 1786.  He was succeeded in April 1787 by Mr Patrick
      Graham (afterwards Dr Patrick Graham,) who died in Septem-
      ber 1835, in the forty-eighth year of his ministry.  He was em-
      ment for the variety and extent of his literary acquirements,--a
      profound scholar, an able divine, and elegant writer, and publish-
      ed several works of well-known merit.  He was, besides, long en-
      gaged, as a member of the committee of the General Assembly, in
      revising the new edition of the Gaelic Scriptures.
        Land-owner.-His Grace the Duke of Montrose is the sole
      land-owner in the parish of Aberfoyle, being, at the same time,
      patron, proprietor, and superior.
        Parochial Registers.--One of the parochial registers is dated
      as far back as 1698, but it is now nearly illegible.  The other
      registers, which are not voluminous, appear to have been kept with
      tolerable regularity since 1753.

      <TABLE>

            In 1755, the population of Aberfoyle was 895
               1792,                                 790
               1821,                                 730
               1831, males, 331;   females, 329;     660
               1841,                                 549
        The census taken in 1821 is believed to be incorrect, but how far
      cannot now be stated.   When the last census was taken, some fa-
      milies were absent from the parish at wood-cutting and other em-
      ployments; but these, had they been present, would not have,
      added above 20 to the population.
        This decrease may be attributed in a great measure to the sys-
