     Statistical Account

   This parish, to the E. of the town, was once a continued
forest, called Platane.  At present there are no woods of great
extent; though a considerable quantity both of hard and soft
timber, of all kinds of ages, is interspersed up and down
the parish, especially on the estate of Kinnordy, the proprie-
tor of which is giving his seat every embellishment which
wood can bestow, as well as ornamenting the country, by
planting every piece of waste ground on his estate.  Mr.
Ogilvy of Clova, has likewise planted, within these few
years, 300 acres of Scotch and Larix firs, besides hard wood;
and continues to plant a certain number of acres every year.
There is, besides, in Glenprosen, a considerable quantity of
natural wood, mostly birch; and, were it not for the sheep,
it would soon become a forest, as the upper part of it, which
is still called the Forest of Glenprosen, has evidently been.

   Climate, etc.-The climate varies considerably.  The lower
part of the parish is far more mild and temperate than Glen-
prosen, except in the middle of summer, when, owing to the
reflexion of the sun's beams from the hills, the latter is per-
haps warmer than the former.  And, about the boundaries
of the parishes of Glammis and Forfar, the air is milder
than about the town, and to the northward of it.  Scrofula
and consumptions are the most common disorders; and we
are sometimes, though rarely, visited with putrid fevers.
The air is clear and salubrious; the people rather above the
common size, well made, strong, active, and healthy.  The
ague, which is common in the lower parts of Strathmore, is
unknown here; and, often, whilst Forfar, Glammis, and
Meigle, are enclosed in mist, there is none at Kirriemuir.
There are no instances of a remarkable longevity; but many
arrive at 80; and 2 or 3 died lately who were above 90.
