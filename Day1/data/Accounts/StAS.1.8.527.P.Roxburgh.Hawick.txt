need not repine; as it is thereby freed from many temptations
to idleness and dissipation, to which the inhabitants of royal
burghs, by their politics, are often subjected.

   Revenue, Market, etc.-The common, belonging to the town,
was formerly very extensive; but some of the surrounding
heritors, claiming a prescriptive right of pasturage, 6 parts of
20 were allotted to them.  The town's share now amounts
to about 850 acres, besides some places in its imme-
diate neighbourhood, which fell not under the division.
Previous to this division, the cattle belonging to the bur-
gesses pastured over the whole common; and this town
had no revenue, except what arose from the dues, or entry-
money of burgesses, which was inconsiderable.  Since the
division, the whole common is inclosed, and about 250 acres
let in one farm, besides other detached pieces, with several
areas feued for building.  The revenue, arising from these,
and what is exacted for pasturing the burgesses cattle, now
amount to 130 L; and still common sufficient remains to pasture
these cattle.  No part of the town's revenue is spent in eat-
ing and drinking, except a trifle at the King's birth-day, and
the election of the magistrates.  The magistrates and council
lately erected a neat council house, brought water into the
town in leaden pipes, and paved the streets anew.  The Duke
of Buccleugh, who draws the customs of the town, contribut-
ed 50 L. towards building the council house, and paid half of
the expence of paving the streets.  There is a weekly market
and 4 fairs, besides a tryst, established, within these few years,
for black cattle, etc. in October, between Falkirk tryst and
Newcastle fair, which promises to succeed.
