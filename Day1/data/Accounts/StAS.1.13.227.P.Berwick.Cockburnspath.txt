*Diseases-There are no diseases peculiar to this parish; argues or
intermitting fevers were formerly frequent, but are scarcely now found

animal food.  Inoculation, though frequently practised, and always with
success, has not yet become general.  The prejudices of many have
been so strong, as not to yield either to the apparent certainly of succe's,
nor to the offer of having the attendance of a surgeon, employed by the
family of Dunglass.
