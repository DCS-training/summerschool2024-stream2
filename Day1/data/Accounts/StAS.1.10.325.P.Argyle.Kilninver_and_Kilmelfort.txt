will yield a better return and pay a higher rent, in grass and
pasturage, than in raising corn or grain.  Another disadvan-
tage to the inhabitants on the west coast is their great distance
from proper markers to sell their cattle, and supply them-
selves with meal, grain, and the other necssaries of life,
more particularly fuel.  Their ordinary fuel, peats, for the
most part in the high muirs and inaccessible ground, trouble-
some in the making and casting, require much time and ma-
ny hands, and after all the drying and securing of them,
uncertain and precarious in a climate subject to great rains.
This is the principal personal service required by the land-
lord from his tenant in those parishes, and not likely to be
discontinued, as no gentleman or possessor of a farm, can keep
such a number of servants as are necessary to secure a suffi-
ciency of peats for the consumpt of his family, and day la-
bourers cannot be had.  The wise and judicious removal of
the coal-duty, particularly if it shall be joined with the in-
troduction of manufactures, will tend more to the comfort
and improvement of the highlands, than any thing that has
yet been devised.
