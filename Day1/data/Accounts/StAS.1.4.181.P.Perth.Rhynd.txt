the end of September and October.  Wheat harvest com-
monly begins about the middle of August, sooner or later
according to the season.  The average rent of land the acre,
may be about L. 1, 4 s.  The greatest part of the parish is
inclosed with quickset hedges;  but the farmers begin to
complain that they harbour vermin, which destroy the crop,
and prevent a free circulation of air, so necessary for win-
ning it in harvest.  In the hilly part of the parish, there
are about 30 acres, consisting of some wastle ground, which,
though mostly covered with heath and whins, yields some
pasture, and of several rocky hillocks, some of which are
planted with Scotch firs, in every thriving condition.  There
are beside two fields in the low part of the parish as yet
wastle, containing about 20 acres;  but they belong to two
of the principal farmers, who are about to break them up.
The land-rent may be about L. 1600 Sterling.  The rent
of the fishing may be about L. 300.  There are about 112
horses, and 400 black cattle.
