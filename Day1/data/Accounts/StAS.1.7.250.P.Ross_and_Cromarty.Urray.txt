The Orrin, running from the S. W. falls into the Connon
at Urray, and intersects the parish from south to north.
About two miles west from Urray, the Garve falls in on the
north side, which running from W. N. W. rises on the con-
fines of Lochbroom.  Thence 5 miles farther west is the
junction of the other two branches, the Meig and the Lich-
art.  The former rises on the borders of Lochcarron to the
W. S. W.; and the source of the latter is on the confines of
Gairloch to the west.-The Connon abounds in salmon and
pike.  It has few trouts, except sea-trout in the months of
July and August.  A Company from Berwick farms the sal-
mon fishing, along with several other fishings in the neigh-
bourhood.  During the spring months, and beginning of
summer, they fend considerable quantities of kitted salmon to
the London market; but are kind enough, (though against
their own interest), to indulge the neighbouring families
with a competency for their tables at 2 d. a pound.  But the
body of the people are more indebted for their support, to the
shoals of herrings, which, for the most part, appear annually
in the Frith of Beauty, at the ferry of Kessock.  They visit
us in the beginning of harvest, and sometimes continue till
February.  They are smaller and leaner than those caught
on the west coast, and therefore unfit for the foreign market.
From 14 to 22 score were sold for 6 d. in the year 1791.
They serve the adjacent parts of the counties of Ross, Inver-
ness, Nairn, and Moray.  People from the braes of Banss,
Aberdeen, and Perth shires, come to purchase them.  It is
said, that, in the beginning of the fishing, their entrails have
produced oil equal in value to the prime cost.

   Fuel, Roads, and Bridges.-Most of the estates have mosses
on the adjacent hills, yet the proprietors, in general, use
coals along with peats in their own houses.  Except on one
