sure. The sales for several years past range from L.8000 to
L.10,000, to which may be added from, L.800 to L.1000 worth
of planted timber. The average number of floats received for the
last few years does not exceed 300 of Highland timber; the aver-
age value of each float is about L.30, and the average floating
money about L.2, 15s. The floats received by the agent for
Rothiemurchus' trustees are generally smaller than those received
by the agents for the Earl of Seafield and the Glenfishie Wood
Company, and consequently do not exceed L.2, 10s. for floating
money; but the above average of the whole is very near the m`rk.

   The great post road enters this parish at the bridge of Spey, and
passes through the middle of it to Elgin. The bridge was finished
in autumn 1804, and fell in part during the flood of August 1829.
A handsome and substantial wooden arch was thrown over the fal-
len part, and the bridge re-opened on the 5th December 1832.
The mail passes daily, and there is a daily runner to Garmouth.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The church is inconveniently situated for
the bulk of the population, standing about the middle of the parish,
and consequently fully three miles distant from either extremity.
The villages of Garmouth and Kingston, containing a large pro-
portion of the population, are at the one extremity, and some small
farms together with many cottages, at the other, Few parishion-
ers are within, a mile of the church; but notwithstandhng there
are few country parishes in Scotland where the inhabitants are
more disposed to attend church, or more attached to our national
Establishment. There are not more than seven Dissenters. The
church was built in 1732, enlarged and repaired in 1799, and is
now in good condition.. The stipend, by decreet of annexation
1781, is 77 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks bear; 32 bolls, 1 1/2 peck oat-
meal at 84 1/2 stones  the boll; and L.340 Scotch. , The glebe is
twenty-five acres in extent; but the soil is ' not good, and the crops
on it, as well as on the neigbbouring fields, are fearfully destroyed
