other.  There are a good many other 'forest trees of consi-
derable size, scattered about the place; and it is furnished
with an excellent garden.  Fields and trees interspersed,
and alternately intersected by a purling brook, which runs
by the house into the sea, form altogether a pleasing
scene.  The proprietor does not reside at this place.
On this estate there is a market town on the high road
from Dingwall ang the ferry of Scuddale to Cromarty.  It
is provided with an inn; and 4 fairs are held at it through-

   The chief proprietor of this parish, Mr Forbes of Cul-
loden, whose estate here lies between those of the other
two heritors, and is known by the name of Ferrintosh, has

Thane's Lands, and made anciently a part of the Thane-

the county of Nairn, Ferrintosh, whilst their property, was
on that account, (notwithstanding the distance, and the in-

It passed from their possession, about the beginning of last
century; but its connection with that county in some re-
spects still subsists.  Hence Mr Forbes of Culloden, as Ba-
ron of Ferrintosh, votes in Parliamentary elections for the
county of Nairn.  The houses, on some parts of Ferrin-

But the oaks in this parish attain not in general to any
considerable size, and are much retarded in their growth
from not being inclosed.-Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gair-
