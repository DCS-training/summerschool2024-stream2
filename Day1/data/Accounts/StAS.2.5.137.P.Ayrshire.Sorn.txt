    There are no insane persons in the parish. There are two fa-
tuous, and one deaf and dumb. The rapid increase of the popu-
lation from 1775 to 1831, arose from the establishment of the cot-
ton manufactory at Catrine, in 1792, by the late Claud Alexan-
der, Esq. of Ballochmyle, and the late David Dale, Esq.; and the
decrease from 1831 to 1836 has arisen chiefly from the improve-
ments which have taken place in machinery, by means of which,
in some departments of that establishment, fewer persons are re-
quired. In the country part of the parish, and in the village of Sorn,
the population has varied little since the date of the last Statistical
Account in 1797. Then it was 1429, and at the end of 1836,
1418, the difference being only 11 during that period. In the
cotton manufactory, and in the bleachfield at Catrine, there are
913 persons employed, of whom 315 are males and 598 females.

    Character, &c. of the People.--The people of the parish are in
general quiet, sober, and industrious. Most of them pay outward
respect to religion, yet it is to be feared, as in other districts of the
