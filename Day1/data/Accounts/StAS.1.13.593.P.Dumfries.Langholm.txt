tions*.  In the centre of this district, There is a chapel
where Divine service is performed every fourth Sun-
day by the clergyman of Langholm.  From the increa-
sing population, amounting, in June 1792, to 614
souls, it is now too small to contain the present con-
gregation, who, in general, are not only sober and indu-
strious in their several occupations, but decent in their
manners, and regular in their several attendance upon religious
worship.  It is soon, however, to be repaired and enlar-
ged.  It is 8 miles distant from the parish-church, 2 of
which, after leaving the road from Langholm to Annan,
were, in winter, or in rainy weather, almost impassable.
This obstruction is now, in a great measure, removed by a
new road, finished this harvest, (October 1793), and by o-
thers, carrying forward by Sir William Maxwell, and the
voluntary contributions of his tenants, in order to open
a more direct communication with Longtown, a small sea-
port on the Solway frith, Sarkfoot, Gratney, and other
places adjacent.  When Halsmorton was first united to
Wauchope, it might then have been no great burden upon
the clergyman of so small a parish to officiate there month-
ly; but regarding Langholm as the second town in the
county, both in point of trade and population, containing,
in may 1792, 1516 inhabitants, independent of the coun-
try part of the parish, which then contained 417, and con-
sidering how apt people are to neglect public worship, and
other religious duties altogether, when they have so sel-

*As a proof that this is not a vague affection, in this and the two ad-
joining parishes upon the estate of Sir William Maxwell, there were, a
few years ago, 8 persons living at same time, each of whom was up-
wards of 90 years of age.  Peter Hutchison, tinker, died in Halfmorton,
about 3 years ago, who from his own account, was 114; from many cir-
cumstances, he was certainly some years above 100.
