and many charters are said to bear date from it.  Near to this place, Ed-
ward Baliol encamped his army, 31st July 1332, on the Miller's Acre, im-
mediately before the bloody battle of Duplin.  There is a stone cross, quite
entire, a good way up the rising ground (Bankhead) on the opposite bank
of the Earn, almost straight north from the ford by which Baliol's army
crossed the river, and another on the south of Forteviot, upon a rising ground,
called Dronachy, lying broken over at the pedestal, on which are many
emblematical figures.  About half-a-mile north from the first of these, a
large tumulus of cairn was opened about thirty years ago, by the people re-
pairing a road in the neighbourhood, and in it were found some coffins
formed of rough flat stones, containing many fragments of bones, and
some trinkets in various figures, of a vitrified substance and blackish colour;
and, a few years ago, some urns were dug up at the west boundary of the
parish, when the road was repairing between Invermey and Dunning.
   The ruinous buildings on the Halyhill were visited as an object of cu-
riosity, so late as the reign of Charles I.; but nothing now remains of these
buildings, and only a part of the eminence whereon they stood, as the wa-
ter of Mey, by undermining below, is continually washing away less or
more of the rubbish.  The King's Haugh, a little east from the place, still
retains the name.  Tradition informs us, that some houses in the neighbour-
hood have been built, or rebuilt, of the stones of the palace at Halyhill; and
some of these are easily distinguished by the antiquated figures cut there-
on.
   The Pleasure-green, too, the scene of ancient exercises and amusements,
is still used by the school-boys in their diversions.  The school and master's
house stand on the west and thereof.
   The Halyhill is at present only about half as big as it was 30 years ago.
