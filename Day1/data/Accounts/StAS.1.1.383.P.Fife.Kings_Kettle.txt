   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are in general cha-
ritable, and well disposed.  Both living and dress have un-
dergone a remarkable change within these 20 years, owing
to the influx of wealth, and rise of wages.  Few, however,
have proved insolvent.  Property has, in consequence, in-
creased in value, and is now rated at 29 years purchase.  A
martial spirit seems to pervade the lower ranks, who can
scarcely be prevented from entering into the army or navy on
the report of a war.  Their condition might perhaps be me-

the loom; but, on the whole, few districts in the country
have more reason to be satisfied with their present state.

   Kettle possesses very material advantages in its coal and
lime works.  Marl is easily procured.  The lands are impro-
ved and drained with facility, from their sloping direction,
and plenty of water.  It affords employment and subsistence
for the whole of its inhabitants.  The language commonly
spoken is English, with a provincial accent.  The names of
places are said to be derived from the Gaelic.

   No essential hurt was felt from the severe years 1782 nor

seed.  Whatever degree of improvement this parish has yet
attained, has almost all been given it (excepting the estate of
Wester Lathrisk) within these 12 years.  Much, however,
yet remains to be done, both in acquiring system and execu-
tion.

   There are 7 or 8 public houses in the parish, but they
