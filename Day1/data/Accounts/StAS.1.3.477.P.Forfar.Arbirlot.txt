grateful remembrance, of mutual confidence, and of future
same.

   It is reported, with much confidence, that a crown of
one of the kings of the Picts, was found in the Black-den  
of this parish, by a quarryman, about the beginning of the
present century, who sold part of it is the neighbourhood,
for 20 l.  Scotch; and the remainder to London, with a 
view to procure its real value.  But by some unforeseen oc-
currence, he and his family were prevented from reaping
that advantage, which might have been expected from so va-
luable a curiosity.-It is confidentially reported, that a road
was made through part of this parish, by Hector Boethius,
the Scotch historian, which still bears his name, though
somewhat corrupted.  It is called Heckenbois-path.

   Castle of Kelly.-Neither the period when the Castle of
Kelly was built, nor the proprietors, through a long series of
ages, can now be traced.  Tradition, however, has handed
down a circumstance, which deserves notice, viz. that one
Ouchterlony, laird of Kelly, was violently active in demo-
lishing the Abbey at Aberbrothock.  Nor is it unlikely that
he considered every religious fabric as a relict of idolatry.
And being remarkable for the activity of his zeal, he was
appointed by the Convention to carry this barbarous deed
into execution.-To describe, at large, the beauties of Kelly,
and do justice to Nature's varied charms, would require un-
common descriptive powers.  The soil does not refuse does nou-
rishment to trees of foreign birth.  At present there is in
the garden, a tree called the Dall-bound-bolly, remarkable for
its beauty.  Then exposed to the fun, and sheltered from the
chilly blast, it has grown up to full maturity.
