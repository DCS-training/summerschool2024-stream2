     NUMBER VIII.

     PARISH OF POLWARTH.

     (COUNTY OF MERSE.-PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE.-
     SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE).

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT HOME, Minister.

     Form, Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish is of a triangular form, and terminates in
a point in the east, where the four parishes of Pol-
warth, Fago, Edrom, and Langton, all meet.  It is about 3
miles long, and its utmost breadth about 2.

   Soil and Cultivation.-The soil is various; the greatest part
clay, and some of that on a tilly bed, which is best adapted
for grass; other parts of it are gravellish, and some sandy.
On the north-west there is a considerable extent of muir.-
The whole of the parish is inclosed, excepting a small farm,
and the muir allotted by the proprietor to the use of the
village, for pasture and fuel.  Above 1500 acres are in
old grass, and subdivided into inclosures of from 10 to 30
acres, all of them sufficiently watered.  There are let annu-
ally by public roup, and bring very high rents, for the ac-
commodation of those farmers, who breed more stock than
they can maintain at home.
