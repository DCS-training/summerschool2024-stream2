Of the above webs, 2830 were bleached, and in that state
being fit shirting and many important uses, the profit at
second hand is more considerable that that on the green or
unbleached.  Considering the number of weavers who are
householders, and that several among them keep 1 or 2
servants, or more properly apprentices, it may perhaps be
expected, that a third more cloth at least should be manu-

advanced period of life, that the greater part have more
or less to do of rural labour on their small possessions, and
that many quit their own employment entirely, and en-
gage with the neighbouring farmers, in the time of harvest.
It would tend greatly to promote and encourage manufac-
tures here, were a stamp-office established as at Inchture
and Meigle*.

ple, called Druidicial, meafuring in circumference about 43
yards.  A Roman camp, as described by Maitland in his
history of Scotland, which, from its vicinity to the frith of
Tay, he considers as having been one of those which, ac-
cording to Tacius, In vita Agric.  contained occasionally
both the land and sea forces.  There were abvious traces
of this camp remaining a very few years ago, which the
plough has since entirely effaced.  The spot, however, is
still distinguished, being known by the name of Catter
Milley, evidently a corruption of the words quatour mille,
meaning thereby to express either the number of troops
assembled in this fortress, or the distance of the encamp-

prentices and servants to 104.
