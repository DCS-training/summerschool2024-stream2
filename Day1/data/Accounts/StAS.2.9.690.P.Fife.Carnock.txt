                     PARISH OF CARNOCK.

            PRESBYTERY OF DUNFERMLINE, SYNOD OF FIFE.

              THE REV. WILLIAM GILSTON, MINISTER.


              I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name-IN the former Account of the parish, it is stated, that
the words cair or cairn, and knock, (of which Carnock is supposed
to be a compound,) signify "a village, or collection of houses
adjoining, to a small hill."  Anothr etymology has been given,
which, makes the name signify  "a cairn, or barrows on a hill," and
this, probably, is the true derivation.
   Extent and Boundaries.-This parish lies very compact, being
about 3 miles from east to west, and about the same from north
to south, though narrowing considerably in the latter direction.
Its whole extent is about 9 square miles, or 2260 square acres.
It is bounded on the extreme west by the parish of Culross, in the
county of Perth; on the north-west, by the parish of Saline; on
the north-east and east, by that of Dunfermline; and on the
south and southwest, by that of Torryyburn.
   Topographical Appearances.-The surface is pleasingly undu-
lating and varied ; and being well wooded, presents, from several
points of view, landscapes of considerable beauty and richness.
There is no eminence deserving of the name of a mountain;
but the Camp's Bank and Carneil Hill, which form a continu-
ous range of rising ground, are of considerable elevation, and
command extensive views of the Frith of Forth and the adjacent
country, from Stirling on the west, to Edinburgh on the east.
Luscar Knolls, or Knows, also the Clune of Newbigging, and part
of the Clune farm, which lie further north, and are somewhat
more elevated, command rich and varied prospects; and from
most of them are seen in the distance, the Ochils, Benlomond,
