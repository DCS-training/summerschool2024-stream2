   Air, Climate, and Diseases.-The air in general is clear;
but from the vicinity of the Atlantic, and the high hills which
intercept the clouds and attract the vapours, this parish and
the neighbourhood experience frequent storms of wind, and
heavy falls of-rain; but the latter is soon absorbed, and the
vapours dissipated, the soil in the lower division lying on a
sandy or gravelly bottom, with many declivities.  The frost
is very intense, and snow does not lie long upon the ground.
The climate is remarkably healthy, insomuch that invalids re-
sort to Newabbey in the summer season for the benefit of the
fine air, goat's whey, and sea-bathing.  There are no distempers
that can be called local, only the rheumatism previals much.
The former virulence and ravages of the small-pox are much a-

a light brown loam, which grows blackish in proportion as it
is richly manured, and deepens by liming.  The loam, from
6 to 10 inches in depth, lies on a fine dry gravel: some fields on

*Here humanity suggests the remark, that if other ministers
would take the trouble to perform this very simple operation in
their respective parishes, it would contribute to make the practice
general; which will hardly be the case, while the common people
consider it as a chirurgical business, and find it attended with ex-
pence.  It is to be believed, that a plain is now in agitation, for in-
structing the students of divinity at the University of Edinburgh
in the art of inoculation, which the physicians of that city ge-
nerously and humanely propose to do without putting them to any
expence.
