the fact, that the success of the upper river fisbings depends al-
most entirely on a strict observance of the Sunday's slap, is quite
sufficient to account for the deficiency complained of, so that we
no longer wonder at so few fish being now taken at stations which
were formerly more productive, but rather feel astonished that so
many succeed in effecting an entrance into the river while its
mouth is beset with such formidable obstructions.
   But this mode of prosecuting the fishery is not only thus inju-
rious to the property of the river heritors, it also tends, in no small
degree, to render the breed of this fish extinct; for, if fresh water
be its native element, (which seems placed beyond a doubt, not
only by the absence of all proof on the other side, but by the fact
of their regularly and universally frequenting it at the spawning
season, and also by the difference more or less observable, which
enables experienced fishermen to distinguish from each other the
fish of various rivers), then the high spawning-ground must be the
most eligible, and the productiveness of the ensuing season be
mainly dependent on the spawn which is there deposited; because
the upper fords and shallows, where the spawning-beds are formed,
are liable to little or no alteration by traffic and the violence of
winter-floods, so that the spawn rests there in safety.  Whereas
spawning-beds on the lower part of the river are continually ex-
posed to accidents, for, when the water is low, the passing and
repassing of carts and cattle, and the grounding of rafts and drift-
wood upon the fords must be very injurious, and when the stream
is swelled by the accumulated waters of a flood, its violence can
scarcely fail to remove the gravel with which the beds are covered,
and expose the spawn to the ravages of trout, which are known to
devour it greedily.  Sometimes, indeed, when the flood has been
high, the receding waters leave the spawn upon the bank, furnish-
ing thereby irresistible evidence of the destruction which it has
occasioned.  Every mode of fishing, therefore, which makes the
stock of salmon dependent on the spawn deposited in the lower
part of the river, where the beds are so insecure, must tend ulti-
mately to destroy the breed of this valuable fish.  But the present
mode of employing the stake and bag-nets has that effect, because,
by infringing the Sunday's slap, the ascent of the fish to the up-
per spawning-ground is in a great degree prevented.  No greater
number, indeed, may have ultimately escaped formerly than now,
during the six days of the week; but when the Sunday's slap
was observed, the shoals, which entered the river early, bad no
