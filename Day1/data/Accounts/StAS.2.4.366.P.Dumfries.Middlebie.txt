the parish of Hoddam, is considered as almost the most perfect
remain of Roman grandeur now existing in Britain; the fossae,
aggeres, and pretorium, being quite distinct. Situated on the
lands of His Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, I
trust that it will long continue uneffaced by the hand of Gothic
barbarism; and the more so, because there was originally another
camp adjoining to it, which, being on the ground of a small pro-
prietor, was dug up some years ago, and is now completely destroy-
ed. In this last, there were found many splendid specimens of Ro-
man antiquity, particularly large stones neatly cut and ornament-
ed, with inscriptions perfectly legible; but most of them have been
sold or given away, and none, I believe, exist in their native parish,
except one erected in the neighbouring garden of Mr Irving of
Burnfoot. Nor, in considering the subject of antiquities, can I
pass over in silence the tower of Blacket House, still standing, though
fast sinking into ruins, which, like several others in the neighbour-
ing parishes, is supposed to be one of those forts of defence which
were used in the wars betwixt the English and Scottish borderers.

	This increase of  population is to be ascribed to the operation
of national improvement in general, and a more scientific agricul-
ture in particular. Within these last twenty years, three flourish-
ing villages have arisen amongst us, which bid fair to enlarge their
bounds, and promote the progress of civilization. The manufac-
ture of cloth is carried on to a considerable extent, and a ready
demand is made for it in the neighbouring emporium of Carlisle.
Commerce even sheds its blessings around us. In one of our vil-
lages an enterprising gentleman has attracted the employment of
a great proportion of the surrounding population, and in particu-
lar deals in wool more extensively than any individual in the coun-
ty. The number of persons residing in our villages is 579, and in
the country part of the parish 1528.
