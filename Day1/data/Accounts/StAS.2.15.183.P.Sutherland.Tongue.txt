    tuitously transfer them to the library, and thus, while the country
    people generally are benefited by them, the members of the club,
    who are all likewise members of the library, have still access to
    them. This plan since its adoption has been warmly commended.
    The noble family of Sutherland are so satisfied of its value that
    they resolve to patronize it. The Duke and Duchess, their Com-
    missioner, and the Member of Parliament for tire county, have se-
    verally requested to be admitted members of both library and club,
    and each propose making a handsome donation to the former.
    The donation of the Duchess, consisting of 32 volumes, has been
    already received.
      Savings Banks.-There is a branch in this parish of the Su-
    therland Savings Bank, established in 1834, by the advice and
    under the direction of Mr Loch, M. P., Commissioner to the Duke
    of Sutherland. It extends over the whole county, and is divided
    into three general branches, which again are subdivided according
    to the parishes. The deposits and drawings in this parish since its
    commencement, are as follows:

       The number of depositors at present is 35, composed chiefly
    of tradesmen, servants, and junior members of families. Four per
    cent. interest is given for sums under L.20. When the amount
    exceeds this sum, only 2 per cent. is allowed.
       Poor.-Tbe average number of paupers for the last six years
    is 70. The funds for their relief are distributed yeary, and, as
    these are variable, the sum allotted to each cannot be permanent.
    The distributions to the different paupers range generally from 2s.
    to 10s., according to their peculiar circumstances. Church col-
    lections and an annual donation of L.6 from the Duke of Suther-
    land, which, united, amount on an average to L. 24, constitute
    the sole fund for their relief, at the disposal of the session. From
    this sum there are to be deducted small salaries for the kirk-officer
    and session-clerk, and disbursements for assisting in the burial of
    those who die quite destitute. It is thus evident that the poor
    are mainly indebted for their support, not to the session funds, but
