the present productions.  In most farms, likewise, there is a
great deal of outfield ground, which, after being kept for 4 or
5 years in oats, is only suffered to lie by for 2 or 3 years, and
never receives any manure, nor is properly laid down with
grass feeds.  Such, however, on the whole, is the natural fer-
tility of this county, that with a very indifferent system of
husbandry, it is able to export, in tolerable years, no less than
from 18000 to 24000 bolls of bear and meal, besides supply-
ing the consumption of its own inhabitants.  Wheat, rye, pease,
and green crops are very little in use.  Rye is almost never
sown*.

   Climate.-The climate is healthy, unless in very rainy sea-
sons, when the air is impregnated with damps, perhaps great-
er than in the more southern counties of Scotland; and when
the moist weather is of long continuance whole families are
infected with nervous fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery.  It is
a general remark that Caithness suffers much less from dry
than from rainy seasons, for most of the lands in that county ly-
ing on rock, the rain is prevented from penetrating very deep;
and the rock being covered by a stratum of clay, the soil re-
tains a sufficient degree of moisture for vegetation.  But, when
the season happens to be excessively wet, the effect must be
the reverse; the soil is chilled, and a late crop is generally
the consequence.  Snow does not remain here so long as in
the south, from the country being exposed to the influence of
the German Ocean.  On the coast, the weather is sometimes
mild and soft when there is frost in the interior parts, so that

*As a proof of the richness of the soil here, it may be ob-
served, that there are many fields, which, in the memory of
man, have never been sown with any thing but bear; with only
a sprinkling of manure each year, sometimes but once in two
years, yet have always yielded as abundant a crop as the ground
could carry.
