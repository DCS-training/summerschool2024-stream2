   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish being al-
most wholly surrounded by the sea, the shores are of
great utility, both by furnishing sea-ware, for manure
to the ground, and shell-fish at low water, particularly
in the summer months, for immediate sustenance, as
well as by the continual access to look for such other
fish as are found upon this coast.  Though carriage, by
water, may be reckoned a great advantage, to which all
the parts of the parish have access, yet the unimproved
state of the country, and poverty of the inhabitants, pre-
vent their reaping from it all the benefit that might be
expected.  This insular situation also lessens the value of
their exports and live cattle.  The small proportion of
arable to pasture land, prevents the people from living in
a collected state, in any considerable numbers; it also oc-
casions the uniting of many smaller farms into 1 large te-
nement.  So that, however great their attachment is to
their native soil, many individuals, and some families,
find it necessary to go every year for service to the Low
Country; though not a few of them return again to pass
the winter with their friends.  As the herring busses,
on their way out, frequently come to anchor in the har-
bour of Tobermory, the young men of the neighbour-
hood have the opportunity, which many of them embrace,
of hiring themselves on board these vessels, for the fishing
season.  Others go in open boats, and bring home what
herrings they can catch, or purchase, for supplying their
own families:  and the surples they fell to their neigh-
bours.  The young women are often employed in cutting
the kelp ware, in summer; and afterward, many of them
go to the reaping of harvest, in the Low Country.  It is
a pity, that a people, so well disposed for supporting
themselves, by honest industry, had not greater advanta-
ges for doing so, with more comfort to themselves.  It
