		    III.--POPULATION.
	From the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, it appears that
the population of the parish at that time was 439; but when Mr
Walker wrote his Statistical Account in 1791, the number of souls
was only 380. Since that period, however, the population has
greatly increased, partly from the erection of the village of Dal-
rymple, and partly from the subdivision of the lands of Martinham,
so that the number amounted

	Character, &c.--In a letter from Mr Campbell of Cumnock, who
was upwards of twenty years schoolmaster of Dalrymple, he says,
"you will not fail I am sure to give the peaceful inhabitants of
Dalrymple, that character for decency, sobriety, and orderly con-
duct, to which they are so justly entitled." The writer of this Ac-
count, after an eight years residence among them as their minis-
ter, has great pleasure in bearing his humble testimony to Mr
Campbell's statement.
			IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--The number of acres standard imperial measure
in the parish may be about 6700; of which 4200 are arable; 1900
consist of hill pasture and meadow; 500 are under wood, and 100
under water. The rent of land in the valley of Dalrymple is from
L. 2 to L. 4, 10s. per acre; and the average of arable land through-
out the parish is L. 1, 3s. The principal crops raised are oats and
wheat. The soils on which the wheat is generally sown, and where
it grows to the greatest advantage, are the clean clay, properly fal-
lowed; the deep dry holm land, and the light sandy and gravelly
soils after potatoes or turnips. If the ground be sufficiently dry,
it is generally sown as soon as they are taken off the field; if not,
the sowing is deferred till the following spring. Wheat in most
