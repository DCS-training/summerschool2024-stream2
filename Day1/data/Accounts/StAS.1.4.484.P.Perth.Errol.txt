furnish for the horses, are the reasons for continuing them.
Oats may be estimated at 11 bolls, and often several more;
but as they do not commonly exceed 14 s. in value, wheat
is found to be more profitable, and seldom fails to be sub-
stituted in their room, when the exchange can safely be
admitted.  Barley is a precarious crop on strong clay
ground, and cannot be reckoned upon for more than 8
bolls, though 10 and upwards are frequently obtained.
But the produced of all the above articles is subject to
much vicissitude, though the return mentioned is the high-
est that can in general be expected.  No part of the king-
dom perhaps excels this for crops of grass.  They are
raised after barley or oats, and even sometimes after
wheat; and though the increase depends a good deal upon
the season, 3 luxuriant cuttings are frequently had be-
tween the beginning of June and the end of September.
A considerable quantity of fruit is likewise produced in
this district.  Formerly there were large orchards planted
at many of the farm tenements, some of them consisting 
of several acres; and though they are in some measure be-
come barren through age, and the quality is by no means
fine, they annually bring money into the parish.
   The rearing of livestock, though generally practised, is not
carried to great extent.  The soil is ill adapted for pasture,
and too valuable to be left for that purpose.  There are
just as many animals maintained, as consume the fodder
produced on the farm.  The catttle are kept in straw-
yards with open shades, where they thrive very well, and 
are sold when 3 years old, from L. 4 to L. 6 or L. 8 each.
The milk-cows, and work horses only, have liberty to
feed on a part of the sown grass for a little time in sum-
mer, and the other stock are sent to graze in the neigh-
bourhood, or sold, excepting as many as can be supported
