power and authority committed to them, of visiting, exami-
ning, and trying all weights and measures used in buying
and selling, not only in the town, but also through the
whole county of Aberdeen, which they have in like man-

and itinerant courts for that purpose, in the different princi-
pal country towns, where any kind of trade or merchandise
is carried on.

with the whole other writs and title-deeds therein confirm-
ed, and rights and privileges thereby granted to the burgh,
were afterwards solemnly ratified by different acts of the Par-
liament of Scotland, particularly by two acts, in 1641, and
1681.
