stance of the parish being in a high state of cultivation and of
pretty uniform elevation, the field of the botanist lies chiefly in
the woods and water sides.  The following list contains plants
worthy of notice, either as regards the district or the parish.
Most of them occur on the south bank of the Doveron, and on
the richly-wooded steep, the Craig, Brae of Laithers.  The marks
are those used by the Edinburgh Botanical Society.

   To the above list may be added, as the less common species
which are found in Aberdeenshire, and which have been met with
in this parish by Mr Alexander Murray, the intelligent tenant of
Burnside of Delgaty, and well known for his botanical taste and
general information:-

   Zoology.-This parish is not distinguished by any of the rarer
species of animals.  Roe-deer are, frequently to be seen in the
woods, and during winter do much injury to the trees, by stripping
them of their bark.  Of late, since the Earl of Kintore had a
hunting-seat at Gask, foxes have become numerous; and although
occasional depredations are committed, the kindness of the Noble
Lord, and his attention to the interests of the tenantry in other
respects, with his generosity to the parochial poor, make ample
atonement for any loss sustained by the attacks of the wily enmy
of the poultry yard.  Wild cats, badgers, and some of the weasel
tribe, with mice, rats, and moles, are common, and the hare and
rabbit in very great abundance.  Grouse are not plentiful; though,
on the Waggle Hill, in the immediate neighbourhood, a young
gentleman, this season, bagged twelve brace on the 12th of
August.  Partridges are numerous; and of late, that beautiful
bird, the pheasant, has found its way from Duff House Park, or
the grounds at Fyvie Castle, and is now frequently to be seen.
   Ichthyology.-The Doveron contains salmon, trout, and the
other varieties of river fishes; and the burn of Turriff affords ex-
