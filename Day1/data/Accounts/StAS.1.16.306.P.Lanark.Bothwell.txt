     Statistical Account

   Poor.-The poor are supplied from an assessment, fixed
by a meeting of heritors and church-session, who meet once
in the six months, examine the poors roll, and appoint such
a sum to be levied for the ensuing half year, as the state of
the poor requires.  The landed property pay the one
half, and the householders the other.  As the parish is as-
sessed, the Sunday collections are small; and are applied
to keep the poor rates in moderation, to aid such as have a
small allowance, and to keep others off it, by giving them
incidental charity.  At an average, there are about 25 up-
on the roll; and the sum alotted for the current year, is
L. 73: 18: 8 Sterling.
   By the mode of Sundays collections in Scotland, the
poor are in general supported by the poorer part of socie-
ty; but a legal assessment secures the contribution of all ranks
in the parish, sectarists, and especially the opulent proprie-
tors, whether resident or not.  Its increase, however, ought
to be jealously watched, and as much as possible prevented.
The following regulations may be of use.
   To prevent any from settling in the parish, whose cir-
cumstances may soon, or immediately, need supply; or
to have an obligation from the parishes whence they come,
that they shall support them.-Not to raise the stent upon
every exigency, but to make a collection among the heri-
tors, or at the church, for that purpose.-Never to slacken
the hand of industry, by giving too early, or too much;
for this would render it a nursery of sloth and idleness.
A little exercise cheers even the languor of age, and sweet-
ens both the cup and the rest of the labouring man.  The
real circumstances of every poor person should be precise-
ly known, as representations may be biassed by favour or
influence; that when application is made, every proper ob-
ject may have the necessary relief, and no part of the pu-
blic charity shall be misapplied.-To admit no person upon
