ruption of St Magridin.  Tradition is silent regarding the occa-
sions when this was made the place of the saint's meditations; but
it was well chosen, from the noble and extensive view it commands
of streams, and hills, and vales, for eliciting thought, and giving
the freshness and sublimity of nature to the imagining of the soul
within.
  Modern Buildings.-Not having any resident proprietors, we
have unfortunately little to state on this subject. There is not a
single mansion-house.  We have but to notice the parish church.
In 1790, the old building after standing, it is said, for 500 years,
was pulled down, and the present small but neat edifice erected
near the site of the former.

<TABLE = III.-POPULATION.>

  The population at different periods has been as follows:-
		In 1755, according tO Dr Webster		318
		   1792, stated in last Statistical Account,    331
		   1801, according to the census,               300
		   1811,    do.   	do.			318
		   1821,    do.	        do.			301
		   1831,    do.	        do.			286
                     1836, private register,                            245
                     1837,    do.         do.                           256

  From this table, it appears that the population has diminished.
The principal cause seems to have been, that neither proprietors
nor tenants, some time ago, were sufficiently careful to repair or re-
build the cottages. Several have, in consequence, been pulled
down, in different parts of the parish. The evil of so small a cot-
tage population, on so great an extent of cultivated land, is now se-
verely felL And the wish at present is, on the part of the farmers
at least, to have the number of cottages increased.

<TABLE>

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is        104/7
			deaths,					1 7/7
			marriages,				1 6/7
The vast disproportion between the numbers of births and deaths
must be owing to the fact that the relative number of farm-ser-
vants (who of course, are chosen in the healthy and vigorous period
of life) is great.
