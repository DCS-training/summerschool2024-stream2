     NUMBER XLII.

     PARISH OF FODDERTY.

     (Counties of Cromarty and Ross.-Presbytery of Ding-
     wall.-Synod of Ross.)

     By the Reverend Mr DONALD MACKENZIE.

     Name and Situation.

   THE name of this parish is of Gaelic etymology.  In
that language, it consists of two words that are nearly
descriptive of its situation: Foigh-ritudh, or a meadow along
the side of a hill.-The principal part of the parish lies in a
valley, surrounded with hills, to the north, west, and south,
with an extensive opening to the east.  There the valley has
a commanding view of the town and parish of Dingwall,
which lies to the north-east of it.  The name of this valley
is Strathpeffer.  About three-fourths of the inhabitants of
the parish reside in the valley.  Besides it, there are several
small glens, which extend to some distance along the open-
ings of the hills.  All these are, however, completely insula-
ted from the bulk of the parish, being surrounded with the
neighbouring ones, and lie much nearer the churches of
Dingwall and Contin than to Fodderty.  The extent of the
valley is nearly two miles long, by half a mile broad.

   Climate.-The air throughout the parish is pure and
healthy; and there are many instances of longevity in it.
