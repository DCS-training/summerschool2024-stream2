of supply for the country.  Little or none of the money that
has been collected for that purpose, has, however, been

   Antiquities.-From the situation of the parish, it is natural
to suppose, that it has frequently been the scene of action in
the contests between the two nations.  But the particulars
of these predatory incursions, are now in a great measure lost.
One tradition, however, still remains, of a battle, said to have
been sought upon a muir in the neighbourhood, between a
party of the English, commanded by Sir Marmaduke Lang-
dale and Lord Crosby, and a body of Scots, command-
ed by Sir William Brown of Coaliton; in which the English
were defeated, and both their commanders slain.  They are
buried in Dornock church-yard.  The stones that are placed
over them, are about six feet and a half long, two feet broad
below, and raised in the middle like a coffin, but somewhat
higher; and upon the sides of these tombs are cut hierogly-
phics, like broad leaves of plants, and other antique fi-
gures, quite unitelligible.  They seem to be of considerable
antiquity, but have neither letter nor date.  A spring-well on
the muir where the battle was sought, still bears the name of 
the sword-well, probably from some of these weapons being
found there after the battle.
   There is the remains of a druidical temple, still to be seen
near Woodhead, though some of the stones, or late, have been
carried away, where about an acre of ground has been surround-
ed with a fossee, of considerable depth, calledthe stank;
but for what purpose it has been made, is not certainly known.
The fossee is now drained and mostly filled up.-There is al-
so at Stableton (now belonging to the Marquis of Annandale)
a strong square tower, built of hewn stone, vaulted below,
