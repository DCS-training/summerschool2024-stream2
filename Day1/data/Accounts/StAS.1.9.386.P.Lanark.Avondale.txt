brought from the east country in carts, which carry butter,
cheese and veal, to the Edinburgh market.  The inclosing
of the low grounds, which was begun about 30 years ago,
has banished all the sheep, excepting a few pets, entirely
to the moor farms.  The number kept upon there is about
7500, all of the old Scots breed; and the only improve-
ment which has hitherto been made in this sort of farming,
is that of keeping fewer upon the ground.  The wool, like
the pasture, is coarse, and takes about 8 fleeces to the stone,
which sells at from 5 to 6 s.  In wet seasons the sheep are
very liable to the rot.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of fouls at that time was 3551.  Mr Charles Ross,
in his map of Lanarkshire, published in 1773, makes the
population of this parish to be 3770 souls.  But he has
certainly over-rated it; for it does not contain that number
at present, though it has been on the increase since that pe-
riod.  By an enumeration made in the-years 1780 and
1781, the population was as follows:

   In the country, 336 families, 1748 persons; 60 more
women than men.
   In the town, 439 families, 1444 persons; 138 more
women than men.
   In the whole parish, 775 families, 3192 persons.

     Population in 1791 and 1792.

   In the country, 315 families, 1733 persons; only 9 more
women than men.
   In the town, 469 families, 1610 persons; 28 more wo-
men than men.
   In the whole parish, 784 families, 3343 persons.

   The diminution of inhabitants in the country is owing
to the moor farms having gone into fewer hands, and there
