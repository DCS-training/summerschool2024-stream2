<FOOTNOTE>These are the emoluments only of the teacher of the English school; the grammmar school-
    master's are not here noticed.
    These two numbers include occasional as well as regular papuers.
    No returns.

	N.B. -Under the head of parochial expenditure is included not
    only the support of the poor, but also the salaries of the session, pres-
    bytery, and synod clerks, -beadle, and frequently the precentor.
    When the expenditure seems to exceed the annual income, it may be
    necessary to mention that the deficiency is made up, as in the parishes
    of Stobo, Kirhurd, and some others, by the liberality of the principal
    heritors, through no formal record is entered. In the parish of Man-
    ner, the deficiency is made up by drawing from the kirk-session funds
    lodged in the bank, -a very questionable mode of supporting the poor.
