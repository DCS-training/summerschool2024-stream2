in the parish, small as well as great, practise the most im-
proved mode.  They have laid aside those restraints, by
which deep-rooted prejudice, in favour of use and wont,
had so long settered their forefathers.  Instead of the mode
formerly followed, of a continued rotation of beans, bar-
ley, and oats, on the best lands, that of summer sallow,
wheat, beans, barley, grass, and oats, is now universally
adopted; while the lands of inferior quality have crops
suited to their soil.  The soil in general is not favourable
for turnips; yet where it is favourable, these have been
sown, and with success.  The most part of the wet lands
have been drained, and the ridges made streight*, and
thrown into a proper size.  Two horse ploughs, of Small's
construction, are used over all the parish.
   But the most material circumstance, in favour of the
agriculture of this parish, is a spirit of emulation that was,
with much propriety, raised amongst the ploughmen them-
selves.  About 10 years ago, a number of gentlemen in
this neighbourhood formed themselves into a society, un-
der the name of the Clackmannanshire Farmer Club, for
promoting the purposes of agriculture.  One of their first
steps was to institute ploughing matches among the ser-
vants, in which honours and rewards were bestowed upon
the best workmen.  From 40 to 50 candidates have often
started upon these occasions+.  The first prize has been
always a silver medal++; and three or four smaller pecuni-

*The carse lands excepted: The ridges there are, in general, crook-
ed, and, when made streight, take a long time (say the farmers, though
with very little justice), to be formed into a proper soil.
+In 1790, the minister of Clackmannan had his glebe and farm plough-
ed in one day by forty-nine two horse ploughs:  The greatest number
ever known to start at once in this country.
