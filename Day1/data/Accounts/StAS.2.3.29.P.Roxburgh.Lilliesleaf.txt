With a proportion of oak, ash, and elm, and are in general well-
managed.  There is scarcely any natural wood.
   Rent of Land.--The average rent of the arable farms is not
easily ascertained, varying as it does from 10s. to L. 1, 15s. per
acre, English.  Leases of farms, granted four or five years ago,
being too high, must fall at their expiry, unless the prices of agri-
cultural produce shall have advanced.  Village acres, of which
there are many, have lately let at L.3 per acre.  About twenty
years ago they were let at L.5 per acre.  The average price of
grazing a cow upon arable land during the season, L.5. A full-
grown ox do., L.4; and a full-grown sheep for one year 12s.  But
upon the 2000 acres of high-lying land, one-half of the above rates
is enough.
   Prices of Provisions.--Butcher-meat is about 1 1/2d. per lb. dearer
than in Edinburgh; good fowls from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. each; cheese
about 6d. per ld. of 16 oz.; butter, 8d. to 10d. per lb. ditto.
   Improvements.--The greatest improvement in the parish would be
to lime the lands kept in tillage; but the distance being twenty-
eight or thirty miles from the lime-kiln, and the expense so great,
not less than L.5 per English acre, it is doubtful whether the laying
on of lime would defray to the farmer the expense of his outlay.
On dry land, perhaps, it might repay; but not on clay soils.  Se-
veral farmers have for some years past applied lime to their lands,
and one has extended it, though in a defective quantity, over his
whole farm, consisting of about 170 or 180 acres: and, from the
superior crops consequent thereon, it will certainly amply repay
the expense of outlay.
   Produce.--The average amount of raw produce raised in the
parish cannot be accurately ascertained.  The following statement
may, however, afford an approximation.  Taking all the arable
land presently in tillage at 2600 acres, and the four-course shift
for the data, the amount may be thus stated:
