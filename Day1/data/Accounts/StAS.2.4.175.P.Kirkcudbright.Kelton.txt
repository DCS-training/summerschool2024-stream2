Douglas, consisting of nearly 1200 well selected and valuable
volumes. Subscribers have alone the privilege of reading. The
terms of admission are L.3, 3s., and an annual subscription of half-
a-guinea. There are also a circulating library, and a juvenile li-
brary for the use of the children attending the Sabbath school.
        Charitable and other Institutions.-There are two  poor houses
in the parish, the one erected and the other rented by the heri-
tors and kirk-session. In these, about thirty poor persons, some
of whom have families, are lodged, and receive the usual allowance
of out-door paupers to spend as they please. A matron hs ap-
pointed to take charge of thd helpless, and orphan, or deserted
children. She has free apartments assigned her, and receives, per
month, for taking charge of an orphan child, from 5s. to. 7s. 6d.;
and for a paralytic or disabled person, from l0s. to 18s. per month,
according to the nature of the case. This plan is attended with
less expense, and a greater amount of comfort to the poor, than
the system of paying for a separate lodging for each.
        Savings Bank.-The Savings Bank of Castle Douglas was
opened for public business on 24th December 1840, and on 20th
November 1841, there were in 25 accounts, balances to the
amount of

	As the institution is yet in its infancy, little can be said regard-
ing its ultimate success. Hitherto that has been as great as could
reasonably be expected; and from the subjoined statement of ab-
counts and classification of depositors, it appears that a consider-
able number of individuals in those classes whose benefit it chiefly
contemplates, take advantage of the institution.
