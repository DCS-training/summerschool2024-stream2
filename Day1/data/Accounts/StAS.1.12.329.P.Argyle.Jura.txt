on the low grounds, especially in the S. end of the island, is
uncommonly rich.

   Quadrupeds, Birds, etc.-The system of converting arable
into pasture, is making rapid progress in Colonsay.  The best
part of the island is under black cattle; these are in great re-
quest among the graziers, and thought to be a very fine breed.
The breed of horses is small, and hardy, like that in Jura.
The art of abridging labour, and keeping a few good cattle,
has not as yet established itself in this distant corner.  Those
innocent animals, the sheep, are totally banished, although
there are no quickset hedges; and nature seems to have des-
tined the heath-covered hills for their use.  There are great
numbers of rabbits in the island; but no hare, no partridge,
and very few grouse.

   There are above 40 souls, at an average, in each of the
farms; but some of these being very small, not having above
3 or 4 families, the number of souls in the best inhabited
farms is very great.  The average number of souls to a farm
in Jura is 38.  A few emigrated from Colonsay to America,
summer 1792; but in summer 1791, a considerable proportion
of the inhabitants crossed the Atlantic.  Those who remain,
give out that they are waiting only good accounts from their
relations, and a proper opportunity of being transported to
