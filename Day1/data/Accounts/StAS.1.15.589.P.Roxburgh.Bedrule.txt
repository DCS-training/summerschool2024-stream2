   To those, but a little acquainted with the history of that
period, it is known, that in 1649, patronage was repealed,
by act of Parliament, and, that, soon after, certain of the
clergy were distinguished by the name of Protesters, from
their protesting against admitting those called Malignants
(Cavaliers,) into offices of trust, or even into the Royal ar-
my, in opposition to another more numerous, but, in gener-
al, less popular party of the clergy, called Resolutioners, from
their resolving their admission on certain conditions:  And,
that, in consequence of the jarring of those parties, as well
