     UNITED PARISHES OF KIRKWALL

     Situation and Name.

   THESE parishes have, for a great number of years, been
united, or perhaps never were two distinct parishes.
For a long time they have had the names which they at pre-

wall, and which forms the country parish, under the name of
St Ola, was, in all probability, a parish before the town was
built, and derived that name; but at what period, or on
what occasion, it is uncertain, from Olaus or Olave, a saint,
and also perhaps a King of Norway.  Near the center of
that parish stands the ancient burgh of Kirkwall, built in a
narrow strath, extending from the Harbour of Kirkwall, on
the north, to the Bay of Scalpa, on the south, which are
about two miles distant from each other.  The direction of
the town is in that of the strath.  It is washed on one side
by the sea, which forms the Road of Kirkwall; on the other
by a pleasant inlet of the sea, which flows by the back of the
gardens at high water: It is near an English mile in length;
its breadth is very inconsiderable; and it has only one street,
