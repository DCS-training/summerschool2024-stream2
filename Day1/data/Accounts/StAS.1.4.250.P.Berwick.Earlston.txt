fields, to which they afford great shelter.  There are also
strips and clumps of planting lately made in other parts of
it, which, when grown, will add greatly to the beauty of
the place, and be a considerable benefit to the proprietors.

   Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
numbers were 1197.  There are at present (1791) 670
males, and 681 females.  In all, 1351 souls 653 are of
the Established Church, the rest are Sectaries.  I do not
think it has increased in numbers of late years.  The farms
are now much larger than formerly.  What used to serve

diminish than increase the number of inhabitants.

   Manufactures, Agriculture, etc.-Although the parish
consists chiefly of villages, yet very few manufactures are
carried on in it.  The principal one is linen cloth.  There
are between 40 and 50 weavers looms, mostly employed

sale.  We have only one woollen manufacturer, though no
place can be better situated for carrying on that branch of
trade, than the village of Earlstoun is.  Leader runs along
the west end of it, where there is an extensive beautiful
haugh, and there is plenty of wool, if not in the parish,
yet in the neighbourhood, to supply 20 manufacturers,
though they manufactured to a considerable extent.  Nor 
can any part of the country be better accommodated with
roads.  The turnpike between Edinburgh and Jedburgh,
goes close by the west end of the village, and the great
road from Edinburgh to London, by Kelso, goes within
1 1/2 mile of the east end of it.  There are 4 mills in the
parish, which manufacture a considerable quantity of all
kinds of grain.  Besides what the inhabitants of the parish
consume, they make into meal and barley above 7000
