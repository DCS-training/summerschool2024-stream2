minister, viz. that subtenants should be allowed, provided they
be natives of the parish, or strangers who bad previously acquired
a legal domicile by three years' industrial residence. This limit
tation, by excluding vagrants, secured every good purpose of the
original stipulation in the lease, while it allowed the tenants to
enjoy the full benefit of their existing buildings. The village is
scattered and irregular; yet, as the generality of the inhabitants
possess fixed property, they are free from the vices and vicissitudes
of a manufacturing population. The number of inhabitants, at
different periods, is shewn in the following table:-

                        Village.	Country.	Total.
             1755,            -                 -             959
             1769,	  74	          854	        948
             1794,	 223	          750	        973

  The register of baptisms and deaths is not correct; that of
marriages only can be depended upon. During the last seven years
there have been 56 marriages, and, consequently, 8 at an average
every year. In this list are included those marriages, where both
parties, or at least the males, resided in the parish. During this
period, 20 female parishioners were married to males residing in
other parishes : but of these, none are included in the present list.
It were desirable that this rule should be observed, as otherwise,
the same marriage may be twice reported, where the parties reside
in different parishes.
  There may be one illegitimate birth in the parish, annually, at
an average.
  It is not probable that any great difference will take place in
the number or condition of the inhabitants, either in the village
or country. The following particulars are taken from the Go-
vernment census of 1831:-

  The character of the parishioners is decent and pious, occa-
sioned mainly by the constant intercourse subsisting between
householders and their domestics. Farmers, as well as villagers,
sit in the same apartment with the inmates of their houses, and eat
