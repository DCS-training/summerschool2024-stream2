is well attende by persons of distinction, both in the town
and neighbourhood.  During summer, many go to the wells,
or retire to the country to enjoy rural selicity.  Such as re-
main at home are frequently entertained with exhibitions
calculated to gratify curiosity, or to increase knowledge.  Play-

There is excellent ground for this purpose, and also for walk-

which injure the health, or destroy the morals of the people.

provincial towns for its size in Scotland, or perhaps in
Great Britain.  It receives, on account of its neat and
