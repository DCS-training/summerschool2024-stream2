however, of any of the rising generation, who are not now in the
course of receiving the common branches of education; the heri-
tors having generously provided means for educating the child-
ren of the poor.
   Library.-There are three libraries in the village of Dirleton,
the first the parish library, purchased by collections at the church,
consisting of 161 volumes, chiefly religious. The second, the sub-
scription library, of 121 volumes, miscellaneous. The third, of
180 volumes for the school. There is also occasionally an itine-
rating library from Mr Brown of Haddington. It is to be feared,
that they are not so much valued as they ought to be.
   Societies.-In the year 1763, a friendly society for the parish
was established, "for the support of its members under affliction,
and for the decent interment of themselves and wives." This so-
ciety continues still to prosper, having at present 140 members,
and is in possession of L. 2.50 of stock. It is open for tradesmen,
servants, and others, betwixt the ages of sixteen and twenty. It
has been attended with decidedly beneficial effects; and it were
to be desired that it should receive more encouragement from the
wealthier classes in the parish.
   Savings Bank.-There is also a savings bank in the parish, in-
stituted in the year I819. The present deposits amount to L. 290;
the number of depositors is 36: and perhaps it may be of some
importance to remark, that the class chiefly benefited by it are the
female house-servants.
   Poor Funds.-Previous to the year 1823, the poor of this pa-
rish were provided for by assessment. At that time the late Rev.
Mr Stark, the excellent and able minister of the parish, set him-
self to the task of effecting an entire change in the administration
of the poor funds, by substituting voluntary contributions in room
of the assessment. *  That system has been followed ever since,
with considerable success; in proof of which the following state-
ment of the funds, and number of the poor on the roll is given.
