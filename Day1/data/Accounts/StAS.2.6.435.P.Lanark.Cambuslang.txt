the frosty nights and sunshine days in the spring. The practice of
summer fallowing for wheat is less common than it formerly was.
The expense of preparing and sowing an acre of land in summer
fallow for wheat, in 1791 and in 1836, supposing every article to
be paid for in money, is nearly as follows.

	Cambuslang is about five miles from Glasgow. The tolls for dung
are 4 1/2d. The expense of ploighing and harrowing an acre for oats
is L. 1, 1s.; and two ploughings and harrowings for potatoes cost
L. 2. Wilkie's iron plough is now almost universally used. It cuts
a more acute-angled furrow than Small's plough; and differs from
it chiefly in having the sock covered over by the mould board, and
thus is less subject to wear and tear, and is more easily repaired.
A two horse plough weighs about 1 cwt. 3 qrs. The cost from
L.4 to L. 8, 8s. The ploughs were mostly of wood frame work
before 1810; after that period, they were all of iron--and in 1829,
cast-iron socks were introduced, and are a vast improvement. It
has been observed that agriculture never rises to perfection in a
merely agricultural country. It requires the stimulus and support
of manufactures and foreign trade. This remark is well illustrat-
ed in the agricultural districts which surround Glasgow. It is upon
it, that the neighbouring parishes chiefly depend. Glasgow is the
market where they sell every thing they can spare, and purchase
whatever they want. Nearly all the wheat, except what is pre-
served for seed, a third of the potatoes, and a great part of the
dairy produce, are sold in Glasgow.
	Live-Stock.--The number of horses in the parish is about 200, all
of which. with a few exceptions, are employed in the cultivation of
land. There would thus appear to be one horse for 26 acres at an
average; but if the 1800 acres of pasture land be excluded, there is
one for 11 or 12 acres. The horses are nearly all of the Clydes-
dale breed, and are generally purchased at the fairs at Rutherglen
and Glasgow. There are 600 cows in the parish, of which 300
are milk cows; and about three acres appear to be the average
calculation for each cow; but if we add to these 300 sheep and the
grass depastured by horses, it will diminish the amount of land al-
lowed to each cow to a considerable extent.
