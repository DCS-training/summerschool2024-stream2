   It would be improper to conclude without returning
my best acknowledgments to the Clergy in general, for
the attention they have paid to the different reuqisi-
tions with which I have troubled them, and for the
very polite and flattering manner with which they have
personally addressed themseleves to me on the occasion.
The spirit and alacrity with which they have enga-
ged in so laborious an undertaking must ever do
them infinite credit; and they must feel the utmost
satisfaction from the reflection, that they have con-
tributed to the formation of a Work, of which is
may be truly said, in the words of a respectable citi-
zen of this country*, "That no Publication of equal
"information and curiosity has appeared in Great
"Britain since Dooms-day Book; and that, from the
"ample and authentic facts which it records, it must
"be resorted to by every future Statesman, Philoso-
"pher, and Divine, as the best basis that has ever
"yet appeared for political speculation."
