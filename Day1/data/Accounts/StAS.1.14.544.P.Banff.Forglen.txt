chan, who were proprietors here:  it is now mostly drain-
ed up.  There is a know, called the Rounie Law, where
formerly markets were held, on the side of the wood of
Forglen, a little N. of the church; but none are held now,
The privilage was propably transferred to Turriff, where
are now the best cattle markets in the country.
   The cattle on the water side, by richness of the pasture,
are of a large size; one tenant in Eastside, had a plough
of 8 oxen, which would, in most seasons, have been good
beef from the yoke, and would have weighed from 50 to
70 stone, at an average; and if full fed, from 70 to 90;
and some seemed size enough to carry 100.  Now how-

are now supplied with shells from Sunderland, at 3 s. the
boll, of 4 firlots; both from Banffshire, distant 10 English
miles.  This, when used as a manure, is laid on at the
quantity of from 80 to 160 firlots the acre.  Some part
of it is brought from Streisa, Edingight's land, in the pa-
rish of Grange; and a small quantity is burnt in the parish,
with peats.  The stones are brought from Whitehills quarry,
on Lord Findlater's estate, in the parish of Boyndie.  But
this is very expensive now, and little used, by reason of
the scarcity of peats.  What is burnt with peats, must be
