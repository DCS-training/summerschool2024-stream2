     Statistical Account

   Though there was abundance of stones ready at hand, ex-
cellently calculated for building on any plan, yet to suit
the grandeur and elegance of the design, vast numbers of
large freestone were brought from the shore, at the distance
of 8 miles.  This carriage was attended with great labour
and expence, and occasioned the death of several men and
horses; and this is very credible, because at that time there
were no roads; and if there were, yet there were no carts
then in use, but the tenants behoved to carry them in loads
on the backs of horses.  In short, all things put together,
speedily effected a total miscarriage of the undertaking,
and the failure of funds, and left this piece of work as a
standing monument of the undertaker's great spirit, but of
his great folly also.  It was begun by John Sinclair, one of
the Earls of Caithness, distinguished by the mock appel-
lation of Fobu the Waster, but in what year is not known.
   The gardens of Braal should not here be omitted.  They
have the appearance of antiquity also.  They are very
large, very pleasant and beautiful, divided according to the
variety and taste required in horticulture, especially in this
country, surrounded with trees, nurseries, plantations of
wood, all of them at present in a thriving state.  Very
considerable improvements have been, and still are made
upon it by the Ulbster family, the proprietors, but far short
of what they might have been, and what so good a subject
deserves.  I have it from undoubted authority, that about
100 years ago these gardens produced a great deal of fruit,
though of late years that produce has been but trifling.  Be-
fore I close this article, I should observe, that the finest and
earliest salmon in the kingdom, and in great numbers, could
be fished every season of the year, close to these gardens,
which would be a great convenience to any family residing
there.
