   Antiquities.-There have been many castles or round
towers in this parish, two of which are yet pretty entire,
and are much visited by travellers.  There are various
opinions respecting the use they were intended for; but
the one given by the late learned Dr Macpherson of Slates,
in his Antiquities of Scotland, seems to be the most pro-
bable.  There is also situated on an eminence above the
manse the remains of an old fortification, of which Mr Pen-
nant takes notice in his Tour; besides, there is still to be
seen on the top of a rock, not far from the sea, the foundation
of an old building made up of stone and lime, and yet there
is no tradition concerning it.  There are some tumuli or
barrows; one of them being opened up not many years
ago, there was found in it an urn containing as is supposed
the ashes of some ancient warrior.

   Barracks.-In the year 1722, shortly after the battle of
Glensheal; Government thought it necessary to erect a
small fortification on the west coast, and pitched on a spot
of ground in this parish as a proper situation, being in the
direct line from Fort Angustus to the island of Sky.  From
that period till after the 1745, there were commonly one
or two companies of foot quartered there; but since, an
smaller command was deemed sufficient; and for 20 years
back there have been only a serjeant or corporal, with a
few privates.  Of the house that was formerly appropri-
ated for the use of the soldiers, the skeleton only remains,
but the officers barracks are still habitable.

   Church.-The living of this parish is L. 55: 17:
46 bolls of oat-meal, 9 stones of Dutch weight to the boll,
which at an average may be valued at L. 4l, 8 s. and 12
bolls bear, at the conversion of 10 merks Scots per boll, be-
sides a small farm annexed to the church, which may be
