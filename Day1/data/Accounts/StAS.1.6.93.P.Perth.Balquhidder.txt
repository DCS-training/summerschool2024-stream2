different possessors are industriously improving, by draining,
blowing, and digging up large stones to be used in inclosing
their different lots.  This must soon produce a different face
to these lands, and, in the meantine, gives the traveller the
pleasant idea of the progress of cultivation in this quarter.

   Division of Lands, Rent, and Crops.-There is no part of
the parish in common; the marches of each proprietor are
known, and, with few exception, the marches of each farm
are distinctly marked.  Every farm has what is called a head-
dyke, which divides the hill-pasture where the horses, yeld-
cattle, and sheep of the farm, range, from the arable and
meadow ground, and pasture of the milch-cows.  Most of
the farms are divided from each other by march-dykes; these,
with a head-dyke on one side, and the lake or river on the other,
compleatly inclose the farms: some of them are sub-divided.
The rent of the hills is from 1 s. to 3 s. for the grass of every
sheep.  Where there are sevearl small tenants upon one farm,
the farm is (what they call) foumed; which means, that the
number of cattle it can properly maintain or pasture, is ascer-
tained, that none of the tenants may exceed his just propor-
tion, nor over-stock the farm.  The rule in fouming is, 4
sheep equal to 1 cow, ad 8 sheep equal to 1 horse.  The
meadow and arable land lets from 5 s. to 15 s. per acre.  The
rent of the whole parish is L. 2600 sterling.  The extent of
the arable and meadow grounds, bears but a very small pro-
portion to that of the hills.  The crops are oats, bear, pota-
toes, and flax.  The returns from oats are very inconsiderable,
generally 2, seldom 3 or 4; of bear, from 4 to 6; of flax, about
1/4 of a stone, tron-weight, from a lippie of feed, allowing
it 200 square Scotch yards of ground.  The returns from po-
tatoes are from 15 to 20 bolls.  Most of the inhabitants subsist
for breakfast and supper upon this useful root for at least 6
