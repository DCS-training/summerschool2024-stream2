   Heritors and Proprietors.-The heritors and proprietors
are not so many as they were a few years ago.  The num-
ber, at present, is 6.  Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster is the
principal, being proprietor of much more than one half of the
parish and superior of a considerable part of it besides his
own property.  He is also patron of the parish.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The present incumbent is Mr John
Cameron, who was admitted in September 1769.  He
married 20th December 1782; is a widower from January
5. 1784; has one daughter, an only child, born 5th De-
cember 1783.  His immediate predecessors were Mr Wil-
liam Abernethy, Mr William Cumming, Mr John Munro,
who was the first Presbyterian Minister, My John Suther-
land, Mr. James Nicolson.  The stipend, in Mr Cumming's
time, was scarcely, at the then victual-conversion, L. 35
Sterling.  It was augmented in Mr Munro's time to about
L. 50 Sterling, at the then conversion.  He had only 2
chalders of victual in his stipend; yet small as was this sti-
pend, he lived very comfortably, and made a suitable pro-
vision for his family, which was numerous.  His eldest son
was the late Sir George Munro of Pointsfield.  His two
immediate predecessors, who had much smaller stipends,
and families to support and provide for, did the same also.
So great was the value of money, and so many were the
advantages of those days besides what they are now.  The
present stipend, which was augmented 11th December 1776,
is 2 chalders of meal and 2 chalders of bear, L. 600 Scotch,
and L. 30 Scotch for communion-elements.
   The manse and church, during the present incumbency,
have always been in a bad state of repair, and extremely
