     of Rafford.

   Altyre was formerly a distinct parish, belonging to the
parsonage of Dallas, and was annexed to Rafford by act of
Parliament 1661.  The walls of the old church remain en-
tire, which till of late, that Mr Cumming erected a new
tomb, had been the burying-place of his ancestors time out
of mind.  The Cummings of Logie, who are a branch of
this family, and most of the ancient residenters, still conti-
nue to bury here.  The soil of Altyre is generally thin,
but sharp and productive.  It commands a prodigious ex-
tent of hill and pasturage, and the peat-mosses are inex-
haustible.  The present proprietor has brought his farm in-
to the highest order, and observes a judicious rotation of
green and corn crops, which seldom fail to be rich and a-
bundant.  He has planted about 1000 acres, with fir and
other timber, which are advancing rapidly and decorating
the place.  The family seat is an old plain building, with
two neat modern wings, and though well fitted up and
commodious, is not suitable to that style displayed by its
ingenious owner everywhere around it.  Of late, however,
he has adopted the idea of building a new mansion, on a
very superb and elegant plan.  Here is a spacious garden,
abounding with a variety of excellent fruit and culinary
stuffs.  On the north and east it is inclosed with a high
wall, which is covered with a number of fine espaliers, con-
sisting of apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, apricots, necta-
rines, peaches, etc. all of the ragest kinds, and most exqui-
site flavour.  For some time, Colonel Cumming has resi-
ded, with his family, in Tarres, where he has a fine house
and a considerable property.

   Church, Stipend, etc.-The church is nearly centrical,
being situated about 3 miles south-east from Tarres; it
was rebuilt in 1754; and the manse in 1746.  In the times
