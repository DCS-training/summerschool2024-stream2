500 L. a year.  The average price of the whole parish is nearly
10 s. 6 d. an acre; good farms letting at about 15 s. per acre,
at an average.  The very belt may be about 2 L.; the second
about 12 s.; while the inferior kind is not worth more than
5 s. an acre.  Last year, a considerable estate here, though al-
most wholly uninclosed at the time, was sold for 5,000 gui-
neas, which was no less than 35 years purchase.  What has
chiefly contributed, to raise the price of land to such a degree,
is the now general practice of inclosing, which only commen-
ced in this district about 20 years ago, but ever since has
made the most rapid advances.  Most of the inclosures of the
parish consist of dry stone dikes, topped with a stony layer,
of stones placed upon their edges, and the whole cast with
lime.  Inclosures, consisting of ditch and hedge, likewise go
fast forward, and are paving the way for an universal emula-
tion on those grounds, which best agree with such kinds of
inclosures.-The valued and real rents of the whole district
are stated in the table.  In calculating the latter, the seus are
not included.

   Agriculture.-There is only a small proportion of the pa-
rish under grain; but that small part is well cultivated.  Dur-
ing the short space of 20 years past, the state of our cultiva-
tion has undergone very considerable improvement; insomuch,
that the ground, which formerly was let for about 2 s. 6 d. an
acre, on an average, is now rented at near 14 s. an acre; and,
even at this rate, it is thought sufficiently cheap.  There is
perhaps something in the management of the grass farms in
the parish worthy of remark: Of such small portions of them,
as are solely occupied by oats and barley, the species of grain
for which their soil is naturally adapted, the tenants are pro-
hibited from taking any more than two crops running; and
of these farms also, which are almost all arable, about a sixth
