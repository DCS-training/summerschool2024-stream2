large grave containing 50 sculls, all equally decayed, some of
them cut with the stroke of violence, belonging (it is suppo-
sed) to persons slain in some border fight, of which there
were many in this neighbourhood.  Over one of the church
doors, a man on horseback is cut in stone, killing, with
a spear, a fierce animal; it is said to be the last that in-
sested this district, when the woods were cut down.  It
seems to have been a deed of valour, as the memorial of it,
we are told, is preserved on the crest of Lord Sommerville's
arms, whose ancestors once possessed a large estate in this
parish.  It is proper to mention another curiosity in the centre
of this district; five or six stones form a circle about the size
of a cock-pit, called the Tryst:  Here the parties that made in-
cursions into Northumberland, used to meet; but when those
that came first could not wait for the arrival of their com-
panions, they cut with their swords upon the turf, the ini-
tials of their names, the head of the letters pointing to the
place whither they were going, that their friends might fol-
low them.
