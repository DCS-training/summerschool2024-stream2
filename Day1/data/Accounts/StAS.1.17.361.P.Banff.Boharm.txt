     of Boharm.

   Productions of the Parish.-Oats, barley, and pease, are the
kinds of corn principally raised.  There are fields of sown
grass, bearing, however, little proportion to the natural lie
grass and common pasturage.  Of the corn, there may be
about two third parts in oats, the remaining third in barley,
and pease, in which part the potatoe and flax may be also
included.
   The oats and pease are sown from the beginning of March,
as the season allows, to near the middle of May; and the
barley seed-time is generally completed before the 1st of
June.  The harvest begins from about the middle of August
to the middle of September.  In some years, of late, it has
not begun before the first week of October.  Its conclusion,
of course, must be at different times; and it has been, of
late, accounted early, if completed by the end of November.
   On the estate of Airndilly, if the different banks and
clumps be regarded as a whole, there is a considerable ex-
tent of natural wood, in which wild cherries, plumbs, and
geens, are interspersed.  On this estate there are also exten-
sive plantations of fir and pine, and other forest trees; and
similar plantations have also risen up on the estate of Auch-
luncart, and on the lands in this parish appertaining to the
Earl of Findlater, and which are not destitute of natural
wood.
   The black cattle among the country tenants, though not
of great bone, are accounted handsome, and of a fine figure.
The ordinary price of a yoke of oxen may be from 8 l. to
15 l. Sterling; and some have been sold at a higher rate.
A milk cow may sell from 3 l. or 4 l. to 6 l. Sterling, and a
score of wedders, with the fleece, from 6 l. to 9 l. Sterling.

   Miscellaneous.-It must be accounted a disadvantage to the
greater part of the parish, that it is so much exposed to rain
