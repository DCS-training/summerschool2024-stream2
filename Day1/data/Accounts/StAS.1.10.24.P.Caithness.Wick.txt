   Sheep.-Different attempts have been made to rear sheep
in this parish, but not with success.  They are liable to so
many diseases, with the cure of which the farmers here are
totally unacquainted, that they are generally swept off once
every five or seven years; and, in rainy seasons, whole sheep
cotts have been quite extirpated.  This discourages farmers
from rearing so many as otherwise they might do, in such

Many of these neglected but valuable animals are killed by

it, is found to be a very precarious and troublesome process,
requiring a constant regular attention; and taking up much
of a farmer's time from other work.  The seed is seldom or
