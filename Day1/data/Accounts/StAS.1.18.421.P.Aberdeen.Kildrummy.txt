   It might be thought an omission, not to mention a stone
column on the same moor.  It is nearly cylindrical, about 3
or 4 feet in circumference, and about 9 or 10 in height.
It exhibits no mark of art, and no tradition remains concern-
ing it.
   The little green mount, the only burial ground in
the parish, upon which also the church is built, has no

bones remain unburied in the bottom of the vault, the
hatchway entrance from the floor of the ayle being now im-
perfectly closed.

   It is supposed to have been the body either of the sister
