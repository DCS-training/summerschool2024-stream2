     Statistical Account

not, however, be understood that all the grain carried out
of the parish, is over and above what is consumed by the in-
habitants.  Both meal and malt are brought into the parish
from other places, and sold in small quantities to those who
cannot afford to lay in a stock.  But the quantity brought in,
bears no proportion to that which is carried out of the parish.
The vegetable produce, not included in grain, consists chiefly
of potatoes, the chief sustenance of day-labourers, and the
lower class of people.  Few if any of these are exported.
Almost every cottager keeps a hog or two, which he fattens;
and, by the assistance of these animals, the inhabitants are
enabled to consume almost the whole potatoe produce of the
parish.  A few fields are allotted for turnips.  Of late years,
a considerable quantity of ground has been laid out in fown
grass.  The quantity allotted for flax and hemp may not
exceed 12 acres.  There is one farm in the parish which it
may be proper particularly to mention, on account of its ha-
ving been lately converted into a dairy, a new thing in this
part of the country.  It is the farm of Relief; belongs to Mr
Pulteney; and is let to a person from Cheshire, who had ac-
quired the knowledge of dairy-work in that country.  Cheese
is there made of the same kind with that made in Che-
shire, and is sold at 4 1/2 d. per pound.  The butter, which is
made from the thick of the whey, is sold at 6 d. per pound.
This dairy consists of about 200 acres.  40 cows were kept 
upon it last season.  The quantity of cheese made and sold
amounted to the value of 140 L.  Sterling, and of butter to
the value of 11 L.  Last season was unfavourable; and it is
expected that a considerably greater quantity of cheese and 
butter will be made this season.  The stock of milk-cows is
also to be increased this season, by the additional number of 
ten.
