   The state of the roads, too, in this parish, may be consi-

nature.  All the statute labour, performed in the different
islands has been directed towards the building of piers, for
the accommodation of fishing boats, and vessels of an infe-
rior size.  And even these piers, it must be acknowleged, have

nor has any of them hitherto been carried to perfection.
In the county of Inverness, of which Eigg is a pendicle,
former acts of Parliament, requiring statute labour, it was
found difficult to render effectual; but it is expected, that
the act obtained last session of Parliament may have a hap-

roads.  There is not a bridge in the whole parish, yet it is
obvious, that small ones are absolutely necessary in Eigg
and Rum, as several of our waters become often dangerous,
and even impassible, by heavy falls of rains and melting of
snow.
   In this paris a spirit of discontent seems much to pre-
vail.  Many complain of their rents, and many of their
want of schools, besides other inconveniencies already sug-

and it is probable other places of the same nature might be
discovered.

pudding-rock, and that in some places connected with the
basaltic rock.  A singular instance of this is a steep and los-
