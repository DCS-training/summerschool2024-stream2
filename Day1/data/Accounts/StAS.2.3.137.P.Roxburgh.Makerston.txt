			PARISH OF MAKERSTOUN.

	PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

		THE REV. DAVID HOGARTH, MINISTER.

		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name.-ACCORDING to Chalmers in his "Caledonia," the ori-
ginal name of this parish signifies the town of Machar or Machir,
who is supposed to have possessed that portion of country which
forms the parish of Makerstoun.
    Extent and Boundaries.-It is bounded on the west by the parish
of Mertoun; on the north by that of Smailholm; on the east by
that of Kelso; and on the south by the river Tweed, which sepa-
rates it from the parish of Roxburgh. It extends in length, from
east to west, between 3 and 4 miles, and in breadth, from north
to south, between 2 and 3.
    The ground rises gradually from the bank of the river to the
northern extremity of the parish. The soil near the river is a rich
dry loam upon a bottom of gravel or sandstone; but the northern
part is of much inferior quality, being a thin clay upon a retentive
subsoil.

			II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
    Land-owners.-Nine-tenths of the land belong to Sir Thomas
and Lady Makdougal Brisbane, and the remainder (with the ex-
ception of two cottages and a small garden) is the property of the
Duke of Roxburghe.
    Parochial Registers.-These extend from 1692, with little in-
terruption, to the present time.
			III.-POPULATION.
    There appears no reason for believing that the population
amounted to 1000, at a period so recent as fifty years before the
date of the last Statistical Account; for in the same account, it
is stated that the number of souls in this parish was 165 at the
time when the population was ascertained by Dr Webster. The
distance between these two periods is only twelve years; and, as
during that interval there was no material change in the circum-
