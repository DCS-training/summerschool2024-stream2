rish, was known to have died of want, though probably it
might have been otherwise, had it not been for the liberal and
seasonable supplies given by Government, and by a very
respectable native of this parish, James Baillie, Esq; mer-
chant, of London.  Mr Baillie's munificence at this season
of sore calamity, does him the highest honour, and must
necessarily be to him a perpetual source of heart felt plea-
sure.  A public granary in Inverness would be an im-
provement of very great importance.  The Geneva gra-
nary, mentioned by the patriotic Lord Gardenston, in his
travelling memorandums, is an excellent model.  The
great disadvantage this town and parish labours under, is
from a scarcity of fuel.  The mosses in the neighbourhood
are either exhausted, or inclosed and planted.  Peats are
bought at a high price, and at the distance of 5 miles from
the most populous part of the parish.  Much of the sum-
mer is spent in bringing them home.  This is a manifest
detriment to their agriculture.  If the coasting duty on
coals were taken off, and a coal-yard kept in the town, to
supply those who are not able to lay up a store for the
winter, agriculture would be greatly benefited, several
manufactures established, to which the present high price
of coal is an insuperable obstacle, and the labouring poor
of this town and parish have much less cause to complain
of their condition.  A navigable canal, from the west sea
at Fort William, to the east sea at Inverness, would no
doubt be greatly beneficial to the country at large, but
more immediately to a very extensive tract of the High-
lands, which is now covered with sheep, and almost de-
populated.  Woollen manufactures would soon be esta-
blished, other manufactures follow of course, villages and
the chearful haunts of men insensibly arise, and population
in a few years increase amazingly, in a district, which,
