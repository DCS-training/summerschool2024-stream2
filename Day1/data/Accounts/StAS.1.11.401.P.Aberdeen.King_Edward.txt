   Village.-New Byth, which is the only village in the pa-
rish, began to be feued in 1764, on a plan similar to that of
Cuminestown in Monquhitter*.  It contains 195 inhabitants,
and enjoys the advantage of a charity school.  By feuing and
dividing the land into small parcels, James Urquhart, the late
proprietor of Byth, raised the rent of his estate nearly to 5
times what it was in 1731, when he came to the manage-
ment of it.  The valuation of this estate is only one 10th, and
the number of its inhabitants more than one 4th of the whole
parish.
