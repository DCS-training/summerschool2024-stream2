	There are several companies connected with the shipping belong-
ing to this port,-such as the whale-fishing companies, which have
among them nine Ships of from 200 to 300 tons each; and about
450 seamen, &c. employed in navigating them. The quantity of
oil from the fishing of 1833 amounted to 2020 tons; the quantity
of whalebone was upwards of 100 tons; and the total value about
L.54,000. There is also the Dundee, Perth, and London ship-
ping-company, which began its operations in 1798 with four ves-
sels of about eighty tons each. In 1801, this company, added the
Glasgow to the London trade, with two additional vessels of about
sixty tons each. The late enterprising merchant, trader, salmon-
fisher, and country gentleman, Mr John Richardson of Pitfour,
had four vessels in the Tay and Thames' trade before the pre-
sent company commenced. These were purchased by the com-
pany in 1806, the company then consisting of many of the most re-
spectable merchants and ship-owners belonging to Perth and Dun-
dee.  Since that time, the Perth trade has been carried on by
lighters; and a steam-tug is now employed to facilitate the inter-
course between the two towns. A rival company, started up a few
years ago, but it was soon lost in the one that has been so long
established and while the present company continues to serve the
public as at present, it is not likely that they will soon meet with
