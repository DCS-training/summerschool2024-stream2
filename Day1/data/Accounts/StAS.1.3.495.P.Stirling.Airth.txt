     of Airth.

   Mineral Springs.-There is a well, near Abbeytown Bridge,
called Lady-Well, which is thought to be medicinal.  Num-
bers have used it, and still use it, as such.  It is supposed to
have obtained that name, from the holy water, in the time
of Popery, being taken from it, to supply the abbacy, or Ca-
tholic chapel, then at Airth.

   General Character of the People.-The morals of the people
are, in general, good; and most of them are sober, indus-
trious, and attentive to their respective employments.  They
are particularly regular in attending Divine worship every 
Sunday, at the parochial church, and are, upon the whole, a
well-behaved and respectable set of people.
