gious were admitted to it, or what were the partlcular
rules and orders observed by them, or, finally, at what pe-
riod of time it was founded, or when it was demolished.
But from the character of the original founder, for no doubt
there were large donations made to it after him, from this
character, I say, and from the name of the house, viz. Spit-
tal, it is more than probable that it was erected and en-
dowed principally for the maintenance and instruction of
the poor religious; or, at least, that there was an apartment
for the reception of mendicants, who were entertained on
the funds of that house, as was usually the case in these re-
ligious establishments.  Circumstances also render it probable,
that the house was stripped and demolished in the reign of
James VI. or perhaps Mary.  That the number admitted to
it, and retained in it, was great, is very certain; and it is no
less certain, that the revenues of it were very considerable
also; for, besides other circumslances too tedious to men-
tion, there is one, which seems to me to put this beyond
all doubt, viz. that the church was very large and capa-
cious, being some feet broader, and several feet longer than
the present parish-church, which is among the largest in
these northern counties; as also, that there were several
houses round it, which surely were the cells or habitations
of these religious, some of which, as appears from their ve-
stiges, were large also.  Besides these, there were other
houses of the same nature, for the accommodation of the
same establishment, at a further distance; more particularly,
there was a very large one, at a place on a rising ground to
the west of the church, called Auchinarras, that is, the

pilgrims and mendicants.  Near Spittle, as it is now sometimes spelt,
there is a farm called Achachoal, or Acha Choirl, (that is, the field of
the meeting of council, or muster), where the people of Caithness, in
former times, frequently assembled together.
