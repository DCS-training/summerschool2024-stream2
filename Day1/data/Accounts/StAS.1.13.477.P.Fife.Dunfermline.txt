dikes to cast up the coal to the north, it would soon get
below the surface level, and be lost without the assistance
of the engine, which wins from N. to N. in all the seams
to the south of it.
   If a level mine were driven from the bottom of the pit,
at H. to L. it would win the upper seams to the north of
it, between the levels E. E. and H.  It also shows, that
if it were not for such dikes, the coal would soon run too
deep to be raised to any advantage.  Supposing the lowest
seam to be 100 fathoms deep at the north engine pit, then
the uppermost seam will be 100 fathoms deep at L, and
consequently the lowest seam will be 200 fathoms deep at
that point.
   The proportion will always be, according to the dip of
the coal, and the elevation of the surface towards the
north.
   The level E. E. E. would be about 40 fathoms from
the surface at the north engine pit, so that the engine
would have to lift the water about 60 fathoms and deli-
ver it into the said level, where it would discharge itself
at the lowest south point.
