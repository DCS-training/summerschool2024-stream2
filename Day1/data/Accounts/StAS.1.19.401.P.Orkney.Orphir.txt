of the smaller islands, the same kind of sea-weed is burnt
yearly.  This is generally ascribed to their proximity to
the ocean, and the rapidity of the tides; but, as there are
many similar situations, from which the same effect is not
produced, it is more reasonable to ascribe this phenomenon,
either to the peculiar nature of the rocks on which these
weeds grow; or, with greater probability, to the situation
and soil of those islands, which are so narrow, flat, and fan-
dy, as hardly ever to attract a cloud, or produce the smallest
rivulet from one end to the other; by which means the
sea-weed, being preserved from fresh-water, which is its
greatest enemy, is permitted to grow in its utmost perfec-
tion.

   Tides, Bays, Headlands, and Wrecks.-The tide, at its en-
trance into Scalpa Flow, is uncommonly rapid; but it gra-
dually subsides, until it becomes scarce perceptible.  The
course of the flood, with a little variation, is from W. to E.
There is one part of the coast, adjacent to the house of Mr
Honyman of Graemsay, where the current, intercepted by
a reef of rocks, runs 9 hours in one direction, and 3 in the
opposite.
   The principal nesses and headlands are Voeness, Toi-
ness, Bernori, and Houton-head.  The bays are, Waukmill
Bay, Smugro Bay, and the Bay of houton, all of them
fronting the S. and S. E.; in each of which, particularly
the last, small vessels may anchor with safety.
   Only two shipwrecks have happened here in the me-
mory of any person now alive.  The one happened about
30 years ago, upon the rocks of Hobbister, where the vessel
went to pieces, but the people were saved.  The other in
spring 1793, on the sand of the Waukmill Bay, where by
unloading a part of the cargo, which consisted chiefly of
flax, the vessel was got off, without receiving any consider-
