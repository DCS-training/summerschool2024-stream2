ful in itself, is in no small degree enhanced by the historical and
legendary associations which are connected with it,--a circum-
stance of which no stronger proof need be adduced than Sir Wal-
ter Scott's testimony, that to this very scenery, amidst which he
spent the latter period of his boyhood, he could trace the awak-
ening within himself of that "love of natural scenery, more espe-
cially when combined with ancient ruins or remains of our fathers'
piety or splendour," which was in him "an insatiable passion,"
and imparted so peculiar a colour to his subsequent pursuits and
compositions.  Every one has not, like Sir Walter, either a poe-
tical temperament, or a memory stored with those treasures of bor-
der lore necessary to render the gray ruin and the "storied" mea-
dow suggestive of the past; but the portions of border history or
tradition, which the rocks, and ruins, and streams about Kelso
recall, are fortunately too familiar not to place within the reach
of most men the pleasure derivable from contemplating the lo-
cality in connection with its associated circumstances; whilst the
visitor, whose associations take the direction of devotion rather
than of poetry, will find here ample food for that enviable babit of
mind, which, by connecting the idea of Deity with all the objects
and aspects of nature, causes the landscape to become tributary,
not only to the imagination, but to piety.
  Climate.--Though, upon the whole, mild and genial, the climate
of Kelso is scarcely so salubrious as might be expected from the
latitude of the place, its elevation, exposure, and distance from the
sea.  In common with all parishes which lie on the banks of a large
river, and in the trough of a valley bounded by hills, it is subject
to more than an average share of humidity.  Hoar-frost is preva-
lent during the winter months; and, at almost all seasons, a con-
siderable portion of imperfectly dissolved vesicular vapour may be
seen floating in the form of a thin mist over the bed and in the vi-
cinity of the river.  The prevailing winds are those from the west,
which often sweep with great violence down the vale of the Tweed;
but easterly winds are also common, especially in the spring
months, when the blighting easterly haar is by no means an unfre-
quent visitor.
  In point of climate, however, Kelso has undergone, in the course
of a century, a great and beneficial change.  At one period, all
the meadow-lands in the vicinity were filled with pools and
marshes; and even in the memory of many persons still living,
the beautiful meadow, to the north-east of the town, which is
