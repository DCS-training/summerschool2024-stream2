notice here. In the midst of the village are two thorn trees near
to each other; round these every newly married pair were expect-
ed to dance with all their friends; from hence arose the old song
of "Polwarth on the Green."
   Instances of longevity are not uncommon. The present incum-
bent, who has been sixty-four years minister, is eighty-nine years
of age, and is the oldest clergyman in the Church of Scotland.
Several of the parish paupers have also attained to a great age.

   Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The agriculture of this parish
is of the most approved kind. The soil is various. But the greatest
part of it is clay, some of which is on a tilly bed, and is best adapt-
ed for grass; other parts of it are gravellish, and some sandy. On
the north-west is a considerable extent of moor.
   The whole parish is enclosed except a small farm, and the moor
which is allotted by the proprietor to the use of the village for
pasture and fuel. A great deal of land is in old grass, which is
subdivided into enclosures of from ten to thirty acres, all suffi-
ciently watered. These are let annually, and bring very high rents,
for the accommodation of those farmers who breed more stock than
the can maintain at home.
   The principal crops are oats, barley, turnips, a little wheat, and
occasionally a few pease and beans. There is a considerable quan-
tity of old timber of good size, besides extensive young plantations,
which are in general very thriving.
   We here give a tabular statement of the manner in which the
whole land of the parish is occupied.
