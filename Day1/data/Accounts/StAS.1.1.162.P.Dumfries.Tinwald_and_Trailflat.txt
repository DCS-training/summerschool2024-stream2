mers are also beginning to raise cabbage.  They generally
lay out their wheat and barley fields with clover and rye-
grass, which produce excellent crops.  They in general be-
gin to sow oats about the 10th of March, barley in the end
of April or beginning of May, and wheat in the month of
October.  They reap their wheat and barley about the mid-
dle of August; the oat crop immediately succeeds; and in
good years the harvest is concluded in the southern part of 
the parish before the end of September.  The average rent
of the best arable land, except three farms, is from 15 s. to
L. 1:  3:  0 per acre; meadow 11. 15.; pasturage, not in
tillage, though arable 3 s. and 4 s.; inferior arable from 5 s.
to 10 s.  The average size of farms, excluding the three large
ones already mentioned, is about 100 acres.  There are few
inclosures in the parish, but the people are very much con-
vinced of their utility.  Since the commencement of the new
leases, land, formerly uncultivated, has been greatly impro-
ved.  The parish not only supplies itself with provisions, but
annually exports considerable quantities of wheat, barley,
oats, oatmeal, and potatoes of the best kind.  The farmers,
in general, have a very fine breed of cattle, rather above the
middle size.  Tinwald parks and shaws, consisting of about
1500 acres, are remarkable for producing the best fat cattle
and sheep in this part of the country.  There are about 60
or 70 score of sheep in the parish.  Of late, an attempt has
been made to improve the breed, for the fake of the wool,
part of which is now sold at 14 or 15 shillings per stone,
though, formerly, 7 or 8 shillings was the common price.  A
few of the Spanish Sheep have been procured, and some of
the Shetland kind are wanted.  The excellent pasture here
has hitherto been found to improve greatly every kind that
has been put upon it.  Should the spirit of improving the
wool become general, it would be a source of immense wealth
