     Statistical Account

backwards, instead of improving like other countries, since
their kings removed to the low countries, and thence to Lon-
don, might be shown by many undeniable proofs; and the
rich living, in distant places, must have the same effect.
Andersmas market, the iron works, the number of forts, the
Queen's road, the places for executing justice, the places for
horse-races, &c. &c. clearly shew this.  But these things fall
more properly to be observed, in the statistical account of the
Hebrides, and of the parishes in the western coast of Scotland,
where these disadvantages must be felt, still more sensibly*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It must be acknowledged, at the same time, that formerly,
there was much less security for the persons and the property of
the people, than at present.  Of this, a memorable instance accurs
in this very district  One of the Atholl family, (see Leslie's Hist.
p. 300) having taken Donald of the Isles; was so elated with the
exploit, that he put the figure of a man in chains, in his coat of arms.
In revenge for this, the Macdonalds made an hostile incursion into
this part of Pertshire, burnt, (as tradition says), the church of
Blair, and carried the Earl and Countess of Atholl, prisoners with
them, into the Hebrides.
