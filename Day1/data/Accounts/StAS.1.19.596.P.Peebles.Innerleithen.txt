   Mineral Spring.-The water which issues out of this
spring is of the same nature with that of Harrowgate.  In
many disorders it has been productive of much relief to
the afflicted.  To fill this account of cures performed, or
to lengthen it by giving an imperfect analysis of its water,
would be improper.  Two strong facts, which have come
to hand, and are well attested, of its sanative effects, ought
not to be passed over.  They both relate to cases of infla-
mation in the eyes.  The first is of a girl of 10 years of
age, almost blind, from the neighbourhood of Hawick, who,
by continuing to use the mineral for about a month, for two
seasons, returned home the last season perfectly recovered.
The other is of a young woman from Galashiels, with a
similar complaint, who, by staying five weeks, returned
home with the full use of her eyes.  The first could dis-
cern nothing distinctly when she came the first season.  The
last could not distinguish any object at the distance of 50
yards.  These cures, with many others, can be very well
attested.  In all disorders of the blood, its effects are highly
beneficial, particularly in cutaneous eruptions.  The want of
accommodation prevents a greater concourse of people from
being benefited by this salutary spring.  So far as that is
afforded, it is at one season of the year fully occupied.  The
short distance from Edinburgh should make it a desirable
watering place.

   Population.-The number of souls in the parish amounts
to 560.  The males, 289; the females, 271.  Average of
marriages for the last six years, 4 1/2.  Baptisms, 16.
