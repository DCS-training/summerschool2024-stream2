4 d. per pound.  There are some lobsters and crabs among
the rocks.  Some tons of kelp are made, every third or
fourth year, from the sea weed which grows upon the rocks.
Colonel Fullerton has lately built a house at the Troone, for
drying the sea-weed thrown in by the surf, and for making
kelp from it.  But, it is very uncertain, whether a manufac-
ture of this nature will yield a profit sufficient to recompense
the loss of manure.  The Colonel has two extensive rabbit
warrens near the shore; both of them very thriving.  While
the Isle of Man remained a distinct sovereignty, the Troone
was found to be a very convenient station for vessels employ-
ed in contraband trade.  The British government gave the
first check to smuggling upon this coast, by purchasing the
regal power of that petty state.  Happily the commutation
act has nearly annihilated the hostile traffic.  It must be ac-
knowledged, that lessening some duties to a certain degree
would not injure the revenue; and yet more effectually cut
up this business, than a fleet of cutters, or an army of custom
and excise officers.  Uncontrovertible evidence must convince
every attentive man, living upon the coast of Ayrshire, of
the great wisdom of the apostle, in joining those two pre-
cepts in one sentence, Fear God, Honour the King.  Smug-
gling, in its very nature, tends to weaken in the dealer that
sense which he has of lawful authority, to disturb his peace,
to injure his health, to corrupt his manners.  Must it not be
regretted, that men of aimable dispositions should be seduced
by the temptations of this trade.  Were profit and loss up-
on it clearly calculated, the balance would be much against
the profit side, putting health and peace and character out
of the question.
