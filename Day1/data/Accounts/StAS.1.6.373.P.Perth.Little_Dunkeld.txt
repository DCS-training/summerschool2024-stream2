freely offered.  There is a smaller estate upon much the same
footing.  Land is let at present at from 15 s. to 20 s. per acre;
but in some instances, whole farms have given so high a rent
as 28 s. per acre.  The rent of a house and small garden is
from 10 s. to 16 s. and a tradesman pays for an acre and a cow's
grass 30 s.  The valued rent of the parish is L. 4801 Scots, and
the real land rent (reckoning what is in possession of the landlords)
is L. 2568 sterling, exclusive of corn-mill rents (about L. 200).
This is the rent of the whole area of the parish, as each pos-
sessor of arable land has a proportional interest in the com-
mon pastures of the hills, as well as his share of the divided
pastures.  The salmon fishings on Tay fetch about L. 50.-
The whole surface, with respect to produce, falls under the fol-
lowing division.

   Roads and bridges.-The road from Amulrie to the west fer-
ry of Dunkeld was made, and the bridges upon it built, by go-
vernment.  A great part of it is too steep; and the whole was
originally marked out with very little judgement.  It has been
always kept in good repair, but much better of late than for-
merly.  The great Highland road already mentioned is a coun-
ty road, till it meets that of Amulrie at the west Ferry, where
it begins to be a military road.  The want of a bridge over
