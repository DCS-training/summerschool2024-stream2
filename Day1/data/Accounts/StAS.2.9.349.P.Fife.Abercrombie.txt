entrance (says my predecessor) is narrow, between two ridges of
rocks, the bottom rough, and thereby difficult and dangerous.
Our chief imports are coal and lime; and exports, potatoes, cured
cod, and herrings.
Ecclesiastical. State- The parish church is conveniently situated
for the great bulk of the population, viz. I the inhabitants of St
Monan's, but very much the reverse for the minister and his fami-
ly. The original parish church, abandoned to ruin these 190
years, was about five minutes walk from the manse. But when the
chapel in the barony of St Monan's came to be used as the pa-
rish church, the manse and offices remained where they bad ever
been, and hence their inconvenient distance of a full mile from the
place of worship, since 1646. The manse was rebuilt from the
foundation, 1795-6, and in 1818-19, an addition made to it, and
a complete set of offices erected. Upon either of these occasions, it
might have seemed obvious to remove the manse and offices to the
vicinity of the church. But in 1796, the aged incumbent, attach-
ed to the localities of Abercrombie, does not appear to bave
wished for a chanue, and when the enlargement of the manse and
new offices were thought necessary, in 1819, there were, from the
minority of the two great heritors, legal difficulties in the way of a
change of site, which prevented the removal, however desirabl,
from being carried into effect. Partly surrounding the manse, en-
larged as above, there is an excellent garden, most substantially
inclosed, and a good set of offices. The glebe, which is two-thirds
substantially enclosed with hedge and ditch, consists, inclusive of
the site of the manse and offices, of 9 acres, 3 roods, and 31 falls,
Scotch measure. The stipend is as follows:-
