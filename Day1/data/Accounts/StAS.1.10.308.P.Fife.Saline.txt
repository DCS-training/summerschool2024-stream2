height of the hill, from the village where it begins to rise, is
more than a quarter of a mile*.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants in whole, includ-
ing the sectaries, who do not exceed 20 or 30 persons, is
950, while the return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1285.
One cause of the decrease was the removal of a great num-
ber of cottars, possessing small tenements, which obliged them
to seek refuge in other places.  The number of proprietors
is 23, including those of the barony of Inzievar, which be-
longs to this parish quoad civilia, and to the parish of Torry-
burn quoad sacra, and excluding 10 proprietors who have
property in this parish quoad sacra, belonging to the parishes
of Torryburn and Dunfermline quoad civilia.  Of all these,
only 10 reside in the parish.  There are four freeholds; Kil-
lerny belonging to Major Aytoun; Nether Kinneddar to Mr
Haly; Hillside to the Reverend Mr Colvil; and Inzievar to
Mr Ronaldson.

   Soil.-The soil is various, in general thin, and of a tilly
bottom; some parts, however, are remarkably good, of a
loamy nature, and easily wrought.  Wheat, which is now
coming more into use, has yielded 16 after 1, beans 15, bar-
ley 20, though usually seldom more than 8 or 10.  There is

*The same gentleman hazards another conjecture of the ori-
gin of the name given to the hill, and consequently to the pa-
rish and village.  There is an old ruin near the foot of Saline
Hill, a little above the village, called Kill-erny.  Kill and cell
are known to be synonimous terms, to which the name of the
founder or saint may have been added.  Hence Kill-erny lite-
rally signifies the cell of Erny, and Saline Hill would most na-
turally obtain the name of Cell vin, or the hill where the cell
was.  In support of this, the Celtic word for cellar is seileir,
which still seems to accord with the present orthography of the
name Saline.
