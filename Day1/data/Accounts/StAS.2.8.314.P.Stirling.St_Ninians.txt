   The viper or adder is sometimes met with, basking in the sun
on banks facing the south.
   Forests or Plantations.-From its variety of soil and climate al-
most every species of tree to be found in Scotland prospers in
this parish. The specimens of the fir tribe may be mentioned as
equal if not superior to what are to be met with in other parts of
the country. The largest plantations are on the lands of Sauchie
and Touch, amounting to nearly a thousand acres. It may be
questioned if there is as much more ground under wood in all the
rest of the parish. In front of Bannockburn House there are two
silver firs, Pinus picea, remarkable at once for their size and ap-
pearance. In the same park tbere is a very beautiful and large
sweet chestnut. The ash trees in the park of Carnock are of great
size,-one of them is counted the largest in Stirlingshire. In the
woods of Touch, there are some very large old oak trees, and a
fine cedar, supposed to be the largest in Britain. We have very
little natural wood in this district; and though there are nume-
rous fruit trees scattered through the parish as well as in the gar-
dens, there is hardly in it any thing that deserves the name of an
orchard.
   Botany.-Being of considerable extent, and including almost
every variety of soil and surface, except high hills and sea shore,
this parish presents a fertile field for the researches of the bota-
nist. A list of all the plants found in it would occupy too much
space for a work of this nature; but the following comprehends
most of the rare or interesting ones that are to be met with.
