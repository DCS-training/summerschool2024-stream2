terly wages are from 2 s. to 4 s. according to what the youth
are learning.
   The present salary is very small; but there is every hope
that the good heritors, who have been so extremely indul-
gent to the parishioners in other respects, will soon augment
it to something that may be adequate to the support of so
useful a member of this society.

   Gentlemens Seats.-Of these there are none worthy of no-
tice excepting Sir William Maxwell's, which is a very elegant
and commodious edifice only finished about two years ago.
It is situated on a gently rising ground, near the eastern
boundary of the parish, and a short mile from the sea.  It
has in front, at a small distance, a beautiful lake of clear
water, surrounded by a belt of thriving young planting; as
also the old family castle, rearing its head amidst a clump of
lofty trees; while the opposite side commands a most exten-
five and delightful view of the Bay of Luce, the Mull of
Galloway, the Rock of Bigscar, the Isle of Man, and even
the mountains of Cumberland and Morn, when the weather
is clear.

   Rental and Proprietors.-The gross rental of the parish is
about 5000 L.
   Sir William Maxwell is by far the largest proprietor, his
estate being nearly about one-third of the extent, and two-
thirds of the value, of the whole surface.
   Next to him follow the Earls of Dumfries, Galloway, and
Selkirk, and a few private gentlemen.

   Church-The manse and offices are very good, being all
of late substantially rebuilt, and covered with slate; and an
excellent new church was completed about 4 months ago.
