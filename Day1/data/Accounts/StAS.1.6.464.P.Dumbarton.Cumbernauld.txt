was erected at the expence of L. 1000.  Considerable remains
of the celebrated Roman wall, called Graham's Dyke, are to
be seen in the north part of the parish, as also vestiges of the
military road running parallel to it.  Many curious antiqui-
ties have been found near them, particularly at Castlecary;
and on the rock at Croyhill, the marks of fire are still visible,
said to have been applied by the Romans for the purpose of
sostening the stone, which is excessively hard.  The great ca-
nal betwixt the Forth and Clyde passes through the north
part of the parish, near the dyke.  In the neighbourhood of
Castlecary is a pretty high water fall.
