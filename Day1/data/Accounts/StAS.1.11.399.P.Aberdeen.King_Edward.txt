may be expected, in a parish of such extent, fields of a diffe-
rent and opposite nature are not uncommon.

   Heritors, Extent, Rent, etc.-The parish is the property
of the Earl of Fife, William Urquhart of Craigton, Adam
Urquhart of Byth,-Gordon of Iden, and John Russell
and John Taylor of Balmad; all of whom, except the Earl
of Fife and the proprietor of Iden, reside in the parish.  From
an actual survey of the several estates, except that of Iden, a
computation of the measurement of which is here included,
the parish is found to contain 14,000 Scotch acres, of which
6482 are arable, 4402 moor and pasture, and 1982 moss.  On
the property of the Earl of Fife there are 550 acres of wood,
on that of Mr. Urquhart of Craigston 500, and on that of
Mr. Urquhart of Byth 84 acres, consisting of various kinds
of forest trees; but chiefly Scotch sir.  In low and sheltered
situations, the wood is thriving and of large size; but in those
that are elevated, and more exposed to the killing blasts from
the N. sea, it rises little higher than a shrub; however, under
cover of these shrubs, a second plantation makes greater pro-
gress; so that by attention and perseverance, trees of consider-
able size may be raised in places which appear the most unfa-
vourable to their growth.  The valued rent of the parish is
4098 L. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch; the present rent, including 1417 bolls
of meal, at 10 s. per boll, is not under 2285 L. Sterling.  Cus-
toms and personal services are falling into disuse, and on the
Earl of Fife's estate they are all commuted.  The heritors of
Balmad enjoy only the increase of rent which has taken place
since the year 1750, or thereabout, when this estate was sold,
by King's College; the rent which it bore at the time of the
sale continues to be paid to the said College and the school of
Fordyce.
