would of itself serve the city of Glasgow for 100 years to
come.  Upwards of 230 men are employed about it.

   Church, etc.-The parish belong to the presbytery of
Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  The stipend is
exactly L. 100, besides L. 6 for communion elements furnish-
ed twice a-year.  There is neither manse nor glebe.  The
village and barony of Gorbals, in the year 1571, were
feued by George Elphinston, merchant in Glasgow, from
Archbishop Porterfield.  There has been a burying-ground
eastward from the south end of the old Bridge, called the
Leper's Church-yard; and there is an old building, about
the middle of the village, on the east side, called the Chapel.
The lower part of it is at present occupied as the parish
school; the two upper stories are used as a prison.  On se-
veral places of the roof there are three capital letters,
S. G. E. being the initials of Sir George Elpbinston.  The 
chapel of Gorbals was under the patronage of St Ninian,
and the Leper's House was founded and endued by a lady,
of the name of Campbell, about the year 1350.  There
was formerly a prebend of Polmadie*, and there still re-
main some vestiges of religious houses in the neighbourhood.
It is probable that the bishop or archbishop might have had
his country seat there, as the ground is exceeding good, and
the situation pleasant.

   Schools and Poor.-The public school is good, and con-
tains upwards of 100 scholars, the emoluments may be a-
bout L. 80 per annum.  There are other five schools, at
each of which there will be upwards of 30 scholars.-The
poor are numerous, and are supported by the collections

* Polmalie seems to be of Latin derivation, from Pannum Dei, meaning
the Apple of God, or fine apple; and it is still remarkable for good fruit.
