   Minerals and Indigenous Plants.-On the confines of the parish
a lead mine had been wrought for many years, by means of a
level.  The 6th of the product, in bars of lead, from the
smelting mill, was the proportion allowed to the proprietor
by the mining company.  It has not been wrought for two
years back.  In several hills of this parish, there are appear-
ances of lead ore.  Cobalt, talc, asbestos, and a beautiful jas-
per, have been found in small masses, among our rocks and
mountains.  By an act of the Scoth parliament, in the year
1424, the mine was declared royal, and to belong to the
king, when 3 halfpennies of silver could be fined from the
pound of lead.  Limestone of good quality, is quarried in va-

combined with whisky, formed of old, a great part of the
Highlander's materia medica, are now gone much into disuse;
Valerian, Tuffilago, Althea, All-heal, Liver-wort, Plantain,
Eye-bright, and wild carrot are found in abundance.

was the tutelar saint of the country.  He lived, it is said,
near the well, and he blessed the spring.  On a little eminence
hard by, in a humble cot, there dwelt, about 20 years ago, a
poor old man, principally supported by the well of St. Connan.
The whole day he sat, generally at the door of his cot, ready
to give the passengers a drink from his favourite spring, for
which he received some small consideration.  It is incredible
what quantities he himself daily drank, for the space of 44
years, that he lived near the well.  He never had a complaint:
he arrived at the age of 85 or 86 years, in the exercise of
