   which the common people talk very highly, as a cure for the

   Villages.-There are three villages in the parish, viz.  Crail-
ing, and Upper and Nether Nisbet.  But, indeed, they scarce-
ly deserve the name of villages, being inhabited only by such
labourers and trademen, as are necessary for the purposes of
the neighbouring farmers.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish.-The present church and
manse were built about 35 years ago.  The church is small,
but handsome, well finished, and in good repair.  It stands
remote from all other buildings, on a small eminence near the
fouth bank of the Teviot, where the river is joined by the
Oxnam, which is about the centre of the parish.  When this
church was built, the church of Nisbet was thrown down, and
not a vestige of it now remains.  The hospital and chapel at
Spital were long ago demolished, and even the burying-ground
there has been totally abandoned for many years.  Nothing
but a few tomb stones now mark the place, and there are al-

ground at Nisbet is still used, by all the Nisbet and Spital side of
the parish.-There are no remains of the old church of Crailing,
which stood within a few yards of Crailing house; but the pa-
rishioners on Crailing side, and some also, who have left the
parish, still insist upon using the old burying-ground, although
the proprietor of Crailing has, in lieu of it, given them an am-
ple space around the new church; and although their late mi-
nister set them an example, by erecting there a tomb for himself
some years before he died.-The manse stands upon the old
site of Crailing manse, nearly about half a mile fouth from the
present church.  The king is patron.  The living consists of 85
bolls of meal, and a little more than 75 bolls of barley, Linlith-
