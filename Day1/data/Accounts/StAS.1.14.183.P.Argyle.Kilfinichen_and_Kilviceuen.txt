Grace's estate, and is worthy of imitation by the High-
land proprietors of kelp shores.  Kelp is of great conse-
quence to the Highlands in particular, and of some to the
kingdom in general.  The manufacturing of it employs
many of the natives; the price it draws brings money to
the country, which is again circulated through the

farm of Ross, called Ardtan, and in many parts of Bro-
lass, and more particularly in Inimore facing the S.
Channel.  In the last place, the rocks rise almost per-
pendicular from the sea to a great height.  In the face
of these rocks the pillars appear.  In some parts there
are 4 ranges; in others 5 ranges af small pillars appear, 
with strata of rock between each range.  The pillars
