to have diminished in proportion), it must be observed, that
those people who have left the parish, still continue to bury
their dead here, whose interments, without distinction, are in-
serted in the register, along with those of actual parishioners.
It appears, from the register of the dead, which was begun in
this parish in February 1696*, that in the year 1697, 114
died; and that of these, 76 died in the months of January,
February, March and April.  In the year 1699, 81 died; of
whom 40 in the months of September, October, November
and December.  This vast mortality is accounted for by a
dearth +, which prevailed, more or less, for 7 years in the end
of last century; at which period also, great numbers of fish
are said to have been thrown in upon the coast; of these the
people eat immediately from the want of other food, and there-
by became the prey of dysenteries, and other putrid disorders.
-The great body of the people is composed of day labour-
ers++, mechanics, and sailors.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 14 heritors in the parish,
4 great, and 10 small.  The valued rent, as appears from

quoad sacra, the valued rent of which is 889 L. 3 s. 4 d. Scotch.

   Church and Schools.-The value of the living, including a
glebe of two acres and a half, amounts to between 80 L. and 90 L.
