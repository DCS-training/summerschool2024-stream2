     PARISH OF KIRKURD.

     (County and Presbytery of Peebles.-Synod of Lothian
     and Tweeddale.)

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE termination urd is from the Celtic language, and
signifies a quarter or fourth part; hence the following
description of places at each extremity of the parish, Kirkurd,
Ladyurd, Netherurd, and Lochurd.  The length or the pa-
rish, from E. to W. is 5 1/2 English miles; and its breadth,
from N. to S. from 3 to 4.  The parish, in general) presents
a surface finely diversified; and, what is remarkable in a hilly
country, such as Tweeddale generally is, the low or arable
land bears almost an equal proportion, in point of extent, to
the high or sheep grounds.  The parish, from actual survey,
contains 6620 acres, English measure.  The soil is of diffe-
rent kinds.  Towards the small river Tarth, it is mostly
loam; in one large farm we meet with clay; but the pre-
vailing soil is gravelish.  The light soil is preferable for
crops, as the parish lies in general high, being upwards of
600 feet above the level of the sea.  Though the air is sharp,
it is pure and healthful.  Distempers are far from being fre-
quent.  Rheumatism is the most prevalent.  This is, in a
great measure, owing to the little attention that is paid to
