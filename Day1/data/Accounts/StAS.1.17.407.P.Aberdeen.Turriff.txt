the late Mr Dirom.  Farming is carried on with equal spirit
by Mr Gordon, who occupies the Mains of Muiresk, and this
is a good cause why the price of the estate was so considera-
ble.  In no estate of the parish is there a set of more thriving
and substantial tenants, than in that of Fintray; where agri-
cultural improvements, though less rapid in their progress
than in the instances now mentioned, which employ a greater
capital than the majority of tenants can command, have been
no less successful.
   The parish is accommodated with 7 corn mills, to some
one of which the tenants of a certain district, called the
sockcom or sockmen, or sucken, are astricted.  The multure
consists of three kinds; one called the thirlage, collected for
behoof of the heritor; another called knaveship, which pro-
perly belongs to the miller for working and keeping the ma-
chinery of the mill in repair; and a third called dry or ab-
stracted multure, collected for grain sold unmanufactured.
At some mills, the two first amount to 1/13 part of the produce
in meal, and the third is generally 2/17 of the grain sold, and
this is the practice generally through Buchan.  Some of the
heritors, considering the thirlage and abstracted multures as
too heavy a tax upon improvement, have allocated them up-
on their tenants, and fixed the knaveship at 1/65 part of the
grain brought to the mill and taken 4 s 6 d. on the pound of
real rent for abolishing the multures.  Besides supplying it-
self, the produce of the parish in all ordinary years leaves a
considerable surplus for exportation.  The lateness of the
harvest, and the early frosts in 1782, gave reason to suppose
that the crop of that year would be defective; but, accusto-
med to a plentiful supply in general, that deficiency was not
at first supposed to be so great as it afterwards proved.
