all times; but one year with another the quantity may be
computed at 30,000 ling, besides cod.  They carry their
fish to Glasgow in the very boats they use at the fishing,
where the ling sell from L. 5 to L. 6 the hundred.  Her-
ring has often been got here in great abundance; but the
want of salt has sometimes prevented the inhabitants from
deriying any considerable advantage from it.  It is to be
regretted, that the feverity of the salt-laws hinders the poor
people here from using any other than what is got from
the customhouse, which lies at the distance of 20 leagues;
if the Legislature thought proper to remove this grievance,
fishing of various kinds migh become a source of affluence
to the people in general, of wealth to individuals, and the
public markets would be more pentifully supplied.  They
have been at times so successful in the caraban fishing as to
be entitled to some of the premiums granted by the Board
of Trustees; they also make some dog-fish and cuddy oil,
some of which they burn in their lamps, the overplus they
sell at 7 d. or 8 d. the Scotch pint.  Some have even been
known to pay their rents with the oil extracted from the
small fish called cuddy.  Shell-fish abound here, such as
limpets, muscles, wilks, clams, spout fish, or razor-fish,
lobsters, crabs, etc. etc. but what is singularly beneficial to
the inhabitants, is the shell fish called cockle.  It is found
upon the great sand on the N. end of Barray, in such quan-
tities, that in times of great scarcity all the families upon
the island (abouth 200) resort to it for their daily subsist-
ence.  It has been computed, that the two last summers,
which were peculiarly distressing on account of the great
scarcity, no less than from 100 to 200 horse-loads of cockles
were taken off the sands at low-water everyday of the spring-
tides during the months of May, June, July, and August.
If the people made use of cockles in plentiful years, they
