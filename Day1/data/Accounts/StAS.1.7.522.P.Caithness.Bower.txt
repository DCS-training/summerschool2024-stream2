or heaps of stones, such as the Cross of Bower, the Cairn of
Heather Cow, the Cairn of Ushally, and many others, situa-
ted on every eminence in the parish, and in the country in
general.  Some make Ludgate to denote Lord's gate, and so
called as it leads to St Paul's at London.
   The Cairn of Heather Cow is surrounded by 6 or 7 circles,
described at different distances around by large stones set on
edge, and seems to be some monument of Druidical antiquity.
It is situated about an English mile south from the kirk, from
which the ground rises by a gradual ascent, till it terminates
in a round top.  On this eminence, which is the highest
ground in the parish, there is a circular building of stones,
about 9 feet in diameter, and 4 or 5 feet high, ascending by
2 or 3 steps, like a stair, on one side.  From it there is a
very extensive prospect of the country, and part of every pa-

of part of the North Sea and Pentland Frith; some of the
Orkney Isles; and the entrance into the Murray Frith at
Riese Bay.  From this hill and its environs most of the fuel
of the parish is taken; and of it there is great abundance.

   Soil and Produce.-Most of the commons in this parish are
covered with green, and may be very easily converted into
good arable land.  But, by the manner of cultivating them
hitherto in patches, and by building small cottages on them,
there is no very valuable acquisition of arable land obtained,
and the pasture ground is much diminished.-The arable land
consists of various kinds of soil, but principally strong clay
and loam, and might be much improved by draining the low
and marshy grounds.-The grains chiefly cultivated here are
bear and oats, but most of the latter; and it is believed, that
