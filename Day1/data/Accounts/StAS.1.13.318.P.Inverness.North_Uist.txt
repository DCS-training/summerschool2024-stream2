     Statistical Account

no lands to cultivate; the encouragements held out to them 
by their friends, who are already settled in that country, 
of living in a state of much greater affluence with less la- 
bour; and the facility of procuring a property for a small 
sum of money, he produce of which they can call their 
own, and from which their removal does not depend on 
the will of capricious masters.  These are the principal 
motives that determine people now to emigrate to America, 
without at all attending to the difficulties and discourage-
ments in their way, arising from the danger they must en- 
counter in crossing the seas; the expense and trouble of 
removing with their families some 100 miles from shore, 
for the benefit of enjoying the society of their friends, who 
have gone before them; the inconvenience of buying all 
their necessaries, till such time as they are enabled to live
by the fruits of their own labour, and the disagreeable ef-
fects that a change of climate may have on their healths 
and constitutions.  This contagion has not, indeed, done 
much to the prejudice of this parish since the close of the 
American war, excepting, that after a lease that Lord Mac- 
donald had of his lands lately, there were some murmur-
ings, which produced a general desire to emigrate, but 
which his Lordship in some measure removed by augment- 
ing the manufacturing fees of kelp; however, the people 
are still in such a state of suspense, that very trifling cir- 
cumstances may weigh down the scale in favour of emi- 
gration.  To put a stop to the present rage for emigration 
requires very nice management in the proprietors.  The 
old attachment between them and their people must in 
some measure be renewed; long leases must be granted to 
secure the tenants the possession of their lands for a period 
of years, to remove their apprehensions of frequent calls 
upon them for an augmentation of rent.  A melioration 
for improvements to certain extent ought to be granted,
