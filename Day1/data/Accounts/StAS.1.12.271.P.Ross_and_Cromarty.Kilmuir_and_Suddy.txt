parish is 35, too many for all the funds:  however, there was
triple this number, until the heritors and session, in July
1792, saw the necessity of striking off a great many, or rather
they struck off themselves, as the heritors and session would
admit none, but such as would sign a bond (under certain li-
mitations), to leave all they were possessed of at their death,
as a fund for the poor of the parish; the session obliging them-

Fortrose, Cromarty, Invergordon, Alnes and Fowles, for the
space of 6 miles in each direction, and the road from Inverness
to Dingwall, at the extremity of Allangrange's property, close
to Park-town of Redcastle.  There is also a road from Kessock,
leading along the shore from Redcastle, and the West High-
