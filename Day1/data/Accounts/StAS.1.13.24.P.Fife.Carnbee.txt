rising ground, there are several little hills, of a conical
form, of which the most conspicuous are, Carnbee-Law,
Kellie-Law, Gellandshill, and Cunner-Law.  Upon the
top of some of these, particularly Kellie-Law, is an im-
mensely large cairn of stones, of various kinds and sizes,
which evidently appear to have been collected with much
labour, and thrown together, probably for the purpose of
perpetuating the remembrance of some great event, or
with a view to kindle a fire upon the top of the cairn, to
warn the country at a time of public danger.  On the
south side of these high grounds, all the way down towards
the coast, you have a great extent of fine rich fertile
ground, which commonly produces most luxuriant crops of
all kinds.  The soil here, has, in general, a mixture of
clay in it; some of the fields are of a loamy nature; others
consist of deep rich black earth; and almost all of them
have a gentle slope towards the south and east.  That part
of the parish, which lies to the north of the rising grounds
above mentioned, is much more adapted for pasture than
tillage, though there are some of the lands, (those particu-
larly at Cassingray), where, in dry seasons, they raise as
rich crops of bear and oats as in any part of the parish.

   Agriculture, etc.-Two farmers, (out of 32), pay a-
bout L. 300 Sterling of yearly rent; the rest from L. 30
to L. 120.  On their farms, in whole, they employ about
248 work-horses, many of them in value about L. 20.  One
farmer lately refused 100 guineas for 4 of his best work-
horses.  Oxen are not much used here for the plough, though
the kinds they raise are large, and very fit for the purpose.
When sold to the graziers at 4 year old, of so, they gene-
rally fetch from L. 8 to L. 12.  After the month of March
comes in, the farmers here commonly carry on all their
