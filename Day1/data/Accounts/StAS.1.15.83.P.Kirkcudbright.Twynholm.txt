upon meadow and grass grounds.  Paring and burning is
in general the worst husbandry, except upon a deep mossy
soil, with a clay bottom, when so much of the moss is burnt
as to allow the plough to reach the clay, and mingle it, moss
and ashes together; then it produces luxuriant crops of grain
and grass.  Dung, the principal manure in farming, is too
little attended to in this country:  The want of inclosures
and straw yards, most of the cattle lying out in winter, are all
reasons why so little attention is paid to this valuable article.
What is collected is generally expended upon our third crop
ground, in producing potatoes and a few turnips.  One of
the three first are generally laid on ley, or ground unbroken
up; and if laid on at least one year before it is plowed, they
gradually sink into the ground, mix with the roots of the
grass, are productive the first year, and do not so soon sink
out of the reach of the plough.  Sometimes they are laid
upon a fellow, and the author has known them laid in the
month of May upon the springing corn.

   Ploughs, Crops, etc.-Our ploughs, light, drawn by two
horses, or three when old ley is broken up, without a driver,
are mostly of the English kind, with the Scotch head, which
is found to answer best in stony ground.  Though formerly
the ox plough generally prevailed, yet it was totally laid a-
side, till Lord DAER revived it, by using both oxen and heif-
ers on a farm which he is improving in this parish.  One of
the three first kinds of manure above mentioned being laid u-
pon the ground, it is sown with oats the first two years.  The
third year dung being laid upon the field, if the farmer can
procure this article, it is partly planted with potatoes, and sown
with turnips, and the rest of the field either sown with pease
and beans, or left fallow.  The fourth year, it is sown with
