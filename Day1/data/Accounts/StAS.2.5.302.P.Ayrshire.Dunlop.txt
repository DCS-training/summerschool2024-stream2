     Cheese-Dealers.--Besides the cheese produced in the parish of
Dunlop, a large proportion of what is manufactured in other parts
of Ayrshire, passes through it on its way to the consumer. Being
a convenient entrepot between the producing country to the south
and west, and Glasgow, Paisley, and the neighbouring villages, a
considerable number of persons follow the business of cheese-deal-
ers or cheese cadgers, as they are commonly called, purchasing it
from the farmers, and supplying the victuallers in the manufactur-
ing districts. Several persons engaged in this traffic have amassed
considerable property. Though not now so profitable a business
as formerly, it is still sufficiently so to induce many to carry it on.
Fourteen persons in this parish are at present engaged in it.

                      V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

	Market-Towns.--The nearest market-towns are Kilmarnock
and Irvine, the former eight, and the latter nine miles distant from
the village of Dunlop. In an opposite direction, Paisley at the
distance of 12, and Glasgow of 16 1/2 miles, are excellent markets
for the sale of agricultural produce. Dunlop is the only village in
the parish. It consists of one street, and contains at present 284
inhabitants.
	Means of Communication.--The nearest post-office is Stewar-
ton, 2 1/2 miles distant. A runner is despatched to it every day for
the Dunlop letters. The parish is well supplied with roads. The
turnpike road from Kilmarnock to Paisley runs through it for five
miles, and a branch of this road leading to Neilston, for about four
miles more. There are besides about fourteen miles of parish roads,
made and repaired by the statute labour. They are generally kept.
