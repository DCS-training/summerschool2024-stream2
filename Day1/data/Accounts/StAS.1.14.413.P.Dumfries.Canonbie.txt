     of Canoby

   Migratory Birds.- The curlew appears in the higher
situations, bordering upon Castleton and Ewes; and al-
so the plover, dotterel, and fieldfare.  In the more in-
land parts, the woodcock, bullfinch, swallows of the
different species, and cuckoo, fix their temporary set-
tlements.

   Game.- The black cock haunts the woods upon Tar-
ras:  moorfowl are found in some situations upon the
skirts of the parish; partridge, in many places; and
hares every where, in great abundance.  The Duke 
of Buccleugh, some years ago, sent out a breed of 
pheasants to stock his woods in Elkdale; and they fre-
quently make their appearance in Canoby.

   Roads and Bridges.- In no situation, within the wri-
ter's knowledge, have greater or more rapid improve-
ments been made in these two articles, so essential to civi-
lization, and the exertion of industry in every sphere,
than this parish.  About 20 years ago, every situa-
tion out of the line of the river Elk, excepting in a
very dry summer, was almost inacceptable.  Since that
period leading roads have been made on the E.  and 
W.  side of the parish, and branches carried from these
to almost every farm; and, in a little time, will be ex-
tended to all without exception; so that the various pur-
poses of agriculture or commerce can now with ease
and comfort be fully served:  The effect which this hap-
py change has produced on both, will be mentioned in the
proper place.  For making and keeping these roads in
repair, his Grace has appropriated 5 per cent. out of 
whole land-rent of the parish, and has hitherto given
501 a-year, out of his own pocket, in additon.  A
