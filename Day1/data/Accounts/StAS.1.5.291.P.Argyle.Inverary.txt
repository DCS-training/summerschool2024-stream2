to travellers of all ranks; and the description would
have been much more extended, had not the masterly pens
of a Kames and a Pennant rendered such an attempt un-
necessary.-The only other considerable river in this pa-
rish is the water of Shira, ehich glides smoothly through
the rich deep glen of that name.  Its banks are in a state
of high cultivation, and yield luxuriant crops of hay, corn,
