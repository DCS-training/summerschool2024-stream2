     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HiSTOItY.
Extent, Boundaries, 4c.-TuE parish of Anstruther Easter ex-
tends no farther than the limits of the Royal Burgh of the same
name, and has no landward district attached. It is bounded on
the west, by the parish of Anstrutber Wester, from which it is di-
vided by a rivulet; on the north, by the landward district of the
parish of Kilrenny; on the east, by the large fishing town of Cel-
lardyke; and on the soutb, by the Frith of Forth. The town is
situated at the bottom of a small bay, from the west headland of
which, called the Billyness, the best view of it is obtaindd. It has
the appearance of a place welt suited to the purposes of trade.
Theshore, though rugged and rocky, affords a sufficiently wide en-
trance to the harbour, which is commodious and safe, being pro-
tected by a natural break-water, as well as an excellent quay,
from the heavy swell occasioned by the prevalence of south-east
winds.
Climate.-Along the east coast of Fifeshire, the climate, par-
ticularly during the spring months, is generally cold, and is reckoned
very prejudicial, where there is any tendency to pulmonary disease
cases of which description are rather numerous in this place. Apart
from this,peculiarity, the climate is, generally speaking, not unfa-
vourable to health. Epidemics have not usually been' very fatal,
and during the prevalence of cholera in 18832-33, there were only
a very few instances of it in the town. From its nearness to the
German Ocean, the severity of the winter is moderated, the snow
seldom lying longion the ground; and in like manner, the keenness
of the sea-breeze produces, during summer, a refreshing coolnes
even in the hottest weather. To the same cause is usually ascrib-
