   Cultivation and Produce of the Lands.-The lands in this
parish are almost entirely arable;-and we have happily abun-
dance of the best manures.  Our farmers, accordingly, are chief-
ly employed in agriculture.  Oats, barely, hay from sown grasses,
flax, space, beans, and a small proportion of wheat, are our
chief articles of crop.  Turnips begin to be cultivated among
us. Dung, lime, a compost of earth with other materials,
and an addition of simple earth, of a different nature from the
soil of the field upon which it is laid, are the manures princi-

   A chalder of lime, consisting of 16 bolls, each of which
contains 3 sirlots, wheat measure, is, at present bought,
at any of the lime-works, in the neighbouring parish of Camp-

   The average produce of oats and barly, through these lands,
may, in moderately favourable seasons, be about 5 or 6 bolls
an acre.  And, in years of moderate plenty, their average price
in the market, is from 13 s to 14 s, a boll.  The farms are in
general small; consisting commonly of about 50 acres each.
The farmer is often proprietor, in seu, of his own farm.  The
lands may be estimated as either actually yielding, or, at
least, capable of yielding from 15 s to 20 s an acre, of yearly
rent.

Cumin, Baron of Leinzie, and Lord of Cumbernauld; and still
holds of the barony of Cumbernauld, for the payment of 12
merks Scots, of yearly sue-duty.  The privileges with which
