     of Dalziel.

Mr Hamilton holds the whole parish immediately of the
Crown, and is proprietor of about eleven-twelfths of it.
The remainder is held of him in seu.  He is also patron of 
the parish, and titular of the tythes.

   Situation and Extent.-This parish is situated in the middle
ward of the county of Lanark, in the presbytery of Hamil-
ton, and synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  It is of an oblong fi-
gure, and would be pretty regular, if it were not for a part
of the parish of Hamilton, lying on the same side of the 
Clyde, indented in it, and almost intersecting it.  There is a 
tradition, that this part was disjoined from the parish of 
Dalziel, on account of the misdemeanours of a curate, who
was then incumbent.  Why it was not restored to his suc-
cessors is not known.  It would have been convenient that 
it had been so, for the living is very small.  The whole 
length, from south east to north west, is about 4 miles, and 
the breadth about 2.  Mr Hamilton's estate, including roads, 
etc. contains 2113 Scotch acres, and the other properties
being about a twelfth more, makes the whole 2289 acres.
The distance from Glasgow is about 13 miles, from Lanark
about 12, and no part of the parish is above 4 from Hamil-
ton.

   Surface, Soil, etc.-The land is low, and the surface even
and regular, being varied only here and there by gentle in-
equalities.  It rises moderately from the two rivers Clyde 
and Calder, by which it is bounded, to a kind of flat ridge,
having always sufficient declivity to carry off the water.
There is scarcely any part of it much more than 150 feet
above the level of the sea.  On account of this, and the na-
ture of the soil, snow seldom lies here.  It frequently hap-
pens, that while the neighbouring fields lie buried under a
