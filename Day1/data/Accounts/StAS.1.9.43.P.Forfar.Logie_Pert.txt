Pert, some paying 1/8 and others 1/21 malture besides
knaveship, etc.  The whole land of Craigo is under thir-
lage to the mill of Craigo at 1/6, besides knaveship, etc.
There is no thirlage at the mill of Logie.  This thirlage,

acres have been planted here within these 10 or 15 years
past; and of these about 270 acres were inclosed and
nearly planted out the 2 last years.-According to the
best computation, there are from 180 to 190 horses
in the parish, young and old; about 740 black cattle,
exclusive of calves, about 200 of which are annually brought
up.  There was formerly a great number of sheep in this
parish; but since the inclosing of fields and sowing of arti-
