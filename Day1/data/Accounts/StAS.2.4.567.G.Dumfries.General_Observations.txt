 			   GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

			ON THE COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.

			  BY THE REV. DR SINGER,

 		     MINISTER OF KIRKPATRICK-JUXTA.

	1. IN point of situation and extent, this County, according to
Crawford's map, and to the Agricultural Survey of 1812, extends
from 55&deg;. 2' to 55*deg; 31' of North Latitude, and from 2&deg;. 39'to 3&deg;. 53'
of West longitude; being about 50 miles long, and 30 broad. The
circumference extends about 21 miles along the Solway Frith, 33
miles of low-lying inland boundaries, and 120 miles across hills
and mountains; in all 174 miles. Within this irregular circuit are
1006 square miles of land, and 10 square miles of water, in all
644,385 English acres; of which about one-fourth is in fields un-
der tillage, and the rest in water, moss, or other waste lands, woods
and plantations, roads, or sites of buildings, or hill and mountain
pasture.
	2. Dumfries-shire contains forty-two parishes nearly; for small
portions of some of these extend beyond this county. It compre-
hends the three dales of Nith on the west, Annan in the middle,
and Esk on the east; and the population of the whole was
returned, in 1755, at 39,788 souls; in 1801, at 54,597; in 1811,
at 62,783; in 1821, at 70,878; and in 1831, at 73,770;
appearing to have nearly doubled in less than eighty years.
The synod of Dumfries extends beyond the county, and con-
tains five presbyteries, and fifty-five parishes, including Maxwell-
town. The county has a general slope and aspect towards the
Solway Frith on the South, mountain ranges on the north and east
sheltering it from cold, and its inland situation, protecting it from
excessive Atlantic rains. A great proportion of the soil is dry,
