*When the Isle of Man was an independent principality, the temptations to
smuggling were so great, that all classes of people became adventurers.  Since
that period, and particularly since the duties on tea and spints were lessened,
smuggling hath gradually declined; and, of late years, through the great vigi-
lance of the excise and custom-house officers, it hath been almost entirely sup-
pressed.  In consequence of a late wife regulation, obliging all who keep public
houses, to take licences, a regulation which, in this country, is strictly enforced,
all unnecessary public houses are in like manner suppressed; the happy effects of
which cannot fail to be generally experienced.
