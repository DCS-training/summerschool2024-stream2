     of Crailing.

the ground rises gradually from the valley; the soil becomes of
a sharper, and more stoney kind, and then runs out into
sheep pasture.  On the southern boundary there are considera-
ble plantations of wood; mostly fir, except on the banks of
the Oxnam, where there is a quantity of timber, of various
sorts, along the borders of a small and romantic glen; in the
bottom of which, there is flat of rich pasture.  The river winds
through it, but occasionally touches high and steep rocks, part-
ly covered with natural wood.  At the foot of this glen, are
situated, Crailing house on one side of the Oxnam, and the
manse on the other.  This spot is well adapted for beautiful
pleasure grounds; in the keeping up, and improving of which,
the present proprietor is at considerable pains and expence.
The grounds, on the south side of the parish, are mostly in-
closed and subdivided with hedges, and rows of trees.
   The north side of the parish contains little haugh land, the
ground beginning to rise more immediately from the river.
The soil is rich and dry, sit for any crop.  On the northern
boundary, there is a considerable extent of sheep pasture, in
which, there is a beautiful green hill, called Penelbeugh, the
only one in the parish.  The grounds on that side, though
interspersed with a few clups of fir trees, are mostly open;
except towards the west, at Spital, now called Mount-teviot,
where there are large inclosures, with hedge rows and belts
of planting, and a considerable quantity of full grown tim-
ber.
   This parish is a small portion, but, at the same time, the
lowest, warmest, and most fertile, of that beautiful tract of
corn country, on the banks of the Teviot, 20 miles in length,
from Hawick to Kelso, which is commonly known by the
name of Teviotdale.
