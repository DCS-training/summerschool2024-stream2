considerable quantity of oil is made.  This fishing is the most
beneficial to the poor tenants, as it is attended with no ex-
pence, and brings not only wholesome food to their families,
but oil, which generally sells at 30 s. or 35 s. and sometimes
at 50 s. a barrel.

   The common sea weed, here called tang, is pretty general-
ly, and successfully, used as a manure for the lands.  It is
but very lately that the attention of the gentlemen of this
country has in any measure been turned to the making of 
kelp.  This article has, however, been increasing for some
years past; so that it is now believed there may be from 200
to 300 tons annually exported from the whole country.

   There are several creeks and harbours in the parish, which,
would be of high importance in many parts of the kingdom,
but are here of very little consequence.  There is an inlet of 
the sea from St Magnus Bay, through a place called the Minn,

parish, from Mickle Rhoe in this parish.  This inlet or voe

Voeter, and Alnafirth.  In all of these there is safe anchorage
for vessels of a considerable burden; as also at Elwick and
Mavinsgrind, both at the head of Sulom Voe, which divides
this parish from Northmaving.  If a canal was cut from the 
head of Sulom Voe to Busta Voe, which could be done at a 
very moderate expence, it would open an easy communication
between all the most considerable fishing stations in the coun-
try, and afford a safe navigation to ships of any size through
the middle of the country.  If ever such a canal should be
cut, the banks of it would be a most convenient situation
for a manufacturing village, which is not more wanted in any
part of his Majesty's dominions than here:  For, during one
