first year.  It is heavier, and the same quantity of conse-
quence goes farther as food.  It stands the severest frost
without injury, and in February, March, and April, never
fails to be in found order for use.  The foliage makes a
good substitute for greens to the table, till the plant flowers
in the second year, and even after it has shot, the root re-
mains solid and palatable.  Last winter (1797-8) the com-
piler of this paper pulled a number of these turnips, and left
them exposed in the open air till the month of March, and
found them perfectly uninjured.  What were allowed to
remain in the ground threw out a luxuriant foliage early,
and the roots, even till the beginning of May, retained their
firmness and taste.
   Mangel-wurzel, or root of scarcity, promises also to be a
useful green crop.  It is a variety of the garden beet, but
preferable to them as an article of food for cattle.  Last sea-
son a quantity of the seed of this plant was sown in drills.
In the middle of these, a single drill of red beet, and another
of white beet, was planted, and it was evident that they and
the mangel-wurzel were plants of the same class.  The
leaves of the latter were cut four times in the course of the
season, and were most greedily devoured both by pigs and
milch-cows.  In autumn, the roots, though less than those
of such as had not been cut at all, were still of considerable
size.  They do not stand a severe frost.
   Red yams, which yield large crops in almost every soil,
and in all climates, ought to be tried.  If planted in April,
they may be raised in October Cattle eat them with such
voracity, that it is not safe to give them a full feed of them
at once.  Cow-feeders, in Edinburgh, prefer them to almost
every other food for their milch-cows.
   Potatoes it is unnecessary to recommend.  Their value is
already fully felt.  It may be hinted, however, that the
