ed: but when it is considered that the lands are now cultivat-
ed to much better purpose than formerly, that they are doubly
fruitful, and that wherever a family is possessed of a few
acres only, even the necessaries of life must be procured
with difficulty; when to this it is added, that such persons
find no worse subsistence as day-labourers, than as tenants of
what do not merit the name of farms, it must be owned,
that the method which is now almost universally adopted, of
having fewer tenants, but larger farms, is of advantage to
the country, while it is attended with no permanent loss to
any individual.
   Better houses are also obtained, than could be expected
were the farm to consist of little more than twelve or twenty
acres.  And this must uniformly be the case, wherever farms
are extensive, and let to substantial tenants; as when one
farm-house only is required, where three or four perhaps
were formerly necessary, the farmer will be better accommo-
dated, in every respect, in a style of elegance unknown in
former times, and with less expence to the landlord.
   Dr Moir of Leckie, whose lands are situated eastward of
Boquhan, has also commenced a plan of improvement, in the
dry fields, by inclosing and planting such spots of ground, as
are but little adapted to cultivation.  When the gentleman,
whom he lately succeeded, came to the estate, it was incum-
bered with heavy debts.  He instantly resolved, that his in-
come whatever it might be, should exceed his expenditure,
until he gave every one his own.  He lived long enough to
see his laudable purpose fulfilled.  The plan he had laid
down, however, made him unwilling to engage in any expen-
sive scheme of improvement; and when the period at length
arrived, which brought him the accomplishment of his wishes,
he was then so far advanced in life, as to find no enjoyment
in pursuits which require all the vigour and activity of youth.
