bout 50,000 may be the average number of yards annually
wove in the parish.  The cloth sells at about 8 1/2 d. per yard.
Considerable quantities of household cloth, and some Hefsian
stuffs are also wove in the district.-There was formerly a
stamp-office for stamping cloth in the village.  This was discon-
tinued for some years, but was again established in 1785.  The
following abstract was taken from the books, containing the
number of yards stamped for the last 8 years; and refers not
only to the cloth wove in the parish of Blair-Gowrie, but al-
so to what comes from the neighbouring parishes, as well as
to what is whitened at the bleach-field.

   State of Property, Inclosures, etc.-There are 22 heritors,
and a great many feuers in the village of Blair-Gowrie.  Only
one of the greater heritors resides in the perish.  Many of
them are possessed of considerable estates in other parishes.
Most of the smaller proprietors reside upon, and farm part of
their own property.  The real rent cannot, therefore, be easily

and some of it 30 s. per acre.  The land around the village

is not known, as part of it has not been measured.  Some
progress has been made in inclosing, within these 6 years, but
