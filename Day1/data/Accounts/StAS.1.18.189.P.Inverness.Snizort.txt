     of Snizort.

   Kelp.-The quantity of kelp manufactured here is not con-
siderable, being only about fifty tons yearly, and this on the
west shores alone; those on the east are bold, deep, and
of difficult access, and yield no ware for making kelp.
   There are some fresh water lochs, a few of which abound
in fine large red trout.

   Herring Fishery.-Considerable quantities of herring have
visited Loch Snizort for some years past, commonly in the month
of August, where many of the herring busses have been pret-
ty successful, but the country people, from the difficulty of
procuring salt, have not reaped from it the advantages they
might receive, were the salt laws such as to allow them to fur-
nish themselves at an easier and cheaper rate.
   The fuel used through this whole district is peats; they
are cut from the moss, chiefly in the month of May, and
when the summer is wet, the inhabitants are commonly very
ill supplied.
