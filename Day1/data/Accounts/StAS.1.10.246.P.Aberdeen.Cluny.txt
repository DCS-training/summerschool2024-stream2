ground, with all manner of forrest and ornamental trees, be-
sides many detached clumps upon different eminences, which
greatly decorate his estate.  But the most valuable and substan-
tial improvement about Cluny, is a large and beautiful mea-
dow of 100 acres; great part of which was formerly overflowed,
and, being a marsh, was a defence to the castle, but is now
perfectly dry, and fit for tillage.  Mr Gordon has also inclos-
ed several parts of his estate which he has set to tenants.
Miss Frazer, who by the death of her brother, has lately suc-

sive hill near her house, which, besides its usefulness, will be
an ornament not only to Castle Frazer, but to the whole
country.

Sterlings, besides 2 L. 15 s. for the half of the glebe of Kin-
earny, 11 bolls and a half of bear, 52 bolls and one lippie

stipend is less than formerly, owing to the decrease of sub-
tenants and of the viccarage, tithes payable out of Kinearny,
which have dwindled from 5 L. annually to less than 2 L. and
will still decrease more, as inclosing, which begins to be car-
ried on, banishes sheep; at the same time, that viccarage
tithes are not only disagreeable to the people, but obviously
