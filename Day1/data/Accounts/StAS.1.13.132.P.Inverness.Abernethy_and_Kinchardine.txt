found above ground, particularly after thaws or floods,
which wash off the surface, but when examined, seldom

the parish, occasion much cold and frost.  Cairngorm is
seldom free of some snow any time in summer.  On the
tops of these high mountains, there is very little pasture,
but a downy foggy cover on the rocks.  The sir-woods ne-

regions of cold.  Cairngorm commands an extensive view.
Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, are seen from it.

   Woods, and the Progress of Manufacture.-Besides a
great deal of birch and alder, there are two very large
sir-woods in these parishess, almost meeting in one place.
The sir-wood of Abernethy, belonging to Sir James

and early method of making deals, was by splitting the
