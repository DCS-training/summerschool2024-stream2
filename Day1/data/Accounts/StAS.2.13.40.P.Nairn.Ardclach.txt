       church-yard or burying-ground, which lies in a deep valley or
       haugh on the north side of the Findhorn, at some little distance
       above the bridge of Fairness.  The situation, on the whole, is
       perhaps the most convenient that could be chosen.  Its distance
       from the extremity of the parish, on the north, is about five-and-a-
       half miles; on the south, eight miles; on the west, eight miles;
       and, on the east, also eight miles; the extreme point on the east
       being on the lands of Sir W. Cumming and Major Cumming
       Bruce, which lay stretched beyond the rest of the parish, near
       the confines of Knockando, and have tire parish of Edenkillie interjected
       between them and the rest of Ardclach.  The church
       was built in 1626, rebuilt in 1762, and again rebuilt in 1839, at
       a cost of above L.500. It affords accommodation for 686 sitters.
       The present manse was built in 1744; repaired, and an addition
       made to it in 1816; and again repaired in 1841.  The extent of
       the grebe is 7 1/2 acres, and the annnual value of it L.5.
         The present stipend was modified in 1816, (decree dated 4th
       July 1821), and amounts to 14 chalders victual, half meal half
       barle standard measure, with L.8, 6s. 8d.  Sterling, for communion
       elements.  In the course of the Locality which followed upon
       the augmentation of 1816, the Nairnshire barley firlot was more
       than once experimented upon, with great care and precision,
       by the late Professor Leslie, under the orders of the Court of
       Teinds, and was found to be precisely 41 per centum larger than
       the Linlithgow or standard firlot.
         The gradual advance of the stipend of the parish during the last
       two centuries affords a curious picture of its progress.  When the
       two parishes of Ardclach and Edenkillie were united by the Teind
       Commissioners, on 14th July 1618, the stipend of 11 the minister
       serving the cure at the united kirks" was fixed at 520 merks
       Scots or L.28, 17s 9 4/18 d. Sterling.  This continued till 1650,
       when the united parishes were again dijoined, the present parish
       of Ardelach erected, and a stipend granted to its minister of 2
       chalders of victual, 400 merks Scots, or L.22, 4s. 5 4/18d. Sterling
       moneys, and L. 50 Scots, or L. 4, 3s.  Ad.  Sterling, for comminunion
       elements.  This stipend contioued till 1732, upwards
       et eighty years ;. but, in that year, a process of augmentation
       was brought,  in which the then real rent of the whole parish was
       proved to  be L. 2670, Is. 4d. Scots, or only L. 222 10s. 1 1/18 d.
       Sterling, and 31 bolls 3 pecks victual; and (by decree dated 16th
       February 1732) the stipend was augnientod W 31bolls 3 pecks
