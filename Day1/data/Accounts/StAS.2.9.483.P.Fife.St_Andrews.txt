cent donor, entertained the idea that the greatest boon he could
confer upon it was to adopt measures for the more effectual diffu-
sion of the said system within its limits ; and that, for promoting
this object, one-twelfth share. of the sums so transferred, after set-
ting apart a specified sum to defray all expenses should be trans_
ferred by the trustees to the provost, magistrates, and town-coun-
cil of each of the five cities or towns, viz. Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Leitb, Aberdeen, and Inverness, on the condition that it should
be held by them and their successors in office for ever, and that
the annual produce thereof should be employed in founding and
maintaining schools in each of the said towns, for the instruction
of children in the ordinary branches of education, upon the sys-
tem of mutual instruction and moral discipline exemplified in the
Madras school. That a twelfth share should be transferred to the
trustees of the Royal Naval School, entablisbed for the education
of children of officers in the navy, on the same condition and for
the same purpose. That another twelfth share should be trans-
ferred to the provost, magistrates, and town-council of St An-
drews, so as to become a permanent fund for the moral andi reli-
gious improvement ofthe city; and for such other useful and per-
manent works within the city as might be judged most eligible.
And that the remaining five shares should continue to be vested
in the four said trustees and their successors in office, substituting,
however, the Sheriff.-Depute of Fife for the Professor of Greek after
the death of the present incumbent, for the purpose of erecting, a
college on a small field previously purchased by Dr Bell within
the city, with appropriate houses for masters, monitors, and ser-
vants, and with gardens, shrubbery, and play-ground, to be desig-
nated the Madras College of St Andrews. It was further provid-
ed, that the trustees should not expend more than the half of the
sum which remained in their hands in the erection of the neces-
sary buildings, and that the annual income of the remainder should
be applied to the maintenance of the said College, and to the es-
tablishment of eight bursanes in the United ColIege, to be held
by such only as bad previously been educated at the Madras Col-
lege for the space of three years.  The Lord Lieutenant of the
county of Fife, the Lord Justice-Clerk of Scotland, and the Reve-
rend the Episcopal Bishop of Edinburgh are nominated patrons
and visitors of the College, and have intitnated tbeir acceptance of
nominations ; and the trustess for their own exoperation have ob-
tained the consent of three gentlemen residing in the neighbourhood,
