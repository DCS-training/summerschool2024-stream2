       fishery.  It now could afford to lose the Parliamentary bounties,
       which, in 1830, were withdrawn.
         The shoals of herrings appear on the coast about the middle
       of July, when the fishing is immediately begun.  It is continued
       for eight or ten weeks.  The fishing stations within the parish
       are at Keiss, Staxigoe, Broadhaven, Wick, and Sarclet.  The
       average annual number of boats employed for the last ten years is
       about 900; abd the average annual quantity of fish taken for the
       last twenty years is 88,500 barrels.  The price of a boat with its
       fleet of nets and everything complete, is from L.140 to L.150
       Sterling.  Each boat on an average generally fishes from 100 to
       150 crans, at a price of from 1Os. to 12s. per cran.  A barrel of
       cured herrings costs L.1.

         The herring-fishery has in a very rapid manner increased the
       population, and augmented the rental of the parish, and the pe-
       cuniary resources of many of the parishioners ; but whether it has
       added to the happiness and comfort of the people at large, may
       well be questioned.  If it has increased the wealth, it has also
       increased the wickedness of the district; and any one acquaint-
       ed with the sources of happiness well knows that "a man's
       life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he pos-
       sesseth."  Very great care was taken to promote the numbers
       and success of the fishers of herrings, but little or no care to pro-
       mote either the number or success of the fishers of men.  The
