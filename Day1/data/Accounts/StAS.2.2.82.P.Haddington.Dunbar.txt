era of agricultural improvement to Scotland in which East Lo-
thian had the honour to lead the way; and nowhere is cultivation
better understood and more perfectly executed than in this parish.
The soil and climate are excellent; limestone and sea-ware, two
powerful agents in the hands of the tillers of the ground, are here
in superabundance; and there is a ready market for all kinds of
produce. The farmers are respectable, skilful, and enterprising, and
spare neither pains nor expense in availing themselves of their
great natural advantages; and their labours are annually crowned
with an abundant crop of the "finest of the wheat." The lands of
East Barns, belonging to Robert Hay, Esq. produce an average of
14 bolls of wheat per acre, for a succession of years.
   Rent of land, &c,-The valued rent of the parish is L. 16,953
Scots; the real rent in 1792 was L. 8000 Sterling; in 1823,
L.23,405. Annual revenue of the burgh in 1792 was L.500;
in 1834, L.1362.
   The highest rent, in the best times, was L. 8, and the average
from L. 5 to L. 6, per Scots acre. When prices fell, these rents
were generally converted into grain on the principle of a boll of
wheat for every L. 1, 18s. of rent; but were still payable in money,
at the rate of the fiars. The highest rent at present is L. 5, 5s.
per Scots acre; near to the town, L. 6 per imperial acre. The
average rent at present is L. 3, 10s. per Scots acre.
   Rate of Wages.-The annual wages of a hind are, 66 bushels of
oats, 18 bushels of barley, 8 bushels of beans, 4 bolls, or 48
cwt. of coals, L. 2 Sterling, a cow's grass and winter keep, 1500
yards of land along a drill for potatoes, 1 bushel of wheat for stack-
ing and sowing, one month's meat in harvest, with a house and

the summer; a worker, 10d. per day, summer and winter; a la-
bourer, 9s. per week; a carpenter, 2s. 6d. per day; a mason, 2s. 9d.
per day. Smith and carpenter work is all done by contract. A
double horse cart fully mounted with narrow wheels costs L. 12
do. with broad wheels, L. 14; an iron plough fully mounted, L. 4.
a pair of iron harrows fully mounted, L. 3, 15s. and upwards, accord-
ing to weight; upholding a pair of horses with cart, plough, and
harrows by the smith and carpenter for a year, L. 6, 15s. Lime
costs 1. 6d. per boll imperial measure.
   Cattle.-Corn being the staple produce here, very little stock of
and kind is bred. On a farm of 500 acres, perhaps but one cow is
kept by the farmers. The soil is rich. Breeding, it is said, will not pay.
