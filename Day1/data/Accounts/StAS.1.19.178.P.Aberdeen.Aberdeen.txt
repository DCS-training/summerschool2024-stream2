and burials for Aberdeen, and a large district round it, are
taken into the account.
   With regard to the population of this parish, it may be
proper farther to observe, that from what is already men-
tioned, it appears that the females exceed the males by
1037, which is more than an eighth part of the whole
number.  That this remarkable disparity in the number
of the different sexes really exists in this parish is evident
from the minister's rolls, which are as accurate as the very
fluctuating state of the people in so populous a place will
admit of.  It cannot be explained either by the births or
burials.  For from the preceding tables it appears, that du-
ring three distinct periods of ten years each, the number of
males born in the parish has considerably exceeded that of
females.  If they all had continued in the parish, the ba-
lance ought certainly to have been in favour of the males,
which is the reverse of the fact.  If this disparity were
owing to any extraordinary mortality among the males, it
could only be temporary, and would appear by their form-
ing a majority in the register of burials, which the ta-
bles shew to be also the reverse of the fact.  It may,
however, be satisfactorily explained by the following ob-
servations: Most of our manufactures, especially the bleach-
ing and thread-making businesses, employ a much greater
number of women than of men; and the great manufac-
ture of the place, the knitting of stockings, is carried on al-
most entirely by females.  Accordingly, while most of our
women remain at home, many of our young men emigrate
to other places, in quest of more lucrative employment
than they can find in this part of the country.  Besides, the
temptations of cheap and commodious houses, of easy ac-
