               Total, 35 inches and 29 decimal                   parts,   or rather more than           one-

                  Fogs, which are often very dense and wetting, generally                             come
               from the east. They seldom last above an hour or two.  This is
               owing to the breezy character of the weather, The days with fog
               amount in the year to 35. Westerly winds prevail. The winter
               is in general windy. In the beginning and the fall of the year, it
               is often exceedingly tempestuous.  The following table, calculated
               from observations made for several years, will give some intimation
               of the various atmospherical conditions of the climate of this part
               of Scotland.

                 It appears from this table that the range of the barometer is least
                 in summer, and of almost equal extent in the other three quarters,
                 and that of the thermometer is nearly equal throughout the year;
                 the greatest range of each instrument being- in spring. The range
                 of the prevalent winds in winter is very circumscribed. In spring
                 and autumn, they go round half the compass, and in the same
                 direction from south-east by south to north-west. In summer,
                 their range is also limited, but not to such a degree as in
                 winter.

                 The winters are becoming milder and more open than they for-
                 merly were. The number of days in the year with frost, and of
                 those with snow, is decreasing. This present winter, however, has
                 been very severe; much more so, indeed, than any preceding win-
