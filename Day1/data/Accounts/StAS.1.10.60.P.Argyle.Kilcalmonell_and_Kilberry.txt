     Statistical Account

in the immediate vicinity of the commodious harbour and
fishing village of East Tarbert.  West Tarbert loch has few
fish, excepting the fry of seath, knows by the name of cud-
ins, the taking of which, from the smallness of their size,
is considered only as an amusement.  Mackarel sometimes
visit it.  There are likewise some shell-fish, particularly oys-
ters, which are sold on the spot at 6 d. the hundreds and sent
to the markets of Campbeltoun and Greenock.
   There are in this district seals and otters, the former so
numerous as to give name to a farm in the parish, Ronachan,
Seal Field.  The constant resort of this animal to Loch Tar-
bert, is a proof that the quantity of fish on the west side of
the parish is greater than apprehended.
   All the variety of quadrupeds (excepting deer) and of
birds, native and migratory, (excepting the ptarmigan),
found in any part of Scotland, appear in this parish.  Heath-
fowl, in some of the hill-farms, come in flocks, and do much
damage to the corn; hares and partridges are no less destruc-
0tive; yet, from the severity of the game laws, the farmer is
not allowed to protect his crops from them, without leave
from his landlord, as well as a heavy tax to Government.

   Agriculture.-Some parts of the parish are well sitted for
raising grain.  Were these places inclosed and subdivided,
and a judicious rotation of crops introduced, their produce
might be more than doubled.  Introducing oats instead of
bear, would also tend much to benefit the country.  The
produce would be greater; much of the manure might be
used for potatoes; and the oats would not be manufactured,
like the bear, into a pernicious, unwholesome spirit.
   Captain Campbell, son of Lord Stonefield, one of the heri-
tors of the parish, has resided in it for a few years back, and
is almost the only person therein who follows a spirited plan-
