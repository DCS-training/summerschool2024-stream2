   Soil, Cultivation, Minerals, etc.-The soil in the carse has
been rendered more productive, by draining the swamps, by
laying a greater quantity of lime annually on the land than
used formerly to be done, and by streighting the ridges in
several places.  The soil in the higher grounds is in general
loam upon a till bottom, and in many places a stiff till, with-
out any mixture of loam, especially where the land is spouty.
A great part of the upland, so lately as 20 years ago, was
covered with furze and broom, which have been grubbed out
by the farmers, since the knowledge of improvement, and
the desire of industry have been introduced into this coun-
try; and their labour has been amply rewarded by abundant
crops.  The land, where furze used to grow, is now a strong
generous soil; and its strength may in every case be estima-
ted by the size and luxuriance of the whins, in its natural
state.  The soil which carries broom, in its uncultivated state,
is not so strong as the former; but it is a trusty soil, and
will make good returns of the ordinary crops, when tenderly
dealt with, and allowed occasionally to rest in grass.  Where
whins and broom are mixed, the soil is strong or light, in
the degree in which either of these prevails; and to encou-
rage the husbandman still farther, such land seldom requires
draining, where these plants are found.  Blocks of granite
have been blown in different places off the higher grounds,
and removed at considerable expence; and land which was
lately in a state of nature, lets now at a guinea an acre in
pasture.  Where the soil was spouty, at the skirts of the hills,
covered drains have been made; but in the clay land the
drains are all open.
