rish.  The other roads, not included in the present act of par-
liament, are totally neglected, and are next to impassable for
more than three fourths of the year.  One of them, leading
from the town to the very eastern boundary of the parish, and
nearly through the very middle of it, is about 6 English
miles long.  This line of road, the very worst, perhaps, in
the whole county, is essentially necessary to every agricultural
improvement in the parish; and, if made, would open a com-
munication between this part of the country and Glasgow,
several miles nearer than the present line by Irvine and Stew-
artown.  It is, therefore, most earnestly requested, that when
a new county road bill, is applied for, this road may be par-
ticularly included in it.

   Birds, Plants, Woods and Soil.-The migratory birds are
the cuckoo, the wood-cock, the bulfinch, and the green and
gray plover.-There is no curious plant to be found here.
The greater part of the parish being cultivated, no rare indi-
genous plants are to be met with, except a few of the Crypto-
gamia of Linnaeus.-There are no natural woods in the parish.
Besides the very extensive plantations, the property of Lord
Eglintoune, there are several other plantations in different
parts of the parish, and some very fine full-grown old trees
of ash, plane, beech and elm.  The weather on the whole of
this west coast is often very variable.  There are frequently
very quick transitions from heat to cold, from frost to rain.
These transitions, attended sometimes with violent S. W. and
W. winds, are hurtful to vegetation.  Trees, in general, and
especially all such trees as are of the refinous kinds, suffer very
much from them.-About one half of the parish is a stiff, wet,
clay soil, and the other a light sand and loam.
