of depopulation; but the fact seems very disputable.  In
many instances population has been known to increase, on a
great farmer's succeeding to a number of small ones.  And
the reason is plain to those who make an attentive observa-
tion.  A small farmer has seldom any cottagers, his men ser-
vants are unmarried, and lodge in his house or offices.  The
reverse is the case of a great farmer; almost the whole of
his men servants have seperate houses, are married, and have
a numerous and healthy progeny.  The number of farmer-
families is indeed greater in small farms, but the whole po-
pulation appears in several instances, at least, to be less.  But
even admitting it to be greater in general, the husbandry is
for the most part bad, puny crops are raised, men may be more
numerous, but both men and beasts are almost in a starving
condition.  The recent and excellent practice of using two
horse ploughs, has also been stated as a cause of depopula-
tion, as it reduces the number of hands necessary to be em-
ployed; but besides the expence of culture being thereby
lessened, and the value of land consequently raised, it may
be observed, that were waste lands cultivated, and the cul-
ture of others carried to the extent, and to the perfection
which it ought, and which it is to be hoped, will one day be
the case, the numbers of those who subsist by husbandry,
would become greater than they have ever yet been.  At
any rate, population is far from depending solely upon agri-
culture.

Besides which, ploughmen have generally a free house, a lit-
