in May, about the beginning of the month, if the land be
heavy; about the middle, if it he light.  Scotch barley is
usually sown about the beginning of May in heavy lands;
later in proportion as they are lighter; and in the lightest,
not till the end of May.  Potatoes are planted commonly
after the second plowing of the barley land, though the
best season is reckoned to be about the end of April or be-
ginning of May.  Turnips are sown the first or second week
of June.  When the land has not been summer fallowed,
one boll of wheat or barley, one boll and half of pease at
least, and rather more than 5 firlots of oats, are sown upon
an acre; when summer fallowed, somewhat less than 3 fir-
lots of wheat or barley; when grass feeds are sown, an acre
takes about 16 or 18 lib. weight of clover, and one peck of
rye-grass.  Dung is the chief manure.  The quantity requi-
site for an acre is about 26 two-horse cart-loads of good sta-
ble dung.  The land inclining to clay requires somewhat
more; lighter lands, rather less.  On good lands dung serves
for four crops in the ordinary rotation.  The price of stable
dung is from 2 s. to 3 s. 6 d. per cart load, of street dung
1 s.  Horses alone are employed in husbandry work.  Horse-
hoeing was introduced about 24 years ago, and has been
practiced ever since.  Small's plough with two horses is ge-
nerally used.  The harvest begins usually about the last week
of August, and ends on the first or second week of October.
In the year 1785, early oats were introduced here.  They
were sown on the 5th of April, and reaped on the 2nd of
July.  In the year following they were sown on the 31st
of March, and reaped on the 25th of July.  The harvest
for the other grain was in the same proportion later than in
the former year.  These oats, being ripe so much sooner
than the other kinds of grain, suffered so greatly from the
birds that the sowing of them was discontinued.
