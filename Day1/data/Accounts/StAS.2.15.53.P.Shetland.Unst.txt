gentry, and is of the same construction with the ploughs used in
the south country. The old Zetland plough has now yielded to
the spade, and is nowhere to be seen.
   In this island, far removed from a market-town, great or rapid
improvements in agriculture are not to be expected. It is well
adapted for a population whose chief employment is fishing, and
who hold their small farms as cheap places of abode, and for fur-
ishing them with various comforts, which they could not have, if
they had only their fishing to depend upon. Yet improvements
are silently going on, and considerable quantities of ground are,
from year to year, added to the old arable land. If the com-
mons were divided, and the improvable parts inclosed, from time
to time, as the population increases, portions of them would be
willingly taken at a low rent and cultivated by tenants; and this
is the only way in which improvements could be prudently made
in this place. To attempt speculations in agriculture here, on a
large scale, would be the height of folly.
