   Considerable improvements may still be made on this
harbour.  By carrying the south pier farther into the sea,
ships of any burden that are employed in trade might find
shelter here, Without extending the pier, the channel
may be deepened two or three feet, and the two harbours
might be joined into one, by cutting the bridge which di-
vides the town from the Quenzie.  If this was accomplish-
ed, it would save many valuable ships from being wrecked,
which cannot, from strong westerly gales, fetch any of the
friths, or any of the harbours betwixt them, but might
reach this harbour; and if the two harbours were united,
they could go out to sea with any wind, which would re-
move the great inconvenience to which ships are so fre-
quently subjected by being confined in the South Harbour
from contrary winds.  I have seen this harbour full of
ships, which were detained for upwards of six weeks by
the wind blowing from the S. or S. E.
   This improvement has been pointed out to the inhabi-
tants by some engineers, whom they have consulted: there
can be no doubt of its being practicable, and of its utility
when executed.  By an estimate from Mr John Gwyn, the
whole expence for making the two piers already finished,
and uniting the two harbours, was only L. 6891: 3: 6
Sterling; but were it three times this expence, the advan-
tages are obviously so immensely great, that it should be
attempted, and if once begun, there can be little doubt it
would be executed.  Perhaps it could not be easily effec-
tuated by the inhabitants of this town; but the benefit they
would receive from this improvement is so great, that I
hope some time soon they will seriously think of commen-
cing it, even if they should mortgage the whole of their
town's funds for that purpose, or lend some of their private
property on the security of the certain advance of revenue
from the increased number of ships that would enter the
