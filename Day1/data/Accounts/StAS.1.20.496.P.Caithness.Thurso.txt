a spacious bay, formed, on the east, by the bold and lofty
promontory called Dunnet-Head; and on the west, by Hol-
burn-Head; both which cover the bay from the tremendous
waves of the Pentland Frith.  These, with storms of wind
from the west, or from the north, beat with dreadful vio-
lence against those head-lands, and present an awful prospect
to the eye.  On the opposite side of Pentland Frith, in view
of Thurso, at the distance of eight leagues, the Hoy Hills
in Orkney, rising gradually from the summit of a range of
rocks, of tremendous height, which overhang the sea, rear
their majestic heads, and contribute greatly to the grandeur
of the prospect.
   At the bottom of this beautiful bay, where the river
Thurso falls into the sea, the town stands.  Between the
town and Holburn Head, in the western side of the bay, is
the anchoring ground, known by the name of Scrabster-
Road, which is skirted by a beautiful green bank, in form
of a crescent, extending from the town to the extremity of
the point of Holburn-Head.  The country to the west, south,
and east of the town, rises, by a gentle acclivity, to the
extent of some miles; and the intermediate space presents a
rich prospect of well cultivated fields and pleasant villas.
Thurso East, anciently called Thurso Castle, once the resi-
dence of the Earls of Caithness, now the seat of Sir John
Sinclair of Ulbster, Baronet, stands on the eastern side of the
river, nearly opposite to the town, which, with the improve-
ments, which are extensive, and Harold's Tower, standing at
the north-east extremity, gives a pleasant variety to the scene.

   SECT. IV.  Sea-Coast.-The coast, in general, through-
out the parish, is rocky; but Thurso Bay, towards Scrab-
ster, is sandy.  Near Scrabster, below stood-mark, there is
abundance of freestone of excellent quality.  The rocky
part of the coast is whinstone, which, in many parts, may
