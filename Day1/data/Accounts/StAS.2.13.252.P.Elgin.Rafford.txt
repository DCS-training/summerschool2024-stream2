  Of late years, the principal cause of its decrease has been the
uniting of a number of small farms into one. It is hoped that the
reduction, from this cause, has now reached its lowest degree, and
that our proprietors are convinced that they need not, for any pru-

surely forthcoming from a L.40 farm as from one of L.400.
 The yearly average of births for the last seven years may be
stated at 16; that of marriages at 8; number of families, 200;
average number of children in each family, 4.  There are two fa-

and dumb. The people enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the com-
forts and advantages of society, and are, in general, moral, reli-
gious, contented, and industrious.

Much attention has, of late, been paid to the improvement of these
several breeds, ind has been evidently productive of the desired
