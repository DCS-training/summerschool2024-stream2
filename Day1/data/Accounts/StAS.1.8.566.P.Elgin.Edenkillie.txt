     Statistical Account

rounded by a deep gully, or narrow glen, formed probably By
the river, which, at a very remote period, seems to have run
in this channel.  The rock is of a considerable size, with a
level area upon the summit of it, similar to the Downhill, of
good soil, covered with grass, and several trees growing upon
it.  The sides are so sheep, that it is altogether inaccessible,
except upon that next the river, where there is a narrow road
leading up to the castle.  It formerly belonged to a family of
the name of Dunbar; it is now the property of Mr Gumming
of Altyre*. 

   Character of the People.-The inhabitants are all of the
established religion, there being no sectaries.  In the lower
part of the parish, the Scotch dialect of the English language
is only spoken; but, in the upper part, the Gaelic is Rill
much in use.  About 50 years ago, the minister preached
the one half of the day in English, and the other half in
Caelic.  The people are rather gloomy in their ideas as to re-
ligion; but they are of a peaceable disposition, sober and
honest in their dealings, and very ready to extend their cha-
rity to the poor.

*The very singular Bridge of Rannich should also here be taken notice of
It is certainly of great antiquity; for tradition says, that it derived its name
from the illustrious RANDOLPH, Earl of Moray, who was regent of Scotland,
after the death of King ROBERT BRUCE.
