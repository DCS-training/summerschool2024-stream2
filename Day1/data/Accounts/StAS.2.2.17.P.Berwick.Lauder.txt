general aspect of the district. Both the turnpike and the cross roads
are decidedly superior to what they were formerly. Forty years

every day to and from Edinburgh and other places. The, desire
of education seems to have more generally increased, and the style
of it, too, is better. It must, however, be admitted, that there is
abundant scope for additional improvements,-some of which have
already been hinted at. Addhtional planting is required: and to
promote the industry and frugality of the labouring-classes, and
nourish in them a spirit of independence, it is desirable that there
should be established in the parish a savings bank, in which they
could from time to time deposit such sums as they might be able
to spare from their necessary expenditure. It is always incumbent
on the affluent and the influential of every description to do what
they can to advance not merely their intellectual, but their religi-
ous and moral improvement. "Godliness is profitable unto all
things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which
is to come. Righteousness exalted a nation, but sin is a reproach
to any people."
