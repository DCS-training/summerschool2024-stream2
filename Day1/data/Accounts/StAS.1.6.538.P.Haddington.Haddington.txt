     Statistical Account

The ages of nine of the children of the marriage amounted to
no less than 738 years.  Another thing remarkable of this
marriage is, that the 18th year of it produced trines, and the
21st twins.  The ages of the trines amounted to 256.  The
fact is ascertained beyond all possibility of doubt, for it was
communicated to the writer of this account by Mr Robert Keith,
a gentleman of the strictest probity, and himself son to one of 
the trines.

   Town.-Haddington is undoubtedly a burgh of great anti-
quity, for in charter of Ada widow of Prince Henry, son
of David I. soundress of the abbey, she stiles Haddington meum
burgum; it is governed by a provost, two merchant bailies, one
trades bailie, a dean of guild, a treasurer, eleven merchant 
counsellors, one trades counsellor, and seven deacons  of crafts.
The revenues of the town amount to about L. 400 per annum, 
arisig chiefly from the rent of the mills, petty customs, feu
duties of Gladsmuir, etc.  The town consists of four steeets,
intersecting each other nearly at right angles; the only pub-
lic buildings belonging to the burgh of any consequence, are
the town house and school house, the former built from a 
design of the late William Adam, Esq. in 1740, and the lat-
ter, which is large and commodious, contains excellent acco-
modation for bourders.  There are two fairs held annually,
one in July, and one in October, but neither of them are
much frequented.  There is also a weekly market held on
Friday, reckoned the greatest in Scotlang for all kinds of
grain*.  For several centuries past, a species of course wool-
ens have been manufactured here, and many weavers, parti-
cularly in the Nungate, stil make them; but the number of
persons employed in this branch is greatly diminished of late.
