afterwards those of Pitlurg in a neighbouring parish.  The
male heir of the Earl failed in the time of James III. and
the heiress was married to a younger son of the Lord
Seton, afterwards Earl of Winton.  Mr Seton was created
Earl of Huntly, and was a man of great abilities.  When
the Earls of Douglas and Crawford had joined in a league
which shook the throne, Lord Huntly, who was Lieutenant
of the North, led on his troops to the battle of Brechin.
But in marking out the commanders of the clans, he appoint-
ed his second son, the laird of Gight, to head the Gordons.
According top the ideas of that age, the Earl himself was
only a Seton, and Pitlurg was chief of the Gordons.  The
clan, therefore, insisting that Pitlurg should march at their
head, he applied to Lord Huntly, and claimed his right.
Huntly refused; and Pitlurg took off his black bonnet *, and
waving it, cried, " A' that's come o' me, follow me;" imme-
diately the whole clan went off with him, and left Huntly
alone.  The Earl, with admirable presence of mind, came
up to them, and said, " Gentlemen, you have overcome
"me; I yield it to you.  Pitlurg, command the Gordons.
" And now, Gentlemen, that you have got the better of
" me, let me see if you will beat Lord Crawford."  The
Gordons, in high agitation of spirits, attacked the enemy;
and Earl Huntly, after a most glorious and important vic-
tory, got the lands of Badenoch and Lochaber, for badding
(holding) the Crown on the King's Head.  From that mo-
ment the family of Huntly became the greatest in the
north; and this contention with the clan, by making them
feel bold, was supposed to have contributed not a little to
the victory at Brechin.

their servants.
