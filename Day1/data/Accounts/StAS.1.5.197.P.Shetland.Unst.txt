ever, do not amount to near this sum.  The largest farms
let at L. 2, 12 s.; the smallest at 15 s.  All the farms are
not constantly occupied.  The landlords rather court the
tenants, than the tenants the landlords.  The rents remain
nominally nearly the same as they were 200 years ago.
But these being paid in fish, in oil, in butter, the landlords
continue to receive these articles nearly at the ancient pri-
ces; but they sell them at advanced rates proportionate to
the increase of wealth, of industry, of population, and
of luxury throughout Europe; and thus in reality enjoy
an augmentation of income, as well as the proprietors
of lands in other parts of the British dominions.  Besides,
circumstances render it necessary for them to act in
some manner, as contractors with their tenants; supplying
them with boats and the other implements for fishing, and
with almost every article whether of necessity or of luxury
which is imported for their use from foreign markets;
while they purchase, in return, almost all the articles, that
the tenants can offer for sale; a traffic, by which they are
naturally and reasonably gainers.  The butter, it is also to
be observed, is delivered to the landlord in certain cases
by the lispond.  This denomination of weight consisted o-
riginally of only 12 Scotch or Dutch pounds.  By various
arts, however, and different imperfect agreements, it has
been gradually raised to 30 1 b.  The same number of lis-
ponds still continue to be claimed by the landlord for his
grassum rent, and by the proprietor of the teinds and crown
rents, for what is payable to him in butter; notwithstanding
so great an augmentation in the value of the lispond.  This
circumstance has operated very considerably to increase the
revenue of the landholders.  Complaints have, indeed,
been made of the injustice, with which the proprietors of
the teinds and the crown rents have availed themselves of
it.
