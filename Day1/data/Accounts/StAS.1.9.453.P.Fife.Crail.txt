     of Crail.

the last 4 years, have afforded L 30 a-year, to 20 or 25 pen-
sioners at 6 d. each the week, sad L. 33 more to these and
others in distressed circumstances, in occasional charities of
money, coals, clothes, etc.  As benefactors to the poor, the
families of Scotstarvit, Wormiston, and Sauchop, are men-
tioned with peculiar pleasure.  It may be proper to notice
here, an excellent custom which has been established in the
parish for more than a century.  An annual collection is
made at the church-door about Martinmas, for purchasing
shoes and other articles of clothing for the poor.  The sum
collected varies according to circumstances, from L. 3 to
L. 7.  A few guineas are always added by the session, so
that about L. 10 or L. 12 a-year are appropriated to this
useful charity.  2d, The fishing box.  The funds of this
charity arise from a small fee paid at entry into the society,
the rent of some land, and a half tithe of fish granted by
the town.  From these are paid about L. 30 a-year in
weekly pensions from 6 d. to 1 s. 6 d. and from L. 6 to
L. 10 in occasional charities.  3d, The sailors box.  The
funds of this society arise from the rent of a few acres of
land, and the interest of a small sum of money.  They
pay about L. 10 a-year in Rated and occasional charities.
4th, The interest of L. 500 in the 3 per cent.  S. Sea an-
nuities 1751, mortified by Robert Ramsay tailor in London
for behoof of the poor of the parish of Crail, under the
management of the minister and Town-council for the time
being.  The interest of this sum is divided yearly among
poor householders.  The whole funds for supporting the
numerous poor may be stated to be, one year with another,
L. 120 or L. 125 Sterling.  It is to be wished that all the
non-residing heritors would annually contribute their cha-
ritable mite, which in every point of view is a much better
plan than the legal establishment of poor rates.
