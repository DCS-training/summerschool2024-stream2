     of Carmunnock.

   There are few rivers of any note in the parish, except the
Cart which runs along its western boundary with great rapidi-
ty.  Its banks in most parts are covered with wood, which,
together with its meandrings, and the rapidity of its stream,
renders it highly picturesque and romantic.  It has many
elegible situations for cotton-mills, and other works of utility,
which require a great weight, and quantity of water.  And
it is surprizing, that, in a neighbourhood, where spirit, and
industry have so long been exerted, such situations, intended
by nature to call forth the ingenuity of man, should not have
been long ago converted into many valuable purposes.  The
only cotton-mill erected in this quarter, upon the Mearns side
of the river, belongs to a company in Manchester.
   The great road, leading from Glasgow to England by
Kilbryde, Muirkirk, Dumfries, Carlisle, etc. passes; through
the eastern part of this parish.  There is another road that
joins with the former, near to Kilbryde, intended as a
thorough fare to Paisley, and the neighbourhood, which pas-
ses through the annexed part of the parish; and there is a
third already contracted for, which joins the Paisley road to-
wards the south-west, and is to pass through the village of
Carmunnock, to lead to Glasgow.

   Population.-The state of population, as far as can be
traced back by sessional record, appears for the last 150 years,
to have been nearly the same.  Before the year 1640, a regi-
stration of marriages and births began to be kept; but seve-
ral parts of the register, from decay, and other accidental cau-
ses, cannot now be read.  What was the condition of the
parish 100 years ago, with respect to population, may in
some measure, be collected from the following statement.
