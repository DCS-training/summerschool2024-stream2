the quantity of powder from the bushel of shells.  And what 
is of great importance, the quarries in this quarter are 
easily wrought, and seem inexhaustible.  It has been men-
tioned above, that the lime-stone was let alongst with the
coal:  The tacksman is bound to furnish lime in shells at 
7d. the bushel; three of which commonly fill a single
horse cart.  From the lime kilns at Holhouse and Hare-
lawhill, the whole country is supplied, to the distance of
30 miles.  The parish every where abounds in free-stone
of various kinds, which is constantly used in building.  A
circumstance of a singular nature may be here noted; that
within the space of 200 yards, in one particular spot, coal
and peat, lime-stone and free-stone, may be digged.

   State of Agriculture.-It does not appear that agri-
culture had been prosecuted on this part of the border
either with skill or industry in former periods.  The late
Dr. Grahame of Netherby, a gentleman of extensive views,
and uncommon enterprise, had the merit of rescuing the
English borderers, in this neighbourhood, from a state of
idleness and dissipation, to which they had been habituat-
ed, by pointing and enforcing their attention to pursuits
of industry.  And he lived to see his endeavours crowned 
with signal success; having improved his estate from
2500l. a-year, the rental when he came to the succession in
1753, which, at the same time, was seldom paid up, 
8000l., the rental at his death in 178r, which was well
paid; while the tenants lived more comfortably and re-
spectably than formerly, when they paid little more than
a quit-rent.
   The habits and circumstances of the people in this pa-
rish, were much a-kin to those on the English side of the
border, when the present Duke of Buccleugh came of age.
