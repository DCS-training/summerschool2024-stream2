the town, the name came at length to be extended to the

   The parish is situated in the shire of Dumbarton, or Len-
nox, in the presbytery of Glasgow, and synod of Glasgow
and Ayr.  It is of a triangular figure, no where exceeding 5 1/2
miles in length.  Its breadth varies considerably.- The face of the
ground, although diversified throughout by a succession of waving
swells, is no where broken into abrupt precipices; and, ex-
cepting in one place of inconsiderable extent, no where de-

light reddish earth, upon a whinstone and gravelly bottom.
Around the town of Kirkintilloch, the soil is a light black
