inhabitants of this parish, have led to this short account of
its origin, and of the services by which it was earned.
   Upon the extinction of this right, many of the people,
being deprived of employment, were obliged to seek else-
where for that support, which they had no expectation
that the place could any longer afford; and in a little time
thereafter, the inhabitants of the parish were found to
