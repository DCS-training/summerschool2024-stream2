times four deputati as a council to the dean.-We know very
little of the three higher faculties in this University, as there
is no record extant, either of their statutes or of their tran-

in the University record.  In the first we are told, that, on
the 29th of July I460, the venerable DAVID CADZOW, then
rector of the University, began, in the chapter house of the
predicant friars, the clergy and masters being there convened,
