lake, upon its top, which never dries in any season.  On the
north side it is very steep and rugged;-the appearance
frightful, from the projection of the stones, and the immense
number that have tumbled down.  The stones, of which this
hill is composed, seem to be of the Basaltic kind.  They are
mostly of a regular figure, stand upon end, and are generally
from 2 to 4 feet long :  All this makes it probable, that it
has once been the seat of a volcano, and the loch might be the
crater.-There is also, on the very summit of this hill, a
flat piece of ground, surrounded with an immense number of
loose stones, called Agricola's camp, or garrison.  The stones

explored the north coast of the Forth with their ships.  It is
no less so, that some of the legions were garrisoned during the
winter, near the coast.  Dunearn hill, from its situation,
would most naturally invite them, to take up their residence

which that historian gives of it, in his account of the Roman
expedition on the north of Bodotria, i. e. Forth.  It was
full, he says, of hills, rocks, marshes, woods, and lakes.
-A little way to the north-east, is the hill of Orrock,
of considerable extent, but not so steep as the two former.
It affords also excellent pasture.  It is said diamonds have been
found on it, and that it produces capillary herbs.  There is
also a vitriolic spring upon it.-Next to Orrock is the
farm of Babie; most of which is hilly and high ground, but
yields good crops, both of corn and grass.  On these hills of
Orrock and Babie, several barrows of tumuli are to be seen, but
too large to be easily removed.  Some of them have, however,
