   THE name of this parish is derived from Dale vis, i. e.
'Watered Valley.'  Dallas is in the presbytery of
Forres, Synod of Moray, and county of Elgin.  It is 12

Bafford and Edenkillie, on the N. W. and W.; and of

and intersected by several burns or rivulets, falling from the
surrounding hills into Lossie.  These burns partly bound the
parish on the E. and N. and partly fall into Lossie within
the bounds of the parish.  The surrounding hills are cover-

some fields or haughs on the Lossie banks.
   Fine small trout are found in Loffie during the summer.

from 1 lb. to 3 lb. and a few small salmon.
