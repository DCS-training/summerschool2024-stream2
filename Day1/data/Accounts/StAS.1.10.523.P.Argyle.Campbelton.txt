Dalruadhain Kings, Aidan was the most renowned.  He
carried his victorious arms from Ireland, where he fought
many battles, to the Isle of Man, where he also conquered;
and at length to Northumberland, where, however, his for-
mer good fortune failed him.  In 605 he died; and was bu-
ried, according to Fordun, in Kilkerran, the burying place
this parish.
   Of Aidan's many sons, the greater part seem to have fal-
len the victims of his battles.  Accordingly, one of the
youngest of them, Eochan Bui', (yellow haired Hector) was
his successor; who, after a reign of 16 or 17 years, left the
throne to Conchar Ciar, the son of Conal, who had already
given many proofs of his valour in fighting against the Picts
and Irish.  In 622, he was succeeded by his son Ferchar I.
who left the throne to Donal Brec, son of Euchan Bu???, and
grandson of Aidan.  This prince was often in the field, but
seldom or never victorious.  In the battle of Moy-roth in
Ireland, (in the year 637) he was defeated with great loss;
and the next year had the same bad fortune in the battle of
Glen-muresan.  In 642, he was killed at Fraith Cairven, as
he fought with Hoan, King of the Britons.
   The Dalruadhain, or Scottish kingdom, greatly weakened
by the wars and bad fortune of Donal Brec, passed afterwards
through the hands of Conal II. Dugal, Donal II. and
Malduine, descendants of Eachan Bu'; but in that declin-
ing state, which is so bitterly lamented by Adomnan, towards
the end of the 7th century.
   Accordingly the house of Lorn, whose claims lay dormant
for many generations, found now a favourable opportunity
of disputing with the house of Fergus the right to the throne,
and of beginning those wars which, with various success,
served for a long time to weaken both houses, and, of course,
to hurt the genral interests of the kingdom.
