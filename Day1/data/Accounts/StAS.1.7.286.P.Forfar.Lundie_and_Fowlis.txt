     Statistical Account

The parish besides supplying itself with provisions*, exports
considerable quantities of grain.  There are about 90 horses,
and 300 head of cattle.  The number of ploughs and carts
is much the same as at Lundie.

   Population.-Owing to the enlarging of farms, and throw-
ing several possessions into one, the population has decreased
to the number of about 100.  The number of baptisms,
during the first ten years of the present century, was 163;
and, during the last ten years preceding 1790, only 91.  Yet,
during the last 30 years, the number of baptisms exceeds that
of the burials by nearly one third, there having been 300
baptised, and only 208 buried in the parish within that
period.  The number of inhabitants, at present, is 314, all
members of the established Church, except 8 or 9 Seceders;
among whom there are 10 weavers, 2 wrights, 2 taylors, 1
smith, 1 shoemaker, 1 distiller, and 20 small farmers, each
of whom has a plough, some with 4 horses, and others 1 or
2, besides the 4 great farmers above mentioned.  But the
present stare of both parishes will best appear from the fol-
lowing
