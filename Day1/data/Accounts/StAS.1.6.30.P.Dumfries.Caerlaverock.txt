   Eminent Men.-Dr John Hutton, whose benesactions have
been just now mentioned, was born in this parish; and, for
some time, herded the sheep of the Episcopal minister of this
charge.  From this humble station he was removed to be a
companion to a gentleman's son, who had taken a fancy to
him; and along with this person he acquired the rudiments of
a liberal education.  At Edinburgh he studied physic; and,
going abroad in pursuit of that science, happened to be in
Holland a little before the Rebolution.  While in that country,

That the legislature has no occasion to interfere to augment that stream
which is already copious enough, though not always derived from its proper
source, or confined to its proper channel.
In fine, that the establishment of a poors-rate would be, not only unneces-
sary, but hurtful, as it would tend to oppress the landholder without bringing
relief to the poor.
