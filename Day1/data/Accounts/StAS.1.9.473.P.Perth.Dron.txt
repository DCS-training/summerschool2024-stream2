plough, constructed on the same principles, but of neater
workmanship, and with some improvements, such as an iron
head, and a bended plate of yetlin or Carron manufacture,
for a mould-board.  The practice of using oxen in the.
plough, which till of late was so general, is now entirely
difused; but considering the high price of horses, the preat-
er expense of their food and furniture, and in case of acci-
dents, their being totally unproductive of any revertion to
the owner, it may be a question, whether labour might
not be carried on with much less expense by oxen, espe-
cially in those farms where the fields lie in a sloping or
hanging position, as they are known to pull more steadily
than horses.  This practice would likewise have a tendency,
be lessening the demand, to reduce the present exorbitant
price of horses.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the popu-
lation at that time amounted to 598.  About the end of last,
and beginning of this century, the inhabitants of this parish
have been much more numerous than they are at present.
This factis evinced by comparing the number of baptisms,
(for we have no precise register of births), in one year, as
marked in the session-records during these different periods.
Another proof of it arises fromthe evident vestiges of seve-
ral hamlets or little villages, which formerly were the resi-
dence of petty farmers, cottagers, and tradesmen, but are
now either totally suppressed, or exist only in a state of visi-
ble decay.
