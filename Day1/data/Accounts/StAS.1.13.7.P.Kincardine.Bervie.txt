masters:  It is only summer that such small vessels are 
able to navigate the seas:  In winter, they are laid up, and 
the sailors be take themselves to fishing, at least the most
industrious of them do so.  There are annually imported 
into the harbour of Gourdon above 3000 bolls of lime-
shells; from 700 to 800 bolls of Scots, and about 2000 bar-
rels of English coals, which supply the country for a few
miles round.  There are about 4000 bolls of grain export-
ed yearly, and which are generally carried to the ports in
the frith of Forth, or Glasgow and Greenock, by the ca-
nal.  About 30 years ago, 50 bolls of scots coals were 
sufficient to supply the demand at Gourdon:  For many 
years after that period, the inhabitants were much in the 
practice of using peats or moss as fuel, but the mosses are 
now nearly exhausted; and the expence of labour has be-
come so high, that peats are dearer than coals; of course,
the demand for coals has very confiderably increased with-

is now used in the town of Bervie, and neighbourhood;
but the partial and unjust tax on them prevents'a greater
consumption; ir is expensive to the manufacturer, and op-
pressive to the poor; a tax, which by no means can yield
to Government a compensation adequate to its extensive
oppression and pernicious effects.  Before the year 1768,
no lime was imported to be used as a manure; and for a 
few years after that period, about 200 bolls were sound 
sufficient to supply every demand.  About 30 years ago,
there were 3 fishing-boats, of a large size, besides smaller
boats or yauls, which in all employed 30 fishermen; but 
now there are only 4 small yauls, and 12 men employed 
in the fishing, and they earn but a scanty pittance, being 
old and decrepid men, they are unable to work at any o-
ther business, and must linger out a miserable existence,
with little hope of ever being-better; for the fishing-bu-
