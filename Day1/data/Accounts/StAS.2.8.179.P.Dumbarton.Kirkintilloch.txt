is the calm-limestone found in the pit at Holland Hirst. The
fourth post is the underwood lime thrown out from the Holland
Hirst coal by the hitch above alluded to. The fifth post occurs
at Shirva. It is the third post or calm-limestone which chiefly
runs throughout the parish of Kirkintilloch. This is a very ex-
tensive deposit, and, with some of the accompanying upper and
lower limestones, runs along the whole of the level tract by Cum-
bernauld and Bedlay to Glasgow, along the valley of the Forth and
Clyde Canal, in this part of the country, and stretches also along
the range of the Campsie Fells, where it is in some places 50 or
60 feet in thickness. It is a hard dark-blue lime with few organic
remains, and yields but little effervescence with acids. It is well
fitted for building purposes, and for smelting iron, but is little
used by the agriculturist. A fine section of this limestone is cut
through at the viaduct bridge on the Kirkintilloch railway near
Bedlay. The Bedlay lime, which yields large supplies to the
Monkland iron-works, is of this post.
  The ironstone found at Stron belongs to an entirely different
group from that found near Airdrie. In the Monklands, the ap-
per black band is found about 25 fathoms above the ell-coal, and
Mushet's black band about 15 or 16 fathoms below the splint coat,
but all these seams are totally run out before they reach this quar-
ter. The black band of ironstone, however, on the Barr-hill,
seems of excellent quality, and may yet be wrought to great advan-
tage. The following journal of a bore at Stron will afford some
idea of the order and succession of metals.

six distinct bands of ironstone, many of them very thin, averaging
