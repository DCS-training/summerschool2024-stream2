considerably injured agood many years ago, by a very violent
storm. There is also a good harbour at West Wemyss, for the
accommodation of vessels engaged in the coal trade. The erec-
tion of a new pier and harbour to be set down at the west end of
Buckhaven, was agitated some two or three years ago. Several
engineers inspected the ground, and were employed in making a
plan of the undertaking; but nothing has, as yet, been done. Could
it be carried into effect, it would be of great utility to the fisher-
men of Buckhaven; and from the eligibility of the site, it could
not fail to be a place of resort for boats and ships in distress.
  Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is in East Wemyss,
and is as conveniently situated for the great body of the people as
it could well be. It is an old building in the form of a cross.
The date of its erection cannot be ascertained. It has undergone
several repairs; and, although the construction is bad, yet, upon
the whole, it is a decent and comfortable place of worship. It
has sittings for about 1000 persons. It is by far too small for the
parish. From 900 to 1000 communicate annually. The people
are very attentive to the ordinances of religion.
  The manse was built in 1791, and is a good and commodious
house. The offices are also good, and there is a large garden. The
glebe consists of 7 acres and 15 falls, Scots measure, and is as
excellent land as any in the parish. The stipend is 17 chalders,
half meal and half barley, converted at the rate of the highest
fiars in the county, with L. 10 for communion elements. There
are some rocks and sea-weed or ware, that belong to the cure.
Captain James Wemyss is sole heritor. The presentation is in
the gift of the Town-Council of Edinburgh.
  There is a Dissenting meeting-house in connection with the
United Associate Synod, situated on the links of Buckhaven, about
two miles from the parish church. The clergyman's stipend is
L. 110 per annum, with manse and garden. The present minis-
ter is the Rev. Robert Pollock. The congregation is respectable,
and divine service is well attended.
  The following persons have been ministers of this parish since
the Revolution : Archibald Riddell, 1691 to 1697 ; Thomas
Black, 1697 to 1698; James Grierson, 1698 to 1710; John
Cleghorn, 1711 to 1744; Harry Spens, 1744 to 1780; William
