     Statistical Account

verage, there are 160 killed in the village, and 280 in
the parish every year, besides a very considerable num-
ber of sheep, calves, and lambs in their season.
   Tea was not known in this parish 40 years ago.  Whereas
now, it is almost universally used, and by a great many both
