   THIS parish, in its present slace, consists of the original
parish of CROY, and that of DALCROSS annexed to it.  It

of a vicar of Dalcross in the time of Popery, but none of any
clergymenbeing there ?? ce that time+.  The names are sup-

and part of the walls, of the church still remain; and the minister has a glebe
there as well as one at Croy.
