jected to servitudes, which must be performed at whatever
time they are exacted.  Their fields are neither regularly
formed, nor properly inclosed; and there is no lime, marl,
or shell sand which they can conveniently get to improve
their land.  These circumstances concurring with the natural
indolence of the people, lead to an easy conjecture of the
consequence,-Squalent arva, squalentque coloni.  But, though
their mode of cultivation is injudicious, and their efforts in
the prosecution of it are feeble, they derive much advantage
from implements of husbandry, lighter and better construc-
ted than those formerly used, particularly the plough.  They
all now have neat light ploughs, which, with two horses,
perform more work than the old machines could do with
four.  Carts have been lately introduced; and more would
be used, were the roads made passable for such carriages.
But these are quite neglected.  The statute labour is not
employed on them; and it is probable the commutation for
it will not for some time produce any material alteration.
The planting of potatoes in drills is another change which
has lately taken place in their mode of cultivation.  By this
change the labour is diminished, and the produce increased.
But they alledge, that the ground is sooner exhausted by this
than by the other method of planting.  The only crops
raised in the parish are oats, barley, and potatoes.  The qua-
lity of their oats is, of late, greatly improved.  The black
oats, the only seed formerly used, they have banished; and
they are at much pains in getting good clean seed from the
low country.  As Mr Campbell of Craignish is the only
man in the parish who has his farm subdivided, and in pro-
per order for improvement, he is the only man who sows
grass seeds.  Last year he had a good number of acres under
clover and rye-grass, and had 200 stone per acre of return.
Were the farms put in proper condition, and the people en-
