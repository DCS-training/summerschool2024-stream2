	     	I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        Name.-THE name of the parish, in charters of the thirteenth
century, is written Strattin and Stratoun. * A pair of commu-
nion cups, which are believed to have been presented to the parish
in the reign of Charles II., have an inscription "for the Kirk of
Stratin." Since the Revolution, the name has been written Strai-
ton. It has been, in all probability, derived, as Chalmers suggests,
from the Gaelic strath, a valley. The whole of the district was
inhabited by a Celtic race, and the village stands upon the Girvan,
at the entrance of a pleasant and fertile valley.
	Extent, Boundaries, &c.--Straiton is one of the largest parishes
in Ayrshire. Its extreme length, from Carnochan on the river
Doon, to the farm of Star, at the head of Loch Doon, is more than
20 miles. Its extreme breadth from the Doon near Dalmelling-
ton, to the farm of Knockgarner, is upwards of 8 miles. The
number of square miles may be about 82. It is bounded on the
north, by Kirkmichael and Dalrymple parishes; on the east, by
Dalmellington ; on the south, by Carsphairn, Kells, Minigaff, and
Barr; and on the west, by Dailly and Kirkmichael. Straiton vil-
lage is distant from Ayr 14 1/4 miles, from Maybole 6 1/2, from Kirk-
Michael 4, and from Dalmellington 6 3/4. On the Galloway road
there is neither town nor village nearer than Newton-Stewart, at
a distance of 30 miles.
	Topographical Appearances.--In a parish of such extent, there
cannot but be great variety of scenery. The valleys of the Gir-
van and Doon are arable, and are either cultivated or in meadow,
so that they present many agreeable landscapes. The rest of the
parish is hilly, and the south-east extremity is remarkably wild and
rocky. Craigengower, or the hill of the goats, rises immediate-
