   Character.-The people of this parish may be said to
answer the general character of the Scotch, for they are so-
ber, honest, and industrious.  The demand for workmen
and artificers is so great, that there is not an idle person to
be seen.  At the wool mill and printfields, great numbers
of young persons are constantly employed, may of them
below 8 years of age, who earn from 4 d. to 8 d, a-day.
And, as there are schoolmasters in the vicinity of all these
works, the youth, when not engaged at their employments,
go to school.  In this way their business and education are
united, while their morals are not endangered by idleness.

wear hats and coats of English cloth.  The young women
put on silk and calico gowns, and black caps and cloaks.
They meet together occasionally, and make merry.  Their
chief amusement is dancing, and upon these occasions there
is a pleasing cheerfulness and innocence among them.

practised in the parish, which is a happy circumstance, both
on account of the population, and the difference it occasions
in the look of the people.  The practice is not, however,
of above 30 years standing.  The minister was among the
first who began it.  He tried it with success in his own fa-
mily about the year 1761-2, since which the custom has
gradually crept in, and is now universal.  An instance of
the proper and rational conduct of a tenant in the parish,
towards his family, may be here mentioned.  He has had
12 children, and he inoculated every one of them.  The
