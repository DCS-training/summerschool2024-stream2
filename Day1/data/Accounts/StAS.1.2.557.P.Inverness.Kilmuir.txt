     of Kilmuir.

   About half a mile from the church, there is a mineral well,
of the chalybeate kind, but not much resorted to.
   Fifty years ago, the old Highland dress universally prevail-
ed.-Hats, long coats, boots, spurs, watches, etc. were
rare.  Now, every gentleman wears them; and persons of 
substance, of both sexes, dress as fashionably, and live in a
stile as elegant, as those of the same rank in the southern parts
of Scotland.  The common people, in general, still wear the
Highland garb, and adhere more closely, to ancient customs
and manners, that their superiors.  All the superstitious and
delusive notions, however, which formerly accompanied po-
pery, have entirely vanished; and the people's ideas of reli-
gion and morality, are rational and solid.
