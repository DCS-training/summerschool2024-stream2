siderably since 1782, and the farmers, at least in this parish,
employ fewer than they did before that period; and as the
cattle have advanced much in their values more of them are
reared in this country, and of consequence, less grain is
raised, and fewer hands are necessary for the cultivation.

   School of this Parish.-There is a legal parish school; the
salary of the schoolmaster, 12 bolls of meal; L. 2 sterling as
Session, clerk; 6 d for every baptism; 1 s for every marriage;
and 1 s 6 d a quarter for every scholar.  The number of scho-
lars, from 20 to 30.  The children are taught reading English
and writing; a few of them instructed in the principles of
arithmetic; but the Latin language not so commonly taught
at the parochial schools as formerly; though in general, the
schoolmasters are sufficiently qualified for that purpose.  This
is of great consequence to ministers children, as their narrow
livings could not afford to board them in a town, while at the
grammar school.
   My own family is very numerous: I have 2 sons and 5
daughters; and have been married 13 years.
   There is not an ale-house, or inn in the parish; we have
an annual fair in the month of February; where linen yarn,
commonly the production of home flax, is sold; and also
some farming utensils; where bargains are made for victual,
and servants are engaged.
   The farmers in this corner, generally employ hired ser-
vants; cottagers are very little employed; they are generally
tradesmen, and cultivate a few acres; which they hold of
the tenant, and over and above their rent, are bound for so
many days work.
