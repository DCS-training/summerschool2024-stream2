the husbandman, whether he sells them on the ground,
or feeds cattle with them; and he scarcely ever fails to have
a good crop of barley after this valuable root.  Some of the
farmers also raise a few yarns, which are good feeding for
horses, given raw, for they are not fir for boiling.  The
potatoes also thrive here pretty well, but they are generally
planted too thick in the drills, which are too near each
other.  The drills should be always so far separate, as to
allow the plough to get up amongst them, to lay to or take
away the earth, as may seem necessary.  The farmers seem
averse to sowing of flax, as they think their ground not proper
for it; it would surely be a very valuable crop if it could
be raised, as there are so many linen manufactures carried on
here.  But of this the farmers, who understand their busi-
ness very well, are the best judges.  The horses are almost
all employed in husbandry.  They are generally stout,
well made, and of a good size.  The black cattle are of a
middle size, about that of the Galloway breed.  There are
a few cows, however, approximating to the large English
kind.  Many more calves are produced than can be reared.
Hence they are fattened and fold to the butchers in Dun-
dee; but it would, perhaps, be a more profitable plan, if
the farmers could afford to keep them, till they were 3 or 4
years old, and then fell them to the graziers.  There is lit-
tle or no cheese made in the parish.  Much more emolu-
ment arises from selling the milk in Dundee.

   Minerals, Fuel, etc.-There are freestone and state quarries
in the parish.  Some years ago there was a mineral spring,
which was reckoned medicinal, and frequented by many
people, who received much benefit from it; but its source
being covered by the building of a bridge, it has disappear-
ed for some time past.  The only fuel now made use of
here is coals, brought by water from different parts of Fife.
