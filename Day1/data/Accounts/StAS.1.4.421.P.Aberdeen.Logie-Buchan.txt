     PARISH of LOGIE BUCHAN.

     (COUNTRY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM PATERSON.

     Name, Situation, Surface and Soil.

   LOGIE is derived from the Gaelic;  and is said to signify
"a low lying place."  The parish is called Logie
Buchan, probably to distinguish it from other parishes,
called Logie in this county, such as Logie Mar and Logie
Durno.  It is situated in the presbytery of Ellon, and
Synod of Aberdeen.  The river Ythan intersects it pretty
nearly in the middle.  The parish extends from the church
upon the S. side of the river to the S. W. about 4 Eng-
lish miles, but is not above a mile broad.  On the N. side
of the river, it extends about 3 miles, and in general is
from 1 1/2 to 2 miles in breadth.  That part of the parish
which lies on the N. side of the river, is in the district of
Buchan; that on the S. side, is in the district of Formar-
tin.  On the N. of the river, it is bounded by the parish
of Slains on the E.;  by Cruden on the N.;  and by Ellon
on the W.  On the S. of the river, it is bounded by Fo-
veran on the S.;  Udny on the W.;  and Ellon on the N. W.
