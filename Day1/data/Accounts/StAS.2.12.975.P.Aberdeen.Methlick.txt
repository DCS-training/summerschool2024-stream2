   It may be mentioned, that the deposits from all the parishes of
the Presbytery, with the above exception, amounted in November
1840 to L. 1584, 9s. 6d., and in November 1841 to L.2915, 11s.
8d.; and that the number of depositors was 160 in November
1840, and 257 in 1841.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-Of poor persons on the roll, the
average number is 45, of whom 20 receive a permanent, and 25 an
occasional allowance.  The yearly amount of church collections is
L.45, 7s. 1d.; interest of poor's funds lent, L.31, 4s., besides L.8
paid to the schoolmaster for teaching ten poor children, as men-
tioned above; proclamations and other casual supplies, L.10, 6s.
6d.  The average sum received annually by the occasional poor
is 18s., and by the permanent poor L.1, 18s. 6d.  The session
makes a weekly allowance to some of the most indigent from 1s.
to 2s. 6d.  These sums for the support of the poor are supple-
mented by the kindly and charitable dispositions of their neigh-
bours, and by other seasonable supplies in the shape of clothing,
meal, and fuel.  The application for relief is at first made with a
reluctance which nothing but the pressure of want is in most in-
stances able to overcome.
   Fairs.-The only fairs in the parish are, one which happens
early in May, and Dennick's fair, of great antiquity, and held to-
ward the end of November, which, allowance being made for the
difference of styles, will be found to correspond to the day of St
Devenick, the saint to whom the parish was dedicated.  Both are
useful, especially as feeing-markets for servants ; but at neither
are many cattle brought forward for sale.
   Alehouses.-There are at present 4 alehouses, and 3 spirit
shops in the parish.
   Fuel.-The fuel most used is peat, dug from bogs or mosses in
this parish and in Fyvie about Whitsunday.
