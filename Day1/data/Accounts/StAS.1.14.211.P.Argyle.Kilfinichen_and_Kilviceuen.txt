has been the general good behaviour of the inhabitants,
that none have suffered capital punishment in the memory
of any person living; nor has any been confined in jail
for any crime that is remembered, except one man in
summer 1793, who is supposed to be a fraudulent bank-
rupt.  Improvements go on but slowly, but still some-
thing is done.  There was but one slated house in the
parish when the present incumbent was admitted in
1780; now there are 3 upon the Duke of Argyll's pro-
perty, built by tacksmen, and 3 built by residing heri-
tors.  The common tenants also upon the Duke of Ar-
gyll's property, lodge more comfortably as to houses
than usual.  It may be reckoned among the improve-
ments of the country, the hills now being stocked with
sheep, and the low marshy grounds being, in general,
stocked with black cattle entirely.  Moss and marshy
ground is unfavourable to sheep; hills and mountains are
better suited to them than to black cattle.

Statistical Account, Mr. Campbell mentions, "That EDINBURGH is call-
ed Dun-monaidh, in Highland tales.  I thought it was called so by tale-
makers only, till some years ago, I had occasion to get Bishop Carswell
of Argyll's translation of the Service of the Church of Scotland into Gae-
lic,out of the Duke of Argyll's library at Inveraray.  It is also there
called Dun-monaidh, which signifies the "Hill of the Moor."  The book
was published at Edinburgh soon after the Reformation.
