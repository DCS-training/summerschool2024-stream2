very ridiculous stipulations*) are given as a harvest fee, dur-
ing the whole time of cutting down and carrying home the
corns.  These harvest fees have been rising for some years,
and are now 1 L. 15 s. or 2 L. for a man, and 1 L. for a woman,
besides victuals; and the risk of bad weather, to protract the
harvest, and lay hands idle, whom the farmer must main-
tain, and every thing else being taken into view, it will be
found, that the expence of harvest work runs very greatly out
of proportion to that of every other species of labour.  This
disproportion is the cause of many of the grievances we feel,
with regard to ordinary servants; for these high harvest fees
being nearly equivalent to a half years wages, not only deter
the people, especially women++, from engaging to work to a
master, but induces servants to desert their service upon the
slightest: pretences; and it is much to be regretted, that the
dislike of getting what they call a bad word, among servants,
generally ties up the farmer from applying for that redress
which the law affords.  The same silly idea leads them to
give way to the grossest: abuses in their domestic concerns.  A
farmer must often rise from bed at 3 or 4 o'clock, in a win-
ter's morning, to admit his servants, who have been junket-
ting all night in the neighbourhood; and he must perform all
the morning work of a farm, in tending cattle, &c. long be-
fore they get up, to assist him; nor is it uncommon for a far-
mer to go with his cart anti horses to Aberdeen himself, be-
cause he will not only take better care of his cattle, but per-
form the journey at less expence than his servant.  In short,

the same ridge with him.

++Women, when they are not engaged as servants, spin, and make their own
clothes, or work stockings, till the harvest approach; and thus are gainers by
not entering into farmers service.
