     of Carnock.

lage of Carnock, bears date 1638.  The village of Cairney-
hill forms part of the estate of Pitdennies, the property of
Sir John Halkett of Pitsirran, Baronet.  The villages of
Cowk-hall and New Luscar are but small, and most of the in-
habitants live in hamlets of two, three, or perhaps six houses
each.  Our only manufacture is the weaving of cloth and
linens.

   Ecclesiastical State*.-The church of Carnock appears, by
an inscription still legible upon it, to have been built in 1602,
by sir GEORGE BRUCE of CARNOCK, who was one of the
Lords of session, and ancestor of the present Earl of Elgin-

<FOOTNOTE>

*It is remarkble, that 3 of the ministers of Carnock were deposed or ejected
yet none of them for any alleged immorality; but all of them for what may be
charitably supposed to have been with them matters of conscience.  One was eject-
ed by Archbishop Sharp in 1662, for refusing to acknowledge the Episcopal form
of Church Government and Worship;-Another after the Revolution fell a mar-
tyr to Episcopacy, by suffering deprivation for not acknowledging King WILLIAM
and QUEEN MARY;-and a third, in the present century, was solemnly deposed
by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, for not bearing a part in
a violent settlement, to which he had been enjoined by the authority of that
Court This was the famous THOMAS GILLESPIE, afterwards founder of the
PRESBYTERY of RELIEF, whose case has long been, and sta11 is reckoned by
some, a singular instance of Presorterian persecution-As the lift of clergy
can be traced as far back as 1592, it may not be improper to subjoin the whole
feries.
