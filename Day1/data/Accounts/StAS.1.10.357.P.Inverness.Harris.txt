about 900 milk cows, supposed a breading slock, yet the
number annually sold to drovers does not exceed 200.  Un-
doubtedly a greater number sit for sale might be reared, were
the pastures properly secured, which of all the other objects
of farming ought to be most attended to.  Of this the people
are becoming daily more sensible; but still a number of inve-
terate prejudices obtain in favour of old usages, which will take
some time to be entirely eradicated.  Cows, sheep, and hor-
ses are too often allowed to feed promiscuously.  The inclo-
sures are too few, and these few are very bad.  The com-
mons are by far too extentive; for of the great extent, (in
most; instances of several hundred acres) which a tacksman
nominally possesses, all that he can call his own, is only a
stripe along the sea shore, about a mile broad, fenced with a
wretched seal dyke, rarely sufficient to secure his growing
corn against the depredations of the cows and horses that feed
on the commons beyond it, and scarcely in one instance fit
to prevent the incroachment of sheep.  The mode of tillage
requires a vast number of horses, which ranging along with
all the cows and sheep on a farm, over all the senceless pas-
tures, through the winter and spring quarters, down to the
month of June, prevent the early vegetation both of corn
and grass.  Upon the whole there must be a great refor-
mation in the habits of the people, and in their system of
management, before the farming business, in either line of
corn or cattle, can advance the country to any degree of
prosperity.

   Cows, Sheep, Horses, etc.-The number of breeding cows,
above computed at 900, leads us to rate the whole number
of black cattle in the parish at 2460, i. e. the breeding stock,
and its surviving increase at the end of three years.  There
is a vast difference in the quality of these cows.  Those rear-
