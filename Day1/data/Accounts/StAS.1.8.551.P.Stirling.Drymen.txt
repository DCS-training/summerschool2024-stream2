   Heritors and Rent.-There are 40 heritors in the parish,
of whom about one half reside.  The Duke of Montrose,
and Mr.  Graham of Gartmore, are the principal proprietors.
The valued rent in the cess books is 5069 L. 10 s. Scotch.

   Church.-The church is situated near the S. W. extre-
mity of the parish, about half a mile from the river En-
rick.  It was built about 20 years ago, and is a very
commodious and substantial edifice.  There are two other
places of worship in the parish, each about 6 miles distant,
where the clergyman officiates twice a year.  The present
incumbent was settled in February 1792.

   Poor.-There are 38 poor upon the roll at present,
many of whom are altogether incapable of doing any
thing for their own support.  The public funds are en-
tirely inadequate to their maintenance, seldom exceeding
20 L. per annum.  As no assessment for their relief has
been laid upon the heritors, they must depend, in a great
measure, upon private benefactions; and, in this respect, the
truly necessitous are much injured by the great number of
vagrant beggars, who, through some egregious defect in our
police, are permitted to infest the country, without any re-
straint or interruption.

   Diseases and Longevity.-The climate, though moist, is
by no means unhealthy.  The most common diseases, are
nervous fevers, and complaints in the stomach and bowels.
There are few remarkable instances of longevity in this
parish.  The oldest persons now living, have only com-
pleted their 87th year.  In one family, there are four per-
sons at present alive, whose ages, taken together, make 324
years.
