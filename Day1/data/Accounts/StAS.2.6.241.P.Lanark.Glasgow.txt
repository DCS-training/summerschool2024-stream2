	Old and New Style.--The dates narrated in this account of the
city prior to 1751 are in the old style, and those which follow that
period are in the new. The following explains the cause of the
change.
	In the year 1751, it was found that, from the year being comput-
ed to be rather longer than it really was, it gradually encroached
upon the seasons. It was found that the spring equinox, which at
the time of the General Council of Nice in 325, happened on
or about the 21st March, in the year 1751, happened about the
9th or l0th, and that the error was still increasing, and would, if
not remedied, cause the equinoxes and solstices to fall at very
different times of the year from what they had done in time past.
An Act of Parliament in 1751 (24th Geo. II. Chap. 23,) was
therefore passed, proceeding upon the preamble of the facts now
stated, and calculated to correct the error which had crept in, and
to prevent the like happening again. Eleven days, therefore, were
struck out of the following year to rectify the error; and to pre-
vent it happening again, the years 1800, 1900, 2100, and every
hundredth year, were declared to be common years of 365 days,
except 2000, and every four hundredth year, which were made
leap years; thus taking away about three days in four centuries.
	Umbrellas.--In 1782 the late Mr John Jamieson, surgeon, re-
turning from Paris, brought an umbrella with him, which was the
first in this city. For a number of years, there were few used
here, and those were made of glazed cotton cloth. As almost every
child at school, mechanic and servant are now provided with an
umbrella, there are probably more than 100,000 of them in use in
this city.
   Mode of Estimating Numbers at Field Meetings.--As very erro-
neous estimates are frequently made respecting the number of per-
sons attending field-meetings, public executions, &c. it may come
near the truth to estimate a promiscuous population standing close
together at six to a square yard; thus a park of an imperial acre
will contain 29,040 persons, and a Scotch acre 36,624 persons.
   As Scots money is frequently referred to in the foregoing article,
its value in Sterling money is taken from Dr Jamieson's Etymolo-
gical Dictionary.
