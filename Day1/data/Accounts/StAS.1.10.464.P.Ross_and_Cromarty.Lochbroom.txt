   Village and Fisheries.-The British Society have fixed one
of their village here, at a place called Ullapool, The Socie-
ty began to build some houses in this place, in sumruer 1788;
and private persons have been ever since adding to the num-
ber annually; so that in this village there are now about 72
houses, of which 35 are stated; the rest are thatched with
turf, fern roots, and heather.  The principal inducement
to settle in this village is its advantageous situation for the
herring fishing, which indeed is very great; being placed on
a lake, that has long been remarkable for the finest herring;
and holding a centrical situation with respect to the best fish-
ing lakes on the west coast both south and north of it.  The
herring commonly set in for Lochbroom, and some neighbour-
ing lakes, in the month of July; and often continue till spring.
They sometimes, however, do not remain long at a time;
