face, will secure them, under a roof, from the severest frost,
and render them more dry and mellow, and preserve them fit
for use during a great part of summer.

London, was son to James Grant of Rothiemurchus.  Hav-

ver, which the French physicians thought new, had broke

and settled in London, in I755, where he practised physic
for about 36 years.  His several medical publications speak
superior abilities in his profession; and the estimation he
was held in abroad is conspicuous from the correspondence
