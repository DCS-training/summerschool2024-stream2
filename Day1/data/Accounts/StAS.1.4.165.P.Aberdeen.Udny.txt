as formerly.  Crop 1782, from want of sunshine to ripen
it, and by intense frost and snow, which came on before it

berdeen, by which, with their own scanty crop, they sup-
ported themselves.  The church-session purchased some meal
and grain, which they caused make into meal; this was
sold in small quantities, to the poorest of the parishioners.
Thirty bolls of meal, and 2 bolls of pease, granted by Go-
vernment in 1783, proved a useful and seasonable supply to
many, so that no person died for want; but, as I have al-
ready mentioned, many of the farmers were considerably
improverished by these two deficient crops.
