stops here to see it.  The most remarkable circumstances
about it are, its insular situation, the thickness of its wall,
(about 9 feet at the surface of the ground), and its being
reckoned the birth place of the * admirable Crichton.
From the windows of the dining room, the spectator has a
pleasant view of the loch, with the house and grounds of
Forneth, which are here seen to great advantage; and a
wild romantic glen, stretching N. W. towards the High-
lands, and terminating in a bold range of the Grampian
mountains.  Lord Airly sometimes resides here a few
weeks during the fishing season, and has a net here, which
is never used but when the family are on the island.  The
neighbouring gentlemen are permitted the privilege of rod-
fishing and pleasure boats.  On the western shore of the loch,
his Lordship has a good kitchen garden and nursery, together
with an orchard, lately inclosed, and planted with a variety
of fruit-trees, all in a prosperous condition.-On the other
side of the hill, and about a mile and a half S.S.E. of
Clunie castle, on a southern declivity, and well sheltered
from every cold and stormy blast, is Gourdie, the seat of
David Kinloch, Esq; It is a large, convenient and substantial
house, beautifully situated; the prospect it enjoys is de-
lightful.  Immediately under your eye you see the level,
rich, and well cultivated estate of Delvin, with the magni-
ficent house of that name, rising on a woody bank about
1 1/2 mile to the S.  From the foot of the bank of Delvin,
you behold the river Tay winding eastward in stately me-
anders towards Meiklour, and there receiving the Ila at
the old castle of Kinclaven.  In the middle scene you have
a distinct view of the broadest part of Strathmore, from
Birnam on your right-hand to Dunsinnan on your left;
