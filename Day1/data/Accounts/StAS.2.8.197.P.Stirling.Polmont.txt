  Rent of Land.-The rent of Carse land varies from L. 3 to
L. 4, 10s. per acre, according to the prices of grain determined by
the county fiars, and of dryfield from L.1 to L.3 per acre. The
real rent of the parish is between L.7000 and L.8000.
  Wages.-The wages of labourers per day run from Is 8d. to
2s. Farm-servants, hired for the half-year, receive from L. 7 to
L.10, with bed and board.
  Husbandry.-In the dryfield the five-shift course is followed, and in
the Carse, very generally the six-shift, viz. 1. summer fallow; 2.
wheat ; 3. beans ; 4. barley; 5. hay, and 6. oats. Great improve-
ment has lately been made in the culture of land, in consequence
of the introduction of tile-draining. It costs per acre from L. 4
to L. 7, according to the nature of the soil, and, if small stones
or gravel be laid above the tile, the expense will be increased ;
but the increase of expense is amply compensated by the increase
of benefit. The whole outlay is repaid in additional produce in
a few crops. There is one steam-engine in the parish, which turns
a thrashing mill-a great saving in horse-labour, and otherwise not
costly, as coal is near and cheap. It may be proper to state, that
great facilities are afforded for conveying manure here, from Edin-
burgh and Leith, both by the Union Canal, and by the Frith of
Forth. Nor are these facilities disregarded. The mode of farm-
ing usually practised is of the most approved kind. The land,
particularly in the carse, and in the dryfield to the north of the
Union Canal, is almost in as high a state of cultivation as it can
be brought by skill and capital; but the same thing cannot be
said of the land to the south of the Canal, and in the most ele-
vated district of the parish, where, for the most part, the poverty
of the soil operates as a binderance to improvement.
  There are two works for making tiles and bricks.
  Produce.--The average gross amount and value of raw produce,
as nearly as can be ascertained, are the following :
