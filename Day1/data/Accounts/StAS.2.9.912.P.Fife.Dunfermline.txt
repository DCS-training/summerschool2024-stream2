   From this list it appears that simple disorderliness and theft
have been on the decrease, and that drunkenness with disorder-
liness has been considerably on the increase, during this last year.
   Fairs.-There are eight public fairs held throughout the year
in the town of Dunfermline, viz. on the third Tuesdays of Janu-
ary March, April, June, July, September, October, and Novem-
ber, for the sale of horses, cattle, &c.
   There is a weekly market held at the Tron on Friday, for the
sale of butter, cheese, eggs, &c. ; and a weekly corn-market at
the Cross on Tuesday, at which the grain is disposed of by sam-
ple.
   Inns, Alehouses, &c.-The number of licensed houses for sell-
ing spirits, ales., &c., including. shops in which groceries are also
sold, were, for the last five years, as follows:

	1838-39,	141
	1839-40,	122
	1440-41,	142
	1841-42,	140
	1642-43,	140

   Fuel.-The fuel used is almost entirely coal, and is procured
in abundance and of good quality in the parish, at various prices,
of which a full account has been given, when treating of the, col-
lieries.  There is, little or no peat in this parish or vicinity, and
there are perhaps few trees remaining of the ancient Forest of
Dunfermline, in which Sir William Wallace found a safe retreat
when pursued by his enemies.
