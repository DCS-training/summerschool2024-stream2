grafs, and a small proportion of red or white clover for hay,
or cut grass.  The late John Earl of Loudoun, succeeded his
father in the year 1731, and deserves the name of the father
of agriculture in this part of the shire.  He had both a great
taste, and great quickness of parts.  He prudently began
with making roads through the parish, as early as the year
1733; and an excellent bridge was, by his influence, built
over Irvine water; and the road from thence, and from his
house to Newmilns, was the first made road in the shire of
Ayr, which was done by the statute work.  He remembered
when there was neither cart nor waggon in the parish, but
his father's, Earl Hugh, and his factor's.  Now there are
above 250 in the parish, besides waggons for leading grain,
peats, &c.  Formerly they carried home their grain in
sledges or cars, and their coals on small horses.  At the same
period Earl John began to plant and inclose; he is said
to have planted above one million of trees.  The tree's
are mostly ash, elm, oak, and many of them are of a
great size.  One crop of hoop-willows from a small inclo-
sure of three roods, sold for L. 27.  The weeding and thin-
ning the plantations of elm, and ash, &c. yield from two to
three hundred pounds annually.  Many ash and elm trees
sell at one, two, and sometimes three guineas.  They were
all planted from the year 1733, progressively, to the year
1775.  The number of farms planted and inclosed, are about
fifty, inclosed and subdivided into small farms, from 20 to 30
acres each; in ll about 6000 acres.  Add to this about 1570
acres; the whole of which is inclosed, and amounts to
7570 acres, including 95 acres of natural wood, and 250
acres of planted ground.  About 1000 acres in sheep farms
are not yet inclosed.
