country, from the neighbouring towns, and the Highlands,
who, from an undiscerning humanity, and sometimes, per
haps, from timidity, are but too much encouraged.-
A very great change, in the appearance of the people has taken
place, within these few years.  About 15 years ago, all the
men servants wore coarse home-manufactured cloth and bon-
nets.  There were then seldom three men's hats seen at church,
on a Sunday.  Now, most of the men servants wear, on Sun-
day, good English cloth, (at least what goes by that name):
and there is hardly a bonnet to be seen in church.-Many
of the lower classes of females still continue to cover their
heads with the plaid in church:  But several them wear
cloaks and silk hats, and begin to dress after the manner of
those in the more southern counties of Scotland.-Within
the last 10 years, about 9 or 10 cottage have become ruinous;
but a greater number, and houses of a better sort, have, in
that time, been built.
