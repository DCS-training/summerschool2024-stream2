     NUMBER LII.

     PARISH OF REAY.

     (Counties of Caithness and Sutherland.-Presbytery of
     Caithness.-Synod of Sutherland and Caithness.)

     By the Reverend Mr DAVID MACKAY.

     Situation and Extent.

   THE greater part of the parish of Reay lies in the coun-
ty of Caithness.  A part, however, denominated Strath-
alladale, is in the county of Sutherland.  It is computed to
be about 17 miles in length, and 8 or 9 in breadth.  It is
bounded by the parishes of Thurso and Halkirk, in Caith-
ness; and of Kildonan and Far, in Sutherland.  Its figure is
very irregular.

   Surface, Soil, and Air.-The general aspect of the country
is hilly through this parish; but a considerable track, bor-
dering on the sea, is level.  In the Caithness division, the
soil is generally fertile.  A great part of Strathalladale is
shallow, barren, and fitter for pasture than for cultivation;
yet, even there, the industry of the inhabitants, and the skil-
ful use of manure, raise excellent crops.  The air is dry and
healthy.  Colds, cough, fevers, consumption, and rheuma-
tism, are the most prevalent distempers.  Rheumatism has
been known here only within there last 40 years.  The small-
pox, measles, and chincough, carry off numbers of children.
