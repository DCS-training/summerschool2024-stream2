loch, at the distance only of about two miles.  This has
contributed, in a great measure, to the present improved state
of the country.  There is also marl in the parish; but, as it
lies at some depth under moss and water, and would be at-
tended with some difficulty in draining, it has never been
considered as of much utility.  Equally near, in the parish of
Caputh, there is an inexhaustible store of lime-stone, of a
good quality.  There are, at present, extensive preparations
making for burning it; and, notwithstanding the distance
from coal, it is expected it can be sold so low as will enable
the farmer to use it with advantage.

   Long leases, and moderate rents, are likewise favourable
circumstances in this parish.  The leases, in general, are for
19 years, and during the life of the holder after the' expira-
tion of that period.  Some of them extend the length oven
of two lives.  The rent of the best and in the parish does
not exceed 20 s. and the greater part is below 15 s. per acre.
Thus the tenants are in a good measure independent, and
enjoy all the necessaries and many of the comforts and con-
veniencies of life.
