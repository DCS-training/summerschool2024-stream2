260		   KIRKCUDBRIGHTSHIRE.


	The amount of population residing in the different villages may
be thus estimated:
	    In Kirkpatrick-Durham,                                 500
            In'Bridge of Orr,                                       47
	    In Crooketford, (so far as connected with this parish,) 88

                       Total amount of population in villages,     635
                       Total in country,                           852
                       Total amount of population,                1487
	In every 100 of the inhabitants, the average number of persons
			Under 15 is                 36
			Between 15 and 30,          23 1/4
			        30 `nd 50,          23 1/4
				50 and 70,          02
    			Upwards of 70,               5
	Mansion-Houses.--There are no fewer than six mansion-houses
in the parish, occupied by their respective proprietors, or te-
nants in an equally respectable station, who in most cases re-
side here during the whole year; while the adjoining parishes
are every where dotted with the comfortable homes of families
of independent fortune. The neighbourhood is thus render-
ed in the highest degree agreeable; and the well-known hos-
pitality of the gentry has given it the not inappropriate title of the
Court of Galloway. Within the bounds of this parish there are
twenty-one proprietors of land of the yearly value of L.50 and
upwards, of whom ten are resident.
	The number of unmarried men above fifty may be stated with
tolerable accurac at 49; that of unmarried women above forty-
five, at 66.
	There are resident in the parish, one individual who has not
the use of his reasoning faculties, and three who are blind or nearly
so.
	Character of the People.--The people, in general, are orderly,
quiet, industrious, and contented. In the principal village the un-
necessary multiplication of public-houses at one time contributed
to demoralize a certain class of the inhabitants, and to introduce
wretchedness, disease, and beggary; but at present the abuse of
ardent spirits is comparatively but little witnessed, while the reg-
larity of attendance upon public ordinances, and the anxiety evinced
by parents, to afford their children the blessings of education, give
us reason to believe, that the character of the inhabitants comes
fully up to the average of their countrymen, in respect to intelli-
gence, morality, and religion. It is, however, much to be regret-
ted, that offences against the game-laws are frequent, and tend
