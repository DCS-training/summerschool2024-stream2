houses, and watch-towers, in different parts of the island.
But, in treating on this subject, the inquisitive mind every
where meets with darkness visible.

   Mill.-There is plenty of good spring well water in these
parishes, but not so abundant as to form a lake or river.  A-
bout 5 or 6 months yearly, the mills are supplied with water
by rain from the heavens.  There is one water mill in Bur-
ray; but that island is so dry that it is seldom able to grind
much of the subtenants grain.  For this purpose, they must
cross over seas; and, to comfort them in this labour, they
must pay multure at the mill where they grind, and also at
their own, where they cannot grind.  There are 4 water
mills in South Ronaldsay, at which the 12th part of oats,
and the 14th of bear, are paid.  The two wind-mills, lately
erected in it, grind bear only, and are paid with the 16th part.
Kelp is made from the weeds which grow below the flood
water mark, of which there are 4 different species, technical-
ly named, and accurately distinguished, by Linn‘us.  As the
sea ebbs, these weeds are cut with hooks, carried above the
flood water mark on barrows, and, after being spread and
dried, they are burnt in a round hole dug in the earth, built
about with stones.  The substance extracted by burning
from these weeds, in its liquid state, somewhat resembles tar,
or melted lead.  When cool, it becomes hard as the solid
rock.  It is used in the manufacture of soap, allum, coarse
and fine glass, etc.  There are about 125 tons of kelp made
annually in these parishes.  This is a valuable source of wealth
to these isles; and could a method be found out, during the
burning operation, to preserve the kelp in a found state, and
at the same time free from impure mixtures of earth, sand,
and stones, it would very considerably extend its use, and en-
