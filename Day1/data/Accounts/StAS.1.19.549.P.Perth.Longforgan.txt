best prevention, perhaps, in our power is found seed; to ob-
tain which, swimming in brine seems to be an excellent
method; but, as it is also probable that the pungency of
the stale urine, incrusted with lime, may be a protection to
the seed from various insects, while it promotes vegetation,
were both operations combined, it might be of advantage.
After the wheat is swimmed, and the sound heavy part
alone reserved for feed, let it be dried by frequent turning
in the barn-floor; then, when dry, sprinkle it with the
stale urine and lime, as already mentioned.  It is very pro-
bable the good consequences will repay the farmer for all
his labour.
   On fallow well prepared, 6 pecks to half a boll of wheat
may be sown upon the Scotch acre, according to the soil
and season, of which the farmer must judge.  If after clo-
ver, pease, or beans, or later in the season, more seed will
be necessary.

   Harvesting.-The shearers are generally hired for the
whole harvest, and their wages have, since 1780, varied
from 20 s. to the men, to 30 s. and upwards; and to the
women, from 14 s. to 20 s.; and if by the day, from 10d.
to 20 d. or more, to the men; and from 6 d. to 1 s. to the
women.

   Victuals.-All the shearers get bread and beer in the field,
i. e. a choppin (of about an English quart) of beer, and the
bread of 1-14th of a peck of oatmeal for breakfast; and for
dinner, 3 mutchkins (pints) of beer, and 1-14th of a peck
of meal in bread; and with some, it is also a practice to
get half a lippie of oatmeal every night, i. e. i-8th of a
peck, while the harvest lasts, for their supper, which they
may either use, or take home to their families.  Harvest
