1 L. 15 s. per acre; the holms on Clyde and Medwin are va-
lued at about 15 s. per acre, and the outfield lands from 5 s.
to 10 s.  Besides the grounds already described, there are a
few extensive sheep farms, mostly covered with heath, better
fitted for breeding and rearing sheep, than fattening them
for the butcher.  Excepting a few small flocks kept in the lower
part of the parish these flocks consist of ewes bought in, in the
spring, the lambs sold in the summer commonly to the Glas-
gow, Hamilton, or Linlithgow butchers, and the ewes sold
to the same at the end of harvest.  The sheep kept in the
parish may amount altogether to about 7000.  The number
of black cattle, young and old, may amount to nearly 1700;
and the ploughs in the parish to about 80; and as
these are, in general, drawn by four horses, the number of
the latter is consequently 320.  Besides, few of the farmers
possessing a ploughgate of land, have rome two, others
three, or perhaps four young horses; and the small tenants
have one or two for the purpose of driving coals, or meal
for the Glasgow market; so that the total number of horses
may be nearly estimated at 700.

   Manufactures.-There are no manufactures carried on in
this parish, (Wilsontown excepted,) but what are necessary
for supplying the consumpt of the inhabitants.  There
are considerable numbers of weavers both in the village, and
in different parts of the parish; but their sole employment is
to weave the cloth wanted for the private use of their neigh-
bours.  There are a few stocking-weavers in the place who
work for the Glasgow manufacturers; and an expert and di-
ligent tradesman in this line may earn from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d.
per day.
   At Wilsontown, in the northern part of the parish, an ex-
tensive iron-foundry was some years ago erected by two bro-
