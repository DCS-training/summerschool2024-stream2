belongs to the Synod of Angus and Mearns.  The town
is the ordinary feat of the presbytery, and lies about 7 1/2
English miles N. W. from Montrose.  The parish extends
about 5 Scotch, or 7 1/2 English miles, from E. to W. in
length, and towards the west side, is nearly as broad from
N. to S.  It rises gradually on the north side of the river
South Eik, and to a much greater height on the south
side.  To the west of the bridge on the south side, there
is a large plantation of pines, birch and hard wood, which
decorates the north brow of the hill, fronting the town of
Brechin, and is a great ornament to the country is gene-
ral.  There is another in the moor of Dubtown, about an
English mile west from Brechin, but it lies low.-The cli-
mate is dry, and in general healthy, except in warm and
calm weather, when fogs arise from the river.  The most
prevailing diseases are fevers, consumptions, and the king's
evil.

   Soil, River, Fish and Minerals.-The greater part of the
soil is rich and fertile, especially on the north side of the
river, and contiguous to it on the west.  The river South
Esk runs through the middle of the parish, all the way
from the bridge.  It produces excellent trouts, and in the
spring, when the river is swelled, some salmon.  The high
grounds on both sides of the river, are rocky, but not ex-
tensive, except where there is wood, and where the high
roads run.-There is a deal of freestone on both sides of
the South Esk, especially on the south side, to the eastward
of the bridge.

   Animals.-There are no uncommon animals in the pa-
rish.  There are a considerable number of horses and black
cattle, but few sheep, the ground being mostly laid out in
grain.  Cuckoos, lapwings, swallows, and other birds
of passage, visit the parish in their seasons.
