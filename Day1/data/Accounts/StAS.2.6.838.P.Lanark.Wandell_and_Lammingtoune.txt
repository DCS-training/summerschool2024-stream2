casiom "when Mr Andrew M'Ghie offered to preach in the after-
noon, he was barred by the Ladie Lammingtoune, and some other
women, wha possessed the pulpit in a tumultuous and disor-
derly way," her Ladyship, it is added, declaring at the same time,
"that no dog of the house of Douglas should ever bark there !"
   This exhibition occurred in March 1644; but the Lady Lam-
mingtoune, whose maiden name was Grizzel Hamilton, "together
with the other delinquents," were not allowed to go unpunished.
For, on a complaint by the presbytery to the Lords of Council,
"the saidis Ladie tammingtoune, and remanent persons were de-
creeted to enter their persons in waird, within the Tolbuith of Ed-

Mr Alexander Livingstone, at a meeting of his own presbytery
on the 5th December of the same year, "reports that he bad gone
