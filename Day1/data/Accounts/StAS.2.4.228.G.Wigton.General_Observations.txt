for a century and a half; but, though of respectable rank, were
not land-owners till about forty years ago. The oldest names, in
addition to those already mention, are M'Guffie, M'Kinnell,
M'Keand, M'Gowan, M'Geoch, M'Gill, M'Nish, M'Cracken,
Broadfoot, Donnan, almost all of which are evidently Celtic, and
must have come down from the remotest antiquity. While old
names and old families thus predominate, very few new ones,
owing to the remote nature of the province, have been introduced.
The chief immigration is from Ireland; and this is generally not
of a very desirable kind; though some of the oldest and best fa-
milies in the county were originally of Irish extraction.
	Miscellaneous Observations.--There is one important infer-
ence, to be made from the various parochial accounts; name-
ly, the great number of Irish settlers, and the inferior rank they
hold, both as to education, a spirit of independence, and other
respects. A third of the whole labourers of the parish of Jirk-
colm, it is stated, are either Irish, or descended of Irish pa-
rents; while in the parish of Portpatrick it appears that, out of
a population of 2239, no fewer than 421 are natives of Ire-
land, exclusive, of course, ofthose who, though born in the parish,
are descended of Irish parents; so that, taking thir view of the
case, the Irish proportion of the labourers will not be less than a
third. The parishes nearest to Portpatrick will of course be more
occupied with immigrants from the sister island than those in the
middle of east of the province; but, taking the average of the
whole county, we have little doubt that a fifth of the aggregate
population will consist either of native Irish, or of persons born of
Irish parents. It will also appear from the accounts, as hinted
above, that, proportionally to their numbers, the lists of paupers
in the different parishes contain more Irish than native Scntch.
But though the county, be thus overrun with adventurers from
Ireland, who, while they bring no money along with them, have
a tendency, by factitiously adding to the supply of labour, to lower
wages, and thus to deteriorate the general condition of the indus-
trious classes,--yet pauperism prevails but to a small extent in this
county; a fact highly honourable to the character of the excellent
classes in question. Out of a population of 36,258, there are only
about 700 persons receiving parochial aid, and some of these re-
ceiving only the smallest sum, sometimes less than L.1 a-year, in
order to pay, or help to pay, their house-rent; that is, only 1 in
52 persons is a pauper, being less than the third of the average
