year, while the potatoes abound, many of them do not taste
bread.

   Tides and Fish.-In the channel between this parish and
the islands to the west the tide is very rapid, and the sea
generally very boisterous.  The tide of flood sets in from the
Irish Channel, between the main-land and the island of Jura.
A branch strikes off to the weft, between Jura and Scorba,
through the narrow gullet called in Gaelic Corryvracken, or
the Gulf of Brachan.  The tide of ebb sets down this chan-
nel from the north, and a branch pushes in from the west
through the above gulf with uncommon violence.  The rage
of the tide in this narrow pass, especially when irritated by
the winds, is inconceivable.  The people, at the turn of the
tide, fish about it in moderate weather; but in the calmest
day they must make for the shore, before the tide shall ac-
quire any degree of strength.  Another branch of the chan-
nel tide passes to and repasses from Lochcrinan to the south,
by the point of Craignish.  At the point, and between two
islands which lie a little to the west, it is remarkably violent;
and strangers in open boats have often been fatally deceived
by keeping close to the land for security.  Some years ago in
particular, two small boats were lost in this current.  They
were part of a frail fleet from the North Isles, loaded with
fish, and pressing under every disadvantage round the Mull of
Kintyre to a market.
   The only fish that is caught in any quantity on the coast
is a kind of grey fish called Seathe.  When the weather ad-

evening and morning, the only time of the day when it will
take the fly, a man may, to his own share, catch 9 or 10
score.  The fish, indeed, is not very delicate, but it is whole-
