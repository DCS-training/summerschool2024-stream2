so fine as to be drawn through a ring for the finger, and so
much admired, that they have been worn by the present
heir apparent to the Crown.  To give an idea of the im-
portance and extent of this branch, one person in Sanquhar
for a number of years, sent to a single house in Glasgow 4800
pair of stockings annually.  This manufacture is still carried
on, but feebly, and on a much narrower scale than formerly.

   Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.-The parish stretches from N. to S.
about 15 miles, and from E. to W. about 9 or 10.  Its figure is
very irregular.  It was originally of great extent, and was much
enlarged, about the year 1730, by the annexation of a very con-
siderable part of Kirk-bride, which was suppressed about that
period.  It may, with propriety, be stiled the eye of the coun-

gradual elevation from the sea, on the southern direction, of
almost 3000 feet.-The general face of the parish is extreme-

try.  Within it is part of that high tract, known by the name
of the Lowthers or Lothiers, generally reckoned amongst the
highest land in Scotland.  These hills are bleak alert barren
on the surface, but contain immense riches in their bowels.
Besides these, more than one half of the parish consists of high
hills, some of which are green, others covered with heath.
Some rise gradually from the base, others with uncommon
boldness and majesty; some are of a conical, others of an el-
liptic form.  From their summits in the summer months, there
is a prospect, that dazzles and overpowers the eye.  The soil,
at the foot of these hills, is partly moss, and partly clay, but
in many places, when oats are sown, the want of a southern
exposure and the spungy nature of the ground occasion a late
and precarious harvest.  The exhalations which arise from the
rivers, and from the wet and marshy grounds, fall down in
