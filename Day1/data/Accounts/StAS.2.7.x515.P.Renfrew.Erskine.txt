   But the most attractive building of which the parish can boast
is the new mansion-house of Erskine, erected by the late Lord
Blantyre, from a plan furnished by Sir Robert Smirke of London.
"This building," says a modern publication, " is erected in the
manorial or domestic Gothic of Queen Elizabeth's reign, with
perpendicular windows, many of them large, and of great beauty.
The splendid irregularity of this style of building has been seldom
displayed, in modern times, to greater advantage than at Erskine
House, and particularly when seen from the water, its effect is
rich and striking. The house is of great size, extending in front
185 feet in length, besides its kitchen, court, and nursery wing;
the principal part rising in height to two storeys, is terminated by
rich cornices and decorated pinnacles. The internal arrangements
are exceedingly magbificent.  The house contains upwards of
seventy-five rooms, of which seven are public rooms of large size
and beautiful proportions. The picture gallery is 118 feet in
length. The vestibule, hall, and gallery open from one into,the
other with folding doors; and the whole of their extent can be
seen at once from the grand entrance, presenting a splendid per-
spective of 196 feet."

         In 1750, the parish is said to have contained                 829
            1771,                                                      870
            1792, when the last Statistical Account was written,       808
            1801,                                                      847
            1811,                                                      963
            1821,                                                      979
            1831,                                                      973

   It is a curious circumstance, and one well worthy of remark, that
this parish is the only one in Scotland in which the number of in-
habitants has undergone no change between the census of 1821
and that of 1831. The census of 1841 will probably show a very
great increase in the population of this parish, as the, Glasgow and
Greenock Railway, which has brought an immense influx of la-
bourers into it, will not, in all probability, be finished before that
time. *
   The following table will show the average amount of births,
larriages, and deaths, which annually occur here:
