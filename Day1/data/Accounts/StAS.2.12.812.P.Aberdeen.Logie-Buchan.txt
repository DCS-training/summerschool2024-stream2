   Character of the People.-The people, on the whole, enjoy, in
a reasonable degree, the comforts of social life, according to their
stations.  The use of tobacco is excessive, but of ardent spirits
rare.  There is a remarkable annual change in the population,
owing chiefly to servants changing their places.  My lists show
that it amounts to one-fifth of the inhabitants.  This migratory
nature of the population is certainly not favourable to religious in-
struction.  Public worship and diets of catechising are well attend-
ed ; religious ordinances are very rarely neglected.  The average
number of young communicants for the last seven years is 15,
and their average age nineteen years.
   In the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Presbytery
took vigorous measures for suppressing tulzying (wrestling), foot-
ball, and even holding markets at churches, on the Lord's day!
The athletic exercises of former times are seldom heard of here,
even on week-days.  The point of honour now among men-ser-
vants is, who shall be the best ploughman?  Music is cultivated.
"Boat of Logie" is still a well known tune ; but to the beautiful
song of "Logie o' Buchan" we can lay no claim. *

                          IV.-INDUSTRY.
   The parishioners are, with few exceptions, very sober, and most
industrious in their respective callings, which are almost all con-
nected, directly or indirectly, with the cultivation of the soil.  The
amount of their labours is estimated as follows:-

<FOOTNOTE>The hero of that sonG was a gardener at Logie in Crimond, about the middle of
last century; the heroine, a good looking little woman, whom I have often seen in
my early years, then married to a respectable farmer; and its author, said to be Mr
George Halket, a poetical genius who taught a school in that neighbourbood, and
whose rise in life was probably prevented by his Jacobitical principles..  He is re-
puted to have written some of the popular songs that greatly aided the Pretender's
cause in Scotland.
