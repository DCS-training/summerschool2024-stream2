men from 10 s. to L. 1, besides shoes, and other casualties.
Wrights receive 1 s. per day, and their victuals; a tailor is
paid per piece, besides his victuals.  The roads are bad;
Government proposed, after the year 1745, to make a mi-
litary road from Fort Augustus to Barnera barracks in this
parish, and to build bridges over the rivers and burns, so
as to render it passable for the troops and other travellers.
The bridges were first erected by contractors, who made
choice of those parts over the waters where materials could
be had at the cheapest rate; by this means the roads were
unavoidably lengthened, and carried over steep and high
precipices, up and down hill.  This made the charge more
troublesome and vexatious to the military who laboured at
the roads, that in no place or part was the road made suffi-
cient, or of proper dimensions.  Provost Brown of Elgin
was employed in summer 1792 to survey this road, attend-
ed by a country gentleman, well acquainted with the pro-
per line to be followed; and as he has given in his report,
it is hoped Government will soon see this necessary mea-
sure put in execution.  As this line of road is the shortest
from the metropolis to the island of Sky and the Long
island, and many bridges being already built, by which
much expence might he saved, it must appear the more eli-
gible to have this line continued.  From its present situa-
tion it is impossible to ride it; by this means travellers
are necessitated to freight vessels from Argyleshire at an
enormous expence.  A stage-house in the middle of the
hill would be highly proper and necessary.
