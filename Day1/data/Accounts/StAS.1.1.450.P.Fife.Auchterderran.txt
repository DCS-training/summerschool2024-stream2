most is a number of detached pillars standing perpendicular-
ly on the base of the rock, and separated both at the sides
and behind from the general mass.  They are of a regular 
figure, resembling the trunk of a large tree.  The rising
grounds are all green, but rather of a dusky tinge, as if
the plant did not delight in its situation.

   Agriculture, etc.-About a fifth of the ground in the parish is
employed in raising corn, roots, etc.  There is very little wheat.
Oats, barley, and pease, are the common grains.  Green crops
of potatoes, turnips, and cabbages, are introduced;  but, ex-
cept potatoes, they are not in any great quantity.  The sowing
of oats is begun about the 1st of March, and finished about
the 20th of April.  The sowing of barley is begun about the
20th of April, and finished about the 20th of May.  The 
harvest, in a good season, begins about the 1st of September,
and ends about the middle of October.  In a bad season, it
continues till the beginning of November.  The pasture, in-

There are 51 ploughs, 17 of which are drawn by horses

They are all two horse carts.  The best arable ground taken
through a whole farm does not exceed 20 s. an acre when
inclosed; and the same farm will let for as much on the same
lease when in grass and pasture.  The poorer farms are let at 8
or 10 s. an acre when inclosed.  The rent of one-half of the 
farms is from L. 10 to L. 20.  There are six whose rent at pre
sent is about L. 30 each, which, at the expiration of the old
lease, will let at L. 100.  Only five are let at L. 100 at present.
