been much neglected of late.  The whole only employ 8
boats, with 6 men and a boy to each boat when fully
manned; but at present, few of them have their full com-
plement of men, and some are laid up.  It appears very
probable, that a tolerable harbour could be made out at
Ward.  It is the castern boundary of the bay of Arden-
draught, which extends about two miles along the coast,
with a beach of fine sand, and a pretty large field of
bent at the back of it.  If a small brook, which passes a-
long the S. end of the Earl of Errol's gardens, were in-
troduced into the sea, at the end of the beach next the
Ward, there is every reason to believed, that a very safe
landing place could be made for boats or larger vessels, and
perhaps it might be the means of forming a very valuable
salmon fishing.

   Climate and Diseases, etc.-The climate is various.  The
E. end of the parish is often involved in fog, when there
is none in the W.  And in warm weather, the fog will
sometimes extend, from a quater, to a half or even a
whole mile, over the land, next the ocean, when all the rest
of the parish, except a little at the E. end, will be quite
clear, at least from about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, to
3 or 4 in the evening, when the fog becomes general.
Some parts of the parish have their crops as early, and other
as late as any where in the county.  Epidemical diseases
sometimes provail, yet the place, upon the whole, cannot
be faid to be unhealthy.  One man died in the end of last
year, in the 10 1st year of his age; another a few years
ago, in the 99th, and several above 90.  There are some
now living above 80, and even 90.  since 1788, epide-
mical diseases have prevailed much, and have been terribly fa-
tal.  The malignant sore throat, and putrid fever, succeed-
ed one another, and, notwithstanding every warning, were
