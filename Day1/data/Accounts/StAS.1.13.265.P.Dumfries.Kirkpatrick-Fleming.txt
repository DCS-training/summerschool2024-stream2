   Stipend, School, Rental, etc.-The Earl of Hopetoun,
and Sir William Maxwell of Springkell, are vice-patrons
of the parish.  The living has been augmented within
thefe 6 months; and exclusive of L. 5 for communion-ele-
ments, consists of L. 60 in money, and 5 chalders of
victual, the one half oat-meal, the other barley, a glebe of
5 1/2 acres, and 14 acres of moor, which the present incum-
bent has enclosed and improved at a very confiderable ex-
pense.  The church was partly rebuilt about 15 years ago,
and is at present in a state of complete repair.  The manse
was repaired in 1785, but is still very insufficient both in
the walls and roof.  The offices are in pretty good con-
dition.-The parochial school-house was built within this
13 years, and hath been kept in very good repair.  Two
circumstances have concurred to render this school less be-
neficial to the inhabitants than could have been wished,
viz. its situation, and the frequent change of schoolmasters.
Being situated at one end of the parish, it can be of no ser-
vice at all to the inhabitants of the other; and the want
of a dwelling-house, and of a competent salary, have
doubtless had an influence upon the frequent change of our
teachers.  The salary is only 100 merks Scots; the late
Dr Graham of Mossknow, considering the difficulty which
some poor parents labour under, in obtaining education
for their children, and the pitiful salary of the schoolmaster,
in great humanity mortified L. 5 a-year to the school-
master, for which he is to educate 8 poor children.  The
schoolmaster is also seesion-clerk, and hath some advanta-
ges from marriages, baptisms, and the writing of certificates.

with thriving woods and plantations.  The river Black Sark, though
here distinguished by another name, has its source in the old parish of
Kirkconnell.  A considerable arm of White Sark may likewise be said to
take its rise in this parish.
