     of Falkirk.

King Malcolm Canmore, about the year 1075.  We find,
that different branches of this family were employed in
some of the most important situations and transactions of
this country*.
   In the progress of society there arose among them the
three distinguished families of Linlithgow, Callander, and
Kilsyth.  The Viscount Kilsyth, and the Earl of Linlith-
gow and Callander, were found guilty of rebellion in 1715,
had their estates confiscated, and their titles forfeited.  The
titles of Linlithgow and Callander at this time centered in
the same person, and the Earl found means to escape to the
continent, where he died.  Sir Thomas Livingston of Bed-
lormie and Westquarter, Baronet, is lineal heir of the fa-
mi ly.
   Lady Ann, the only surviving child of the last Earl of
Linlithgow and Callander, was married to the Earl of Kil-
marnock, who joined the followers of the Prince in the
year 1745, and was beheaded for treason on Towerhill, on
the 18th of August 1746, in the 42d year of his age.  His
infidelity to the King is the more remarkable, as his family
had always been loyal, and as he himself, at the beginning
of the commotions in which he afterwards was an abettor,
had exerted himself considerably in behalf of the reigning
family.
   The truth seems to be, that as he was not in opulent cir-
cumstances, he was induced to become an adventurer; and
from his marriage-connection, he was in hopes that if the
Prince succeeded, he would be raised to the possessions and
perhaps to the honour of the forfeited and deceased Earl
of Linlithgow and Callander.  And this leads me to ob-
serve, that it is politic in a state to inflict as few permanent
disabilities and punishments as the nature of government
