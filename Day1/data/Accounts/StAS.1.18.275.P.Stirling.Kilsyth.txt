     of Kilsyth.

   The following remarks will in some measure explain the a-
bove tables, and they are necessary to prevent mistakes.
   Although the first table is an accurate statement of the
numbers enrolled in the mortcloth keeper's books, yet there
are a few annually die, who are not enrolled.  All who are
still born, and even a few infants have not the use of the
mortcloth; but to counterbalance this on the other hand, such
children as are still born or not baptised, are not included in
the foregoing register of baptisms.
   From the first of these tables, supposing them to be accu-
rate, it will appear, that on an average of 10 years, about 51
die annually: and that January, February, March, April,
and May, are the most fatal months; next to them is June,
November, and December; and on the other hand, July,
August, and September, are in general the most healthy
months.
   From the second table, it will appear, that in the same pe-
riod, two thirds of the mortality bill consists of children: and
two thirds of the remainder of old men and women: and
that there is a very small proportion of young men and
young women that die, that is between the age of 15
and 30.
   From the third table, it will appear, that the small pox are
by much the most fatal of all the diseases to which we are lia-
ble.  When this disease prevails, the mortality bill rises for
that year, and vice versa.

   Heritors, etc.-The heritors of this parish are not very
numerous, and few of them have property in it to a great ex-
tent.  Sir Archibald Edmonstone, of Duntreath, Bart is pro-
prietor of five sixths of the parish, and superior of the whole,
except a valuation of L. 80 Scots.  He is also titular of the
fiends.
