whither horses or oxen be employed, are yoke a-breast,
with a straight pole fixed to all of their noses, which the
driver holds in the middle, and walks baclwards before
them.  From the form of the plough, it is evident it can
neither raise the furrow thoroughly, or what is called plow
clear, nor turn it over perfectly, but must either suffer it to
stand on the edge, or, what is much more common, to fall
back with the surface uppermost.  Their way of yoking their

the event to divine providence.  Neither are they more en-

cation of manures.  Some of them have excellent marl almost
for the lifting, and lime for the taking up and laying on their
lands, at the sole expence of the proprietor, and yet they will
