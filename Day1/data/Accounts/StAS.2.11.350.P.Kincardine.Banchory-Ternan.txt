under sixteen, were attending school, and 62 persons in the parish
were above 70 years of age. The whole population consisted of
1073 males, and 1167 females, inhabiting 501 houses, and consti-
tuting 535 families. Of these families, 26 are those of proprietors,
capitalists, and professional men. About 125 are employed in trade
and h`ndicraft; 246 belong to occupiers of land, 12 of whom pay
L. 100 and upwards of rent; 46 pay L.50 and above; 17 between
L.50 and L.20; 171 below L.20; nearly one-half of the whole
of these occupiers of land are also labourers, and earn wages
through a part of the year; 49 families are those of paupers, and
the rest labourers and servants. The population, though mixed,
is Celtic in its general character, spirit, and appearance; but
there is no historical or traditional account of the Gaelic lan-
guage having been spoken in the parish. No particular names
seem at any time to have prevailed among the inhabitants; nor,
with some exceptions, do the descendants of the same families
appear to have remained within the parish since 1688.
	Illicit distillation formerly prevailed to a great extent, and pro-
duced its baneful effects on the morals of the people; but it has
been suppressed for many years. The floating of wood is an oc-
cupation which seems to have an unfavourable effect on the cha-
racter and habits of those who engage in it; but, happily, every
few here undertake this employment. Poaching is not remarkably
common. There has been one criminal case from this place be-
fore the High Court of Justiciary, and fourteen before the She-
riff's Court during the last ten years. Nine of these were thefts
committed by strangers in thd parish; five were cases of assault
by inhabitants.
