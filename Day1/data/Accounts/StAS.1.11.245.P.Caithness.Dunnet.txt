the kingdom, be a treasure; but here it yields nothing, except
a small rent to one of the neighbouring proprietors, for the
privilege of quarrying millstones; an article, in which the
greater part of the county are supplied from thence.  There
are several small lochs in different parts of the Head, which
furnish water, sufficient for a mill, through the greater part of
the year.

   Sea Coast, Kelp, Lakes, etc.-On the E. of Dunnet Bay,
there is a beautiful level sand, for two miles along the shore,
over which the sea ebbs and flows, above a quarter of a mile.
But as there is commonly a great breach upon the shore, very
few shell fish are found in it, and these of little value.  The
sand, above high-water mark, is loose; and by being exposed
to driving, from the suction of the bay, frequently hurts the
neighbouring lands.  Adjoining to that, there is a tract of
barren sand, nearly 2 miles in diameter, which is said to have
been arable ground, or rich pasture, some time about the end
of last century.  The ruins of cottages are now appearing in
different parts of it; but they seem to be of a much older date.
The part of the parish to the E. of Dunnet Head, along the
Pentland Frith, has a low rocky shore, which, on an average,
may produce about 20 tons of kelp per annum.  A few
tons may likewise be made on the shores to the N. of
Dunnet Bay.  The other uncultivated grounds are chiefly
moss and moor; and of the last a great part is capable of cul-
tivation.  There is scarcely an eminence in the parish, except
in Dunnet Head, that deserves the name of a hill.  Three
lakes, attach about a mile in length, and half as much in breadth,
supply the principal mills with water.  A few small trouts are
found in one of these; the other two, being in the vicinity of
the sand, are frequented only by a few cels.
