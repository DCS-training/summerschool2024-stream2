   Rent, Produce, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 3551: 1: 6 Scots.  It is believed that the real rent, in-
cluding fisheries, is not much short of L. 2000 Sterling.
The rent of arable land is from one to two guineas an acre,
and of pasture, in its natural state, 10 s. and 12 s. and acre.
The farms are of very unequal rent and extent, being from
L. 10 to L. 115 a year.  About 12,000 sheep, 3000 black
cattle, a few scores of goats, and perhaps 200 horses, are kept
in the parish; and 600 or 800 acres of the ground may be
employed in tillage.  Almost the only crop is oats, with an
acre or two of barley to a family, some pease, and generally
as many potatoes as serve the family twice a day for 7 or 8
months in the year.  Few or no cottagers are now employed
by the farmers of this parish in agriculture, nor have been
for a long while past.  A cottager's benefit, (as it is called) is
commonly from L. 10 to L. 15 a year; the wages of a hired 
servant is from L. 6 to L. 7 a year.  Farmers who have graz-
ing farms, upon which they do not reside themselves, are o-
bliged to employ cottagers to take care of the stock upon
them; and it is considered as so desirable a situation, that
those farmers who have occasion for married herds to take
care of their stock, have it generally in their power to make
a choice.  The black cattle are of a small handsome kind:
The cows, when fattened, weigh from 18 to 27 stone.  The
Sheep, when killed off the common open pasture, at 2 and 3
years old weigh from 30 to 50 lb.  The chief staple com-
modify is raising young cattle and sheep.  The  young cattle
are for the most part sold to the grazier when half sums, that
is, when two years and a half old, and are changed from
hand to hand till they are four or five years old, when they
are sent up to St. Faith and Hampton fairs in England, and
make part of what are called the fine Scots galloways.  The
sheep are sold at two and three years old, to supply the de-
