     PARISH OF PRESTON-KIRK.

     Lothian and Tweeddale.

     By the Rev. Mr. DANIEL M'QUEEN, Minister.

     Name, Situation and Extent.

   THE parish of PRESTON-KIRK (formerly called Preston-
haugh), lies nearly in the centre of the fertile county
of East Lothian, extending about 4 miles from W. to E.,
on the line of the great road to England, by Berwick; and, at
its greatest breadth, about 7 miles from N. to S.  The parish
church, which is pleasantly situated on a small eminence, close
by the river Tyne, is equally distant from Haddington and
Dunbar.

   Surface, Soil, River and Fish.-The surface of the ground
is agreeably varied; and, were it more generally clothed with
planting, would afford as beautiful views as any part of
the county.  But the richness of the soil, and the superior
profits derived from tillage, prevent this from being the
case.  The river Tyne, which takes its rise about 10 miles
above Haddington, winds through the middle of the parish,
