above the Bochle, though the flattest part of the parish, is called
the Braes of Glenlivet; below it, the river, or water of Livet, as it
is generally termed, runs through the centre of the valley, and
then, though comprehending a more level district, called Morange,
diverging from the east bank of the river, the country has much
more of the characteristics of the true bighland glen. In the
lower or parish church district, the Aven, which enters the pa-
rish from the southwest, and skirts Glenlivet for about a couple
of miles, flows on through a narrow strath or glen to the Spey,
from which the ascent is not so rapid, there being to the north of
Cairnocay a considerable breadth of cotntry Sloping gradually to
the mountain as well as to the river.
  Benrinnes, which, though much lower than some others, is al-
ways classed among the highest mountains of Scotland, is situated
on the eastern or Aberlour boundary towering to the height of
2763.5 feet (according to the late Government survey) above low
mater-mark. This mountain, when seen from Inveraven PI'Oper,
has rather a tame and heavy appearance, but its aspect from
Glenlivet is both imposing and majestic,-while from the top, (where
there is a small bason in the rock usually filled with water, and a
cave supposed to have been the hiding-place of James Grant of
Carron, better known by the name of James au Tuim, or James
of the hill,) the prospect is very extensive, stretching, it is said,
from Caithness to-the county of Dumbarton. The other moun-
tains, both within and bounding the.parish, are all of considerable
altitude, but they present little either in conformation or appear-
ance particularly deserving of notice. They consist chiefly of flat
unbroken ranges running in a southern and western direction.
  Climate, Diseases, 4-c-The climate is decidedly different in
each of the three districts into which nature has divided the pa-
rish,-the coldest, which is that of the Braes of Glenlivet, being
perhaps as much inferior to the climate on the river sides, in the
parish church district,' ar the latter is inferior to the climate of the
sea coast. Snow, the first indications of which usually manifest
themselves on the top of Benrinnes, not unfrequently lies in In-
veraven proper, as well as in the upper districts to a great depth,
interrupting field oppratiom, and sometimes shutting up the
communication, when, at the distance of ten or fifteen miles, nut
a vestige of hoary winter isto he seen; still the climate is abun-
dantly healthy, and such as to serve in ordinary seasons for bring-
ing to maturity the fruits commonly proud in the gardens on,
