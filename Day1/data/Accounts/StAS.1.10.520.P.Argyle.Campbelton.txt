took place in that country, under the reign of Cormac
O'Cuin, and effected a settlement in the southern parts of
the Pictish dominions, from which they had formerly been

was conducted by Reuda, (as Bede calls him) or Cairbre

author of the Notitia Imperii, and by other writers of the
4th and 5th centuries, called Scotti and Atacotti; the first,

called Atascotti, the place or territory of the Scots.
   About the middle of the 5th century, (according to Gildas
in 446,) the Scots were again driven back to Ireland, where
they remained till 503, when they returned under the con-
