tated them to the bottom.  There is a considerable fall on the
Bruir, near half a mile above the highway, which makes a ve-
ry grand appearance, when there is a proper quantity of wa-
ter.
   North-east of the fall of Bruir, is Elrig, i.e. Iaoth-leirg, or
the inclosed field, the field of a multitude, or of danger.  The 
meaning intended probably is, the surrounded or inclosed
field.  There are many places of this name amongst our hills.
Their situation is, a rising ground, an open ad pretty plain
hill around it.  On this rising ground, the king, the chieftain,
or principal person, with his friends, arms, and hounds, took
his station; while his people, also armed, gathering the deer
into his fight, formed a circle round them.  Then the hounds
were let loose, the arrows let fly, and the men, who formed
the circle, wounded and killed many of the deer, with their
swords, when attempting to make their escape.  It is confi-
dently assurred, that in Duke Jame's time, John Robertson,
Esq. of Eastertyre, and John Stewart in Blair-Atholl, cut,
each of them, a deer in two, by a single stroke of their broad
swords.  They were both remarkable for strength and activity.
Several of their children are yet alive.-South-east of Elerig,
betwixt it and Blair, lies Craig urrard.  Craig signifies a rock,
ard, a height, and ur, either heath or fire.  It is probable, it
was so called, from fire, used in that conspicuous place, ei-
ther for signals, or for a religious purpose.  Glen-mairc, is
the Glen of Horses.  The sides of it consist of high and steep
precipices.  In the late Duke's time, a great quantity of rocks
fell down the one side of it, with such force, that some of
them went a good way up the opposite side.  About the same
time and place, a vast wreath of snow fell upon a herd of deer,
and smothered them.  This was known, from their bones be-
ing found there, when the snow was dissolved.
