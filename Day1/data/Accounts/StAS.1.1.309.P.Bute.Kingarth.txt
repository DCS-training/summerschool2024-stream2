Clyde passing and repassing.  Nearly the whole of the parish is
inclosed and subdivided with datch and hedge; which afford
shelter and warmth, and make an agreeable appearance.  The
soil, In general, is light and sandy, fit (when properly culti-
vated, which it has been in some farms, but particularly about
Mount Stuart, where fields have been, and are still cultivated
to the highest perfection), for crops of barley, turnip, rye-
grass, and clover of every kind.  Inclosed land is let, at an a-
verage, from 10 s. to 15 s. per acre; outfield land from 3 s.
to 3 s. 6 d. per acre Farms, at an average, from L. 30 to
L. 60 per farm.  Nearly the one half of the rents are paid
by barley; the other half by oats and cattle.  The te-
nants find a ready sale for their barley to the distillers of
whisky in the island.  For some years past, the pike of bar-
ley has been, at an average, from 8 s. to 20 s. per boll.  The
parish likewise produces oats.  Perhaps too many are sown
in this soil.  The price of oats, for seven yaers past, has 
been from 14 s. to 16 s. per boll.  Large is the only
market town for oats.  Potatoes are in great plenty; and
these, with herrings, are the chief maintenance of the greatest
number of the inhabitants for three quarters of the year.
Clover and rye-grass hay is sold to the inhabitants of Rothe-
say at 4 s. and 5 s. per trufs, equal to 15 stone English.
The average price of oat-meal, for seven years, has been from
16 s. to 18 s. per boll, 9 stone weight in the boll.

   Cattle.-The breed of horses is much improved of late.
Every farmer has a cart or carts, according to the size of his
farm.  About twenty years ago there were none in the pa-
rish, except at Mount Stuart.  Black cattle are not much im-
proved, owing to their scanty feeding when young.
