with the crags on the shore, which are of a stupendous height;
and seem to have been separated by the force of the waves,
rather than by volcanoes or any other eruptions.  There is
an holm, called Dorholm, from a remarkable arch passing
through its centre, which is very lofty and spacious, and un-
der which boats fish; and there is an opening from the top,
which gives light to those below.  Next to this, is the holm
and isle of Stenness, which abound with kettywakes filling
every projection and every hole, which can afford them any
shelter.  The new fledged young, are  much esteemed, as de-
licate food, and taken in great plenty.  To the northward of
this is a rock, the summit of which, has never been trodden by
man, and is called the Maiden Skerrie.  In the summer season
it is occupied by the largest or black-backed gulls, who nestle
on it undisturbed.  About 2 miles from this shore, there is a 
large and high rock called Ocean Sherry; it is a good direc-
tion for ships from the N., if wanting an harbour.  Under it
our fishing boats, with easterly wind, are happy to reach a
place.  Which will give them leave to rest upon their oars.  On
the N. end of Rona's hill, is the island of Uya, esteemed the
most valuable, for feeding cattle or sheep, of any belonging
to this parish.  The northmost point of the parish is a small
peninsula, enclosed by a stone fence, called Fetheland; about
3 miles thence, there are high rocks called Ramnastacks.  On
the E. side of the parish, going from N. to S. are the holms
of libester, Stourholm, and the holms of Skea, with Gluss
island.

   Harbours and Fishing Stations.-On the S. side of the pa-
rish is a spacious bay, called St. Magnus Bay, which leads to
the harbour and creek of Hillswick, where there is safe and 
excellent anchorage, for any number of vessels, or of any
burthen; having good mourings from 7 to 20 fathouns water.
