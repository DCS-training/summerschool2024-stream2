red and white light, with intervals of darkness, is similar to the
light at the Bell Rock, which is so beautifully alluded to in the
following lines of Sir Walter Scott, written in the Album of that
edifice, in his visit to it in the year 1814.

                            "Phar¢s loquitur."
          "Far in the bosom of the deep,
          A ruddy gem of changeful light
          Botnd on the dusky brow of night
          The seaman bids my lustre hail,
          And scorns to strike his timorous sail."

     Each of the Northern Light-houses is furnished with a barometer,
thermometer, and rain-guage, and observations are made upon their
state every morning and evening, when the results are registered inthe columns of the returns made every month to the engineer.  A
train of such observations cannot fail to be highly interesting in
the course of time, when it is considered that the same, system is
observed in all the, Northern Light-houses, extending to the Isle of
Man, the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Zetland Isles, and the eastern
coast of Scotland.  The returns made to the engineer contain also
an account of the expenditure of oil and other stores, and notice
of any shipwrecks which occur on the neighbouring coast.  There
are two light-keepers at Corswall, who alternately mount guard
through the night, keeping watch as on shipboard.  The view from
the light-house tower is extensive and striking; comprehending
a large tract of the coast of Ireland, terminating in the Fair-Head,
Rachlin Island, the Mull and Peninsula of Cantire, Ailsa Craig,the Isle of Arran, and the Cumbraes.

                             III.--POPULATION.

in the village of Steuart-town: the rural population had not in-

50, of deaths, 30, of marriages, 14.  The following is a return
