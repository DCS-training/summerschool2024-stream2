     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF LOCHRUTTON

     (STEWARTRY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.)

     By the Rev. MR. GEORGE DUNCAN.

     Origin of the Name, Situation, and Extent.

   LOCHRUTTON derives its name from a lake of lock
the centre of the parish.  The meaning of loch is welt
known, and the word rutton is supposed to signify, in the Gae-
lic language, the straight road.  As the great road to Ireland,
through the stewartry and the county of Galloway, passes close
by the loch, it seems to have received the name of Lochrutton,
or the loch upon the straight road, from that circumstance.
The name was afterwards transferred to the whole district in
the neighbourhood.  The parish is situated in the county or
stewrtry of Kikcudbright, and is one of the ten parishes be-
longing to that stewartry, which is incorporated with the pres-
bytery and synod of Dumsries.  It is of an eliptical form and
may be computed to be four miles and a half long, from east to
west, and three miles broad from north to south.  It is bound-
ed by the parishes of Newabbey and Troquire on the south
and east, Terregles and Irongray on the north, and Urr and
Kirkgunzeon on the west.
