ground completely with a hack, an instrument with a han-
dle of about 4 or 5 feet long, and two iron prongs like a
fork:  but turned inwards.  this makes the plants rise
stronger and gives the roots room to spread, so as to yield
perhaps a hundred bolls per acre; and during the whole
progress of the plants coming forward, they make it their
business to clean the ground perfectly by hand-hoeing, which
prepares it for the succeeding crop.
   When houses cannot be had, both yams and potatoes
may be kept in temporary shades made on purpose, sloping
like the roof of a house, which may be built at small ex-
pence, of young firs and thatched, the bottom and sides well
lined with straw, and a deep trench drawn round them to 
keep them dry, with a door or opening at one end, from
which they may be taken at pleasure; but always kept
well covered to prevent access to frost.*

*The curl is a disease to which potatoes are exceedingly subject and
which, it is believed, is as yet but little understood.  A notion seems to pre-
vail that it is infectious, and that it will propagate both by roots and stems.
This year (1795) there seemed to have been, in many places, more of this
disease all over the country than had appeared for many years; and it is ob-
servable, that from the same feed, planted in different fields, the one has
abounded with curl, while the other was perfectly free. Also, in the same
field, some spots have been diseased, and others not; but the found potatoes
always were upon the driest part of the field.  From the idea of its being
infectious, directions have been given, that as soon as the curl appeared, the
diseased root should be immediately dug up and thrown away.  But, to
prove this, as soon as the curl appeared in a field belonging to the author
of this paper, he placed marks in the ground between the diseased and the
sound:  and there did not appear, through the whole season, the least symp-
tom of the disease increasing; that is, those which were not diseased when
the marks were put in, remained so to the end of the season perfectly sound.
And while the curl was prevalent in the fields, not one potatoe, planted in
the garden, had the least appearance of disease.  Mentioning these circum-
stances to a very ingenious gentlemen, he gave it as his opinion, that this
disease does not proceed from the feed, and that it is not infectious; but
that it is owing principally to wet soil, rainy seasons, or an error in cultiva-
