in the parish:-That nearly one eighth of them are under fix
years of age:-That there is a dog, a clock, or a watch, for
every house in the parish:-That there is a cart, or a plough,
for every house:-And that there is nearly one horse, and
more than three cows, for every boule in it.  The cows are
very productive.  The produce of one cow has brought the
owner 10 L.  Sterling in the year.-There is only 1 four wheel-
ed carriage in the parish.-There is a threshing machine, which,
with 4 men and 3 horses, will thresh from 8 to 10 bolls each
hour.-The oldest man in the parish is 94 years of age.  There
are 2 men still alive, both of the name of William Gray, who
have been each married to their present wives 58 years.-
There was a working mason in this parish, whose wife brought
him 18 children; and a noble lady has born 23 children to
one husband.-The people here are not fond of a seafaring
