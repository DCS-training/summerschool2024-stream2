of its banks; part of it from Menstry dam to Sauchie, a space
of three miles by the river, is dead water, except at two pla-
ces, of no great extent, the Westhaugh and Coble Crook
fords, which together have a fall of about 3 feet that may be
removed, and this part of the river made the channel of na-
vigation.
   Menstry dam is situated a mile and three quarters above
the quay of Cambus, and about the same distance from the
port of Manor.  The surface of the water is 17 1/2 feet, above
neap tides, and 14 feet above spring tides, high water.  The
channel of the Devon from this dam to Cambus is perplexed
with dams and shallow places where the bottom is rock.
   Above Sauchie, the channel of Devon is unfit for naviga-
tion, being obstructed by gravel fords brought in by the ri-
vers, but a canal can be cut on the south side of it from Sau-
chie to the Rack-mill, a space of four miles.  Twenty-three
feet of lockage are required to raise this stretch of the canal
to the level of the surface of the Devon near the Rack-mill,
but at least three feet more will be necessary to carry it over
the intermediate grounds.
   The commodities principally wanted in the extensive coun-
tries upon the upper Forth, are lime and pit-coal.  The con-
sumption of both these articles is very great, and would be
much greater were the expence of carriage lower.  They
could most readily be supplied with the coal from the exten-
sive seams of that mineral which ly upon the Devon, from
the Coble Crook to the Rack-mill; many of which are level-
free, but at present they can have no communication with
these coallieries but by land carriage, and must supply them-
selves at a higher rate either at Bannockburn or at Stirling
shores to the last of which, coals are brought by the tideway
from Alloa, and the coalleries situated farther down the
Forth, where they must be wrought at the export prices.
