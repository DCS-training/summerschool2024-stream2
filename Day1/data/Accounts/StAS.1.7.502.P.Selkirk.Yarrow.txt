   Sheep, Horses, and Black Cattle.-The sheep constitute the
chief part of the animal productions of this parish, and are
of a superior quality, in point of good carcase and delicate
taste.  The horses and black cattle do not rise above medio-
crity.  Their respective numbers, as nearly as can be ascer-
rained, are as follows; sheep, 55,000; horses, 149; black
cattle, 545.

   Wool.-The wool is of various qualities.  In the lower
part of the parish, it is of a considerably fine texture, and
sells at the rate of 18 s. the stone.  In the upper part, it is
of a very coarse pile, and does not bring more than 6 s. or
7 s.  For a great series of years, the sheep farmers paid no
attention to this valuable article.  Their chief study was to
produce a good carcase, rather than a fine fleece.  Hence
the coarse black faced kind of sheep constituted their prin-
cipal store.  Of late years, however, their system of rearing
sheep hath undergone a considerable alteration, particularly
in the lower district of the parish.  Induced by the high
price of fine wool, the farmers in this quarter are gradually
quitting the old species, and introducing the Cheviot breed.
For this purpose, they are at great pains every season to pro-
cure tups of a fine quality.  Nor have their laudable efforts
to improve their stock of sheep been unrewarded.  Some,
who began early their career of improvement, have trebled
the price of their wool.  Others again, who were later in
their commencement, have doubled it.  But these improve-
ments are solely confined to the farms about and below the
church.  All above remain in their former unimproved state.
Still the old breed of sheep are reared, whose wool is of the
coarsest kind, and little adapted for manufacture.  Although
convinced of the great advantage resulting from rearing the
Cheviot species, yet the farmers there are afraid to try the
