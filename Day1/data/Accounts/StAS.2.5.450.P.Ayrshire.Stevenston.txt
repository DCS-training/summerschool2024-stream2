   Botany.--When we consider that about 1200 acres are nearly
covered with drifting sand, and that the rest of this little parish is so
rich and valuable, that as much as possible of it is in a state of
cultivation, one would not expect that it would afford much scope
for the botanist. He might make out a list, however, that might
stand comparison with the Flora of parishes of far greater pro-
mise. But we regret, that from the nature of this publication, and
the space already occupied, only a very few out of the long list of
phenogamous and cryptogamous plants can be inserted.

   There is a good deal of wood round the mansions of the re-
sident heritors. The finest trees in the parish are those that form
the old avenue leading to Grange, and originally to the ancient
Castle of Kerilaw. But though the trees in general are not of
great antiquity, the plantations are pretty extensive around Ardeer
and Sea Bank, and still more around Grange; so that the parish
when viewed from the shore or from the sea, has a remarkably rich,
clothed, comfortable appearance.
   The aspect of the parish, indeed, from several points of view, is
remarkably pleasing. One of the best views of it is, as you ap-
