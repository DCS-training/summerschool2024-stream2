the parish on or near the coast, that have not been cultivated,
seem evidently to have been the scenes of battles, as they are
full of tumuli, containing human bones.

   Rivers, Bridges, etc-Several small streams from the
neighbouring mountains and glens fall into the Loch of Bro-
ra: The most considerable of them is a small river that runs
from the N. W. taking its rise in the forest of Clebria in the
parish of Far, and, passing through the north part of the pa-
rish of Rogart, is called the Water of Shiberscross; and an-
other stream rises at the N. E. from the forest of Binormine,
in the extremity of this parish, both which meet at a village
called Kilphidder More, and fall together into the northmost
end of Loch Brora.-There are no bridges worth mention-
ing, on any of the numerous burns or rivers in the parish,
except one on the river at Brora, about a furlong above the
place where it falls into the sea on the high road to Caithness
and Orkney.  Even this bridge, important as it is to the
public, is in a state of great disrepair.  The sea at full tide
runs up in the river far above the bridge; ands at low water,
it is four fathoms deep immediately below it.

   Mines, Minerals, etc.-There seem to be mines of coal on
the coast; pits of which have been at different times opened at
Brora, and wrought as far back as the reign of Queen Eliza-
beth, as well as at different periods since, when coal has been
found and exported to different places on the Murray and
Cromarty Friths.  All along the coast there are rocks of free-
stone, whence the hewn-stone work of all the houses in the
neighbourhood, as well as grave-stones and pavement, are
quarried.  There are likewise quarries of limestone in the
parish; one of them in a hill far above the level of the sea,
and about a mile distant from the shore, which abounds with
