prospects.  From some places is beheld the course of the
Tay, for 18 or 20 miles; a noble piece of water, and
a scene often enlivened by numbers of vessels under sail,
and fishing boats.  From the same eminences, the wind-
ings of the Earn, through the mouth of that pleasant
strath or valley to what it gives name, are also a beau-
tiful object.  From the another point, opens at once to the
view, the whole fertile plain of the Carse of Gowrie,
bouded by a sweep of hills, which fall back on the N.,
and by the Frith of Tay on the S.; the prospect termi-
nating to the E. with the steeple of Dundee, Broughty
Castle, and the mouth of the Tay, where it enters the
German Ocean.
   The soil is various.  The banks of the river are co-
vered with a strong clay, capable, with proper culture,
of carrying the heaviest crops.  The grounds rising to-
wards the hills consist of an easy black mould, in many
places deep and rich, even at a considerable height.  In
the level part of the parish, an the E. side, same
kind of soil is, in some places, mixed with clay; in
others, with sand.  The lands under cultivation are, in
general, good and fertile:  the uncultivated parts are
mostly covered with plantations; so that there is not much
waste ground within the parish.

   Air.-The air is exceedingly pure and healthful.  The
dryness of the grounds, and the strong currents of west-
erly wind which often blow, as through a funnel, be-
tween the hills of Kinnoul and Moredum, probably con-
tribute to purify the air, and to render it salubrious.
No local distempers are known to prevail here; nor are
epidemical infections either common, or remarkably
fatal.
