Increase,                                           85

   I cannot account for this increase, as there has not been
any manufacture introduced; it is, notwithstanding, a matter
of fact, that the population here has been increasing for fifty
years back.

   The stipend consists of money only, which, with the value
of the glebe, makes the living amount to 80 l. sterling.  There
have been no experiments made to ascertain the most profi-
table mode of managing the glebe.  The same system which
prevails invariably in this country was always followed; and
that is, to have part under corn and hay, and part in pasture.
At the same time, it appears to me clearly demonstrable from
calculation, and it is conformable to experience, that no crop
should be raised in Skye at all, but hay alone.  Nature has
evidently intended this country for pasture; and, of course,
cattle should be our chief care.  The climate is so unsteady,
that our expectations from crop are very commonly frustra-
ted; and the expence of making that crop exceeds the re-
turns even when they are most flourishing.
