   Runrig formerly.-There is properly no village in the
parish.  About 40 years ago, the farm houses lay together
in clusters, from the ancient policy of self-defence against
depredators, and from the conveniency of keeping the
cattle on common pasture.  The farms lay in runrig, that
is, each field was divided into as many parts or ridges as
there were farmers in the village; by which the good and
bad land was equally divided among all; and in winter, or
when in grass, all the ground was common pasturage.  Dif-
ferent properties were thus occupied, as well as different
farms on the same property.  A multiplicity of interfering
interests discouraged any attempt at a change.  There was
not then, nor indeed could there be, any winter turnip,
sown grass, or wheat; neither was there any fallow nor
potatoes.  Lord Privy Seal, whose property lay by itself,
was the first that divided and inclosed his farms separately.
He was next followed by the owners of Cupar-grange,
originally distributed among twelve possessors; but eleven
parts of the twelve were now become one property.  After
which, the Grange of Aberbothtry was divided; originally
the equal property of eight, now of six persons unequally.
There were formerly balks between the ridges; there was
no grass private property but what grew on the balks.
There are now no balks.  Formerly they ploughed with
eight oxen, or with four oxen and two horses before them
at present they plough entirely with horses, commonly
two in a plough.  What corn they had was not much in-
ferior to what grows at present.  They ploughed always
deep, cleaned the ground in the spring, and dunged it
for barley.  The whole of the dung was laid on the infield.
The outfield, which was the greater proportion, never got
any dung.  It yielded a crop now and then, after lying
several years in grass, or rather in a state of nature; the
crop was private property, but the grass was common pas-
