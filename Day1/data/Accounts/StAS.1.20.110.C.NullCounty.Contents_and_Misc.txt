   which have sent returns,               87,041 11   1     7,380      32,010      47,464
3. Stock in the remaining parishes

   That is, at the rate of 33 English acres per horse; 8 ditto per head of
cattle; 4 1/2 ditto per sheep.

     The value of the stock may be thus stated:

<TABLE>

21,448 Horses, of all ages, at L. 6.              L. 128,688      0      0
 89,074 Cattle, young and old, at L. 3, 10 s.         311,759      0      0
164,171 Sheep, at 5 s.                                 41,042      15     0 
Hogs, (which are pretty numerous), deer, goats,
  rabbits, poultry, pigeons, etc.                      40,000      0      0

                                     Total,        L. 581,489     15      0 

</TABLE>

   Of these, it is supposed, that 20,000 head of cattle, and 26,000 sheep,
are annually sold out of the country, and it is well known, considerable
quantities of salted port are exported.
   This table must satisfy every one of the great advantage that might be
derived from the improvement of live-stock.  Though there are considerable
numbers of valuable animals of the different sorts above mentioned, yet the
average price, young and old included, cannot with justice be stated at
more than the small sums above mentioned.  Whereas, by attending to the
improvement of the different breeds, the same pasture might seed animals
of much superior value

     IV. Agricultural Produce

   We shall next proceed to give a general view of the profit derived from
the cultivation of the soil, in the manner above specified, and from the stock
above enumerated.
