   Hills, Woads, etc.-The hills in the N. E and W. end of
the parish are partly rocky, but, upon the whole, it cannot be

The heaviest rains come by the S. and S. W. winds in summer

scarcity of fuel, damp houses, and the people wearing the same

the climate cannot be called unhealthy.  There are several in the
