   Manners and Morals.-A tolerable degree of industry pre-
vails in the parish, and the morals of the people are as good
as throughout the country at large.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The great disadvantage
under which the parish labours, is wetness in almost all sea-
sons, particularly in seed time and harvest.  Coils abound in
the parish, and are to be had both in it, and the east cart of
Shotts almost adjoining to it, at 6 d. per load, weighing two
and a half cwt.  Lime is easily driven from the neighbour-
ing parishes of Bathgate and Livingstone, as the high roads
from Glasgow to Edinburgh, and from Borrowstounness to
Cleugh, run through the parish in opposite directions.  Free-
stone quarries are open in several parts of the parish.
   Edinburgh affords a ready market for most of the pro-
duce of the farms, as calves, poultry, cheese, and butter,
which are bought up, and taken there by carriers.  There
is also a considerable traffic in milk cows, to supply the
Edinburgh cow-feeders.  The parish and neighbourhood
abounds with dealers in black cattle.  These dealers, by re-
quiring grass parks to hold the cattle they have on hand,
give great encouragement to inclosing and planting.  For
such parks as are tolerably fenced and sheltered, they pay
from 15 s. to 25 s. per acre.  Many people in the parish
make a livelihood by keeping a horse and cart, with which
they drive grain from Leith and Datkeith to Glasgow, and
often bring a load of pig-iron, in returning, from the iron
works lately established in that neighbourhood.
