ther by the injudicious management of the land after laying
that useful manure upon it.  For although, of all calcareous
manures, lime is unquestionably the best, yet as it acts rather
as a stimulus than a substantial manure, and causes the land to
make its greatest exertions in the way of vegetation, it has a
tendency to exhaust the soil, if not cropped with caution.
When it was first employed in the cultivation of the lands of
this parish, little attention was paid to this circumstance.  The
difficulty of driving lime at the distance of 16 or 17 miles
through very bad roads, induced the farmers to take as many
crops as the land would yield, to refund them for their expence
and trouble.  And by these means after taking eight or nine crops
of oats successively, it was commonly left in a state of total
sterility, incapable of producing either grass or corn.  This
pernicious practice is now in a great measure land aside; and
the generality of the farmers discover equal skill and caution both
in the mode of managing and cropping the lands which they
improve with lime, and also in the means which they use for
recovering what had formerly been impoverished by over-crop-
ping.

   Horses, Cattle, and Sheep.-There are about 30 horses, 200
black cattle, and 3500 sheep in the parish.  The horses are all
kept for the purposes of husbandry.  There are few bred in the
parish, and none at all for sale.  The cattle are but of a in all
kind; are bred for sale, and bring from L. 4:10 to L. 5:5
a head when three years old.  The sheep, which are of the
small black faced kind, are sold lean after they are three years
old.  The average price for some years past is from 9 to 10 
guineas the score.  The farmers seem to think that this kind of
sheep is mostsuitable to the pasture, and have on that account
made no attempts to improve the breed.  They carry a coarse
