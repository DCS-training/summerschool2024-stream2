cile of the lands of Ferrintosh, for the sum of 400 merks
Scotch, subject, as explained by a posterior act, to a pro-
portion of any additional duties of excise, that might
thereafter be imposed by law upon the kingdom.  This
privelege his successors enjoyed without interruption, till
the year 1786.  As a mark of public favour, it was not
more honourably acquired at first, than it was amply me-
rited afterwards, by a continued succession of important
services in their country's cause.  In 1715, the original
granter's son, adhering to the principles of the Revolution,
raised all the men upon his estates, and deeply impaired
his private fortune, by keeping them in arms at his own
expence, till that rebellion was happily quelled.  The ser-

and ornament of his country, the Honourable Duncan For-

he applied himself with zeal to nip it in the bud.  He
successively invited the chieftains to Culloden house, and

sands from joining the Pretender's standard.  His exertions
at that critical conjuncture, whilst they brought his own
liberty, and even his life into imminent hazard, involved
his family in a debt, double to that with which he had
found it loaded, from his predecessor's zeal in the same
cause, and amounting together to upwards of L.30,000
Sterling.  About two thirds of that sum, and less than 16
years purchase of its proven increasing value, was the al-
lowance made by Government to the present proprietor,
on their resumption of this immunity in the year 1786.-
