last century than at present.  It appears from the register of
baptisms, that the number of births, taking them at an average
for 7 years preceeding 1684, amounted annually to 199, which
supposes a population of about 600 inhabitants.  This de-
cline of population is chiefly to be ascribed to the engrossing
of farms, for it is an undoubted fact that the inhabitants of
the town have increased within the last 40 years.  The return
to Dr. Webster in 1755, however, amounting only to 3975
souls, it would appear, that the total decrease, since that pe-
riod, has not been considerable.  It is farther to be remarked,
that in 1692 the parish of Gladsmuir was erected, which was
made up of lands taken from the parishes of Haddington, Tra-
nent, and' Aberlady, and that the lands, taken from Haddington
now contains from 500 to 600 souls.

   Soil, Rent, etc.-The western part of the parish consists of
a large tract of muirish ground of about 1000 acres, called
Gladsmuir, formerly possessed by the burgh as a commonty.
The rulers of the burgh were advised about 60 years ago to
inclose and plant it, and had they done so it must have yield-
ed a considerable revenue; but instead of complying with this
advice, it was seued out in small parcels to favourite citizens,
who after all were generally losers by their grants; for after
expending a good deal of money in inclosing, liming etc. the
lands for the most part proved sterile and unproductive.  On
the failure of the original seuars, great part of the commonty
has been acquired by Mr. Buchan of Letham, who has plant-
ed many acres of it with oack, fir, birch, etc. which are in gene-
ral in a thriving condition, and in a few years will be of great va-
lue.  The barony of Bytes has always been esteemed one of the sin-
est estates of its extent in the whole county, it pertained for ma-
ny centuries to a noble family of the name of Lindsay, ancestors
to the present Earl of Crawford, from whom it was acquired
