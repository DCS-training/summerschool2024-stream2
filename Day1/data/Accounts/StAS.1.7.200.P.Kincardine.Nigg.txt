tide along the lower part of the harbour, and round the
coast, and Mr Menzies that up the river, and inland.  He
has now let his grounds in the following manner:  Divided
into small lots, from 10 L. to 30 L. some of which are taken
in lease together, and some even subdivided.  The tenants
are obliged to do something in inclosing them, and to keep
part in grass and green crop.  As an incitement to meliorate
the land, the rent riles a little at the end of 9, and again at
the end of 19 years; while the temptation to exhaust it is
removed by the uncertain term of a lifetime to which the
lease extends beyond the last period.  The town-council of
Aberdeen have feued out their share in nine moderate lots,
from about 30 L. to 90 L. each.  By becoming private pro-
perty, a new spur is given to render it more valuable.  Ac-
cordingly, every feuer has made some progress in improving
his ground; and some of them, by building stone-fences,
draining and dressing the surface, as well as by laying on
lime, and erecting farm-houses and steddings, have done
much to change the face of their property.  Indeed, a spirit
of industry and improvement has gone out, and reached the
lowest cottager.  Multures and embarrassing services are abo-
lished.  Part of the formerly plowed land is regaining.  Oxen
are brought in, and reared of a larger size.  Cows are kept
to a greater number than ever; and some sheep are intro-
duced.  The population has increased from new families
coming in, and from the settlement which has taken place.
The people who, in 1787, were 1024, are now 1090.  They
are also becoming better accommodated.  Within the space
of a few years, 70 houses have been built in a substantial
manner, and suitable for the different possessors, at the ex-
pence of above 1200 L.
