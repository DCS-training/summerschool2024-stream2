                    GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

                           ON THE

             UNITED, COUNTIES OF ROSS AND CROMARTY

  The united counties of Ross and Comarty lie between 57&deg;8,
and 58&deg;.10 north latitude, and between 4&deg; and 5&deg;.46 west longitude
Exclusive of the Island of Lewis, their superficial extent is about
2424 square miles. Including that island, they form the largest
county in Scotland. They are bounded on the north by Sutherland
and the Dornoch Frith; on the south by Inverness-shire ;
on the west by the Western Ocean ; and on the east by the Moray
Trith. The breadth of the county from the extreme east at Tarbat
Ness, to the extreme west, is about 85 miles.
  The county of Cromarty is of small extent, consisting only of
one parish, that of Cromarty, and, including all its scattered pendicles,
containing about 220,800 imperial acres. Towards the
end of the seventeenth century, several detached additions were
made to this small county. This was done at the instance of the
Earl of Cromarty, then Viscount Tarbat, who desired that one
county might contain all his lands, wherever situate. These addi-
tions consist of a district surrounding Tarbat House, on the north-
ern shore of the bay of Cromarty; of a district running from the
south side of Dornoch Frith to the Moray Frith; of two fragments
of land on the north of the river Carron ; of a portion of land run-
ning northward from the town of Dingwall, and including Castle
Leod and part of Ben Wyvis; of small portions of land to the
north of Loch Fannich, and to the north of Loch Nid ; of a dis-
trict stretching along the southern shore of Little Lochbroom ; of
the large district of Coigeach between the northern shore of Loch-
broom and Sutherland; also of the Summer Islands in Lochbroom.
It is understood also that Royston or Caroline Park, about two
miles from Edinburgh, forms a portion of the county of Cromarty
  The county of Ross comprises the districts of Ardross, Easter
Ross, Ardmeanach, or the Black Isle, Kintail, Strathcarron,
