     Of Corstorphine.

   Among the present disadvantages of this parish, is reck-
oned the want of manufactures.  It is evident, from its
being not supplied with water, so necessary in the requi-
site machinery, that only certain species of manufactures
are admissible.  And the extent to which these ought here
to be introduced, appears to me to be a subject of the
last importance, but of nice and difficult discussion.  I am
not much conversant in subjects of political economy, and
it is with extreme diffidence I venture to advance any thing
on this subject, but feeling its importance, as intimately
connected with the public prosperity, and best interests of
the people, I suggest what folows:
   In this parish, agriculture is to be considered as the pri-
mary profession, and all others should be conducted with
the view of promoting its success; for it is the foundation
which supports manufactures.  That it hath not yet been
carried to the utmost point of perfection it will admit, is
not only true of this neighbourhood, but of the most cul-
tivated districts in England:  a still larger capital, a still
greater number of hands may be employed.  The improve-
ments carrying on in the fields; the change in the mode
of husbandry, by the introduction of new machinery; of
new species of grain or of seeds, and to which no limits 
can be assigned, demand the employment of a number of
people of every sex and age, in the service of the hus-
bandmen for carrying on his plans.  Formerly, hay time
and harvest were the only seasons which called forth wo-
men, and people of sedentary prosessions, but now, in the
improving system, the whole summer requires their la-
bours.  Children too, who formerly had no share in the
task, may now, at an age not very advanced, be made
useful, and contribute assistance to their parents for sup-
porting them, without impairing their vigour, of stinting
