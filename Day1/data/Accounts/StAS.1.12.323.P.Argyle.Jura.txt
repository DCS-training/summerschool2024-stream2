     Of Fura and Colonsay.

   Harbours.-There are two very fine harbours on the E.
side of the island; that to the S. is called the Small Isles; and
that to the N. the Lowland-Man's Bay They are within a
few miles of each other.  The harbour at the Small isles is a 
capacious bay, about 4 miles in extents.  Into the mouth of
this bay are thrown longitudinally 3 or 4 islands, which leave
but narrow openings into the harbour, and form a strong bar-
rier against the violence of the sea.  It is from these islands
that the harbour takes its name.  Lowland-Man's Bay opens
towards the S., is contracted at the entrance by 2 points of
land, which run out, like two arms, but is pretty capacious
within.  The harbour os Small Isles is rather shallow for ves-
sels of great draught of water, but this is deep enough for any
vessel.  Notwithstanding the excellence of these harbours,
and that Jura is only a few hours failing from the lochs where
herrings are fished, there is no vessel above 5 or 6 tons bur-
then belonging to the island, and of these there is none em-
ployed in the fisheries.  The course of the tides along the
coast of Jura, particularly in the sound of Scarba, and in that
of Ilay, is very rapid.  The navigation of the sound of Ilay is
dangerous, not only from the rapidity of the tides, running
6 miles an hour, and from the sudden squalls which come
from the neighbouring hills, but also from foul ground.  Many
vessels have been lost in this dangerous sound.  As a consider-
able number of those trading to the north seas have occasion
to pass through it, one should think that it ought to be care-
fully examined and surveyed, to see what improvements are
practicable.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls in 1755 was 1997.  To ascertain the present po-
pulation of this parish, a survey was made in June 1792.
