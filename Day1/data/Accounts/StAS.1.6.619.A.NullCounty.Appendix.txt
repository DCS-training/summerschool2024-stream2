ended at eleven, by public orders of the manager, which were
never transgressed.
   In 1783-The public assemblies met at eight and nine o'-
clock, and the Lady Directress, sometimes, did not make her
appearance till ten*.  The young Masters and Misses, who
would have been mortified not to have seen out the ball, thus
returned home at three or four in the morning, and yawned
and gaped, and complained of headachs all the next day.
   In 1790 and 1791-The public assemblies were little fre-
quented.  Private balls were much in fashion, with elegant
suppers after them, and the companies seldom parted till three
four, or five in the morning.
   In 1783-The funds of the Charity Workhouse were in-
sufficient to maintain the poor of the community entitled by
law to public charity.  The courts of law however, and all who
call themselves members of those courts, pay no poor's money,
nor lamp or guard money; although the most opulent part of
the community; whilst they send at the same time, a very great
proportion of managers to dispose of funds, to which they
do not contribute; and crowd the house with their poor, to
whose support they do not pay.  This privilege is pleaded on old
acts of parliament, at a period when the courts were ambuli-
tory:-But now that they have been stationary for near two
centuries, it is full time it were given up.  There is no such
privilege existing any where else in Britain.  The courts of law
in London claim no such exemption; nor would it be allowed
if they did.  The regulations and customs of Henry VIII.
would ill accord with the present state of England.
