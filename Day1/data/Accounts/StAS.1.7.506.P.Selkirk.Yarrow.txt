gular paction, and highly characteristic of the licentiousness
and barbarity of the age in which it was made.

   Farmers.-In former times, the farmers were much more
numerous than at present.  Several farms, which were oc-
cupied by 2 or 3 persons, are now possessed by one man,
which has occasioned a great diminution of the farmers.
Their present number amount to 40, who rent farms from
60 L. to 360 L. per annum.

   Agriculture.-This parish is not remarkable for agriculture.
Wheat is never attempted, as both the soil and climate are
unfriendly to its growth.  Sown grass and flax are but rare-
ly raised.  Barley, oats, pease, potatoes, and turnips, are the
chief crops produced, and these but in small quantities.  The
number of acres annually employed in raising these may be
estimated at 1000.  The remainder of the parish consists
wholly of sheep pasture.  But what may be the quantity of
acres it contains in wholes cannot be accurately defined, as a
complete measurement has never taken place.  Calculating
upon the number of sheep, horses, and cattle, maintained by
it, they cannot be less than 60,0000.

   Seed-time and Harvest.-In favourable seasons, the farmers
begin to sow about the middle of March, and to reap about
the middle of September.  Both seed-time and harvest are
often, however, by reason of the prevalency of rains and
colds in this country, much later.  April is sometimes con-
siderably advanced before sowing commences, and Novem-
ber is frequently far gone before the crops are all cut down
and lodged in the barn-yard.

   Imports and Exports.-Owing to the little arable land in
