                 V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Market-Town, &c.-Biggar, the nearest market-town, is distant
three miles; it is also the nearest post-town.  The length of
turnpike roads in the parish is about four miles.  A coach run-
ning between Edinburgh and Dumfries passes through the parish.
There is one bridge over the Clyde, which joins the parishes of
Culter and Symington, and along which passes the road between
Lanark and Bigcar.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The situation of the parish church is in
the centre of the parish; and the greatest distance from it is about
a mile and a-half.  It is not exactly known when the church was
built, but it underwent extensive repairs in 1761, and an addition
was built about twenty years ago.  The old part is now going fast
out of repair.  It accommodates about 300 sitters; and about 30
of the seats are free.  The manse was built in 1790; it was re-
paired and received an addition in 1838.  The glebe is 10 acres
in extent, and the value about L.15.  The amount of the stipend
is the minimum.  Almost all the parishioners attend the parish
church.  The number of communicants is about 220.
   Education-There is but one school in the parish, the paro-
