     Statistical Account

farms in this parish sow 20, some 26 bolls, of barley yearly;
and frmo 60 to 70 bolls of oats.  But the returns are very small,
owing to an unhappy desire among the farmers of labouring
yearly too much unripe ground, that is, ground that is not
allowed age sufficient to strengthen it.  There is both rock
and moss marl in Lismore in great quantities, and also some
in Appin.  This the tenants often use with too liberal a hand,
to the great detriment of such ground as is not allowed age
enough.  But the invincible impediment to cultivation in ge-
neral (besides the obstruction given by the rocks to the
plough in Lismore) is want of fuel to burn lime.  Peats are
the only fuel in both parishes.  The process of making them
in Lismore is difficult beyond conception, as they are first
tramped and wrought with men's feet, and then formed by
the women's hands.  There is a necessity for this; because
the substance of which they are made contains no fibres to
enable them to cohere or stick together.  This tedious o-
peration consumes much of the farmer's time, which, in a
grain country, might be employed to much better advantage;
and affords serious cause of regret that the coal-duty is not
taken off, or lessened, which would remove the everlasting
bar to the success of the fishing villages, and to improvements
in general over all the coasts of Scotland.  It may be aver-
red, with some degree of confidence, that, unless the coast-
duty be in some shape altered, the fishing villages, justly con-
sidered at present such flattering national objects, must be
laid aside.  Grain is not so strong here as in the south, ow-
ing to the inceffant rains.  Lime would perhaps, in some
measure, remedy this evil.
