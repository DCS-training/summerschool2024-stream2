of moneys the whole being done at the proprietor's expence.
   The possessions are laid off in the manner best fitted for
the operations; and are divided by lanes running in straight
lines parallel to each other.  Parallel to these again the drains
are carried; and this straight direction greatly facilitates the
progress of the water with its load of moss.  Upon the bank
of moss fronting the lanes, the operation of floating is be-
gun; and twenty or thirty people are sometimes seen heaving
moss into the same drain.  That the water may be the more
conveniently applied, the lanes include between them the
breadth of two possessions only.  The new houses are erected
upon each side of these lanes at the distance of 100 yards
from each other.
   Before the formation of lanes and roads, and while yet no
ground was cleared, the first settlers were obliged to erect
their houses upon the surface of the moss.  Its softness denied
all access to stones; which, at any rate, are at such a distance
as would render them too expensive.  Settlers, therefore, were
obliged to construct their houses of other materials.  Upon
the Low Moss there is found for this purpose great plenty of
sod or turf, which accordingly the tenants use for the walls of
their houses.  For the rudeness of the fabric nature in some
measure compensates, by overspreading the outside with a
luxuriant coating of heath and other moorish plants, which
has a very picturesque appearance.
   But upon the High Moss there is no sod to be found.  There
the tenant must go differently to work.  Having chosen a
proper situation for his house, he first digs four trenches down
to the clay, so as to separate from the rest of the moss a solid
mass, containing an oblong, rectangular area, sufficiently large
for his intended house.  This being done, he then scoops out
the middle of the mass, leaving on all sides the thickness of
