		    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

	The yearly rent of the whole parish in 1714, amounted to
L.284, 4s. 6 2/3d. Sterling: in 1792 it was L.385, 12s.: in 1832
it was L.984 Sterling. A number of the farms which bave been
lately let have been raised to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 times the former
rent. Some of them let within these twelve years are from 10 to
25 per cent. above the real value, considering that the price of
cattle, wool, and sheep, has fallen more than one-half since that
time.
