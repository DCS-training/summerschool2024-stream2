exceedingly well.  In this way of sowing turnip, of
which, from a too well founded apprehension of secret
consumption, the quantity raised annually in Govan is
inconsiderable, he is pretty generally followed, and in
the planting of potatoes, universally.  He always gave
a preference to broad drills*; but in that has not been
followed, though a gentleman, who is one of the most
intelligent farmers in the parish, and who was particu-
larly acquainted with the sherrif, is clearly of opinion.
that they not only yield as profitable crops as the broad+
drills, but are greatly more beneficial to the ground.  In
this parish, there in not less than 250 acres planted with
potatoes every year; and of these, the average produce
is 35 bolls the acre.  The ordinary rotation of crops is
potatoes, wheat laid down with grass-seeds for 2 years,
and then oats.  Some sow barley, others oats after
wheat, and lay them down with grass.  Beans and pease
are not brought into the rotation, except in the higher
grounds, where the soil, generally tending to clay, is
more favourable for their production.  The best ++ farm-
ers have, some seasons, 13 bolls of wheat upon an acre;
but that is considerably above the average quantity.
Flax is sown only for private use.  The havest is usually-
ly early; and frequent showers during the summer are,
in the low grounds, always succeeded by the richest
crops.
   The draught horses in this parish, are mostly above
the common size.  The mode of farming generally prac-
tised renders this necessary.  Not to speak of the heavy
carts of dung brought out of Glasgow, the plough used
