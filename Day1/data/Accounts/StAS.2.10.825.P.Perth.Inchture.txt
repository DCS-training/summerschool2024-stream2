  Ale-houses.-There are 11 public-houses in this parish, exclu-

  Besides the provision made for the education of poor children
already adverted to, there were several sums of money mortified
by the Rev. James Beatson, and which are entitled "Beatson's

amounted to L.378. The sum of L.30 was mortified by the mo-
ther of the Rev. James Beatson, the interest of which was to be a
stated annual fund, providing a salary for a Sabbath-school teacher
in the parish of Dunbarny.
