     Statistical Account

The old ones are little esteemed; but the young are reckoned
extremely delicate.  As there is no way, however, of getting
to their nests, but by descending from the top of the rock, by
the assistance of a rope, no person in this parish has attempt-
ed to catch any of them for many years past.  A few eagles
a variety of hawks, ravens, crows, and wild pigeons, likewise
hatch in the rocks.  The other birds most common in the
parish, are plovers and grouse; but the latter are not in great
abundance.

   Wild Quadrupeds.-Otters are occasionally found in Dunnet
Head; and seals often frequent the shores, but not in so great
numbers as in many other parts of the county.  The only
ravenous animals here are foxes and weasels.  There are a
good many hares in different parts; and the sandy ground, in
the neighbourhood of Dunnet Bay, would make a good rab-
bit warren, if they were preserved: But, as they expose the
sand to driving, by breaking the ground, the proprietor al-
lows every person to shoot them, without restriction.  It has
not, however, been possible wholly to extirpate them, though
they do great mischief.  Some of them have found their way
into Dunnet Head, where they would probably multiply ra-
pidly, were they not a prey to the foxes and eagles.

   Climate and Diseases, etc.-The climate varies according to
the distance from the sea.  Along the Pentland Frith the air
is generally temperate in summer, and cold and sharp in win-
ter; but snow seldom continues upon the ground, for any
great length of time.  Towards the S.E., or more inland
parts of the parish, the frosts are much keener in winter; and
the corns are more liable to be hurt by hoar frosts, in spring
and autumn.  The village, or rather farm, of DUNNET, situated
to the E. of Dunnet Head, and to the N, E. of the Bay, has a
