    The Messrs Handasyde have long enjoyed a high reputation as
florists.  Their collection of Dahlias, for choice varieties of which
they have repeatedly obtained prizes from the Edinburgh Horti-
cultural Society, has for some years past outrivalled those of all
competitors; and it may serve to show the spirit and enterprise
with which they engage in the cultivation of flowers, to state the
fact, that, a few years ago, they obtained possession of the only
specimen of the white Verbena then in Great Britain, at a cost of
not less than fifty guineas.
    The trees which appear best adapted to the soil are the ash,
oak, elm, plane, beech, and other deciduous kinds.  Compara-
tively few of the pine tribe have been planted.  The Acacia, of
which there are a considerable number, seems to thrive well.  It
may be proper here to state, that, at the east entrance to Buc-
cleuch Park, by Smeaton Gate, there are seven magnificent ce-
dars of Lebanon, remarkable not less for their great size, than for
the graceful symmetry of their shape
