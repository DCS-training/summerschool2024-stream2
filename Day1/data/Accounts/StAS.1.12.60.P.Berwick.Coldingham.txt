   The greatest part of the lands in this parish have been en-
closed within these last thirty years, (if we except the com-
mon moor), generally by ditch and hedge, and some with
stone-fences; and there is little doubt of the whole being en
closed in a few years hence, (with the above exception).
Thorn hedges thrive well here, so do trees of all sorts; but
our artificial plantations are few.  There are a good many na-
tural woods, near the head of the water of Eye.  They con-
sist chiefly of oak, hazel, and birch.  Some parts of these woods
are let to tanners, who peet and carry off the bark of the oak
trees, and fell the timber to farmers.  The brushwood and
loppings are bought for fuel.
