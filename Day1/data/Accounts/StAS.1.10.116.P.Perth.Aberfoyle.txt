approach the beauty of marble.  It is used for manure; but,
as the access is difficult, the use of it is principally confined
to the tenants of the Duke of Montrose, the proprietor.
The western side of this range of mountains, after the inter-
vention of immense masses of granites consists of state, of
good quality, which is wrought whenever there is a demand
for it.  The want of water-carriage, however, and the dis-
tance of a market, render the consumpt very inconsiderable.
   Before we quit the account of the general aspect of this
district, it may be observed, that it is one of those which
may furnish the naturalist with a proper field for decisive
conclusions with regard to the original structure, and the
subsequent changes of our terrestrial globe.  A lengthened
track of country, bounded on every side by lofty mountains,
traversed through its whole length by a river, now become
considerable by the accession of numberless streams, and
which, after losing itself, from time to time, in extensive
lakes, at length bursts out by a narrow passage into a great
plain, seems to promise a fair exhibition of the real effects
that are to be attributed to running water, that universal
agent, as some modern philosophers account it, in changing
the superficial aspect of our earth.
   In contemplating this, and simliar scenes which occur eve-
ry where in the Highlands, one cannot help observing, that,
had the great excavations between the mountains been occa-
sioned by the gradual attrition of the running waters, the ef-
fects produced must have been much more considerable, than
the formation of a few scanty spots of fertile soil in the sub-
jacent valleys.  Here, too, the pointed argument of De Luc
must occur with great force, that the filling up of the inter-
vening lakes must have been one of the earliest effects of the
copious deposit from the mountains.  In all these lakes the
current is altogether imperceptible.  In them therefore, the
