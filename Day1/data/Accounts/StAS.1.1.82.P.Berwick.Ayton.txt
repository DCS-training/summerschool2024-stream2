more than compensated by the quantity.  On rich lands
even the small kind of sheep would increase in size, and their
wool become more plentiful, though of an inferior quality.
The wool fells from 12 s. to 15 s. per stone.  Oxen here are
commonly fed till they weigh from 60 to 100 stone.

   Fish-The water of Eye contains good trouts, but not in
any quantity.  Cod, ling, haddocks, whitings, flounders, hol-
lyback, mackrell, and other kinds of fish, are caught here in
their seasons.  Lobsters yield considerable profit; they are
chiefly bought up for the London market.  Herrings have
been got in great quantities; but they, as well as the other
kinds of white fish, have failed much for these two years past.
The fishermen have lately discovered the method of catching
turbot, which brings a good price.

contained about 320 souls, and the country part of the parish
about the same number.  In 1773 the village contained about
360 souls:  The numbers in the country part were also in-
creased.  In 1780 the number of the inhabitants amounted to
1146, of which 420 were in the village, and 726 in the country
part of the parish.  In the present year, 1790, the number a-
mounted to 1245.  The village contains 147 families; there are
202 males and 229 females above ten years of age, and 51 males

the parish contains 136 families, which consist of 263 males
and 310 females above 10, and 53 males and 90 females be-
low 10.  From this statement it may be remarked, that dur-
ing the last ten years the population of the village has re-
ceived an addition of 109, while the country part of the pa-
rish has suffered the decrease of 10 in its numbers.  On the
