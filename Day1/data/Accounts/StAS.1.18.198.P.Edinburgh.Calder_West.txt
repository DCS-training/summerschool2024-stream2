     Statistical Account

   Parish Register.-No precise account can be given from
the session records of marriages, or births, or funerals.

   Diseases, etc.-The only diseases peculiar to this parish are
fluxes, and intermitting fevers, in the end of autumn.  There
are very few instances of inoculation, and the reason against
it, is altogether the religious one, of not bringing on diseases
before the appointed time.  This parish is sufficiently healthy,
and there may be alive at present about 8 persons from eighty
to ninety years of age.

   Poor Funds.-The funds for supplying the poor of this
parish arise from the weekly collections, from the mort-cloth
money, from 2 s. 6 d. given at each marriage, and from the
interest of a bond for L. 100.  The mort-cloth and mar-
riage money, have been nearly the same for fifty years part.
The following table will show the increase of collections since
the year 1743.  The sum following the different years, is for
six months in the summer and autumn.
