and a peck of mixed meal, at an average, to each person.  But
for brose, a dish much used, they keep some of their oatmeal
unmixed.  A man and his wife, without children, need 2
pecks of oat-meal, and halft a pect of bear meal, if they have
a cow.  Where they have no cow, they use from half a
peck to 2 pecks of malt weekly, according to the number of the
family, and the nature of the man's employment.  In general,
the day- labourers are in much better circumstances, than those
who have large crofts; and good mechanics can afford to live
better, than the farmers in this district.  The greatest difficul-
ty they experience, is that of getting their small pieces of land
plowed, as ploughs are very scarce.

   Manufactures.-  The knitting of stockings, is the principal
manufacture of this district.  It is carried on by almost all the
women, and by many boys and old men.  Different manu-
factures, from Aberdeen bring out wool, and give to the
people, from 10 d. to 2 s. a pair for working it.  A woman will
make from 3 d, to 3 1/2 a day, and do some little things about
her house, at the same time.  Or the can work at her stock-

grafts between the ridges, which are not uncommon in this
district.  On the whole, however, this employment  is too fe-
dentary, and gives too little exercise for the body.-  Since
the introduction of loom-stockings, the knitting or netting of
stockings with wires, has been on the decline; and, as the
Germans are our great rivals in this manufacture, and the
price of labour is cheap there, a peace with Germany always
reduces greatly the price of this commodity.  At present, the
price is low; and, as the principal manufacturers must give
from 10 to 12 monts credit to Dutch merchants, this branch
of commerce is falling off, and must decline more and more,
as it seems to be conducted on bad principles.-  The former
