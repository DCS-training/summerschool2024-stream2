   present, but a coarse kind of bent, it would add greatly to the
   beauty of the landscape and the mildness of the climate.
      Fisheries.-Tbere are three different kinds of fisheries regular-
   ly prosecuted in the parish, the salmon, herring, and white or had-
   dock fishery.  The first has been successfully carried on for roacy
   years.  The great flood of August 1829 so altered thecourse of the
   river at its confluence with the sea, that, forsome seasons afterwards,
   it yielded not the same return as b6fore, but now it is returning
   again to its wonted state of productiveness.  On an average there
   are 600 boxes of fish, packed with ice, each containing 34 lbs.,
   and worth L.5 Sterling, annually shipped for tl4e London market.
   The fish is caught partly by drag, still, bag, stake-not, and yair.  The
   price here, from 1st February to the 1st June is 1s. 6d. per lb. for
   salmon, and 1s. for grilses, and -from Ist June to 1st August 1s.
   for the former, and 6d. for the latter.  The rent for the whole
   river, bay, and sea fishing is L.1180. The herring-fishery, which
   is next, if not first in importance to the parishioners, has also been
   prosecuted with various succascs for the last twenty years.  The
   fishermen are sixty in number, and during the last ten years up-
   wards of 20,000 barrels of herrings have been caught by them, for
   which they have been paid on an average, at the rate of the least
   8s. 6d. per barrel, making the sum received by them for that pe-
   riod L. 8500, while the time spent,eacb season in earning their
   gains seldom exceeds seven weeks. The boats are of large di-
   mensions, and will carry from eight to ten tons weight.  The her-
   rings are of a good quality, and a large kind, and the meshes of
   the nets by which they are caught are about 1 1/8 to 1 1/4 inches in
   size, and the length of the drift with which the boats are equipped
   varies from 380 to 400 fathoms.  The white or haddock fishery is
   likewise vigorously prosecuted by nine or ten boats, manned each
   by a crew of six men, and which, on an Beverage, bring on shore
   every day they can get to sea, from L.8 to L.9 worth of very fine
   fish, for which Forres and the surrounding country furnish a ready
   market.  The produce of this branch annually may be reckoned
   at L.2000.
      The average produce of the fishings may therefore be thus cout-
   puted:
