stowed the barony of Whittingham on the Earl of Morton in 1564,
as mentioned above.
   The ruins of the baronial residence of Penshiel are still visible.
The pend or arch of one wing of the building is still standing.
The chapel of Penshiel stood below the house in a glen still cal-
led Chapel Haugh. There seem to have been a good many build.
ings about it. It is not certain whether any religious services
have been performed in it since the Reformation.
   There are also the ruins of another religious house in this pa-
rish on the estate of Papple; but at what period it was erected,
or when it was demolished, is not now known. About twenty feet
of the height of one of its walls are still standing, covered over
with ivy. A story concerning it has been handed down from fa-
ther to son, to the present time. There was a religious house at
Friardykes in the parish of Stenton, to which the refractory priests
from Melrose were occasionally banished; and betwixt the in-
habitants of that place and Papple House, there was a frequent
intercourse. A servant of one of the monks at Friardykes had
by accident become aware of the murder of one of the nuns at
Papple by the monks; but not knowing that his master was con-
cerned, communicated to him the discovery. The master there-
upon takes measures to secure a similar fate for the servant him-
self; and the tradition bears that this was prevented by M. De
Lisle, the proprietor of Stoneypath Tower, discovering the pur-
pose of the master in a letter which the servant was carrying from
him to the master of the house of Papple.

                       III.-POPULATION.
   In the former Statistical Account, it is said, that in 1755, the
number of inhabitants in this parish was 714. In 1821, it was
750; in 1831, 715. This decrease of 35 persons was owing to
the principal resident heritor's family being in London at the
time when the list was made up, and also on account of several
houses in the village having been taken down.
