     Statistical Account

Oliphant of Roffie, there were discovered, some years ago,
certain metallic appearancs, which invited a company to
make a trial of them.  Accordingly, a trial was made, and
lead ore was discovered, containing in it a great quantity of
silver; but, unfortunately, the chief person concerned in the
undertaking failed, and the prosecution of the work ceased.

   Land Floods.-In autumn and winter, the meadows, on the
sides both of the Earn and May, are frequently overflowed.
When the Earn overflows its banks, it sometimes carries off
a great deal of the produce of the fields, if the farmers are
not sufficiently careful to have it removed to some higher
ground; but what damage is sustained in this way, is amply
compensated by the rich particles of earth, which are washed
from the hills, and deposited upon the meadows, and which
serve them, in general, instead of manure.

   Cattle, etc.-There are in this parish, at an average, 262
horses, 1222 black cattle, and 520 sheep.  There breed of
horses and cattle has of late years been improved, both by
their being better fed, and by their being mixed with a kind
which are more generous, and of a larger size.  The cattle,
in the hilly part, are rather of a smaller size than those in the
low.  But those which are fed on the banks of the May, are more
than commonly handsome, and are esteemed very good beef.
The hill cattle weigh from 30 to 40 stone, and those in
the low country from 40 to 50.  The horses, though not large,
are hardy and very well sitted for labour.  A horse in its
prime costs from L. 16 to L. 20.

   Population.-The population of the parish, so far back as
can be remembered, has been nearly stationary.  The num-
ber of souls, at present, is 978, of which 467 are males,
