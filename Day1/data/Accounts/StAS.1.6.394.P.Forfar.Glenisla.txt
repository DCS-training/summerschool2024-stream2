   Rent and Produce.-There is but a very small part of the
parish inclosed.  Indeed one of the heritors, sufficiently aware
of the advantage and propriety of improving ground covered
with heath, has inclosed a good many acres of muir ground,
adjacent to his house, with fir and birch trees, which present-
ly appear to be in a very thriving state.  Would his neighbours
follow his example, the country would not wear the bleak as-
fect it presently does.-The best arable land lets at about 20 s.
per acre, but to this annexed the privilege of hill pasturage.
The rent of the parish may be between L. 600 and 700 ster-
ling.  This, however, is varying every year.  The heritors,
as has been mentioned, are 54 in number, of whom about
32 s side in the parish.  It is impossible to ascertain the num-
ber of acres continued in it, the arable ground bears but an
insignificant proportion to that which is covered with health.
The plough mostly used in the upper part of the parish is the old
Scotch plough, generally drawn by 4, sometimes by 6 horses,
yoked a breast of one another;-what is peculiar, the driver
always travels backwards.  This mode, no doubt, has been a-
dopted, on account of the weakness and small size of the horses,
which are mostly of the Highland breed.-In the lower part,
the English plough is for the most part used, and is drawn by 2
horses.  One man holds and drives.

   The vegetable produce is bear and oats, no wheat is sown;
turnips, and potatoes are raised in the lower part of the parish;
in the higher part of it turnips are but now introduced, and
indeed it is impossible this crop can turn out to advantage,
while the inhabitants allow their sheep to feed promiscously

bounties, which in value may amount to 65.0175 sterling.  About 40 years a-
go, wages of a man-servant did not exceed L. 1:6.8 sterling a year with
maintenance.
