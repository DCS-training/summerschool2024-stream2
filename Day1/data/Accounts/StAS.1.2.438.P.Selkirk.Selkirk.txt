   Town.-The town of Selkirk is pleasantly situated on a
rising ground, and enjoys an extensive prospect, in all direc-
tions, especially up and down the river Etterick.  The soil a-
round it, is dry, and the harvest early.  From its open situa-
tion, and almost equal distance from both seas, it is less rai-
ny than any other part of this country.  By a measure of rain
kept accurately for ten years, and compared with one kept at
Hawkill, in the neighbourhood of Leith, for the same time,
Selkirk was found to exceed only one half inch yearly*.-
There is no place in this country so free from epidemical dis-
eases; and were the citizens equally supplied with the other
comforts of life, as with wholesome air, no town in Scotland
would produce a greater number of aged inhabitants.  There
a good many from 70 to 80, 3 at and above 90, and one died
lately at 106.
   That Selkirk, though distant from coal, is happily situated
for carrying on the woolen trade, Hawick on the one hand,
and Gailashiels on the other, clearly demonstrate.  But it is
a royal burgh, and as such, suffers in all its best interests, and
social intercourse.  To acquire political power, and not com-
mercial property, is the great object of the principal citizens.
There is, however, one exception, a considerable incle manu-
factory being very successfully carried on, by Baillie William

marriage, for which the son-in-law binds himself to give him the pro-
fits of the first Michaelmas moon.

*By a regular attention to the pluviameter, barometer and
Fahrenheit's thermometer, for ten years, the mean quantity of
rain yearly is 31 1/2 inches.  The medium heighth of the barometer
291 2/6.  The medium of heat 43 degrees.  Nor did the medium of
heat differ one degree during these ten years.
