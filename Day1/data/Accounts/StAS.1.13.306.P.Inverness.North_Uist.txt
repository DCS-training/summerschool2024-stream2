     Statistical Account

this parish will amount to a little more than 1200 tons, the
greatest part of which is in the hands of the proprietor;
150 tons belong to Mr Maclean of Boreray, and the rest to
principal tacksmen, whose leases are not yet expired.  All
the inhabitants of the parish are employed in manufactu-
ring kelp from the 10th of June till the 10th August;
excepting the principal tacksmen and their servants, with a
few tradesmen.

   Cows, Horses, and Sheep.-Though there may be about
2000 cows, yet the number exported yearly will not ex-
ceed 300, owing to the numbers that die of want, and to
distempers, to which they are here more liable than in any
other part of the Highlands.  They are sold in the month
of June at a public fair, to drovers from different countries,
at different prices, according to their value, from L. 2, 5 s.
to L. 2, 15 s. a-head; and there have been a few instances
of parcels drawing L. 3.  The risk and expense of ferrying 
cattle to the isle of Sky, make them of less value here
than in that country.  The price of a milch-cow is at an
average L. 3, 10 s.  The number of horses may amount 
at least to 1600.  Their value in general is from L. 2 to 
L. 6 excepting a few that the principal tacksmen keep for
the plough, which may be valued from L. 8 to L. 15*.

<FOOTNOTE>

that it is be feared the manufacturing of it will be given up entirely,
(to the utter ruin of the tenants of this parish), unless Government, to
encourage home-manufacture, may look upon the commodities used in the
place of it as proper objects of taxation.

   *It may be a matter of surprise, that one parish should require as many
horses as a county in some other of the kingdom.  But when it is
considered, that the sandy soil here requires a greater quantity of manure
than any other; that this manure is carried (not in carts, but in small
creels on horseback) to the distance of a mile in some places; that the
