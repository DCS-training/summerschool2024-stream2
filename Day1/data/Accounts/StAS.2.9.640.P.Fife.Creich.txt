   Parochial Registers.-The date of the earliest entry is 1668.
Marriages and baptisms appear, with a few exceptions, to have
been recorded with regularity from 1668 to the present time, and
births have frequently, but not always, been inserted. For many
years past, births have been always entered along with the bap-
tisms. There is a register of burials, along with baptisms and mar-
riages, from 1st October 1783, to 1st October 1794, after which
time the registering of burials wag discontinued, seemingly in con-
sequence of the Government tax on births,  marriages, and burials
ceasing at a time by act of Parliament to be uplifted. A regis-
ter of these who die in the parish has been regularly kept since
1817. The registers of births, marriages, and deaths, have, for the
last twenty years, been kept according to a plan recommended by
the presbytery to the different parishes within their bounds. They
are annually inspected by the committee of presbytery appointed
for the examination of the schools, and have uniformly been com-
mended for their distinctness and accuracy.
   Antiquities.-Ancient Circles of Stones.-In the spring of the
year 1816, while some workmen were employed in trenching
a piece of ground a little to the south-west of the manse, they
came to a number of stones, about eight or ten inches below
the, surface, placed in a regular form. The part of the coun-
try in which these regularly arranged stones were situated, is
very uneven. Three ridges of hills, extending in different di-
rection, terminate on the, west Norman's Law, the most ele-
vated ground in the north Fife. On the south side of the most
notthern of these ridges, and about midway between the top of
one of the hills and a small rivulet which flows along the strath,
there is a lateral shelf, upon which these stones were discovered.
This northern. ridge extends in a direction from east to  west.
