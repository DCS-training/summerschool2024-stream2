the woollen, but the material of the former would not afford
lastage for above seven vessels of an hundred tons.  Hence
both these branches of manufacture, which form the prin-
cipal staple articles of export from the port of Aberdeen,
would only employ 30 vessels, or rather afford 30 cargoes
for a vessel of that tonnage; and hence it may be accounted
for why the proportion of shipping belonging to the port of
Aberdeen is so much inferior to places in Scotland of less
trade and population.
   When it is said above, that the stocking-manufacture is
of superior quality now to what it was formerly, it is to be

the demand for these at present, and they are only sought
for by those who seek for convenience, rather than follow

   In the year 1789, a water-mill was first erected near
Aberdeen, with machinery for teasing, scrubbling, carding,

turer was obliged to import his warp-yarns from the north
of England.  The woft was chiefly spun by old women,
and that only from backings or nails, as they were not
able to card the wool.
   While the manufacture of cloth was in this situation,
