encouragement from the landed proprietors, than they at
present receive.

   State of the Poor.-There are 24 persons at present on the
list of the parish poor; and the funds to support them do not
much exceed L. 30 per annum.  This sum arises from the in-
terest of money, from parochial collections, and from some
casualities.  There have never been any legal assessments in the
parishes.  The sum for the support of such a number of poor,
is certainly small.  There are none among them, however, who
cannot work a little; and some of them only receive a small
occasional allowance, when the prices of grain are high.
There are 2 blind women on the list; and it is surprising
how much they can spin.  The severest season which has
happened here for a long time, was in 1782.  At that time,
every description of men exerted themselves to assist the poor.
A meeting of the heritors, called for the purpose, thought it
better to assess themselves, than to encroach on the parish
money lent at interest.  Different quantities of meal were
bought, and sold to the people at the common prices in a
year of plenty; and this mode of relief was continued till
the scarcity was no longer felt.
   The parish received some advantages besides, from the as-
sistance given by Government in that year, to some of the
northern counties of Scotland.  Perth-shire was included;
and Fossaway being in Perth-shire, received its proportion,
which was extremely useful; and was faithfully applied.

   Birth and Quadrupeds.-Birds, such as are common in hilly
countries, are found here.  Moorfowl, partridges, plover,
field-fare, dotterel, wild ducks, ravens, a small species of the
eagle, the kite; and in winter, wild geese.  Of quadrupeds,
there are foxes, badgers, otters, pole-cats, hares, and rabbits.
