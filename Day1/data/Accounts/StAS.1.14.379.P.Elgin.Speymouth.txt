of the better fort of the farmers raise turnips and arti-
ficial grasses, but not to the extent that could be wished.
Their general mode of cropping is, 2 crops of oats after
grass; then barley or bear (big) with dung; or, instead
of this; turnips, potatoes, and pease, and then bear;
next oats with grass seeds, or pease and rye after the
bear; and then oats with grass seeds.  The grass is cut
for hay the first 2 years; is pastured on for a year or
2 more, and then broken up for oats as before.  The
proportions for grass seeds generally used are, 12 lb. red
clover, and 5 lb. of white, with 2 bushels rye grass.
They generally find profit in adding 2 lb. more of red
clover, and half a bushel, or even a bushel of rye grass.
They have begun to add 2 or 3 lb. of rib grass, for the
sake of the pasture.  In the low grounds, near the river,
they raise some wheat, and this generally after turnips
or potatoes.  The proportion of ground under grass in
such farms, will not generally be above 1-fourth of
whole.
   This mode of farming will appear faulty from the
great proportion that is under crop.  But the practice
of the lesser farmers, who are by far the greatest num-
ber, is still more objectionable.  Their common method
is to take 2 or 3 crops of oats after ley; then bear with
dung; then a crop, partly oats, partly rye; then 2 crops
more of oats; and when the ground is now sufficiently
exhausted, to leave it out in ley or natural grass.  Some-
times they sow a little pease the second crop after the
ground has been dunged for bear; and this gives them
an additional crop of oats, which is their great object.
It is very common here to mix about a fourth or fifth
part of rye with the oats, the first or second crop after
bear; and this they account a very profitable method,
