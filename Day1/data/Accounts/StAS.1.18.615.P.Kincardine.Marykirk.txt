quently to the patronage, which was sold by the incumbent
to his Lordship, not long before his death.

   Glebe.-The glebe consists of a little more than 4 acres, at
a considerable distance from the manse.  The stipend of Mary-
kirk from 1650, to 1794, was annually 4 chalders of victual,
and L. 29: 3: 4 sterling in money.  As the masters of King's
College, Old Aberdeen, claim the teinds of the parish, a
process of augmentation was commenced against them, in
the Court of Teinds, in 1788, which they defended with
great obstinacy, until 1794, when the minister obtained from
the Lords of Council and Session, the Commissioners of
Teinds, a decreet of modification and locality, for an aug-
mentation to his stipend, of 3 chalders of victual, 1/3 bear, 2/3
meal, and L. 10 Scots, for Communion elements.  But this
augmentation, moderate indeed as it is, his opponents seem
to quarrel with; and threaten an appeal to the House of Peers.
They draw from this parish, by their conversion of victual,
from the heritors, upwards of L. 173 sterling, which is
more than twice the minister's old and new stipend put toge-
ther.

   School.-About 7 years ago, there was a new school and
school-house erected by the heritors; the old school being
ruinous and ill-placed, above the arch of the tomb of John-
ston.  The schoolmaster's salary is L. 10: 10 sterling, and
L. 2: 8 as clerk to the Kirk Session, and Caldham's fund, etc.
His other perquisites as schoolmaster are very inconsiderable;
for proclamations, 2 s 6 d; baptisms, 10 d; teaching English
by the quarter, 1 s 6 d; Arithmetic, 2 s; Latin, 2 s 6 d.  In
summer there are but few scholars, in winter, the number
may be about 30.  Besides, there are 2 other schoolmasters
in the parish, who teach Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic;
