     NUMBER XXIX.

     PARISH OF BEATH.

     (County of Fife.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES REID.

     Extent, etc.

   BEATH is a small inland parish, about four English miles
long, and three broad, situated on the west end of the
county and synod of Fife, and presbytery of Dunfermline.
The Earl of Moray is patron.  The value of the living is
about L. 80 Sterling, including the glebe.

   Productions.-The only crops it produces are oats, barley,
pease, beans, potatoes, and turnips; but no wheat, except what
the minister sows in his glebe.  It is believed, however, that
a great deal of wheat might be raised, were the ground pro-
perly prepared; but the farmers seem to have a prejudice
against it.  A great proportion of the land is in grass, and
produces excellent hay and pasture.  The largest of the cat-
tle bring about L. 10 or L. 12 a head.  Provisions of all kinds
have risen nearly one half within these 20 years, except oat
meal, which is the principal food of the common people.
There is only one coalliery in the parish at present, be-
longing to John Symes, Efq; of Cartmore; several other seams
of coal have been wrought formerly, and may still be wrought,
as most of the ground seems to contain that mineral.
