trout; the other 3, on the south end, near Loch Ken, stored
with pike.  Loch Ken is 5 miles long, and from 1/2 to 3/4 of
a mile broad.  Loch Ken and Loch Dee are but one loch, con-
tinued 10 miles long.  They abound with pike, trout, perch,
ell, and salmon.  The pike grow to a very large size.  The
head of one, caught with the rod, is preserved at Kenmore
Castle, which weighed 57 lb.  Some are frequently caught
from 20 lb. to 30 lb.; trout and perch, from 1 lb. to 6 lb.;
and several trouts have been taken, weighing 6 lb.  They
are in the greatest perfection in May, June, and July.  Few
are exposed to sale.  Loch Ken and Loch Dee are navi-
gable.  Boats of considerable burden are frequently em-
ployed in bringing up marl from the Carling work Loch,
and carrying down fir, ash, and oak-wood, with which
this billy country abounds.  There is a salmon-fishing on
the Dee.  At its first erection, about 30 years ago, it was
let at about L. 10.  It has never been very productive.
There is another fishing in this parish, claimed as no man's
property, that cannot be easily estimated.  I mean a pearl
fishery.  In dry summers, great number of pearls are
fished here; some of great size, and fine water, and are
sold from 1 s. to L. 1, 1 s. according to their size and
beauty.

   Hills.-There is on the south end of this parish, a range
of high hills, lying from N. W. to S. E. 5 miles in length
and upwards of 3 miles over, of one continued solid mass
of granite, almost naked, only here and there some spots
of heath.  The sloping sides of these hills and the flats 
near them, for a mile S. W. are covered with large masses
of loose rock, all granite; so thick, that you may almost
walk over them; and so big, that many of them are 10
tons weight.  These are not broken pieces of rock, fallen
from the hils, for the hills are entire; and if they were,
could never have come to their present situation.  The
