   Antiquities and Traditions.-I shall for the sake of pre-
servation give all the traditions that I have learned, how-
ever unimportant some of them may appear.  I have alrea-
dy mentioned the Forest, and the Castle of Hall Forest,
which has been very ancient.  A part of this forest with
the castle, was given by King Robert Bruce to Robert de
Keith, Great Marischal of Scotland, after the battle of
Bannockburn, and it remains in the hands of his descen-

of Kintore.  It may be conjectured, that a part of what
was given to the Marischal, was bounded by the Sheriff-
burn, which separated it from the rest of the shire; for,
when it passes on from what had been the old march to the
freedom of Kintore, it loses tht name, and becomes the
Coney-burn and the burn of Tuach.  There are the re-

There is a tradition of a battle having been near Cam-
miestane, where a general or chief, of the name of Camus
or Cambus, was slain, and is buried.  There is on the side
of the highway, between Kintore and Inverury, a long,

purpose, about the time of the battle of Inverury, or his
engagement with the Cummines in this neighbourhood.
Upon the head of the hill of Creechy, it is said, the Earl
of Huntly pitched his camp, when marching southward be-
fore the battle of Correechie; and that having been warned
