or other; but whether it adorned the helmet, the breast-plate, or
the sword handle, antiquaries have not yet fully agreed.
  Modern Buildings.-There is little to be noticed in this re-
spect. Birkhill, the seat of Henry S. Wedderburn of Wed-
derburn and Birkbill, is a very elegant and commodious mansion,
beautifully situated amongst extensive plantations, on the banks
of the Tay. Naughton House was erected in the end of the last
century, and has since received many alterations and improve-
ments. The church and manse were built,-the first in 1811 and
the other in 1816; the former is rather small for the increasing
wants of the parish; the latter, with an excellent set of offices, is
suitable and commodious. They are all built of stone found in
the parish.
			Ill.-POPULATION.
  The population of the parish has been steadily on the increase
for many years past, owing to feuing, and to its vicinity to Dun-
dee, where employment can easily be procured in the manufac-
turing of linen, &c.

  The number of endividuals employed in weaving is about 150.
The rest are chiefly engaged in agriculture. There are in the
parish 5 grocers, 3 wrigbts, 4 shoemakers, 3 blacksmiths, 3 tailors,
1 medical practitioner, and 5 publicans.
  Character of the People.-The inhabitants are justly entitled to
be regarded as honest, industrious, sober, and extremely exam-
plary in their attendance upon the ordinances of religion. They
are strongly attached to the Established Church, and less than or
dinarily given to the following of divisive courses.
