   Dirlet Castle.-The next piece of antiquity worthy of
notice is Dirlet Castle.  It stands in a very beautiful ro-
mantic place in the Highlands, called Dirlet, on a round
high rock, very steep, almost perpendicular on all sides.
The rock and castle hang over a very deep dark pool, in
the river Thurso, which runs close by its side.  On each
side of the river and the castle, and very near them, are
two other rocks much higher, looking down over the castle,
with a stately and lowring majesty, and fencing it on these
sides.  By appearance, as well as by accounts, it was a
place of strength in the days of rapine and plunder.  For
further security it had the river on one hand, and a ditch
on the other, through which the water was conveyed, with
a draw-bridge.  The last inhabitant was a descendent of
the noble family of Sutherland.  He was called in Erse
the Ruder Derg, that is, the Red Knight.  Having been
denounced a rebel for his oppressive and violent practices,
he was apprehended by Mackay of Farr, his own uncle,
and died on his way to Edinburgh, some say to Stirling, to
be tried for his life.  Mackay took possession of his estate,
which consisted of the lands called the Tenpenny land of
Braygald, a very fine and lucrative estate, and his successors
enjoyed it for a considerable time.  Whether Mackay got
these lands as a reward for his loyalty, and the services he
did his King and country by this action, or by what other
means, I cannot say.  Neither can I say at what period of
time this Ruder Derg lived.  His name and title, by all
accounts, was Sir William Sutherland of Braygald, that is,
of the Height of Caithness.  This estate has been for many
years in the possession of the family of Ulbster, who acqui-
red it from the Mackays.
   Lochmore Castle.-The next in course is Lochmore castle,
about 8 miles above Dirlet.  It stood just on the bank of
