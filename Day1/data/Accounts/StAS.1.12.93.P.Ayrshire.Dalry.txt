     Of Dalry.

only preserved every man's property entire, but was useful
to the ground itself, by keeping it from being potched in win-
ter and spring; the enclosures keeping the ground warmer,
and affording shelter to their cattle, both in the heat of sum-
mer, and from the cold in winter.  Sensible of these, and
other advantages, enclosing went rapidly on, either at the ex-
pense of the proprietor, or of his tenants.  And so eager
have tenants been, for a long while past, about it, that they
have not only their grounds in general enclosed, but properly
subdivided, and scruple not to pay the interest of the money,
the proprietor of the lands lays out in such enclosings, even
to 5, and sometimes to 7 1/2 per cent., according to the different
fences made.  In the low part of the parish, the enclosures
are mostly ditches of different wideness, and rows of thorns
sometimes mixed with some ash or beeches, which, when they
thrive, give good shelter to the ground.  The moor farms of
the parish, are all enclosed with stone fences of different heights.
The farms, in general, are not large in the low part of the
parish.  They seldom exceed 60 L. in rent, and many let at 20 L.
10 L., and some even lower.  The moor farms being more ex-
tensive, let from 100 L. to 200 L., and even more.  The grounds
in the low part of the parish, and that lie along the waters,
are never rented below 1 L., and some such, are also rented at
1 L. 10 s. the acre, and sometimes above that.  The grounds
adjoining to these, and of a different quality, are, in general,
rented from 12 s. to 15 s. the acre.  The moor farm, where
there is tolerable good grass, and no heath, about 7 s. 6 d. the
acre.  The heath pasture is not generally let by the acre, but
by the lump.  The valued rent of the parish is 6538 L. 14 s.
Scots; the real rent about 6350 L. Sterling.  The number of
heritors may be about 90.  Only one considerable landholder
resides, and who possesses, I suppose, not much less than one-
