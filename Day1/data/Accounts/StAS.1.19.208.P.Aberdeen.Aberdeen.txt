there were not above 1500 stones of wool manufactured in
a year.  But there has been manufactured,

   About half of the above wool comes from Northumber-
land, a small part from London, and the rest is Scotch.
   The decrease of the manufacturing of backings is owing
to the stocking-manufacturers of Aberdeen (from whom
they were got) doing very little business since the French
over-ran Holland, which was the principal market for the
woollen stockings.
   The country people, 10 miles round Aberdeen, manu-
facture about 900 stone a-year of Scotch wool, mostly for
their own use.
   Cloths manufactured from the above wool are six quar-
ters broad duffles; six quarter broad blue milled cloths, at
from 4 s. to 10 s. per yard; three quarters to yard broad
seys, sarges, shafts, plaidings, baizes, linseywoolseys, jem-
mies, and stripped apron stuffs.  The colours are chiefly
dark and light blues, with a few mixtures and drabs.
   The above cloths are fold along the east coast of Scot-
land, betwixt Perth and Tain, and 20 miles up the country.
A few of the broad cloths are sent to London and Ame-
rica.
   The only inconvenience that the woollen-manufacturers
in Aberdeen labour under is the want of weavers, particu-
larly for broad cloths, which indeed is the only bar why
they do not extend their manufacture of cloths, of the
quality of the Yorkshire broads and Rachdale baizes, for
exportation.
