     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF DREGHORN.

     (COUNTY OF AYR.)

     By the Rev. Mr MICHAEL TOD.

     Situation, Surface, Soil, etc.

   THE parish of Dreghorn, or rather the united parishes
of Dreghorn and Percietown, are situated in the pref
bytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  These
parishes were united in the year 1668.  Each of them had
a glebe;  but the minister possesses only the glebe of Dreg-
horn.  These parishes may be 9 English miles in length,
and at the broadest part of them 3 in breadth, though, in
some parts they are not one.  They are bounded on the
W. N. W. and N. by the water of Annock, which sepa-
rates them from the parishes of Irvine and Stewartown;
and the water of Irvine separates them from Dundonald on
the S.  They are bounded by Kilmares on the S. E. and on
the N.E. by Fenwick.  The ground is a gradual ascent
from the west end of the parish to the east.  The soil in that
part of it, which lies nearest to the sea, is either sandy or
gravelish.  Above the village it is a fine loam. and the rest
of it clay.  The whole of the parish is arable, except a few
acres of marshy ground, which are used as meadow lands.
