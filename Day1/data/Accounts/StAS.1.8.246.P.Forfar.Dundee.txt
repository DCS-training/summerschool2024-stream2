     Statistical Account

   One disadvantages of Dundee arises from its situation, and
hardly admits of a proper remedy.  It is the distance at which
it is placed from any large fresh water river, with falls suf-

to manufactures.  The nearest falls of this description are
on Dighty, and in the parish of Monyfieth; but they are
too distant for deriving full advantage from the population
of Dundee.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In the year 1782, the corns
were much damaged by excessive rains, the harvest was not
completed till towards the end of November, and a consider-

this occasion, their usual generosity; and at one time, with a
view of alleviating the distress of the poor, the rum of 200 L.

they who had no need, were partakers equally with the poor;
and the consequence was, that they who had grain to sell, car-
ried it to other markets, which were free from such timid and
impertinent regulations, and where they received their prices
immediately from the buyers, without having the trouble of
applying, for any part of them, to trustees of public money.
Accordingly, the supply of the Dundee market, as might have
been easily foreseen, was, through the whole season, scantry
and difficult; and depended entirely on the influence the
magistrates could exert with country gentlemen, and the more
opulent class of farmers.  Even the supply of many families,
who were not under the necessity of going daily to marker,
became a business of constant and vexatious solicitation.  The
