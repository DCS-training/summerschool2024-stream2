numerous, living in one of these old cottages. One small apart-
ment must serve for all purposes. It is most distressing to wit-
iness one of these families when fevers and other contagious dis-
eases visit them. And not only is the accommodation wretched,
but an exorbitant rent is frequently demanded, more especially
when a family has a cow grazed,--an object about which families
with young children are  solicitous. The tenants allege, that the
landlords rack them, and that they are under the necessity of act-
ing the same part to their dependents. There are many liberal
minded landlords in the country, who wish not to see either tenants
or cottagers oppressed. And it would be well for the latter, were
they to take them entirely under their own management and pro-

grants to America. It is well known, that the United States and
the North American British Colonies are the quarters to which
the eyes of thousands, who find they cannot thrive in their own
country, are anxiously directed. And of these a considerable pro-
portion are guilty of dishonest practices. During the ministry of
the present incumbent, not much short of a score have left this
parish under charges of various kinds; some to avoid supporting il-
legitimate children,--some, after swindling practices and commit-
ting forgery,--and some after committing frauds of all sorts, with a
view to emigrate with their ill gotten agains. The state of our
North American Colonies is such, that it may be said to hold out
a premium to the practice of villany in the other country. This
is a subject well deserving the attention of our landed proprietors
and legislators.
