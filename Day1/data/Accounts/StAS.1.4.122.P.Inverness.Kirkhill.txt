meal, so as to afford them a scanty subsistence in winter.
But the third crop failing, they could subsist no longer:  Ac-
cordingly, they deserted their habitations in one body, and
came down to the plain below, where they set up a lamen-
table howling; and having wept till they had no further
power, they dispersed themselves to beg or serve, as they
should find a reception, the wise separating from the hus-
band, the mother from the children.
   A disadvantage much felt in this parish, is the scarcity of
fuel.  The common tenants and cottagers depend chiefly
on turf, the peat mosses being almost exhaused.  The pro-
prietors and better tenants burn coals from Sunderland or
Newcastle; but the high price, owing to the duty on this
article, puts them beyong the reach of the poor.  Many dis-
advantages arise from the late distillery-law.  The con-
sumpt of barley makes the price of grain very high for
the poor, confining the fale of the spirits distilled to a
particular district, while every parish within that district
has the same privilege of distilling, is in fact confining
what is distilled within the parish to the consumpt of
that parish, if such a limitation destroys the benefit of any
manufacture in a great measure, much more so of this.  The
abundance of spirits without a market has lowered the price.
So that they sell sometimes at 9 s. the Scots gallon; an Eng-
lish pint may be had at 4 d. in the alehouse.  This is too
strong a temptation for persons having the smallest inclina-
tion to drink.  Hence, too, alehouses or dram-houses, as
they ought be called, are multiplied; and each of these
may be considered as seminaries of vice and idleness.
About two years ago, there were 8 alehouses within this
parish; but the Justices of the Peace, conscious of their hurt-
ful tendency, shut them all up, except two, that are at con-
venient distances upon the public road.
