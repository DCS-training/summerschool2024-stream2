cypress, the yew, the arbor-vitae of both east and west, the hem-
lock-spruce; not to speak of a considerable variety of smaller and
shrubby evergreens exotics, now in course of planting.
  The extent of ground covered with wood, whether planted or
natural, is very considerable; probably not less than 8 square
miles, or about 5000 acres. And the susceptibility of the soil
for the growth of timber, as well as the favourable character of
the climate, may be clearly seen from an examination of the sub-
joined table. It is the result of measurements made by the writer
of this article at a few "idle hours," which, it is to be hoped, will
not be said to have been altogether idly spent. The specimens
selected are all within a circle round the Castle of Taymouth, of a
radius little more than two miles, in latitude 56&deg; 38, and growimg
at an elevation above the level of the sea, ranging from about 360
to about 700 feet; and some of the very largest trees, particular-
ly the larches, oaks, and Scotch firs, are at the latter height. The
measurement was taken, in each individual, at two feet; above the
surface of the ground.

  If one desires to see specimens of the massy growth of some of
these giants of the forest, let me recommend to him to look at the
ash behind the Inn of Kenmore; the beech at the saw-mill; the
four Spanish chestnuts at the foot of the bank in front of the fort;
the elm to the south of Lady Breadalbane's garden; the lime
early in front of the castle; and the larch beside the Rock-lodge
  It is worthy of observation that many of the trees comprehended
