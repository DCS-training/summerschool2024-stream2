hay the first year of the grass, some are beginning to pasture
that year, and to cut for hay the second.  This, they think
gives them hay of a superior quality, and rye-grass seed in the
greatest perfection.  A few never make any hay for sale; but
pasture all the years.  Instead of taking only 1 crop of corn
after the ley, some take 2.  The whole dung of the farm is
laid on with the rurnip or potatoes; and when it is not suf-
ficient for all the ground allotted for green crop, they fallow,
and sometimes dung and sow wheat in October.  At pre-
sent, however, wheat is not a common crop here; the far-
mers finding that barley is, in general, more profitable, es-
pecially when the value of the turnip is considered.  Ano-
ther rotation much approved of, when dung can be command-
ed, is, 1st, oats after ley; 2d, turnip or potatoes; 3rd, bar-
ley with grass-seeds; 4th, hay, or the grass cut green; 5th,
pasture; 6th, oats, or flax, etc. as before.  Here likewise the
dung is laid on with the turnip, etc, which are always horse-
hoed.  Another mode of culture practiced here, deserves to
be mentioned.  Mr. Kinloch of Kilroe, having the command
of the river Gairie, begins, in the month of November, to
flood his enclosures at Logie, and continues to do so at inter-
vals, till the middle of April.  These enclosures have been in
grass since the year 1770; and, in consequence of the above
practice, are now the earliest aud best grass fields in the coun-
ty; and there is not, perhaps in Scotland, any superior to
them.  Before the above period, they let at from 10 s. to 12 s.
an acre.  Last season, 1792, from 3 L. to 4 L. 10 s. Sterling the
acre+.
   Neither oats nor barley are raised in sufficient quantities to
supply the consumption of the parish; but black cattle, lean
