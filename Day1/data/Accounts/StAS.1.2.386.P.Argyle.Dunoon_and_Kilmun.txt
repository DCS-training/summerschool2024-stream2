Dunoon.  But were more acres and roods of land let out, more
inhabitants would probably gather to it, and it might become the
seat of some useful manufacture.  The people, that are year-
ly removing to Greenock, would here find, at the rent they
pay, for a small and confined lodging in that town, the grazing
of a cow, with a little ground for sowing grain, and room for
planting a few potatoes, with a garden to afford them vegetables,
a hut to live in, and nearly as good access to fishing as any where.

   Fishing.-Within the Firth of Clyde, particularly upon the
shore of Dunoon, fish, more especially what are called, ground
fish, do not seem to be in abundance, excepting when herrings
frequent the lochs.  Other fish seem then in greater plenty to at-
tend them; though even then, they do not seem so abundant
as, in general, to encourage the north country fishers, who have
frequented our shores for some years past, to lay their long lines
within the firth.  But in the more open sea, at the mouth of 
Lochsine, about 20 or 30 miles hence, or upon the coast of
Bute and Arran, about the same distance, fish of the best kinds
are to be got.  The villagers of Dunoon, also, find a coarse fish,
called Seath, which may be caught with rods and short lines,
all the summer over, when the weather is good, at rocks a-
bout a cannon-snot, at sea, off the castle of Dunoon.  But our
people are far from being so skillful and industrious, as the
north country fishers, who have come annually for sometime
past, and in greater numbers from year to year; but have as
yet got no fixed residence on this coast.  They were, at first,
brought to fish salmon in the bays, and that still seems to be their
principal object; but, when the season for fishing salmon,
which continues only for about 3 months in summer, is over,
if herrings have not become an object to them, they betake
themselves to the fishing of ground-fish, and carry them from
the distance of, from 30, 40, or perhaps 50 miles, to Glas-
