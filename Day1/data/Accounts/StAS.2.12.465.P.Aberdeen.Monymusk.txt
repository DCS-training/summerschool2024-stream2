the house, mostly by the old masters, some of which are of con-
siderable value.
   There is a distillery in the parish; and a very considerable ma-
nufactory of wood is carried on, there being two saw-mills and
seven pair of sawyers in pretty constant employment.  The timber
manufactured within the parish, is cut in the woods both of Mony-
musk and of the adjoining property of Tillyfour, belonging to the
same family, in the parish of Oyne; and, after being sawn into
planks and deals, is carried to market in districts of the country
where that commodity is scarce.

                       III.-POPULATION.
  The population of the parish cannot be traced, with any great
degree of accuracy, farther back than the date of the last Statis-
tical Account.  From a comparison, however, of the yearly num-
ber of baptisms recorded in the oldest register, with the number
of births at present, the population would appear to have been ful-
ly greater a hundred and fifty years ago than it is now,
   The excess of the population in 1831 above that in 1821 is to
be attributed chiefly to the settlement, in several parts of the pa-
rish, of younger persons who are rearing families.

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is                       50
                   of deaths, as nearly as can be ascertained, about           12
                   of marriages,                                                6

                                      30 and 50,                              216

There are 2 insane persons, both young men, belonging to the
parish, who have been in the Lunatic Asylum at Aberdeen for se-
veral years without any prospect of recovery.
   Popular Customs.-There are no popular customs or amuse-
ments peculiar to this parish at present.  Formerly, the foot-ball,
now the amusement chiefly of school-boys only, as in other places,
was a favourite exercise with persons of almost all ages in the pa-
rish, in which parties from other parishes, occasionally joined to
contend for the palm of victory : and " The Monymusk Christmas
Ba'ing," with its various casualties, has been celebrated in a hu-
morous poem by the late Rev. John Skinner, grandfather of the
   ABERDEEN.                         G g
