remarkable for its vast numbers of charr, a species of fish rare
in Scotland: and Loch-Whinnyan, abounding with trouts.
This lake, it deserves notice, furnishes the cotton mills at
Gatehouse with a copious stream of water; the course for
conveying which from the lake, was cut a long way through
a hill, at the expence of above 1200 L.

   Proprietor, Mansion-House, &c.-The whole parish is the
property of James Murray, Esq. of Broughton, whose man-
sion-house, Cally, stands about an English mile below Gate-
house, at a small distance from the borders of the Fleet.  The
situation is extremely pleasant.  The house is modern, and
amongst the largest, and most princely, in the south of Scot-
land.  The place is laid out on an extensive scale.  About
1000 acres are in planting, gardens, orchards, and pleasure-
grounds.  The gardens were made at a great expence, and

equal to any in the hot-houses of this country.  There is also
a deer park, well stocked; the venison of which is reckoned

   Rent, Leases, Servitudes, etc.-The total valuation of the
parish, in the cess-book, is 3281 L. 3 s. 6 d. Scotch, or 273 L. 8 s.
7 1/2 d. Sterling.  The present rent is about 3500 l., including a
moderate average rent for the lands not in lease.  The leases
are generally given for 19 years.  The greater part of the
moor lands are let by the lump: The low lands bring about
10 s. per acre: The fields, near Gatehouse, from 1 L. to 2 L.
The oppressive practice of thirlage prevails, and hurts their
lands.  The barony of Castramont is thirled to the mill of
Kelleren, in the parish of Anwoth; and the barony of Cally
to the mill of Burby, in this parish.  The proprietor has con-
