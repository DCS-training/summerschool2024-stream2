from the Almond, and which brings down a large propor-
tion of that small river to Perth.
   The stone barrier at the head of the canal, which divides
the water of the Almond, was most probably an invention
and work of the Romans.  The name which it bears, is
Louis-wark; which, according to Shaw's Gaelic Dictionary,
means water-work.
   There are some documents of this canal having been in ex-
istence before the time of Malcom Canmore; who, after the
death of Macbeath, ascended the throne in 1057.  Without
it, there could have been no supply of water for the mills
which were then at Perth.  It still supplies the mills, and
now also the wells with water, and formerly filled the ditches
when the town was fortified.
   The Inches are used partly for pasturing cattle belonging to
the inhabitants, and partly for walking and other recreations.
Also, as in the Campus Martius, military men perform their
exercise there.  Both the Inches are furnished with benches,
and the south Inch is surrounded by an avenue of trees of dif-
ferent kinds.  A poet, or a painter, might find full scope in
either of those Inches, to indulge his particular genius.
   To the west the prospect is bounded, at about a mile's
distance, by what is called the Moor.  That part of it which
belongs to Perth, contains a stone quarry, and is covered
with an extensive wood, which is of great value to the public
revenue of the town.
   The tide, from the German ocean, flows up the river by
the south side of the Carfe of Gowrie, and reaches, though
not so full, about two miles above Perth.  The spring or
high tides bring ships, considerably above 100 tons burthen,
close to the shores of the town.

roads or military streets in this part of the country, describes
