   Air, Climate.-The air here is tolerably dry, mild and
temperate, and the climate salubrious.  Though the ground
is very flat and level, yet there are no stationary diseases oc-
casioned by noxious vapours, arising from stagnated waters.
We have no lakes; no mosses; or if in former times there
have been any, they are now all drained and exhausted.  In
almost every part of the parish there are rivers, rivulets, and
brooks to carry off the rains that ly upon the ground, together
with the waters emitted from the springs.  The high moun-
tains at a distance, and the lower hills that bound us on the
northeast, attract the clouds above, before and behind us.
Did the rains that fall upon them, descend so frequently upon
our hollow grounds, they would render our lives comfortless,
and our fields pools of water.  We sometimes in what we
think dry weather, envy our neighbours that live nearest the
hills, for the seasonable and refreshing showers we see them
receive: but, perhaps, had we more discernment, we would
greatly rejoice that they have not yet come to us, as our
ground is not fit to receive them.  When epidemic distem-
pers invade any of the neighbouring parishes, and now and
then cut off several of the inhabitants, they seldom penetrate
our boundary; or if they do, their attacks are less violent and
destructive.  In short, the climate here is so good, that in
some years, there have not been above 7 or 8 persons buried
in this church-yard; and most of there old people, worn out
by age and infirmities.  Inoculation does not universally pre-
vail, though several attempts have been made to render it
general; yet very few children die of the small-pox.  Though
there are not many instances of great longevity; yet there are
several persons now alive, above 80.  About 3 years ago, a
