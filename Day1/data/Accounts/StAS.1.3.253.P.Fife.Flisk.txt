   Productions.-The farmers sow a good deal of wheat.
About 12 or 15 years ago, there was very little wheat sown;
but now they sow, one year with another, 150 bolls, in the
extent of one or two and twenty ploughs of land.  As the
barony lands in this parish are upon the Tay, the farmers
have their barley, which is esteemed very good, shipped off
in cargoes to other places; but, before the demand from the
distilleries, etc. they often found it difficult to procure a mar-
ket for their grain.  They have now got threshing-mills in-
troduced, which will forward their operations not a little.

   Hills.-There is a very large hill, called Norman's Law,
which rises from the level of the Tay, upon two eminences,
one above another.  From this hill there is a most extensive
prospect.  The common opinion, as to the origin of the 
name Norman, is, that the Norwegians, in their piratical in-
cursions, did, for some time, encamp upon this hill.  This
tradition account is favoured by the appearance of an in-
trenchment round the summit.

   Sheep.-There is not a sheep in this parish, nor indeed,
from the present mode of farming, can sheep be kept, unless
the low lands, as well as the hilly grounds, of which there
is a vast extent, were inclosed.
