     of Liff and Bervie

in consequence of the improvements made by his extended 
pleasure-ground,and the exambion of glebe and other lands,
little now remains of the former appearance and condition 
of this spot.  The village of Bervie, distant about a mile from
that of Liff, has also in former times been more considerable.
At present, it seems to labour under peculiar disadvanta-
ges, and must in a short time be entirely deserted, unless
these shall be removed.  But though population may have
declined in the west, it has of late years increased be-
yond the ordinary proportion in other quarters of this dis-
trict, particularly in the east, at Locheye and Milehouse.
This will appear from comparing the number of exami-
nable persons in the years 1753 and 1792.  By a survey
of the inhabitants in January 1792, the number of exami-
nable persons, or of those above 10 years old, amounted
to

This unusual increase has arisen from some conside-
rable seus granted out of the estate here, belonging to the
family of Lundie, between the years 1735 and 1740,
which proving convenient for manufactures, has been sub-
sued since that time, and is now remarkably filled with
