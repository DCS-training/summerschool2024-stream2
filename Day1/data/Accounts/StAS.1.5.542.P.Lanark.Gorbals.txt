made at the church door.  There are also five society boxes
amongst the different trades, which may give their poor a-
bout L. 100 a-year.  The people in general are very cha-
ritable, and the parish would maintain their own poor, and
prevent begging, were it not some of the poor people who
lodge for a penny a-night, wandering beggars, who hang
about the avenues to the city, and give out that they live
in the Gorbals.

   Population.-The village, it is said, about the beginning
of this century, consisted only of a few thatched houses on
each side of the great road from the south end of the old
bridge.  These were mostly possessed by maltmen, who
made malt and brewed ale.  In the year 1730 it was much
increased, the intermediate spaces  betwixt the old houses
being filled up with houses occupied by weavers.  In the
1732, the present church was built, as a Chapel of Ease to
Govan.  In the year 1748, the greatest part of the village
was burnt, after which it rapidly increased.  The houses
built were good, some of them consisting of 2, and others
of 3 stories and garrets.  In 1771, the village was compu-
ted to contain 3000 persons, besides 500 more connected
quoad sacra.  The village at present consists of upwards
of 5000 souls, besides about 800 who are joined quoad
sacra.  Within three years, it is expected, the number
will be doubled, and in 20 years, a new Clyde.  It is
impossible to ascertain either the births or burials
precisely, as the inhabitants of Glasgow both baptise
and bury in the Gorbals, and those of Gorbals in the city.
There are at least above 200 baptisms in the year.  The
people are industrious; there are several reputable manufac-
turers, and many good operative weavers; there are 556
looms, besides a number of gunsmiths, nailers, shoemakers,
