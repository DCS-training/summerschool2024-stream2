Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.  The first property of the
family was the barony of Methlick, whereof Haddo was a part.
His Lordship derives three of his titles from this parish, namely,
Baron Methlick, Haddo, and Kellie.
   Parochial Registers.-The oldest register of church discipline
and accounts of the poor's funds commences in 1683, and, with
the exception of the years from 1689 to 1703, and from 1726 to
1729, is complete till the present day.  The earliest date of the
baptismal record is 1663 ; but it has not been regularly kept,
owing to the neglect of parents in not attending to the registra-
tion of the births of their children.  The marriages have been
registered for many years.
   Modern Buildings.-Towards the end of the sixteenth century,
the designation of the family of Methlick seems to have been re-
stricted to that of Haddo, probably from the mansion-house having
been situated there.  Early in the seventeenth century, the resi-
dence was transferred to Kelly, which gradually acquired the name
that had been given to the former mansion, namely, the House
of Haddo, or Haddo House.  It stood a siege of three days in
1644, by the Marquis of Argyle and the covenanting army, by
whom it was taken on the 8th of May 1644, and reduced to ruins.
The writer of a View of the Diocese of Aberdeen in 1726 says,
" Here is now a castle begun in the last age by two of the lairds
of Haddo, but never finished, and in the low buildings hard by it,
their representative, the Earl of Aberdeen, lives."  The present
mansion was built mainly from the designs of John Baxter, Esq.,
architect in Edinburgh, who executed several buildings in the
north of Scotland in the beginning of the last century.  The Pal-
ladian was his favourite style, of which Haddo House is a speci-
men.  In its immediate vicinity are some old ashes and beautiful
limes, and a very picturesque larch, planted more than a hundred
years ago.
   Within the policies, there is an obelisk of granite erected by the
present Earl to the memory of his gallant brother, Sir Alexander
Gordon, who fell in the van at Waterloo, acting as aide de-camp
to the Duke of Wellington.
