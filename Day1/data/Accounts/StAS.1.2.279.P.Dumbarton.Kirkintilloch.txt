their own magistrates, independently of the lord of the baro-
ny.  The magistrates are two baillies; and are annually cho-
sen.  They are impowered by the charters of the burgh, to
hold courts, levy fines, imprison offenders, or even banish
them from their liberties; and in short, to exercise every right
with which the baron himself was vested, before the erection
of the burgh.  These rights, the community have continued,

its erection; and is now feued out, from time to time, in
moderate parcels, as purchasers offer,-Linens and cot-
tons, of different sorts, are manufactured here.-The wea-

tinguished public spirit, lately erected a small cotton-mill.
Hand-machines, for spinning cotton, were, at the same time,
introduced.  The undertaking is in a very thriving condition.
And, as the parish affords several other happy situations, it is
probable, that these may soon be occupied by more works of
the same kind.

   Highways, and the Canal.-One of the great roads between
Glasglow and Edinburgh, passes through the town of Kirkin-
tilloch; which is 7 miles distant from the former, and 49 from
the latter.-None of our rivers are navigable; but the great ca-
nal between the Forth and the Clyde, passes through the whole
length of this parish.  After having been frequently proposed,
since the Union, this canal was at lenght begun in 1768, and
