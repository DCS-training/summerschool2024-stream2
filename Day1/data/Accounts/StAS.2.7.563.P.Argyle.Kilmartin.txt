on a large scale; and for that purpose a tile-work has been erected
in the, valley of Kilmartin, where suitable clay is found in abun-
dance. Under the judicious management of Mr Gow, the super-
intendent of improvements on the Poltallocb estate, about 1500
acres have already been drained, 700 of which are now under
cultivation or pasture, and from 700 to 800 more prepared for the
plough, which, from total, or nearly total unproductiveness, is
made to yield an average yearly return of L.1, 5s. per acre. The
expense of these improvements may be rated at L.8 to L.9 per
acre. Two thousand acres more of the same description of waste
land yet remain to be reclaimed; but from the systematic and ex-
tensive operations carried on by the proprietor, the time may not
be very far distant when the whole of this magnificent flat will be
prepared for the plough, the sickle, and the scythe.
   Potatoes and turnips are extensively cultivated, for both of
which the soil and climate seem to be well adapted. Oats, bear,
and barley are also grown, but for these the climate is not so fa-
vourable.
   Live-Stock.--The common breed of cattle is the West High-
land, to which much attention is paid. The Ayrshire, Galloway,
and Durham breeds have been partially introduced, and seem to
thrive, when proper care is bestowed on them.
   The black-faced Highland sheep is common in the parish, and
is by much the most hardy breed for enduring the inclemencies
of the winter, and subsisting on the hill pasture. The Cheviot,
Leicester, and South Down breeds have been introduced, and
fatten kindly on good pasture. An Association for encouraging
the improvement of the different breeds of cattle and sheep, as
well as for agricultural and horticultural produce, is established in
the district, and has already been productive of much good.
