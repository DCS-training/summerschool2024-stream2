                        KILSYTH.                       153

   Landholders.-Sir Archibald Edmonstone of Duntreatb, Bart.
is by far the largest proprietor. His grandfather, Sir Archibald,
purchased the Kilsyth estate in 1784 from the York-Building
Company,-Campbell of Shawfield being the tacksman since the
forfeiture. He found it in a most neglected state. Few parishes
in Scotland have been more remarkably changed to the better, by
judicious and spirited improvement. Everywhere, it is now divided
with hedge-rows, and provided with excellent farm-steadings.
There is still apparent, after all that bas been done in the way
of plantation, a want of clothing ; but, in fact, the bills are
too valuable, as sweet pasturage for sheep, to be generally
planted.
