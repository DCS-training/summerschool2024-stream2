the start of their neighbors, whose limits and climate
would be much more favourable.  When they cut down 
their corns, they set them up in single sheaves, which is
called gaiting; by this means, if any thing wet, may soon
dry.  They let them stand thus for some days, but al-
ways with attention to the state of the weather. If there 
is the appearnace of rain, they set all hands to work,
even at midnight, and put them up in what are called
Huts, built in the form of a rick of hay, and covered with
two of the largest and the wettest sheaves , called Hout-
ings.  They make their huts larger or smaller, accord-
ing as the sheaves are wet or dried.  They keep the dry-
ness they take, even in very bad weather, except the
houtings, which are necessarily exposed; and, if well
built, hardly any weather spoils them.  In this this state
they stand till the weather is good; and whenever a fa-
vourable opportunity offers, they are taken down, and 
exposed to the drought, if it be necessary:  what is dry is
taken in, and what is unfit for the barn or barn-yard
is hutted again.  It is only when they need much work
that there is any loss of corn; for the most part very
little.  Last season (1972), the advantage was great.
We had, generally, all in the barn or yard, when others,
who might, from more favourable circumstances, been
thought to have been far before us, had a great deal to
cut down, and the whole of their crops in the field for 
weeks after us.

   Plantations.-There are no woods in the parish.  In-
deed very little timber of any kind; some few trees
about several of the farm houses, and some young trees
about the 2 villeges, excepted.  All the timber that is
necessary for almost any purpose is brought at the dif-
