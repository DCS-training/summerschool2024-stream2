ster's list, 2295, besides the Fair Isle, which had about 200.
In 1770, the families, including Fair Isle, were 561; the in-
habitants, 2942.  In 1790, the families, including Fair Isle,
were 570; and the inhabitants 3327.  The number of fe-
males greatly exceeds the males, as the young men leave the
country in numbers every year; being commonly inclined
to a seafaring life, they resort to England and Holland,
but chiefly to London, where they serve on board the navy,
merchant ships, or Greenlanders.  The annual number of
marriages depends much on the seasons: In good years they
may amount to 30 or upwards; but when the crops fail, will
hardly come up to the half of that number.

   Church and Poor.-A handsome church, with a pavilion
roof, covered with Easdale slate, was built a few years ago at
Dunrossness.  There is another church for the districts of
Sandwick and Cunningsburgh, whether the minister goes to
officiate every third Sunday.  That church has a kirk-session
of its own, and ought to form a separate parochial charge, if
there were funds sufficient for the support of a minister.  The
united parishes altogether form what is termed a ministry; and
this ministry is 12 miles in length, and, in some places,6 miles
broad.  The stipend is 1000 merks Scotch (55 L 11 s 3 d.
Sterling), and 50 merks (2 L 15 s. 7 1/2 d.) for communion
elements.  The whole people are members of the established
Church.  The presbytery of Zetland is not subject to the ju-
risdiction of any provincial synod, but depends immediately
in the General Assembly.
   The poor are supported by weekly collections, and the
fines levied from delinquents; the distribution is made by
the kirk-sessions.  The number of poor was small, and some
little stock was happily accumulated previous to the year1762,
when a scene of misfortunes opened upon Zetland, which
