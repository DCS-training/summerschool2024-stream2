near 80 miles from Greenlaw.  The nearest coal and
lime are in Northumberland, about 20 miles distant. Yet,
notwithstanding all these disadvantages, not only the S.
part of the parish, where the soil is good, but also many
other parts, where it is of inferior quality, are, by being
well enclosed and well limed, made as fertile as it is pos-
sible to render places so unfavourably situated for im-
provement.

   Antiquities.-The ruins of two ancient religious houses
are still to be seen in this parish.  They belonged to the
priory of Kelso, when popery was established in this
country*.

   Hints for Improvements.-1. It has been already observ-
ed, that several of the hills, in the N. part of the parish,
are improved towards the bottom. No part of them, how-
ever, is enclosed.  This is a great loss to the farmers, as
they cannot, with all their care and attention, keep their
sheep from the turnips in winter, nor fown grass in the
spring.  A few enclosures, therefore, would be of great
benefit; and would amply compensate for such sums of
money as would be necessary for making them.

*About a mile N. from the town of Greenlaw, an old wall, or earthen
mound, with a ditch on one side, known by the name of Harrit's, or
Herrit's Dike, runs across the parish.  It cannot now be ascertained,
either what the height of the wall, or depth of the ditch originally was;
but neither of them seems to have been considerable.  By the enclosures,
which have been lately made in the country, the greatest part of this wall
has been destroyed.  About 60 years ago, it could have been traced 11
males eastward; and tradition says, it proceeded, in the same direction,
as far as Berwick.  It is supposed to have extended westward to a place
in the parish of Lagerwood, called Boon; a word, in the Celtic language,
signfying boundary or termination.  It is not known by whom, or at
what time this wall was built; nor for what purpose it was intended.
