	We have two grain mills, the one in the eastern the other in
the western division of the parish, each of which has a saw-mill
attached; another saw-mill has been erected lately on the lands of
Dalmore, about the centre of the parish. One of the grain mills
has also a thrashing-mill attached to it and driven by water-power.
There are, twelve other machines of the same kind, belonging to a
like number of farms, but driven by horse power.
        Manufacture.--At Coalha', on the estate of Drongan, there
has been, for a long period, a pottery of earthenware, black and
brown, adapted to domestic and dairy purposes, flower-pots, chim-
ney-cans. The ware, besides being used all over this county, is
in great demand throughout Dumfries-shire, and the two counties
of Galloway, though coming into competition in that quarter with
English manufacture, and under the disadvantage of a much more
expensive carriage. Very considerable quantities are sent to Ame-
rica, the Highlands, and even to Glasgow. Mr Boyle, the tacks-
man, is also an extensive tile-burner--has been the successful con-
petitor in this quarter, and gained the first prize at the last
Highland Society meeting at Perth. He does not carry on this
branch here, but has a work in the neighbouring parish of Coylton,
very conveniently situated for the western and middle quarter of
the parish.
