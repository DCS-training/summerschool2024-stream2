     Statistical Account

It may, in the opinion of some, be no small recommenda-
tion of the parish to furnish objects of amusement, as well
as of profit.  By repairing to the Bogie, which abounds
with trout, the angler may find entertainment at leisure
hours; and the spotsman, who delights in more active di-
version, can traverse hills and dales with his dog and his
gun in search of hares, plovers, ducks, rails, grouse, par-
tridges, snipes, etc. in their season.

vantageous, nor will the cultivation of green crops, in all probability,
become general, till winter herding be introduced.  The cattle and
sheep are of a small breed, and, when properly fed, bring good prices;
because they are reckoned sweet and well-flavoured.  The farm of Leith-
hall, where Colonel Hay resides, is superior to most.  It has a southerly
exposure, fertile soil, and is well sheltered.  It is equally adapted for
rearing cattle, and producing grain.  The plantations afford shelter in
winter, and the southern exposure raises early grass in spring; and in
summer the richness of its pasture can hardly be exceeded.
