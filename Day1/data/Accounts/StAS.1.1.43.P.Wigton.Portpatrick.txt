     Of Portpatrick.

   Irish Cattle.-But of all the articles of the commerce of
Portpatrick, the import of black cattle and horses from Ire-
land is by far the most interesting.  Formerly such a com-
merce was prohibited, for the purpose of encouraging our
own breed.  The free importation was first permitted by 5th
George III. cap. 10. 1. for seven years, and from thence to
the end of the then next session of Parliament.  It was af-
terwards continued by several temporary acts, and at last
made perpetual, by 16th George III. cap. 8.  From the first
removal of the prohibition, there was a small annual impor-
tation; but it was never carried on to any great extent till
1784, when it rose suddenly without any cause that has yet
been assigned for it.  In that year there were imported, be-
tween the 5th of January 1784, and the 5th of January
1785, no less than 18,301 black cattle, and 1233 horses.
The importation of cattle and horses, for the last five years,
ending the 10th of October 1790, has varied in the follow-
ing manner:

which, at an average, is about 11,000 head of cattle, and
2000 horses per annum.  Great as this importation has been,
it has not as yet materially hurt the sale, or diminished the
price of cattle, in the neighbourhood of Portpatrick.  On
the contrary, the demand for them has been rather on the in-
crease.  It is probable, however, that it would have been
greater, had there been no import.
