and Cleghorn; which last place may have been the Crou-
cindum of Baxter's Glossarium Antiquitat Brit. as not
only the Roman road passes by it, but the remains of
a Roman station are still evident in one of the parks to the
East of Cleghorn house.
   The station or camp at Cleghorn, General Roy thinks
was the work of Agricola. It measures 600 yards in
length by 420 in breadth, capable of containing two Ro-
man legions on the Polybran establishment, or 10,500
men; or it would hold one legion with its auxiliaries on a
much higher establishment.  Near the S. W. angle of
this camp, there is a small post or redoubt, that seems
either to have joined to the camp itself, or to have been
connected with it by means of a line.
   On the opposite side of the Mouss from Cleghorn, and
in Lanark-moor, was situated another small exploratory
camp of the Romans; and, within about a mile of it,
there is another of a later construction at Castle-dykes, in
the parish of Carstairs, through which runs the great
Roman road from Lugballum, or Carlisle, to the wall of
Antoninus.*  The Roman road from Castle-dykes runs
through part of Lanark-moor, thence passes the river
Mouss a little to the Eastward of Cleghorn-bridge, hence
it goes through tire inclosures of Cleghorn, leaving A-
gricola's camp on the right, and so on by Colly-law, Kill-

*General Roy tells us that near the kirk of Carstairs some remains of a bath
and other antiquities have been found; so that Carstairs may be the Corda of
Ptolemy; and the Castledykes the Cariotitar of the Geographer of Ravenna.
At the latter place Roman bricks and coins have frequently been dug up.
The late Sir George Lockhart was possessed of some of those coins, particu-
larly a beautiful, silver one of Nero's; and within these few years a consi-
derable number, mostly of Adrian, were discovered, the bulk of which
I believe are now with the Antiquarian Society.  One of them is in my
possesion.
