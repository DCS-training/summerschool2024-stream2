   NaturaI History.-The natural historian will find, in several
parts of this parish, objects meriting his attention.  In the
neighbourhood of Thornlie-bank, a small village, there is a
stratum of schislus, which has particularly attracted notice.
It is a good many yards in thickness, and contains a great va-
riety of marine productions, in a petrified state.  Specimens
of several genera of shells are found in fine preservation.
The orthoceratites both plane and sulcated, retain the origi-
nal shell; a circumstance which rarely occurs in natural his-
tory.  The specimens of shells, etc. are filled with iron stone,
containing a proportion of lime.  Many nodules of iron stone
of different shapes and dimensions, are imbedded in the stra-
tum of schiftus*.

   Manufacturers.-The manufactures carried on, are chiefly
the weaving of muslins, bleaching, printing of calicoes, and
cotton spinning.  In the weaving branches, there were em-
ployed, in 1793, about 470 looms: In printing, bleaching,
and the occupations connected with them, about 226 men
and boys, and 174 women.  There are also two cotton mills
in the parish, which at the same period, employed above
600 persons of different ages.  The principal print-field here
is among the oldest in Scotland.  The parish seems well
adapted to manufactures; and in general, the people are
more healthy than those usually are who follow such occu-
pations.  This may be owing in part, to the fresh currents
of air, which blow frequently with considerable strength be-
twixt the surrounding heights; and very much to the trades
man mingling sometimes with his sedentary employment, the
exhilarating and healthful exercises of the garden and the
field.
