  Wages.-Agricultural labourers receive from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a-
day; masons and carpenters and other mechanics, 14s. a-week.
  Live-stock.-The parish of Auchterarder, until of late, was very
deficient in stock of cattle, and indifferent to the breed reared in it.
A marked improvement in this respect is now visible.  Cows of
the Ayrshire breed fnr the dairy, and of the Teeswater for feed-
ing, are universally sought.  In the two hill farms which are in
the parish, the description of stock raised is reckoned of a supe-
rior kind.  In the lower part, some attention has been given to the
Leicester breed of sheep.
  Improvement of Land.-Draining has been carried to a great
extent.  Scarcely is there a field without its drain; and in most
places, draining might still be prosecuted with immense advantage
Captain Hunter may be mentioned as having by this means brought
many patches of useless morass into a state of profitable tillage,
or converted them into pleasure grounds.  Much waste land has
also recently been reclaimed, by embankments on the side of the
Earn.  These, however, are not always sufficient to guard off in-
undations.  It is said, that if a few cuts were made to render the
course of the river less tortuous, the destruction of fields and of
the labours of the husbandmen would often be averted.                                  The
farmers on the low lands complahn bitterly of the numerous dam-
dikes, which obstruct the natural course of the river.
  The farm-buildings, with few exceptions, are excellent, recent-
ly erected and commodious.  The enclosures are far from being
good; and in some parts, a fence of any description is never met
with to impdde the passage either of the wayfaring man, or the
wandering quadruped.
  An agricultural Association has existed in the parish for upwards
of twenty years.  It has an annual ploughing-match, when eight
premiums are awarded.   Considerable doubts are entertained con-
cerning the advantages of this Society, and it is not kept up with
very much spirit.
