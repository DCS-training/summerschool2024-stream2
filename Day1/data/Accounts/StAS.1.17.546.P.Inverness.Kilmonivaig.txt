   Antiquities-One of the greatest antiquities of this parish
is the old ruin of the Castle of Inverlochy.  There was, at
one time, a thriving borough, of the same name, adjacent to
this building, which some of the old Scotch historians call
the Emporium of the west of Scotland; but of this borough,
there are now no other vestiges, than some paved works in
different places, which were probably the streets of it.  The
castle has survived the burgh, and now stands alone in an-

formerly filled its ditches, run in another course, and outlived
all history, and all tradition, of its own builder and age.  It
is a quadrangular building, with round towers at the angles,
measuring 30 yards every way within the walls.  The towers
and ramparts are solidly built of stone and lime, 9 feet thick
at the bottom, and drawing in to the thickness of 8 feet
above.  As to the height of the towers, they are not so en-

as it is probable they were all on a level at top and standing
upon uneven ground; the western tower, which stood on the
lowest foundation, is the highest of them all, and the larger
every way.  It does not seem to have been less than 50 feet
when it was all entire; and the rest of the towers may pro-

to 30.  The inner area seems to have been uncovered; but
all the towers were, probably, roofed, by placing some cover
above a joisting of beams of wood, for which there are still
remaining some square openings in the walls at the top, as
