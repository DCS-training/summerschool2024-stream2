sobriety, and a decent and uniform attendance upon public
ordinances.  Those who adhere to the Established Church,
are steady in their attachment to her principles and govern-
ment, and are equally removed from a fiery bigotted zeal,
and from a lukewarm indifference about religion.

   Stipend, School, etc.-The Duke of Buccleugh is patron.
The stipend, including L. 100 Scots for communion-ele-
ments, is 48 bolls of victual, 2-3ds oat-meal, and 1-3d bear,
and L. 886: 13: 4 Scots.  The glebe consists of 4 Scots a-
cres, of the worst land in the neighbourhood, lies at an in-
convenient distance from the manse, and has always been
reckoned by the different incumbents to be incapable of
improvement, and scarcely worth the labouring.  It is
hoped, that the heritors will soon see the propriety of re-
moving this inconvenience, in return for the many fertile
fields thrown into their hands by the Presbyterians at the
Reformation, especially as the minister receives only L. 20
Scots for a grass glebe.-The schoolmaster's salary, and o-
ther emoluments, are about L. 20 yearly, besides the fees
of teaching in general near 80 scholars.  He has also a
commodious dwelling-house, and a tolerable garden.  The
stated school-fees are, the quarter, for English 1 s. 6 d.; for
writing 2 s.; for writing and arithmetic 2 s. 6 d.; and for
Latin 5 s.  For the accommodation of the highland part of
the parish, Mr Robert Mossat, portioner of Threepwood,
mortified, in the year 1759, the sum of 1000 merks Scots,
the interest of which is, in terms of the deed of mortifica-
cation, applied towards the maintenance of a schoolmaster
in that quarter.

   Poor.-The poor are supported by a voluntary assess-
ment of heritors, most of whom are feuars, and by the pu-
blic collections made at the church-doors upon Sundays.
