   Plantations.-Colonel Erskine of Carnock beautified his
estate of Tulliallan very much; for besides the large planta-
tions of firs which he made, and which have thriven so well
that many of them have been cut, there was not a kail-yard,
or any ditch by which water was conducted, but he planted.
He ornamented the roads, by planting, on each side, rows of
trees, consisting of oak, ash, beech, elm, plane, and hornbeam.
They have grown so well, that they are fit for ship building,
and other purposes.  The present Mr. Erskine of Cardross has
also planted many acres with fir, oak, and other barren wood,
which are thriving well.  He has now hardly any ground to
plant but what was lately cut.

   Antiquities.-There are no remarkable old buildings in the
parish, excepting the castle of Tulliallan, which formerly be-
longed to the Blackadders, who were knights baronets.  It
stands upon a small rising ground, about half a mile from the
Forth.  Nothing of it remains but the walls, and the arch over
the ground flat, which consists of three rooms.  Two of the
rooms have an octogan pillar standing in the middle, of about
5 feet 4 inches in circumference, supporting the arch.  It
appears to have been a place of strength, as it was surrounded
