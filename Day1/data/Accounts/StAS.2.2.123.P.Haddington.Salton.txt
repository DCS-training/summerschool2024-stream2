by the erection-at the entire expense of the late liberal patron,
General Fletcher,-of a handsome spire, springing from a low battle-
mented tower, and rising to the height (from the level of the ground)
of 90 feet. In its general appearance, our village sanctuary more
nearly resembles the sacred structures which so frequently adorn
the hamlets of England, than those less tasteful erections with
which the parsimony of heritors has too often disfigured, and not
embellished the parishes of Scotland. The number of sitters ac-
commodated in the church is about 400; it is, therefore, amply
sufficient for the present population. The manse was erected in
1805, and is, on the whole, in good repair. The extent of the
glebe is five acres Scottish, and is worth about L. 15 per annum.
The amount of the stipend is, in Linlithgow measure, 16 bolls
wheat, 120 do. meal, and 120 do. barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for com-
munion elements. For crop and year 1834, the only year of the
present minister's incumbency, the value of the stipend was, ex-
clusive of the sum allotted for communion elements, L. 246, 10s. *

<FOOTNOTE>In 1665, the stipend was L. 33, 2s. 6d. Sterling, together with 11 bolls, 2 pecks,
2 lippies of wheat: 11 bolls, 2 pecks, 2 lippies of bear: and 22 bolls, 1 firlot, I peck.
and 3 lippies of meal. In 1755, it amounted to L. 84, 1Os. 6d., and in 1798, to
L. 155, 3s. 8d. Sterling. In the ancient Taxatio the church of Salton was rated at
thirty merks.
   The following is a list of the incumbents of the parish of Salton, as far back as I
have been able to trace them.
   In 1488, when the church of Salton was attached to the Abbey of Dryburgh, the
incumbent appears to have been a person of the name of Dewar, who also held the of-
fice of dean, as he is termed, (Parl. Records, 343-53) "Dene Dewar." From this
period till the era of Presbytery, I have not been able to trace any of my clerical pre-
decessors. After the Reformation no stated minister appears to have been appointed
till about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Until that period, it would ap-
pear, from some incidental notices in the records of Presbytery, that the minister of
the adjoining parish of Pencaitland had some share in the pastoral superintendence
of Salton.  It is unquestionable that, in 1601, Salton was still without a regular mi-
nister, as in the instructions given by the presbytery to their commissioners to the
Assembly for that year, there is one obviously referring to "unplanted kirks," in these
words, "Saltoun kerk to be rememberit." It is probable that the first incumbent af-
ter the Reformation commenced his ministry about 1605 or 1606. From that pe-
riod the succession is regular.

he filled till his ordination.
