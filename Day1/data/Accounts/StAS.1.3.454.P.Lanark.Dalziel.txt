     NUMBER LXVI.

     PARISH OF DALZIEL.

     (County of Lanark.)

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT CLAWSON.

     Etymology of the Name.

   THIS parish is supposed, by some, to have got its name
from the ancestors of the Dalziels, Earls of Carnwath.
Others say the name is of Celtic origin, and signifies white
field in the Gaelic language, which they suppose it has ob-
tained from a kind of white vegetable scurf, which grows
over the clay soil, before it is sweetened by cultivation.  But
whether the parish has given the sirname to that family, or 
derived its name from them, it is certain that the barony was
vested in them by a charter from King Robert III. in the
year 1395.  It appears, by an old charter still extant, that it
had before been in the hands of a family of the name of 
Sandilands, in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, and had af-
terwards come to be in the gift of the Crown, whether from
failure of heirs, or forfeiture, is not known.  There is a tra-
dition, that at an early period, a baron of the name of Nisbit
also held some part of the parish.  The Dalziels retained
these lands till the year 1600, when they were sold to James
Hamilton, the brother of Sir John Hamilton of Orbiston,
who was Lord Justice Clerk in the reign of Charles I.; and
a descendant of that gentleman is the present proprietor.
