     NUMBER XXV.

     PARISH OF REDGORTON

     (COUNTY OF PERTH, PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD
     OF PERTH AND STIRLING.)

     By the Rev. MR DAVID MONCRIEFF.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE name of this parish is wrote differently Redgore-
town, contracted Redgorton, Rogertown, and Regorton.
The first seems to be the most ancient; and, according to
vulgar tradition, is derived from the battle of Loncarty, at
which time, many of the wounded were brought to the cu-
rate's house, which from thence was called Redgoretown, or
the town of the red-gore, and afterwards gave that name to
the whole parish.  Rogertown is derived probably from the
name of a family, Rogers, now entirely extinct; the name it-
self is now become obsolete.  The other name Regorton, is
Gaelic, and, as I am informed, signifies in that language
a field of corn.
