and nearly twice the distance.  From the spirited efforts,
however, which are now making for the better manage-
ment of these works, there is every reason to expect, that,
in future, the country will be better supplied.  Peats, with
which this parish is remarkably well supplied, form the
chief fuel of those of inferior rank.  They will, however,
be less used, and their value consequently decline, as coal
becomes more plentiful, and is more easily obtained; this
latter being esteemed not only a preferable, but upon the
whole, a cheaper fuel.

   Springs.-This parish is not only remarkably well wa-
tered by burns and rivulets, but also by a number of pure
springs of the finest qualities.  In particular, there is a
very remarkable one, about a quarter of a mile from the 
mansion-house of Springkell, which Mr Pennant in 1772
said was the largest spring he had ever seen, expecting the
famous spring at Holywell in Flintshire.  Of itself, with-
out any additional supply, it moves the mill of Kirkcon-
nell.  There are four mineral springs in this parish, of
which three are nearly of the same nature and qualities,
differing only in power*.

water, and which is most remarkable, situated in a most of very consi-
derable extent, and which as the well is many yards deep, which can-
not sail much to diminish the strength of its sulphureous quality, parti-
cularly in wet seasons.  Notwithstanding the disadvantage of situation,
it is found in a dry season, or in a very hard frost, to be stronger than
Moffat well.  A chymical analysis was some years ago made of it by a 
medical gentleman; the result of whole experiments tended to confirm,
