Men at 70 years of age attend.
   Sewing schools, and especially spinning schools, are much
required, as the women in general are very backward in
these respects*.

   Emigration.-Thirty-six men, women, and children, emi-
grated from Coll to America in 1792.  None hitherto has
emigrated from Tiry, though some talk of doing so.  Their
crops failed in 1790 and 1791, which, together with the
low prices of kelp and cattle, has much reduced them.  They
must soon go somewhere for relief, unless manufactures be
introduced to employ them.

   Ferries.-There is a stated ferry between Tiry and Coll,
often very dangerous, owing to a heavy swell from the At-
lantic, to rapid currents and amazing breakers, over rocks
and shifting sands.  There is a stated ferry between Coll and
Mull, 8 or 12 miles to the landing places.  It is dangerous,
on account of rapid currents at Loch-Iothurn and the point
of Caileach in Mull, and difficult of access to the harbours.
There is no stated ferry between Tiry and Mull.  The short-
est distance from land to land is 21 miles; but above 30 be-
tween the usual landing places.  The fare for a stout boat
and hands here, is from 12 s. to 15 s. For travelling cor-
respondence and markets, there is great need of a packet be-
tween these isles and Mull, especially if Tobermory, the
nearest post office town, increases.  It is to be hoped, when

*A few of the common people speak English.  They all
speak Gaelic, which has a greater similarity to the most ancient,
than to the modern languages.  And as it has little dependence
upon other languages, it may not be so copious; but it has this
great advantage, that the lowest peasant easily comprehends
the highest stile.
