     of Carmylie.

   Population.-The population of the parish, as returned to
Dr Webster about 40 years ago, was 730 souls.  It has since
rather decreased.  Some mechanics, especially weavers, have
removed to the trading boroughs of Dundee and Aberbrothock;
where they meet with good encouragement from the manu-
facturing companies in these towns.  Its inhabitants may now
amount to about 700.  The number of burials do not exceed
15 or 18 yearly.  The births are from 20 to 24 annually.
There are very few dissenters in the parish; not exceeding
20.  There is only 1 brewer; 4 persons retail ale.

   School.-There is a parochial schoolmaster here.  His sa-
lary is 100 merks Scots; a house, but no garden.  The per-
quisites belonging to him are very inconsiderable.  His whole
income does not exceed L. 20 Sterling.  He has about 50
scholars in winter, and 30 in summer.  Much praise is due
to the people for promoting and encouraging the education
of the youth of both sexes.  They have subscribed a certain
sum for building a school-house; and are determined to give
every support in their power to the person who is to have
the charge of instructing the girls in the different branches
of needlework.

   Birds, etc.-The dotterels, birds of passage, alight on the
rising grounds about the beginning of April, continue here
about three weeks, remove to the Grampian Hills, about 12
miles to the northward, and revisit this parish about the be-
ginning of August:  After abiding here about three weeks,
they fly off to the southward, and are not seen till the 1st of
April following.  There are quarries of grey flate and pave-
ment stones here, which have been wrought for some centu-
ries.  They supply the neighbourhood, and are exported to
Fife, Perthshire, the Mearns, etc.
