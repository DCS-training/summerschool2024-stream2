Garry, within the bounds of the parish, is L. 42.

   Minerals.-There is abundance of limestone in the parish,
but very little is burnt into lime, on account of the dearness
of fuel.  There is a rock on a hill, from which mill-stones
have been sometimes hewn, and rolled down the hill on an
axis; the stone is of that kind, called by the country peo-

kind, have been lately found.

   Animals.-The quadrupeds are horses, cows, sheep, swine,
dogs, cats, wild cats, pole-cats, weazels, martins, foxes, bad-

hare of a light blue colour in summer, and perfectly white
in winter.  The fowls are common hens, geese, ducks, pigeons,
wood pigeons, jays, woodcocks, magpies, rails, plovers, he-
rons, owls, partridges, nuirfowls, black cocks, crows hawks,
ravens, kites, eagles, and all the kinds of singing birds common
in the Highlands of Scotland.  A kind of brown hawk, which
nestles in a rock, half a mile from the village of Moulin, is
much esteemed by falconers, who come from different parts
of Scotland, and even of England, to carry away the young
ones.  The cuckow appears in the woods about the end of

comes about the middle of September, and goes away the 
middle of March.
