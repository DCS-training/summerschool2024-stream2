Considering the populousness of the parish, and the town
and villages which are in it, the proportion of poor is
as small as in the generality of parishes similarly circum-

of the last 7 years, amount annually to about L. 44, of
which the annual collection is L. 24.

liquors.  It were injustice to the generally sober and indu-
