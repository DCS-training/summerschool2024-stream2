seems to be little doubt of this village becoming a very con-
siderable place in a short time, from the many advantages
which it possesses with respect to its situation.  Both coal and
peat are to be had here at no great distance, and at a mode-
rate expense.  There is a small river contiguous to the
village, and the sea-port at Sarkfoot is not above a mile
distant from it.  The great road from England by Moffat
to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the great road by Dum-
fries to Port Patrick, and by Dumfries, Sanquhar, Muir-
kirk, &c. to Glasgow, all pass through this village.

   Roads.-There are two turnpike roads which pass through
this parish.  The road from England by Moffat to Edin-
burgh and to Glasgow, by Hamilton, and the road from
England by Drumfries to Port Patrick, and to Glasgow by
Sanquhar, Muirkirk, &c. and which roads separate at Head-
less-Cross, about 200 yards to the westward of the new vil-
lage of Springfield*.

   Graitney-Hall.-This house, in which an heritor former-
ly resided, is now fitted up in a very elegant and commo-
dious manner as an inn by the Earl of Hopeton, the pro-
prietor, where post-chaises are kept, and every accommo-

*There were no turnpike roads in this part of the country till the year
1777, when an act of Parliament was obtained for repairing certain roads
in the county of Dumfries, by the aid of tolls, and for commuting the sta-
tute-labour; the trustees under that act being empowered to assess the
proprietors and occupiers of land, in a sum not exceeding 12 s. on each
100 merks of valuation, for the purposes of repairing, and keeping in re-
pair, the different roads within the county.  The benefit which has been
derived from this act of Parliament has been universally felt and acknow-
ledged:  and it is from that period, and from this circumstance, that every
real and extensive improvement in this part of the country, and in the
county of Dumfries, is to be dated, and has arisen.
