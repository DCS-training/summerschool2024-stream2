	Ecclesiastical State.--The church is situated within the Mar-
quis of Ailsa's enclosures, is very convenient for the greater part
of the population, and about two or three miles from the extremi-
ties of the parish. It is said to have been a chapel belonging
to the family of Dun, the manshon-house of the family having
been built very near to the churchyard. The roof and ceil-
ing is so much decayed, that it is proposed at present to have
the church renewed. *  It affords accommodation to nearly 400
persons. There are no free sittings; but there are several pews,
belonging to the session, let yearly for a very small sum.
	It is not known when the oldest part of the manse was built;
but an addition of two rooms was made to it about fourteen years
ago. Some repairs in the manse and offices, and also some addi-
tions to the offices, were made in 1828.
	The extent of the glebe is betwixt five and six acres of very good
land, which may be valued at L. 20 a-year. The amount of stipend
is L. 150 yearly, including L. 33, 8s. 5d. from Government. There
are about 100 families, and 260 persons, attending the Established
