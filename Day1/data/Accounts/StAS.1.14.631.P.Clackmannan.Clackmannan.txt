demeanours, and from a general voluntary subscription by
the heritors, whether resident or non-resident, and all the 
inhabitants in the parish.  The heritors and kirk-session,
about 20 years ago, formed themselves into a committee,
which meets monthly, for the management of these funds.
Into this committee are chosen, from time to time, such
of the other inhabitants of the parish as are best acquaint-
ed with the state of the poor in their immediate neigh-
bourhood*.
   Subjoined is a table, showing the number of monhtly
pensioners in the parish of Clackmannan for 17 years prior
to 1794, together with an exact account of the money
received for the maintenance of the poor.  But besides
the regular pensioners, needy persons, from time to time,
receive extraordinary supplies.  These are not marked in
the following table; but the surplus will show the sum
alloted to them.

<FOOTNOTE>

*A clerk and treasurer receives a proper allowance yearly out of the 
funds for keeping the books, and paying the money to the poor.  These
receive charity in proportion to their wants; in general, from 2 s. to 6 s.
monthly, according as they are able to work less or more.  If, at any
time, they are in distress, without having any person to attend them, a
keeper is appointed to this office, and is paid out of the funds.  None of
the poor are allowed to beg; which seems to be a severe restraint upon
some of the idle ones.
   Before they are admitted upon the monthly roll, they are also obliged
to give to the treasurer an inventory of their effects, which at their
death, are disposed of for the benefit of the fund, provided they have no
children in need of them.
