     Statistical Account

are 5 lakes or lochs in the parish, in which anglers, who re-
pair to them for amusement, find abundance of pike, perch, 
and trout.  Grannoch, or Woodhall loch, is the largest in the 
district; it is about a quarter of a mill broad, and 2 1/2 miles
in length.

   Mineral Springs.-There are at least 5 mineral springs,
which, though they may vary in strength, seem all to pos
sess the same qualities.  The most remarkable is Lochenbreck
well, situated in the estate of Woodhall, the property of 
Walter Sloan Laurie, Esq. of Redcastle.  Of this the fol-
lowing account is given by Mr Eliezer Milligan, Surgeon at
Castle Douglas, (ci-devant Carlinwark.) " It is a strong
mineral spring, that for time immemorial has been fre-
quented by numbers every spring and summer season, for
behoof of their health; and its good effects have been fanc-
tioned by every one of the faculty that knows its virtues.
It is a chalybeate water, and perhaps one of the strongest 
of the kind in North Britain.  Being chemically tried by
many, it has been found to contain a strong impregnation
of that orc.  Persons afflicted with aguish complainst have
always found relief from its use, and, even in obstinate
intermittents, perfect cures have been made by it.  In
other complainst of the stomach, and in many female 
weaknesses, this water has been famously known to be 
most serviceable and restorative, even when patients have 
been given up by the faculty."  Some years ago, the pro-
prietor built a small house, in which lodgings may be had,
but still the want of proper accommodation, and of a road,
prevent the benefit of Lochenbreck well from being extend-
ed to so many as might otherwise receive it.  Feus, or buil-
ing-leases, may be had on very moderate terms.
