The strong cravings of nature lead them another way.  These,
being but ill supplied, produce violence, chagrin, jealousy,
and every ill passion.  Give them, and they are tolerably
quiet and orderly; but withhold or constrain, (both of which
are often absolutely necessary,) and they are clamorous, surly,
invidious, and bent on every practice within their reach, how-
ever criminal it may be, to obtain what they need.  The
manners of the inferior ranks in Stifling, must therefore be
necessarily rough, petulant and disagreeable.  Harrassed with
perpetual anxieties about daily bread, they have little or no
time to think of superior objects; and either will not, or can-
not come within the reach of those important lessons of divine
truth, which support the mind of man, and render him calm,
patient and composed, even although the field should yield no
corn.
   But what still farther induces this unwilling complaint,
against the manners of the poor, is a circumstance not peculiar
to Stirling, though it takes place there.  It is found in almost
every town, city, and borough, throughout Great Britain,
and is singularly disgraceful to a great and enlightened nation.
There is generally no room in churches for the accommoda-
tion of the poor.  They must either loiter away the days of
public solemnity, in sloth and vicious indulgence at home,
which they will very soon be inclined to do, or they must
stand at an awful distance, in some cold unoccupied areas
which very soon becomes irksome and intolerable.  Besides,
in such situations, it is scarcely possible they can receive much
advantage from public instruction.  Let a remedy be provid-
ed for this evil:  Let churches be built, or decent places pro-
vided for the accommodation of the poor, and their manners
would soon be corrected, at much less expence, and much
more effectually, than by thousands expended on the building
of bridewells and correction houses.  Charity employed in
