     of Forbes and Kearn.

   Cultivation.-The old mode of cultivation continues; the
old Scotch plough, drawn by 8, 10, and 12 oxen, and some
with horses and oxen together; one crop of bear and 3 of
corn, after dunging the infield; and 5 crops of corn on out-
field, after lathing.  The outfield lies other 5 years in natural
grass; but the infield generally goes on in the foresaid rota-
tion.  There is not an acre of land improved in this district;
excepting a few, which Mr. Grant of Driminner has improv-
ed, in the farm which he has in his own hands; all the rest
lies in the same state in which it was 30 years ago.

   Wood, Rivers and Fish, etc.-There are no artificial planta-
tions of timber in this district.  There is some natural wood along
the banks of the Don and the Bogie, consisting of aller, birch,
and some hagberry; but of no great extent or value.-The
river Don, which runs through a small part of the parish of
Forbes, and almost bounds it on the S. E. and S., is a beau-
tiful limpid stream, and abounds with fine burn trouts, some of
them 3 L b. and 4 L b. weight.  Some salmon come up in the spring,
and are taken with the rod and spear in summer.  It often
overflows its banks, and, as its motion is rapid, it does great
hurt to the crops in summer, and sometimes carries off great
quantities of corn in autumn.  The Bogie, which bounds Kearn
on the N. W. having its source and part of its course in mossy
ground, is naturally black and muddy.  It abounds, however,
with small burn trouts; but no salmon come up so far as Kearn.
It frequently also overflows its banks; but, as its motion is
slow, it does little hurt to the corn fields, either in summer or
autumn.  There is another small stream, called the Essel, which
divides Forbes from Tillinessle, and which has 1 lint and 3
corn mills on it.
