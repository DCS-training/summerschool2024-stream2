from the saw-mills, several of which have been erected within these
few years.

                MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   When the last Statistical Account was written, the agriculture
of this parish and of the surrounding district was probably farther
advanced than in most parts of Scotland, and it may not perhaps
since that time have made the same relative progress as has been
noticed in other places.  Still, however, a vast improvement has
been effected during the forty years that have elapsed, especially
in the upper division of the parish, which exhibits a very different
appearance from what it formerly presented.  The potato and
turnip husbandry was then just beginning to be introduced.  But
now it is skilfully prosecuted, and these valuable crops are raised
in abundance on all those farms which are adapted for the culti-
vation of them.
   Prior to 1790, the roads in the Carse were exceedhngly bad, so
that, unless in very favourable circumstances, the idea of bringing
lime or manure from any distance was not to be entertained.  Soon
after that the new line of turnpike from Perth to Dundee with its
different branches was opened, in which a great change to the
better has lately taken place, while the improvement which the
statute labour roads have undergone is too obvious not to be re-
marked.
   In 1796, fifteen thrashing-mills were built or building in this
parish alone.  Now there are riot fewer than thirt-two, all driven
by horses, excepting five or six on the higher grounds, which are
moved by water.  There is only one instance as yet in the Carse
of Gowrie bf the application of steam power to the thrashing-mill,
but it is understood to have fully justified the expectations which
were formed from it.
