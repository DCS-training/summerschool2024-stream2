if the summer be warm and rainy, the returns may then be from
six to eight.
   Rent.-The rent per acre of the large farms may average L. 2
or L. 2, 2s.  The average rent per acre of the Kilcoy lands,
though not yet so highly cultivated (they are liming) may be from
L. 1, 15s. to L. 2.  The remuneration of the farmer varies, of
course, with the markets.
    There are no fish-curers in this parish,-though a few boats
go every season for a few months to the Caithness herring fish-
ing, at great risk, and with great previous out-fits; they succeed
pretty well some seasons, and at other times they return with con-
siderable loss.
  The principal farmers rear upon their own farms, their own
horses and cattle, necessary for the farming purposes; from which
stock, they are able to sell a yearly portion of each kind.  In the
end of harvest, they buy a good many young cattle for the con-
sumption of their straw, and sell them at the surnmer markets,
sometimes with considerable profit.  They also buy in cattle and
sheep for feeding on turnip, for the fleshers at Inverness.  The
sheep are fed in folds on the field; and the cattle are fed in stalls
in their squares.
   Produce.-The average amount and value of raw produce year-
ly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol-
lows:
