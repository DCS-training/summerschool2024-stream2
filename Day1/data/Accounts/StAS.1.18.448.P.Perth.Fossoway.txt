   These avocations happened at different times, betwixt the
year 1661, and the year 1687.  There is a deficiency in the
register, from 1687, to 1691; but from that period, down

   Mr William Spence, admitted 21st September 1691; died
23d March 1715.  Mr Alexander Barton, ordained 23d April
1712; died 14th June 1716.  Mr Barton, was ordained as-
sistant and successor to Mr Spence, 3 years before his death,
and did not survive him 15 months.  Mr Andrew Ure, ad-
mitted 25th of April 1717; died 7th April 1742.  To him
succeeded Mr John Storer, ordained 25th August 1743;
died 8th June 1778.  All those ministers are remembered
