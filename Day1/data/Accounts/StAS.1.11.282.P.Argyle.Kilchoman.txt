     Statistical Account

   Roads and Bridges.-None of the Western Isles can boast
of such good roads and bridges as Islay.  The inhabitants are
every year called out to work upon them; and any gentleman
may drive for 30 miles through the isle in his carriage.  To
complete the line, our communication with the main shore
is kept up by a packet, which goes and returns regularly
every week, with the mail, passengers, and goods on board.
This packet has 40 L. of salary from the country, and 30 L.
from government.  The expence of government is more than
defrayed by the post-office here, as seafaring people, along
with those in the country, send a great many letters through
that channel.

   Proprietor and Rent.-Mr. CAMPBELL of Shawfield is
proprietor of the whole island, and possesses one of the best and
most compact estates, enjoyed by any commoner in Britain.
On the forfeiture of the M'Donalds, Islay, Jura, and the lands
of Muckairn, were made over to CampbelI of Calder, who
was then a favourite at court, on condition of his paying
500 L. yearly of a feu-duty out of Islay, which is the reason
of the duty being so high; and Calder sold all these lands
again to Shawfield, for 12,000 L.; which, if the rage for rent-
ing land continues, will, by and by, be the income from it.

<FOOTNOTE>

the most remarkable event of this district.  M'Lean, being married to M'Don-
ald's daughter, was to have part of Islay as her portion; but the treaty not be-
ing implemented, he came from Mull with 1400 of his clan, to force M'Donald
to a compliance.  M'Donald, with 1000 of his tribe, gave him battle, and des-
troyed the flower of his army.  M'Lean himself was killed with an arrow, and
lies interred in the kirk of Kilchoman.  A savage courtship indeed!  but such
were the times!  It is not certain how long the M'Donalds maintained their
dominion in Islay, and other place, after that are; but sure it is, that, by their
restless disposition, they at last forfeited them.
