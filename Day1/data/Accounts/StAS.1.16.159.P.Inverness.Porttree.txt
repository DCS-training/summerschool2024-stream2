other means of subsistence but by fishing, ferrying to Loch
Carron, Cishorn Strath, and other places, going on errands
and expresses, and other occasional employments.  There
is a very good harbour in Ronay, but no vessels put in
there, unless forced by the weather or other accidents.  The
conveniency of the school is a great advantage; and it is
also a considerable advantage, that from Sconcer to Acer-
said, and thence down to Snizort, is the best piece of made
road in all Sky.  Here, too, the latter end of every May
and July, is held a well known fair, to which all Sky, ex-
cept the districts of Strath, Heat, some from Uist and Har-
rish, bring their cattle.  The fair commonly continues
from Wednesday till the following Saturday; and while,
during that time, the cattle of others, some of them after a
long driving through moors and bad roads, are standing on
the moor, these in the neighbourhood of Portree are easily
sent to grass every night, and brought back again next
morning, by which means they look much fuller and bet-
ter.  But with respect to the farms immediately near the
market-place, this manifest advantage is perhaps often more
than balanced by the damage which their grass, and some-
times their corn suffers.  The numbers that, on these occa-
sions, flock from all parts to Portree, are immense; and
though there is a large, commodious, and well kept inn at
Acersaid, many, even of the best, are often put to their
shifts for lodgings.  Five miles south from Acersaid, at
the meeting of the three principal lines of road in Sky, is
the public house and post-office of Sconcer, from which, by
means of two runners, and the post from Inverness to Dun-
vegan, all the letters of Strath, Heat, Troternish, and
Mingnish are distributed.
