     Of Cullen.

Scotch acres, about Cullen, and in their other estates in the
counties of Banff and Moray; and, if we allow 4000 plants,
as usual, for every Scotch acre, the number originally plant-
ed, will exceed the amazing sum of 32,000,000 of trees.  All
these plantations, which at first were generally planted with
common firs, have been, with great care and attention, pro-
perly filled up with larch, and great variety of hard wood
plants, suited to the different soils; and all this upon ground
which never returned one farthing of rent to the proprietor.
   For the encouragement of those who have waste ground fit
for planting, I shall beg leave to quote the following curious
paragraph, from an account before me, attested by Mr. George
Brown, surveyor of land at Elgin, and factor to lord Find-
later there.  "To show in some degree the value of Lord
Findlater's plantations, and the very rapid progress they make
in this country near Elgin, there was a good deal cut out of
one plantation of common firs, to make room for more va-
luable and useful trees; many of those cut out measured of
girth 2 feet 10 inches and 3 feet, and sold at 3 d. Sterling the
tree, and, in general, when sawn down the middle, are large
enough for paleing and other uses.  This is a singular in-
stance of wood only planted 18 years, and shows the great
wealth that will accumulate from those plantations."

   Mountains.-There is only one remarkable mountain called
the Bin-hill; it has two tops, the one higher than the other,
it lies about a mile S. W. of the town of Cullen, about two
miles from the sea, and serves as a land-mark to the fishers.
Its elevation above the sea is said to be from 1000 to 1100
feet.  It was formerly covered with heath, but is now plant-
ed with trees.
