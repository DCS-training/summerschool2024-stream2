river turns between 20 and 30 mills, some of which have
been lately erected for the purpose of grinding barley and
wheat.  There are now turnpike, parochial roads, and
bridges made, and kept in good repair, by the toll-bar mo-
ney, and statute-labour commuted into money according to
the number of servants and horses.  The turnpike roads have
been the cause of many other improvements.  Coal, limes,
and the establishment of a woolen manufacture, are want-
ing.  The people are generally active and spirited, and have
always been ready to engage in labour of any kind:  Many of
them are, at present, both in the army and navy.  The poor,
in general, consider themselves able to bring up a family with
an income of about L. 12 Sterling.

   In 1782, and 1783, the situation of the inhabitants was
truly deplorable.  It was the end of December before the
harvest was finished, after a great part of the crop was de-
stroyed by frost and snow.  None of the farmers could pay
their rent; some of them lost from L. 200 to L. 500 Ster-
ling.  The country, however, was greatly relieved by the im-
portation of white pease from America.  Many found great 
advantage in feeding their cattle with furze or whins, beat
into a mash.  The poor were relieved by the expenditure of
the public funds, which supplied them with grain at a mo-
derate price.  There were likewise several liberal contribu-
tions for this purpose.  But the situation of this part of the
country, and, it is believed, of all the south of Scotland, was
still worse in 1766:  In consequence of a parching drought
during the whole summer, two thirds of the cattle were
slaughtered at Martinmas, and sold at 3 farthings a pound.
Many of those that remained died at the stall in the subse-
quent spring, after having consumed all the straw that could
be provided for them.  Bear straw sold at 1 s. 6 d. per threave.
