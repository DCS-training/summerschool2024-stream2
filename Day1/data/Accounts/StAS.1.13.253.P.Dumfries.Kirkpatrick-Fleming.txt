   There being no marl in this district, the manures chiefly
made use of for meliorating the soil, and raising crops, are
lime, and the dung collected upon the different farms.  Lit-
tle attention has hitherto been paid to the melioration and
improvement of pasture-grounds by manures, and it is
only till within these few years that any attempts to raise
crops of grass this way have been made; from the success
with which these attempts have already been rewarded, it
it to be hoped, that they will in future be frequently re-
peated.  The manures used for this purpose, are, ashes,
lime, and a composition of earth and lime; which last,
when properly mixed and compounded, forms a very rich
manure; and being spread plentifully upon the surface,
never fails to be followed successively with 2, and some-
times 3 very rich and luxuriant crops of grass.
   The crops to which most attention is paid in this pa-
rish, and which indeed most liberally reward the toils of
the husbandman, are oats, barley, and potatoes.  Of these,
oats are the most general, and perhaps, upon the whole,
the most valuable crop; a very considerable part of peo-
ples food depending on this grain.  Yet notwithstanding
what is exhausted this way, and in feeding horses, a large
quantity is annually furnished for the market.  The great
difference between the average produce, and that of the
best, is owing to the large quantity of land, not only
coarse, but in bad heart, which is annually sown with this
grain.  Barley may be considered, in a great measure, an
article for the market, though no inconsiderable quantity of
it too, is sometimes manufactured into a flour, of which a 
bread is made abundantly pleasant, and esteemed exceed-
ingly healthful.  The potato crop, though in a less sen-
sible manner, with equal certainty, repays the labours of
the husbandman.  As an article of food, potatoes are of
infinite value in his family, and for feeding horses and
