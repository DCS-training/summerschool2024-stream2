   Minerals and Mineral Springs.-There are quarries of
limestone at Cuttlebrae and Upper Clochin; of stones for 
building at Tarwathie; of state at Tarriemont and Upper 
Aldyloth, belonging to the Duke of Gordon; and of state 
on the estate of Lettersourie.  Near Litcheiston, there is a 
beautiful whitish sand in great quantity, and, in point of 
fineness, almost equal to any Dutch sand *. 

   Fuel.-Peat or turs from the hill of Oldmore, and the
other, mosses, is the fuel in common use.  As the mosses 
are at a considerable distance, fuel is ectremely dear, and 
in winter often very scarce.  The small cart-load of peats 
and turfs, sold last winter in Buckie at 1 s. 2 d. and some- 
times higher.  To give a clearer idea of the expense of 
fuel, it may be observed, that when the load is sold at 1 s. 
the consumer pays at the rate of a halfpenny for 4 peats 
and 1 turf.  Under such circumstances, as the few only are 
able to afford this heavy expense, it is evident, that Mr 
Dundas has done an essential service to the many, in pro- 
curing a repeal of the duty on coals, and merits well 
of his country, in general, for contributing to the comfort 
and happiness of numerous and an useful class of people, 
by redressing a real grievance.

*A well at Burn of Oxhill is much frequented by the country people 
with their children in the chincough; but as nothing is said of the be- 
nefit reaped from it, it is presumed, that its vogue is owing more to cu- 
stom than into its modulant qualries.  There are two chalybeate springs 
on Mr Bavon Gordon's lands; one at Gollachie, and another at New 
Buckie, requented fiona y n the summer-season.  At Findochie, a 
spring of furgative nature.  Pung out of a rock, far within flood-mark, 
is occasionally appkied to by the neighboorhood.
