   The moorland farms are several hundred acres in extent.
The great disparity of soil and situation, occasions a similar
disparity of the rent of land.  From 10 s. to 15 s. per acre
is a common rent for arable land; but some of it is no
higher than 6 s. or 7 s.  Some places, especially on the

are usually rented at L. 1, 10 s. per acre; but in many
parts of the moors an acre is not worth more than 6 d. and
in the mosses not worth 1 d.  The increase of manufactures
in the neighbourhood, and the advancement of agricultural
improvements, for which there is great room in the parish,
will probably raise considerably the value of land.  The
parish is supplied with seven corn-mills and two lint-mills,
which have abundance of water all times of the year.  To
there mills the most part of the parish yet continues to be
astricted.

   Trade.-Every encouragement is given the farmer by

bourhood, chiefly by Robert Dunmore of Ballindalloch, Esq.
This public-spirited gentleman, inspired with the am-

useful industry, began his improvements in the year 1788,
by establishing a muslin manufactory at Balfrone.  This
