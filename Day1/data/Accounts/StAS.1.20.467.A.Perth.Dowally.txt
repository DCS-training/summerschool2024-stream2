and of some casual donations*, they are now (1798) equal
to L. 36 Sterling.
   In 1783, the inhabitants of Dowally partook of the bene-
fit of the bounty of the Duke of Atholl, who, (as men-
tioned in the Account of Dunkeld), bought that year 500
bolls of meal, and sold it at a reduced price in this district
of the dukedom.  His Grace, at the same time, purchased
300 bolls of oats, and a large quantity of hay, which was
disposed of in a similar manner, and proved a most accept-
able and beneficial accommodation to many, who had suf-
fered severely from the inclemencies of the preceding sea-
son.  He brought also feed potatoes from England, and di-
stributed them gratis to his tenants.  Inhabitants of Dow-
ally! Let your grateful language to your Benefactor be that
of Elisha to the Shunamite, "Behold, thou hast been
"careful for us with all this care, What shall be done for
"thee +?"

     LIVE STOCK.

   Horses.-The number of horses in the parish is 197.
They are of a mixed breed, on an average, 12 hands high;
and at the usual rate of sale for some years past, may be va-
lued at L. 12 Sterling.  Hitherto, the parish has not reared
a sufficient number for its own supply.  The practice of
rearing foals has now, however, become frequent, and it is
probable, that in a few years the farmers will be able not
only to furnish this supply, but to afford some horses for
sale.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The casual donations alluded to, arise chiefly from the price of stray
sheep, which sometimes join the flocks on the tenants in the hill, as of whose
owners cannot be found.  These are sold for the benefit of the poor.
