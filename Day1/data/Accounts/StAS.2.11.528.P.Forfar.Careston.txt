formed into a new parish, thereafter named Careston, in favour of Sir
Alexander Carneggy, the proprietor of the above lands at that time.
	Some years thereafter, when this same baronet had made a
purchase of the farms of Craigend and Balnabreich, both in the
parish of, Brechin, and immediately eastward of that of Careston,
the same King executed an additional grant of the teinds of these
last farms in favour of Sir Alexander likewise; * but, although
this new grant was corroborated by the sanction of the Scot-
tish Parliament, it seems never to have been put in force,-
probably in consequence of the troubles of the latter part of the
King's reign, or, if these farms were then for a short season
united to the p`rish of Careston, of which there is now no proof,
yet they soon were again reunited to that of Brechin, on the
restoration of Episcopacy; and thus Careston, after this revo-
lution in ecclesiastical polity, continued as a parish, agreeable to
the state of its original formation.
  Changes of Proprietors who held Careston Estate.-Some cen-
turies of ago, this estate formed a small part of the very extensive
domain of the Earl of Crawford, who, for a time, was one of
the most potent amongst the Scottish nobility; as, besides many
different properties in the south of Scotland, now belonging to the
Duke of Buccleuch, and others, and the large districts of Loch-

Gordon in the north, the Earl held not a few valuable estates
both in Angus and Fifeshires. In the former of these he had
the three not far distant residences of Edzel, Careston, and
Finhaven; and, when in the south, he occupied Lindsay's Tower
or Castle Crawford, in the large barony of that same name in
Lanarkshire, from whence he had his title from King Robert
III. in 1397, the same year in which he overtbrew Lord Wel-
ler on London Bridge, in a tournament on St George's Day,
in presence of King Richard II., whereon that prince created
him Knight of the Garter. His own sovereign made him Earl
of Crawford; and, hn the infetment of that earldom, he is
designed fratri nostro; he being married to King Robert's sis-
ter, and daughter to King Robert II.; + and, in consequence

<FOOTNOTE>The present incumbent, with the full concurrence of his heritor, Mr Skene, had
a long process with the heritors of Brechin parish, for the purpose of rendering the
above second grant of King Charles valid; had he succeeded in this, his stipend,
then but small, amounting only to L.70 per annum, would have had an increase
of about L.30. Ultimately the Court of Session decided against his claim.
   It is highly probably that james de Lindsay would have been made an Earl by
King Roberts II., with whom he was a great favourite, until, out of envy, he trai-
