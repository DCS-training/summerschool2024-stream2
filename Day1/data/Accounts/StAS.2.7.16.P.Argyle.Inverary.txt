as to admit the air freely and to support a thatched roof.  The
quantity of bark produced here by an acre of coppice varies with
the age and crop of the trees, but generally it takes from 100 to
160 feet of oak timber to yield one ton of bark.  The larch is not
barked.
   The timber is conveyed to the shore. or saw-pit at an expense of
2 1/2d. per cubic foot.  Much of it is used for various purposes on
the estate, and much is also sent to market, where it commands a
ready sale.  The closeness of its fibrous texture may be estimated
by its weight, according to the following table:

   The climate, though variable, is favourable to the growth of
trees, * and when the nature of the soil in which they are planted
is considered, their increase must be deemed rapid.  When the
summer is cold, the sap must flow in a diminished quantity, and
the circular lines exhibited on the transverse section of the trees
is a sure indication of the season in which it became wood.
The following table exhibits the growth of a few -of the trees
planted in 1674 or afterwards, first from that period to 1798, + and
again, from 1798 to this date, and manifests the rate of their in-
crease.  The table exhibits their circumference five feet above the
ground.

The tallest of these trees has a stem of sixty feet; the others are
all lofty.
   The following table exhibits an average of the circumference of
four trees, measured from clumps planted in 1771, 1805, and 1808.

<FOOTNOTE>In the neighbouring parish, Glenurchy, and on the farm of Achalader, there
was, some years ago, a decaying oak of great length, which, after it had lost both the
bark and white wood, was 16 feet in circumference.
