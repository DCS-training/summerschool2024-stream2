labour is commuted.  Putting up the roads to auction, has
been the mean of getting them made much cheaper than
formerly.

   Improvements suggested.-It would be an advantage to this
parish, as well as to Eyemouth, if the mail-coach would drop
a bag, containing such letters as are addressed to the inhabi-
tants of each, which would relieve them from the expense
of sending to Berwick or Press.  If the woollen or cotton ma-
nufacture were introduced and encouraged here, the condi-
tion of the people might be greatly improved.  To take the
duty off coals carried coast-ways to Eyemouth, as is done at
Dunbar (to which port Eyemouth belongs) would great-
ly promote the establishment of manufactures.  This du-
ty yields but a mere trifle to government, and subjects the
people here to a state of entire dependence on Northum-
berland for fuel.  As the coal hills adjoining to this part of
the country are almost entirely engrossed by one person, it
would be rather surprising if he did not avail himself of this
advantage, by keeping up the price of so important an article.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The kelp made here is supposed
to be about 15 or 20 tons annually.  There are some quar-
ries in this parish, the stones of which answer for building,
and are supposed to be impregnated with an iron ore.  Free-
stone is confined to a small part of the shore.  The free-stone
must be transported to the harbour of Eyemouth, and then
carried by land.  Corn is carried to market in carts, which
have been used for the space of 40 or 50 years.  On the
hills on the south side of the parish are the remains of two
camps, supposed to be Roman or Saxon.  Several urns, and
broken pieces of armour, have been found here.  In the low
grounds towards the north-west, are the vestiges of three en-
