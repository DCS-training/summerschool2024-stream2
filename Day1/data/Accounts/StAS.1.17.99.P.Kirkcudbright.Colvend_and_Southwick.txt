Buittle.  It extends, in length, from E. to W. along the
coast of the Solway Frith, about 8 miles, and in breadth,
from N. to S. about 4 miles, forming nearly a right angled
parallelogram.  The parish church stands 20 miles S. W. from
Dumfries, 16 miles E. from Kirkcudbright, and 9 leagues, by
water, N. of the town of Whitehaven in Cumberland.

   Surface, Soil, Hills, etc.-The surface of this parish is ex-
tremely rough and irregular.  No extensive tracts of arable
land, or regular fields, are here to be met with; but only
small spots and patches, and even these much broke and in-
terrupted by rocks, large heaps or cairns of stones, and im-
penetrable copses of thorn, furze, and briers or bramble.  The
surface is generally uneven, all ascending or descending, but
the many rising grounds and hills are not very high.  For
near 2 miles towards the E. end of the parish, along the coast,
the country becomes more smooth and flat, and the fields
more regular, and mostly arable: But along the northern fron-
tier, especially towards the N. E. extremity of the parish,
there are very mountainous grounds covered with heath, and
running in a chain, into the skirts of the large and conspicu-
ous mountain Crow-fell*.  In such a country, it is next to
impossible to ascertain the precise quantity of arable ground,
or even to conjecture what proportion it bears, to the many
spots and large tracts of what may be pronounced incapable
of cultivation, and utterly unimprovable.  The soil is, for the
most part, a light loam, warm and fertile, adapted for pastu-
rage rather than tillage.  It would be much more productive,
were it not for a pernicious mixture of coarse sand, or rather
large particles of flint and crumbled granite stone, which too

and Westmorland, many of the large tracts of high mountainous
ground are called sells.
