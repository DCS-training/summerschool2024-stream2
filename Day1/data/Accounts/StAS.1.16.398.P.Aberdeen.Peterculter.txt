navy, and naval stores, would be a great acquisition to the
French; the Dutch sailors would be a much greater; and
Britain ought to make every exertion in order to prevent
their getting such an accession to their marine.
   Those persons who exclaim so vehemently against the
present war, do justly expose themselves to the suspicion of
being republicans and jacobins.  They seem to be out of
temper that their views have been so long disappointed.
If we had not gone to war with France; if the alien bill
had not passed; if our fleets and forces had not been
vigilant, Britain had, before now, swarmed with French
jacobins.  Before this time we had beheld, many of us had
experienced, the like tragical events, the like instances of
rapine and barbarity, of confusion and carnage, which have
been exhibited on the continent.  Writers on the subject
are clearly of this persuasion.  But the declaimers them-
selves need no proof; they have the most satisfactory in-
formation, they have entire conviction in their own breasts
Here, it is not to be forgotten, that after the French had
proceeded so far in the reform of their government; after
assassinations and massacres were committed, and commo-
tions prevailed throughout the kingdom, one of our Sena-
tors, one of these called Men of the People, said in the
House of Commons, that "our ministry ought to take ad-
"vantage of the distracted state of France;" a speech which
plainly insinuated our going to war.  The speeches of the
same gentleman now abound with bitter invective against
the present war, which was not commenced on our part,
until our allies were attacked, and we ourselves daringly
threatened; was not commenced until war became una-
voidable, unless we were timely to give up every thing
valuable to us as Britons, and dear to us as men and Chri-
stians.
