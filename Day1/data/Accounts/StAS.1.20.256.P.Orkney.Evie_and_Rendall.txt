fual, to officiate alternately in these condemned kirks, till 
the year 1788, when the danger became so conspicuous, that 
he fortunately deserted that of Evir, as the walls soon after-
wards tumbled down on a Sunday, and the materials were 
set up to auction.  The minister then travelled every Sun-
day to Rendall, and officiated in that ruinous house, (once
with only 17 hearers), till October 1794, when, having lost 
his health by officiating there, and that house also beco-
ming very hazardous, he was obliged, by the injunctions of 
his physician, to desert it; so that, since that period, there 
has been no public worship in this charge, except in the 
open air, in the church-yard.  He has repeatedly applied to 
the heritors, or their factors, and the very hard case of this 
charge has been often and warmly recommended by his 
presbytery and synod to the General Assembly, but no re-
dress has been obtained; and these matters continue in this 
deplorable situation at the present moment, September 
1797.
   After some litigation, and considerable expence to the mi-
nister, a new manse was built in 1784; but was neither 
floored nor plastered, (though the minister was obliged to

ceeding insufficient, receiving water at almost every part of 
the walls and roof; having been built by two contractors
from Edinburgh, whole accounts are said to be unsettled to 
this day.
   The stipend was decreeted in 1759, and is L. 51 : 6 : 8
Sterling, and L. 3 : 6 :8 for communion-elements, all in
money.  There are three glebes, one near the kirk of Ren-
dall; a very good one near thee manse; but, like the other 
farms, in detached parcels; and a third in the north end of 
Evie, two miles from the manse.  Of this last, the whole 
victual rent, (and for which the minister is accountable), is
