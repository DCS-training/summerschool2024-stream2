slowly; to which two circumstances chiefly contributed: 1st,
The whole farmers surrounding the moss threw every possi-
ble obstruction in their way.  2dly, By people of all denomi-
nations the scheme was viewed as a chimerical project, and
became a common topic of ridicule.  The plan, however,
supported itself; and in the year 1769 five more tenants
agreed for eight acres each; and thus 56 acres of Low Moss
were disposed of.  From the progress made by the first set-
tlers, and the addition of these, the obloquy of becoming a
moss tenant gradually became less regarded; so that in the
year 1772 two more were added; in 1773, three; and in
1774, one; in all 13: which disposed of 104 acres; all the
Low Moss to which water could then be conveyed.  As wa-
ter is the main spring of the operation, every tenant, beside
the attention necessary to his share of the principal stream,
collected water by every possible means, making ditches
round his portion of the moss, and a reservoir therein to re-
tain it till wanted.
   The tenants in the Low Moss having now begun to raise
good crops, in the year 1774 several persons offered to take
possessions in the High Moss, upon condition that access to
it should be rendered practicable.  The High Moss wanted
many advantages that the Low possessed.  To the Low Moss,
lying contiguous to the surrounding arable lands, the access
was tolerably good; but from the arable lands the High Moss
was separated by 300 or 400 yards of the Low, which, even
to a man, affords but indifferent footing, and to horses is
altogether impracticable.  The Low Moss is in general only
three feet deep; the High Moss is from six to twelve feet in
depth.
   It will appear at first fight, that without a road of com-
munication the High Moss must for ever have proved uncon-
querable.  Without delay, therefore, a road was opened to
