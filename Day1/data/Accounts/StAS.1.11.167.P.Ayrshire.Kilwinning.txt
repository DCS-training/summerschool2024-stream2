graceful to the laws of their country, and pernicious in the
highest degree to the morals of the people at large, but must
eventually bring, upon themselves, assessments, or poor rates.
Of all the taxes imposed on the people of England, this is one
of the most oppressive, and ruinous to the prosperity and im-
provement of their country.  In England, the poor's rates are
rapidly increasing to the enormous sum of THREE MILLIONS
STERLING yearly!  An evil of such magnitude ought most
anxiously to be guarded against, and, if possible, to be pre-
vented by every class of men in Scotland, and, in particular,
by the landed interest.  To render this tax unnecessary, or, at
all events, to lessen it, should it be found impossible to be al-
together prevented, every man of property, once a year, or
oftener if necessary, ought regularly to send the amount of
his weekly charity to his own parish church; and to every
other parish, a sum proportioned to the property he holds in
that parish.

   Ecclesiastical State.-There is at present but one clergyman,
the minister of the Established Church.  An Antiburgher
minister, ordained in 1762, died about 3 months ago.  The
stipend was augmented in 1786.  The living is now worth
140 L., besides a glebe of between 4 and 5 acres, and a very
excellent manse, built in 1773.  The church is a very beauti-
ful structure, built partly in the ancient Gothic taste, to corre-
spond to the venerable ruins of the monastery.  But though
it be almost 20 years since it was built, it has never been
seated.  This has been owing to an unhappy difference of
opinion among the heritors about the division of the area of
the church, and which is still unsettled.  The Earl of EGLIN-
TOUNE is patron of the parish.
