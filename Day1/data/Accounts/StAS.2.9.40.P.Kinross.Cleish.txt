Land-owners.-The chief land-owners are, Rear Admiral Sir
Charles Adam of Blair-Adam and Barns;* and John Young,
Esq. of Cleisb. There are at present 11 heritors in Cleisb, all of
whom except one have land above the yearly value of L. 50. The
number in 1744 was 24; many of their properties were small, and
were bought up from time to time by the contiguous heritors. One
Of the principal heritors resides always in the parish, the other oc-
casionally.

<FOOTNOTE>

Mr Henry Burt bequeathed the estate of Barns to Admiral Adam, who has
continued enclosing, cultivating, and planting, has rendered the mansion-house
a most conveniont iiwellin and has executed the large and important drain by
the straghtening and lowering the Gairney in the manner mentioned: and to
which may be added, that, besides making some private roads for the benefit of the es-
tate, he has contributed most liberally and usefully to an important public road
which goes through his property from a place called Red-Moss,upon the great north
road, to Cleish, to Tullybole, and the Crook of Devon.
