spatch and delivery of letters twice a-day.-The whole amount
of turnpike road in the parish cannot be less than about eight
miles.-Public carriages set out from Dalkeith,* or pass through it
almost every hour of the day.-The fields and gardens are en-
closed with fences of the best description.
   Bridges.-In the year 1594, there were two bridges at Dal-
keith,-one over the North Esk, and the other over the South
Esk. At that date these bridges were old and in a state of de-
cay, and were repaired by supplies provided by an act of Parlia-
ment. They were greatly damaged and nearly undermined by
the extraordinary floods of September 1659,+ but were again re-
paired by Parliamentary grant in 1663;-and a custom was impos-
ed on passengers to defray the expense. There seems to have
been no other bridge at that time over these rivers in the neigh-
bourhood of Dalkeith;-and attempts were made to avoid the
custom by passing at the ford over the South Esk, leading to-
wards the west of Dalkeith,-and the ford at Elginhaugh. An
act of Parliament, however, was obtained in 1670 to levy the cus-
toms also at these fords. Having again received great damage
from the ice and swelling of the water in the two great storms of
the winter of 1681, they were repaired anew by act of Parlia-
ment, in 1685.++ A new bridge was built over the North Esk at
Lugton in 1765, a few yards above the site of the old one; it was
widened and the approaches improved in 1816. In 1756 a bridge
was built over the South Esk at Newmills: it was widened and re-
paired in 1812: three new arches were thrown over it, one-half
of the breadth, in 1837, and the other in 1839. In 1797 a bridge

    This remarkable inundation has been recorded, and with great simplicity ac-
counted for by Nicoll:-"No sooner was the vivid. the pay begun to be exactit,
quhilk was upon the 1st of September 1659, to the great hurt of the subjects, bot
immediatelie thereafter the Lord did manifest his anger in sending doun ane unhard
and unkoth storme of wind and weit, be the space of three day is and thrie nyehtes,

belonging to Heriote's Hospital, with their damnes, water-gaugis, tymber and
stone workis, the haill qubeillis of their miles, tymber graith, and haill other workis
