     Statistical Account

"marched into Murrayland, which is the most fruitful country
"in Scotland, and the common proverb is, that it hath fifteen
"days more of summer than any other part of the nation."*
It is unnecessary to mention the praises given to it by Bu-
chanan and others.  The superior degree of dryness, perhaps
applies more to the level plains of Moray, along the sea side,
than to this parish, where more rain falls than in the lower
parts of the country.  But no place can enjoy a healther air
than this parish does, being hardly ever troubled with fogs,
or pernicious exhalations; and the rivers, so far from being
hurtful, rather tend to purify the air, by the rapidity of their
course.  There are no diseases peculiar to this part of the
country. 

   Fruit, Orchard, etc.-In the valley of Logie, which is the
warmest part of the parish, standard and wall fruit trees grow
well.  Mr CUMMING of LOGIE:, besides an excellent garden,
a good many years ago planted 4 Scotch acres of ground with
fruit trees.  This beautiful orchard is close to the Findhorn,
exposed to the south; but on all other sides well sheltered by
higher grounds, and tall forest trees In favourable seasons,
it already richly repays the expence of planting and inclosing.

   Soil, Cultivation and Produce.-The soil of the lower part
of the parish, near the rivers, is of a light dry quality, rather
tending to sandy; but, when properly managed, very fertile
and productive.  A very great proportion of the parish con-
sists of muir and moss; great part of which might be improv-
ed, it lime, of which there is none in this parish, could be pro-
cured.  For though there is some in the parish of Forres, it is
too expensive an article for common tenants to purchase, and
