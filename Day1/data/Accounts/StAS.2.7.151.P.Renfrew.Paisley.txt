rish in very great quantities, as few trials comparatively have been
made for it, in many places where there is at least a strong pro-
bability that it might be found.  It has been found within the
town of Paisley, as at Gallowgreen; also near Meikleriggs; but
by far the most profitable pits have been at Quarrelton and Hurlet.
   The coal of Quarrelton consists of five continuous strata, which,
in a field of about fifteen acres, is found to dip in several different
directions, as towards a centre, thus, forming a basin, but having
its strata somewhat interrupted by hitches, at one of which the
mass of coal is thrown up about 50 feet, and at another about 30
feet.  These hitches interrupt not only the direction, but also the
degree of dip.
   The following section of the coal strata at Quarrelton we ex-
tract from the article " Mine," in the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.
It was drawn up by the ingenious Robert Bald, Esq. civil-engin-
cer; and we have tested its accuracy.

   The above is a very interesting section of a coal field, which,
according to Werner, belongs to the newest flaetz trap formation.
The striking peculiarities are:-1. The great body of greenstone
of the common crystallized texture, known in Scotland by the
name of blue whinstone, found at the surface, and, lying above the
common coal strata, which are comparatively soft, and have lit-
tle coherence.
   2. The vast body of coal lying together, consisting of ten beds.
There are only seven beds in the section, but the fourth coal is
commonly reckoned three beds, and the lower coal two beds there
being a difference in the quality, with thin divisions in some places
betwixt them.  The whole, thickness is 90 feet 2 inches.  Some
of the coal is of the open burning kind, but the great part is of
the close burning quality, similar to Newcastle coal, and breaks
into small pieces.  The coal abounds with inflammable air, and is
liable to spontaneous ignition.  In a great part of this coal-field, the
coals amount to only one-half of the thickness represented in the
