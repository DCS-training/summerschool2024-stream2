                               III.-POPULATION.

           The only way by which an estimate can be formed of the an-
        cient state of the population of the parish is that of consulting the
        baptismal register.   It appears that, even so far back as 1578, the
        number of baptisms which were registered was 59: that in 1632
        the number was 72 ; and that in 1728, nearly a century later, it
        was no higher.  Judging from a comparison of the baptismal re-
        gisters, the population of the whole parish even in 1632, must have
        been upwards of 2000; and ht is known that, in point of fact, it was
        in 1743 not less than 2229.  The population of the landward por-
        tion does not, at the present day, amount to more than about 1720,
        and, as the population of the village is supposed to have been near-
        ly doubled within the last hundred years, that of the former can
        scarcely, if at all, have increased.  The increase in the. village has
        been owing chiefly to the improvement of manufactures.  Where
        any diminution has taken place in the landward part of the parish,
        it seems to have been occasioned by the Uniting of two or more
        small farms into one.

        and corrected to the present daie.
