which they produce. For durability and strength of heat, the best
Bannockburn coal is scarcely equalled, and certainly not surpas-
sed, by any other coal in Scotland.

   The soils of the parish may be arranged under three varieties
1. the new alluvial or carse; 2. the old alluvial; 3. the untran-
sported, or that which is formed by the disintegration of the trap
rocks. The old alluvial may be subdivided into the dryfield and
moorland-tbe one is upon a gravelly subsoil, whilst the subsoil of
the other is a retentive clay. The following analysis will show the
constituent parts of the old alluvial and untransported soils:

   Much is doing in the parish to improve the soil. Draining
and trenching, and an improved mode of cropping, will soon banish
from the farmer's nomenclature such terms as sour soil, wet soil,
stiff soil.
