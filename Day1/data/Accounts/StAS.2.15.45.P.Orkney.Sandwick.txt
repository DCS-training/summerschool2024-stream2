badoes, and devastated that and other West India islands; but the
gale never reached Orkney, though its effects on the sea were so
conspicuous.
  Climate.-Our insular situation prevents the extremes, of tem-
perature that are felt in continents of such a high latitude, the
surrounding ocean tempering the heat of summer, and the cold of
winter; so that for more than twelve years, the thermometer has
only once fallen so low as 18&deg; of Fahrenheit, and the snow does not
lie so long here, as in the more inland parts of the south of Scot-
land, or, I believe, the north of England. Indeed, the mean tem-
perature of every month was above the freezing point, except that
of February 1838. Our mean annual temperature is 46&deg; 25', and
the mean height of the barometer 29.640, as will be seen from the
annexed tables; but the nature of our climate will be more cor-
rectly understood by comparing the mean temperature of each
month, as there stated, with that of other places. The highest hill
commands an extensive view, not only of the west mainland, but
of part of the north and south isles, and from it, and other
elevated grounds, may be seen the hills of Hoy, terminat-
ing in stupendous precipices; and, in calm and clear weather,
those of Sutherland in the distance, stretching out towards
Cape Wrath, add much to the beauty of the scene; but during a
storm from the west it is awfully grand. The huge accumulations
of water that then roll after each other, foaming with terrible vio-
lence to the shore, impress the mind with their irresistible power,
and might well give a stranger a feeling of insecurity; and, when
they dash themselves against the precipice, it seems half sunk, for
a time, like a wrecked vessel amid the waves; sheets of spray are
thrown far up into the air, and carried over all the country, making
springs a mile from the coast brackish, for some days and encrust-
ing every thing with salt, even fifteen or twenty miles off. I am
told by those living a few hundred yards from the spot, that the
floors of their cottages are shaken by the violence with which
the waves strike the crags; and I have seen innumerable sea insects
alive on their summits, and even a limpet adhering to them after
such a storm ; also numerous fragments of the slaty stone, some
of them a foot long, which had been whirled into the air, and had
penetrated six inches into the soil in falling.
   Our climate, in short, is more remarkable for dampness and
storms, than -for cold; the atmosphere being often loaded with
sea spray in winter, and moistened with the constant evaporation
in summer. Pulmonary and rheumatic complaints seem to be pre-
