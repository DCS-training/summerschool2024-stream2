parish every Wednesday and Saturday, which is supplied by
butchers from Tranent and Musselburgh, no person of that
occupation residing in the parish.  Though nine tenths of

their livelihood solely on farming.-There are only 5 brewers
'in the parish*.  There are two mills, one of which, at the
west end of Cuttle, is turned by the water of a coal-level;
the other, at Morison's Haven, is turned by the sea water,
collected at the flow of the tide.  They are employed in
grinding flint for the use of the potteries.

   Stage and Tolls.- A stage coach goes to Edinburgh and re-
turns every day in the week, except Sunday.  It departs at
9 o'clock in the morning, and arrives at Edinburgh about 1 L.
It leaves Edinburgh at 4 in the afternoon, and arrives at Pres-
ton-pans about 6.  It carries 6 inside passengers; the fare is
1 s. 8 d. for each.  There are a toll-bars, Ravenshaugh toll
on the post road, and Wallyford toll, on a cross road lead-
ing to Dalkeith.  There tolls, of which the last mentioned
draws a mere trifle, were let at the following yearly rents.
