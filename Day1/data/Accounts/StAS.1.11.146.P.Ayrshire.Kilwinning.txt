inoculate their children, would be thought inconsistent with
the liberty of British subjects, and even with the common
principles of humanity.  But as the prosperity, nay the very
existence of every country, is inseparably connected with the
number of its inhabitants, something certainly ought to be
attempted, to render, if possible, inoculation in Scotland more
general than it is at present.  With a view to this, the fol-
lowing outlines of a scheme are humbly proposed.

   1st, That by an act of parliament, all the surgeons in Scot-
land be appointed, under certain penalties, to keep regular
separate lists, both of these children who are inoculated by
them, and of those under their care, who take the disease in
the natural way; and to state the precise number of such as
die of the inoculated, and of the natural small pox.
   2dly.  In order to fix, with the utmost certainty, the exact
number of those children who take the natural small pox,
that all parents be appointed, by the same authority, and un-
der the same penalties, to inform their family surgeons, even
of such of their children, as have the disease in such a fa-
vourable way as not to need the assistance of a surgeon.
   3dly, That those lists be signed, and sent to Edinburgh,
once every year, or oftener, if it shall be judged necessary;
and printed under the particular direction of government.
   4thly, That when printed, these lists shall be immediately
transmitted to the magistrates and clergy of every town, and
to the justices of the peace, and the clergy of every country
parish, to be by them distributed, and made as universally
known as possible among the people.
   5thly, That a salary to the surgeons, adequate to their
trouble, be established by government; as well as a fund for
inoculating the children of the poor.
