     employed in farm labour, except the few artisans employed by the
     inhabitants. There is nothing in the way of manufacturing, if we
     except the home-made cloths manufactured by the families.  The
     quantity of this, however, is diminishing, as they find it more pro-
     fitable to sell their wool, and to purchase cloth.  There are weav-
     ers, 6; tailors, 5; blacksmitbs, 3; and carpenters, 7; and 1 cooper.
     These are kept in employment by the country people. There are
     also a few dry-stone masons for building houses, dikes, &e.  Every
     man is his own shoemaker, or rather brogue-maker; a shoemaker
     has, however, lately settled in the country. Some of the people ge-
     nerally keep a few articles, such as snuff, tobacco, &c. for retail; but
     there is no regular shop in the parish.  Few of the tenants keep
     men-servants, since their children generally remain with them un-
     til they marry, or settle otherwise; but on large farms there are,
     between agriculturists and shepherds, above the age of twenty,
     about 25 male servants, and under that age, 53; female servants, 37.
          Agriculture.- There is little of the parish, in proportion to its size,
     under cultivation; at the utmost, it is but 2820 acres, and a great
     part of this is merely outshot, or occasionally under tillage. Besides
     this, the number of acres in waste, including the hill pasture, is
     93,180 imperial acres.  There is little of this which could be pro-
     fitably made arable, since sheep pay so well; and probably not
     more than 1300 acres are improvable with advantage.
          A considerable part of the hill pasture is in common, especially
     where there are two or three tenants in one farm and the extent
     of this commonty may be fairly estimated at 23,000 acres.  Wood
     is generally scarce of late years; but planting is becoming more
     general. Mr Macbean of Tomatin has planted about a million and
     a-half of larch and fir trees, on his property; and there are con-
     siderable old plantations on the estate of Mackintosh near Moy Hall.
     The total extent under wood is
