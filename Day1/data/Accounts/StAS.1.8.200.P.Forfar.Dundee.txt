deed, hitherto, but insufficiently drained, and the houses to
the south, which border on them, exhibit some inconsiderable
marks of dampness.  But the principal causes of unhealthi-
ness in Dundee, are the height of the houses, the narrowness
of the tenements and of some streets, by which the people
were too much crowded upon one another.  The bounds of
the royalty were too confined for the increasing number of the
inhabitants, and it was only within the last 30 years, that
they began to extend their buildings beyond its limits.  But
with all these defects, Dundee may be considered as a very
healthy place; the small-pox, indeed, is often epidemical
and fatal, for inoculation is, hitherto, but imperfectly intro-
duced; but fevers are seldom infectious, and agues almost
unknown.  The crowded places of the town, indeed, are un-
favourable to children, but probably not more so than other
crowded places; and as one evidence of its healthiness, it may
be mentioned, that in a district containing 1800 inhabitants,
only two persons, in the summer of 1789, were found confin-
ed to bed.  Less rain falls here than at Perth, for, by the
Carse and Siedlaw hills to the north, and the Fife hills to the
south, the clouds are attracted, and frequently carried away
from this town and neighbourhood*.  The village of the Fer-
ry; in particular, at the east end of the parish, near Broughty
castle, is uncommonly dry and wholesome, and, perhaps, bet-
ter fitted for sea-bathing, than any other place on the east
coast of Scotland.  The molt frequent endemial diseases are con-
sumptions and the scrophula, by which last, perhaps, the for-
mer are principally produced.  The scrophula seems chiefly
to affect the families of linen-weavers, who sometimes feed
poorly, and whose manufacture is carried on in damp and
low floors.  We have no lake, or even pool of standing
