there have been no deaths among the debtors, and only 4 among the

	The average number of delinquents committed yearly during

1765 to 1830, 89 persons were executed in Glasgow, of which
number 5 were females. During the first 12 years there were only
6 persons executed, whilst in the last 12 there were 37. During

executions, 15 in which there was 1 each year; ten, 2; seven, 3;
four, 4; one, 5; and two in which there were 6. From the 29th

been executed in Glasgow, viz. 11 males, and 1 female; of whom
6 were for murder, 1 for rape, 1 for hamesucken, 1 for robbery,
and 3 for housebreaking and theft. From the 4th of May 1818,

females for issuing forged bank notes.
	Bridewell.--The Bridewell in Duke Street was opened on the
8th of May 1798, and supported by the corporation funds for up-
wards of twenty-four years. This building, which still remains,
consists of six stories, and contains 105 cells. Although but ill
suited for classification, it answered the purpose for a number of
years; but, from the great increase of population, and consequently
of crime, in the city and county, it was agreed that the new build-
ings should be so large as to contain the city and county prisoners,
combining the improvements which experience had pointed out.
The authorities having procured an act of Parliament for assessing
the city and county for building and maintaining a Bridewell, they
erected a set of buildings so well suited for the purpose, as to be

of modern improvement, security. seclusion, complete classifica-
