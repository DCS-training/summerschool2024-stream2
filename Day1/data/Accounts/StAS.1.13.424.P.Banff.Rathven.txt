and the example of one is frequently followed by all; and
yet, what is singular, no one seems to possess a character
decisive enough to take the lead, and to rise to superiority
by the strength of genius, or the arts of address.  No mo-
ral duty is seldomer violated by them than chastity.  They
go to sea as boys, at 14 years of age, become men at 18,
and marry soon after; for it is a maxim with them, appa-
