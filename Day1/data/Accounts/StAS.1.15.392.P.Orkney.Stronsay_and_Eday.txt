North West, which is the widest and safest; and the other
from the East; a stranger, however, would require a pilot, as
the West entry is intricate, and the East one narrow and
dangerous.  Small vessels can ride here safely at all seasons.
   There are bays also on the East, South, West, and North
West sides, in which vessels may drop anchor, and ride safe-
ly, if the wind do not blow strong on shore.  There are two
good harbours or road steads in the island of Eday; Fairs-
ness Sound, on the West side, sheltered by the small isle of
Fairay, and Calf Sound, on the North end, sheltered by the
Calf of Eday.  Vessels of great burden may ride at anchor
safely in these road-steads, each of which has the advantage
of two entries.  There is also a bay on the South end of E-
day, where vessels may ride safely, if the wind do not blow
strong on shore.

florins of the Rhine; the islands of Orkney and Shotland
were mortgaged for that sum, and afterwards annexed to the
Crown of Scotland.  It was stipulated, that the laws and pri-
vileges of the inhabitants should remain inviolable.
   That some traces of the manners, customs, language, and
laws of the Norwegians, are still to be found in these islands,
may be naturally expected; owing to which, improvements
in farming, and other arts, have been severely checked or
much retarded; and the state of property, of course influen-

   Heritable property in Orkney may be considered as divid-
ed into Kings lands, kirk lands, and udal lands.  The whole
rents of the first mentioned, being demesne lands, were an-
