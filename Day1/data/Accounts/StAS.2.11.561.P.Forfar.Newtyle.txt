the Haltoun to the Bishop Aberdeen, William Chrystie, boxmaster,
has no more to count for of collection at Haltoun, save seven
pounds, three shillings, and ten pennies," Scots money.
	The last mention made of the Bishop is of date 28th, May 1710,
stating his having preached the action sertmon of that day on Ro-
mans viii. 9. and the collection made to be L.01, los. Scots money.
It is not, however, till 12th September 1719, that, after judicial
procedure, we find the Presbyterian minister of the parish, as the
record shows, granting receipt for the records, registers, church:
utensils, &c., as being then given up to him and the kirk-session.
	In the beginning of the volume commencing 1717, there is an
account given of occurrences during the blank period in the re-
cords, from which it appears that, in the Rebellion of 1715, the
minister of the parish was prevented by armed interference from
preaching in the church, his house outrageously entered by sol-
diers, himself threatened, and forced to "abscond" for a time.
  Land-owners.-The Right Honourable Lord Wharncliffe is the
principal heritor, and proprietor of nearly the whole of the parish.
His residence, when in the country, is Belmont Castle, in the pa-
rish of Meigle. Andrew Whitton, Esq. of Couston, and Patrick
Miller, Esq. of Davidston, are the only other heritors.  There
is no resident heritor in the parish.  Ballantyne or Bannatyne
House, near the Kirkton, seems to have been, at no very remote
period, occupied as a mansion-house. The plan on which this
building was erected, appears not to have been completed.
  Valued Rent.-Property of Lord Wharncliffe, L. 2476, 13s.
4d.; Andrew Whitton of Couston, L.133, 6s. 8d.; Patrick Lil-
ler of Davidston, L.120.

	The increase of population has arisen from the erection of a
new village in the parish. In 1832, a field of arable ground of
about 15 imperial acres, the property of the, Right Honourable
Lord Wharncliffe, was laid out on a regular plan, to be let in lots
for building, on leases for ninety-nine years. The railway from
Dundee terminated, at the time in this field. The site for the
new village appeared an eligible one; a number of building stances
were disposed of in lots, consisting of from about 19 to 27 poles,
