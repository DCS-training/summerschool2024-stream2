	   Geology and Mineralogy.-The geological construction of the
	parish and the character of the minerals correspond with the di-
	vision above referred to,-sandstone prevailing in the south, and
	whinstone in the north.  Coal is found at several places, and at
	present there are two collieries,-one at Kellie, and another at
	Cassingray.  The Kellie consists of two main seams of cherry
	coal, distinguished among the workmen as the back and the fore,
	the one being 7 feet thick, and the other 5 feet.  The metals
	cut through in the engine pit are, 3 feet of clay, 9 feet of faiks,
	12 feet of till mixed with faiks, 12 feet of gray faiks, 6 feet of
	white blaise or till, 12 feet of freestone pavement, 2 1/2 feet of hard
	white sandstone, 6 feet of till with gray faiks, 6 feet of freestone,
	5 feet of soft till or blaise, 1 1/2 feet of hard stone mixed with lime,
	5 feet of gray faiks, 6 1/2 feet of pelt, 2 1/2 feet of hard sandstone
	mixed with whinstone, 18 1/2 feet of freestone pavement, 6 1/2 feet of
	gray faiks, 3 feet of soft blue till, 2 1/2 feet of limestone roof above
	the coal, 5 feet of cherry coal.  The price of this coal at the pit
	is 1s. per load of four cwt.  It is found at 21 fathoms, with a dip
	of 5 to 1 west by north.  From 15 to 20 men are employed at the
	works.
	   The Cassingray coal consists of 6 regular seams, and 1 seam
	found occasionaly 2 to 3 feet thick when it holds, and of excel-
	lent quality.  The first regular seam is the marl coal, dipping to
	the south, 3 feet thick, and very near the surface.  The second
	is a splint coal, about 14 inches thick, and found at from 7 to 8
	fathoms.  The third is also a splint coal, 3 feet 10 inches thick,
	of excellent quality, and found at 38 fathoms.  The fourth is si-
	milar in quality, and 3 1/2 feet thick.  The fifth is what is called
	the scarrot loft, and almost close to the black coal.  The sixth,
	again, is a splint coal, 4 fathoms below the scarrot loft, 18 inches
	thick, and of the best quality.  The dip of all these seams is as
	1 in 6, but in different directions,-the coal on the north side of
	Cassingray dipping to the north-west, and that on the south dip-
	ping due south, while it is to be observed that the crops of both
	approach very near to each other, not far from the place where
	the pigeon house now stands.  The metals cut through in the
	engine pit are 2 fathoms of clay, 15 fathoms of sandstone, 5 fa-
	thoms 2 feet of till or shale, 22 inches of limestone, 11 fathoms
	of sandstone, 4 feet of till, 15 inches of a black stone called pe
	and 7 inches of coarse parrot above the coal.  The prices of this
	coal at the pit is 1s. 2d. per load of four cwt.  There art 38 col-
