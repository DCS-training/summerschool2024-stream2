sides the Roman bridge above mentioned, there is still an-
other bridge over the Calder, upon a less public road.

   Climate, etc.-The air here is pretty dry and clear, fogs
of any continuance never being remembered, except in the 
year 1783: It is mild, compared with that on the higher
lands but fevers and the small-pox, at distant period.  Agues

quarries, of a good quality, abound here; in one of them there

stand detached along the road.  In two places only there are
clusters nearly together, which may be called small villages, 
there being 15 houses in the one, and 12 in the other.  The
