   Commerce.  When King Alexander gave Elgyn the char-
ter of guildry, there doubtless existed some foreign, as well
as domestic trade.  It is certain, that in 1249, a French no-
bleman, (the Count de St. Paul and Blois,) had a ship of war
built at Inverness, at no great distance from Elgyn*.  It ap-

L. 2000 Sterling.  There are now 44 shops opened in this
town, principally for the sale of imported goods.
   In the end of last century, and about the 1722, there was
a considerable export of malt, from this place to Norway.-
There were then above 30 malt barns, always employed,
but the people at Dunbar supplanted them greatly, and the
malt tax completed its ruin.  Gloves were made here, some
years ago, in great perfection, and a number sent to different
markets.  That trade is much on the decline.  The spinning
