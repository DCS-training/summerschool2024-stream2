yearly rent.  The church is an elegant structure.  It is
92 feet long, and 45 broad, with a convenient session-
house adjoined.  A new church is now building for the
Gaelic congregation, and will be completed in the course
of next summer, at the joint and equal expense of the he-

of L. 110 Sterling, being the interest arising from Mr
George Duncan's mortification formerly mentioned.  This
church is 76 feet in length, and 38 in breadth.  There is

but small.  There is likewise a Methodist meeting house,
which is attended chiefly by the manufacturers lately
come hither from other places.

   Roads and Bridges.-There are 2 military roads which
pass through this parish; and which are kept in good re-

attended to.  The statute-labour is partly commuted.  There
are 3 bridges, the principal of them is the bridge over the
Ness, a beautiful structure of seven arches.  It was built

town.

are some who love whisky rather much; but not so much,
