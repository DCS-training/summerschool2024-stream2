in this part of the country, which lays often a heavy tax on the
minister, especially when the heritors happen to be non-resident.
Dr Whyte of Bombay, grandson of one of the former ministers
of Rosskeen, left L.2000 to the poor of the parish, the interest to
be given, in certain specified proportions, to the modest poor.
   In general, none except the miserably poor ever think of apply-
ing for parochial relief.
   Fairs.-There are five fairs, held annually at Invergordon ; in
February, April, August, October, and December.
   Inns.-There are no less than 24 inns and alehouses, 15 of
which, by far too many, are in the village of Invergordon. Drunk-
enness can, however, by no means be imputed as a general vice,
to the people.
   Fuel.-The fuel used by the humbler classes is peats, of which
abundance can be easily procured. By the wealthier inhabitants,
coals (English) are used, as they can be obtained here at a very
moderate price.
               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   In many respects, this parish has been improved within the last
forty years ; but the depopulation of the country by large farms, is a
serious evil, and is likely to bring along with it consequences which
the landed interest seem not to have contemplated. There is no long-
er an independent peasantry. The morals of the people are deterio-
rated by the loss of independence, and their spirits embittered by what
they deem oppression. The ties which united master and tenant are
severed ; and when the time comes, to which we look forward with
fearful anticipations, it will, we fear, be found, that an error has
been committed, by grasping too much, at the risk of sooner or
later losing all.
