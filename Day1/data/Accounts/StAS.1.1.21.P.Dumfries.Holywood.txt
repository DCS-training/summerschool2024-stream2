to the last, only not so deep and wet; it produces a kind of
grass, neither very fine nor very coarse, which, in some of
the higher parts of the hills, is mixed with heath, and a few
other hard weeds.

   Air, Climate, etc.-The air is dry, and remarkably whole-
some.  The singular healthiness of the inhabitants may, how-
ever, be attributed to the following causes.  They do not
live in towns, or even villages; they are not employed in fe-
dentary occupations; being either country gentlemen or far-
mers, they live in houses detached from each other; they are
engaged in active employments in the open air; they are in-
dustrious, sober, and chearful.  The dryness of the air is
owing to the peculiar local situation of the parish.  The 
clouds, intercepted by the hills on every side, float in fogs on
the top of them, while the inhabitants enjoy a clear and dry
air in the valley.  At other times, when the clouds break in-
to rain on the hills, the greatest part of it falls on the hills,
or the sides of the valley, while the skirts of the showers only
reach its central parts.  Add to these circumstances, that the
two rapid rivers carry off the superfluous water from the land,
and the moisture from the air.

   Seed-time and Harvest.-The time of sowing wheat is from
the middle of September to the middle of October; oats,
pease, beans, hemp, and flax, from the 10th of March to the
middle of April; potatoes and barley from the middle of
April to the 10th of May; and turnips from the 10th to the
24th of June.  The harvest generally begins about, or before,
the middle of August; and the crop is got totally into the
barns, and barn-yards, by the end of September.  In cold 
and wet seasons, like the last, it is, however, somewhat later.
