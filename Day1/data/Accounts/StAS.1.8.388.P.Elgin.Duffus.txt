The lake of Spiney has been allowed to spread for miles, be-
yond its original bed, and to cover, in whole, or in part, a
large portion of very rich ground.  A few years ago, an im-
perfect attempt was made to draw off the water from the up-
per grounds, by which some hundreds a-year were gained to
the proprietors; but a complete draining, which is very prac-
icable, and would be deemed easy in other countries, would
produce thousands.

   Cultivation.-Agriculture, with a few exceptions, is here
in a very low state.  The old plan of incessant tillage, with-
out rest to the ground, or without having any sufficient pro-
portion of it sown out in grass, or other green crops, still pre-
vails.  Grass, on the little spots where it is sown, thrives re-

purpose.  No wonder then that farming has not advanced.
Our farms are small, and we have no subtenants.  The pa-
rish is totally open, excepting such inclosures as are round
gentlemen's places.  Various are the evils incident to open
fields.  One of the most teasing, and not the least hurtful, is the
devastation incessantly made by our half starved cattle, upon
the adjoining corn fields, whose hunger impels them to break
from the range of grass, to which they are staked, or from
the charge of careless boys and girls let to watch them.-Sea-
weed is much used for a manure.

   Services.-Some services are still continued here; and upon one
estate, the tenth sheaf is drawn in teind from the field, as part
of the rent.  Rent is paid chiefly in grain, often at the rate
of a guinea per acre,-a price not too high for the quality of the
ground; but too high without leases, strength or skill to cul-
tivate it.  The abject spirit of feudal habits, has made our
