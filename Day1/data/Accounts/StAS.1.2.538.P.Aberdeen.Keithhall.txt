   Expenses of a common Labourer's Family.-  The expence of a
labourer, and his mode of living, are very different, according
as he has a cow and an acre of land, or only a house and small
garden.  In the first case, a peck of bear meal is mixed with
two or three pecks of oat meal for bread; and a man and his
wife, with 3 or 4 children, will live tolerably well, with milk

   And oat meal was converted at 10 s Scots, or 1 s 6 d Sterling.  Thus
the price of provisions was really much cheaper, in 1576 than in
1438, though the nominal value was higher.  In 1591, at the valua-
tion of the effects, and confirming of the testament of Mrs Catherine
Grant, wheat was valued at L. 3 Scots, or 7 s and 8 d Sterling.
Only three year before that period, viz. in 1588, there was a
famine, and oat meal sold for L. 18. Scots, or L. 2: 6: 1, 
Sterling per boll.  In regard to the expence of cloaths, it appears,
from the records of the City of Aberdeen, (from which all the
Statements in this note are taken) that the Town Council of
Aberdeen gave Manns or Magnus Cobbar, 20 d or 1 s and 8 d
Scots, in 1498, to buy a coat for ringing his bell once a week.
This coat to the bell man must have been coarse, yet it certainly
was cheap, as 20 d Scots at that time were equal to only 9 d Ster-
ling.  In regard to the price of candles, tallow, in 1531, was 6 s
Scots, or 1 s and 11 d Sterling per Stone.  With respect to beef and
mutton, a mart ox was valued, in the Bishop of Aberdeen's rental,
at L. 1:  10 Scots, or 4 s and 6 d Sterling; equal to the converted
price of 3 bolls of oat meal.  This, no doubt was very cheap; but
the beef was probably indifferent.  A sheep in 1507, at the highest,
sold in Aberdeen for 2 s and 8 d Scotts, or 1 s and 3 d Sterling.  In
1576 it was converted for 5 s Scots or 9 d Sterling Only 40 years
ago, the farmers in this district sold an old ox, at the end of harvest,
for a guinez, or 25 s, and never above 30 s.  Little meat was there
usedn in Aberdeen, compared with what is made use of at present,
there was little demand from England, and no turnips, at least in
this district, for feeding old oxen.
