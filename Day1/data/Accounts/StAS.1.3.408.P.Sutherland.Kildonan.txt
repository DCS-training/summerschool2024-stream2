   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 1433
souls.  In April 1791, the population amounted to 1365, of
whom 244 were men, 295 women, 756 children, and 70
servants.  The number of births, from 4th June 1790, to

only 2 old men, the one 80, and the other 96 years of age.

   Cattle and Provisions.-The number of horses, in April 1791,
were computed at 812; cows, 2479; sheep, 5041; and goats,
570.  For these different kinds of cattle, of late years, good
prices have been got at the markets.  Horses, of the best
kind, draw from 4 L. to 6 L. Sterling; cows, from 50 s. to 4 L.
10 s.; sheep and wedders, from 4 s. to 6 s.; goats with kid,
5 s.; yell goats, from 3s. to 4s.; avers, i.e. gelded he.
goats, from 5 s. 6 d. to 6 s. 6 d.; lambs, in mid-summer, af-
ter being taken from their dams, draw, in the Caithness
markets, and at Dornock, from 2 s. to 3 s. Sterling.  The
produce of cattle has lately risen considerably in value.  A
stone of butter or tallow, which sold, about 10 years ago, at
8 s. now draws from 9 s. 6 d. to 12 s. Sterling.  Cow's milk
cheese, formerly 2 s. 6 d. and 3 s. is now sold at 4 s. and 4 s.
6 d. Sterling; and goats ditto, at 5 s. per stone.

setters, but none of them reside in the parish.  The rental
is only 400 L.  Sterling, consisting of money and teind victual,
which was converted at 10 s. per boll last Martinmas.
