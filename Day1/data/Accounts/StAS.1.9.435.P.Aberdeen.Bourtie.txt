the higher parts are neglected.  The ground upon the
skirts, and at the bottom of these hills, is wet and spungy;
later in harvest by 10 days than the earliest parts of the pa-
rish, and seems more suited for grass than grain.  The
lands lying to the W. and to the E. of these hills are gene-
rally of a strong stiff soil, with a clay bottom, pretty fertile,
but much pestered with large stones, both above and be-
low the surface.  About 20 years ago, our country did not
breed cattle of sufficient bulk and strength to labour the
ground.  They were mostly brought from the south, par-
ticularly from Fifeshire.  In a few years, by hard labour,
they were worn out, and became unfit for service; and as
the farmer had not the means of fattening them, he very
often sold them for a thid part of what they cost him.
The case is now much altered to the better.  The farmer
brings up oxen able for his work, sells them or fattens
them when they begin to be upon the decline, and in this
way is rather a considerable gainer than a loser upon his
work cattle.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the po-
pulation was then 525.  The number of inhabitants, by
an exact list in 1771, was 560.  It is now only 450; the de-
crease is principally owing to the monopoly of farms, and
the scarcity of moss.  Of the present inhabitants, 2 are
Seceders, 10 Episcopalians, and 6 Quakers, the rest attend
the Established Church.

   Rents.-One farmer possesses nearly what employed 4;
each of whom yoked 10 oxen.  The proprietor took these
lands under his own management for a few years, inclosed
and limed a considerable part of the grounds, built an ex-
cellent dwelling-house, substantial and commodious office-
