Lord President of tho Court of Session, the Court then consist-
inq of churchmen as well as laymen: he is unhappily stigmatized
by Robertson as the most corrupt man of his age.
  The Rev. John Wermyss, who was admitted to the parish in 1590,
became Principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, in 1592.
  The Rev. John Fleming, D.D. author of the " Philosophy
of Zoology," and of the " History of British Animals," and now
Professor of Natural Philosophy in King's College Aberdeen,
held this incumbency from 1811 to 1832.
  Land-owners.-The chief land-owners, with the extent of their
properties, are as follows:-Lord Dundas now (1838) created
Earl of Orkney, 1808 acres; Joseph Murray, Esq. of Ayton, 460
acres; John Whyte Melville, Esq. of Mount Melville, 218 acres.
The preceding includes, with the exception of 20 or 30 acres, the
whole property of the parish.
  Parochial Registers.-The register of baptisms and marriages,
combining also the accounts of disbursements, and the minutes of
session, commence 6th May 1697; and that of deaths and burials
1st March 1775.  They seem in general to have been kept with
care and regularity; the only marked omission being in that of the
session minutes from 1799 to 1822. It appears from these re-
cords, that the session, till at least nearly the middle of last cen-
tury, often held meetings for prayer; and administered discipline
by private or public rebukes for profaneness, desecration of the
Sabbath, drunkenness, quarrelling, and intemperate or opprobrious
language, as well as for violations of the seventh commandment.
  The following extracts are also worthy of insertion, as shewing,
inter alia, the interest taken by the church, both in the welfare of
individuals and in public objects.  The sums are given in old Scotch
money, 1701, May 18.  This day read from the pulpit, the Acts of
Assembly and Parliament against profaneness, and the Act of As-
