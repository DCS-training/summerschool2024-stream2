     General Appendix to

IN compliance with the Society's request of last June, (1773,)
I have employed some time in examining, as far as in me
lay, the present condition of the parish of Kilronan, in the
County of Rosscommon, and the adjoining* district; being
employed there this summer, in the improvement of a tract
thereof, which I have taken to farm last year.

   1st query.  The face of the arable part of this parish is hilly;
the intervening vallies, in some parts a very rich soil, in
others, turbarry.  The soil of the hills lying south of Bra-
liave mountain, having mostly a sole of limestone rock, and
a surface of kind earth, produces sweet herbage and good
crops of oats, though the tillage is indifferent.
   The hills eastward of Cross-Hill, and extending from the
river Feorus, to the stream dividing the counties of Leitrim
and Rosscommon, are composed, in general, of a brittle, fri-
able, brownish earth, on the surface.  As they approach the
river Shannon, and the lake, they have a bottom, in some
parts, of good manuring limestone gravel.  As they ascend
up the sides of the mountains, the soil of the surface remains
the same colour and quality, about 16 inches deep, and the
bottom a rotten slate, through which the water siltrates im-
mediately, and by which the soil up the mountain remains
remarkably dry, producing a short and sapless grass, but nei-
ther coarse nor spiry.
   The parish of Kilronan is bounded on the east by the
Shannon and Lough Allen; on the north, by the stream di-
viding the counties of Leitrim and Rosscommon; and mostly
on the south and west by the river Feorus.

*When I mention the word district, I mean the whole country sur-
rounding the lake.
