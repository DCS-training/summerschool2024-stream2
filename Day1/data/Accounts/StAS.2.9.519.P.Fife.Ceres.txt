              Mineralogy.-This parish abounds in minerals. Both coal and
	limestone are found; and regularly worked in several of the adjoining
	parishes, i. e. Cults, Largo, and St Andrews; and along the whole
	southmost part of this'parish, there are appearances both of coal and
	limestone. There is no coal woiked now from the this has arisen from
	the expense of the working, and not from the want of coals. The
	Teasses coals can be traced over a considerable distance of coun-
	try. A line might be traced from Teasses, by Hall Teasses,
	Newbigging, Craighall, and Craighall to Coaltown. About Hall-
	Teasses, the coal is described as very fine, and as gradually becom-
	ing blind and deprived of its bitumen. There are numerous old
	pits between Hall-Teasses and New Guilston. At Craighall
	Castle, the coal is separated from the limestone by a mass of trap,
	which has the effect of tilting the coals and adjoining strata upon
	edge. This tilting up of the strata into an almost vertical position,
	has brought into notice no less than seventeen seams of coal within
	a space of 500 yards. There are, in like manner, seventeen seams
	of coal as near the limestone at Pittenweem. They resemble the
	above, and are named the Ceres coals; and their individual names
	and thickness, along with the interposing strata, may give an in-
	teresting view of the curious alternations that take place in the
	formation of coal.
