session.  These, altogether, for many years past, were rented
at 3 L.  Last year they were feued at 40 L. the acre.  In like
manner in 1754, when there were only two churches on the
establishment for public worship, the seat rents of that por-
tion of them, which was the Town's, properly amounted to no
more than 21 L.4s. 7 d.  Now, when there are 7 established
churches and chapels, the seat rents of the same portion

   Besides the general advantages derived from the constitu-
tion of the British government, and the liberty and security
its subjects enjoy, in all their lawful occupations, the particu-
lar cause of the increase and prosperity of Dundee is, un-

ported without the bounty, or whether the spirit of industry,
which is now awakened, could be easily and profitably di-
verted into other channels, is a question on which it would
be presumptuous in any private person to pronounce, and,
perhaps, any experiment on the subject might be dangerous.
