march, at the south-west extremity, and which may consist of
about 300 acres, the form of this parish is nearly square, whose
side is 6 1/2 miles.  The river of Ayr, running from east to
west, divides this square into two parts; the one on the north
side being somewhat larger than that on the south.  This
river, which rises in the adjoining parish of Muirkirk, be-
ing, a little before its entrance into this parish, increased by
the Greenock and Garpel rivulets, and, in its progress thro
it, still further augmented by a number of smaller streams,
from both sides, forms, by the time it arrives at the western
boundary, a considerable body of water; which, during its
whole courie, runs with great rapidity on a bed of round
stones and gravel.  It frequently attempts to shift its bed,
and to make encroachments on the adjacent holms.  A
gentleman, who has paid much attention to rivers, characte-
rises it as the greatest tyrant of the kind he has ever known.
Its banks are almost every where steep and bold, and cloth-
ed with natural wood on one side or other, and very fre-
quently on both.  the scenery on its banks, therefore, espe-
cially about Sorn Castle and the manse, is, in an uncommon
degree, picturesque and pleasing.

   The land, observing the same course as the river, is high-
est on the east-side, and descends gradually towards the west;
diversified, however, by various inequalities on its surface.
The only considerable hill is Blackside-end, situated in the
north-east corner of the parish; the height of which above
the level of the sea is from 1500 to 1600 feet:  It is the be-
ginning of a ridge, which, with occasional interruptions,
sweeps a great way towards the east and south.  It com-
mands a prospect of almost the whole extensive county of
Ayr; the high lands of Galloway on the south; the Irish
Channel, the rock of Ailfa, the isles of Arran and Bute, on
