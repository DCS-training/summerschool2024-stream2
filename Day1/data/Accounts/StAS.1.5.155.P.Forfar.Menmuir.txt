for which purpose L. 30 was obtained from the country, and
L. 40 raised by subscription.  There are 5 corn mills on
Cruick water, and a fulling mill on a small rivulet to the
north.  At one of these mills about 400 bolls of pot-bar-
ley are annually made for the London market.  There is
only 1 licensed ale-house in the parish, and it is rather a
convenience than a nuisance.  Cottagers are here almost u-
niversally employed in labour.  Several farmers think that
they are both cheaper and more steady labourers than hired
servants.  Many of the cottagers live very comfortably.
