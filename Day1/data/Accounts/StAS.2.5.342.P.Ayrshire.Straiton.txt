	    	       V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	The market frequented by the parishioners is Ayr, fourteen miles
distant from the village, and twenty-six from the farthest farm-house.
The villages are Straiton and Patna. Straiton was mostly rebuilt
seventy years ago, and contains 330 inhabitants. Patna has been
wholly built within the present century, and contains 220 inbabi-
tants. It is on the banks of the Doon, distant from Straiton by the
public road seven miles, and by the moor, which walkers and riders
only can cross, and which is almost impassable in winter, four miles
and a-half.
	A penny-post office under Maybole was established five years
ago at Straiton. The length of turnpike roads running through
the parish is twenty-three miles. There are ten stone bridges with-
in the parish or on its borders, and two wooden bridges designed
for carriages, besides four for foot-passengers. A coach was run
from Ayr to Newton-Stewart, through Straiton, about fourteen
years, for a short time, but was found unprofitable. In 1832, a
coach ran for a few months between Straiton and Ayr. At Keirs
bridge, four and a-half miles from Straiton, or at Dalmellington,
six and a-half miles distant, the coach running between Ayr and
Dumfries may be got.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The church is a very plain building, some
centuries old, which was altered and repaired in 1787, and again
in 1813. Attached to it is an aisle of Gothic architecture, which
is believed to have been a part of the ancient church before the
Reformation, and is now the private gallery of Sir David Hunter
