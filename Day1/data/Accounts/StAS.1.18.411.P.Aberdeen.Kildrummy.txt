     Geography and Natural History.

   THE annals of the 12th century mention this parish by
its present name, which is pure Celtic, though a little
differently enunciated in that tongue.  It signifies the little
Burial Mount.  It is situated on the banks of the Don, about
40 English miles from its mouth near Aberdeen, and about
20 from its sources, in the mountains of Curgarff.  It is un-
equally divided by the river, which the people commonly
pass upon stilts; which are poles or stakes, about 6 feet in
length, with a step on one side, on which the passenger
raised about 2 feet from the ground, resting them against
his sides and armpits, and moving them forward by each
hand, totters through.  This shows the river is not navigable.
It is however moderately stocked with the two kinds of trout,
common to all the smaller rivers on the eastern side of the
kingdom.
   The parish separated from its neighbours, on every side by
pretty high hills, may be considered as a level valley, from 2
