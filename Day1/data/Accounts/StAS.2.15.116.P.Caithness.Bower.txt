                tenant, with the mains enlarged, and a new square of offices, and
                thrashing-mill driven by horses.
                   The estate of Thura was, within the last forty years, purchas-
                ed by the late William Sinclair, Esq. of Freswick. It is now the
                property of his son. The Mains have been lately improved by
                drains and extended enclosures.
                   Among the improvements in this parish, those carried on by
                John Sinclair of Barrack, on the property of Lyth and Alterwall,
                may be reckoned the greatest. He has added several hundred
                acres to the land in his own possession, laid much ground dry,
                multiplied enclosures, and on some of the pastures for sheep added
                wire fences, besides erecting a new mansion-house, and squares of
                farm-steadings.
