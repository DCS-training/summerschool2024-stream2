   Salubrity of the Climate, Health of the People, Longevity,
etc.-From the above observations on the soil and climate,
a person would be apt to conclude, that they must be ini-

which detract from the comforts of life, and confine it to a
very contracted period; more especially when the extra-

who exceeded 80, and at present there are a score who are
either 90, or on the confines of that period, and most of
them perfectly found both in body and mind.  Here I
