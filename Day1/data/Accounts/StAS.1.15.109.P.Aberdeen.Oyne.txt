heel.  The stocking manufacture brings in from
300 L. to 400 L. a year, according to the price of stockings,
which varies.

   Fuel.-The fuel is peats and turfs from Benochie.-There
are 4 or 5 parishes which get their fuel from this high moun-
tain.  Men and horses are employed at least 2 months in
summer in providing this fuel.  It is wished the canal may take
place, and then all these inconveniences will be obviated.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The stipend was formerly 3
chalders of meal, 1 of bear, and 32 L. 15 s. in money.  An aug-
mentation was obtained two months ago, (March 1794:)
The manse was built in 1717; but there is no record of the
time when the church was built.  Both are nearly in a ruinous
state.  Colonel Knight of Pittodry is patron.-There is only
one school in the parish.  The school-master's salary is 11 L.
2 s. 6; but he has neither house nor garden belonging to the
office,-There are at present on the poor's roll 9 families, who
get regular, but scanty supplies.  There are no funds but 20 L.
Sterling; the interest of this sum, and the collections in the
church, throughout the year, will not exceed 7 L. 10 s.

   Character and Antiquities.-The people, in general, are re-
gular anti industrious, and mostly employed in farming.
There is not one ale-house in the parish.-The only antiqui-
ties in this district are two Druidical temples.
