   Fish, Shipping, etc.-The fish caught here have of late
years been in much smaller number than formerly.
Quantities are sometimes sent to the Edinburgh market.
Within these few months, a plan was formed for catching
turbot with nets, and so getting them alive to tend up to
London; but the trials have not been as yet very success-
ful.  A considerable quantity of lobsters are caught here
and in the neighbourhood, and sent to London.-The people
here re generally fond of a seafaring life, but few have
entered the navy as volunteers.  They in general discover

or 3 from the parish have inlifted during the last 30 years.
At present the number of boats is only 5, and of vessels 4.
From a record of the town, it appears that prior to 1639,

13 fail of large vessels; all of which were either taken by
the enemy, wrecked, or sold in consequence of the death
of the commanders and marines at the battle of Kilfyth.

   Coal, etc.-The whole surface of the parish is supposed
to cover a continued field of coal, which lies in a very ex-
traordinary way, first taking one direction, then a contrary
one, with different dipps.  The property of it belongs to
Sir John Anstruther.  When it began to be wrought is
uncertain.  It is believed to have been wrought by Oliver
Cromwell, who took possession of the Earl of Kelly's estate,
of which it then formed a part; and a pit is still to be seen,
that goes by the name of Cromwell's pit.  In past times,
as much coal was taken out as could be procured without
