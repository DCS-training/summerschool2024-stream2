   Pickling Seed Wheat.-All the wheat for feed undergoes
a preparation, which here they call pickling, i. e. they
sprinkle it with stale urine, and then riddle powdered quick-
lime upon it, turning it all the time with shovels, until the
grain be completely covered with a white crust.  It is then
carried out to the field, and sown immediately.  This has
been an established practice for many years, and it is fol-
lowed, from experience of its utility.  It is very probable
that it serves to quicken vegetation, and to prevent vermin
from destroying the feed.  it is also a good practice to
swim the feed in a strong brine, or pickle, of sea salt, made
strong enough to bear an egg, to take off all the light grain,
which swims on the surface, and then lime the rest for
feed.

   Smut in Wheat.-The operation of pickling has been sup-
posed an effectual remedy against smut (blake) in wheat;
but it certainly is not so.  Whatever may be the cause of
this disease is difficult to say; but it is by no means pecu-
liar to wheat; it is very remarkable in barley, and also in
oats; but amongst them it quite disappears in the threshing,
and therefore is not noticed.  Sound ears have been found,
to all appearance from the same root, and even some sound
grains of wheat upon the same ear with smut.  Some have
thought it was an insect, and that it was infectious, and if
sown with other seed would produce smutty corn:  this is
not true, for the experiment has been fairly tried here, of
smutty and sound wheat mixed, and even some of the smut
bruised, and the crop did not differ in any respect from the
rest of the field.  It may be in some respects from the sea-
son, and in some from the feed; perhaps from some imper-
fection in the maturation of particular grains, totally im-
perceptible to us, the causes of which we are ignorant of, and
which may never be in the power of man to remedy.  The
