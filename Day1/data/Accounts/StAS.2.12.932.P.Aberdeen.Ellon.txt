represents physical and even moral changes as abstracted from all
but secondary causes, and thus, by excluding, or, at least, failing
to recognize, the agency of that only living and vivifying power,
which Hath impressed on the worlds, both of mind and matter,
their respective laws, builds up, imperceptibly indeed, but not
therefore with less fatal success, the impious superstructure of a
cold, earthly, and sensuous philosophy.  In the course of reading
now adverted to, which has obviously no tendency to stir up those
deep and mysterious sympathies of the heart which make man
conscious of his spiritual relationship, and impart to him the first
taste of living wisdom,-the exercise of the merely intellectual
powers of pupils will serve only to aggravate the evil, as the
knowledge to be derived from such a source is that knowledge
destitute of charity, which the Scriptures emphatically designate
as the knowledge that puffeth up.  It is admitted that an educa-
tion so conducted may be attended, if we regard it in a merely
temporal point of view, with considerable advantages.  The know-
ledge which it supplies may extend commerce, improve manufac-
tures, and furnish to the blind votary of wealth the accomplish-
ments requisite for success in his pursuit.  But it is not less true,
on the other hand, that both the principles on which such an edu-
cation is based, and the spirit which it breathes, stand diametrical-
ly opposed to the spirit and principles of the word of God, tend-
ing to efface from the mind all practical remembrance of Divine
truth, and to make the heart hard as steel against every nobler
affection and sympathy of our nature.
   Where, then, in the business of education, the school-books
conjoined with the Bible are of the character above described,
the salutary impressions which the scriptural morning lesson might
make on the minds of pupils will be almost necessarily obliterated
by the uncongenial course of study, which forms the occupation
of the subsequent part of the day.  In such circumstances, the
Bible lesson will be an isolated task, from which, impelled by the
natural aversion of the carnal mind to spiritual things, the scholar
will gladly make his escape to studies that, from their being con-
versant with sensible objects, from their supplying at less expense
of thought, a less valuable, yet a more tangible and showy
knowledge; and, above all, from their promising to promote more
directly his views in life, he will regard with feelings of a livelier
interest.  In an education so conducted, although the religious
instruction of his pupils shall be carefully attended to on the part
