slax, and as there is a great deal of wool annually ex-
ported, it is to be presumed, that the manufacture of
woollen and linen cloth would be attended with the
greatest success.  There are likewise some good situa-
tions for bleachfields.

   There is one disadvantage which this county in gene-
ral labours under, and that is, the want of moss roads.
The mosses, for the most part, lie at the distance of 2 or
3 miles from the tenants, and over almost inaccessible
hills; by which means they are obliged to carry home
their fuel on horseback.  This makes them keep a 
greater number of horses than their farms can well
bear; consequently the horses are of a small size: but
were proper roads to be made, the tenants in general
would keep larger horses and sewer of them, and would
provide wheel carriages.  This is clearly evinced upon
the estate of Monaltry.  The present proprietor, mere-
ly to accommodate his tenants, a very complete road to
an inexhaustible moss.  It is carried over the summit 
of a high hill, yet so well directed, that the acclivity
is scarcely felt: the expense, no doubt, was considerable;
but the consequence is, that since that period most of 
the tenants have provided themselves with carts, and, 
in a few years hence, it is very probable, the whole
tenants on the estate will do the same.

   Another disadvantage, which prevails in some places
of the country, is the personal services of the tenants.
Wherever the tenants are expected to thrive, personal
services should be dispensed with and commuted.  That
which has longest kept up, is the poviding a certain
quantity of fuel for the master, yearly, with some long
