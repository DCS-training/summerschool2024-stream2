farthest from the coast, the depopulation of that barony
was completed before the close of the last century.
   2. Another cause, affecting all the other estates in the pa-
rish, is the change that has taken place since the rebellion,
1745, in the size and number of farms.  Formerly they
were very small and numerous, running from 4 to 16 bolls
of rent; new they are larger, and not half so numerous as
they were.  A multiple of small farms is very favourable
to population; yet the enlargement of farms, to a certain
degree, was needful in this parish, where the grounds so
much needed rest, and where milk, butter, and butcher-
meat were so scarce; and, had there been manufactures
sufficient to employ the hands superseded from tillage, the
enlargement of farms might have been favourable to agri-
culture, without diminishing the population.  But this not
being the case,
   3. The neglect of manufactures may be stated as a third
cause, and the greatest of any, affecting the population of this
parish.  The present possessors, finding that there are not
so many rooms as formerly for farmers, breed their chil-
dren to handicrafts; and these, not finding employment at
home, push their way to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paisley, or
London, from whence they seldom find their way back to
settle here.  This cause affects most of the northern districts,
where manufactures do not meet with the attention and en-
couragement that they deserve.  This is what occasions
yearly emigrations, during the seasons of summer and har-
vest work, to places where there is more employment and
higher wages; and these short excursions frequently end in
a removal to manufacturing towns at the last.

   Remedies.-The remedies are pointed out by the causes
of emigration, or decrease of people.
