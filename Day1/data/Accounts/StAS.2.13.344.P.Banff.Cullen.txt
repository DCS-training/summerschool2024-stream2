          tensive as the royalty, extend from the water-mouth of Cullen,

          Logie road; thence, in a straight line to the point at which the
          Banff and Keith roads meet; thence, to the point at which the
          Seafield and Slacks roads meet; and thence to the bridge over
          the water of Cullen, the boundary terminating at the water-
          mouth.  Municipal constituency, 38.  Annual revenue from L.70
