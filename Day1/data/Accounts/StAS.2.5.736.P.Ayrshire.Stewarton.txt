	Breed and Quantity of Live-Stock.--Milch cows of the Ayr-
shire breed form the chief class of the cattle. The account of
the stock, as described below, was taken several years ago. The
stock of milch cows and sheep have greatly increased since, owing
to the ready sale and comparatively high prices obtained for dairy
produce.

	Husbandry.--The lands being in the natural possession of con-
siderably more than the majority of the heritors, the farm-buildings
and enclosures, as already stated, are good. Leases vary as to
endurance, according to the pleasure of the parties.
	Improvements.--By far the best system of cultivation practised
here, was introduced and is still carried on by Mr Cuninghame of
Lainshaw, the largest heritor, whose property extends to 2600
acres and upwards. He retains in his own hands nearly 300 acres
under the best management, equal to the best cultivated spots in
England. This gentleman is well known as a writer on the sub-
ject of our Saviour's personal Reign, Sacred Chronology, &c.
	Manufactures.--There are about 300 weavers employed in
cotton and silk fabrics, and not a few in customary work, such as
shirtings, sheeting, tablecloths, towelling, blankets, druggets, &c.
&c. The manufacture most famed is that of bonnets, and it is of
a very long standing. Almost the whole regimental and naval
bonnets and caps are made here, as well as those worn by
the people in the country at large. Upwards of fifty families,
besides a very great number of boys and girls, are thus em-
ployed. Their deacon was styled, "Princeps Pileorum Arti-
fex Scotice." Steel clockwork is peculiar to this place, and is in
great demand, not only in Britain but in America. There is a
