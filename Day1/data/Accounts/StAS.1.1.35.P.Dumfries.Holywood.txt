place so called is the field where the Druidical temple above

   Eminent Men Natives of the Parish.-Hollywood has pro-
duced no men of eminence in learning or science, except Mr.
Charles Irvine surgeon.  He was a younger son of the late
William Irvine of Gribton, Esq; and the person who, several
years ago, discovered the method of rendering salt water fresh,
for which he was rewarded by government with a grant of
five thousand pounds.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The harvests of 1782, and
1783, were very late, especially that of 1782.  Before the
corn was all cut in this part of the country, there were in-
tense frosts and heavy snows.  On the 2 d of November 1782,
in particular, a very heavy fall of snow covered the corn so
deep, and lay so long, that they could not be cut for several
days after.  Though the harvest was uncommonly late in
this parish in these two years, and though the latest of the
corn in it was hurt by the frost, yet the harvest here was
earlier than in any other part of Scotland; and the greatest
part of the corn was ripened before the frost came on.  Under
all these untoward circumstances, the crops of these years were,
however, uncommonly good, as is the cafe, not only this year,
but also in all late years, owing to the peculiar dryness and ear-
liness of the soil and elimate of this parish.  The general scarcity
of meal in Scotland during these two years, and the great de-
mand for seed corn from those counties where the frosts had
destroyed the crops, greatly increased, as is well remembered,
the price of meal and oats all over Scotland.  At that time
the farmers os this parish had large quantities of both, espe-
cially of seed corn, to sell; and they cleared by it in those
two years, more than they ever did in any other two years.
