Husbandry.--There is a considerable diversity of sohl in this pa-
rish.  Upon the banks of the Almond, it is a sandy loam; in the
neigbbourhood of Pertb, it becomes stronger, and approaches to clay;
on the higher grounds, it is light and thin, on a gravelly bottom;
towards the west, there is some deep dry black land, of an excel-
lent quality; but the greater proportion is on a tilly subsoil, which
renders it naturally damp. Our farmers are all men of capital
and intelligence, and in general manage their farms according to
the most approved modern systems.  Draining has already been
carried to a great extent on the wet soils and is still going on
with great vigour.  Turnip husbandry is universally followed on
those soils which are fit for it; and the practice of resting the
land, by allowing it to be two or three years in pasture, is now be-
come very general.  By these means the average produce is great-
ly above what it was twenty years ago.  The gross value, as nearly
as can be ascertained, is as follows:-

  Manufactories.-As early as 1774, Huptingtowerfield was form-
ed for the purpose of bleaching linen cloth.  This work was car,
ried oui with great spirit and success for forty years, by Messrs
Richardson and Co., when it was let by the present proprietors,
Sir John Richardson of Pitfour, and Robert Smythe, Esq. of
Metheven, to Messrs William Turnbull and Son. Under the
energy and activity of the present lease-holder, the work has now
become one of the first in Scotland.  At present about 40 Scotch
acres are covered with cloth. The quantity whitened annually is
about a million a-half of yards, besides from 80 to 100 tons of
linen yarn, for a power-loom factory in the neighbourbood.  The
number of peooe employed is about 150, of whom nearlyane-third
are women and boys.
   Immediately below this work, on the same Lead, are the flour
and barley-mills, the property of Mr Turnbull, the tacksman of the
bleachfield, at which a considerable amount of business is done.
