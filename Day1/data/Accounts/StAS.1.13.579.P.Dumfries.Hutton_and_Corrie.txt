   Names.-The names of farms and places in these parishes
are of the present English language, with very few excep-
tions.  The lowest, or most southern farm of the parish on
the side of Milk, is called Balstack, evidently from the 
Gaelic, and probably means the Town of large old Trees.
Others, without any known signification, as Mackmaw,
seem of Gaelic sound.  Some names of the hills are so also,
as Carthur, Scoup, Talmeilloch*.

   Bests and Birds.-The wild quadrupeds are foxes, hares,
polecats and weasels.  The last generation remembered
roes in the woods of Dryfe.  Otters half a century ago
were frequent.  They are now very rare.  Game are moor-
fowl and partridge; heath hens are seen, but no black-
cock.  These hens are supposed to come from the parish
of Johnstone.  Wild geese in winter.  Wild ducks, plover,
and lapwing: The last was very numerous 40 years since.
They are now, it is reckoned, not one for a hundred.
Singing birds abound particularly on Dryfe, as the thrush,
blackbird, goldsinch, linnets of all kinds, etc.  There is a

riding between Jedburgh and Dumfries, he came the road by the tower
of Gillesbie, and accidentally heard a voice call a dog, Battie! Battie!
in the same manner and tone he was acquainted with when in the tower.
This was soon after the institution of the Court of Session.

*The names of waters here, as is generally the case, seem lost in an-
tiquity.  Dryfe, in the 12th century, in the charter by David Prince of
Cumberland to the Bishop of Glasgow, is called Drive, and Drivesdale
This, as well as Milk, has no known derivation.  Corrie only retains a
name unswerable to the present meaning of the word as before mentioned.
There are several terminations in Cleugh, as Cowancleugh, Wynholm-
cleugh, etc.  This is also a Gaelic word, and answers to a cat in the
earth.  Every cleugh is a cut by the water.
