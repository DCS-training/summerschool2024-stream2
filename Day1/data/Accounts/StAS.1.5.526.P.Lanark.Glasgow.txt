     Statistical Account

   Those, who incline, may become members of more than
one society, and when they are in distress, they receive
the stipulated support from each; so that a person, who
chuses to spare a little money, in the time of health, has
the pleasure of seeing plenty in his family, when he is no
longer able to provide for them.  These societies seem to
be the best support, for the relief of the work people in a
manufacturing country, as it makes them look forward in
time of health and prosperity, to the calamities and mis-
fortunes which are so incident to human life; and by ap-
propriating a part of their earnings, which they can then
easily spare, affords them the satisfaction of knowing they
will be supported, when reduced by sickness or old age, to
be unable to work for themselves, without the humiliating
necessity of supplicating the charity of the benevolent, or
being a burden on their friends.- Besides, this method of
support is no bar to industry, which many of the charita-
ble institutions of this country has been reproached with,
as it holds up no certain substistence for the idle or the
profligate; and by supporting the industrious tradesmen in
the midst of his family does not loosen the bands of natu-
ral affection, of take him out of the world, and the so-
ciety to which he has been accustomed*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It is impossible, in a work of this nature, to give a particular ac-
count of the numerous societies of this kind, of the rules by which they
are governed, which differ according to circumtances; and though con-
siderable pains has been taken, to procure information of the sums which
are in this manner expended annually, yet, from unvoidable circum-
stances, it has been impossible to get it correct, and therefore we can on-
ly give the names and sums of such as have come to our knowledge.
