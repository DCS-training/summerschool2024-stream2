     of Kilmartin.

from the best information that can be got, the lower, or S. W.
end of the parish, the principal arable part of it (being nearly
one half of the valued rent, and two-fifths of the real), may
sow 540 bolls white oats, and 80 bolls bear:  The produce does
not exceed 3 1/2 seeds of oats; and in bear, generally about 5 1/2 or
6 returns.  The boll of oats fells, at from 15s. to 17s., accord-
ing to the quality; the bear, from 20s. to 22 s.  The mea-
sure, is reckoned larger, by nearly 2 pecks, than the Linlithgow
boll.  There are considerable crops of potatoes, not that the
increase is great, but large quantities being planted, some in
the drilled way, the boll of them generally sells, from 5 s. to
6 s., in autumn and winter.  There is no regular measure for
them, 3 barrels (herring gauge), being reckoned nearly a
boll.  When they fail, the tenants are much at a loss, being
under the necessity of using, for the support of their families,
the victual that was designed for the rent.

   Farms.-The rent of arable farms, according to their quality
and extent, may be from 40 L. to 80 L.  They are possessed, the
smaller farms by 4, and the larger by 6, and some times 8 tenants.
The flock or holding of these farms, may be, from 24 to 48
cows, besides some young cattle; from 30 to 60 sheep; and
from 8 to 12 horses, according to their different extents.  The
lowing is much in the same proportion; oats, from 20 to 45
bolls; bear, from 3 to 6 bolls.  What is called bear here, is
greatly inferior to the Low Country barley.  It would be
the interest of the tenant to reduce his stock at least a fourth,
as, by the present management, there is neither milk nor rear-
ing in proportion to the number of cattle.  When young,
they are at short allowance as to milk, and pinched in grass
when further advanced; so that few of them turn out to be
good cattle.  This holds good, however, only with regard to
the cattle of the small tenants.
