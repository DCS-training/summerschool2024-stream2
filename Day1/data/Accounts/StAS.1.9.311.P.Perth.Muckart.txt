inhabitants are supplied with coal from the coal pits in the
neighbourhood at Blairngone and Dollar.

   Roads and Bridges.-Two roads run through the parish;
the one from Kinross to Stirling; the other from Queen's
Ferry to Strathern, by Blairngone; and there are, besides
the Rumbling Bridge formerly mentioned, other three
bridges over the Dovan, between the parishes of Muckart
and Fossaway; one on the road near the old manse of Fos-
saway; one on the road from Kinross to Stirling; and one
on the road from Queen's Ferry to Strathern, a little north
from Blairngone.  As this last is a very public road, it is
of great importance that it be made as easy for travellers
and carriages as possible.  Accordingly, an act of Parlia-
ment hath lately been obtained for making it a turnpike
road, that it may be put and kept in proper repair, which,
when done, must be of great advantage to the public.
