thy proprietor, having for the few last years of his life, re-
sided in the country, carrying on improvements, and intend-
ing to direct the industry of the people in a new line, kept a
little stir of business agoing for a short time, which induced
a few strangers to settle in the parish; but the suspension of
there operations, in consequence of his-lamented death in
1790, has again affected the population so far, that much
cannot now be attributed to this circumstance.  The chief
cause is, that the principal tacksmen have almost doubled the
number of their subtenants in the creeks on the eastern shore,
where the poor people are desirous to settle for the conveni-
ence and advantage of fishing sythe and cuddy.  Having no
access to salt under the present slate of the salt laws, these
are almost the only kinds of fish among the numerous species
on the coast, which they are encouraged to look after; and
of these, fortunately for them under such a severe operation
of law, they can procure, with little labour, a fresh supply
to their families, generally every morning and evening.
   The number of birth and marriages in 1792, is considerably
below the average of former years; but the number of deaths
is extraordinary.  There was a bad kind of the small-pox,
which carried off a number of the children, almost all ino-
culated by their parents, without medical assistance, a plan
which was found to have answered, at former periods, with-
out any fatal consequence: Besides this, the people were vi-
sited by a pestilential fever, with which every soul in a fami-
ly once infected was laid up; and it generally proved fatal,
to old people.
   The climate as well as the occupation of the inhabitants
seems favourable to health.  In the summer months, when
the weather is fair, the air is most salubrious; but it is liable
to sudden changes, which may account for the diseases most
prevalent here, viz. coughs and rheumatisms.  This country
