winter season.  The upper part consists of very strong leather;
the under part, of soles of timber about an inch and a half
thick.  They are very cumbrous, but dry and warm, and rec-
koned very conducive to health.  They are common in many
parts of England, and cannot be too strongly recommended for
the use of the poor in Scotland, who find shoes a very expensive
article of dress, particularly in the remote parts of the country.

*Attention to the breeding of swine has, as yet, only pre-
vailed near the western borders of Scotland.  It is found so
advantageous, that it ought to be extended as much as possible
all over the kingdom.  It requires skill; but, where the proper
mode of managing swine is well known, from the quickness of
the return, they prove the most profitable stock of any.
