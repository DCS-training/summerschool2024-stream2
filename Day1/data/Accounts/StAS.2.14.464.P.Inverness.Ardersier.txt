ary last, when birds were said to have been found frozen to the branches
of trees in different parts of Scotland, the lowest temperature was
on the night of the 8th, when the thermometer fell to 10&deg;. During
that day its highest indication was 22&deg;. The lowest temperature
in March was on the 8th, 37&deg;; the highest on the 16th, 62&deg;.
Of the observations during the four following months, the result
is as follows :

   In the register from which the above is taken, it is remarked
that the ash trees before the manse were not so expanded in leaf
on the loth June 1840, as on the 28th May 1841 ; also that a
brood of fully fledged starlings was seen in the church-yard on the
5th June.
   Among the prognostics of the weather, there is one which is
pretty generally known, and very frequently correct. When the
Ross-shire hills are seen very distinctly in the morning, coming
rain is foretold; when a haze or dry mistiness renders these hills
or any distant object less distinct, a dry day is indicated. Darwin,
in his Zoonomia, somewhat fancifully explains this atmospheric
phenomenon on the principle, that the increase of transparency by
filling the pores with fluid, is seen by soaking white paper in oil,
which, from an opaque, becomes a transparent body.
   The atmosphere is dry and salubrious. As illustrating in some
measure the salubrity of the climate, we may mention the following
fact, for which we are indebted to the Rev. Mr Campbell of
Croy, to whom the parties were well known. About forty years
ago, there were living in the parish fourteen individuals, ten males,
and four females, whose respective ages at the time of their deaths,
(and the last of them lived till about six years ago,) were as follows:
one 106 years, one 104, one 103; these three were Chelsea
pensioners; one 100, two 98, one 96, two 94, one 92, two,
90, and two 88. The rains of spring and autumn readily percolate
through the shingly and porous subsoil which characterizes
the lower parts of the parish, between which and the higher part
there is a well-mhrked climatic difference. While the upper part
