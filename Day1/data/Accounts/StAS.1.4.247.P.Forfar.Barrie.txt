     of Barrie.

the farms can be reduced to no average measure.  The
upper division of the parish, which may be properly styled
the arable part, is parcelled out among 10 or 11 landhold-
ers, 3 of whom are proprietors.  Their farms contain re-
spectively from 30 to 300 acres a-piece.  A happy adjust-
ment of things has prevented a monopoly of farms, many
of the leases presently current having been granted before
the all-engrossing system began to extend its baneful influ-
ence.  It cannot be denied, however, that when any tack
happens to fall, this system discovers itself in miniature,
by a marked avidity to join to the former possession of a 
house and yard, the ground plot of a razed house, and the
extent of its attached yard.  Along with the mode of la-
bouring with horses, instead of oxen, the number of cotta-
gers in the service of the farmers has been diminished.
There is no planned design to depress cottages; but ser-
vants entertained in the house, are found more conveni-
ently placed for every exigence, are perhaps less expensive,
not less active, not less disinterested, than those who have
families of their own.  Besides 12 day-labourers, who have
merely houses and yards, the only class of men who fall
under the description of cottagers, are those employed by
the farmers for threshing the corns.  They receive as wages,
the twenty-fifth boll of each kind of grain they separate
from the straw with a dinner each working day.  The
plough of Small's construction, drawn generally by 4 horses,
and attended by a stout lad and a boy, appears well a-
dapted to every variety of soil in the parish.  In a small
parish, of which not a third part is arable land, the num-
ber of ploughs and carts in very inconfinderable.  One wag-
gon was made at Barrie in the year 1791.  No waggon-
road can reasonably be expected in the parish sooner than 
the year 1793.
