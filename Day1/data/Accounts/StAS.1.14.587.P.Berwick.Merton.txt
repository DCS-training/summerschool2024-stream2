and thriving plantations.  The soil towards the Tweed, par-
ticularly the haughs, is sharp, with a gravelly bottom;
towards the N., and indeed through the rest of the pa-
rish, with very few exceptions, it is a stiff clay, with a till
bottom.

   Improvements.-While other places have been advancing
in improvement, this parish has not been neglected.  About
40 years ago, the tenants were miserably lodged, the fields
open and exposed to every blast, and hardly a tree to be
seen, a few about the houses of the different proprietors
excepted.  Now the scene is agreeably changed; the te-
nants possess warm and comfortable houses, many of them
large, and most of them slated; the greater part of the
arable land is enclosed, and surrounded with belts and
clumps of plantation.  The estate of Mr. Scott of Harden
in particular, which comprises nearly two-thirds of the
whole, exhibits a greater extent of neat thriving hedges
and plantations, than perhaps is to be met with in the S.
of Scotland.

   Agriculture and Produce.-Previous to the year 1766,
the old Scotch plough only was used, and no manure
thought of but what the farms produced.  Since that pe-
riod, immense quantities of lime have been annually
driven from Lothian and England, at the great distance
of 26 miles.  It answers extremely well; and though each
cart, of 5 bolls, all expences included, costs 10 s. 6 d., the
farmer finds his account in using it.  Two horse ploughs
are generally used, and the most approved methods of hus-
bandry keenly followed.  The quantity of grain annually
sown, and the average return of each boll, is nearly as
follows:
