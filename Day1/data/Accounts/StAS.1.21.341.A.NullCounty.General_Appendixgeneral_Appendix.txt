citizens, who have liberal ideas and love their country, and
whose sentiments he knows to be the same with his own.
Nor does he presume to dilate the provision that ought to

lature, be turned to this subject, resources will not be wanting
for putting the parochial schoolmasters of Scotland on a foot-
ing as respectable in regard to emoluments, as their labours
are necessary and useful to the virtue and happiness both
of individuals, and of the community at large.
