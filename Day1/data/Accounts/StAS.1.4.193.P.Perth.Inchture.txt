   Heritor's, Rent, Culture, etc.-The heritors in this pa-
rish are 3 in number, one of whom only resides at present.
The valued rent is L. 593, 13 s. Sterling.  The real rent
may be about L. 6000 Sterling.  The number of acres of
arable land, 3000.  All the ground in this parish is ex-
ceeding rich, and well improven, chiefly by lime, which
suits best with a clay soil.  The farms in general are ex-
tensive, scarce one of them less than 100 acres, some of
them 200, and one about 300.  Farms, of late years, have
been let at 40 s. and 45 s. an acre; and 3 years ago, a
large farm, consisting of about 300 acres, above 50 s.  In
general, the rents are paid, part in victual, and part in mo-
ney.  The farmers here are wealthy, and live genteelly-
They send only 1 man and 2 horses to a plough.  Wages
to a good ploughman, are from L. 8 to L. 10 a-year; a day-
labourer gets 9 d. or 10 d. a-day, and his meat; in harvest,
1 s. a day, or L. 1, 1 s. for the whole harvest-work; a wo-
man gets 15 s. for harvest.  Womens wages are yearly
about L. 3.  There are but few manufacturers, the farm-
ers choosing rather to let their hourses to day-labourers.  A-
bout 40 or 50 years ago, oxen were much employed in
ploughing, but now horses only.  The parish is reckoned a-
bout 60 ploughs; but at particular seasons, nearly 80 are
employed.  The farms are generally divided into 6 parts,
wheat, barley, beans or pease, ots, clover-grass, and sal-
low.  Ground properly sallowed and limed, often pro-
duces 15 bolls of wheat the acre; the average produce of
whole farms is 10.  Threshing mills are of late a very
great improvement.  There are five of them in this parish.
One goes by water, and will thresh 30 bolls in an hour,
and also separtes the corn from the chaff.  The other
mills, which require 3 or  horses to drive them, can thresh
25 bolls in an hour.  A mill employs 6 or 7 men to feed
the mill, as they phrase it, carry off the straw, etc. and
