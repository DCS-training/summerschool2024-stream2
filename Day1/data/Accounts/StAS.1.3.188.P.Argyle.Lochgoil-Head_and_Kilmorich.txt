     Statistical Account

   Schools.-There are two schools in this district; a  paro-
chial school at Lochgoil-head, and a school at Cairndow,
supported by the Society for propagating Christian Know-
ledge.  The parichial schoolmaster teaches Latin, English,
Gaelic, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and
church-music; and the Society schoolmaster teaches all these
branches of education, except Latin.  The number of scholars
who attend the parochial school is about 40.  The number
who attend the Society school is usually about 60.  This
disparity in the number of the scholars, is owing to the dif-
ference of the roads leading to the schools.  Some of the
tacksmen employ young men to teach their children in their
own houses; and the tenants and cottagers, who live at a dis-
tance from the established schools, usually join in hiring a
teacher at their own expence, at least during the winter sea-
son.  The salary of the parochial and Society schoolmasters
is L, 10 Sterling each; and their other prequisites amount to
about L. 10 more.  It must be acknowledged, that L. 20s, is
too little for the decent and comfortable support of a school-
master, and too small an allowance for the great trouble and
importance of his charge.

   Inns.-There are two principal houses of entertainment in
this parish, one at Lochgoil-head, and the other at Cairn-
dow; they are both necessary for the accommodation of the pu-
blic, Cairndow being situated upon the line of the great western
military road, and the only stage between Arrochar and Inver-
aray; and Lochgoil-head being a much frequented pass, espe-
cially in summer, between the West Highlands and the Low
Country.  Besides these, there are two or three huts in the
parish, where spirits are occasionally sold.  These, however,
have no bad effects upon the morals of the inhabitants of 
this country.
