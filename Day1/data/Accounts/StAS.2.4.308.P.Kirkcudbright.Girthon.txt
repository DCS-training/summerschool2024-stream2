tholics are visited periodically by the priest who is settled at Dal-
beattie, in the parish of Urr, above twenty miles distant. The
stewartry of Kirkcudbright belongs to the diocese of the Bishop,
whose residence is in Edinburgh.
	The following is a list of the ministers of the parish of Gir-
thon from the Reformation to the present time, so far as their
names can now be ascertained: John Bonar, 1595-1596; Alex-
ander Prizel; John M'Lellan, 1638-1655; Simeon- Knox;*
William Erskine, 1659-1662; Robert Moir, 1690-1692; Wil-
liam Gammell 1693-1697; Patrick Johnston,+ 1699-1736
Robert Thomson, 1737-1758; Robert Cooper, 1759-1776;
John M'Naught, (deposed,) 1778-1793; William Thorburn,
(translated to Troqueer,) 1792-1801; Robert Gordon, 1801-
1817; Robert Jeffrey, (resigned,) 1818-1843; George Murray,
1843.
	Education.--The means of education are ample. The parish
school was improved subsequently to the retirement of Mr Arm-
strong, and is a large and commodious building. The schoolmas-
ter's house, which is not worthy of the parish, is immediately at-
tached to it, with a valuable garden immediately behind. The
salary is considerably higher than the maximum, owing to the li-
berality of Mr Murray. There are four schools in addition to the
parochial'one, of which three are unendowed; the fourth is a
charity school, supported by Lady Anne Murray of Broughton,
and in which not only education but clothes are given gratuitously.
According to an official return made to Government, (Educat.
Enquiry, Scotland, Parl. Paper, 1837, Vol. xlvii.) the number of
pupils at the parish school was 120; in the non-parochial schools,
144; total, 264, or about the seventh of the entire population,--
a proportion very unusual, and highly honourable to the character
of the parish. The proportions at the different seminaries have
since considerably changed, and the aggregate number of scholars
has rather increased than diminished. There is no need of addi-
tional schools. The inhabitants of the northern district of the
parish, indeed, labour under great disadvantages as to education,
owing to their distance from tin school. Nor is it likely that they
will ever enjoy greater facilities in this respect, owing to the ex-
treme thinness of population. It is not an unusual thing, how-
