a different original.  About the distance of a quarter of a
mile from the borough, there is situated an old church-
yard, which, from time immemorial, has served the pur-
pose of a burying ground to the town, and a part of the land-
ed parish annexed to it.  In former times, a large church was
built in the midst of this field, but it is now so completely
decayed, that there is not the finallest vestige of it to be seen.
This church was dedicated to St. Cuthbert; and the church-
yard is called at this day St. Cuthbert's church-yard.  The
contiguity of this burying field to the town, together with the
different ways of spelling Kirkcudbright, in some old authentic
writings, as Kilculbrigt, Kirkcudburgh, Kirkobrie, etc. inclines
us to think, that whatever might have been its ancient de-
signation, its present name is derived from St. Cuthbert, in
honour of the tutelary saint of this place.  Hence Kilcud-
bright, or Kirkcudbright, signifies the kirk or church of St.
Cuthbert.

   Erection and Extentent.-What is now called Kirkcudbright
Parish, formerly consisted of 3 separate and distinct parishes;
which are marked in the ancient valuation roll of the stewarty
by the names of Dunrod, Galtway, and Kirkcudbright.  These
names are still retained; and the different church-yards, which
are occupied at this day, as the burying grounds of the inha-
bitants of these parishes, sufficiently shew, that they were once
separated, and disjoined from each other.  The union of these
parishes, or rather the annexation of Dunrod and Galtway to
the parish of Kirkcudbright, appears to have taken place about
130 years ago.-The burgh-is the feat of the presbytery.  The
figure of the parish approaches nearly to an oblong square,
and stretches from N. to S.  The town, or burgh, lies on the
W. and projects a little on that side of the square.  The lenght
of the parish is 7 British miles its breadth from 3 to 4.
