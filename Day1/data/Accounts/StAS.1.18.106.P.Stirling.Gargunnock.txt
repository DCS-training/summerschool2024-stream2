coming; persuaded that experience would prove the excel-
lence of his plan.  A farm, said he, ought to consist of twelve
inclosures, and be managed as follows.  Summer fallow,
wheat, beans, barley, hay, pasture three years, oats, beans,
barley, oats, summer fallow, etc.  This order is found to an-
swer so well, that the farm of Woodyctt which exactly ob-
serves it, has always a better crop than any other in the parish.
The three years pasture is the chief thing which distin-
guishes his plan, and probably contributes most to give it
full effect.
   The wheat and barley land for the following year, is be-
gun to be ploughed about the end of harvest; and, if the
weather is at all favourable, the whole of this business is con-
cluded before the winter sets in.  Wheat is sown about the
middle of September, thereafter, when the field has been
ploughed five or six times.  The lee intended for oats, is
ploughed during the winter months, if the weather permits.
Beans are sown about the end of February, and beginning of
March, although in a climate so inconstant as ours, the seed
time is uncertain.  Beans sown and ploughed down on the
9th of January produced one of the best crops perhaps we
ever saw, and so wet was the ground a few years ago, that it
was not till the 6th day of April that any seed was sown in
this country.  The usual time for sowing oats is from the
20th of March to the end of April.  The barley is sown after
this, and the last in order, though not the least profitable, is
the turnip, a species of husbandry introduced of late by some
of the heritors, in which the tenants do not seem disposed to
follow their example.
   Beans are not sown in the dry fields, as the soil is not suf-
ficiently strong to bear a crop of this nature.  Peas are some-
times tried to advantage, but for the most part they run to
straw, without grain.  The rotation of crops in the dryfields
