     of Kilmartin.

the parish, is rather hilly than mountainous, with arable and
pasture grounds intermixed.  Some of the hills being covered
with green, and others with short heath, are considered as
good pasture for cattle.  The upper or N. E. end is much
higher land, more adapted to pasture than tillage, (though it
contains a considerable extent of arable ground), and, till of
late, has been occupied as such.  The soil in the lower end is
rather light, yet fertile, producing what are here considered
as good crops.  In the upper end it is deeper, yet the land
being high and cold, the grain is late in ripening and ill fill-
ed.  The valley, from the church of Kilmartin, to Lochow, is
one of the most beautiful in the Highlands.  The rocks co-
vered on each side with trees to their summits, form a pic-
turesque appearance; and the luxuriance of the wood shews
that planting of every fort would thrive well.  The cli-
mate does not differ much from other parts of the country;
but although wet, is not unhealthy.  Agues are seldom
known, nor are there any pulmonary complaints.  Fevers, of
the low and nervous sort, are found amongst the lower class,
arising from want of cleanliness, and from a poor diet.  The
soil is fertile, and yields good crops of barley.  There is a
large tract of moss near Crinan, which is very improveable;
and the proprietor, Mr. Malcolm of Poltalloch, much to his
credit, intends, it is said, to let it out in small portions to
tenants, for improving it, which will be of great use, both by
increasing population, and by setting an example, worthy to
be followed, in other parts of the country.

   Lakes, etc.-The only considerable lake in this parish is
Lochow, a part of which forms a boundary between it and
Glasrie to the N. E. for about 6 miles.  The whole lake is
computed to be 24 miles in length; but it is not broad in
