"Bruce was crowned 27th March 1306, Sir James, the 8th
"Lord Douglas, assisted, and cast into a heap, as did the o-
"ther Barons, a quantity of earth of his lands of Douglas;
"which, making a little hill, is called Omnis terra.  This
"was the custom of those times, by which homage, they
"who held the king of Scotland supreme under God were
"distinguished from others.  It is said that the Barons of
"Scotland could receive invesliture of their lands as lawfutly by
"delivering earth and stone from this spot, as from their own
"lands.  We are informed also, that anciently the conven-

   The tradition of the people of the parish concerning the
Boot-hill is, that at the coronation of a king, every man who
assisted brought so much earth in his boots, that every man
might see the king crowned, standing on his own land; and
that afterwards, they cast the earth out of their boots on this
hill, upon which account it obtained the names of Boot-hill
and Omnis terra.  But, perhaps, Boot-hill is a corruption of
Moot hill or Mute-hill; which is probably the same with the
Saxon word, folk-mote, and may signify the hill of meeting.
The people in the Highlands, it is said, call the Boot-hill, at
this day, Tom-a-mhoid, i. e. the hill where justice 13 adminis-
tered.  On the Boot-hill David, 1st viscount of Stormont, built
an elegant parish church about the year 1624, when the old
abbey church or what remained of it fell.  But, a few years
ago, this church wanting repairs, and being insufficient to
accommodate the parishioners, was, except the aisle, thrown
down, and the present parish church built in the village of
Scone.
