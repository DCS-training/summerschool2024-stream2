have presented a memorial upon this also, to the Post-
master General at Edinburgh, in which we shewed how
the law stood, and the several instances in which it had
been decided in the Courts of England against she poss-
masters, but no redress hs been obtained.  We have at

between these walls have been arched over, and divided

The space within the inner circle seems never to have
had any roof, as there are no fragments nor ruins there.
The building is not cemented with any sort of mortar;
the stones, which are whin, and many of them very large,
are all grooved into one another, that is the concavity of
