tick situation, close on the verge of the glen, but at what
particular period is not now known.  The S. W. wall of
the palace still remains a monument of the magnificent fa-
bric, of which it is a part, and tradition continues to point
out the chimney of the apartment where that unfortunate
monarch Charles I. was born.  The palace is said to have
been rebuilt* by Queen Anne of Denmark, but of this
there is no tradition in this place, nor as far as we know
any authentic proof whatever.  It appears to be a mistake,
arising from the words of and inscription found on a house
built for Queen Anne of Denmark, and adjoining to the pa-
lace.  The Queen's house continued in good repair long after
the palace was in ruins.  About 40 years ago, it was occu-
pied as an accademy by a Mr Moir, now a teacher in E-
dinburgh.  Within these 15 years, part of it was inhabit-
ed, but no attention being paid to keep it in repair, it
gradually became ruinous, and was lately sold, and made a
quarry for stones, and is to be entirely removed+.  With-
in these 30 years, there was to be seen in the bed-chamber
of an inn at Dunfermline, the nuptial bed of Queen Anne,
which she is said to have brought along with her from
Denmark.  For this piece of royal furniture, the innkeep-
er, Mrs Walker, a zealous Jacobite, entertained a very high
veneration.  Bishop Pocock of Ireland, happening to be in
her house, and having seen the bed, offered her 50 guiness
for it, which she refused, telling him, "that she still re-
"tained so great reverence for the two royal personages
