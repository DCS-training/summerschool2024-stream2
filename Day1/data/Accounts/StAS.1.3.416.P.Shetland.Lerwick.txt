carried on this fishery far more extensively than now.  It
has been on the decline with them ever since the year 1703.
They had then about 500 busses in Shetland, under the con-
voy of 4 ships of 6 ships of war, sent out for the purpose, sell
in with the Dutch ships of war off Fair island; and an en-
gagement taking place, the Dutch Admiral's ship was sunk,
on which the remaining 3 run away, and made their escape.
Whereupon the French sleet sailed for the entry of Brassia
Sound, sent their boats into the Bay, and burnt and destroy-
ed about 400 of the Dutch fishing vessels, sparing only a
number barely sufficient to carry home the crews of the 
whole.  Bressay Sound abounds with a variety of slounders;
but it is imagined, that there is no fishing in the country
more universally beneficial, than that of a small fish called
fellocks.  Thre bays, during the winter season, generally abound
with these, and they occasion a very considerable saving of
the small crops of grain.  The quantity of oil made in Shet-
land from sellocks, from October 1790 to April 1791, must
have considerably exceeded 2000 barrels; this, however, is
more than is commonly obtained.

   Kelp.-This parish does not produce above 6 tons of kelp
yearly; and the annual export of this article, from the whole
country, does not much exceed 200 tons.  Doubtless more 
might be made; but the quantity must still be inconsiderable,
the shores being steep, and the fall of water not exceeding 6
or 7 feet of perpendicular height, even with spring tides.

   Tides, Shipwrecks, etc.-The edd tides here run north,
and the flood tides to the fouthward, unless on the north and
south extremities of the country, where they run east and
west; their rapidity is inconsiderable, at least when compar-
