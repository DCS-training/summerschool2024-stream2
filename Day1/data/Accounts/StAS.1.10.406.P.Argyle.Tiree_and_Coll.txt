cupied by small tenants, 1200 or 1500 males and females,
above eight year old, might be spared for fishing and other
manufactures.  For which purpose, wherever the situation
admits of it, every farm, especially those from 30 to 200 in-
habitants, should be subdivided and inclosed to one, or at
most four tenants each division.  These few would be more
disposed to improve their farms than now, in common with
many, whose main study is to plough all they can, though
but ill prepared for a good crop.  Numerous inhabitants are
agreeable, and have their uses.  Here they may be made still
more numerous; but when with a view to serve them all,
lands in common are divided into very small portions, such
families can never thrive.  If the superfluous number of ten-
ants were converted into manufacturers, the remaining ones
would be more easily enabled to pay their rents, even if aug-
mented, live better, educate their children, and sell more to
support the manufacturers, who in return would enrich the
country from a variety of sources.  As this parish, when im-
proved, might support a village in most of the necessaries of
life, besides the above divisions, for the encouragement of
tradesmen, a convenient situation should be chosen for inclo-
sures of a few acres, for greens, roots, grass seeds, &c. which,
though some of them could not afford to keep a horse, they
might improve like a garden with the spade, or by occasion-
ally hiring a horse or plough.  Lands, in common with
others, would ruin a tradesmen, whereas such separate pos-
sessions would cause a great emulation for improvements, and
would be equally to the advantage of proprietors and tenants.
   The ingredients with which any country abounds, point
out the manufactures proper to begin with.  Accordingly, as
part of this soil could produce good flax, the culture of, and
preparation of it should be studied, as none of these are well
understood here.  The abundance of a superior quality of
