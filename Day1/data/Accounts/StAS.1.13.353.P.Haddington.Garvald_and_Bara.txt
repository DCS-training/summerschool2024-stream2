*The parishes of Garvald and Baro were united in 1703.  The present 
incumbent's immediate predecessor preached, in terms of the decreet of
annexation, at Garvald and Baro, per alternatas vices, till about the year
1743 or 1744, when the kirk of Baro sell into dispair.  It is now a

Garvald, never Garvit.
