   ber of small streets and lanes strike off at right angles,--an ar-
   rangement, which, in many instances, has the effect of presenting
   the gables of the houses to the street.  The houses are in gene-
   ral of two stories high.  Both the church and the jail have
   steeples.  The flat on which the town stands, which is scarcely
   four feet above the extreme flood-mark, is about half a mile wide.
   To the west of the town, however, it contracts to about half this
   width,--the southern ridge of Strathpeffer fallipg back at this
   point, and forming the recess occupied by the town.  To the
   north of the town stands the hill of Tulloch,--a continuation of
   the northern ridge of Strathpeffer, which rires to the height of
   about 800 feet.  Its acclivity presents an aspect of uncommon
   luxuriance.  It is occupied by several farms, which are ornament-
   ed by rows of fine old trees; and by the beautiful grounds attach-
   ed to Tulloch Castle, which stands midway, about a mile from
   the town,
   		   " Embosomed deep in tufted trees,"

   The summit of the hill is covered with wood, which is disposed in
   masses.  Behind this hill, and distant about six miles, is seen
   Ben Wyvis, whose massy form affords a complete shelter from the
   north and north-west.
