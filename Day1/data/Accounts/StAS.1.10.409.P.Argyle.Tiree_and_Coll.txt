munication with Clyde will soon be opened.  Some person
residing constantly in the parish, with a store of salt to pur-
chase whatever quantity might be caught, even in winter and
spring, when some of the fish are best in season, might be of
essential service.  But of all encouragements to make them
persevere, the best is, to improve some harbours or creeks in
the most convenient places; at least one upon the N. side,
convenient for the great bank between Tiry and Barra, but
one third nearer Tiry; and on the S. side Scairnish, the
common harbour, which admits of considerable improve-
ments.  In its present state the entrance is very dangerous,
being too long, and in most places not above 40 yards wide,
between two rocks, and a third lying cross at the very en-
trance.  When in stormy weather the wind is S. or W. a
heavy swell from the Atlantic enters the harbour.  When
the wind is N. N. by E. or N. W. a vessel that might come
within a few fathoms of the shore, must sheer off again to
sea in a storm.  When within the harbour, the wind may be
many days fair for a voyage, but a vessel cannot get out of it.
At once to prevent such misfortunes and make the island
much more valuable, a small expence may build a quay, at
least as far out as it ebbs, to be secured from the impetuous
surge, partly with timber and iron, but mostly with loose
stones behind, which are at hand.  A short quay at each
side of the entrance, overlapping each other, with small breast
works within, may be the most eligible.  Near this, on the
W. side of the bay of Gott, is excellent anchoring ground.
It opens southwards, is within 2 miles of the E. end of the
island, and runs near 2 miles into the land.  The bottom is
sand mixed with clay and sea grass; and, though sometimes
there be a swell, I have seen vessels ride, in great storms,
without driving one foot.  The entrance is very safe, and the
depth gradually decreasing, from 16 fathoms, to the smallest
