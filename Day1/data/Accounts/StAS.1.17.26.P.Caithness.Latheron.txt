   Cattle, etc.-In the Highland part of the parish the cattle
are small and hardy; there is much room for the improve-
ment of them.  The sheep and horses are also of a small
kind, excepting Sir John Sinclair's flock at Langwall.

   Prices of Labour and Provisions.-These two articles are
greatly increased of late years.  A day-labourer gets from
8 d. to 1 s. a day; women 4 d. and 5 d.  Men servants from
3 L. to 4 L. besides 6 bolls of meal, or their maintenance in
the house; women servants, besides maintenance receive
from 30 s. to 40 s. a year.-Pork and mutton sell commonly
at 3 d. the pound, and even beef in some seasons of the year.
There is no market in the parish, nor any one nearer than
20 or 30 miles The gentlemen, for the most part, must
therefore kill for their own use.

   Service.-It were greatly to be wished that services were
entirely abolished, as they are much against industry and
improvement.  However, according to the present mode of
farming, some sort of services may be absolutely necessary.
Although unlimited services are wearing out by degrees, yet
they are still continued in sundry respects, which is both sla-
vish and detrimental to the tenants.  They have a tendency
to hurt their morals, as well to hinder industry and im-
provement.
