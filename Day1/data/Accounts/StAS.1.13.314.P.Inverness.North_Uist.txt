   Fisheries.-The constant round of employment in which
the people are engaged throughout the year, puts it out
of their power to pay any attention to fishing, though,
without doubt, the sea all around the coast abounds
with the fish of different kinds.  Soon after the sowing sea-
son (which generally is from the beginning of April to 
the latter end of May) is over, they remove, with their 
cows, sheep and horses, to the east coast, where the kelp
shores for the most lie; and where they continue manu-
facturing kelp till the 10th of August.  About the begin-

and it is in general the latter end of October before they
can secure it in their corn-yards.  They begin to manure
the ground very early in winter, and continue at it when
the weather permits, till the sowing season comes on a-
gain.  The present laws respecting salt are a great bar in
the way of fishing, though the people could otherwise at-
tend to it.
