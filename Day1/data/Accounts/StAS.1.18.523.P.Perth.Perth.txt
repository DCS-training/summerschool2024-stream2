     of Perth.

   Guthry, in his History of Scotland, when speaking of a
company of English players, who came to Scothland in the
year 1599, says, "I have great reason to think that Shake-
"spear was one of the number."  That actor and writer of
plays, most probably, began his excursions before the year
1589.  If therefore they were English actors who were at
Perth that year, he might perhaps be one of them.
   In the record, the minister and elders speak of the actors as
being all of them men.  For it was not till some time after
the restoration of King Charles II. that women appeared
upon the stage.  No doubt, if some restrictions, similar to
those in the record were now in use, a reformation of the
stage might be expected.
   There are no hackney coaches in Perth, but many post-
chaises, which are often used as such coaches are in the larger
towns.  There are some persons who keep carriages of their
own; and still a greater number who keep men-servants in
livery, as being suitable to the stile of living which they are
able to support.
   There are great taverns, and a coffee-room; but there are
no gaming-houses that I know of, nor any persons who seem
to make gaming a trade.  The opulent inhabitants live gen-
teely, and are cautions not to exceed in their expences.  In
the year 1793, when there were many failures in other places,
there was not one of any consequence in Perth.  It has often
been noticed, as what is honourable to Perth, that those of
the better rank, set a good example, by giving a regular at-
tendance in the churches.
   The craftsmen in Perth, were long distinguished by a strict
regard to religion, and by the remarkable care which they
took in training up their children, their apprentices, and even
their journeymen, in good principles and practices.  I trust
it is still generally the case.  I have heard, however, from
