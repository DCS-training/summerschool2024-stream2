			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The improvements which have taken place in the agriculture
of the parish, from draining, and the application of lime, fish, and
bone manure, have been already mentioned. The great advantages
likely to result from the new turnpike road have been also stated.
There has likewise, within these two years, been a large extent of
hilly and moorish ground lying towards Fordyce enclosed for plant-
ing. It is called the Cotton Hill, and contains about 250 impe-
rial acres, of which 190 are already planted. When the whole
shall be completed, which is likely to take place in another year,
it will extend the plantations in the parish to 850 acres. The
drains which have been made for drying this piece of ground ex-
tend to upwards of 19 miles, and the dikes and ditches enclosing
it to above 6 miles.
  But the principal improvement, it is believed, is of a moral na-
ture. Notwithstanding the still too great facilities for inebriety,
it is much less common than when those facilities were more nu-
merous. The Sabbath is more reverently and profitably spent;
and the introduction of Sabbath schools and Sabbath school
books has led to passing the other evenings of the week in a more im-
proving manner, than they were wont to be spent some twenty years
ago, and even much later. Then, in winter, when the ordinary
labours were over, and the out-door pastimes could not be en-
joyed, cards were the common resource both for masters and ser-
vents, whether in the parlour or in the kitchen. Now, such a
thing is scarcely ever seen or thought of. But the present more
profitable way of employing their leisure hours, and the superior
moral and religious training now enjoyed, generally throughout
the country are likely to be exhibited more fully in their effects,
when the rising generation shall be grown up, and shall have en-
tered into the important relation of parents and heads of families.
