     Statistical Account

nine years, from the 1st of January 1789, 7436 barrels of
herrings have been caught and cured yearly at the port of
Thurso.  Of this number two-thirds, or 4958 barrels, are
cured as white herrings; and one-third, or 2478 barrels are
cured as red herrings.  The white herrings are valued at
L. 1, 5 s. and the red herrings at L. 1, 10 s. per barrel,
which is not by any means an over rate.  Both kinds are
in general sent coastwise from the port of Thurso to the
port of London; whence the white herrings are for the most
part exported tot he West Indies; and the red herrings are
there entered for home consumption.
   The average of cod and ling is taken at 800 barrels of
wet cod, being what is caught in the winter and spring sea-
sons, and 55 tons of dried fish, being what is caught and
dried in the summer and harvest months.  These also find
their market in London, and are partly exported from
thence, and partly entered there for home consumption.
   Besides the aforesaid herrings, cured and packed into bar-
rels at the port, there is seldom a season in which there are
not some cargoes of herrings in bulk sent to the ports of
Dunbar and Berwick, where they are afterwards packed
into barrels, or sold for immediate use to the country people.
The herrings sent annually in this way, would, if packed,
fill 1000 barrels at the most moderate computation.
   Before the year 1770, the herring-fishery on the Caith-
ness coast never amounted to 900 barrels of cured herrings
in one season.  That year the quantity cured was 1853
barrels; and from that period the fishing increased gradu-
ally for a few years; but afterwards fell off again, and did
not revive with spirit until the year 1788, since which pe-
riod it has continued to be carried on with good success.
   It appears, that early in the present century, there was a
very considerable cod-fishing carried on at the port of
Thurso, in which some of the first proprietors in the coun-
