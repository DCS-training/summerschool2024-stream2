more adapted to sheep pasture.  The few hills are green and
dry.  The air is moist and chilly; greatly changes in different
parts of the parish: all kinds of farm work can be carried on
in the lower grounds, when it rains, or even a fall of snow
appears in the heights.  It is, however, a healthy parish.
There are at present inhabitants above 80 years of age.  The
diseases most common, are rheumatisms, pains in the stomach
and bowels, owing, likely, to the low and damp situation of
their houses.  In former times, the smal-pox frequently pre-
vailed, and in some seasons almost depopulated the country.
About 12 years ago, this fatal disease raged in the lower parts
of Tiviotdale, which determined Lord Douglas to hold out
and advantages of inoculation to the poorer fort in this pa-
rish.  The physician, employed by his Lordship, was suc-
cessful.  Inoculation is now become almost universally the
practice.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls then, was 480.  From tradition, as well as in-
numerable vestiges and ruins of houses, population must have
been considerable about a century ago, and from general opi-
nion, it is greatly diminished.  In a late measurement of the
Forest estate in this parish, the arable land is computed at
4865 acres, the evident traces of former times; the present
arable ground is limited to a few hundred acres.  It is said,
the examination-roll in I724, amounted to upwards of 1600.
An accurate list of the inhabitants was taken about 17 years
ago, and fell short of 900.  This decrease became rapid, from
the junction of farms.  There are at present 714 souls in the
parish: above 10 years of age 569.  The number of deaths
cannot be so well ascertained, and the marriages still less.
The annual number of births is 10.
