bolls were used in the parish, the rest being sold to other
countries:  2500 bolls, at the above price, come to 2083 L.
6 s. 8 d.  We may safely say, that the parish pays at least,
that sum for meal every year; for seldom, very seldom, it is,
that it sells so reasonably, as is above stated.  Of whisky, there
are annually imported into the parish, and drunk in it, about
15,000 gallons, which, at 4 s. each gallon, costs 3,000 L.  The
exports are, fish, wool, sheep, horses, and black cattle.
During the summer and harvest 1791, there were taken, by
the people of the parish, about 3,000 barrels of herrings,
which, at 18 s. per barrel, is 2700 L.
