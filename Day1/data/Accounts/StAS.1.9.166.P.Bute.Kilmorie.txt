south-east, to Lochrannza, in the north extreme of Arran.
It is bounded on the S. E. S. W. and N. W. of Arran.
and in the narrowest place is only 0 miles from Kintyre;
on the N. E. by a spacious central common moor, where
the horses and sheep of the island range promisenously in
summer-The surface of the parish is uneven and hilly;
the soil is various, partly gravelish, clay, and mossy, and
is capable of producing light crops of barley, oats, (in
some places,) pease, and flax only for private use; but po-
tatoes are planted in every farm, and are tile general food
of the people.

   Diseases.-The diseases here, are cancers, rheums, fevers
brought from other countries, and a great death of new-
born infants, by the falling down of the jaws; and some
women die in childbed, both which last two are attributed
to the unskilfulness of midwives, who venture upon the
practice from natural courage, without necessary and pro-
per knowledge, there being none duly qualified in the
island.  The oldest man now living in the parish is 88, a
few more have turned 80, anti there has been an instance
of 1 who reached 95.

   Rivers, Lochs or Lakes.-The burns here, which scarce
deserve the name of rivers, have, some of them, their
source from lochs or lakes in the mountains, and some from
numberless springs; after a short and rapid course they empty
themselves into the sea; they abound with fine trouts, and
some salmon.  There are 3 lochs or lakes; the principal
of which is Earsay loch, in the west of the island, which
abounds with trouts of different sizes, and fine salmon,
which are caught by cruives and draught-lines.
