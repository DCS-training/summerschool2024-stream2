   The castle of Ardkinglass* is composed of three separate
towers, each of them fronting area within.  The space,
between the towers, is defended by a strong wall, about 15
feet high.  In the course of this wall is the great gate, which
is defended by small round turrets in slank, with apertures,
through which those who assailed the gate might be annoy-
ed with arrows, or with small fire-arms.  The gate is also
defended by a small tower, immediately above it, called the
gate-tower.  Around the area, and within the walls, are
smaller buildings, for lodging servants, for holding arms,
and for storehouses and cellars.  This castle, is also built
in a low situation, and could not stand out against a regular

means the residence of a great family; it seems to express the
same meaning which the word place conveys in some parts of
the low country of Scotland.  Ard signifies high.  In former
times, powerful families usually built in high situations, parti-
cularly on promontories, for defence; and the name is still con-
tinued, though the circumstance which first gave rise to it has
ceased to exist.
