due south or north.  The greatest quantity of rain falls during the
prevalence of the west wind.
   The following table, kept at Jerviston in 1828, 1829, and 1830,
shews the periods during which the different winds prevailed in
these years.

   As the mornings and evenings in spring and autumn have of
late years not unfrequently been cold and frosty, and the winters
on the other hand open, the following observations with respect
to the degrees of cold at which different crops are injured, made
many years ago by the late Mr Henderson, gardener at Woodhall,
a man no less distinguished for his personal worth than his pro-
fessional eminence, may not prove devoid of interest.

   Frosts in this district seldom penetrate a foot into the earth.
From thermometers kept under ground during two years, it was
ascertained that the lowest temperature at one foot from the surface
was 33&deg;, at two feet 35&deg;, and at three feet 39&deg;, and the highest at
these respective depths 35&deg;, 52&deg;, 5 and 52&deg;.

but it is considered peculiarly salubrious in the neighbourbood of
the village of Bothwell.  The medical practitioners in Glasgow
not unfrequently advise their patiennts when in delicate health to
seek for convalescence from a residence there during the summer
months.  Summer quarters in the village and neighbourhood are
consequently in great request, and the hopes of the visitants are
