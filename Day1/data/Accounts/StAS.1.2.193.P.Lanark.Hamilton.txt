fences, where the soil is thin, and the bottom retentive of
water.
   Upon the whole, this parish is rather a beautiful than a fer-
tile country, and cultivation has been more successful in en-
riching the scenery, than in multiplying the annual produc-
tions.  Not that the land is incapable of improvement: for
there several spots, particularly such as have been in the
possession of small proprietors, which have been rendered
more than doubly productive, in the course of the last thirty
years.  Nor are the husbandmen deficient in industry, or a
disposition to labour:  But a variety of adverse contingencies
has disappointed the good effects, which such dispositions
might have produced.  Villages have been demolished, and
land, which formerly gave sufficient employment to three
or four families, has been put into the possession of one man.
Rents have been raised, in some instances, beyond what the
ability of the tenants could pay, who have thus been made
bankrupt, driven from their farms, and succeeded by others,
no better qualified than the former possessors.  From these and
other circumstances, which would take too much time here to
enumerate, agricultural stock has been dissipated, and the num-
bers, the energy and enterprise of husbandmen necessarily
diminished.  Thus, the improvement of a country, which,
from the nature of its soil and elimate, requires the most vigo-
rous exertions, and the most vigilant attention to cultivate
it to the best advantage, has been greatly impeded.
   The rent of land, at a distance from the town, left in lease
for 19 years, is from 5 or 6s to a guinea per acre.  Good land,
near the town, is let from L. 3 to L. 5; and there are instan-
ces of rich land, which had been long in pasture or highly ma-
nured, being let, for a short space of time, from L. 5 to L. 8,
for raising wheat and other grains.
