     (Presbytery of Dornoch.-Synod of Sutherland and
     Caithness.-County of Sutherland.)

     By the Reverend Mr WALTER ROSS.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Clyne seems to have got its name from
the Kirktown of the parish, which is situated on a de-
clivity, and was called Clyne from the Celtic word claonodh
or inclining.  The inhabited part of it extends in length,
from the N. W. to the S. E. about 24 measured miles.  Its
greatest breadth, near the N. W. boundary, extends about 8,
and on the S. or S. E. along the shore, about 4 measured
miles.  The form of the parish is a trapezium.  What may
be called the Lowlands extends along the shore about 3 mea-
sured miles, and towards the hill from the shore, its greatest
extent is about 1 1/2 mile, in some parts not exceeding 1/2 mile.

   Population, Cattle, etc.-The Lowland track contains about
700 inhabitants; the remaining Highland part about 960.-
The Highland part of the parish breeds all the domestic animals,
viz. horses, black cattle, sheep, and goats.  No hogs are
reared for exportation, but many by the inhabitants for their
own use, which they sell to one another at no contemptible
prices.  Betwixt 400 and 500 black cattle are exported yearly
