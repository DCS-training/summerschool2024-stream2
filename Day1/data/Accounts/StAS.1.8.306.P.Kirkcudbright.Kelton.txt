one near the north end, and the other near the south end of
it.  There isles were places of rest, for large quantities of wa-
ter fowls, of various kinds, which annually came and bred
there; even wild geese, it is said, have been sometimes known
to breed on these isles.  There was always a tradition in the
parish, that there had been a town in the Loch, which sunk,
or was drowned; and that there were two churches or chapels,
one on each of the large isles:  There is also a tradition, that
the cannon, with which James the IVth. battered the castle of
Thrieve, was made, (that is, the staves were put together and
hooped,) at Buchan's Crost on the west side of the Loch.  One
of the balls, weighing 48 pounds, picked out of the wall of
Thrieve, is now at Greenlaw.  The vestige, or foundation of
an iron forged was discovered on the south isle.  Around it,
likewise, there had been a stone building, or rampart; and,
from this isle, to the opposite side, on the N. E. there is a
road of stone secured by piles of oak wood, with an opening,
supposed to have been for a draw-bridge.  In several places
of the Loch, canoes were found, which, appear to have been
hollowed, after the manner of the American Savages, with
fire.  On a small isle, near the north end of the Loch, there
was found a large iron mallet or hammer, stained on one end
with blood.  It is now in the hands of the Antiquarian So-
ciety at Edinburgh, and is supposed to have been an instru-
ment used by the ancient Druids, in killing their sacrifices.
On several of the little isles in the Loch, were large frames of
black Oak, neatly joined.  There are two small isles, that
have been evidently formed by strong piles of wood driven in-
to the moss and marl, on which were placed large frames of
black oak.  The tops of these were fully six feet under water
before the Loch was drained.  The design of these works is
not at present known.
