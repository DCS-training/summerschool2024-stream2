Knowledge.  It has been observed of late years, that the number
of Latin scholars has decreased much, several parishes of consi-
derable population being destitute of these entirely. Perhaps this is
not, much to be regretted. Some of the parochial and other teach-
ers have adopted Mr Wood's system of tuition with great success,
-a method certainly, superior to the old mechanical system, and
which at an early age gives such scope and exercise for the intel-
lectual powers. The establishment of normal schools for initiat-
ing young men in the important and arduous task of teaching, from
whom parochial schoolmasters could be selected, would, it is ge-
nerally believed, be attended with salutary effects, and tend much
to improve and increase the efficiency of the present system.  The
schools are annually examined by committees of the respective
presbyteries within whose limits they are situated, and the reports
transmitted to the General Assembly.  In all the schools the Scrip-
tures are daily read.
   Sunday schools prevail in most parishes, and it cannot be doubted
that their effect is beneficial, when they are conducted by teachers of
good character, and sound religious principle.  It is thought, how-
ever, by some, that they have a tendency to make parents careless
about the religious instruction of their children,-an effect which
would be much to be deplored, as certainly this kind of knowledge
cannot be imparted with such interest and efficiency from any
lips as from those of a parent. On the other hand, when pa-
rents are negligent with regard to the spiritual improvement of
their families, as is sometimes the case, Sunday schools supply this
de ficiency, and are highly useful and salutary.
