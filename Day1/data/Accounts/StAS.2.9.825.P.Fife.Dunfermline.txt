years specified, viz. from the beginning of 1825 to the end of
1834, derived from observations made daily at nine o'clock in the
morning. There is also a column to indicate the deviations in
excess or defect of the means for each mouth from the mean
height of the barometer, during the whole period of observation.

   Thus it appears that the average mean pressure, taken from
the means of the months, is 29.44 ; that the means in excess are
one more than in defect; that the former obtain in five conse-
cutive months, from May to September, both inclusive; and that
in the month of October there was an equality.
   The mean height of the barometer during the twelve months,
and the highest and lowest state of it in the course of each year
of the above specified period, as also its annual range or difference
between these two conditions, was as follows:-

height of the thermometer during the twelve months of each of
the years in the fore-mentioned period as also its highest and
lowest state in each year of it:-
