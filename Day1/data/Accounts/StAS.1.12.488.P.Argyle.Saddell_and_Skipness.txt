The fines, for instance, for fornication and adultery, have not

norant of those party distinctions, and controversial disputes
which disgrace and divide the religous in some parts of the

essential requisities of private and public, present and future
happiness, it will suggest considerations of the most affecting
nature to every person who is not totally divested of every
