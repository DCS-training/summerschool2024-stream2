   It may be proper to mention here, although it belongs more to
the history of the country than of a particular parish, that, in the
year 1815, the three parishes of Greenock, with the parishes of
Kilmalcolm, Port-Glasgow, and Inverkip, were constituted the
lower ward of Renfrewshire, and placed under the jurisdiction of
a sheriff-substitute, who holds his courts in Greenock, as the chief
town of the district.  Claud Marshall, Esq. the present highly re-
spected sheriff-substitute, was the first person appointed to that
office.
   Eminent Men.--There are few parishes which can boast of being
connected with so great a number of eminent men as Greenock. In
the family of the Shaws, besides the public-spirited individual the last
of that name, to whom we have particularly adverted, one of his an-
cestors, towards the end of the sixteenth century, distinguished him-
self by his zeal for the Protestant religion; another by his bravery
in the wars of the Commonwealth, fighting on the King's side. The
last Sir John acquired no less renown by his vigorous exertions in
favour of the House of Hanover and the existing Government,
during the Rebellion in 1715.  In the family of Shaw Stewart,
the descendants, as we have seen, of a female branch of the Shaws
of Greenock, there have appeared some of the most accomplished

election, deeply lamented.  Mr Macleish was elected in his room.
