     Statistical Account

as there was but a small part of the area of the choir which
had not before been occupied with seats.
   It could not be expected that the public funds of the town
were to keep pace with the increase of inhabitants, so as to
afford the number of churches necessary.  Attempts were
made from time to time, to obtain a chapel of ease, the reme-
dy usual in other towns; but they did not succeed.  Only in
the year 1788, a chapel was built by subscription for the
Highlanders in Perth, and a minister provided who should
preach to them in the Gaelic Language.
   The following is a list of the several churches and religious
congregations in Perth.
   The people of the established church, who are above two
thirds of the inhabitants, have 3 churches, which altogether
contain about 2300 persons.  They have 2 ministers, and an
ordained assistant.  The town council also have provided an
assistant for the senior minister.
   The rectory tithes usually paid, are divided betwixt the
2 ministers.  Each of them has yearly from the heritors, 80
bolls oat-meal, and 70 bolls barley; also of vicarage tithes,
L. 3:14:5 1/3.  The town council pay yearly, out of the seat
rents, to each of the 2 ministers, L. 21:5:6 2/3; and have
lately added, during their pleasure, L. 20 more.  The town
council pay yearly, to the ordained assistant L. 100; and
during their pleasure to the assistant of the senior minister,
L. 50 yearly.
   The Gaelic chapel has one minister, whose yearly stipend
is L. 50, out of the seat rents of the chapel.
   There is a new chapel in Paul's street, which contains
about 1000 people, who do not reckon themselves dissen-
ters, but with their chapel should be received as a chapel of
case to the established church.  They have agreed to give to
a minister who shall preach to them, L. 100 yearly.
