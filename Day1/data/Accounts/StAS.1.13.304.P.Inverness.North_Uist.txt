vey narrow; the soil sandy, lies quite exposed to the
Western Ocean, which makes yearly encroachments, and
is in danger of being soon blown away by the wind.  The
latter is 3 miles long, and half a mile broad in most places.
The soil is partly sandy, and partly black ground, yielding
tolerable crops of barley and pasture for cattle.  South of
the main land of North Uist, between it and Benbecula, lies
Grimsay, an island only at high water.  This is a barren
island, 2 miles in length, and covered with heath; but is
very valuable on account of its kelp shores.  It is in the
possession of Mr Maclean of Boreray, and is included in
the long lease already mentioned.

   Produce.-Barley and small oats are the only kinds of
grain that this parish produces; the quantity and value of
which can hardly be ascertained, on account of the variable-
ness of the seasons.  The only method of finding out, with
any degree of precision, the average quantity, is from a
state of the multure.  The 13th part of the grain ground
in the mills is taken up by the millers for multure, of
which they are obliged to pay 180 bolls to the proprietor.
As they are bound to keep the mills (of which there are 3
in the parish) in repair, they will require 8 bolls each for
that purpose; and also 18 bolls each for the support of
their families, so that the 13th part will amount to 258,
and consequently the whole that is brought to the mills
will amount to 3354 bolls.  Besides this quantity, there
are at least 500 bolls given as provender to cows and horses.
In favourable seasons, indeed, the quantity will be a great 
deal more; but in seasons it will fall far short of it.  A
dry summer scorches the sandy soil, and a wet stormy au-
tumn destroys every thing the ground produces.  A scarcity
is the consequence.  In this case, recourse must be had to the
importation of low-country meal, which is purchased at
