     Statistical Account

and it has something of the air of antiquity about it.  Per-
haps it is not unlike some of the Roman aqueducts.
   For this reason, several distinguished antiquarians of rank
and literature have supposed it to be a Roman bridge.  As
far as I could learn, they have been disposed to be of this
opinion, principally, because it is within half a mile of the
great Roman wall, precisely at an equal distance from the
east and west end of it, across the valley, which was the
boundary of their dominions; and at the only narrow place
over which a bridge could conveniently be thrown; at least
if that valley, as was supposed, was at that time either an
extended lake or impassable morass.
   Besides there extrinsic circumstances, the bridge was sup-
posed to bear in itself evident marks of its being a Roman
antique.  It was narrow, being only about 9 feet wide; it
had no edges, at least, none above 4 inches high; and above
all, it had a semita or foot-path, of hewn stone, about 10
inches wide on either side.
   But all there circumstances put together, though in the
eyes of an antiquarian they may seem to amount nearly to
demonstration, must give way to stubborn facts.
   In cutting the course of the Kelvin, not 20 yards below
this bridge, there was found the remains of a paved ford or
causeway, built together with wood, which was still entire;
a few horses shoes, and pieces of iron were found in it.
This revived the general suspicion, that the bridge was not so
old as was supposed; and a tradition that about 100 years
ago a man and horse perished in passing this sord.  But
what put the matter beyond the possibility of a doubt, and
confirms the above tradition is, that among the late Lord
Kilsyth's old papers, of which I shall have occasion to speak
afterwards, I find that his Lordship made application to the
quarter Sessions at Stirling, in the year 1670, for money to
