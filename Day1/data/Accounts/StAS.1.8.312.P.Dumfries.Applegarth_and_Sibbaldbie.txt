     Statistical Account

by the advice of the Kirk-Session, amongst the poor in the
barony of Applegarth, and nine merk land of Sibbaldbie
which is that part of the old parish of Sibbaldbie, that belongs
to the estate of Applegarth.

   Fuel and Mills.-The common fuel is peats, the procuring
of which occasions a very great labour for the people, during
the whole of summer; and, in wet seasons, the inhabitants are
greatly distressed for want of fuel in winter.  There are 3
corn mills in the parish, a barley and lint mill were lately
built on the water of Dryfe, and another lint mill is now
building on the water of Annan.

   Cattle and Produce.-There are only 2 or 3 sheep farms in
the parish.  The number of sheep does not exceed 1800 or
2000.  There are about 1500 black cattle, 150 horses, and
60 ploughs.  The farmers, in general, are in tolerable good
circumstances; and, from the high prices of black cattle, (the
crops also being good after liming, and oats, meal and barley,
giving a good price,) they are now better able to pay their
rents, than they were some years ago, though the rents have
been raised considerably.  The average price of barley is from
2 s. 6 d. to 3 s., the Winchester bushel; of oats 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d.
and oat meal 1 s. 8 d. or 1 s. 9 d. per stone.  These are the
staple commodities by which many of the tenants pay their
rents.  A considerable number of black cattle also are reared
in the parish; and there, when about a year and a half old,
are fold for about 2 L. 10 s. or 3 L. each.

   Cultivation.-Several of the farmers are now getting into a
better mode of managing their farms, by summer fallowing,
by sowing turnips, planting cabbages, and other green crops,
after which they sow barley with grass feeds.  It is not long
