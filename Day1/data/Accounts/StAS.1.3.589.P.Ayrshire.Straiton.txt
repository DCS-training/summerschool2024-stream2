cattle in Galloway, both in size and shape.

   Prices of Provisions.- The price of butcher meat depends
upon the Ayr market.  It is commonly sold at halfpenny per
pound cheaper in Straiton than in Ayr.  A pair of fowls sells
art 1 s. 4 d.; chickens, 6 d.; a dozen of eggs, 2 d.; a pound
of butter, 8 d.

   Rivers.- The Doon, the eastern boundary of Carrick,
issuing from the lake of the same name, 7 miles in length,
washes from the east and north east side of the parish; and run-
ning north-west about 18 miles, empties itself into the Frith
of Clyde, about 2 miles south from Ayr.  In both loch and
river there are salmon, red and white trouts, and cuddings,
or charr.  The rains used formerly to raise the loch in such
a manner, that the river, receiving the accumulated water
from this reservoir, frequently overflowed its banks, and de-
stroyed the meadows.  The rock, over which the loch dis-
charged itself, has lately been cut in two places at consider-
able expence, by the Earl of Cassilis, and Mr M'Adam of
Craigingillian, the proprietors on each side; so that, by means
of sluices, not only the damage is prevented, but some land
is gained, by a diminution of the extent of the loch.  The
Girvan has its source in the parish, about 8 miles above the
village.  Like the Doon, it rises from a loch, or rather a
great number of lochs, the principal of which are the Garany
and Braden.  These two, and 12 other lochs in the parish,
are inhabited, some of them by red, and some by white
trouts, some by both, and one of them entirely by pikes.  In
the Water of Girvan, there are Trouts and salmon.  The   
course of the Girvan, till it pass the village, is north-west.
