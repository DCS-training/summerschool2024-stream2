lying in the immediate vicinity of the village, and to which all
within the parish have a right for pasturage.
   The wood generally planted is larch, until the last two years,
when a considerable quantity of oak has been planted.  The farms
are generally let for a term of nineteen years, and the rents, being
paid partly in victual, convertible at the fiars prices, are conse-
quently variable.  According to present prices, the whole parish
will not yield an average of L. 1, 10s. per acre.  There are
upwards of 100 acres, however, in the immediate neighbourhood
of the village, let out in small portions at much higher rents than
the farms, and varying from L. 1, 10s. to L. 5 per acre.  The
common rate of wages for farm-servants is L. 10 to a married man,
with 6 1/2 bolls of oatmeal, a house, and a cow kept on the farm.
Unmarried men receive from L. 9 to L. 10, with 6 1/2 bolls of meal.
Female servants receive from L. 4, 10s. to L. 5.  Day-labourers
are paid at the rate of 1s. 6d. a-day in summer, and 1s. 4d. in winter.
   With the exception of a few fields, the parish may be said to be
wholly destitute of enclosures.  The farm-buildings, however, are
substantial; two of them of recent erection are very superior.
   Produce.-There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the
average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish, but the
following may be taken as a pretty near approximation:

   The real rent of the parish is about L. 2500.
   In the item of grass in the above statement, the calculation is made
according to the estimated value of pasturage during the season
for a cow or full-grown ox.  The calculation concerning the grain
has reference chiefly to the prices of 1833 and 1834.
   Manufactures.-The principal manufacture is hand-loom weav-
ing, in which there is a very considerable number, both of men and
women, employed.  They receive their work chiefly from manu-
facturers in Dundee.  Several of the inhabitants are employed at
this work in winter, who go to other employments in summer.  An
industrious hand-loom weaver, can now earn from 10s. to 12s. a-
week.
   Fishing.-There is a considerable salmon-fishing belonging to
