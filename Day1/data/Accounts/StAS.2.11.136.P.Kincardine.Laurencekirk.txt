facture of linen, which was commonly known in the markets by the
name of "Mearns linen," and the spinning of the yarn, and manu
facturing of the cloth, afforded employment to many hands in the
families both of tenants and of crofters. This system is now en-
tirely done away: at the old markets which used to be held seve-
ral days in succession, the day formerly appropriated for the
sale of linen is a blank; all those employed in weaving have,
with scarcely an exception, gone to the villages, and there, at
least in Laurencekirk, by far the greater part work, not at home,
but in public we`ving-shops. The population of the village in-
creased very rapidly from the earlier part of this century, till about
seven years ago, but since that time it has been making less rapid
progress, in consequence of the state of trade, and of the wages
which hand-loom weavers now earn being exceedingly low,--fre-
quently Ss. a-week, by working fifteen or sixteen hours a-day. The
yearly average of births may be stated as about 60, and that of
deaths about 38; that of marriages in which both parties belong
to the parish, 9; and 8 where either party is of a different parish.
	The average number of persons of the following ages may be
stated as under.

	There are only 21 males of fifty years of age or upwards, who
are unmarried, all of them being widowers except 5. There are
about 112 females above forty-five who are unmarried.
	According to the census in 1835, there were 467 families (in-
cluding in that number single individuals living alone,) 366 in the
burgh, and 101 in the country. In the character of childrdn in
these families, i. e. of unmarried persons, of any age, living in the
houses of their parents, there were 625 and 192 respectively, in
burgh and in country, in all, 817. According to this calculation,
the proportion of children to a family, in the burgh is 1.7 to 1, in
the country 1.9 to 1, and over the parish, 1.75 to 1. If we deduct
from the number of families the number of single unmarried
persons, widowed or not living alone, there remain in burgh
272, and in country 83 families, among whom the same number
of children has to be divided, making the proportion 2.3 to 1 in
the burgh, and 2.31 to 1 in the country: and if we deduct farther
