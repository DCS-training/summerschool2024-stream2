Castle.  Of its original purpose and design, however, there is no
certain account to be found.  From the construction of the build-
ing itself, there is reason to believe that it was erected after the
use of fire arms; and, probably, it may have been designed to con-
stitute a protection against the entrance of any hostile force by the
river, and for that purpose to act in concert with the Castle of
Broughty on the opposite shore.  On this point, however, we are
left entirely to conjecture.

                       III.-POPULATION.
       The population of the parish in 1755 was	     621
                                       1796,	     875
                                       1801,         920
                                       1811,        1164
                                       1821,        1461
                                       1831,        1680

Thus showing a gradual and pretty uniform increase during nearly
a century.  The increase may be accounted for partly from the
encouragement given for feuing by the proprietor of Scotscraig,
and partly from the circumstance of the average of births being
greater than that of deaths, as appears from the following averages
for the seven years preceding 1831.

                  deaths,	                     27

The principal part of the population is in the village, which, by the
census of 1831, contained 1538, while there were in the other parts
of the parish only 142.  The number of families was 417, and the
number of inhabited houses 311.  The greater number of the
houses are only one story in heighth, and contain two and sometimes
three apartments.  But there is also a number of two-story houses,
generally containing four apartments, and sometimes the same
number of families.  The houses more recently built, however,
are both more handsome and more commodious.  On many of the
feus taken within the last seven years, very handsome houses have
been erected, and covered with blue slate, by which the appearance

of the village has been greatly improved.
