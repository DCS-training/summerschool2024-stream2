ale only were sold in them.

   Poor.-The decay of smuggling has reduced several fami-
lies, that used to live plentifully, to great poverty, so that the
number of the poor may be expected to increase.  The
number of paupers, supported by the parish funds, has in-
creased from about 12, within these 2 or 3 last years, to 19.
The sum annually expended upon them is about 30 L. which
is procured by the weekly collections at church, and the in-

by their industry, besides their monthly supply from the
funds.  Scarcely any of them beg.

is, upon a little island in Loch Doon, the ruins of an old
castle, which has been built of very large free-stones.  The

easy to conjecture.  There is no quarry nearer than 8 miles,
and the intervening ground is rough and hilly, without any
vestige of a road.  In Loch Braden, one of the sources of
the Girvan, there is also an island, with the remains of a 
castle on it.  There are several vestiges of those cairns, so
frequently met with in Scotland, in the parish of Straiton;
one in particular, which seems to have been a place of great
consequence and solemnity.  It is remarkable, that Sir James
