time past.  The present price is 7 s. per stone, containing 24, lb,
English.  About 100 cows are kept for the purpose of mak-

   Roads and Bridges.-The great road from Glasgow, by
Paisley, to Irvine, Ayr and Port-Patrick, passes through the
town of Berth.  It is much frequented, especially in summer.

is paid in money.  All the roads are well supplied with
bridges, wherever they have been found necessary, There
are no turnpikes in the parish.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The Earl of Eglintoun is Patron.
The stipend paid to the minister, by use and wont, (for there
is no decreet for it,) is 79 bolls of meal, and 17 L. 12 s. 6 d. in
money.  The old glebe, upon which a part of the village now
stands, was exchanged in 1727, by a formal contract between
the Earl of Eglintoun, the presbytery of Irvine, and the in-

upon it; and there is a coat of arms, coarsely done, upon the
