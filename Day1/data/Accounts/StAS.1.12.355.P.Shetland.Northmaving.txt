they be persuaded to keep shepherds, and the shepherd to be
paid out of the flock, it is not to say what an increase might
be in this parish in a few years, as the pastures are very ex-

   The number of ploughs has been decreasing in this parish
for many years.  At this time there are about 26 ploughs;
the ground is mostly digged, or turned up with spades.  The
oats are sown, and the kail and potatoes planted in the month
of April, and from the beginning to the middle of May the
bear-feed is sown.  The harvest is between the first of Sep-
tember and first of November.  The rentalled lands of this
parish amount to 1145 merk land; besides, there are about
100 outsets, or new improvements, commonly estimated at 3
merks each, and pay the landlord accordingly; but are ex-

a small proportion to the hills and pasture grounds.  Every
room or rooms contiguous to each other, are enclosed with
turf-fences.  There is not one farm or house at present unpos-
sessed or uninhabited.

by the landlords for increasing the number of fishers.  In the 
year 1768, the present minister of the parish, upon his first vi-
sitation of families, took a lift of all examinable persons, 
which was obtained with difficulty, owing to the prejudices
of the people.  He found then 1109 examinable persons.  In
the following visitations the number was increasing, and the
