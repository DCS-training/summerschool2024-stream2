   Quarries.-The slate-quarries of Foudland in this parish have
long been in great repute, as producing an excellent quality of
blue slate, large quantities of whiciv were formerly taken to Aber-
deen; but that town has for some years derived its chief supply
from Easdale in Argyleshire, from whence slates being now
brought by sea, free of duty, can be delivered at Aberdeen at full
as low a price as the Foudland slates, which have to pay a heavy
land and canal carriage, the former being at the rate of 14s. per
1000, i. e. 1s. per mile per 1000 (the distance to Inverury being
fourteen miles), the latter 9s. per 1000, or 6d. per mile per 1000, the
distance from Inverury to Aberdeen per canal being eighteen miles.
The average quantity of slates annually taken from these quarries
amounted some years ago, to 900,000, but the present average is
scarcely a half of this; and it is to be feared that the yield will
be still farther diminished, unless some improvement is made in
the mode of working the quarries, either by the application of
machinery, or by clearing away the refuse, and laying bare the
slate beds to a greater depth, much evil having been done by
commencing the quarries too far up the hill, to save trouble and
expense at the outset, and working along the tops of the veins, or,
at all events, not quarrying them to their full depth, and so dis-
posing of the refuse as to increase the difficulty of working them
out to greater depth now.  The prices of slates at the quarry
mouth are as follows: first quality, L.2, 7s. 6d. per 1000; se-
cond quality, L.2 per 1000.  The cost of labour on first is L.1,
10s. per 1000; on second, L.1, 5s. per 1000.  This includes
quarrying, splitting, dressing, &c.  Splitters get 10d. per 100
slates; dressers, 2s. per 100.

   There are two half-yearly markets at Insch; one for cattle, horses,
and grain, the other for the feeing of servants.  Formerly the town
had its weekly market, but that may be said to have ceased many
years since, except that there is a regular supply of butcher-meat
every Friday.
