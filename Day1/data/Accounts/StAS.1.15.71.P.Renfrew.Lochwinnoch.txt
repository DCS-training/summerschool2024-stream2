     of Lochwinnoch.

   Ale-Houses.-In this parish, there are 14 ale-houses, which
should be considerably diminished.  It is to be expected from
some resolutions lately published, that the justices of the peace,
to whose superintendance this material object of police is,
committed by the Legislature, will take this subject seriously
into their consideration, and apply an effectual remedy to an
evil, which is productive of the most pernicious consequen-
ces to the health, the morals, and the industry of the people.

   Population and Employments.-The following table exhi-
bits, at one view, the great increase of the population of this
parish, as well as the various employments of the inhabi-
tants.
