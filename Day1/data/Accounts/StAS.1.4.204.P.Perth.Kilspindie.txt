of one or two farmers.  On one or two more farms, the
number of cottagers has also been diminished.  The num-
ber of souls I found in August 1789 to be 718.  Males
340, females 378.  In one village are 170, and in another

   Average of deaths for 7 years, from December 1783 to
December 1790, is 17 or 18.  Average of marriages, from
1770 to 1780, is 6.  From 1780 to 1790, 8.  Taking the
average of births for the last 7 years, from December 1783
to December 1790, the number is exactly the same as for
the last 5 years, 19 and of burials as above, 17 or 18.
The reason why the average of deaths goes no farther back

to be levied on each burial, etc.  The births mentioned
are not exactly those within the parish; for all the children
that have been baptised here, whether born in it or not,
have their names inrolled in the register here; so also it is

the parties have been proclaimed in two different parishes,
