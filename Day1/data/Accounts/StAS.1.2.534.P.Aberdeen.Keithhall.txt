caused plant several hundreds of geans or black cherries,
which have answered very well.

   Farm-houses and Cottages-These are generally built of
stone and mortar, sometimes with stones, without any co-
ment; and are covered with turf.  Within these five years, a
very few of them have been stob-thatched, or covered with a
deep coat of straw,-and snecked or harled with lime.  None
of the walls are built with lime; nor are any of their roofs co-

than they were, before they got new leases.  They are to get
allowance for their houses, at the end of the lease; but they

parishes.

forze or whins, are used in Kinkell, where they have little
moss, and that of very bad quality.  A few coals are used, in
the estate of Kinmuck, by the farmers:  But only a few; for
they are very dear.  A boll of coals, of 36 stone, costs from
4s to 5 s at Aberden; and the carriage, where carts are hired,
about half that sum; so that, every pound of coal costs more
than half a farthing-Till the tax on coals be taken off, or e-
qualized over the kingdom, the farmers, in the north of Scot-
land, will never succeed in agriculture; because the whole
summer is spent in collecting fuel to their heritors, and them-
selves.  Every proffessor of a plough of land, must cast, and
