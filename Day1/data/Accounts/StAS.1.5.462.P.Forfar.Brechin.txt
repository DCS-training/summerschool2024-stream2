     Statistical Account

   Character.-The people, in general, are active and in-
dustrious, honest in their dealings, and by no means super-
stitious; but cannot be said to be altogether free from
those vices, which generally accompany an influx of
wealth from trade and manufactures.  They are also oc-
casionally infected with a spirit of litigation, and spend
considerable sums at the law, often about mere trisles.-
In public spirit, they are inferior to none.  They are, in
general, of the ordinary stature, from 5 feet, to 5 feet 9 or
10 inches; some near 6 feet, and there is one man several
inches above it.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The low grounds on both
sides of the river are occasionally overflowed by great in-
undations.  The last memorable flood happened in the
year 1774, when the whole bleachfield to the S. E. of the
castle * was overflowed, and the people possessing the te-
nements, which lie along the E. side of the river, were
obliged to go up the highest apartments of their houses,
the under stories being quite overflowed.  There is an
echo at the castle, and another at the cathedral.-There
are neither Jews, Negroes, nor Roman Catholics in the
parish, but some of those sturdy beggars, called gypsies,
occasionally visit it.  No person has been known to die
for want.  Indeed, there is work enough for all who are
able and willing to work, and those who are not able, are
provided for.-There have, therefore, been few or no in-
stances of emigration; only a few left the parish, upon the
failing of the cotton manufactory.-None have been ba-
nished for a considerable time past.  There are very few

*The old mansion house on the side of the river, belonging to Lord
Panmure, who resides in it, is commonly called Castle of Brechin.
It is pleasantly situated in the midst of fine plantation of trees.
