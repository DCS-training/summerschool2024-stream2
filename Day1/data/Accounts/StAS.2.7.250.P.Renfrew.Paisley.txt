a family.  This arises from the number of servants kept by those
employed in agriculture.  The proportion to each family, in an-
other district of the parish, is even greater than this, and is to be
ascribed to the bleachfields in that locality, in which many High-
land girls are employed, who lodge together in large apartments
provided by their masters, and each of these dwelling-places is
reckoned the abode of a single family.
   The yearly average of births recorded for the last seven years
may be stated as follows;

                                Males.   Females.     Total.
      In the Abbey parish,       225        206        431
             Low     do.          34         33         67
             High    do.          75         64        139
             Middle  do.          52         53        105

      In all the parishes,       386        356        742

   But this is no satisfactory proof of the number of births in the
different parishes, many neglecting to register.
   Of 3022, the total number of births recorded in the Abbey pa-
risb, for the last seven years, it appears that 23 are twins, that is,
one in every 66 children registered is at an average a twin.
   Of marriages, the following may be given, as the yearly average
for the last seven years, or rather of proclamations for marriage, for
the marriage is not always celebrated in the parish in which the
parties are proclaimed.

   The aver`ge of deaths cannot be ascertained for the last seven
years, as no regular register of them has been kept during the whole
of that time.  We have, however, been favoured with an excellent
mortality bill, drawn up by Dr M'Kinlay of this town, for the year
ending 31st December 1834, from which it appears, that during
that year there died in the Abbey parish and burgh parishes, in
all 1824.
   In the, Abbey parish, the population may be thus divided.
