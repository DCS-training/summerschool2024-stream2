   Some of the most antient breed of Galloway horses are a-
mong the mountains and less improved parts of the country.
They are laid to be-very hardy, easily maintained, and high
spirited.  This breed is-well attended to in Cumberland,
where it is much improved by crosses with English horses.  A
larger breed is preferred here, as being more fit-for the pur-
poles of draught and agriculture.  Through the attention of
the noblemen and gentry, this neighbourhood has a breed of
horses sit for the saddle, and eariages of every kind.  The
colours of horses are various; but the dark bay, with black
legs and feet, is preferred.  Their shape is generally good.
They were originally galloways, and laid to have sprung
from a Spanish breed, which came ashore on this coast when
one of the vessels of the Armada was wrecked upon it, after
failing round by the Pentland Firth.
