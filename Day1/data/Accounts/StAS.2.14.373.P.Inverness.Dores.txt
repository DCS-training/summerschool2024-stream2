                       PARISH OF DORES.

             PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY.

                 THE REV. DAVID FRASER, MINISTER.

      I-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

Name.-DORES, anciently called Durris, is supposed to be derived
from the compound word, in the Gaelic language, Tur-riish,
which, translated into English, signifies a rising ground near
a water. Such a rising, ground there is in the parish, the sides of
which are washed by Lochness.
  Extent, &c.-The parish is about 20 miles in length, and 3 or
4 in breadth. It is bounded on the east, by the parish of Daviot ;
on the west, by Lochness ; on the north, by the parish of Inverness;
on the south, by Boleskine.
   Topographical Appearances.-The mountains, which inclose the
valley on the north and south, protect it from all winds, except
those from the west and east ; whereby, in hot seasons, the summer
heat is increased so much, that the corn and grass would be
in danger of being quite parched, were it not for the night dews,
that frequently fall in great quantities. In the high ground, there
are several lakes and mountains, to the extent of which the arable
land bears but a very small proportion. The soil, in some  of these,
has greatly the advantage over that of the low ground, and is very
productive, in seasons free from frost,or much rain.
                        II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
Land-owners.-There are seven land-owners in the parish; the
chief of whom are, Lord Lovat, Lady Salton, W. F. Tytler, Esq.
and Thomas Fraser, Esq. of Balrain.
    Mansion-houses.-The chief mansion-houses are those of Aldourie,
Eregie, and Gortleg.
Parochial Register.--Baptism and marriage registers were begun
about the year 1744, but have not been accurately kept.
