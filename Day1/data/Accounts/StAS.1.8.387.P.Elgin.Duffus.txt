that in this comparatively rude part of Britain, the itch,
at present, is less frequent, in proportion to its population,
than in the British capital.  With us, it arises from want of
cleanliness in our persons and clothes; but in London,
confined situation, strong feeding, and a thronged population,
are the co-operating causes.

   Woods.-Upon the south border of this parish, a common
was lately divided by the different proprietors, and planted
with Scotch firs.  Planting here is doubly meritorious, as wood
is needed equally for timber and for fuel.  It may be observed,
that the planting of forest trees is the only branch of improve-
ment, in which our country has of late kept pace with the im-
proving districts of Scotland.  Within the last 25 years, con-
siderable plantations have been made.  In the eastern districts of
the county, Scotch firs chiefly appear, even in many places
where it is presumed the ground would have nourished bet-
ter wood. In the western districts of our county, Scotch firs
have been employed in the plantations, as they ought to be
where the foil and climate require it, merely as nurses in tender
years, to more beautiful and valuable trees, as oak, elm,
ash, etc.

   Orchards.-Buchanan says, "that Moray, for pleasantness, and
the profit arising from fruit trees, surpasses all the other counties
of Scotland." In modern times, we have much neglected this
culture; and our orchards are at present often found about de-
serted castles and religious houses, nearly as much in decay
as the buildings they surround.

   Draining of Lakes.-The art of draining lakes, so as to
render grounds fit for agriculture, seems to be here, as it is
indeed throughout Scotland in general, but in its infancy.
