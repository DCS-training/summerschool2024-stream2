in the parish of Wigton.  The grain produced then, was
of an inferior kind, called grey oats; the ordinary produce
was from 2 1/2 to 3 seeds; and the boll (which consists of
12 bushels) produced generally no more than 8 stone of
meal.  Since the application of manure, the oats have
been improved into the best kind; the produce is from
4 1/2 to 5 seeds, sometimes to 6; and the boll, when made
into meal, rises generally to 12, sometimes to 13, or even
14 stone.  Oats are sown from the 10th of March to the
middle of April, and reaped from the 1st of September
to the middle of October.  No bear was formerly raised
in this parish, except in the borough-acres.  A consider-
able quantity is now sown, especially in the eastern end,
and the produce is from 8 to 10 seeds.  It is sown to-
wards the end of April, and reaped towards the end of
August.  Within these few years, a little wheat has been
raised in the neighbourhood of the town of Wigton.  It
is sown after a green crop, and has been found to answer
well.  The average sowing of the parish, as nearly as can
be ascertained, is that of 500 bolls of oats, and 50 bolls
of bear; and allowing almost the half of the produce of
oats, and about an eighth of the produce of bear, for
seed, and consumption in the farmers families, the rest of
the crop remains to be sold.  A part of that for sale,
especially of the oats, is made into meal, and sold in the
market of Wigton; but the bulk of it is exported to
Whitehaven or Liverpool, to Ayr, Irvine, or Greenock.

   Green Crops.-The method of improvement by green
crops, has as yet made little progress here.  In a few
farms around the town of Wigton, crops of potatoes have,
for some time past, been raised; but the farmers over the
rest of the parish, raise no more than are sufficient for the
