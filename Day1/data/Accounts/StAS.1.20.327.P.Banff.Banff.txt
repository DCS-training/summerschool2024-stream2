commodity of the country. The effect, however, has been
the reverse; grain of all kinds being, for some years past,
in greater demand, and at higher prices, that at any former
period.
   Prior to the year 1754, the practice of winter-herding
was little known.  No sooner was the harvest completed,
than the whole country became one great common, and every
farmer considered he had an undoubted right to pasture his
flocks on his neighbour's fields.  In those days, even the
best farms were generally divided into what is called out-
field and infield; and both were wasted by an injudicious
mode of cropping.  From this torpid state the farmer was
roused by the spirited exertions of the late Earl of Findla-
ter, who happily introduced a new system of farming in
this country.  His Lordship, during his residence in the
Castle of Banff, having taken one of his farms into his own
possession, determined to cultivate it after the most appro-
ved methods then known in the kingdom.  With this
view, he engaged an active and experienced overseer from,
England, to whom he devolved the management of this
farm, and in a few years improved it in a stile and manner
unknown in this country*.
   To conquer the power of habit, and eradicate ancient
prejudices, is often a fruitless attempt, and is a talk pecu-
liarly difficult in effecting agricultural improvements.  Such,
however, was the influence of his Lordship's eminent ex-
ample as a farmer, joined to the judicious encouragement
which he afforded his tenants, that, in a few years, a spirit
of industry and enterprise pervaded all ranks of proprietors
and farmers in this country, and produced a striking im-
provement in the soil and appearance of this parish and
neighbourhood.
