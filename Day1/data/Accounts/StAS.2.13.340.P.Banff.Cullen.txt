  Manufactures.-At one period, manufactures were carried on in
this parish, to a considerable extent.  The patriotic Earl of Find-
later and Seafield, (see Eminent Characters), to whom Baniffshire
has been so largely indebted for his beneficent exertions in the
cause of improvements, introduced this branch of industry in 1748.
His Lordship then presided at the Board of Trustees for Manu-
factures at Edinburgh-an office which afforded him peculiar fa-
cilities for the establishment of manufactures at Cullen; and, ac-
cordingly, under his fostering care, the measure was attended. with
entire success. The writer of the last Statistical Account of the
parish states, "There are in this small place, 65 looms constant-
ly employed in weaving linen, some few of them in weaving, da-
mask.  The manufacturers also give out a great number of webs,
to be woven by country weavers in their own shops.  There are
also seven stocking-looms constantly employed. " Of Cullen, as re-
gards manufactures, it may now be truly said, "non sum qualis
eram;" the busindss as a staple article of trade having altogether
vanished.
  Harbour and Navigation-In 1817, a small but substantial
harbour was erected by the Earl of Seafield; and, in 1834, it was
greatly enlarged and improved, by the erection of an additional
quay, which has rendered it one of the best harbours in the Mo-
ray Frith.  From first to last, the work has cost his Lordship up-
wards of L.10,000. There is a depth of 81/2 feet water at the pier's
head at neap tides, and of 12 feet at spring tides.  There are 4
vessels belonging to the port, of from 40 to 100 tons burthen
each-amounting in all to 270 tons.  The harbour-dues are 2d.
per ton, and yield an annual revenue of L. 70.  The principal im-
ports are, coals, salt, staves, and barley (for distillation).  The
chief exports are, herrings, dried fish, timber, oats, and potatoes.
  Boat-Building, &c.-Boat-building is carried on to a conside-
rable extent in the parish, the abundance of timber grown in the
immediate vicinity, affording ample facilities for the prosecution of
this branch of industry.  The average number of boats built in
the course of the year, may be computed at 44, viz. boats of the
first class, intended for the deep sea and herring-fishery, 36;
