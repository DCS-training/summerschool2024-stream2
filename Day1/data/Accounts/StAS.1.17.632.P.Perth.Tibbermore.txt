     Statistical Account

on the north, the river Almond separates it from the parish
of Redgorton, and a brook called the Pow from that of
Methven; on the west, it is bounded by the parish of Gask,
and on the south, by those of Forteviot land Aberdalgy.  The
surface, without being hilly, is considerably diversified.  To-
wards the west, it exhibits a gentle slope from south to north,
terminating in a narrow track of level ground; and towards
the east, the greater part of the fields being somewhat raised
above the level of the Almond, communicate, by a steep
descent, with a delightful plain along the banks of the river.

accounted unhealthy; and it deserves particular notice, that
here, as well as in the neighbouring parishes, the ague,
which, from time immemorial, had been the most common
disease of the country, has, within these 20 years, complete-

   Acres, Soil, Proprietors, and Cultivation.-The parish con-
tains about 4670 Scotch acres; of these 185 are under
wood; 96 are part of an extensive moss, which furnishes
the surrounding inhabitants with peats for fuel; 100 more
are in the state of uncultivated heath; and the remainder,
about 4289, are all arable ground.
   The cultivated land contains several varieties of soil.  To-
wards the east, upon the banks of the Almond, it is a sandy
loam; near to the town of Perth, somewhat of a clayey
consistence; and upon the higher grounds, more light and
thin, with a gravelly bottom.  Towards the west, the bottom
is rather cold, and generally tilly, which occasions many of
the fields to be wet; but the surface soil is, notwithstanding,
tolerably fertile; and though, in some places, it partakes a
