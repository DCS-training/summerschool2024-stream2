     Statistical Account

   Poor.-At an average for 20 years past, the number of
poor who have received stated or occational supplies are 6.
The annual collections, and the interest of lent money,
amount to L. 10 per annum.  In 1782-3, though the meal 
got up to half-a-crown the stone, yet the poor were compe-
tently supplied, and the other inhabitants lived much in their
usual stile.

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-In 1761, the yearly wages
of a man servant were L. 2:10, of a maid servant L. 1: 10.
In 1790, the former have advanced to L. 8, or L. 8: 10, and
the latter from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum. A labourer's wages are
8 d. and his victuals; a mason's of carpenter's 1 s.; a taylor's
8 d.  There is no stated market here for provisions.  In 1761,
a fat sheep, weighing from 40 to 50 lbs. sold for 7s. or 7 s. 6 d.;
a dozen of eggs for 1 d.; a hen for 4 d; a pound of butter
for 6 d.; a stone of cheese for 3 s.; and a stone of oat meal 
for 1 s.   Now, all these articles, except the last, are nearly
doubled.

   Fuel, Etc.-Peat is the general fuel.  It is scarce in the
southern part; and the poorer sort of people use broom and
furze.  It is plentiful in the middle and eastern parts, and of
the best quality.  The mosses are of difficult access, as no pro-
per roads are opened.  The inhabitants are obliged to carry
home their pear on horse-back in corn sacks, as carts can-
not be used.  There are no turnpike roads in this part of 
Galloway.  The principal road here, which goes along the
river, will be made good by a commutation of the statute la-
bour, at the rate of 15 s. the L. 100 valued rent, which an-
nually produces L. 22 Sterling.

   Antiquities.-Near the church there is an artificial mount,
