with various flowers, and the rude representations of fishes,
beasts, and men on horseback.  On a third is an open cha-
riot drawn by two horses, and some persons in it; behind is
a wild beast devouring an human form lying prostrate on the
earth.  On a fourth is an animal somewhat resembling an
elephant.  On another, 8 feet long, and 3 feet 3 inches broad,
standing upright in a socket, there is a cross.  In the middle
are several figures with the bodies of horses, or camels, and
the head of serpents; on each side of which are wild beasts
and reptiles considerably impaired.  On the reverse is the
figure of a woman, attacked on all sides by dogs and other
furious animals.  Above are several persons on horseback;
with hounds, engaged in the chase.  Below is a centaur, and
a serpent of enormous size fastened on the mouth of a bull.
Accurate drawings of those stones are to be found in Pen-
nant's Tour.  Many other stones, which originally belonged
to this monument, have been carried off, or broken in pieces,
by the inhabitants of this place.  As several of those which
remain have been removed from their proper position; as 
many of the figures are defaced; and as we are, in a great
measure, unacquainted with the art of decyphering hierogly-
phics, the history delineated on Vanora's monument is now
irrecoverably soft.  The antiquary may amuse himself with
the fragments which remain; but he can scarcely form one
plausible conjecture with respect to their original meaning
and design.  The fabulous Boece records a tradition prevail-
ing in his time, viz that, if a young woman shall walk over
the grave of Vanora, she shall entail on herself perpetual ste-
rility.  But, whatever apprehensions of this nature the fair
sex in his time might have entertained, the most credulous
are not now affraid of making the experiment.
