cords of 3d December 1671 will warrant an inference in favour
of the improved state of the parish. It is curious, however, and as
such we give it. "Given to ye sklatter, Patrick Thomson,
for sklatting a part, and pointing another part of the church, 4
lib.; to his servant for drink money 3 B. 4d. And spent with him
in drink 6 B. 8d.; for nails 15 B.; sum of all the particular pro-
ceedings 5 lib. 5 B."
   In the absence of authentic sources of information, we cannot
speak decidedly, yet we think it may be confidently presumed
that a progressive improvement in the moral and religious charac-
ter of the people must have accompanied the faithful and devoted
exertions of their late pastor, who, for so many years, ministered
among them. To testify their sense of his worth, and their value
of his services, an elegant obelisk, with a just tribute to his me-
mory inscribed, has been erected by the parishioners of Dirle-
ton.
