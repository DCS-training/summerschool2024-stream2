   Sheep and Wool.-Our farmers do not breed many sheep.
This is owing to the nature of the soil, which often produces
that baneful disease, well known by the name of the rot.  The
greatest proportion is consequently bought in, and fed off.
The lambs are generally sold in the months of June, July,
and August, and the ewes about Michaelmas and Martinmas.
The wool of these sheep is not very valuable, as they are ge-
nerally bought in from mountainous counties, such as Tweed-
dale and Lammermuir.  Such wool sells from 10 s. to 12 s. per
stone.  As for the sheep purchased from Northumberland and
Bishoprick, they are of a very superior kind.  The wool of
that staple generally sells from 18 s. to one guinea per stone,
and the carcase weighs from 70 lb. to 80 lb.  There are only
2 farmers in the parish who are breeders of sheep; which
turn out to great account.  The sheep which they breed, are
equal to any bred in Northumberland, both for weight and
fineness of fleece; and, as a proof of this, 100 lambs, with
the wool of the ewes, were sold for 100 guineas; and a con-
siderable profit was made of them, both by the butcher and
manufacturer.

   Union of Farms.-About 25 or 30 years ago, the farms in
the parish of Eccles were very small, and several gentlemen

tity of land laid off in the best order, both for breeding and feeding.
