in any considerable quantity, is in general cultivated with at-

   Means of cultivation.-The means of cultivation are here
obtained with little difficulty.  The stables and streets of the
town afford a regular supply of manure; but what is collected
from the streets is less valuable, on account of a mixture of
sand which it receives from the houses of the ordinary class of
inhabitants, whose floors are frequently covered with it.-
Lime is to be had at a short distance, and at a moderate ex-

on the lands lying nearest to the town; in the idea that the
soil is too light and warm to permit it to be used with safety.
Sea-weeds furnish an occasional accession of valuable manure,
but in a quantity that bears no proportion to the extensive de-
mand for it.

   Improvements in Husbandry.-The mode of culture has of
late undergone some important alterations.  The tillage is
improved; to which drilling and hoeing, now much used in
all crops, have not a little contributed.  Green crops are in-
troduced; and the proportion of land employed in them is
every year increasing.  The rotation of crops is better regu-

crops being pretty generally attended to.  The implements of
husbandry are improved; particularly the plough.  Of this
valuable instrument, two kinds are employed; the common
Scotch plough, which begins to be better constructed than
formerly, and the chain-plough introduced by Small of Black

24 ploughs used in the parish, 17 are of this kind, and 7 of
the other.  The ploughs are all drawn by horses, generally
