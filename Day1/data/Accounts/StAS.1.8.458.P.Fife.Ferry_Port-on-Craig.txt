is 4 miles farther eastward, and nearer the ocean and mouth
of the river, than the passage at Dundee.  It is private pro-

   Situation, Surface, Village, etc.-This parish is situated on
the South side of the river Tay, and stretches along the South
bank of the river, from its mouth, where it empties itself
into the German ocean, 5 statute reties from E. to W.  It is
irregular as to its breadth from N. to S., being in Some places

On the E. the Surface is flat and low.  Though there are no

rocky, where the hills have not soil enough for cultivation.

(where the family resides), four farms, with their cottaries,
and the village of Ferry-Port-on-Craig, from whence the
parish has its name.  The greatest number of the parishioners
live in the Ferry, where the church and manse are both situ-
ated, and are very centrical for the parishioners.

to produce the greatest profit, are, wheat, beans, barley,
grass, and oats.  Flax is sown to very good advantage; but,
on the whole, it is rather an uncertain crop; it likewise pro-
