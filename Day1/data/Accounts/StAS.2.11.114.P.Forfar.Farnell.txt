money, amounting in all to L.500,1 for which the heritor gives five
per cent.; the rest being made up by church collections and liberal
donations received from time to time from the heritor and his lady.
Besides those supported by the session-funds, there are several
who have free houses, pensions, or other privileges; so that, upon
the whole, the condition of the poor in this parish is rather un-
usually comfortable. There are still occasional and very decided
manifestations of an unwillingness to receive parochial relief; but
that spirit is here, as elsewhere, visibly on the decline.
   Inns.--In this parish there is neithdr an inn nor an alehouse,
nor is the want of them regretted by any.
   Fuel.--Coals are the fuel chiefly in use. They are brought
from Montrose, or from a, barbour on the west side of the basin at
Old Montrose, by which two miles of land-carriage are saved.
Decayed wood and loppings of trees, which are sold publicly from
time to time, and at a moderate rate, are found very serviceable
in this respect.

of the poor.
