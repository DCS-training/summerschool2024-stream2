   The constant shifting of farm-servants is a great bar in the
way of external improvement, with one class of cottages: and even
in another class more permanently occupied, the indifferent state
of many of the houses, both internally and externally, affords but
little encouragement to the cottager to adorn his dwelling. On
some of the estates, however, the cottages begin to be better con-
structed, and might be beautified at small cost and pains, by the
planting of a few shrubs and flowers, by laying a little pavement
near the door, and by removing the dung heap a little farther from
it. In their manners, the people ar peaceable, obliging, and con-
tented.

                    IV.-INDUSTRY.
   The inhabitants of the parish are, for the most part, en-
gaged in farming occupations. Besides the few who are em-
ployed in weaving and quarrying, there are just so many car-
penters, nasons, smiths, tailors, and shoemakers as are necessary
to supply the local demand. There are four meal and barley-
mills within the bounds of the parish, driven by water. All the
large farms have thrashinf-lills, so that there is very little work
done with the flail. The farmers, who are, as a body, a most re-
spectable and intelligent class of men, rear considerable stocks of
cattle; and some of them export largely to the London market
both of cattle and potatoes. Bondage, or the obligation to assist
in the field-work of the farmer on whose land the cottager has his
dwelling, still exists here to a certain extent.
