                        PARISH OF NEWTON-UPON-AYR

                       PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

                     THE REV. JAMES STEVENSON, A. M. MINISTER.


                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        Name, Boundaries, &c.-The name of this parish is evidently
derived from its situation on the banks of the Ayr, and the town's
being founded at a later period than the adjacent county town.
In the characters granted to the burgh, it is called Nova villa super
Air, and sometimes Nova villa de Air. The same name was given
originally to the town of Ayr; but when another town arose on the
north side of the river, the name became appropriated to it, as be-
ing the more modern.
	The parish is of very small extent: being only a mile and a
half in length, and a mile in its greatest breadth. It is bounded
on the north by the parish of Prestwick; on the east by the pa-
rishes of St Quivox and Wallacetown on the south by the river
Ayr, separating it from the town and parish of Ayr; and on the
west by the Frith of Clyde. The figure of the parish is oblong;
being broadest about the middle, and narrowing at the northern
and southern extremities. It is level throughout its whole extent,
without any eminence to diversify the landscape. The whole
length of the parish is washed by the Frith of Clyde. The coast
is flat and sandy, terminating, however, at the north-west corner
of the parish in an inconsiderable rocky point, which projects a
little way into the sea.
        Meteorology.-A daily register of the winds having been kept
for a long period at Cowan and Sloan's Office, agent for Lloyd's.
we are enabled to present the following table of them for the years
1820, 1825, 1830, 1825, and 1836. We content ourselves with
giving the annual results for the four former years; but subjoin
the prevailing winds for each month of 1836:-
