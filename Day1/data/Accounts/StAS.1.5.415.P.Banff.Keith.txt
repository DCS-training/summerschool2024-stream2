9 miles from any shore.  It is situated about the middle of
the county of Banff, in the presbytery of Strathbogie and
Synod of Murray.  It is about 6 miles long, and as many
broad, being nearly circular.  Supposing the church the centre,
a radius of about 3 miles would almost deecribe it.  It lies
in the middle of a large strath, called Strath-Isla, or Stryla,
from the water of Isla that runs through it; and contains a
tract of as close, extensive, and fertile a field of arable
ground, as is to be found in any strath in the north.

   Soil, Produce, Minerals, etc.-The prevailing soil is
loam and clay; the rest of it is light.  It is in general fertile
in its productions, though, on account of its depth and moi-
sture, it is commonly late in bringing them to maturity.
For, though the oat feed-time begins generally about the
end of March, and the barley feed-time about the end of 
April; harvest seldom commences before the end of Au-
gust or beginning of September.  At present, the parish is 
entirely destitute of trees, except a few ashes and elms in 
country gardens; nor are any of its surrounding hills
planted, but the hill of Mildary, belonging to Lord Find-
later, where the planting is in a thriving way.  Its gene-
ral produce in grain, is oats, barley and pease.  The first
is the prevailing crop; but what quantity may be raised,
or what proportions the different species of grain bear to
each other, cannot easily be ascertained.  Wheat has been
seldom tried, though with one farmer, before 1782, (since
which the seasons have generally been wet, late and cold,)
it prospered well, for he reaped 22 returns.  Almost e-
very tenant has annually a plot of ground under flax,
but seldom above an acre; except on gentleman, survey-
or for the trustees, who has annually from 16 to 18 acres
under flax, and seems to be perfectly master of its whole
economy.  In general, it is a thriving and profitable crop,
