   Produce of Land in Agriculture and Pasturage, etc.-The
land in this parish is well suited for both.  The farmers
raise excellent crops of oats, barley and bear, from the im-
proved land.  There is little wheat, pease or rye sown, as
they are not deemed so suitable for the soil.  As the soil is
thin, they find wheat is a great impoverisher.  They plant
great quantities of potatoes, in the drill form, which thrive
well, and make ample returns to them for their labour.
Excellent crops of barley and bear are raised from the po-
tato ground the ensuing season.  Good crops of rye grass
and clover are raised, when the improved land is laid out
for pasture.  There is no fixed rotation of crops observed
by the farmers, but every one varies his practice, according
to his particular taste, and the nature of the soil.  There
are considerable quantities of natural meadow ground in
different places, particularly on each side of the water of
Tarff, and great quantities of meadow hay are produced
from them every year.  The hay on the Tarff is reckoned
of an inferior quality, from being much sanded by fre-
quent inundation, in rainy summers.  When it is cut,
great quantities of it are carried down the water by sudden
falls of rain.  There is little flax produced, except what
the farmers make use of for their families; many parts,
however, are well suited for this article.  The farmers
breed a considerable number of young cattle every year.
The late improvement of the land has greatly improved
their pasture grounds, which enables them to keep more
cows, and to feed them better.  Their young cattle thrive
well in general, and numbers keep them out in the fields
in winter before they are a year old, and feed them with
straw and hay.  Their cattle are of the Galloway kind,
