souring, must follow the same rules that that painter does,
who pursues the only road to fame,ú in a similar species of
composition.  If it is nature that is to be represented, either
on paper or canvas, and a true likeness given the must fit for
her picture.  In this case no violation of custom or incongrui-
ty can ever take place.  All Shenstone's inscriptions, and
many of his other poems, are mere expressions of the feel-
ing excited by the scenes among which he lived, and in
which he delighted; and in this view, as containing the ori-

in the water of Glencrofs, to a spot which has nothing pecu-
liar in itself or neighbourhood; which is away from all inha-
bitants, bare, and surrounded with marshes; where there is
scarcely, a birch, or shrub, unless stinted solitary thorn, or
