   Iron Mines.-In the banks of Calder-water, which divides
this parish from Kilbride, there has, of late, been discovered,
a vast quantity of iron stone, of an excellent quality, which is
now wrought to great extent.  Many different seams of it ap-
pear on the face of the banks, at the distance of a few feet
from each other : and the seams are usually about 6 or 7 in-
ches thick.  The stone is dug out, by mines driven forward
into the bank.  It is carried to the distance of about 7 miles, to
a furnace erected near Glasgow, and converted into pig iron.
The iron company usually pay the proprietors of the land, at
the rate of 6 d per ton, for the iron stone; besides making
compensation for any damages that may be done in dig-
ging.

   Figured Stones.-Many of these iron stones appear to retain
the original shape of the wood, from which, according to the
opinion of some naturalists they have been formed.  Some of
them retain the original form of the branch of an exotic pine;
and have rows of small protuberances winding round them, in
an oblique direction; and some of them are covered with spines.
Besides the stones, which retain the original shape of the wood,
there are others, that are only marked with the impressions of
the bark.  These impressions are mostly chequered, some on
a level, and others on a concave surface, answerable to the con-
vexity of the original trunk of branch; and these impressions
on the iron stone are sometimes very perfect.

   Population.-The state of the parish, with respect to popula-
tion, as far as can be traced back, seems to have been nearly,
for many years, the same.  The return to Dr. Webster, in
1755, was 496 souls.  But in 1787, the number of inhabi-
tants was immediately and greatly increased, by means of a
cotton mill erected upon the Clyde.  Before that period, the
