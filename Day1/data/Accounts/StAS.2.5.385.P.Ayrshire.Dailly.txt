tire than the outer. Neither of them extends the whole way
round, the ground being particularly steep for about 50 yards on
the face of the hill. The encampment commands a magnificent
view, particularly of the Island of Arran; and Turnberry Castle, in
the parish of Kirkoswald, lies directly before it towards the north.
It may therefore have been connected with the plans or move-
ments of Robert Bruce.
	On the 5th July 1836, a day which will be long remembered
for the length and the violence of the thunder storm which raged.
over all the lowlands of Scotland, the lightning struck upon this
hill in two different places, not far from the encampment. The
fissures which it made are somewhat zig-zag, deeper at one extre-
mitythan anyfurrow of a plough,and extending about seven or eight
yards. The ground below has the feeling of a collection of ashes.
At Old Dailly, in a very sweet spot, are the ruins of the old parish
church, which was left in 1696 for the more centrical situation
which thd church now occupies.
	Modern Buildings.--The buildings in the parish, besides those
already mentioned, are two flour-mills, which go by water, two
saw-mills, under wooden erections at the two collieries, impelled
by the steam-engines there, a third saw-mill, in a different quarter,
driven by water, and a brick-work connected with the colliery at
Dalquharran.

			III.--POPULATION.
		In 1801 the population was	1621
		   1811,			1756
	      	   1821,			2161
		   1831,			2074

	The decrease of the population since the census in 1831 is pro-
bably to be ascribed to the discontinuance of the extensive im-
provements which were for some time carried on by the landed
proprietors. Emigration has not prevailed much in this neigh-
bourhood but is upon the increase.
