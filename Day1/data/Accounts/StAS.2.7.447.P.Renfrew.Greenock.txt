The decline in the coasting-trade and in the fishing vessels,
which appears from this comparative view, may b.e ascribed chiefly
to the same causes namely, the deepening of the river, and 'the
transference of these branches of trade to Glasgow.  The success
of the river trustees in their improvements has begun to injure the
foreign trade of Greenock, though 'not to so' great an extent as
might have been anticipated. There are persons living who have
forded ther Clyde on horseback below the Broomielaw at ebb-tide
now the river steamers can sail at all hours, and some ships of the
'largest class can pass at full tide, and lade and unlad at the port of
Glasgow.* With such facilities for the transit of goods to Glasgow,_
in consequence of these improvements and the towing of vessels by
iteam, it were unreasonable to expect that either the coasting or
foreign trade of Greenock should continue as great as formerly.
That the latter has suffered so little, as will appearfrom a re-'
port from the Custom-House, about to be laid before the reader,
can only be accounted for by the growing prosperity of the coun-
try at large, and the encour . agement which is thus given to trade
in all parts of Scotland.
Before giving this report, we may present another criterion of
the state of trade at Greenock at different periods :

In 1783, the revenue from the harbour was                       L-111    4  8

The average revenue for six years ending 5th January 1809 was   3,547   19  8

    The progressive increase of the harbour revenue is the result
not only of the increase of the trade, but of the improvements
which havebeen made under the authority of successive acts of
Parliament,particularly of the extension of the harbour. the build-
ing of new quays and warehouses, and of dry docks for graving
and repairing vessels. These improvements, suggested by the
growing commerce of Greenock, and executed at an emmense ex-

Glasgow of the British Association by Mr Bald, civil engineer, stating the mean
rise and fall of the tide in the harbour at Glasgow, at 6 feet 9 inches, while in 1755,
Smeaton stated the tide to be only sensible at Glasgow Bridge.
