   In the lower parts of this parish, hares and partridges
abound.  And about the latter end of autumn, a vast
number and variety of water-fowl, particularly the wild
duck, and the different species of teals, repair to the lakes
before mentioned, and there continue to gather occasi-
onally the gleanings of the neighbouring corn fields, till
these fields are covered with snow, or bound up with frost.
Then they depend for subsistence on the open lakes, marshes,
and springs.  And when these are all shut up except a few
powerful springs, they betake themselves to the open rivers,
and there continue till the increasing frosts drive them, e-
maciated, back to the sea shores.  A few of them remain
here over winter, and hatch in the spring season.  The
wood-cock, also, who visits us about the middle or end of
October, feeds in our woods till the winter frosts set in, when
he cannot, with his feet or bill, turn over the fallen leaves:
Then he takes to the woods and thickets where springs most
abound; and when the frosts have long continued very in-
tense, instigated by necessity, he wings his way to more sou-
thern climes, where the loose lying leaves of the woods, and
the open marshes and springs, admit his long tender bill,
and invite him to pick up, and suck from their open shores,
the scanty pittance of food which he demands.  He revisits
us about the middle of February, on his way to a more nor-
thern climate, where he fixes his place for propagating his
species.-But why repair to these northern climates to pro-
pagate thy species?  Do the Norwegian woods afford thy
tender young ones a more plentiful supply of food, and eve-
ry other thing suited to their nature, than could be found in
more southern climates?  In these northern climates, is the
year far advanced before the snows are dissolved?  Does the
dissolution of the snows and frosts afford plenty of springs,
and moisture in the woods?  If thou delightest in the small
