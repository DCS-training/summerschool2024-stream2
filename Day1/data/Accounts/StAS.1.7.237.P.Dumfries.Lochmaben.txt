The pike, which is the tyrant of the lake, destroy, many of
them.  We have heard of a fresh water herring in Lochlo-
mond, it might be worth while to enquire, whether they are
the same with our Vendises.  They have the mark of heart
on the crown of the head.
   The castle stands upon a peninsula of the loch, and is by
far the largest and strongest of any, either on the English or
Scotch borders, next to Carlifle, against which it was a frontier
garrison.  It was built by Robert Bruce, the first of that
name king of Scotland.  The original castle occupies about
an acre of ground, and contains three courts, strongly built
of stone and lime.  The walls are twelve feet thick.  It was
surrounded by three deep fosses, each of which was filled

whole fortification may contain 13 acres.  The inner fossee
went through the castle, within which there was a bason for
holding the boats, to place them out of the reach of the ene-
my, and to shelter them from the weather.  The principal
entry to the castle seems to have been by water.  It has been
a very strong places and, before the invention of cannon,
might be said to be impregnable.  Even in the present state
of fortification, it might be made a place of strength, as it is
surrounded by water and marshy ground for a miles and only
a narrow neck of land for the entry.  Before the union of
the Crowns, a garrison of 200 men was constantly kept in
it.  Among the titles of the Marquis of Annandale, he
assumes that of Constable, or Hereditary Keeper of the
Castle of Lochmaben.  The governor had a salary of 300 L.
Scotch, (a considerable sum, it is supposed, in those days), along

the foresaid charter, granted in the year 1612, gives the fish-
ing of all the lochs to the borough of Lochmaben, yet the
proprietors of the Castle have always enjoyed the property,
