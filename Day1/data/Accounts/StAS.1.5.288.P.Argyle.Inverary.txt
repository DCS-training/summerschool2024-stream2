near the town, remarkable for its smoothness.  From Ao-
reidh, is derived Glenao-reidh, the valley through which
the river passes, and Ionar-ao reidh, the sla ground on
both sides the mouth on the river.  It is probable, that
agriculture was first attempted on such fertile spots as were
thus situated.  The name universally given in Gaelic to
such pieces of ground, favours this idea.  Ion-ar (or Inver)
means, worthy of tillage, from Ion, deserving of, and Ar,

fertile ground at the mouth of a rapid rough river; or,
Aorath, may signify unlucky, from the frequent accidental
drownings, which may be supposed to have happened in a

flowed in a very short space of time, an instance of which
happened on the 3 d of August 1792, when, in consequence
of a high flood, salmon and trout were caught on the very

   Situation, Extent, Fuel, etc.-Inveraray is the capital of
Argyleshire, and near it is one of the seats of the noble
family of Argyle.  It is pleasantly situated on the side
of Lochsyne, in the presbytery of Inveraray, and provin-
cial Synod of Argyle.  The length of the parish from
North to South is about 17 miles; its breadth is va-
rious but above 3 miles at an average, and its form
nearly a crescent.  Its appearance is hilly, and even
mountainous, though interspersed with several tracts of
flat land, particularly about Inveraray, and the whole of
Glenshire, which is in length about 5 English miles.  A
considerable part of the high lands in the parish may be
called good pasture, particularly Benbuie, where there is
at present one of the best and largest sheep flocks in the
Highlands; but the greater proportion of the hills may be
called barren.  The whole Glenshira, and several fields
