five tenants, and five householders.  To these the kirk session
are added.  The poor are subdivided into classes, each class
being under the inspection of an overseer.  None can be re-
ceived upon the poor's list, unless they make a disposition of
their effects, to be sold after their decease, for the benefit of
the poor:  Any two overseers can draw upon the treasurer, for
occasional relief, either to those upon the list, when unfor-
seen distresses come upon them, or to those who are not upon
the list; but whose situation may require a temporary relief.

   Deaths.-The account of deaths has not been accurately
kept; only I noticed, that in the year 1790, they were 82;
but I dare say, more than one third of them came from the
towns of johnston and Quarrelton.

   Agriculture.-In giving an account of the agriculture of
this parish, we must distinguish between the high and rocky
division, and the low anti level part, as in each of these the
practice differs in several particulars.

<FOOTNOTE>

^Since the year 1786, when the Relief Meeting took place, the baptisms
have decreased, as very few of that society, or of the burghers, register their
children.  But from the proportion of baptisms to marriages, I think their
should be, at an average, between 90 and 100 births yearly.
