upwards of 30 that receive occasionally.  The ordinary col-
lections at the church, amount to L. 30 per annum.  Particu-
lar collections are sometimes made for special exigencies; and,
upon such occasions, the people are very liberal.

   General State.-The valuation of the parish, in the coun-
ty books, is about 13,000 merks.  The present rents of the
landward part, including the parks and pasture about the vil-
lage, amount to L. 3300 sterling.  The rents of the houses, in
and about the village, cannot be exactly ascertained:  Many
houses are possessed by the proprietors; but estimating the
rents of them proportionally, with the houses that are posses-
sed by tenants, we may state the whole rents of the village, at
L. 600.  Total L. 3900.
   Half the parish belongs to the Marquis of Annandale, and
to the Earl of Hopetoun.  There are 11 or 12 other heritors,
only one of whom resides in it.-There are many feuers in the
village.
   The parish has never been measured.  A few parks near the
village, and some individual farms, have been surveyed, but
no map has been made of the whole district, nor is it easy to
estimate what its contents may be.
