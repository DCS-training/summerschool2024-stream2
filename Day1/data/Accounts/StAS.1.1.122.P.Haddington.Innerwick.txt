plough-gates* and a half in the parish.  Both English and
Scottish ploughs are used.  The hilly part of the parish is em-
ployed chiefly in pasturing sheep and milk cows.  Some black
cattle are fed for the market on pasture.  The common, which
was lately divided, consisted of 1900 acres.  Scarcely any flax
is raised for sale.  Wheat and barley are the principal grains.
The lands on the coast are earlier than any other in the
country, the harvest being concluded there about the end of
September, and frequently sooner.  In 1779, it was finished,
by the 12th of September.  The parish produces more corn,
and cattle fed on turnip, than is sufficient to supply its inha-
bitants.  Farms are in general large, and increasing in size.
There are many inclosures, but little planting, at least very
few old trees.  The residing heritors have begun to plant of
late.  One of them has planted 120 acres of common, of
healthy ground.  The rent of the parish is about L.4000
Sterling at present, but will probably soon be considerably
advanced.  The old valuation is L. 9215 Scots.  Land in
this part of the country let formerly, at an average, at
L . 1: 11: 6; but, according to the new leafes, at L. 2: 10: 0
per acre.  There is sea-weed in great abundance; to which,
rather than the natural richness of the soil, the high price of
land on the coast must be attributed.  There is, at an average,
perhaps 25 or 30 ton of kelp made in a year.  In 1782, the
crop was very scanty and late.  Seed-time was not finished
till about the beginning of June, nor harvest till about the
10th or 15th of November.  Tradesmen, having meal to buy,
were then in a much worse situation than the greatest part of
the servants employed in husbandry.

one plough.
