   Note 2d.  Seeing there is manifestly a very considerable
increase of population in Scotland these 40 years past, and
the number of adventurers is very great during the same pe-
riod, into England, the army, and navy, the continent,
the coast of Africa, the East and West Indies, and Ameri-
ca; therefore it will be proper to place them in a ratio of
equality.
   Again, from these data, to find the amount of the popula-
tion of Scotland, anno 1792, that is, the increase of popula-
tion in 37 years, from the year 1755.  See note 3.
   As every addition to the number of inhabitants, from the
excess of the births above the deaths, produces a proportion-
ably greater number of births; an increasing population will
exactly resemble the accumulation of money at compound
interest, where PR+ = S the amount.  Therefore let the

be about 43 years ago, anno 1749, yet as he had every in-
ducement to make the population of Scotland rather large
than otherwise, that his native country might appear, in the
eyes of governments in as favourable and respectable a light as
