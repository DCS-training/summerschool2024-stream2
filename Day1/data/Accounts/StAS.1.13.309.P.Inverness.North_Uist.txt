   State of Property.-Lord Macdonald is sole proprietor
of this parish, and his predecessors have been in possession
of it for several centuries back.  He is the representative
of the Earls of Ross, whose history is well known, and
who in point of power and antiquity, yielded to none of
the Scots barons.  The rents in the year 1763, including 
kelp-shores, amounted to upwards of L. 1200.  In 1771,
they amounted to L. 1800, including kelp-shores.  The
present land-rents amount to L. 2100, besides the profits
arising from the sale of 800 tons kelp, the amount of 
which cannot be ascertained, on account of the fluctuating 
state of price of that article.  The tenants may be di-
vided into 2 classes:  1 ft, The gentlemen farmers or tacks-
men, who posses one or more farms each; and, 2dly, The 
small tenants, a number of whom live together in a farm,
according to the value and extent of it.  The division of 
tenants into these two classes is not peculiar to this parish,
but extends to all the western islands, and the adjacent
parts of the continent.  The first of these classes, name-
ly, the gentlemen farmers, are for the most part the de-
scendents of the different branches of the families of the 
chieftains, on whose estate they live.  Of old, when the 
chieftains lived upon their own estates, and had no encou-
ragement to send their younger sons as adventurers to a 
foreign land, they planted them about them upon their own 
properties, and gave them portions of lands for small year-
ly rents, which were continued with their descendents from
one generation to another.  At the expiration of one
lease, another was granted nearly upon the same terms*.

*The chieftain prided himself upon the number of his gentlemen so
much, that he looked upon himself as their common father.  In their
distress he relieved their wants, and when one of them died, he became
