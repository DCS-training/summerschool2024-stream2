     The Statistical Account

   In perusing the foregoing table, it is impossible to avoid
remarking the different proportions the real rent bears to
the valued rent in different counties; a circumstance owing
to the valuation of some counties having been taken at later
periods than that of others; to improvements in agriculture;
and to the introduction of manufactures.  In the manufactur-
ing county of Dunbarton the real rent is more than twelve
times, and of Renfrew more than eleven times the valued
rent, while in the pastoral counties of Roxburgh and Sel-
kirk, the real rent is not much above four times the valued
rent.  But a discussion of these particulars belongs properly
to the Analysis of the Statistical Account of Scotland, which
the Author hopes he will have leisure to complete in the
course of the present year.

   In the tables of the population of Scotland, Vol. xx, p.
599, the number of inhabitants in Dumfries parish was by
mistake stated at 5600, the number in the town, instead of
7000, the number in town and country.  The state of Dum-
frieshire with respect to population will therefore stand
thus:

   While these sheets were in the press, a letter was receiv-
ed from the Rev. Mr Alexander Stewart, the very intelligent
minster of Moulin, dated 21. January 1799, stating, that
"by an exact survey of the population of the parish, finish-
