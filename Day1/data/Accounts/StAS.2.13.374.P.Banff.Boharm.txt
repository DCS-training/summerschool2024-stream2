               In this parish, the spirit of improvement awakened, about forty
             years ago, by David M'Dowal Grant, Esq., husband of the late
             proprietrix of Arnidilly, and much encouraged by him during the
             continuance of his connection with the property, has since accom-
             plished much, particularly since 1808, when the country was open-
             ed by turnpike roads. Patrick Steuart, Esq. of Auchlunkart
             commenced a very spirited course as an improver soon after his
             succession to the estate in 1800, and has since persevered with
             most praiseworthy energy `nd most profitable success. A consi-
             derable deal has also been done on the Seafield property, and
             much is in immediate contemplation. Throughout the parish,
             the old arable fields have been much dried by ditches and drains,
             and, having been freed of unsightly baulks and bogs, have been
             properly laid together, limed, and brought under a regular rota-
             tion. The swampy bottoms of the valleys have been drained, and
             are now almost entirely converted into productive lands, and many
             acres of moor ground have been reclaimed, partly by the plough,
             and partly by trenching, which is considered the preferable mode,
             and is found, on the whole, not more expensive.
               In such a report as this, the fact surely deserves a place, that
             Mr Steuart, succeeding to an arable extent in this parish of 812
             Scotch acres, has, besides all his plantations already noticed, ad-
             ded to that extent, either by his own direct operations or by his
             tenantry, the extent of 300 Scotch acres, and has 120 more, at
             this present time, in course of improvement; so that, in the course
             of two or three years hence, the total number of arable Scotch
             acres on the estate of Auchlunkart in this parish will be advanced
             from 812 to 1232. Mr Steuart has been equally energetic and
             successful in the other parishes into which his property extends.
