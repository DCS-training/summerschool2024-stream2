river.  A thriving hedge, and some thriving young trees,
were crushed to the ground.

   Eels.-A great number of young eels, of the common
species, make an annual procession up this river, which
may be classed among those wonders with which nature
abounds.  Impressed with the ideas which this phonome-
non at first excited, I beg leave to give a short account of
it.  The time of their appearing varies according to the
nature of the season, and the state of the river.  It is sel-
dom earlier than the middle of May, nor later than the
middle of June.  About 15 years ago, when I first observed
them, they came in the first week of June; there was then
some flood in the river, and the eels kept near to the bank,
and near the surface of the water.  They proceeded in re-
gular rows, close to each other, and 7 eels in a row.  The
arrangement and movement of the whole seemed to re-

continued running three days.  They were most numerous
the first day; fewer, almost by one half, the second; and
on the third day, they came up only in a straggling man-
ner.  They were 9 inches long, and 3-4ths of an inch
round.
   This year, (1794), the season being mild, and the river
low, the eels made their appearance 15th May; but they
were not above half the size of the former, and less regu-
lar in their ranking and moving.  They continued to run
four days, with some intermission on the 16th and 17th,
but very numerous towards the evening of the 18th May.
Many of them kept near to the edge of the river, especially
where there is a rapid current; but several seemed to be
scattered all over the breadth of the river: For this year I
observed more go up the burn of Culter than I could dis-
