got leases of their farms to themselves and their heirs, for
2, 3, or 4 19 years, they could not only afford to pay the
present rent, which distresses them, but live comfortably,
and at the same time improve their farms, render them far
more valuable to the proprietor and his family, and pre-
vent the disagreeable necessity of frequent sequestrations for
rents.  As to the obstacle of improvement, arising from the
time necessarily taken up in providing and bringing home
their fuel, it is hoped, that the laudable and useful step taken
by the Legislature in abolishing the duty upon coals carried
coastways, will be productive of the happier consequences.
Were all such obstacles to the improvement of the country,
and other bars to industry, which impolitic laws throw into
the way, removed, our country bids fair to advance in im-
provement, with a rapidity hitherto unknown.

   Millstone Quarries.-There are two millstone quarries in
the parish, one belonging to the Earl of Aberdeen, in the
land of Auchmedden, in the face of a very high rock over-
looking the sea, and whose foot is washed by it at full tide;
to this quarry, the workmen, from a tremendous height, de-
scend by a kind of stair cut out of the rock, and where this
fails, by ladders reaching from one shelf of the rock to
another.  When the millstones are finished; they are push-
ed over the remaining precipice, and fall at the foot of the
rock, on a small sandy beach dry at low-water, but covered
by the tide when it flows.  From this the millstones are con-
veyed by sea, and landed at the mouth of the burn of Troup,
the west boundary of the parish.  The other millstone quarry
is also close by the sea, upon the lands of Coburty, belong-
ing to Mr. Gordon of Aberdour, but is now neglected.  And
all along the coast is found a kind of red freestone.
