the parish of Scoonie, on the N. by Ceres, on the E. by
Newburn, and on the S. by Largo Bay.  It is of an irre-

Its breadth is very unequal.  The area of the whole con-

parish must afford a picturesque and delightful scene of ele-

northern parts in general are of a thin black mould, on a
wet bottom; in the southern, of a black loam, partly on a
dry, and partly on a wet bottom, interspersed with fields
of light land.  Rich breaking clay is peculiar to the S. E.
part of the parish, and there are some tracks in different
directions, to the westward of the hill, consisting of clays
