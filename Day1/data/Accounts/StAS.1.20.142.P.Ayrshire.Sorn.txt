the most part, of the black kind.  In some places, however,
it is reddish, particularly in Aird's moss; the west or lower
end of which begins in the south side of this parish, and runs
up through it, and the parish of Auchinleck, to the distance
of 8 or 9 miles.  The moors and mosses produce little but
heath, bent, sprits, and rushes.  In several places, however,
the soil, which yields these coarse productions, is only about
a foot in thickness, and below this covering there is a rich
bed of clay.  Such lands are, therefore, evidently capable of
much improvement.  Excepting the holms on the banks of
the river, and on those of the larger brooks, which are of a
light and gravellish nature, the prevailing soil in the arable
districts is that of a reddish clay, upon a bottom of blackish
till.  This soil, under proper management, and in favour-
able seasons, yields good crops of oats; but, as it retains too
much moisture, it is apt, when in pasture, to be soon over-
run with moss and rushes.  I have been informed by a gen-
tleman, who had himself made the experiment, that the
best method of destroying rushes, or at least of keeping them
in so feeble a state that they can do little harm, is to cut
them early in the season, about the time when they begin
to flower, and afterwards, if necessary, in the autumn; al-
ways taking care not to allow them to run to feed.  By
this operation, repeated during two successive seasons he
has completely cleared his pasture-lands of a very exhaust-
ing and imperious weed.
   The climate is much the same here as in the other parishes
of this country :  Strong gales of wind, blowing directly from
the Western Ocean, and accompanied with frequent and
heavy showers of rain, constitute the prevailing weather.
Complete rainy days, however, are, I think, less common
here than on the east coast; neither does snow fall in such
