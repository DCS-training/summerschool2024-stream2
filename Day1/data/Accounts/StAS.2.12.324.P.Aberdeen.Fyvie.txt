and successively attained the dignities of Prior of Prior Pluscardine in
1585; Lord of Session, by the title of Lord Urquhart, 1587; Pre-
sident of the Court of Session in 1593; Treasury Commissioner,
1595; Peer of Parliament by the title of Lord Fyvie in 1598;
Commissioner to treat of the Union with England in 1604; Lord
High Chancellor of Scotland the same year; Earl of Dunferm-
line in 1606; and Commissioner to the famous Parliament of 1612,
which confirmed the proceedings of the Glasgow Assembly of
1610, and rescinded the act establishing Presbytery of 1592.
He continued Chancellor till his death at Pinkie, near Mussel-
burgh, in 1622, and was succeeded by his son. *
   Charles Second Earl of Dunfermline.-This nobleman took
an active part in the transactions of the momentous period of our
history from 1622 till his death in 1672.  In 1639, he was twice
sent from the Scottish Parliament to the King on missions of im-
portance.  In 1640, he was named a Commissioner to the treaty
at Ripon, and in 1642, he was Royal Commissioner at the Gene-
ral Assembly of St Andrews.  In 1649, he went abroad to Charles
II. and accompanied him in his unsuccessful attempt to asert his
rights in 1650.  At the Restoration he was made a Privy-Coun-
cillor; in 1669 an Extraordinary Lord of Session; and in 1671,
Keeper of the Privy-Seal.  He died in 1672, and was succeeded
by his son Alexander, third Earl, who survived but a short time,
and the property fell to his younger brother. +
   James Fourth Earl of Dunfermline.-He served in early life
under the Prince of Orange in several memorable expeditions, but
returned home on the accession of James II. in 1684.  He joined
Dundee in 1689, and fought at Killiecrankie.  He is celebrated
by the Jacobite author of the "Prelium Gilliecrankianum," as

                  Nobilis apparuit Germilodunensis
                  Cujus in rebelles stringebatur ensis
                  Nobilis et sanguine, nobilior virtute
                  Regi devotissimus intus et in cute;"

and his consequence and military reputation were such, that after
the death of Dundee he would have received the command, but
for, the unwelcome commission produced by Colonel Cameron.
He was outlawed in 1690, and died at St Germains in 1694 with-
out surviving issue, and the Fyvie property passed by purchase
in 1726 unto the present family. ++
