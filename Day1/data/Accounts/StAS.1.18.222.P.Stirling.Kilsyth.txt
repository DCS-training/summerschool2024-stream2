     Statistical Account

the whole new cut, and as it is generally four, though in
many places six feet below the surface of the adjacent grounds,
it serves as a general drain to the whole valley.  So that every
furrow which was formerly a little water ditch, and every
ditch which was formerly gorged up to the brink, is, or may
be easily drained; by this means, 300 acres of meadow may
be turned into arable land; 60 acres of moss into meadow,
and 500 acres of the finest arable land in the parish, may be
rendered of double value, in the course of a few years; and
that too, at very little expence.
   These advantages were seen by all the moment the first
part of the cut was finished.  So that it was an easy matter
to procure the concurrence of all the heritors of the south,
for extending it nearly two miles farther, the following sum-
mer; and that too, upon more equal terms.  Of course, the
advantages arrising from the work were extended in pro-
portion.
   The plan was formed, and executed under the inspection
of Mr Robert Whitworth Engineer.  And like all his other
undertakings in this country, gave great and general satisfac-
tion.  To prevent all disputes, and if possible any law suit,
two arbiters were mutually chosen by the heritors on the
south and north, to mark out the line of the new cut, in
consistency with the plan proposed, to judge of and determine
any difference, and to ascertain the comparative value of any
little parcel of ground that fell to be exchanged, or to be
sold.
   The dimensions of the cut are various, in proportion to
the quantity of water it receives.  For a mile at the top,
where there is only a small river, it is only from 18 to 20
feet wide at the surface, by 10 or 12 at the bottom.  But as
it receives new accessions of water, it was proportionally en-
larged.  So that the second mile, it is 22 or 24 at the top,
