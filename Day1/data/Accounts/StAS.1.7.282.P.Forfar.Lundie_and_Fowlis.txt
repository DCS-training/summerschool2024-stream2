110 in lakes, 119 in meadow ground, and the remainder hill
and pasture.  It is surrounded by Siddley-hills on the north
land west.  The south slope is green, and affords good pas-
ture.  The north or back part is heathy.  The middle of
the parish is pretty flat, and the soil is sufficiently produc-
tive, except in rainy or late seasons, when the crop is seldom
got in without damage.  The air is not unhealthy*, though
it must necessarily be moist, from the number of lakes and
fens in the parish.

   Lakes and Echo.-There are 4 lakes, all of which are sup-
posed to be full of marl, from the specimens that have been dug
from their sides; but none of them have as yet been drained.
Lundie loch, which is about a gun-shot from the church,
covers 72 1/2 acres, and is 60 feet deep in some places.  All
of them abound in pikes, perches, and eels; but there are no
trouts, or any other kind of fish in them.  These lakes are
the fountains of Dighty Water, which is so beneficial to the
country in general, particularly to Dundee; and which
empties itself into the sea at Monyseith, about 10 or 12
miles from this.-At a small hill, about 60 feet above the
lake of Pitlail, there is a remarkable echo.  When a person
stands upon this hill, the surrounding mountains of Siddley
forming a kind of amphitheatre, he will find a loud cry dis-
tinctly repeated three times at least, if not four+.

*There are no local distempers prevalent in either of these
parihes.  The most frequent disease is the rheumatism.  In-
stances of extraordinary longevity sometimes occur.  One man
died here, about 20 years ago, aged 106; and many have ex-
ceeded 80.

+The following anecdote strongly marks the simplicity of coun-
try people:-One summer evening, a young fellow sat down on
this hill to divert himself and some friends, by playing on the
