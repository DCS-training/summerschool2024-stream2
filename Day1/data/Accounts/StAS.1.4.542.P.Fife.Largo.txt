     Statistical Account

   Wages, Living, etc.-Working by contract is now much
practiced, the gain arising from which must be according to
the bargain they make, and the industry with which they
pursue their work.  The wages of common labourers and
hired servants can be easily ascertained, the general run be-
ing from 9 d. to 1 s. a-day; hired servants L. 13 a-year.
This is to be understood of the man's earnings; and if a
wife and children be concerned, it is but rare, that any ad-
dition can be stated to his income.  Female servants have
from L. 2 to L. 4, exclusive of their board, etc.  Labour-
ers and hired servants who have families, from the above
account, cannot live sumptously.  Except at a birth or
marriage, or some other festival, they do not in general
taste butcher-meat.  Meagre broth, potatoes, cheese, butter
in small quantities, and a preparation of meal in different
forms, make up their constant fare.  All things consider-

Sunday's clothes; all are clean and neat, with faces expres-
sive of contentment.-With a respect to the general rank of
people, their mode of living is undoubtedly improved, both
as to lodging and diet.-Notwithstanding the jarring opi-
nions in matters of religion, which may sometimes occasion
a distant and reserved behaviour, the people in general
have a kind and obliging turn.  They are honest, sober
and industrious; more forward to sympathise with their
neighbour in distress, than to rejoice with him in his pro-
sperity.  Tenacious of the peculiar doctrines of Christiani-
ty, they do not pervert them to encourage licentiousness,
being convinced, that purity of heart and life cannot be
separated from the exalted hope which the gospel in-
spires.

of Wood was founded by a Mr John Wood, who was a
