inexhaustible and of superior quality. Much time and labour
are employed by the people in summer, in cutting, drying, and
conveying the peat to their several dwelling-places, which are ge
nerally from two to six miles distant from the mosses. Peat and
turf are partially used by most of the families in the southern part
of the parish; they also use quantities of brushwood, which are
obtained by purchase, from the woods in the parish and neigh-
bourhood. Some of the families, in this part of the parish, make
use of coals chiefly for fuel. The coals are brought either from
Dundee, or from the depot connected with the railway at Newtyle.
Several of the farmers have been in the practice, for some years
past, of bringing home a certain quantity of coals during summer,
to be used as fuel in winter. This is a wise provision, although,
in ordinary dry seasons, peat may be safely got home, and makes
very good fuel; yet, when the summers are unusually rainy, it is
not sufficiently dried to be fit for burning, which is the cause of
no ordinary suffering to those families which depend entirely on
peat for fuel during the winter. It is highly probable, that coals
will soon be more generally used for fuel than they have hitherto
been in the parish.
