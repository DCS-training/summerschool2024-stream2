the ground into two branches, which again unite about four feet

Achmore and Newhall.

                        II.-CIVIL. HISTORY.
     Family of Menzies.*-The ancient history of this family is in-
volved in considerable obscurity, from the burning of the family
castle in the sixteenth century, when many of their private papers
were consumed.  They are generally supposed to have come first
to England with William the Conqueror, to have been the same
with the Maners, from which the Rutland family is descended,
and to have settled in Scotland soon after the Conqtiest, in the
reign of Malcolm Canmore. They became connected by mar-
riage with many of the greatest ans noblest families of the land.
     1. The first who is specially mentioned in any records, and ap-
pears to have been of considerable consequence, is Anketillus de
Maynoers, who lived in the reign of William the Lion, which
commenced in 1165.
     2. Robert de Meyners, Knight, supposed to have been, his son,
lived in the reigns of Alexander II. and III, was Lord High
Chamberlain of Scotland, one of the barons called Magates Sco-
tiae and frequently employed in embassies to England, " which
he discharged with great hotiour and commendation." His im-
mediate connection with this, country, with his power and posses-
sions in it, is proved by the grant of a charter of the lands of Cul-
dares," Matthaeo de Moncrief pro homagio et servitio suo."
