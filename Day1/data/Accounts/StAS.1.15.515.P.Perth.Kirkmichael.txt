   Fuel, etc.-The fuel generally used is peat and turf.  Lime
stone is plenty, and used for manure in different parts of the
parish; but less than would otherwise be the case, from the
expence of procuring peat to burn it.  No maile has been
found, except lately in one place.  It is reserved by the pro-
prietor for his own use.  There are 7 licenced retailers of
spirituous liquors.  No licenced distillers.

   Roads.-The military road from Coupar-Angus to Fort
George, passes along the Black Water and through Glenshee
It is kept in repair chiefly by the statute labours of the coun-
try.  A country road along the course of the Ardle is kept
in pretty good repair, in the same manner.

   Ecclesiastical State, Poor, etc.-The church was built in
1792.  It is finished in a respectable style, and sufficiently
large and commodious for the district of country in which it
stands.  It cost about 370 L. Sterling exclusive of carriage, of
lime, timber, etc.  In Glenshee is a chapel, where divine ser-
vice is performed by the minister of the parish, once in four
or five weeks.  The glebe consists of four acres of arable
land, of indifferent soil, and a steep sand bank for pasture.
The stipend is 1000 merks Scots, or 55 L. 11 s. 1 1/3 d. Sterling.
James Farquharson of Invercauld, Efq; is patron.  The funds
for supporting the poor, consist of a capital of 170 L. Sterling,
under the management of the kirk-session, them weekly collec-
tions made at church and occasional fines.  The annual a-
mount of the contributions is at an average 12 L. Sterling.
The number of poor who receive regular supplies from the
funds, is 14.  It is to be regreted that the funds are too small
to supply the necessities of the poor, without allowing such
as are able to go about to beg.  Such as confine themselves
within the bounds of the parish receive occasional supplies
