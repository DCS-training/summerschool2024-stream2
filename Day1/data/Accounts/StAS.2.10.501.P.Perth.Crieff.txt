  Parochial Registers.*-The parochial registers of Crieff do not
extend far back, and they are very incomplete.  The earliest entry
is 20th November 1692; and from that date to the present (Au-
gust 1837) the register of proclamation of banns is complete, with
the exception of one blank between the 1st of March 1713 and
the 6th of November 1748.  The register of births and baptisms
extends from the 27th December 1692 to the present time, with
the exception of a blank between the 8th of June and the 16th Of
November 1746.  The records of discipline are very defective.
They begin 3d October 1699; and from that date to the present
time there are no fewer than four blanks, viz 15th of February
1713 to 16th September 1723; 14th October 1739 to 1st No-
vember 1746; 26tb October 1760 to 12th July 1761; and 6th
December 1772 to 11th April 1833.  The accounts of the poor's
funds commence 19th June 1700; and from that to the present
time the following blanks occur, viz.  18th March 1713 to 25th
October 1747, and 19th.November 1790 to 24th May 1807.  The
whole is comprised in eleven volumes of different sizes. The deaths
have never been recorded.
  Antiquities, &c.-The antiquities of the parish are not nume-
rous; and of those that exist we have already mentioned some
connexion with those historical events to which they stand re-
lated. We shall now proceed to notice the few that remain.
  The Cross of Crieff is certainly a monument of great antiquity.
It stands near what was formerly the middle of the town, elevated
a rtep or two on a baser of hewn stone, and measuring 6 feet 3
inches in height, nearly 2 feet in width, and 6 inches in thickness.

<FOOTNOTE>The following extract from the session records  may accounts for the compara-
tively modern date of the earlier entry. "At Crieff, December 1st 1699, D`vid
Caw and James M'Culloch, in name of David Holmes, not present, report that Mr.
John Thomas, late session clerk of Crieff, now schoolmaster of Strowan, declares
that the session book was taken away by the souldier; and that David Sheares, late
box master, declares that the box is in the beddai's custody, and the key thereof in
his own. They appoint David Caw to require the key."
