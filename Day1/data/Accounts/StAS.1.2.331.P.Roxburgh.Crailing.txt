this parish.  The other roads are kept in repair by statute mo-
ney.  There is a bridge over the Oxnam, near the manse,
which is the only one in the parish.  It was built about 20
years ago, by subscription, and is still in good repair; it will
no doubt be upheld by the turnpike funds.-The nearest
bridge over the Teviot, is that at Ancrum, a short way a-

of Crailing; and on Sundays no fare is exacted, from persons
attending the parish church.

   Antiquities.-A Roman road or causeway passed through
the west of this parish, the traces of which are still to be
seen.  There are also vestiges of two encampments on the top
of Penelheugh; and that they belonged to the Romans, we

them seems to have been strongly fortified, and though now
totally demolished, it stlll retains the name of the Castle.-
The site of it is very high, and commands a most extensive
prospect; taking in at once all the windings of the Teviot from
Hawick to Kelso, and part of the several beautiful streams
which join it in that course.  The whole county of Berwick is
also seen from it, and a part of the German ocean.  The view
is bounded on the south by the lofty mountains of Cheviot,
and, on the north, by the Lammermuir hills.
   Nisbet is noted, by tradition, for being a strong-hold of
some of the antient marauders of the border.  Many persons
are yet living, who remember the ruins of two strong towers
at the village of Nether Nisbet, and stones of excellent work-
manship are still dug up from time to time.  It also deserves
to tbe mentioned, on account of its antiquity, and the singu-
larity of its tenure; that the proprietor of the barony of Crai-
