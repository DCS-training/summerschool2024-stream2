   It has been suggested that these advantages might yet farther
be increased by some amelioration of the cottage system. As the
Highland or Agricultural Society of Scotland have taken up the

more effectually the interests and sympathies of landlord and te-
nant, that, in the letting of land, it might be an improvement, to
make the amount of rent depend on the fiars prices of the county,
either in whole or in part. This would certainly be as equitable
a plan as the fluctuations in the value of farm produce could ad-
mit of, with this condition, that it might be expedient, in dear
years, to have a maximum, to protect the tenant, and in cheap
years, a minimum, to give a corresponding protection to the land.
