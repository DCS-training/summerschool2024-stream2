     PARISH OF AIR.

     By the Rev. Dr DALRYMPLE, and the Rev. Dr M'GILL.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.

   THE name of the town, parish, and country of Air, be-
longed first to the river, and was derived to them
from it.  It is probably of Celtic origin; for, according to
the information of a gentleman skilled in the Irish language,
Ahre signifies thin or shallow, and is truly descriptive of the
water of Air compared with the neighbouring water of Dohn, 
now Doon, which, flowing out of a large lake, is furnished
with a more deep and copious stream.  There are two towns 
of the same name in France, Aire in Artois, and Aire in Cas-
cony, which, no doubt, have the same etymology.  The an-
tient name of this parish, as appears from some old papers,
was Are; the modern name is Air or Ayr.  It is situated in 
the county of Air, presbytery of Air, and synod of Glas-
gow and Air.  It form is quadrangular.  The west side, a-
bout a mile and a half long, is bounded by the sea; the north,
about 3 miles long, by the river Air; the fourth, about the
same length, by the river Doon; the eastern side is fully 4
miles long, bounded by the parishes of Dalrymple and Coyl-
ton.  For a mile and a half south of the town, the country
is quite flat, and the soil sandy.  It is nearly the same on the
