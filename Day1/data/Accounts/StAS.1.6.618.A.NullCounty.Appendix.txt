without scruple, Saturday night was thought the most impro-
per in the week for going to the play.  Any clergyman, who
had been known to have gone to the playhouse, would have in
curred church censure.
   In 1783-The morality of stage-plays, or their effects on
society were not thought of.  The most crouded houses were
always on Saturday-night.  The boxes for the Saturday-night's
play were generally taken for the season, so that strangers
often on that night could not get a place.  The custom of
taking a box for the Saturday-night through the season, was

reeled from the tavern, slustered with wine, to an assembly
of as elegant and beautiful women as any in Europe.
   In 1763-The company at the public assemblies met at five
o'clock in the afternoon, and the dancing began at six, and
