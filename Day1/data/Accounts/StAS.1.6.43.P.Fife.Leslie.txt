most numerous set of handicraftsmen, no other class of me-
chanics bearing any proportion to them.  Their principal em-
ployment is weaving plain linen and cotton checks, by which
most of them can earn from 14 d. to 18 d. or 20 d. a day.  The
chief employment of the women is spinning lint and tow.
About 30 years ago, when they universally spun with one
hand, a help or slip, which is the fourth part of a spindle,
was thought a sufficient day's work for a woman; and mistres-
ses required no more of their maid-servants when they sat the
whole day at the wheel.  After they had spun their hesp, the
rest of the time was their own.  Before 1770, a wheel for spin-
ning with both hands was unknown in the parish, now almost
none else are to be seen it.  The manufacturers used to give
only 10 d. for spinning a spindle of yarn, so that, at that rate,
a woman earned only 15 d. a week; but now the manufactur-
ers pay 1 s. for spinning a spindle, and a woman can spin 2 1/2
spindles a week, which makes 2 s. 6 d.

   Stipend.-The stipend consists of 42 bolls of oat-meal, 8
Dutch stones to the boll; 22 bolls of barley, Linlithgow
measure; and L. 50 sterling in money.  The manse was
built in 1687, and repaired in 1789.  The glebe is very in-
different.  It is surprising to see some ministers estimating
their glebes, and adding their value to the livings; for there
is scarcely a minister who would not give his glebe to any
man that would drive his fuel, furnish his family with milk,
and a horse to ride on when he is necessarily called from home:
and, if the minister hath any tolerable skill in arithmetic, he
might give the man, who would supply him with the above
conveniencies, 5 guineas a year along with glebe; for in that
case he would save the expence of a man servant, which, as
times go, is at least L. 12. or L. 14, and the risque of losing a
