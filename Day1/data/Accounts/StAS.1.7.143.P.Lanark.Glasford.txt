ries; and the west is separated from Kilbride by a moss that
yields peat of good quality, and in great abundance.
   The spirit of improving land has not yet reached this pa-
rish.  There is in it only one man who deserves the name of
a farmer.  To improve land requires both industry and skill.
Few of the farmers here have a moderate portion of either,
and many are defective in both.  Though the land on the
east of the parish lies in the vicinity of lime and coal, and is
capable of vast improvement, it is nevertheless in much the
same state in which it was 20 years ago.  Potatoes, turnips,
and cabbages, for the use of cattle, may be raised in great
perfection.  Few, however, are planted but for culinary pur-
poses.  The fact is, that the greater part of the farmers are
proprietors, who occupy their own land.  The value of their
property, taken severally, may be from 30 L to 120 L a year.
They read no books on agriculture*; nor do they seek the
company of those who might inspire them with a taste for
improvement.  They seem to be contented with what they
have, rather than ambitious of more.  Though they are not
kind to the soil, their attachment to it is strong; and the
spot where they first drew breath is held sacred.
   The eastern part of the parish is inclosed with hedge and
ditch.  Thorn-hedges, however, on the marshy and light
loam soil, have been found not to succeed here; nor can
they be kept up but at great expence.  For the first three
years they do well enough; but, if afterwards they are not
once a year cleared of moss, within the course of ten years
they become completely incrusted with that noxious vege-
table.  To take off the moss without hurting the tree, re-
quires both skill and patience; and therefore this expedient
is seldom tried.  Another, less laborious, has been attempted.
