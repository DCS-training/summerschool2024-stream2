     NUMBER IX.

     PARISH OF ELLON.

     (County of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES MILN.

     Name, Extent, and Surface.

   THE etymology of the name Ellon is unknown.  It is
situated in the county and synod of Aberdeen, and is
the seat of a presbytery.  The parish of Ellon is in length
from south to north, about nine measured miles, and in
breadth from east to west, five measured miles.  The face of
the country is uneven; but it cannot be said to be hilly,
though there is a good deal of rising ground in it, which
goes under the denomination of hills; but they are very in-
considerable.  They are generally covered with health, as are
also some of the lower grounds.

   Soil, etc.-The nature of the soil is very various.  Some
grounds, especially in the southern parts of the parish, and
along the river side, are dry; but in the northern parts,
they are generally wet and mossy.  There are no lakes in the
parish.  The small river Ythan runs through the parish
from west to east.  It has its rise in the eastmost parts of the
parish of Forgue, about 15 or 16 computed miles from
Ellon, and runs through the parishes of Auchterless, Fyvie,
