to the salmon; but various methods are practised of catching
these; and as they soon leave the places where they are once
disturbed, they are now seldom seen farther up than Mony-
fieth.  The salmon, caught in the river, go principally to
the London market, fresh or pickled.  To carry them fresh,
the method first suggested by Mr. George Dempster, of pack-
ing them in ice, has been found of the greatest consequence,
and is now constantly adopted.  The price of salmon here is
always regulated by that of the London market, and general-
ly goes beyond it.  Our salmon fishings begin later than to-
wards Perth, and consequently less is carried in a fresh state
to London.  The rent of all the salmon fishings in the river
probably exceeds 3000 L. annually; but of this rent, those on
our shores yield a very inconsiderable part.  The currents of
the Tay being rapid, the channels of its waters are often
changed, and, consequently, in this part of the river the sal-
mon often change their course, and the annual value of any
particular fishing alters.  A fishing on the Fife shore, oppo-
site to Broughty Carrie, was let in 1789, at no greater yearly
rent than 40 L. and in that year the tacksman is said to have
cleared no less than 300 L.  As the parish is situated a good way
within the bar of the river, we have no sea weed for manure.
Some kelp is made, but in so small a quantity, that the shores
yield no rent; and any person who pleases is allowed to burn
it.  I know of no uncommon plants in the parish, or any un-
common shells upon its shores; neither spunges nor corals
are to be found.
   On the sea coast, without the bar, great numbers of sea-
fish are caught; haddocks, whitings, cod, ling, plaice, dab,
slounders, soles, turbot, holibut, skate, mackarel, and herrings.
Of these, the haddocks were the principal, and the most rea-
dily bought up.  They were some years a goin such plenty, as
to be an important article of food for the common people; but
