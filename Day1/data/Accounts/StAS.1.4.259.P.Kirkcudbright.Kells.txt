country.  The parish lies in the stewarty and presbytery
of Kirkcudbright, and Synod of Galloway.  It is nearly
in the form of an Isosceles triangle, almost surronded with
the rivers Ken and Dee.  The Ken runs from N. to S.
14 miles along the east side of it.  The Dee rises at the
N. W. end and runs along the W. and S. till it meets the
Ken.  Its length is about 15 miles; its greatest breadth,
at the N. end, 6 miles.  It continues nearly of this breadth
for 6 miles S.; then gradually diminishes to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
miles, till it ends in a point at the junction of the two ri-
vers Ken and Dee.  It is bounded on the E. by the pa-
rishes of Parton, Balmaclellan, and Dalry; on the S. by
Balmaghie; on the W. by Girthon and MInnigaff; on the
N. by Garsphairn.  The air is healthful.  The face of the
