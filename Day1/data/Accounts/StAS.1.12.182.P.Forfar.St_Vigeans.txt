     Statistical Account

March, April and May, and sometimes in autumn, from 15
to 25 persons in the distemper.  He does not remember to
have seen a single person in the ague for 20 years past.  There
never seems to have been what could be called a lake in the
parish; but as a great part of the ground lies on a clay bot-
tom, and formerly must have been very wet, it is thought
that this must have contributed to the prevalence of this dif-
temper.  The climate must, no doubt, now have become
much more healthy by the great number of ditches lately
made here.
   There are several caves in the rocks, along the W. between
Arbroath and Auchmithy, one of which can be entered only
at low water.  When seals abounded on this coast, it was cus-
tomary to let people down to this cave with a rope round
their body, to the death of 40 feet, with ropes of straw rol-
led round their legs, and bludgeons in their hands, in order
to kill seals.  There is another, called the Maiden Castle cave,
the entry to which is about 10 feet above high water-mark.
The mason-lodge of Arbroath built a gate to it, and gave it a 
door many years ago.  They walked in procession every year
on St. John's day from Arbroath to this cave, where they ad-
mitted new members.  It is about 231 feet long, and from 12
to 24 feet broad.  At the farther end there is a spring of fine
water, but exceedingly cold.  Above the cave are the vesti-
ges of a fort, about 100 feet above the level of the sea, and
on the land side the remains of the fossie and rampart are still
visible.  There is another cave, which appears as if it had
been cut out of the face of the rock, the entry to which is a-
bout 40 feet above the sea.  It is about 12 feet long, 10 broad,
and 8 high.  The access to it is difficult and dangerous*.

phenomenon called the gayler, or gaylet pol.  It lies in an arable field, and is
