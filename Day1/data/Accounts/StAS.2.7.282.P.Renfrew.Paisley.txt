   Supply of Gas.-A company, with the view of lighting Paisley
with gas, was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1823, the
capital being L.16,000, which has since been doubled.  The
works are on an extensive scale, and advantageously situated,
occupying an area of about two acres of ground, besides the space
occupied by the gas holders at Sacell and Ferguslie.  The num-
ber of retorts is at present 52; but that number the company are
about to increase.  Each of these is capable of producing about
6000 cubic feet of gas in twenty-four hours; 40 of these have
been in use this winter last summer only 4 were used.  The gas hold-
ers are 7 in number, 5 at the works, and the other two already no-
ticed.  Of the 7, four can contain of gas each 20,000 cubic feet,
two, each 18,000, and one 16,000.  The reason of placing two
of these at a distance from the works is, that the pressure of gas
may be equalized in all parts of the town and suburbs.  The coals
used in these works are brought from different places, but chiefly
from Ruchill, near Kelvin-dock.  The quantity carbonized from
June 1835 till June 1836, amounted to 3224 tons 10 cwt.  The
charge by metre is 8s. 6d. per 1000 cubic feet, and the annual
charge for one jet from sun-rise till 8 o'clock at night is 7s. 6d.,
till 9, 9s. 8d., till 10, 11s. 10d., till 11, 14s., and till 12, 16s. 2d.
   Pipes have now been laid in almost every street, and the greater
proportion of dwellings, shops, manufactories and churches, with
the street lamps ef the town and suburbs, are lighted with the pure
gas, which the company supplies.  The main pipes measure up-
wards of 50 miles in length.
   The town of Johnston is also lighted with gas, as well as several
public works, in the country parts of the Abbey parish, the gas
being made within their own premises.
   Management of Poor in the Abbey parish.-It was not till 1785
that assessment for the poor was resorted to in this parish; and the
rapid progress of trade and population, with the consequent influx
of strangers, will easily account for its introduction.  The assess-
ment for the first year was only L.152.  In 1792, when the old
Statistical Account was published, it had risen to L.415, and this
sum, with about L.125 per annum, arising from the collections at

<FOOTNOTE>reservoirs were formed to contain the floods of winter, thereby preserving an ample
supply during the whole year.-See Mathew's Hydraulia, p. 230.
   The city of Jerusalem was also supplied by Hezekiah, in a manner somewhat si-
milar.  See 2 Kings, xx. 20. and 2 Chron. xxxii. 30.  According to tradition
Solomon likewise constructed tanks for the same purpose.  For information respect-
ing these remains, see Landscape Illustrations of the Bible, Vol. 1st.  On the sub-
ject of the ancient aqueducts at Rome, See Leslie's Nat. Phil. Vol. i.
