     Of Birsay and Harray.

the sun fish appear upon our coast, but none of them
stricken.  Sometimes, indeed, a small whale will come
in, or a small shark; but in general they are of no con-
sequence.  Few or no fish are sent out of this parish to
any proper market, except dog fish as above.  Many
other sea animals, plants, spunges, corals, shells, etc.
are found upon this coast, which, to describe properly,
would require a separate Latin treatise of itself.  There
is plenty of sea weed, of the larger and finer kinds,
drove ashore by stormy weather; and all made use of
for dunging the land, and a most valuable article it is,
especially on the sea coast, where we are far from fuel;
and by consequence, what house dung can be made, can
go but a short way.

   Kelp.-Our shores are not very large; they may pro-
duce, between the barony and Marwick, 17 or 18 tons,
or thereabout, of kelp a-year.  As to the price of mak-
ing, it cannot be so well ascertained, the superior, till
within these 3 years, having burnt it for himself by his
tenants.  The price greatly varies:  since I came to this
country, I have seen it as low as 2 L. 10 s. the ton, and
sometimes at 9 L.

   Tides, etc.-As to the courses of our tides, the flood
tide sets right in from the N. W. upon the point of
the burgh of Birsay, from whence it splits, one part to-
wards Evie Sound, where it goes away with a rapid
stream towards Kirkwall; and the other part slips down
by Sandwick shore, till it get in to the indraught of
Hoy Sound, where it becomes very strong.  As to rocks,
we have three of what we call rims, which are generally
occupied by our fishermen as their best fishing grounds:
