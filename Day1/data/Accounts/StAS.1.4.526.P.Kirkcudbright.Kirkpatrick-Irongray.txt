smooth stones, which are of such a size as not to stop the
plough.  Of this sort of land there are above 500 acres, all
arable, for 2 miles up from the eastern extremity.  The
parish then rises into hills, except a track  of low land in
some parts, on both sides the river Cluden.  These hills,
as well as the fine track of land below, have been mostly
marled, and though it is said they were covered with heath
of old, yet having been ploughed, they have now a green
surface, and are good pasture; but though the soil is intrin-
sically good, the climate is cold, and the crops, though
luxiriant, are exposed to shaking winds, and late in coming
to maturity.  Passing the summits of these hills, the parish
slopes into a number of fine farms, little inferior in quality
to those on the east side, though the climate is not quite so
warm.  After passing a fort of valley, where there are a
few houses, the parish rises through a track of arable lands,
of a cold bottom, into sheep walks and moors, on the bor-
ders of Kirkpatrick-Durham, etc.  This description com-
prehends only that part of the parish lyinf E. of the old
water of Cluden, and S. of the burn of Cornlee: for to the
N. and W. of that winding stream, there rises a mountain
called the Bishop's Forest, apparently the highest, perhaps of
any at the same nearness to Dumfries, yet of no very steep
or difficult ascent in most places, owing to a very extended
and irregular base, around which are planted several large
and distinct farms and properries.  This hill is skirted along
the river Cairn to the N. with woods, for 2 miles, which
reach up the hill in many parts, for more than half a mile.
Some of the farms extend to the summit, and others only a
part of the way.  The hill has a heathy appearance at a
distance, with some rocks and moorstones rising to the view
at the same time, while the sheep find some green and
wholesome pasture here and there interspersed.-The in-
