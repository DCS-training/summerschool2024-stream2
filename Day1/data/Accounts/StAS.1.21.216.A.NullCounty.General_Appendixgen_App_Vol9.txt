tatoes.-A good deal of sea weed comes in on the shore,
which is found to be the most productive manure of any, for
one crop.  All who have access to it, take the benefit of it;
and it seldom fails to produce a rich crop, in any season.-
The tenants in general continue to sow the common Scots
bear; but there is barley in part sown in the farm of Dun-
robin.-The whole arable land of the parish consists of about
1500 acres, and about 200 acres of pasture land; exclusive
of hill, moss and moor land, of which there are several
thousand acres, fit only for sheep pasture.  It is remarkable,

their humanity to the most advantageous consideration of
interest.-The greatest part of the corn and meadow lands
are inclosed; in which circumstance this parish may be said to
excel most parishes in the north of Scotland.  But the truth
of this matter is, that a great part of the lands is in the hands
