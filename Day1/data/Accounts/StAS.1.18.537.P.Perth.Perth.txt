previous to the Reformation, and 162 writs or charters which
belonged to the Dominican monastery; 20 charters which be-
longed to the Carmelites or Whitefriars; 92 charters which
belonged to the Carthusians; 207 charters which belonged to
the chapels and altars.
   The acts and canons of the national councils were depo-
sited in the Dominican monastery at Perth, where these
councils ordinarily assembled.  But they were carried off or
destroyed at the Reformation.
   It was at Perth that the reformed religion was first public-
ly avowed.  Mr John Knox, attended by many of the chief
nobility of the kingdom, preached a sermon in the parish
church of Perth, against idolatry, Thursday, May 11 th, 1559.
After the sermon, one of the priests having given a trifling
provocation, a number of the people broke down all the altars
and images, in the parish church, and then proceeded to the
entire demolition of the monasteries.  No vestiges of the
monasteries and chapels are now to be seen.  Ever since that
remarkable ‘ra, a weekly sermon has been preached at
Perth, on the Thursday forenoon.
   Mr Henry Adamson, in his metrical history, says, that
"all the churches and chapels had lofty spires."  The only
spire now remaining, is that of the parish church.  However
necessary it might have been reckoned to destroy the cells of
the monasteries, their churches, if they had been left stand-
ing, would now have been found very useful.
   The records of the reformed church have been better kept
at Perth, than in most other places.  Registers, of the tran-
sactions of the Kirk Session, with some few interruptions,
are extant from the year 1577.  The registers of the presby-
tery of Perth, are extant from the year 1618.  And the re-
gisters of the synod of Perth and Stirling, are extant from the
year 1638.
