fordjohn, and, for some miles before joining the Clyde, has
an average breadth of about 40 feet; the Douglas, which,
flowing through the beautiful dale to which it gives name, falls
into the Clyde, near Harperfield, a little above the Bonnington
Falls; the Culter, which, passing through a pretty glen, divides
the parish of the same name; the Medwins, north and south, the
former of which, rising on the north-east of the parish of Carn-
wath, and pursuing a south-west course, is joined in the south of the
parish by its sister stream, which rises near Garvaldfoot, in the
parish of West Linton, after a course of nine miles, about a mile
and a half from the junction of the united streams with the Clyde;
the Mouse, which, rising in the north of Carnwath, flows in a west-
ward course through the centre of Carstairs parish, still and slug-
gish, but, on entering the parish of Lanark, winds through the pe-
culiarly bold and picturesque glen of Cartlane Craigs, soon after
emerging from which it falls into the Clyde, opposite the village
of Kirkfield bank; the Nethan, which, rising in the west of Lesma-
hago parish, and mutually giving and receiving beauty, as it winds
among the fine seats that adorn its banks, falls into the Clyde at
Clydesgrove, after passing the Picturesque and interesting ruin of
Craignethan Castle, the Tillie Tudlem Castle of Old Mortality;
the Avon, which, rising on the confines of Ayrshire, flows through the
parish of Avondale, dividing it into two nearly equal parts, through
the parish Of Stonehouse, being in one part of its course the
boundary between that parish and Glassford, and separating it, on
another, from Dalserf, then passes into Hamilton, at Millbeugh
Bridge, a little below which it forces its way through a rocky de-
file of uncommon grandeur and picturesque effect; its banks often
towering to the height of 250 and 300 feet, and crowned with
aged oaks, and other hard-wood; emerging from this defile it
flows through the haughs of Hamilton, till it blends with the Clyde
at Hamilton Bridge; the South Calder, which, rising in the moor-
land grounds near Tarrymuck, in Linlithgowshire, flows westward,
forming, for upwards of nine miles, the boundary between the pa-
rihes of Shotts and Cambusnethan; it then turns to the north-
west, separating Dalziel from Shotts, forming part of the southern
boundary of Bothwell, and mingles with the Clyde, after a course
of about twenty miles the North Calder, having its source near
the farm of Bertram Shotts parish and flowing through Old Monk-
land, falls into the Clyde at Daldowie; of both these streams,
the banks are, in general, beautifully wooded, and adorned with
many fine seats the Calder water, called also the Rotten Calder,
