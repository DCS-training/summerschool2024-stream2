dustrious naturalist might discover, on this coast, some of
those singular animals, not much inferior to those produced
in the Antilles, and other tropical countries.

   Fish.-As the south end of Buittle is washed by the Sol-
way Frith, a good deal of fish is taken, and much more
might be had.  As other subsistence is plenty, however, and
as labourers and their families are maintained by their em-
ployers, neither choice nor necessity leads any one to follow
the fishing business, much farther than as an amusement.
Nevertheless, it is believed by many judicious people, that if
a few fishermen from the Highlands should settle about the
mouth of the Urr, they would and profitable employment,
and be of service to the country around.  The fish usually
taken at present are, salmon, cod, flounders, etc.  Cockles,
muscles, and several other kinds of shell fish are also to be
had in tolerable plenty.

   Quadrupeds.-The quadrupeds are entirely of the com-
mon sort, and the black cattle (which are almost all polled)
are of a good shape.  During the time that a farmer society
subsisted at Dumfries, which invited the tenantry to shew
their best breeding cattle, and distributed premiums, the
mould of cattle was visibly improved.  Since that society
was dropt, farmers have become, it is thought, more careless,
both in Buittle, and in many parishes around.  The breed
of horses is much improved, so far as concerns the purposes
of agriculture; but the old hardy Galloway species is mostly
extinct.  Sheep are kept in small numbers, being thought
prejudicial to the pastures where black cattle are fed; nor is
the growth of wool attended to, or considered as an object
of profit, unless on the small scale of domestic oeconomy
