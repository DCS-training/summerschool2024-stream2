 Manufactures.--The principal manufacture is that of hand-loom
weaving, in which both men and women are employed.  In the
large manufacturing establishment at Kirkland, under the firm of
Neilson and Company, there are 109 persons engaged in flax-
dressing; 283 employed at the spinning-mail; 48 in the bleaching
department; and 241 in the cloth manufactory; in all, 681, in-
cluding men and women, boys and girls.  This large and exten-
sive work is lighted with gas, and is, for plan, and order and re-
gularity, a model for any similar erection.  As far as the health
and morals of the people are concerned, it is conducted in the
best possible manner.  It is not only the wish of the proprietors
that the work people's children should be properly educated, but
they are really and truly so, in all the common branches; and
particular attention is also paid to their instruction in the great
principles of Christianity, by a well-qualified and efficient teacher.
And fewer applications for parochial relief have come from the
people employed at this work, than from any other quarter of the
parish.
 The extensive works now noticed consume annually 1000 tons
flax and hemp, from which is spun 280,000 spindles of flax, tow,
and hemp yarns, two-thirds of which are made into canvas, sheet-
ing, dowlas, ducks, sacking, and other fabrics; and about one-
third of the yarn is sold.  The yearly amount of wages may be
about L. 17,000.
 There are four considerable manufacturers in East Wemyss,
and one in Buckhaven,, who, it is computed, consume annually
242320 spindles, which are made into ducks, dowlas, and sheet-
ing, amounting to 1,202,625 yards of cloth for the home and
foreigh market.  Weavers' wages, including winding, may amount
to L. 10,000 annually.
 East Wemyss was long distinguished for the manufacture of
linen, which has, for some time past, been superseded by those
above-mentioned.
 Salt.--Since the tax on salt was taken off, the number of salt pans
has been greatly reduced.  At Methil, where there were formerly
