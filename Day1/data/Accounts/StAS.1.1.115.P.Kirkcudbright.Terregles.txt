     of Terregles.

   There are several seceders, and a few Roman Catholics.
None of the inhabitants have emigrated, nor have any been
banished from it, in the memory of man.

   Church and Stipend.-The church is of the Gothic stile,
and was built above 200 years ago.  The value of the stipend,
including the glebe, is between L. 65 and L. 70 per annum,
according to the rise or fall in the price of victual, part of it
being paid in meal and barley.  The Duke of Queensberry
is patron.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-As this parish lies near the
town of Dumfries, living is very expensive.  Fuel is extreme-
ly dear.  Coal is brought by land 27 or 28 miles; and the
price of coal transported by sea is as dear as what is brought
by land.  Peat, too, is at a great distance.  The expences of
living are nearly double what they were formerly.   The wa-
ges of domestic servants and day-labourers are also consi-
derably raised.  There is a salmon-fishery on the side of
the river Nith, opposite to the foot of the parish, from which
the minister of Terregles draws tithe in money.  There is
an old ruin in this parish called the College of Lincluden.
