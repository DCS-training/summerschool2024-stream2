tor Boethius calls it Dundore, the golden mountain in Garioch
and says, that the teeth of the sheep that pastured upon it
were of the colour of gold.  It still affords most excellent
pasture for sheep, but has no such quality as is ascribed to it
by that very credulous historian.  This hill is about 3000
yards in circumference, and above 300 feet high, and seems
to spring from the level plain of the Garioch.  It has been,
probably in some very early period, a volcano, though diffe-
rent opinions are formed concerning this curious hill.

   Rivers and projected Canal.-The small rivulets in this pa-
rish are not worth notice on their own account; but they
are very proper for supplying with water a projected canal
from Insch to Aberdeen.  This canal has been some time in
contemplation, and at present it is thought that it will suc-
ceed, at least as far as Inverury.  The subscription for the
undertaking is already swelled to a great amount.  But if
the proprietors of land were to carry on the canal, and to con-
tribute sums proportioned to their property; and if, instead
of 2 d. per ton for each mile, only a halfpenny per ton (for
defraying the expence of boats, and keeping the canal in
repair) were exacted, a number of heavy articles, such as
stones for London, and potatoes tor Denmark and Norway,
would be carried to Aberdeen, which could not be carried,
if the canal dues or porterage be high; and the lands in
this district would soon increase in rent, much more than all
the interest of the money expended on the canal.  Should
this canal succeed, it is difficult to say, how much the rich
district of the Garioch, for which nature has done so much,
and art so little may advance in value in 30 or 40 years.
