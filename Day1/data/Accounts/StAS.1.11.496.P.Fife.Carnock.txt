     Statistical Account

plentiful, there is no demand for marl, though some of the
latter has been dug from the moss in the S. E. part of the
parish.  The farm of Carnell was all enclosed since 1761, and
likewise the Clune farm since 1757; the former being done
by Mr. Colvill, the present farmer, and the latter by Mr.
Chalmers, the late proprietor of these lands.

   Language.-That the Gaelic or Erse was the ancient lan-
guage of this part of the country, is evident from the names
of most places in the parish; such as Carnock, Luscar, Clune,
Blair, Pitdenny, Carneil, etc.; though others, indeed, of later
date, are clearly of modern derivation; such as Bonny-Town,
Herd-Hill, Gowk-Hall, Wood-End, etc.  The language now
generally spoken in this district, is the broad Scotch dialect,
with the Fifeshire accent, which gives some words so peculiar
a turn, as to render the speaker almost unintelligible to the
natives of a different county.

   Eminent Men.-Under this head, we can only enume-
rate as natives of this parish, or residents in it, the Rev.
JOHN Row, above mentioned, (whose father was minister
of it in the beginning and middle of last century, and) who
was promoted to be principal of King's College in Aber-
deen; and the late Mr. JOHN ERSKINE of Carhock, profes-
sor of municipal law in the college of Edinburgh, and
author of the larger and lesser Institutes of the Law of
Scotland.  Of Mr. Erskine's abilities we need say nothing.
His eminence as a lawyer is universally known.  He resided
at his house of Newbigging, in this parish, during the sum-
mer season, for upwards of 30 years; but at last removed to
Cardross, in Monteith, where he died in the year 1767, hav-
ing, some years before that, purchased considerable property
