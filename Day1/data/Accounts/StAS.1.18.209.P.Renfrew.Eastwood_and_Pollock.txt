   Parish Records.-The records of Session extend back to the
year 1689.  They contain, frequently, circumstances which
mark the peculiar manners of former times.  In the earlier
periods, the meetings of Session were seldom held.  The
good morals which prevailed, it is presumed, rendered fre-
quent meetings unnecessary.  This is the more remarkable,
when it is considered that every species of vice, and even of
impropriety, were subjects of cognizance.  Sometimes too,
we find their attention directed to objects which will appear
to the present age, of a singular kind.  A woman is delated
for using charms at Hallow-even; who, to use the words of
the record, confesses, "That at the instigation of an old
"woman from Ireland, she brought in a pint of water from
"a well which brides and burials pass over, and dipt her
"shirt into it, and hung it before the fire; that she either
"dreamed, or else there came something and turned about
"the chair on which her shirt was, but she could not well see
"what it was."  Upon this, she was ordered to be rebuked
before the congregation.  Let not the wisdom of our fathers
however be treated on such accounts lightly.  The innocence
or guilt of all actions depends much upon the views which
governed the actor.  What may be now mere amusement,
when it was performed under the belief of incantation, and
with a view to the agency of evil spirits, was a proper sub-
ject of animadversion to those whose duty it was to watch
over the moral and religious conduct of the people.  In dif-
ferent meetings of Session, and among the elders, are to be
found the names of Lord Pollok, one of the Senators of the
College of Justice, and his nephew and heir Sir John Max-
well; and, it is related of them, that they conceived it to be
their honour, as well as their duty, to support in that parish
over which they had influence, the cause of religion, and her
constant attendants, decency, order, and true happiness.
