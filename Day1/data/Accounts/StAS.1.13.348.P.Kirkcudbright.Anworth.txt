   Animal and Vegetable Productions.-A much greater
quantity both of grain and cattle is produced in the parish
than is necessary for the sustenance of its inhabitants.  About
650 acres are employed in raising oats, 70 in barley, and a
few acres in potatoes, about 1 at an average to each farm.
The soil is not confidered to be well adapted to the produc-

been raised.  Little attention is paid to the cultivation of
hemp and lint.  Oats is the principal crop.  The grain
not consumed in the parish is partly sold in the neighbour-

the Clyde.  There are about 1260 black cattle, 140
horses, and 4000 sheep in the parish.  A few cattle are
satted for home consumption, or sold to butchers, who

but the greater part are fold when three years old to dro-
vers, who take them to the English market.  They are of
a middle size, fatten well, and weigh far beyond their ap-
parent bulk.  The sheep which pasture on the morrish part
of the parish are of a middle size; their face and legs are
black, the body white.  They sell at about L. 7 a score, of
21 to the score, before they are satted; their wool is rather
coarse, and is sold about 9 s. the stone, of 28 pounds.
There is another kind commonly called muggs; they are
much larger; their wool is far superior, both in quantity
and quality, but their flesh is not reckoned near so delicious
as that of the moor sheep.  The kind most esteemed in the
