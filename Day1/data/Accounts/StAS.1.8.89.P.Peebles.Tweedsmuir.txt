parish belong to 7 different heritors, of whom only 1 re-
sides.  The poor are assisted by the weekly collections at
church; a school was lately instituted, and a school house
built; the heritors fixed the salary at 100 merks Scotch, but
the scholars are few in number.

   Antiquities-Some remains of antiquity are to be seen in
this parish, near the highway; and a few miles above the
Boild there are several cairns, which have probably been rais-
ed over some ancient graves*:  Vestiges of ancient castles still
remain at Oliver; at Fruid, where a family of the name of
Fraser formerly resided; and at Hackshaw, the seat of the an-
cient family of the Porteouses.
