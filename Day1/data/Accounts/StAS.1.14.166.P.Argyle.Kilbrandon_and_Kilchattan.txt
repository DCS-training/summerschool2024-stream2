   State of the Poor.-About 50 persons receive some aid
from the kirk-session yearly.  All their funds for this pur-
pose, consist of about 65 L. of mortified money; the inte-
rest of which, together with weekly collections at church,
amounts to 24 L. or 25 L. a-year.  This small sum is evi-
dently very inadequate to relieve them.  They are al-
lowed to beg, therefore; and the inhabitants, who are
charitably disposed, assist them as their circumstances can
afford.

   Schools.-In this parish there are 3 public schools; a
parochial one, supported by a stent of valued land, and
2 schools, supported by the Society at Edinburgh for
propagating Christian Knowledge.  At these 3, there
are commonly about 200 boys and girls, taught reading,
writing, arithmetic, and church music.
