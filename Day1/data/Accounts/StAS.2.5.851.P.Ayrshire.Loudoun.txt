  Ecclesiastical State.- The parish church is most conveniently
situated for the parish. It was built in 1738. It is seated for
800 only; though the present number of communicants regularly
partaking of the Lord's Supper in it is upwards of 900  It is
much out of repair. Every hope is entertained that a new one
will soon be built. The manse was built in 1768, and additions
were made to it at a subsequent period. It was repaired four
years ago.
	The glebe contains eight acres arable land, and eight acres of
pasture. It is worth about L.50 per annum. The stipend con-
sists of 165 bolls of meal, 14 bolls of barley, and L.43 in money.

milies or rather individuals who are not in communion  with any
church, but who have been baptized, in the Establishment.
	There are two Dissenting congregations in the parish, one con-
nected with the United Assnciate Synod, the other with the Re-

congregation was formed in Newmilns in l772. Their first place
of worship was built in 1773 and contained 400 sitting. Their
present church was built in 1833, and contains 780 sitting. The
congregation consists of persons from different parishes; about
chiefly from Loundoun and Galaton. The number of communi-
cants in 1841 was 470.
