the came in, which succeeded the autumnal equinox.  The
best oats here produce 8 stone, Dutch weight, of meal, from
a boll of the ordinary measure of the country; one boll and a
fourth of which, is nearly equal to the English quarter of 8
Winchester bushels.  The produce of an acre varies greatly,
according to the soil, the season, and other circumstan-
ces.
   Almost every husbandman cultivates potatoes; not only for
the use of his family, but to feed his horses and cows; for
which they are found very beneficial.  There are also a good
many cultivated for sale.  Artificers, inhabitants of the town
and villages, plant potatoes on spots rented for one year, for
which they pay at the rate of from L. 4 to L. 8 per acre;
and this they dress at their leisure hours.  The cultivation of po-
tatoes is advantageous.  It puts the ground in good order for
the ensuing crop, whilst an acre, when ready for digging,
commonly sells at from L. 12 to L. 18.  However, much of
the soil, in this parish, being rather heavy for that root, the
culture of it does not succeed well in very wet, or very dry
seasons.  Besides, every sort of soil here, is injured by repeating
culture of potatoes too frequently upon it.  The plant itself,
also, is of late frequently infected with a disease, particularly in
the lower grounds near the town, which proves very injurious.
After it begins to rise, its leaves contract and shrivel, and when
that part of the stalk, which is below the earth, is examined,
a narrow groove, or longitudinal scar, appears corrode
through the fine glossy rind; and, on that part, the pure
white is tinged with a light ochre colour; which tinge, when
the disease goes to a great height, is afterwards communicated
to the new roots.  When those symptoms appear, though the
plant proceeds to produce flowers and apples, its growth is
stunted, and sooner over than that of a healthy plant; and,
when the disease is violent, the roots which it produces, are
