   At the Revolution, the whole funds delivered over to the
Session, amounted only to L. 19:10. Sterling.  The weekly
collection at that time never exceeded 1 s and 8 d; yet there
is now in land and heritable bonds and cash, a fund near
L. 300 Sterling, for the support of the poor; and that too
raised, not by a parsimonious hoarding up of the poor's funds,
not by withholding what was meet, or granting the needy
only a penurious pittance, but by a prudent faithful discharge
of their duty, in collecting and distributing.  That the Ses-
sion of Kilsyth, was not in use to deny the relief which was
necessary; and that these funds have been managed with
such prudence and care, will appear from the following
table.

   For the last ten years, the average of receivings, is annu-
