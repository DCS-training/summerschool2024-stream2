     Of Kemback.

by a small rivulet called Ceres burn, which falls into the
Eden a little below Kemback mill.  The banks of this
stream on both sided rise to a great height, in a great va-
riety of inclinations, forming a den, called the Den of
Dura, which presents an assemblage of wild grandeur
and natural beauty, such as is very rarely to be met
with.  Of this den, the windings are about a mile in
lenght; and, on both sides, the eye is delighted with a
rich variety of picturesque and romantic scenery.  The 
banks in some parts slope gently towards the water, and
are covered with a beautiful verdure of grass, affording
pasture for sheep; in other parts, they are perpendicu-
lar, of overhang at the stream at an elevation of 50 or 60
feet; and in one place, the bank on the W. side, forms it-
self into the figure of a very extensive amphitheatre.  Here
and there we meet with small plantattions of ash and oak,
and fir, and gean; and where the banks are steepest, they
present a surface of broken faced rocks towards the bot-
tom, and higher up, are covered with large thickets of
wild hazles, which produce great quantities of nuts.  It
is not easy to conceive a scene more beautiful, or more
highly diversified than this den exhibits in the summer
months.  The murmuring noise of the stream, running
along its rocky channel, the music of birds, the fragrance
of woodbine and eglantine, the beautiful blossoms of the
furze and the broom, and the gean interspersed with the
different shades of verdure of the oak, the ash and the
fir, joined to the wild variety of views, which every step
almost presents, conspire to render it one of the most de-
licious spots, which nature, without the assistance of art,
can form.
