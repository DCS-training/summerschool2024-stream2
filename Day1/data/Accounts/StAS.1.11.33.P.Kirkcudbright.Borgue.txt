in any part of the parish.  The little hills, which rise every,
where, and in all the varieties of shape, are nothing but
masses of rocks, covered with a thin stratum of earth.  The
soil is, for the most, part, a fine loam, sometimes intermixed
with sand or gravel, and either founded on a rock, or hard
gravelly bottom.  Hence it is extremely kindly, and, in wet
seasons, very productive, either in crop or pasturage; but it
is soon exhausted by tillage, and easily injured by drought.
Any level ground, which was to be found among the numer-
ous little hills, originally consisted of moss; which is now al-
most entirely consumed in digging for suel or marl, and hath
left nothing but morasses and pits of' standing water.

   Prospects.-The rising grounds, in many different places of
this parish, afford very beautiful prospects. The writer of
this article has reckoned 15 or 16 different views of the sea,
presented through the openings among the little hills. A very
extensive view is exhibited of the circumjacent country, the
surface of which is finely diversified. On the one side stands
Kirkcudbright, and the seat of the EARL of SELKIRK; on the
other, Wigton, Garlieston, and Whitehorn, the seat of the
EARL of GALLOWAY.  Behind, are the mountains of Gallo-
way, rising gradually above one another at proper distances:
Before, Whitehaven, Workington, and other towns. The Isle
of Man, St. Bee's Head, and the lofty mountain of England,
stretching out to an extent of 60 or 70 miles, form the limits
of the varied scene.-There are no rivers or lakes which de-
serve to be mentioned; and very little wood, except a few
small plantations around gentlemen's seats.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate does not admit of that
extent and variation, that takes' place in the inland and moun-
tainous parts of the country.  The cold is never so intense
