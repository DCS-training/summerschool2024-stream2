est breadth from 10 to 12.  It is intersected from the south
by the lochs of Caolisport and Castleswen.  The first, and
most easterly, penetrates about four miles into the coun-
try, and derives its name from its narrowness.  The second
owes its title to a castle, situated near its mouth; which, to-
gether with others on the western coast, were erected as
fortresses by Swen, the Danish conqueror.  The loch ha-
ving passed this place about two miles, sends off a branch
to the westward; and continuing its course for two or three
miles farther, expands suddenly, and splits at once into se-
veral branches, resembling the palm, thumb, and fingers of
the hand.  The intervals between these branches are finely
diversified with woods, rocks, fields, and sheets of water,
which, viewed from the road leading from Inverlussay to
Glassory, exhibit an assemblage of contrarieties so wildly
grotesque, that fancy can hardly image a landscape more ex-
quisitely delightful.  The division of Knapdale westward
of this loch, called Ross, is of excellent quality.  Could the
soil and rocks, with which it is unfortunately interspersed, be
separated, there would not perhaps be a more fertile spot in
Scotland.  The country to the eastward, if we except the
estates of Castleswen and Knap, the low grounds of Inver-
neil, Ceannlochcaolisport and Ormsary, the extensive plains
round Kilberry Castle, and a few patches along the fea-
coasts, forms a counter-part to that of Ross.  It swells into
high and rugged mountains, incrusted with moss, and shroud-
ed with heath.  The shore, however, where not arable,
is generally covered with wood; which furnishes excellent
shelter, and proves very convenient for the winter-pasture
of black cattle.

montories or headlands.  The most westerly is called the
point of Kilvicoharmaig.  Its figure is somewhat like that
of a crescent, between which and the beautiful peninsula of
