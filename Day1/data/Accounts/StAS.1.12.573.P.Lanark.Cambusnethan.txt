     Of Cambusnethan

   Villages.-The late increase of inhabitants is partly owing
the proximity of the Omon iron-works, in the parish of
Shotts, but chiefly to the convenient situation of a village on
the lands of Wishaw and Coltnes.  This village had no ex-
istence 20 years ago.  In consequence of its erection, there
are few cottages attached to particular farms, and another
village, less conveniently situated, which was formerly of
considerable extent, is fast going into decay.  Of the trades-
men, who inhabit the village, and indeed the parish at large,
there are few employed by manufacturing companies; and

   Roads.-The great road from Glasgow to Lanark, runs

new road on the S. side of the Clyde is finished.  The sta-

parish.

   Ecclesiastical State.-It appears that this parish was for-

Roxburgh.  The Duke of Hamilton is now titular.  Mr.
Lockhart of Castlehill, proprietor of the estate of Cambus-
nethan, is patron.  The value of the living, exclusive of
manse and glebe, amounts to nearly 130 L. Sterling.  The
stipend is chiefly paid in oat-meal.

   School and Poor.-The schoolmaster's salary is 200 merks.
He has a free house, but no garden.  The average number
of scholars is about 60.  The school-wages a-quarter, are, for
reading english, 1 s. 6 d., reading and writing, 1 s. 9 d., arith-
metic and latin, 2 s. 6 d. each.-In order to avoid the impo-
