was cut and streightened, furnished a considerable quantity
of fine trout.  The pools were numerous and large.  But,
being a muddy flow running river, it became a harbour for
pikes:  This voracious animal preyed upon the small fish.
But now, that the course of the river is open and clear, and
free of pools, the trout must in time become more abundant;
whereas the pike can find little or no harbour.
   The great canal, in all likelihood, will prove a very ample
source of supply for all kinds of fish that delight in a stagnant
muddy water.  Perch, pike, and brozes, already abound.
The first, though numberless, and caught even by children
with the greater case, are as yet for the most part very small.
They seldom exceed 6 inches, though I have seen them a foot

only the amusement of children to catch them, the true
angler seldom thinks it worthy of his attention.

   Springs.-There is perhaps no district where there is
a greater variety and abundance of springs.  Along the whole
brow of the hills they abound; and they are equally remark-
able for the quantity and quality of the water they fend forth.
There is one or two so copious, that during the heat of sum-
mer they will each fill a pipe of 3, perhaps 4 inches diameter;
and the water of almost all of them is as pure as crystal.  Two

their respective names; the one is called St. Tartan's, per-
haps a contraction of St. Tallertan's; the others which seems
to have attracted the attention of our forefathers for many
generations, is called St Mirron's.  There is a third that goes
by the name of Kittyfrist well.  There is no superstitions ve-
