     PARISH OF DAIRSIE.

     (County of Fife).

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT M'CULLOCH.

     Situation and Surface.

   THIS parish is situated in the county and synod of Fife,
and in the presbytery of Cupar.  It is of an irregular
form, extending from the south-west, to the north-west, two
Scots miles, and from the south-west, to the north-east, near-
ly as much.  Its general appearance is that of a gently rising 
ground.  There are in it two hills of a moderate height,
from which are very extensive prospects.  The one is called
Foodie, the other Craigfoodie, and both of them are remark-
able for bearing good crops nearly to their tops.  The foil
in this parish is for the most part fertile, and in many places
rich and deep.  The air is generally dry and healthy.  There
are no considerable rivers in this district, except the Eden,
which forms its boundary to the south and south-east, and, a 
little farther on, runs into the Eastern ocean. It abounds
with excellent trout, and a few salmon are sometimes caught
in it.  The fish are mostly taken by the rod, and very few
are ever sent to market.

   Population.-This parish contains 540 persons.  In Dr
Webster's report, the number of fouls is 469. The are 11
