                             KINROSS-SHIRE.

generally succeeds potatoes or turnips, and the average weight
may be about 18 stones per Linlitligow boll, although often above
19 stones. In a competition in the year 1833, between a gentle-
man possesing extensive properties in the county of Clackmannan,
and an heritor in this parish, as to which of the counties. Clack-
mannan or Kinross, that year would produce the best barley, it being
agreed that each should stand by the produce of his own farm,
the bet was decided in favour of Kinross-shire, the weight being
58 1/2 lbs. per imperial bushel. In the same year, some barley was
raised in Portmoak, close to this parish, and when sold at Kirk-
aldy market was found to wehgb 60 lbs. But this last was ex-
trernely well cleaned.
     There are five or six quarries cf red sandstone, one of which
only, close to Milnathort, is wrought for sale. There are also se-
veral of green or whinstone; but these are principally used for
furnishing stones for dikes, and metal for the roads.
     Zoology.__Game was at one time abundant, but is now almost
extirpated, owing to tb6 remissness of the tax-office in not prose-
cuting and publishing the lower class of poachers. A few roe-deer
are occasionally seen, but do not seem to breed in the parish.
The other kinds of gaine are the grouse, blackcock, partridge,
woodcock, snipe, wild-duck, bare, and rabbit. The only birds of
considerable rarity which have been observed are the kingfisher
(Alcedo Ispida) and the cross-bill (Loxia curvirostra.)
    The principal kinds of fish are the common burn trout, Loch
Leven trout, (a variety of the former,) eels, pike, and perch. But
almost all these belong more properly to Loch Leven, which falls
to be noticed under the account of the parish of Kinross.
Botany. Orwell contains few or none of the truly rare plants.
The following may be mentioned, either because they are rare in
the district, or common in the parish, although not generally dif-
fused throughout Scotland.
