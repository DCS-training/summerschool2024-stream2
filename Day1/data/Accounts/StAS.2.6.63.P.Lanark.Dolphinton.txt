He mortified 200 merks, the interest to be paid to the poor.
He also mortified two acres of land to the minister, which has not
been possessed by him since the revolution.  Mr Bowie laid out
8000 merks for the lands of Stonypath; and in 1759 he mortified
them to the minister and kirk-session, to be disposed of as follows:
100 merks to the schoolmaster for educating 20 scholars; 100
merks for educating any lad of a bright genius, to be allowed for
six years, whom failing, to pay apprentice-fees; 50 merks, either
to be distributed among the poor of the parish, or to be laid out
in buying books for the poor scholars; and 50 merks to the mini-
ster, with all the other profits arising from the lands, to compen-
sate for his trouble as factor.
   Poor.-There are 4 paupers, who receive at present L.17
per annum.  The whole yearly expenditure of the kirk-session is
not less than L.25.  In 1755, the average of the ordinary collcec-
tions on Sabbath was 1s.  In 1792 it was 1s.6d.; and for the last
ten years it has averaged nearly 3s. 10d.  The interest at four per
cent. of L.250, invested on bond, yields L.10.  These sums, to-
gether with 11S. ld. being interest on Brown's mortification, and
what is derived from proclamations and the use of the mortcloth,
may amount to about L.21.
   Library.-In summer 1825, a parochial library was established,
which, by liberal contributions in aid of the funds, now contains a
considerable number of useful and well-read books.
