   this parish there are no data from which we might form even a
   probable conjecture, in regard to the direction of this mighty cur-
   rent.  Were we, however, permitted to travel beyond our bounds,
   we might remark, in passing, that, in the neighbouring parish of
   Boyndie, a narrow line of water-worn boulders of hornblend and
   bypersthene, many of them weighing more than thirty tons, runs
   from a north-easterly to a south-westerly direction, and which are
   traced more than thirty miles in that line through part of the pa-
   rishes of Boyndie, Ordiquhill, Grange, Keith, Cairney, &c. while
   no rock on that line, of the same kind, is found in situ.
      No organic remains are known to have been found within the
   parish, neither of plants nor animals, neither the ores of any of
   the metals, with the exception of iron, which, in combination with
   the mineral, gives it its colouring matter.
      Zoology.*-- The mammalia, and indeed most of the other ani-
   mals, are, with perhaps a few exceptions, precisely the same in
   number and character in this parish as they are in most of the
   parishes immediately adjoining.
      Pearls are occasionally found in the Doveran.  They are, how-
   ever, of very small size, and of no great brilliancy.
      Entomology.--On this head it may be mentioned that a few
   years ago, a large and beautiful specimen was found at Montblairy,
   in this parish, of the death's-head hawk-moth (Sphinx atropos).
   This insect is said to advance with the cultivation of the potato.
   Mr Duncan, in his History of British Moths (Naturalists' Library,
   Vol. xiv.) does not take notice of any example of it having been
   hitherto met with so far north.  The specimen now mentioned
   is in the possession of a gentleman in Banff.
      Botany.-- This parish possesses a highly interesting Flora; but,
   from a list of about 460 species transmitted by the writer, we have
   only room for the insertion of the following planter rariores:

   Adoxa moschatellina           Bidens cernua                  Epilobium angustifolium

   ed to the Rev. James Smith, Banff, a gentleman Eighly distinguished both in moral
   and natural science, is preserved along with the MS.
