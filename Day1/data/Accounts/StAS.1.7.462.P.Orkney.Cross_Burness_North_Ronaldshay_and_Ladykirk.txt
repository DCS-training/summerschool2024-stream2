     Statistical Account

   By the above statement of the population, in the 3 united
parishes of Crosskirk charge, it appears, that the population
in the two parishes of this charge, which lie in the isle of
Sanday, were precisely equal, at the two above mentioned pe-
riods, the one parish having increased two, and the other de-
creased two.  In the isle of North Ronaldshay, the increase
is 36; but from this we ought to deduct for a family of 9
persons, brought there to the light-house, and then there re-
main 27 increase from the inhabitants.  This increase is
probably owing to a greater number of marriages there of
late years, than is usually at an average, and consequently a
greater number of births.

Population in Ladykirk Parish, now vacant.
In 1755, the numbers were                                         750
In August 1787, by an exact enumeration, taken by the
   late incumbent's assistant, the number of souls in this
   parish were                                                    803

If it is wished to have the population of these islands sepa-   f
rately, it only remains to state them from the above thus:
April 26. 1791. The number of souls in Crosskirk parish
   were                                                           579
April 28. 1791. The number of souls in Burness parish,            390
August 1787. The number of souls in Ladykirk parish,               
   which is now vacant, were 803; and as the above                  
   two parishes are precisely the same as they were in             
   1787, we may suppose they are nearly the same in                
   this parish; say then in Ladykirk parish, which is
   vacant,                                                        803
                                                                 ----
        Total number of souls in the isle of Sanday,             1772
