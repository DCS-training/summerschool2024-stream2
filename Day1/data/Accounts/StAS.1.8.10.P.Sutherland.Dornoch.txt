comfortless lodgings, and scarcity of fuel*.  The common mode
of providing for winter firing here, is peculiarly injurious
to health.  During the season, in which the poor people
are employed in carrying it out of the hills, they go to the
moss, or so far in their way towards it in the evening; lie
out in the open air all night, and load their horses in the
morning.  The great distance, badness of the roads, weak-
ness of their horses, and scantiness of pasture, impose this cru-
el necessity.  There is no cart road to the moss, peat and turf
being carried by means of an aukward apparatus, on the backs
of small, half-starved horses.  In one or two districts of the
parish, the people begin to see the absurdity of this practice,
and have actually made some attempts towards a better 
within the last two years; but nothing like a competent road
has yet been executed.

   Roads and Bridges.-Nature has made the public roads here
passable:  they owe little to industry or police; the statute
labour has occasionally been exacted, but it has not been
applied with that constancy and vigour, which would ren-
der it efficient.  A commutation of it appears to be now in
contemplation, among the proprietors of this and some other
northern counties.  This parish is destitute of bridges; the
want of one is particularly felt at the river of Evelicks,
which is often not passable in winter.  A piece of ground,
in the vicinity of Dornoch, is said to have been destined by a
former public spirited proprietor, for the purpose of uphold-
ing a bridge on this river, and to have been left by him, un-
der the administration of the proprietor of a neighbouring estate.

Some, however, live to the age of 80, and some 90 years.
