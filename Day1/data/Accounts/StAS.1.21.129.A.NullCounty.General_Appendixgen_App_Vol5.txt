     The Statistical Account.

   I am sorry, I should have occasion to trouble Sir John Sin-
clair on such a subject, but I feel it to be my duty; and I
trust he will pay attention to it, as a just tribute of filial re-
spect to a father's good name, and an expression of proper
concern that the important work which owes its being to Sir-
John's patriotic exertions may be the vehicle only of truth.

     I have the honour to be, Sir,

     
     Your most obedient,

     
     and humble Servant,

     
     FORFAR,
     25. Dec. 1794. JOHN BRUCE.

     
     To Sir John Sinclair, Baronet.
