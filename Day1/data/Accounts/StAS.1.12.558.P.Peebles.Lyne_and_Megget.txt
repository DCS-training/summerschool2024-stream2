     Statistical Account

the inhabitants are more subject to rheumatisms, than to any
other complaint.  The water of Megget rises at the head of
the parish, and, after running the whole length of it, falls in-
to St. Mary's Loch, a beautiful expanse of fresh water.  This
loch, with the loch of the Lows, from which it is separated
by a narrow neck of land, may be near 5 miles long, and, in
some places, 2 1/2 broad.  Trout, pike, and eel, are found in
both; they are frequented by water-fowl of different kinds,
particularly by wild-ducks.  The quantity of grain raised in
Megget is very inconsiderable, and insufficient, even in the
best seasons, to maintain its inhabitants.  But the quantity
that Lyne can annually spare, would, upon an average, fully
answer all the demands of Megget.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the
number of souls in Lyne and Megget in 1755, was 265.  The
population of Lyne parish in the 1792, was 72.
