and the only point of contact is round the edge of the mouth of
the cap, when the thread passes to the bobbin. From this, and
the resistance of the air to the movement of the thread, the ten-
sio is derived,and is light and uniform. The spindle of the com-
mon throstle cannot be driven to advantage above 4000 or 5000
revolutions in a minute, whilst the Danforth socket may be run,
with advantage at 8000 or 9000. This machine has been slowly
getting into use, and suits to spin twist from tens to forties. The
yarn has a medium character, betwixt water-twist and, mule-twist.
The power required to turn this machine is great, and the tear
and wear of the machine considerable. Another American throstle
(which, however, was invented in Scotland thirty years ago,) was
introduced about four years ago, by Mr Montgomerie of Johnston.
It consists of a long central spindle, embraced by a double-necked
flur, and is said to work well, building the yarn in the form of a
cop, or on a bobbin, as may be required. Several are at work about
Glasgow. By these and other improvements in the various pro-
cesses of cotton spinning, as much yarn can now be spun for 5s.

	In the year 1797, a new machine for cleaning cotton was invent-
ed by Mr Neil Snodgrass, now of Glasgow, and first used at John-
ston, near Paisley, by Messrs Houston and Company. It is called
a skutching or blowing machine. Its merits were not sufficiently
known till 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced into Manchester.
About that period it received some improvements from Mr Ark-
wright, and Mr Strutt, who applied a fanner to create a strong
draft of air passing through a revolving wire sieve, where by the
dust and small flur separated from the cotton by the blows of the
skutcher is carried off, and thrown into a chamber, where it is de-
posited, or into the open air out of doors; whilst the opened cot-
ton is stopped by the sieve, arid, arranging into a fleecy form of
uniform thickness, passes by the revolution of the sieve to a roller,
when it is wound up, to be carried to the carding-engine.
	The most complete arrangement of this machine was made by

<FOOTNOTE>In November 1831, Dr Cleland ascertained, that in 44 mills in Lanarkshire, for
spinning cotton, there were 1344 spinners, 640,188 spindles, viz. 591,288 mules, and
48,000 throstles.
        On 21st July 1834, the total number of persons employed in the cotton, woollen,
flax, and silk mills in Scotland, was 46,825, of whom 13,721 (3799 males, and 9992
females) are between the ages of 13 and 18, and 6228 (2552 males, and 3676 females,)
are  under 13 years of age. There are few under 11. Their number, as stated in the
resources, amounts 1143; but that is not to be taken as the number now in the mills,
seem mill owners having discharged all under 11.-- Factory report, p.7.
