country is concerned, it would be, rather desirable that in
some spots they should fail entirely.  The irregularity thus
produced, the wandering inartificial line in which the foli-
age would then appear, would give an ease to the scenery,
which the formal squares and circles, used with such partia-
lity by custom to bound plantations, effectually destroy.
   Even were the trees not to rise to a great height, the
proprietor, though he could not be otherwise enriched by
them, would be indebted to the shelter they afforded to his
arable lands; and the country would wear almost as rich an
aspect, with its hills thus covered, as if they were crowned
with lofty wood.  On a rugged country this is peculiarly
beautiful.  A little distance always gives a fine effect, even
to the poorest plantations; the shortness of the wood the
eye cannot then accurately measure; while, at the same
time, the foliage seems deep, and the boldness of the
ground towers above its shade.

   Antiquities.-No ruins of any abbey or chapel, not even
the fragments of any remarkable building, give solemnity
to the scenery of the parish.  A few pretty large stones,
sunk in the top of one of its hills, have excited curiosity;
and the genius of antiquarianism, unaided by the informa-
tion which the country can afford, would probably find in
them the remnant of some camp or castle.  The less splen-
did, but the more just account of the inhabitants, makes
them part of some common decayed fence.
   Scarcely a mile to the N. of Kilmany, there is a romantic
rocky den, cut deep in the face of the mountain.  It has
probably been gradually worn down by the successive tor-
rents, which the heavy rains in winter throw from the

continued, in 20 years the face of this part of the country will be completely
changed.
