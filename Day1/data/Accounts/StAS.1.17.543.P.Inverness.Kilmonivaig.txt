     NUMBER XXXIX.

     PARISH OF KILMANIVAIG.

     (COUNTY OF INVERNESS.-PRESBYTERY OF ABER-
     TARPH, AND SYNOD OF GLENELG.)

     By Mr THOMAS Ross, Minister.

     Extent.

   THE length of this parish, from south to north, is about
60 miles, and its greatest breadth 20.  It is bounded
by the parish of Kilmalie to the west, by Fortingal to the
south east, by Laggan to the east, by Glenelg and Kintail to
the north, and by Boleskine to the north east.  Its appear-
ance is very much diversified by ranges of lofty mountains
towards the extremities, interfected by extensive glens in dif-
ferent directions, and rapid rivers, which all discharge them-
selves into the river Lochy, the common reservoir, which
runs into a branch of the Atlantic at Fort-William.

   Climate.-From the vicinity of this parish to the western
ocean, and its being surrounded by very high mountains,
which attract the clouds, the climate is extremely rainy;
consequently, the inhabitants, though in other respects
healthy, are frequently troubled with the rheumatism.
