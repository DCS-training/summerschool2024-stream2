which deducted from 1,527,892, the total number of inha-
bitants in Scotland, (See page 473,) leaves 982,167.  But it is
to be observed, that several considerable towns and villages
are omitted in the above lift, the number of inhabitants in
them not having been specified in the statistical returns.
Adding 100,000 more for the population of these towns and
villages, makes a total of 645,725, consequently there re-
mains 882, 167 inhabitants in the country, in hamlets, and in
villages, containing less than 300 souls.
