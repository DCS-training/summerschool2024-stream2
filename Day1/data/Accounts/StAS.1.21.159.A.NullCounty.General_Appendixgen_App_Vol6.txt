     The Statistical Account.

to which end nothing less is requisite than the total abolition
of the moss.
   By the methods above described from 100 to 200 acres of
moss had been removed.  When the present plan was intro-
duced, there still remained covered with moss from 1300 to
1400 acres of carse clay-a treasure for which it must be
ever interesting to dig.
   In the year 1766 Lord Kames entered into possession of
the estate of Blair Drummond.  Long before that period he
was well acquainted with the moss, and often lamented that
no attempt had ever been made to turn it to advantage.  Ma-
ny different plans were now proposed; at length it was re-
solved to attempt, by means of water as the most powerful
agent, entirely to sweep off the whole body of moss.
   That moss might be floated in water, was abundantly ob-
vious; but to find water in sufficient quantity was difficult,
the only stream at hand being employed to turn a corn-mill.
Convinced of the superior consequence of dedicating this
stream to the purpose of floating off the moss, Lord Kames
having made an agreement with the tenant who farmed the
mill, and the tenants thirled consenting to pay the rent, he
immediately threw down the mill, and applied the water to
the above purpose.
   In order to determine the best manner of conducting the
operation, workmen were now employed for a considerable
time upon the Low Moss both by the day and by the piece,
to ascertain the expence for which a given quantity of moss
could be removed.  It was then agreed to operate at a cer-
tain rate per acre; and in this manner several acres were re-
moved.
   But this was to be a very expensive process.  The ground
gained might, indeed, be afterwards let to tenants; but eve-
ry acre would require an expenditure from 12 L. to 15 L. before
