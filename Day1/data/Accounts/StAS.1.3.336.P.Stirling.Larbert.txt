at Larbert, another at Braes, in the parish of Dunipace, and
a third in Upper Porwood.  There are two artificial mounts
in the parish of Dunipace, near the church.  They are up-
wards of 60 feet high, and raised in a conical form.  The
reason of raising them is said to be for a memorial of a peace
which had been concluded there between the Romans and
Scots*.  A part of one of the mounts, towards the west was
carried away (as Buchanan says, by a stood in the river Car-
ron.  At what time this happened is uncertain; but the
course which the river had then taken, when it made this
encroachment on the mount is still visible.  The great Ro-
man Causeway from Carmuirs, (where the Roman camp was,
in the parish of Falkirk), which crossed the river Carron by
a bridge, west of the village of Larbert, and went almost in a
straight line to the castle of Stirling, is still entire in many
parts, both in the parish of Larbert and Dunipace.  In
Dunipace parish is the famous Torwood; in the middle of
which there are the remains of Wallace's tree, an oak which,
according to a measurement, when entire, was said to be
about 12 feet diameter.  To this wood Wallace is said to
have fled, and secreted himself in the body of that tree, then
hollow, after his defeat in the north.  Adjoining to this
is a square field, inclosed by a ditch, where Mr Donald
Cargill excommunicated King Charles II.

the principal of which is the parish school in Stenhouse-
muir.  The number of scholars, in general, is between 60
and 70.  The annual salary is 100 L.  Scotch, and 1 L. Ster-

*The name of the parish is supposed to originate from these
two hills.  They were the Dunes pacis or hills of peace.
