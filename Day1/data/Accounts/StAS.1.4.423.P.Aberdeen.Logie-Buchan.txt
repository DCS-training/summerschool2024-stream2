which can answer the purpose of bait.  The muscles are
in season from September to April; but as the muscle
bed lies in the parish of Foveran, I shall add no more up-
on the subject,as it will perhaps be only anticipating what
may be said more properly in the account of the parish.
The salmon sell in the beginning of the season at 6 d. the
lb. and as the season advances, they fall to 4 d. 3 d. and
even to 2 1/2 d. if they are plentiful.-  The shells, which con-
tains pearl, are pretty often found in this river.  I have
not indeed heard of any pearls having been found in them
for these 16 or 17 years; but I am informed from good
authority, that a few years before that, several were got
by people keeping cattle upon the water side, and that
some of these were of considerable value.  A circumstance
has come to my knowledge within these few days, which
shews, that the pearl fishery of this river was considered
as an object of greater value some time ago, than it has
been for these several years past; namely, that one of the
predecessors of Mr Buchan of Auchmacoy has obtained
a patent for it; and in the list of unprinted acts of 1st
Parliament of Charles I. anno 1633, there is an act, "re
"pealing the patent for the pear fishery, granted to Ro-
"bert Buchan."  Ythan is not a large river, but the tide
flows for more than 4 miles up, and is navigable to small
craft for more than 3, which is a great accommodation
to the neighbouring country.  About half a mile below
this church, the tide flows out into a broad bason, and
covers a piece of land to the extent of 90 acres, called the
Sleek of Tartie; part of the surface is green, and produ-
ces a fine shorts grass, which is very fattening both for
black cattle and horses.  The soil is mixed with shells, 
and the farmers use is as a manure with great advantage;
they lay it on, and spread it on the ground in autumn
