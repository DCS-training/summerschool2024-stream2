     Statistical Account

   All the inhabitants of this parish are of the established
church, two Seceders excepted, and ten families, which are
either partly, or wholly, of the Episcopial persuasion.  These
have here no fixed clergyman; but they have the oridinances
of religion occasionally dispensed among them, by ministers
from other parts of the country.

   Houses and their Inhabitants.-The inhabited houses of e-
very description in the parish amount to 239, but of such as
are well built, and have two stories, to about 40.  Of the
smaller and middling kinds, a good number has been built
within these ten years past; but as many others of the same
sort have been removed by the converting of several small
into three larger farms, there has probably been so very con-
siderable increase of their number.  Of the better kind of 
houses, which are let at from L. 7 to L. 16 per annum,
about seventeen have been built in the above period.  In
this account, however, houses are not included which have
been erected on the sites of others gone to decay, but such
only as were built where no houses of the same size were
before, and so make an addition to the total number of hou-
ses in the parish.  There is no uninhabited house, or cottage
in the town or neighbourhood.  The demand, on the con-
trary, for houses, particularly for the middling sort, is very
great.  At an average the number of inhabitants to each
house is 5 3/4.

   Agriculture, Produce, etc.-The greater part of the parish
is arable, and produces corn of different kinds, chiefly oats,

the quarrels and breaches of the peace among the inhabitants,
were very frequent, and often furnished a good harvest to the
Dingwall procurators.  But now that this course of business has
in a great measure failed, the people have become much more
peaceable.
