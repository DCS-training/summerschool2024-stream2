     of Snizort.

   At the bottom of one of those high rocks, and at a small
distance from it, on the east side, is a huge perpendicular stone,
or natural obelisk of uncommon height and magnitude, which,
when seen from a distance, very much resembles a large
steeple.  This stone is about 360 feet in circumference at the
base; a little below the middle it is a good deal rounder, and
thence lessening upwards, seems to end nearly in a sharp
point; its height is thought to exceed three hundred feet.
   There is also in the same side of the parish, in the march be-
tween it and the parish of Portree, a beautiful fall of water, or
cataract, the perpendicular height of which may be about ninety
feet; what is most remarkable relative to this fall, is, that
nearly opposite to the middle of it, there is an arched hollow
path across the rock, along which five or six people may walk
abreast with the greatest safety, quite secure from and unmo-
lested by the body of water that rolls over them, and which
in this situation they might mistake for a thick pillar of close
smoke, did they not see it dash upon the rocks below.

   Diseases, etc.-No local sickness or distempers of any kind
are prevalent in the parish.  In a wet open season, rheuma-
tism, coughs, and colds, are frequent; some epidemical fevers
appear too, and are at times mortal.  The winter and springs
are generally damp, cold, and piercing.  The air, however,
on the whole, is not thought unsalubrious, and some instances
of longevity tend to confirm the opinion; five or six people
have died within the last two years, whose respective ages
were from eighty-four to ninety, and many are now living in
this district above eighty years of age.

   Rents, etc.-There are six proprietors, four of whom have
become proprietors in the year 1779, at which time they feued
that district of the parish that was formerly the sole property
