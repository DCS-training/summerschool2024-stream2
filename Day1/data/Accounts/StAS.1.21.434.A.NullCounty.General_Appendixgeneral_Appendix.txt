but unfortunately, owing to the inattention of those con-
cerned, they have gone a little farther on one estate, which
has involved me in a process of reduction, which is still in
dependence.
   The glebe, including garden, stance of houses, etc. mea-
sures only five acres and a quarter; and, on the pasture, the
river Dee has made such incroachments, that the heritors
have for many years been in the practice of granting some
allowance in money to the incumbent.
   With respect to the management of such a glebe, I shall
only observe, that, after having tried different schemes, in a
period of five or six years, I found that I purchased the ac-
commodations which it afforded at a very high rate.  This
determined me to become tacksman of a small adjoining
farm which happened to be vacant; and which, with the
glebe, gives employment to a couple of horses.  So that now
the question with me is not, what is the most profitable
mode of managing a small glebe?  but, what is the most pro-
fitable mode of managing a small farm consisting of between
30 and 40 acres?  a question, the discussion of which, were
I equal to the task, would encroach upon your patience.
   I shall however take this opportunity of remarking, that,
on such a farm, it must be of the utmost importance to raise
the weightiest green crops possible; on this account, broad-
cast turnips are to be preferred, as affording from one third
to one fourth more per acre, cateris paribus, than those which
are horse-drilled.  But, to hoe broad-cast turnips well, is a
very nice operation.  A turnip, when young, is a very deli-
cate plant; and if earth is thrown upon it with the hoe,
especially in wet weather, and it happens immediately after to
be trod upon, it never recovers.  To obviate this, and other
inconveniences attending broad-cast, I have, for five or six
years, sown my turnips with a hand drill, which, at each time
