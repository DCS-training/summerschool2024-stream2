for which reason, in country parishes, they are generally 
obliged to put up with such as have not had the opportuni-

may be sufficient to support the inhabitants.  The farmers
now begin to raise hay, turnips, and potatoes; but oats and 
bear are the chief produce of this part of the country.  A

farms, which, during the summer months, generally pasture
