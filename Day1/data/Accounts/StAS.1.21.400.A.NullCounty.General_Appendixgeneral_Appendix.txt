   It is not now the custom of the parishioners to plough
the clergyman's glebe, or to carry his fuel; nor is it perhaps
fit that such customs should subsist; being, so far as they go,
destructive of that independence which it is certainly the
great intention of an establishment to support.  As matters

from preventing embarrassment by supplying conveniency,
must necessarily occasion infinitely more distraction to the
clergyman in its management, than a large farm under direc-

fitable waste of labour.
   The original intention of the Legislature is not now,

to the existing circumstances.
   To answer that intention, it would be necessary that
glebes should be augmented to such proper size of a farm,
as would fully occupy (including carriage of fuel) a man-ser-
vant and a couple of working horses; affording also keeping
for a horse or poney used solely for riding:  As also to sup-

suffice for the extent of land.
   The glebe might be augmented from the land most con-
venient; recourse being vested in the proprietor whose
lands were allocated against the other heritors, and a propor-
