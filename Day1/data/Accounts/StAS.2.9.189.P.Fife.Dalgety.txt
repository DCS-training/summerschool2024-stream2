  Character, &c. of the People.-The people in general are very
sober and industrious. Those of them who are not employed in the
coal-works consist principally of labourers and firm-servants. The
colliers who compose such a large proportion of the parishioners
are, with a few exceptions, the most sober and civilized of that class
of the community any where to be found. They are quite a dis-
tinct class from the agricultural population. Their prejudices, their
domestic habits, and even their style of dress are altogether pecu-
liar. So completely have they kept themselves apart, and so much
have intermarriages prevailed, that for centuries back the same
family names have generally obtained amongst them. The ame-
liorated condition of the, Fordel colliers, when compared with that
of many others, is principally to be traced to the effects of educa-
tion. Before the parish school was removed to their immediate
neighbourhood, where it has been for upwards of thirty years, it was
their uniform practice to maintain by subscription a teacher amongst
themselves. This fact may be of some importance to those pro-
prietors, many of whose colliers are so far behind the other classes
of the community, both as regards general education and moral
improvement.

  Agriculture.-Agriculture is generally, in a very improved state
in this parish. Its situation affords the farmer many advantages.
There is abundance of lime in the Deighbourbood. Fuel is very
moderate in . price, and manure to any extent can be obtained from
Leith by water carriage. As the soil, especially toward the northern
parts of the parish, is naturally wet, draining has been much resort-
ed to, and with the most beneficial effects. Such a complete change
have some of the lands on the estate of Fordel undergone that a
farm, which twenty years ago brought only a rental of L. 15, now
