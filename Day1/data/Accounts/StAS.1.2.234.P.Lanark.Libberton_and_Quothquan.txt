ance, that the eastern and western parts of it, are a striking
contrast to each other.  That which lies towards the west, on
the banks of the Clyde, is, perhaps, the most fertile spot in all
the neighbourhood.  Much of its fertility is, no doubt, ow-
ing to the inundations of the Clyde, which overflows the low-
er grounds, or, as they called in this country, the Haughs, of-
ten a dozen of times in the year.-The soil is a deep rich
clay; and from time immemorial, has been cultivated for
common crops, without receiving the smallest particle of dung.
The eastern tract of the parish, is an irregular part of varied
grounds.  Though it be raised considerably above the level
of the Clyde, yet it is not so high, as to deserve the name of
mountainous; being, throughout its whole extent, a waved
tract of ground, covered with heath, and, in some places,

north and south Methven.  The north branch takes its rise
near Crosswood-hill, the partition which divides the county of
west Lothian, from that of Clydesdale:  the south, near Gar-
velfoot, in the parish of Linton.  These two branches form a
junction in this parish, within a mile and a half of the Clyde,
and are a great accession to the waters of the rapid river.  It
is here, perhaps, necessary to observe, that there is a small
branch of the south Methven, which runs off towards the east,
near Garvelfoot, and dividing at Dolphington, the counties of
Clydesdale and Tweedale, falls into the Tweed.  This parti-
