for shipping, along the Tay, a ready market is found for all
its produce.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-The average prices of
grain are, wheat 21 s. per boll; barley and meal, 15 s.; and
pease and beans, 14 s.  Other provisions are regulated by the
Perth market.  The wages of men servants, employed in
husbandry, are from 8 l. to 10 l. when they live in the fami-

culture, is doubtless friendly to the population of the coun-
try, and the morals of the people, though it may be ques-

people.  The coals are all brought by water carriage up the
river, from different part of Fife.  The price paid for them
at the port, when delivered, is seldom above 4 s. per boll,
which consists of 52 stone weight, and the people in general
are well supplied.

   Rent.-The general rent of the land at present, is from
25 s. to 30 s. per acre; but some ground lately let at above
