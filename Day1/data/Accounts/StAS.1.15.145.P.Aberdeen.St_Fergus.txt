by draining, and planting lurch and spruce firs for nurseries,
other trees may be brought up.  Many drains have already
been made, and several thousands of larches and spruces have
been planted, and the same improvements are carrying on
through the whole.

   Roads and Bridge.-The principal roads, through this pa-
rish, are those leading from Peterhead to Fraserburgh and
Banff, and from Peterhead to Old Deer.  They are kept in
tolerable repair by the statute labour, but will never be
good roads until turnpikes are established.  It is not to be
imagined that any man will work a day on the roads, when
he may redeem his labour for 3 d.  If ever a mail coach be
established, for the accommodation of the country north of
Aberdeen, the course must be by the coast side, at least in
winter, as the other road by Fyvie is often impassable, on ac-
count of the depth of the snow; and the certainty of pas-
sengers, from the towns on the coast, especially at Peterhead,
where there is always a great resort of company for the
benefit of the mineral well, will make the road by the coast
side eligible in summer.  The only bridge in this parish is
that over the Ugie, on the road from Peterhead to Fraserburgh
and Banff.  It consists of two arches.  This bridge was built,
in consequence of an act of Parliament for that effect, in the
reign of James the VII. of Scotland, and II. of England.* 

   Ecclesiastical State.-This parish is one of the 32 the tithes
and patronage whereof belonged to the Abbey of Arbroath. ^^
