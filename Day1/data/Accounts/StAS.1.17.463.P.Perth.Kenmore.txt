in the church, which, in this parish, communibus annis, a-
mount to 32 L.  Besides this, they have 5 L. yearly, being the
interest of 100 L. which was mortified, about 60 years ago, for
their behoof, by a near relation of the noble family of Bread-
albane.  They have also another small sum at interest, which
the kirk-session have been enabled, in times of plenty, to save
out of the funds.  The noble proprietors already mentioned,
have, besides, been long in the practice of distributing yearly,
in the district of Breadalbane, from between 90 to 100 bolls
of meal, to widows and orphans, and to aged and infirm
persons in indigent circumstances, though not on the poor-
roll.  This meal has lately been converted into money, at
16 s. the boll.

   Population.-This parish seems to have undergone no con-
siderable change, with respect to population, for some time
past.  The districts along the sides of Loch Tay have, from
time immemorial, been remarkably populous.  In these
place, the tenants, in general, have but very small posses-
sions, several of them being crowded together in the same
farm.  And although it is certain that the noble proprietor
might increase his rent-roll considerably, by enlarging the
possessions and lessening the number of tenants, yet, know-
ing their attachment to their country, he allows them to re-
main in the abodes of their forefathers.  The only villages
in the parish are Kenmore and Stronsernan, the latter of
which was built a few years ago, and consists of about 24 fa-
milies.
   It appears, by the return made to Dr Webster in the year
1755, that the population of the parish was then 3067.  By
a survey taken in 1794-5, the population amounts to 3463.
Of these 1520 are males, and 1943 are females.  The ave-
rage number of marriages yearly is 24, and of births 60.
