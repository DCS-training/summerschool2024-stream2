While the number of souls in the parish, in general, has di-
minished, the population of the village of Athelstaneford has
increased very much.  In the 1778, the number of inhabi-

the number of inhabited house is 92, containing 387 inha-
bitants, an increase of 21 houses and 92 souls.  The increase
of buildings and of inhabitants in the village is owing to the
liberal encouragement given by Sir David Kinloch of Gil-
merton, the proprietor, to people to settle on his estate.
The houses are built upon a feu-tack of 38 years, at the ex-
pence of the people, who pay to the proprietor a trisle an-

have large gardens, of an excellent soil, at the same propor-
tion of rent which a farmer would chearfully pay for it.
Besides this, the feuers of these houses hold, in a conjunct
lease, about 100 on acres of good land at a moderate rent.  This
