which all of them now hold, and are commonly granted for
19 years; and likewise by their release from various burdens
formerly imposed.  On several of the greatest estates, the te-
nants were then, or a few years earlier, bound to carry out the
dung, to plow and harrow all the lands possessed by the he-
ritor (whom they all called, and still through habit call their
masters but more frequently the laird) to cut, dry, and carry
home his peats, and all the coals used by his family; to cut,
win, and stack his hay; to cut down, carry home, and stack
corns; to carry bark and farm meal to any unlimited distance
where the factor sold these articles, but rarely above 12 or 20
miles; to go each in their turn with a horse or cart to Perth
or Crief, or longer journies when required, and all at their
own charge, without any allowance of food for man or beast.
   These services were emphatically stiled bondage, particular-
ly the manual labour at peats, hay, and harvest; working
with a horse was called carriage; and these two species of
labour, were, in the old tack, distinguished by the names of
barrage and carrage.  One heritor has some of his tenants
still bound to part of these services, such as winning and
stacking hay, shearing in harvests and carrying coals and
lime to a certain extent; but the other heritors require no
services, except the carriage of coals and bark.  Most of the
tenants are now likewise released from the servitude of thir-
lage, by which they were obliged to grind at a particular
miln, and to pay very high duties.  There are five corn
milns in the parish, belonging to different heritors, and each
heritor has relieved his own tenants from the high duties,
on dividing among them the old miln rent.  To these the
miln duties amount to about the 30th peck; a few tenants
that are still bound to a miln on another estate, pay at least
a twelfth part of what they grind at it.
