     NUMBER XLVI.

     PARISH OF CRANSHAWS.

     (PRESBYTERY OF DUNSE, SYNOD OF MERSE AND
     TIVIOTDALE, COUNTY OF BERWICK.)

     By the Rev. MR. GEORGE DRUMMOND.

     Name, and Situation.

   There is no certain account, nor even any conjecture
which has the least appearance of probability, with re-
gard to the origin of the name of this parish.-Part of the
parish of Longformacus intersects it in the middle; so that one
half, and indeed the largest half of this district, lies at the dis-
tance of 4 or 5 miles from the church.  An inconvenience
which attends many parishes in this part of the country.

   Population.There are only 164 inhabitants in the parish,
of whom 84 are males and 80 females.  The population of
this, and many of the neighbouring parishes, has of late con-
siderably diminished.  The only reason that can be assigned
for this diminution is the monopoly of farms.  About 50 or 60
years ago there were above 16 farmers in the parish; the whole 
is now in the possession of 3 only.  The return to Dr. Webster
in 1754 was 214 souls.
