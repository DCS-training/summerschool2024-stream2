   Miscellaneous Observations.-The valued rent of the parish,
amounts to L. 7445: 6: 8 d. Scotch-The old church of A-
berlady was a disgrace to the parish; it measured 100 feet in
length, by 16 1/2 feet in breadth, and was betwixt 10 and 11
feet in height; the walls were partly built of mud, and the
floor was some feet larger than the surface of the ground
without.  In 1773 the inheritors built a very commodious
church, adjoining to what are two ailes, in one of which is
a monument to the memory of Lady North and Grey, wife
of Patrick Lord Elsbark, with an incription composed by his
Lorship, who was proprietor of Balncrieff, the most exten-
sive barony in the parish.  The Earl of Portmore in patron.
