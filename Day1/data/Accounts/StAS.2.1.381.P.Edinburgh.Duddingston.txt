                    PARISH OF DUDDINGSTON.*

        PRESBYTERY OF EDINBURGH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.

           THE REV. JAMES MACFARLANE, MINISTER.

            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name. -The name of this parish was written in the charters of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Dodinestun,-being evi-
dently derived from the settlement here of a person designed Do-
din, whose (tun, Sax.) or town it was during the reigns of David I.
and Malcolm IV. This fact is established by a charter of William
de Vetere Ponte, granted to the canons of Holyrood, to which
"Hugo Filius Dodini de Dodinestun" appears to have been a
witness.
  Extent and Boundaries.-This parish is bounded on the south
by part of the parishes of Inveresk and Libberton; on the west and
north, by St Cuthbert's, Canongate, and South Leith; and on the
east, by the Frith of Forth. It contains 1450 Scotch acres, or
1812 1/2 imperial, or two square miles and a half; it extends from
west to east three miles, and from north to south nearly one mile
and a half. It is of an irregular figure, and resembles a wedge in
shape, with the broad end towards Arthur's Seat.
  Topographical Appearances.-The general appearance is level,
with a gentle slope descending from the base of Arthur's Seat
towards the Frith of Forth. The soil, in general, is rather poor;
and consists of a brownish-coloured earth, seldom more than six-
teen inches in depth, and frequently not so much. Towards the
east, it rests on a strong clay, and along the sea-coast, it is of a
light sandy nature. There is not a parish in Scotland more high-
ly cultivated, nor one which resembles more the rich chalpaign of
England in its general aspect. The whole, with the exception of
a few acres, is arable.
