It is, however, more than probable this wall never extend-
ed to Abercorn.  The authority of the venerable Bede,
when we recollect the age in which he lived, and the op-
portunity of knowledge which, as a Northumbrian, he pos-
sessed, has not been sufficiently attended to upon this point,
concerning which there has been considerable investigation.
"Incipit autem duorum ferme millium spatio a Monaste-
"rio Aebercurnig ad occidentem, in loco qui fermone Pic-

lib. 1. cap. xii.  The name given by both nations to the
place where the wall began, implies a point, and the point
of Blackness is precisely the distance mentioned from the
church of Abercorn, where, it is understood, the monastery
was situated.

   Monastery, etc.-The monastery of Abercorn was one
of the most ancient in Scotland.  It is several times men-
tioned by Bede, though he gives no particular account of
it.  Towards the end of the seventh century, it was the
residence of a bishop Triumvin.  At this period the terri-
tory of the Northumbrians extended to the Frith of Forth;
but in the year 684, AEgfrid their king was defeated and
slain by the Picts, on which Triumvin left Abercorn*; and
from that time it is uncertain whether the monastery con-
tinued, as there seems to be nothing recorded in history
with respect to it.  To this old religious establishment we
must refer the names of many places in the parish, such as
Priestinch, St Serf's Law, Priest's Folly, &c. &c.
   About the year 1170, a dispute arose concerning the pa-
tronage of the church of Abercorn, between John Avenale,
