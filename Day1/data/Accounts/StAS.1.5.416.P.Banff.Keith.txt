and seems well adapted to the soil of Keith.  Could a rea-
dy market be found for it, as it comes rough from the
mills, (of which there are 3 in the parish), the quantity
raised would be inconceivably increased.  The manufactu-
rers, wishing, (as is supposed, by those who have considered
the subject most attentively), to monopolize the flax trade,
discourage the raising flax at home, as much as possible, by
using none but Dutch flax.  The parish abounds in stone,
which, in most places, may easily be obtained, only by 
digging a few feet; though not of an excellent quality, it 
answers tolerably well for building and inclosures.  It has also
plenty of a coarse gray slate, fit enough for slating houses.
Limestone is to be had in abundance, on almost every
farm, with plenty of peats at a moderate distance, for con-
verting it to the purposes of building or agriculture.  Not-
withstanding that great advantage, agriculture is here just
in its infancy; the long drawling team of 8 or 10 oxen
in yokes, sometimes preceded by a couple of horses, is
yet often to be seen creeping along, dragging after them
an immense log of a clumsy Scotch plough; when 2, or at
most 4 good horses, or even good oxen in collars, with
the modern light plough, (which has been found to an-
swer well by those who have tried it), would perform the
same work, equally well, in a much shorter time. This
last mode begins now to take place, particularly about the 
village.  The farmers have at last perceived the advantage 
of a proper rotation of crops, and of cultivating such as
are green, though, for want of inclosures, they can only
be cultivated in an imperfect manner.  A considerable 
quantity of the produce of the parish is exported.  Were 
not that the case, it is believed, that populous as it is, it
could maintain its own inhabitants.  It has several mine-
ral springs of the chalybeate kind, sending forth large
streams of pleasant water, which, upon trial, has been
