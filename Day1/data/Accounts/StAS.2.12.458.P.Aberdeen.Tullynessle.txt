the same period is L. 22, 7s. 5d.  This is exclusive of collections
for particular purposes; such as the Destitution in the High-
lands, and the four Assembly Schemes; the average of which
for the five years is L. 7, 17s. 3d.  The session are in posses-
sion of funds to the amount of something more than L. 300
Sterling.  L. 100 of this sum was left them about twenty years
ago, by a journeyman bookbinder in London, in gratitude for the
education he had received at the parish school here; and, as he
himself states in his latter will, " to be an example to others."
   The poor receive aid partly in meal and partly in money.
When sick, they are attended by the district-surgeon, to whom
the session are in the habit of giving a slight compensation for his
trouble.  For some years past, it has been the practice at the com-
mencement of winter, to purchase for the necessitous and their fa-
milies, whether on the poor's roll or otherwise, such articles of
clothing and bedding as they stand most in want of.
   Of itself, our aid would do little towards the comfortable support
of those who need it.  But our poor are pretty equally divided
over the parish, and around each of them there is a charitable
circle, which readily supplies the deficiency.  In cases of unlook-
ed for disaster or severe affliction, when requisite, there are always
in the neighbourhood some benevolent individuals, who are ready
to start on the errand of mercy through the parish, and never fail
in procuring the necessary relief.  At present, the parochial ma-
chinery for the care of the poor is in full and undisturbed opera-
tion.  Long may it continue so.
