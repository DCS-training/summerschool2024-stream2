     of Kilmadock or Doune.

whole was called the Abthane.  So the title Earl being in-
troduced by Malcolm in place of Thane, the Lord High-
steward was in room of the Abthane.
   From this Walter, Lord High-steward, the family of Stu-
arts, that reigned so long over Scotland arose; and though
there was no doubt a Thane of Monteith before the time of
Walter, yet the high dignity conferred on this nobleman
affords ample room to conjecture, that the present magnifi-
cent castle of Doune was begun, and perhaps finished, in
his time.  What strengthens this still more is, that Mal-
colm and his four sons, Duncan II. Edgar, Alexander I.
and David I. who reigned successively over Scotland during
a period of 87 years, cultivated the arts of peace, and so af-
forded leisure for such extensive buildings as the castle of
Doune.  David was himself a very great friend to archi-
tecture, having built the noble church at Dunblane, and se-
veral others.
   Tradition, however, reports, that the Castle of Doune was
built by Murdac Duke of Albany, and Earl of Monteith
and Fife.  But, however much we may be disposed to give
credit to local tradition, yet the account of the life of this
unfortunate nobleman leaves great room to doubt how far
it was possible for him to rear such an edifice.  At that
time, no doubt, the power of such a nobleman was great;
and, having his vassals and dependants ready at his call, he
could make a strong effort to rear buildings in a short time;
but such a vast building as the Castle of Doune could not be
finished for many years.
   Murdac was son of Robert, who was son of Robert II.
King of Scotland.  Robert was created Earl of Monteith,
anno 1370; and in 1398 he was created Duke of Albany;
and in 1406 he succeeded to the government,on the death
of his brother Robert III. and governed Scotland 15 years.
