crease, upon the whole, in 35 years, from 1755 to 1790, is
288.  The above mentioned decrease, is owing chiefly to two
or more farms being turned into one; a practice not uncom-
mon here.  The births, at an average, are 70; the marriages
25; the deaths cannot be ascertained, no register of them
having been kept.  There is a Chapel of Ease, and an Epis-
copal meeting house in the N. part of the parish.  The num-
ber of Episcopalians is about 400:  they are an obliging, peace-
able, decent set of people, and live in good habits with those
of the Establishment.  There are no other sectaries in the parish.

   Church, School, and Poor.-Formerly Earl Marischal was
patron of the parish; but upon the forfeiture of the titles and
estate of that family in 1715, the right of patronage de-
volved to the King.  The church is old, inconvenient, and
unfit to contain the congregation, when fully assembled toge-
ther.  It is 94 feet in length, within walls, and 19 in breadth.
Opposite to the pulpit, there is an aile, which is of service
to the preacher, by enabling him to speak with greater ease.
The aile was built in 1720; but when the church was built,
is not known, there being no date upon it.  Neither walls
nor roof are plastered; and as the floor is from 3 to 4 feet
lower than the surface of the ground on the outside of the
walls, pools of water stand in the area several days after a
heavy rain.  The burying-ground is much larger than any
in this part of the country.  There are about 250 tomb or
grave stones in it, some of which are of an ancient date; and
a few have very fine engravings upon them, done by a Mr.
Cresswell, a farmer in the parish, who could not form a single
letter with the pen.  The manse was built in 1726, and has
undergone few repairs, excepting new windows in 1784
