down with gun-powder, about one half being left to support
the strata above.

   Fossils.-Fossil shells, and other marine exuviae, are found
in great quantities in all our lime quarries; such as entrochi,
which are numerous; anomiae, both with the perforated and
entire beak; gryphites; milliperes; fungites; several varie-
ties of pectens, and many others, which do not exist in their
natural state upon our shores.  All these abound in the lime-
quarry at Floors, the property of Mr Houstoun of Johnstoun,
and are generally found contained in a stratum of white clay
immediately incumbent on the lime.  Corals and shells have
been found in sinking the shafts for the Hawkhead coal; the
former in detached pieces of limestone, a few feet from the
surface; the latter involved in the mass of schistus immedi-
ately over the coal, and at a depth of not less than 160 feet.
Among these are the ortho-ceratites, turbinated cochleae, and
several species of bivalves; all of them retaining their origi-
nal form, and shining like the marcasite in common slate.-
In sinking a shaft for that coal in 1786, the several strata oc-
curred as follows:
