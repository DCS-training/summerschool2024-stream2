   Modern Buildins.-The House of Drum, which adjoins the
tower, is a large and spacious mansion.  It was erected in 1619,
and belongs to the Elizabethan style of architecture.  Several im-
portant alterations were made upon it, at different times, by the
present proprietor, who also removed the garden to a more suit-
able distance, and effected many great improvements on the plea-
sure grounds.  The House of Park is a beautiful Grecian building,
and was erected by the late proprietor in 1822, who also laid out
the garden and surrounding policies with much taste and judgment.

                       III.-Population.
   The last Statistical Account of this parish contains the amount
of its population at different dates from the time of Dr Webster's
Report in 1755 to the year 1790; from which we learn, that it
amounted at the latter period to 708, of whom 321 were males
and 387 females.  The following table shows the-state of the po-
population since that time:-

<TABLE>
	Population in 1795,	-	664
	              1797,	-	667
                    1801,	-	648
	              1821,	-	756
	              1831,	-	804
                    1841,	-	804

   The increase which has taken place is to be attributed chiefly to
the agricultural improvement of the parish; much waste land having
been reclaimed and formed into new tenements.
