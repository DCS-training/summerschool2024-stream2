   annually. The manse was built in 1801 or 1802. It is in a to-
   lerable state of repair, and affords about the average accommoda-
   tion of manses.
      Education.-There were four schools last winter, one paro-
   chial, three private.  Of the latter, one taught by an old wo-
   man, affords instruction in English reading only.  If these schools
   were permanent, tbev would be amply sufficient.  But the emolu-
   ments of the private schools are inadequate to secure the services
   of qualified teachers throughout the year.  One good school is
   wanted. Salary of the parochial schonlmaster, L.29, 18s. 9 10/12d.,
   additional do. in lieu of a garden, L.2, 2s. 9 3/12d.; in all, L.32,
   1s. 7 5/12d. Fees amount to about L.4 per annum. From session-
   clerkship, &c. say L.2 per annum. This parish is also entitled to
   participate in the Dick bequest.
      Poor.-The number for the last three years on the ordinary
   roll and their dependents, 14; receiving occasional aid, 10; total,
   24.  To ordinary paupers the amount allotted is L.2, 1s. 9 1/2d.,
   occasional aid, 9s. 2d.; average of both classes, L.1, 8s. per an-
   num, on an average of the last three years.  On an average of the
   last three years, the amount raised for the poor from church col-
   lections was L.10, 5s. 9 3/4d. per annum; from alms or legacies,
   L.11, 16s. 5d. including the interest of some accumulated funds.
   There is no legal assessment.
