   a life of the above-mentioned illustrious monarch;-a portrait of
   Bonaparte, when first consul, by Le Fevre;-a singular portrait,
   300 years old, of Barbara, Countess of Flanders, painted on a green
   ground, and supposed from this and other circumstances to be
   from the pencil of Holbein;-portraits of the Prince of Orange
   and of the Duke of Alva, &c.
   	About half a mile below Montblairy, on the opposite side of the
   river, stands the house of Dunlugas, the property of Hans George
   Leslie Esq. This house, built of granite, in 1793, consists of
   three stories, and is substantial, commodious, and elegant. With
   the exception of Duff House, perhaps no residence in the county
   of Banff is more delightfully situated. A beautiful and extensive
   lawn, partially adorned with lofty trees, which are tastefully dispos-
   ed for effect, stretches in front to the margin of the river, and the
   ground, rising somewhat abruptly behind, is covered chiefly with
   thriving firs, whose dark foliage is finely contrasted with the light
   and more varied tints spread over the scene below.
        Mills.-Within the last thirty years, 31 thrashing-mills have
   been erected in the parish, seven of which are driven by horses, and
   24 by water. There are also six meal-mills, one malt-mill, and one
   lint-mill; but none of these last have been recently erected. The
   whole of the mills now mentioned are built of clay-slate, the pre-
   vailing rock within the parish. There is still one remnant of thir-
   lage in the parish.
