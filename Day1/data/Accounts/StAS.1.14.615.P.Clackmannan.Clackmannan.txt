and salmon are sometimes caught in it, which come up
from the river Forth, in time of spawning:  a practice,
however, very destructive to the fishery.
   There is another river called Black Devon, which takes
its rise in the Saline Hills; and, running W. through the 
middle of this parish, falls into the Forth at Clackmannan
pow.  In its course, it supplies with water two corn mills
and a lint mill.  Two water lades, or aqueducts, are also
taken off from it; one of which drives an engine on the 
Clackmannan coal, and the other supplies a great reser-
voir whcih drives the engine on the Alloa coal.  This re-
servoir goes by the name of Gartmorn Dam; but it is in
fact a small beautiful lake, of 130 acres in extent, having
a little island in the middle of it, and abound with perch,
some pike, and various kinds of trout. Part of it is in
the parish of Alloa; but by far the greatest part is in the
parish of Clackmannan.  There is another small lake in
the parish, called Tullygarth Dam, consisting of 45 acres
in extent, where a few fish are sometimes to be found.
In time of great drought also, the river Black Devon, at
one place, forms the appearance of a small lake, by hav-
ing its water collected together, for the supply of the mills
and coal machinery.
