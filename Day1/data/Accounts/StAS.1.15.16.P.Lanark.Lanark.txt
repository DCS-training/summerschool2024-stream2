planted in great quantities, being reckoned a more bene-
ficial crop than pease.  They are generally planted, a-
bout 4 bolls to an acre, with a dibber; and are three or
four times hand-hoed during the summer.  Each acre pro-
duces from 60 to 100 bolls Linlithgow barley measure,
without dung, which is here seldom or never applied to
the potatoe crop, as they are found to be much drier, and
supposed more wholesome without it.  Many people
however have observed that the repeated culture of po-
tatoes is injurious to the soil: and that the burrow lands
do not now bear such quantities of good oats and barley
as formerly.

adopted here, and since that happy period, clover and rye-
grass have been introduced in considerable quantities,
and the inhabitants now find it more for their advantage to
teather their cows upon their grass fields than to send them

the farmer with what little money was needed.
   Since that period, the victual rents have been abolished,
and a spirit of industry and improvement has diffused it-
