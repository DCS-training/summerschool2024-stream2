     Statistical Account

In January 1791, there were in the parish of Nielston

<TABLE>

      480 families, containing
     1187 males     In all 2330 souls
     1143 females
      908 below 15 years of age
     1372 from 15-70 years
       50 above 70.  Some of these above 90 years
      144 servants employed in husbandry, household-work,
             etc.
       69 Seceders*
        1 Episcopal
        1 Roman Catholic, a woman, wedded by one of our
             young men when in Ireland.

   It appears from the roll of the poll tax taken up by authori-
ty, some copies of which are still preserved in this shire, that
in the year 1695, there were 263 families, so that there is
now an increase of 217 families; and in that return made to
Dr. Webster, about 40 years ago, the number of souls in
Nielston, was 1274, so that now there is an increase of 1056
souls.  Of the above 2330 souls, 439 live in the village of Bar-
head, and its neighbourhood, at the east end of the parish;
472 live in the village of Nielston; and 141 live at Uplamoor,
a village in the west end of the parish.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Of these 69 Seceders, a great number are infants, or chil-
dren.  And as Secession has not been very fashionable of late, ex-
cept in cases of violent settlements, or where the parishioners have
not room in the parish church, it is uncertain what mode of wor-
ship many of these young people may yet adopt.
