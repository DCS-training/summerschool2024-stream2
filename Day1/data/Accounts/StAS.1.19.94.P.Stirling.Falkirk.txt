condition.  The works are under the immediate direction
of Mr Joseph Stainton, who is also a partner.
   They are supplied with iron-ore from Lancashire and
Cumberland; and with ironstone from Banton, Denny,
and Bonnyhill, etc. in this vicinity, and from the county
of Fife, etc.  They have limestone from Burntisland, etc.
and coals from Kinnaird, Carron-hall, and Shieldhill.  All
the materials, which are made use of at these works are
brought to them by water-carriage, except coals, and these
are found in their neighbourhood.  At an average they
use 800 tons of coal, 400 tons of iron stone and ore, and 100
tons of limestone per week.  The ironstone is first calcined
in an open fire; but the iron-ore needs no preparation in
order to be fit for the blast furnace.
   There are five furnaces of this description, which are
supplied with strong currents of air from cast iron cylinders,
instead of bellows.  These cylinders are constructed some-
what like forcing pumps, and are not only more durable
than bellows, but have more power, and produce a better
effect.  They have three cupolas, which receive a proper
supply of air by means of pipes connected with the forcing
cylinders.  There are also fifteen furnaces, which are kept
in action by the external air, without the aid of any arti-
ficial blast.
   At Carton all kinds of cast iron goods are made in the
best manner.  A short kind of cannon called Carsonades
were invented there; and, in certain situations, they are
considered as of great importance.  They are moved in
grooves; and thus the increased friction more effectually
opposes the force of the recoil.  The caliber of the cannon is
bored out of the solid metal, and thus the hole is more
smooth and just in its direction, than when cast with a core,
and the piece is less ready to burst in time of action.  The
