collections, and the interest of some lent money, amounting in
all to about 40 L. yearly.  These matters are managed, both before
and since the assessment was given up, by the kirk-session.  The
charity of the inhabitants, in general, and of those in the vil-
lage of Callander, in particular, is eminent.  The heritors
did, some years ago, adopt a plan for supporting their own
poor, by an equal assessment on the landlord and tenants, ac-
cording to the valuation; but the people could not be restrain-
ed from serving beggars, and some were refractory in paying
their proportion of the assessment; so that the plan was dropt.

   Proprietors and Rents.-The number of heritors is 9.  Three
of them are resident.  The valued rent is 3,278 L. 10 s. Scotch;
the real rent is 3000 L. Sterling, at least.  The rent paid for
one acre, or for a few acres, especially in the vicinity of the
villages of Callander and Kilmahog, is 20 s. at an average.
But in large farms, and on old leases, some arable land is rent-
ed under 5 s. the acre, after allowing a proper deduction for
the pasture or hill ground.  The extent of the farms is from
12 L. 100 L. to per annum.

   Markets.-The greatest fair is held on the 21st of March,
or the 10th old style, which is called Fil-ma-chessaig, or the
Festival of St. Kessaig.  There is another great fair on the 16th
of May, for black cattle, where the drovers find excellent ac-
commodation for themselves and their cows, and are relieved
by Mr. Drummond of Perth, from imposts and several incon-
veniences, which are met with in other places, besides various
marks of attention which he directs his friends to pay to
them.  There are 3 smaller fairs for country business.

   Horses.-The horses are generally of a middle size, between
the Highland poneys, and the heavy draught horses of the
Low Country.  Their number is 350.  They are sure-footed,
full of spirit, and can endure incredible fatigue.
