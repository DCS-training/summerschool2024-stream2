and abundant.  Of all improvements in husbandry there
hundred years, sown grass may be ranked among the most
valuable.
   While it is generally acknowledged that plants rob the
soil, it is at the same time admitted, that they rob it in
different degrees, some more, and some less, according to
their nature, and manner of receiving food.  These evident
truths at once suggest the idea of change; as the farmer
perceives it of importance to arrange his succession of crops
as may be least hurtful to the soil, and, at the same time,
most profitable on the whole.  Hence, the practice of rota-
tion of crops.
   The advantages of this discovery are manifold:  Having
a variety of crops, the farmer divides the labour of the
year.  He is in no risk of the field not agreeing with the
crop.  And he can supply the market annually with all
kinds of provisions.
   An account of the various rotations observed in this pa-
rish will be given among the general tables.
   9. Size of Farms.-The farms in the parish are of vari-
ous sizes, as will be seen in the general tables.  Formerly
this parish abounded with cottaries; but these are now quite
abolished, except a very few; and, of late, the farms have
been considerably enlarged in many places, owing, partly,
to the increasing independence of the farmer from his once
miserable condition as a military bondman; but the chief
cause is the introduction of the arts, whereby bodily labour
has been so wonderfully saved.  The farmer, in ancient
times, seldom reared any crop but oats, a little barley, and
peas.  With these he sowed his infield constantly, and his
outfield occasionally, when not in grass.  Hence, a small
farm rendered him hurried in time of seed and harvest, and
the manufacturing it occupied his whole labour during win-
ter.  In summer he was literally idle! In these enlighten-
