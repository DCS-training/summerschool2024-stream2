   Antiquities, etc.-On the N. side of the hill of Geddes are
to be seen the vestiges of an old edifice, about 26 yards long, 
and nearly half as broad.  It is called Caisteil Fionlab, i. e. 
Finlay's Castle.  It has been built with run, or burnt lime, 
and surrounded at some yeards distance with a ditch.  The 
ditch is drawn round the middle of the detached hill, or rising
ground on which the house was built, and is still very visible. 
At the bottom of this little hill, on the S. E. there appears to 
have been a sunk, or draw-well for the use of the castle.  Even 
tradition does not say by whom, or for what purpose this e-
disice was erected.  A little to the E. on the side of the same 
hill of Geddes, are the remains of the Castle of Rait, built 
probably by Rait of that ilk, but at what period is uncertain. 
It was, for some time, the residence of one of the Cummines; 
and considering the time at which it seems to have been built,
it appears to have been a house of great strength.  A little 
below this castle, is a place called Knock-na-gillan, i. e. the 
hill where the young men or lads were killed.  Here, it is 
said that 18 of the Mackintoshes were destroyed by the Cum-
mines, who them lived at Rait, on account of some grudge
that subsisted between the families.  At the place of Easter 
Geddes, are the remains of an chapel, with a burying 
ground around it.  In this chapel is the burying place of the
family of Kilravock; and here they have been interred for 
many generations back, perhaps ever since the Roses came to 
this part of Scotland.  How long the Roses were in possession 
of the lands of Geddes, previous to the marriage of the Laird 
of Geddes with Mary de Bosco, lady and heiress of Kilravock, 
cannot now, with certainty, be ascertained, as the writs of the 
family relative to that estate were destroyed in the cathedral
