     of Foulis Wester.

name in Scotland is said to have come from France in the
reign of Malcolm Canmore; and branches of that family be-
came proprietors of extensive baronies in different counties
of Scotland, which from them still retain the name of Foulis.
The word seems to be derived from the French feuilles, that
is, leaves; to which the three bay leaves, worn by persons of
the name of Foulis on their arms, apparently allude.  The
names of most places in this part of the country being evi-
dently of Gaelic derivations, some have imagined Foulis to
be derived from the two Gaelic word fou lios, that is, below
the orchard.  There is not, however, the smallest vestige of
an orchard near the village, much less in the grounds above
it; and had the name been formed from the words now
mentioned, it would probably have been accented on the last
syllable, whereas the letter i is no more heard in the com-
mon pronunciation, than the final e in the feuilles.
   This parish lies in the north side of Strathearn, having that
of Crieff on the W.; Monzie N. W.; Little Dunkeld N.;
Moneidie N. E.; Methven E.; and on the S. Maderty,
from which it is separated by the Pow, excepting about 40
acres of Maderty, which are on the north side of that river.
Foulis is eight miles long, and six broad.  The great road
from Perth to Crieff, an extent of 18 miles, enters it on the
east side, ten miles from the former of these towns, and
leaves its western extremity within two miles of the latter.

   Face of the Country.-The soil in general is a red clay or
till, which on some of the best cultivated farms, becomes
blackish and loamy, by plenty of good manure.  The soil is
considerably deeper in the south than in the north side of the
parish.  An high ridge running from East to West along the
top of what is called the braes of Foulis, divides it nearly in-
to two equal parts.  The lands on the south side of that
