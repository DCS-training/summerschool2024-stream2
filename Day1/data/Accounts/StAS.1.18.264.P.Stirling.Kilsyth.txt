     Statistical Account

   In most places, there are more children to a family in the
country than in the towns.  But upon an examination of the
2 d table, it will appear that the reverse is the fact with us: this
is undoubtedly rather singular, but it may perhaps be easily ac-
counted for.  The manufacturing class of people, generally
marry younger than farmers and labourers; because they are
much sooner upon an independent footing.  A weaver, the
moment his apprenticeship is over, can earn a decent liveli-
hood, and after serving as a journeyman for a short time, ge-
nerally marries or begins house-keeping.  Whereas a servant,
or even the son of a respectable farmer, unless he turns to
some other profession, is not so soon independent: the son,
if his father is alive, is dependent on him, and in some mea-
sure his servant; and the servant as he changes his master
and his residence often, cannot so conveniently marry.  As
this is the case, and as the farmers and labourers are the most
numerous class in the country, as the manufacturers are in
the town, it is natural to suppose, that the latter should marry
sooner, and of course, should sooner become the fathers of
families.
   I shall not presume to say positively, whither the population
of this parish has been on the increase or decrease: it seems
to have been always on the increase.  If Dr Webster's account
be accurate, the increase is very considerable indeed, since
the period in which he enumerated them.  At that time,
there were only according to his account 1346; so that in the
course of 40 years, there are no less than 1104 souls added to
this parish.
   The chief causes of this increase are doubtless the follow-
ing: 1st, That manufactures have been, especially since that
period, in a flourishing condition: 2 d, That of course, many
from the remote highlands, and some from almost every quar-
