stone dykes, or hedge and ditch.  Probably sufficient atten-
tion is not paid to this last kind of fence; the young thorns
should be more cherished and better defended, in order to
secure good fences.  One property in the northern district is
almost completely inclosed and subdivided, and lets, from
year to year, considerably higher for pasture than it would
do upon an ordinary lease for tillage.  About 4 years ago,
above a fourth part of the parish was sold at 36 years pur-
chase, and is likely to turn out a good bargain.  The rent of
land continues to rise in this parish.

   Agriculture, Produce, etc.-The ploughs are of the Scotch

been a very considerable alteration in the mode of plowing.
In general the plough is now drawn by two horses, and driven
by the man who holds it.  In breaking up old ley, or in
giving the first plowing to stiff ground, 3 horses are some-
times yoked; and, in one or two corners, the plough is drawn
by 4 horses yoked a-breast, and driven by a man who holds
the horses by the halters, and walks backwards.  In general
the farmers in the northern district are very industrious; but
they are only emerging out of the old method of culture.
The distinction of out-field and in field still takes place in some
degree.  Turnips and sown grass are only beginning to find
their way into this district.  The want of inclosures, and
winter herding, are great obstacles to their progress, particu-

in summer is consumed in procuring fuel; they are far from
manure; the ground lies open, is full of baulks and large
stones, and in some places it is very wet and spouty.  This
last circumstance, with the coldness of the climate, many
plead as an apology, for not having more of their farms in
