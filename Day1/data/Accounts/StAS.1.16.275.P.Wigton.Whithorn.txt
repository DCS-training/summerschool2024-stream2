Candida Casa, Leucopibia or Leucophibia, Whithern,
or Whitherne.  It is now called whithorn.

<FOOTNOTE>

*In the Statistical Account of Sorbie, vol. i. p. 245 there is a mis-
take, which I beg leave to correct.  It is there said, "The oak, ash,
"beech, alder, fir," etc. in that parish," are equal to any in their qua-
"lity."  This is right; the mistake follows: "Lord Galloway has
"found, that pruning makes them grow with great vigour.  By espe-
"riment it appears, that plants which Were pruned, advanced at the rate
"of four years in six, before these which were not pruned."  
Upon the above passage, I observe:
   1.  That I never knew the Earl of Galloway order trees to be pruned,
unless where their branches became troublesome upon roads.
