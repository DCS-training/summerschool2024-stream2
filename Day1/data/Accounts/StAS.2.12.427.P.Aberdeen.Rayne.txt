   One old woman has been insane for five years, and an old man
has been blind above twenty years; but there are none deaf and
dumb.  Within the last fifteen years, a man died aged 97 years,
and his wife aged 95: a husband and wife, with his sister, lived
in one house, until their united ages amounted to 250 years, each
of them being above 83: and the like instance of longevity was
witnessed in another house.
   Only two of the heritors are resident within the bounds both gen-
tlemen of good family and fortune; and the others have property.
and domiciles in different parishes.

   The valued rent of the whole lands is L.2544 Scots.  The real
rent, consisting partly of grain, commuted at the county fiars is
variable; but that of the best ground or old infield may average
per imperial acre L.2 Sterling; and that for outfield, varying ac-
cording to the quality, from 12s. to L.1, 4s. per imperial acre;
and the latter, comprising about four-fifths of the land in tillage,
while the former is only one-fifth, reduces the average rent to
something less than L. 1 Sterling per arable acre; and makes
the gross rental of the whole, L. 5650.  There are,no grass fields
