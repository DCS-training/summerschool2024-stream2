   It is difficult to determine, at what period the town was
built.  The ower part, which was certainly the oldest, no
longer remains.  One house still standing, has date 1533, cut
over the gateway; and parts of some others are said to be still
older.  A writing among the town records, which bears to
have been presented to the Court of Session, in 1580, sets
forth, that the " town was erected into a free burgh of baro-
" ny by the king's most noble progenitors, in the year
" 1456."  In 1548, Mary, Queen of Scotland, created it a
free royal burgh.  But the rights and privileges thus acquired
from the Crown, were, after the Restoration, resigned into
the hands of William and Ann, Duke and Duchess of Ha-
milton; who, in 1670, restored to the community its former
possessions, and erected it into a "burgh of regality," depen-
dent on them and their successors:  and thus it has continued,
after some ineffectual struggles, to this time.

   Air, Diseases, Etc.-The air is generally reputed tolerably
dry and healthful - Fogs are not frequent, and rains less so
than at other places a few miles distant; insomuch that it is a

other parts of the country.  This is one cause of the lateness
of the harvests.  After the summer solstice, the rains are
commonly mored copious; and during open weather in the
winter season, a great deal often falls.
