to the plough.  From the number of work oxen, it might be
supposed, that there would be more oxen ploughs: But
many of the farmers keep 12 oxen to one plough, yoking one
half in the forenoon, and the other half in the afternoon.  By
these means, they have time to feed, and the men who manage
them are kept in constant work.  If we suppose every plough-
gate, to spare from its produce 100 bolls for sale, (and the
computation is very moderate), it will amount to 6,000 bolls
yearly, partly wheat, partly barley, partly oat-meal, and
partly beans and pease, after paying the rent, lowing the land,
and every other expence that attends agriculture.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 11 heritors in the parish*,
and 27 considerable farmers, besides many more of smaller note.
The valued rent is 6,277 L. 2 s. 4 d. Scotch; the real rent, includ-
ing 850 L. for salmon fishing, and 10 L. for kelp, is 3778 L. Sterling.
This state of the real rent may not be perfectly accurate, be-
cause 3 of the proprietors have the greater part of their estates
in their own hands; but it is supposed to be near the truth.
If the progress of agriculture, for 20 years to come, shall bear
any proportion to what it has been for the same number of
years past, it is more than probable, that the real rents of the
parish will be as many pounds Sterling, as the valued rents
are now pounds Scotch.
