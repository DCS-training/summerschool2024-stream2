very short time, have not only what was sufficient for their
own wear, but many thousand yards of woollen stuffs, as has
been said was the case formerly, for exportation.
   A brewery might also be erected here, in order to furnish
beer of various kinds for the inhabitants, and the shipping
that occasionally comes among them.  They might have a
distillery, with a view to supersede the necessity of bringing
British spirits from the south.  Hides, which makes such a
considerable article in the exports, might be tanned here;
and as there are kelp and tallow, and butter and oil, which
are said to be the chief ingredients in soap, they might also
have a soap manufactory.  But neither these, nor any other
kind of manufacture that requires fire will ever thrive here,
or indeed any where in the north, until the duty on coals
carried north of the Red-head be no longer ranked among
the number of our taxes.  This tax has undoubtedly dis-
graced the book of rates, from which it ought in instantly to
be cancelled, and committed to oblivion; and the member
who would introduce a bill into the House of Commons, and
carry it into a law for that effect, would deserve well of his
country.  In almost every point of view, it is both unjust
and impolitic; for it has an evident tendency to hurt trade,

from coal to a duty, from which they that reside near the
coal pit are exempted; and when it is collected with the ut-
most care, it makes but a very inconsiderable addition to
the revenue.
   The advantages which the inhabitants of this country
might draw from manufactures are, except kelp, perhaps not
superior to what might be obtained from fisheries.  For this
species of industry, the people here are admirably well situa-
ted.  Lobsters of an excellent kind, and in very considerable
numbers, have, for many years past, been caught here; and
