churches are, in general, exceedingly cold and dirty, and
there is little hope of this evil being soon remedied.  The
patronage belongs to the family of Gordonston.  The
Stipend is 72 bolls of barley and oats, and L. 50 Sterling of
money, with L. 2, 10 s. for communion-elements.  The
manse and offices are new; the glebe and gardens contain
about 5 Scotch acres.  The old church of Ogstown is now
converted into a burying place for the family of Gordon-
ston, and was rebuilt some time ago with great taste, in
the ancient Gothic style.  The vestiges of the old church
are to be seen in the church-yard at Kinneddar, and adjoin-
ing to these the remains of an old palace or castle belonging to
the Bishop of Moray, where he resided before the castle of
Spynie was built.-The parochial funds are very inconsi-
derable, the whole income not exceeding L. 20 Sterling;
and this sum, out of which the salary of the session-clerk,
beadle, and other prochial charges, must be paid, is all
the provision for 49 or 50 poor.-At the parish-school,
about 30 or 40 children are instructed in Latin, English,
writing and arithmetic.  The salary of the schoolmaster is
12 bolls barley, desides the emoluments arising from the
office of session-clerk, which is commonly conjoined with
that of schoolmaster, and amounts to L. 3 Sterling, exclusive
of a few tristing perquisites.

souls.  At the beginning of the year 1791, there were
