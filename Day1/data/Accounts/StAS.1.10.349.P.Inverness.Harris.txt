island in the entrance to East Loch Tarbert.  Its land dimen-
sions are not easily ascertained, its parts being scarcely cohe-
rent, through a singular intervention of water lakes and arms
of the sea jutting in through it in various directions.  Its two
extreme points from E. to W. may be computed 3 miles dis-
tant.  On the E. point is a light-house built in 1788; and near
the western extremity are two of the best natural harbours in
the Hebrides: Mariners call it Isle of Glass.  Scarp is a high
round rocky island, one compact mountain, of which the
diameter at the base may be 3 miles.  It is situated at the
mouth of Loch Resort, and divided from Huskinish, already
mentioned, by a sound somewhat less than a mile broad at
high water.
   Of the uninhabited islands, belonging to this division, seve-
ral small ones are placed round the bays and harbours of
Scalpay, and along all the creeks of the E. coast of Harris.
There is one in East Loch Tarbert, called Skeotifvay, about
a mile long.  In the W. loch is a long flat one called Isay;
farther W. along the forest shore are two called Soay.  With-
in Scarp, at the mouth of Loch Resort, is a flat one called
Fladday.  All these names appear to be Danish.  Four leagues
N. W. from Taransay is a large green island called G'aaskeir-
which is a Gaelic name, signifying the rock of geese.  It is
frequented by vast stocks of wild geese.  The gentleman
who possesses it in tack, used for many years to send to it,
from the island of Taransay, 12 heifers and a bull about the
12th of August; and they were brought back in high order
early in June, each cow having a calf.  One year the whole
stock perished; and, to whatever cause the change may be
imputed, it is certain the pasture is now so far degenerated,
that it affords but scanty feeding to about 12 sheep of a very
small size.
