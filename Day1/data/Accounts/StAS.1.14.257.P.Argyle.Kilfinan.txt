   Borra or borradh, is also a file of stones, but differs
from a cairn in many respects, viz. in external figure,
being always oblong in internal construction, and in its
size and design.  There are 2 vestiges of them in this
parish, which, although they are mostly now dilapidated
for building of houses and walls, yet so much remain of
each, as to show distinctly what they once were.  The one
of them, which is largest, is about 1 1/2 mile N. from
the parish church, a little above the great line of road,
on the top of an eminence, near a moss.  This immense
pile of stones was, till last summer, near 40 yards long,
of considerable breadth, and amazing depth.  the
bottom, from the one end to the other, there was a
number of small apartments or cells, end to end, each
made up of 5 or 7 large flags.  Each cells was about 6
feet long, 4 broad; and such of them as remained to be
seen in our time, about 5 feet high.  One large flag
made up each side; and another, which was generally
of a curved figure, to throw off the water, covered it for
a roof:  the end sometimes was made up of 2, and an
open between them wide enough for a man to squeeze
himself through:  sometimes there was only 1 flag in the
end, and only half as high as the side flags, so that the
entry was over it; and in these there were only 5 flags.
They were generally built on an eminence, where the
fall of the water was from thence on either side; and
when that was not the cafe, the cells were at some dis-
tance from the bottom of the pile or borradh.  The
cells were not always in a straight line from end to end,
but they were always so regular, as that the same com-
munication pervadded the whole*.

*There are various conjectures about their use and design.  Some
think they were burying places for the ashes of heroes and great war-
