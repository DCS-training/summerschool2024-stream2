	tion of the salary of L.16 per annum; and Mr David Watson,
	elected in August 1836, who is the acting parochial teacher.
	   There is one additional school required in the heights of the
	parish.
	   Savings Bank.-There is one connected with this parish, which
	was established in Tain, January 1840. The minister of the parish
	is one of the directors.
	   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
	receiving parochial aid may be estimated at 60; and the ave-
	rage sum allotted to each is 7s. 6d. per week. The annual amount
	of contributions for their relief is about L.26; of Which sum L.7
	per annum is contributed by Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, L.3
	by the Duke of Sutherland, L.2 by Mr Macleod of Cadboll, and
	the remaining sum of L.14 (which is the average for the last four
	years) arises from church collections.
	   There is generally a disposition among the poor to refrain from
	seeking parochial aid, as degrading; but the feeling is decreasing,
	from pecuniary distress and want of employment.
	   Inn, &c.-There is no fair or market of any kind held in this pa-
	rish; and there is only one small inn, or rather alehouse, which is
	situated on Struy road from Bonar Bridge to Stittenham.
	   Fuel.-The fuel used by the lower orders is peats, and turf,
	which can be easily procured in the moors, and costs only the
	trouble of cutting, seasoning, and carrying home. Coals are burnt
	by the higher classes, and are sold by the Newcastle vessels, which
	come to the bay of Ardmore, at 16s. 6d. per ton.

	November 1840.
