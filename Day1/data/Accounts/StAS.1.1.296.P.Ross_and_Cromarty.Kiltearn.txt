the face of the rock; all which is very gratifying to any one
who takes a forenoon's ride for pleasure.  But, as the fine
plantations contribute so much to the beauty of this parish,
we cannot avoid taking notice of it as a remarkable event,
greatly to be regretted, that, upon the 17th day of January
1791, the high wind broke down, and tore up by the roots,
about 6000 fine firs in the different plantations upon the estate
of Fowlis.  We must not omit to take notice of a place call-
ed Corrivackie, which is so situated behind the great hill of
Uaifh, that the sun does not shine there from November to
the beginning of March.

   Church.-It has never been ascertained beyond a doubt
who is patron of this parish.  The only claimants are, the
Crown, and the family of Fowlis.  All the ministers from
the Revoltion, down to 1770, were settled by a call from
the heritors.  The present incumbent, and his predecessor,
were settled by royal presentations.  Mr Harry Robertson
was translated from Clyne to Kiltearn the 9th May 1776.  He
has been married since 1772, and has 8 children now living,
4 sons and 4 daughters.  The church of this parish was
handsomely rebuilt in 1790, at the expence of L. 700 Ster-
ling.  The manse and offices were built in 1762, at a very
moderate expence.  They require some repairs; and there is
no doubt that they will soon be made comfortable.  The sti-
pend consists of 136 bolls, half oat-meal, and half barley, and
L. 32 Sterling, with a glebe of 4 acres arable ground, with-
out any grass.

   Eminent Men.-Though every age, and every soil, does
not produce men of eminent talents, it cannot be denied that
Kiltearn has given birth to several who have done honour to
their native country.  The Munros have distinguished them-
