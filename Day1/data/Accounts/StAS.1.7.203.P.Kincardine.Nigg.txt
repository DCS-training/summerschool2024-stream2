   Causeway Stones.-Oblong roundish pebbles, from 6 to 12
inches in length, are brought by sea and land carriage from
the sea-shore, and are exported to different places in England
for ordinary causeways.  The collecting and carriage of a
ton may be 1 s. 8 d.; and the quantity exported annually
400 tons.
   In 1766, the granite quarries by the sea and in the hills
were opened for making causeway stones to pave some streets
in London.  This granite is of a remarkably close texture,
and of great hardness.  To this new work 600 men were
collected from different places.  It led many families to set-
tle for a time in the parish, and employed some horses in
drawing the stones, where water conveyance could not be
obtained.  Decreasing rapidly from 1772, it now engages
only 17 inhabitants, with a few strangers.  The shape of the
formed stone is something wedge-like, 12 inches long in the
head, 6 broad, and 9 deep, being 2 inches lessened in length.
and in breadth on the base:  The smaller in similar propor-
tions.  The ton may be made by a man in two days, costs
2 s. 6 d. besides the expence of powder and tools; and will
pave, according to the size of the stones, from 2 3/4 to 5 square
yards. 3000 Tons are now annually exported to London,
Maidstone, Ramsgate, and other places.  The cubic foot
weighs 151 pounds.  This new and heavy employment re-
quired and introduced a better breed of horses.  The wages
were at first too high; so that a man gained 18 s. and 20 s.
in a week, which did him no good.  Except by a few indi-
viduals, all was spent.

   Fisheries and Salmon Fishers.-The salmon fishers, 23 in
number, almost all of whom have pieces of ground, are en-
gaged in fishing the river and the sea adjacent, and are em-
ployed at vacant hours diligently in cultivating the land.
