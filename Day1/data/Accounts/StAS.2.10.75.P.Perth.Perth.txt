     This not having produced the intended effect, the session re-
  newed their prohibition in the following minute:--"2d September
  1589 : Whilk day, bailies, council, and deacons of crafts, minister,
  and elders of the burgh of Perth, convened within the revestry,
  understanding that there was an act and ordinance made upon
  the tenth day of January, in the year of God, one thousand five
  hundred and eighty-ehght years, by the bailies, council, deacons
  of crafts, ministers and elders of the said burgh, bearing the tenor

  date of the said act, certain persons have been buried within the
  said kirk, wherewith they have dispensed, they now of one

  of council, and in the books of the Assembly of Perth.
     "To the making of whilk repentance James Davidson, deacon
  of the hammermen, and George Robertson, one of the council,
  and deacon of the skinners, disrented."
     As this prohibitory act of session was not absolute, but admit-
  ted of exception, to be judged of by the members chapterly con-
  vened, persons of influence and affluence continued to obtain kirk
  burial.  Accordingly, in the record we have such minutes as
