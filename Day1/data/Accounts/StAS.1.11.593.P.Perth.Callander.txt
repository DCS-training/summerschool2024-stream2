lands in Scotland.  But where the people were most crowded and the landlord
had least money, there depopulation has made the widest strides ; and the hu-
man race has been swept away as with a pestilence.  In the south of Scotland
there are many towns, to which the people could resort; but in the West
Highlands, there are few towns of any consequence.  The people, therefore,
in that large tract of country, from Kintyre to Ross, who are dispossessed of
their farms, have no alternative, but to cross the Atlantic, if they have spirit
or wealth; or to travel southward, till they pass the Grampians, if they be
poor.  The villages of this place, and other villages in similar situations, are
filled with those naked and starving crowds of people, who are pouring down
every term, for shelter and for bread.  And what is to be the fate of villages,
crowded by strangers, who have neither money, nor arts; nor industry, I leave
to others, who have more political  soresight, to determine.
   One thing is certain, On this point, that the proprietors, who erect villages
on a proper plan, in order to keep their countrymen in the kingdom, deserve
better of the public, than those who set them adrift, without the least feeling of
remorse:  Yet the conduct of these humane gentlemen ought to be regulated by
a cautious prudence, even in gratifying their feelings of compassion.  And a
hint may be taken by the wise, from whatever quarter it comes, especially when
it is given with sincerity, and has a tendency to do good.
   Whenever the population of any town or village exceeds the industry of the
inhabitants, from that moment the place must decline.  When their consump-
tion is greater than their earnings, when their wants are not supplied by their
labour, the stock of the society must decrease, and many undue practices must
be substituted for the honest means of procuring subsistence.  The body politic
may be vitiated, as well as the natural body.  If its corpulence is too much in-
creased, bad humours prey upon the constitution, for want of exercise; habits
