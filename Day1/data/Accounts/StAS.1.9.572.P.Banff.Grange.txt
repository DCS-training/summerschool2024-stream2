haps little or no crop, and whose labour cannot maintain a
numerous family of young children, who therefore must
be supplied from the poors funds, is obliged to work on the
roads six days in the year, while a farmer who pays L. 40
or L. 50 rent, works 4 carts, and needs only one servant
and himself, except boys for herding, is liable only for
twice as much as the poor labourer; and servants are en-
tirely exempted from this heavy tax, though they are much
better able to bear it than many householders*.

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor.-This parish, in times of
Popery, belonged to the parish of Keith, and was erected
into a separate parish in the year 1618, (Presbytery re-
cords).  The present church was originally a chapel of
ease, built by the abbot, and dedicated to the Virgin Ma-
ry; it is now in a ruinous condition, and never was fit
to contain the congregation.  The manse, which was built
about 40 years ago, was repaired in 1778 and in 1787,
and is still a bad house.  The offices are tolerably good,

   *The statute labour ought therefore to be converted into money
by act of Parliament, and exacted in different proportions, according
to the circumstances of the persons; for instance, a poor householder,
that has little or no crop, ought not to be assessed above 1 s a year; a ser-
vant that has no family ought to be affected 1 s. 6 d; tenants ought to
pay according to their rent, or the number and kind of carts they em-
ploy; and heritors (who are at present entirely exempted, and whose rent
rises in proportion to the easy communication by good roads) ought to
be taxed in proportion to their rent: Is such a scheme was adopted, and
the roads contracted for, they would soon be made, so as to save 50 per
cent of the expense of transporting commodities, and also of the tear and
wear of carriages and harness  And after the roads were once effectually
made or repaired, the tax could be reduced considerably, and yet the
roads be kept in excellent repair.  The act ought also to contain a clause,
appointing a committee, of equal numbers of the most respectable tenants,
as well as landholders, in each district, to carry the act into execution,
that there might be no improper exemption.
