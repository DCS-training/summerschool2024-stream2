blackish colour; and it is from this circumstance it de-
rives its name.  It abounds in excellent trout.  In sum-
mer, and even in winter, it is commonly but a small
stream; but being fed by a number of rills and small tor-
rents, which issue from the neighbouring hills, it swells
sometimes unexpectedly to a great size, and overflows, to

it passes.

   Rent, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is 6836 L.
3 s. 11 6/12 d. Scots.  The real rent about 3550 L.  Sterling.
The rent of land varies according to its quality and situ-

small portions, the rent is from 1 L. to 1 L. 10 s. an acre*;
enclosed arable farms from 10 s. to 20 s. 6 d. an acre: un-

stocked with sheep, are not let by the acre, but in the
lump.  The farms are, in general, from 70 L. to 350 L. a-
year; but there are some from 70 L. down to 50 L.; and a
few small possessions below 20 L.  It ought to be observed
also, that several farmers, some of whom reside in the 
parish, and some out of it, but all having farms in it, pos-
sess lands to the value of 500 L., and even 700 L. a-year.
About 50 years ago, the real rent of the parish did not

of the best lands were, about that time, let at 5 s. the
acre.
   This great rise of rent is not owing to any considerable
rise in the price of grain:  For even so far back as to-
wards the end of the last century, grain fold, communibus
annis+, nearly as high as it is now.  But the causes,
