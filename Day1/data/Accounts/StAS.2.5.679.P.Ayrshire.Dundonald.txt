ward appearance was a matter of consideration. The house at
Auchans, which bears date of 1644, is of a very irregular and gro-
tesque appearance. As a mansion-house, it is now in a state of
hopeless disrepair, and is occupied only in compartments by cot-
tars: this, in point of taste, is much to be regretted, as a finer
situation for a handsome building and residence is scarcely any
where to be found. From the orchard adjoining this mansion, went
forth the fruit which has long been known over Scotland as the
Auchans' Pear. The tree originally came from France, and was
blown down, in a good old age, by a storm about sixty years ago.

	Of the increase which, in this respect, has taken place over the
country generally, this parish has had its full share, as will be seen
from the following returns:--

                  in 1755, the population was   983
                     1791,                     1317
                     1801,                     1240
                     1811,                     1610
                     1821,                     2482
                     1831,                     5579

And, from the Government returns of the present year, it is 6691, and is divided as
follows:--
                    Town of Fullarton,         2813
                     Do. of Troon,             1409
                    Villige of Dundonald,       345
                    (Do) of Old Rome,           256
                      Do. of Shewalton,         219
                     Do. of Loans,              205
                   Country, including humlets, 1444
	This increase is to be ascribed to general causes; but particu-
larly of late years to the erection of the harbour at Troon, and the
consequent increase of its trade; and also to its becoming a fa-
vourite place of resort for sea-bathing quarters.
	The condition of the people generally, but more especially in
the landward districts, is comparatively everything that could be
desired. In the town of Fullarton, where hand-loom weaving is
the principal occupation, and at the two collieries, from the prover-
bial thoughtlessness of this class of labourers, much destitution,
both temporal and spiritual, undoubtedly exists. Still even the
worst in these respects are not more so than their neihbours, and
not so bad as we have witnessed in many other districts. As a
whole, the people are orderly, intelligent, comfortable as to food
and raiment, and contented with their condition, except when some
wiser heads would persuade them to the contrary; "but even that,
they dinna mind it lang."
