Elhardholm, which is a place of that kind, and connected
with, and belonging to this parish, there is one of these cha-
pels, that in every respect resembles the other significant
buildings of the same nature so much, as not to deserve a
particular description.  On the highest ground, and near the
center of the parish, there is, as in most of the other islands,
a wart or ward-hill, which commands an accurate and exten-
sive view, not only of this, but of 15 surrounding parishes.
To me this appears plainly to be artificial, and though one
of the largest kind, is certainly one of those tumuli which
are so frequently to be met with in these islands.  These tu-
muli, or little mounds of earth, seem to have been raised to
cover the dead bodies, and perpetuate the memories of dis-
tinguished persons; for in almost every one of them that has
been opened, there have been found bones, and sometimes
burnt earth, and not unfrequently urns containing half burnt
bones and ashes.  In support of this opinion we may have
recourse to Tacitus and Verstigan, who inform us that both
the ancient Romans, and Germans, and Saxons, observed
the custom of laying their dead bodies on the ground, and
raising over them heaps of earth, covered with turf, in the
form of little hillocks.  To the eastward of this little wart
or ward-hillock about an English mile, is a high stone, called
the Standing Stone of Shapinshay.  Above the level of the
ground it is 12 feet high, and perhaps 5 or 6 below it; its
breadth is between 4 and 5 feet; its thickness a foot and a
half; and from its being clothed in moss or scruf, it has a ve-
ry venerable majestic aspect, and seems to have weathered
many ages.  In both its form and dimensions, it very much
resembles stones that are found standing in many of the other
islands, particularly, the circle and semicircle in the parish of
Stennes; and it has perhaps been erected either as a place
of worship, or sacrifice, or to be a monument of some signal
