     Statistical Account

some of it pretty fine, for sale, and some of a coarser quality
for domestic use.

   Time of Sowing and Reaping.-The oats are commonly
sown in March, or about the beginning of April; imme-
diately after the oats are sown, the potatoes are planted;
after which the barley is sown about the end of April or be-
ginning of May.  The earliest barley is ripe in the end of
August or beginning of September.  The harvest commonly
becomes general in September, and is finished by the end of
that month, or the beginning of October.

   Number of Ploughs, Horses, Cattle, etc.-The exact num-
ber of ploughs in this parish cannot be easily ascertained.
But the error will not be great, if they be stated at an hun-
dred.  The number of horses is not less than 450.  Some of
them are of a pretty large size, and so stout that two of them
draw a plough; but the most of them are very much below
that size.  The number of black cattle is about 1400,
mostly oxen used in the plough, eight of them together.
They are of the light nimble Highland breed; when turning
unfit for work, they are disposed of to dealers in cattle for
the English market.  Few of these cattle are reared in this
place; they are generally brought from the Highlands when
young.  Though there is not much pasture ground in this
parish, yet most of the tenants cottagers have sheep.  The 
number is about 2500.  They are of a very small size, the
carcase will not weigh above two stone Dutch.  The wool is
spun by the women, and manufactured into coarse cloth for
domestic use, and the sheep are disposed of to butchers from
Inverness and Fort-George.
