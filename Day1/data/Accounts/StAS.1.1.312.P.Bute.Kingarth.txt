     Statistical Account

   Schools.-There are at present three schools.  1st, A pa-
rish school, the salary L. 6 Sterling; 2d, a school, endowed
and supported by the society for propagating Christian know-
ledge, salary only L. 6 per annum, a free house, sale-yard,
and a cow, maintained summer and winter by the district.  It
is situated on the north-west side of the parish, where young
children are too far from the parochial school.  The 3 d is in
the north west quarter of the parish; and the teacher is paid
by the inhabitants of that quarter.

   Antiquities.-On the south-west part of the parish, on a
little rocky hill, there are evident vestiges of a vitrified wall,
said to be a Danish sort; but it seems more probable that it
was made by the inhabitants to defend the island from the
attacks of the Danes and Norwegians.  The hill, in the ori-
ginal, signifies, ' The hill of the Lowland men.'  On a
plain piece of ground, at a little distance from the the Mid-
Kirk, there are evident remains of a Druidical temple, three
large stones of which are still standing.  It had been fur-
rounded with wood.  There are large trunks of oaks-trees in
a morass, not above 200 yards from the temple.
