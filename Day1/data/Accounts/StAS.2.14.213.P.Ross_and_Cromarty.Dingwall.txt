The prevailing winds in this parish are the westerly and south-
westerly, which blow during a great part of the year. From this
quarter also we have our itiost boisterous and stormy weather. Our
easterly winds are generally laden with fogs and damps from the
German Ocean, and are frequently accompanied with rain. The
coldest wind is from the north-west.
The climate here is upon the whole pretty good. It is, how-
ever, exceedingly variable, and subject to frequent showers, owing
to the vicinity of Ben Wyvis, about which the clouds congregate,
and which on this account serves the purpose of a natural baroine-
ter, from the position of the clouds with regard to which, changes
can be predicted with tolerable accuracy. From the sheltered si-
tuation of Dingwall, being almost surrounded by hills, it suffers
little from cold, the winters being remarkably mild. But from its
low situation, the nature of the soil, and its vicinity to the sea, it
suffers considerably from damp, more so than the quantity of rain
which falls (as showed by the following table of obsemations for
the last five years) would indicate.

The climate, although variable, is,dbcidedly salubrious. The
parish is occasionally visited, in common with the district around,
by the usual epidemics of the country,-small-pox and measles,
typhus and scarlet fever, &c.; but these occasions are by no means
