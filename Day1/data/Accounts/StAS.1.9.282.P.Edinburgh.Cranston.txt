the windows was the following inscription in the Monkish
style, 'Diversorium infra, Habitaculum supra.'  At Upper
Cranston stands a venerable green holly, perhaps the lar-
gest in the island, with too evident marks of old age and de-
cay.  It measures 7 1/2 feet in circumference, or 2 feet 4.64
inches in diameter, and where it divides into branches,
the trunk is no more than 7 feet high.  At Caickmoor,
there is a thriving beech 16 feet round, or 5 feet 1.11 in-
ches in diameter, and at Preslonhall, another 15 feet round,
or 4 feet 9.29 inches in diameter.  These trees, from
their near situation to the mansion houses, seem to have
been planted at first in the garden ground, to which cir-
cumstance we must in some measure ascribe the great size
they now exhibit.

   Husbandry, etc.-It was in this parish that the first ex-
ample of the drill husbandry was given.  Sir John Dal-
rymple of Cousland, grandfather to the present Baronet,
was the first person who introduced into Scotland the sow-
in of turnip, and the planting of cabbages in the open
field.  He also greatly improved the breed of horses and
black catt1e, and was among the first who sowed clover
and rye grass.  Mr Cockburn of Ormiston, and he, both
of them distinguished by zeal for their country, and a pas-
sion for agriculture, established at Ormiston a society,
which had for its object the improvement of husbandry.
Besides actual farmers, persons of the first rank in the coun-
try, were proud of being inrolled as members of that club.
The Duke of Perth, and John Earl of Stair, regularly at-
tended its monthly meetings.  The soil of this parish con-
sists partly of clay or stiff lands, and partly of those that are
light.  The whole is arable, in general fertile, and well a-
dapted for producing all kinds of grain.  The state of a-
griculture is much the same as in other parishes of Mid-
