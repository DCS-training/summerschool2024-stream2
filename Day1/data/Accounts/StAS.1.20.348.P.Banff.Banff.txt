   Inoculation.-The practice of inoculation for the small-

The too tender conscience of the superstitious interpose, to
rob them of its salutary benefits.  We tempt GOD, say

the dreaded mortification might not heave taken place, and
the patient sacrifices his life to his timid caution.  Yet no
man of common sense will dispute, that the practice of am-
putation is salutary on the whole, and is the means of pre-
serving many valuable lives to the community+.

above one in forty escape having the distemper, during the course of their
lives.  Let it be observed, then in the first place, there are thirty-nine to
