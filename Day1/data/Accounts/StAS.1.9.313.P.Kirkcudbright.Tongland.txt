     of Tongland.

In the north end it is rocky and moorish, interspersed with
rising ground, small hills, moos, and valley land, and spots
of natural meadow ground.  In the west side of the parish,
and upon each side of the water of Tarff, there is a consi-
derable quantity of fine natural meadow ground, which
yields large crops of hay, but in wet seasons is much dama-
ged by floods.  The soil of the parish is good in general,
and consists of a considerable variety.  In the south end of
the parish it consists of a fine red mould, upon a rocky and
tilly bottom, but of a fertile nature, and agrees remarkably
well with gentle rains in summer.  In the middle of the
parish, in some places, it is a mixture of sand upon a peb-
bly bottom, which agrees ill with dry seasons.  In the
north end it consists of mossy soil, upon a stony bottom,
and is naturally barren, and more suited for pasture than
agriculture.  There are, however, a number of arable spots
interspersed, which yield luxuriant crops, when manured
with lime.  The moorish soil, covered with heath and bent-
ish grass, affords good pasture for sheep and black cattle.
The south end, and middle of the parish, in general, is of a
fertile soil, and excellently suited either for the purposes of
agriculture, or breeding and rearing of black cattle and
sheep.  In many parts of the north end, the soil is moorish
and unfruitful, being interspersed with rocky ground.-
The air is pure, dry, and very wholesome.  There are no
stagnating lakes, and little low or marshy ground.  The
rivers produce a constant and free circulation of air.
The inhabitants are healthful, and subject to no local dis-
eases peculiar to the place.  The inoculation of the small-
pox has made rapid progress of late years, among all ranks,
and is attended with its usual success.
