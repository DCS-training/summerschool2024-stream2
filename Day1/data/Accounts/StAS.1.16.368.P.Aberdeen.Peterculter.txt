     Statistical Account

   Church, Manse, Stipend, etc.-In the year 1779, a small
elegant church was built, and completely furnished with
new galleries and seats in an uniform manner.  Three
years prior to this, the manse got a new substantial roof.
Then, and in 1779, it received other alterations and re-
pairs, which made it, though it be but small, a comfortable
habitation.  It is built of stone and clay, and is said to be
more than 100 years old; therefore it cannot long remain

   The proprietor of Culter is patron; but the right of pro-
perty is at present disputed.

   School, etc.-Some years since the schoolmaster's salary

6 s. 8 d.; he also receives L. 1: 14: 2 from a fund left by
two of the late proprietors of Culter, Sir Alexander Cu-

session-clerk, with some other perquisites, which are but
