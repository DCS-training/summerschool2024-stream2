prove an insuperable bar to the introduction of any consider-
able manufactures in this neighbourhood: nor can this natu-
ral disadvantage be removed, except by rendering the Upper
Forth navigable for small vessels; and this seems to be an
object which might be accomplished at no great expence.
The fall of the river, in its whole course from the eastern
extremity of this parish, through the great moss, to Stirling,
is very inconsiderable; and the ground, consisting almost
wholly of moss and clay, is easily wrought.  It is well known,
that, about 30 years ago, this very undertaking was agita-
ted, and a particular estimate of the work, and of its ex-
pence, made out by Messrs Golborne and Watt, under the
direction of the late Lord Cathcart, then President of the
Board of Police.  But that scheme, which promised so fairly
for the mutual advantage of the Highlands and low country,
was, on some account or other, unfortunately abandoned.
It is to be hoped, that, in this age of public spirit and im-

be yet induced to procure the benefits of an inland naviga-

dance of running water, and of wood fitted for every kind of
machinery, seem to point out as a proper seat for cotton-
works and bleachfields.  Add to these natural advantages of
this neighbourhood, its inexhaustible rocks of slate, which, if
water-carriage could be obtained, would be alone sufficient to
supply the consumpt of the populous countries adjacent to
the banks of the Forth, from its source to the sea.  Here,
it would seem, that, in such an event, a woollen manufacture
might be advantageously established.  Situated in the very
opening of the Highlands, the wool of the western districts
of Perthshire, and the adjacent parts of Argyleshire, would
find a market of easy access; and the proprietors and oc-
cupiers of sheep farms might be induced to pay that atten-
