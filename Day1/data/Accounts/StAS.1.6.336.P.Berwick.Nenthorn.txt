     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF NENTHORN.

     (PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND
     TIVIOTDALE, COUNTY OF BERWICK.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ABRAHAM KER.

     Name, Extent, Surface etc.
   THE name is derived from some remarkable thorn trees.
The present incumbent remembers a very large one in the
parish.  The length of this district, from S. to N. is about 4
miles, and the breadth from E. to W. about as much*.  The
measurement is about 1900 acres.  It is mostly low ground
with a moderate descent to the S. except a rising in the north
part of the parish, the north side of which falls to the N.
The soil in some parts is remarkably good, a small part of the
north end, however, is very poor muir ground upon a deep
clay.  The air is good and healthy.

   Rent.-The real rent of the parish is about L. 2040.  The
inclosures are among the very best in Scotland for keeping cows

<FOOTNOTE>

*From Armstrong's map of Berwickshire, it appears the length of this pa-
rishes is only 2 1/4 miles and the breadth little more than 1 1/2.
