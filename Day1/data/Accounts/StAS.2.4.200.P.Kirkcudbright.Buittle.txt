                          PARISH OF BUITTLE.

     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.-" VARIOUS opinions," says Mr Maxwell, in the former

and Scotland, as Bootle near Liverpool, Bootle in Cumberland,
Wall-bootle on Severus' wall, New.bootle in Mid-Lotbian, El-bootie
in East-Lotbian, and Mer-botle, which is now Morbattle, in Rox-
