er, in the end, to lay on the full assessment of 12 s.  for a few
years, till all the roads are completely finished, and then to
reduce the assessment to 4 s.  which would be sufficient for

should pay the additional 6 s. and receive it afterwards from
the subsequent tenants at 2 s. a year, till the landlords be re-
imbursed.  A great turnpike road is now making between
Carlisle and Glasgow, which runs through the parish.  It

road, like all other turnpikes under proper management,
must be highly advantageous to the country.  The bridges
in the parish are good.  The only large one in it was ori-

Dumfries and stewartry of Galloway, as it is built over the
Cluden, which is the march between the two counties.  The
smaller ones, being all within the parish, were built, and are
kept in repair, by the parish.

standing in the year 1779, when it served for the parish
church.  These remains, however, were then pulled down,
and the materials used, in part, for building the present new
church.  The vestiges of the old abbey are sufficiently evi-
