from the old castle, and at once commands the charming
group of beauties, arising from the banks, the river, the
ruins, and the adjacent country.  The apartments, like the
great objects that surround them, are marked with a dig-
nified simplicity.  The banks are broad and extensive;
exhibit a very picturesque scene; have been much impro-
ved of late, with pleasure walks, huts and shrubbery.  The
walk from the house, along the summit of the bank, and
round the ruins, is most delightful.  Nature is truly Great;
her steps are carefully followed, and a good taste discover-
ed.  A grove of oaks occupies one part of the banks, al-
ready considerably advanced, and will make a venerable
figure in future times.  The park is inclosed with a re-
markably good wall.  There are few places more favour-
ed from situation, or capable of greater embellishment.
   The first who had the merit to discern the beauties of
these banks, even in their rude state, covered with natural
wood, and to plan and commence improvements, was the
late Lady Lucy Douglas*.
   With the finest moral feelings of the heart, the possessed
a well-cultivated mind, and a correct taste.  By arranging
these natural beauties, with the aid of her husband, she
produced a paradise.  Here she spent her leisure hours,
forgot the world, conversed with Nature, and its great
Author; and participated in those pleasures which were
pure, serene, and congenial to her own mind.
