     Statistical Account

   About twelve years ago, an act of parliament was obtained
for the better regulation of the statute work in the county of
Stirling.  By that act, instead of statute labour, leave is given
to asses the land in 18 s ster. for every L. 100 Scots of the
valued rent.

   Rivers.-The water of Endrick, famous for its trouts, rises
in our muirlands; and after running westward through the
parishes of Fintry, Balfron, Killearn, Drymen, and Buchan-
an, empties itself into Loch Lomond.
   Bannockburn (so called, (Majoris Historia) because on it
was made the meal of the bannocks, or panis cineritius of the
Romans; cakes toasted under the ashes were called bannocks),
receives its water partly from Loch Coulter, and partly from
the high lauds in the north west part of the parish.  It takes
its course towards the north east, and falls into the Forth with-
in the bounds of the parish.  This small river might be em-
ployed to great advantage by the manufacturer or artisan.
   The Carron runs along the southern boundary of the parish
for five miles and an hall The Poems of Ossian have mark`
ed the banks of this river as the scene of battle between the
Romans and the independent clans of the north.
   It has been thought, though it cannot be certainly deter-
mined, that the Earl's burn, the Earl's hill, a hill and a rivu-
let in the muirland part of the parish, derived their names from
the residence of some feudal baron or earl in the neigh-
bourhood of the Carron.  It is natural to suppose, that Gillies
hill, another hill in the muirland part of the parish, derives its
name from the name Gill or Gillies.  The names both of
Gillies and Morison occur in the muirlands.  It is certain,
that the fair lady, mother of Gill Morice, "lived on the Car-
ron side." This union of facts and probabilities suggests to
the imagination, though it cannot persuade the judgement
