                        IV.-INDUSTRY.
The parish of Dunino may be described as wholly agricultural.
A corn-mill stands on the estate of Stravithy ; and it may be noti-
ced, that the roof of the mill is supported by oak rafters that once
covered Cardinal Beaton's proud castle at St Andrews. This
corn.-mill is of powerful operation, and skilfully manufactures into
meal, at lod. Sterling, a boll of oats of the old Scottish measure.
Within seventy years, there were five corn-mills in the parish, one
on every estate save Kingsmuir, to which all the farmers were
bound for multure. These astrictions are now unknown.
The extent of the different properties in the parish in Scotch
acres, and the rent in the year 1836, may be found in the follow-
