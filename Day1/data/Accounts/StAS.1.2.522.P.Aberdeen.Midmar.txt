or put a sufficient man in his place.  Statute labour first took
place, in this district, about the year 1752.

   Cattle, Sheep, Husbandry, Utensils, Carriages, etc.-There
are in Midmar, according to a pretty exact estimate, 132
horses, 525 black cattle, and about 1955 sheep, 59 ploughs,
and 91 carts.  No waggons are necessary here, and no residing
heritor has a carriage.

   Healthiness, Longevity, Stature, Population, etc.-The
healthiness, and longevity of the inhabitants, is the surest
proof of the purity of the air of this region.  One of these,
Robert Mackay, died, some years ago, at the reputed age of
103; another, a respectable tenant, named John Mackay,
aged 90, died about the same time; and, of two women, na-
tives of the parish, one died in her 90th, the other in her
97th year.  The antient population cannot be exactly ascertain-
ed.  On the whole it has rather decreased.  The number of inha-
bitants at present is 945; between which, and the return to
Dr. Webster, of 979, in the year 1755, the difference however,
is inconsiderable.  During 10 years, from 1720 to 1730, the
annual average of marriages was 10, and the births 26; from
1780 to 1790, though the average marriages were the same,
the births were fallen to 20.  One principal cause of this dif-
ference will be found in the change, that has lately taken place,
in the manners of the people.  In the lower classes, the ex-
pense of dress, of convivial meetings, and other appendages
of luxury, have over-balanced the increase of wages, and the
profit of trade.  Among the better order of farmers, an emu-
lation takes place in these, as well as in other corresponding
articles.  Young men were enabled, during the former
period to marry early, by having practiced an economy,
which is now exploded by the fashion of the times.-
