ployed in the work, amounted to 17.  Their labours afforded
employment to above 40 carriers, all women, who retailed
the salt in Edinburgh, and through the neighbouring districts.
The quantity of salt delivered by the six pans, regularly em-
ployed, used to be about 18,000 bushels annually.

   Coal.-Thirteen seams of coal have been discovered and
wrought upon the estate of Dudingston.  These are of vari-
ous qualities, and some excellent in their kinds.  They crop,
as indeed the strata of all minerals upon this coast preserve the
same inclination, to the west; the dip or declination, is nearly at
an angle of 45 degrees from the horizon to the east, a circumstance
which of itself must always have rendered the working of the
coal difficult.  Most of the above seams have been wrought
from a very remote period of time, which cannot now be as-
certained, where they approach the surface, and as far as a
simple free level could clear them of water.  Under the Du-
chess of Argyle, a rude machine composed of, and named,
chain and buckets, was employed to raise the water in the
mines from a greater depth.  When the property fell into
the possession of the late Earl of Abercorn, the coal and salt
works were at first let to Mr Biggar of Woolmet, an enter-
prising man, who opened a level from the sea, and carried it
through the estates of Dudingston, Niddry, and part of Ed-
monston, up to Woolmet bank, a powerful drain of above
3 miles in extent, of most essential advantage to the more cle-
vated coal works of the neighbouring proprietors, but even-
tually productive of ruin to that of Dudingston, besides
opening the generating source of interminable law pleas.
About the year 1763, the Earl of Abercorn began to erect a
steam engine of very considerable power upon the Dudingston
coalliery, extending its operation to the depth of 52 fathoms.
This engine was rendered useless in 1790, when on the 20th
