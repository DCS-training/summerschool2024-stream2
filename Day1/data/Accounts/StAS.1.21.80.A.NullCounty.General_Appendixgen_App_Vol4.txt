each hundred of person, it will take L. 75,000 to maintain
the parochial poor in this part of the island; a sum which
one would think altogether insufficient, comparing it with
the expence of supporting the poor in England, where I sup-
pose there are 7,000,000 of people.  By my computation it
would require only L. 350,000 to supply the poor of Eng-
land, instead of L. 2,000,000, which I am informed is the
sum it really costs.
   To a gentleman of your penetration, I need not observe,

not so much from necessity as from proftigacy, and a desire
to wander, rather than to be supported on a fixed residence
by the parishes to which they belong.

by voluntary contributions; when that mode fails, however,
or is likely to fail, which was the case for the first time in
1757 application is made to the Earl of Hopeton, the fole
proprietor of this parish, who grants an assestment generally
to the amount of L. 20 sterling; the one half to be paid by
himself the other by his tenants in proportion to their rents,
as law directs; and when an assessment has been necessary it
has not hitherto been scrupled neither by the proprietor nor
his tenants, for if it were, application might be made to the
