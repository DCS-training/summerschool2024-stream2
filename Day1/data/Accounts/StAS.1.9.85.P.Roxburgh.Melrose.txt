   The prevailing diseases in the parish are consumptions
and rheumatisms.  The latter may be owing to the severe
cold to which the lower classes are exposed during the win-
ter, from the vast expense of fuel, which cannot be used to
such extent as is necessary for their health and accommo-
dation.  Coal, their principal fuel, is distant a mile farther
than lime, and sells at 9 d. and 10 d. the hundred weight in

sided.  This may be owing to the improvement of the
country by drains, and to the people's being better fed and

pressed their gratitude.  It is hoped, that in a short time, a
practice will become universal, which has been already
begun, and through the blessing of God, will continue to
be a mean of saving many infants from an early grave.

   Religion, etc.-Notwithstanding the many religious secta-
ries which exist here, a spirit of mutual forbearance pre-
vails.  That inveterate rancour, to which the divisions
in our church gave birth about 50 years ago, is now almost
worn away through the friendly aid of time, the only cure
for such an evil.  All parties are disposed to live in peace,
and to interchange the offices of good neighbourhood with
one another.  In so large a society, as may be expected,
exceptions must be made.  In general, however, the peo-
ple have always been distinguished for their good sense,
