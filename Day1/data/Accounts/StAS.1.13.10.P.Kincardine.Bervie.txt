*Extract of a letter addressed to Sir John Sinclair, April 26 1793, hy
the Rev.  Mr Croll.  "For a great many years before the present manu-
factures were established here, the number of catechisable persons, that
it, those at or above eight years, amounted to about 400.  Since the intro-
duction of the manufactures, that is, in about 15 years and 6 months, the 
number of catechisable persons is more that 800; and I support the num-
ber of souls to be about 1200 at least."
