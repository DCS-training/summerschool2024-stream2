of graves are still manifest, and at which there is a most
copious and excellent spring well.  There is also the vestige
of the chapel at Quaas 1/4 mile W. of Lockerbie, the font-
stone of which serves for the market cross of Lockerbie to
this day.  The most lofty and beautiful hill, (for there are
no mountains in the parish,) is Whitewynd or White Woolen,
carpetted with an unvaried green, being an excellent pastu-

of considerable heighth and steepness; on its summit there is
a spacious plain, in the centre whereof is a mound or mote,

pint, butter at 8 d. and 9 d. the pound, new cheese at 3 d. the
pound, and old cheese from 5 s. to 8 s. the stone, heavy weight,
being 24 ounces to the pound.  The farmers preferring
black cattle to sheep, there is only one or two sheep stocks
in the parish, yet there are a great number of pets and 3
