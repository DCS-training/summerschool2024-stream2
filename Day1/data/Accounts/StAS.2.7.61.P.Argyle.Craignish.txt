climate is peculiarly adapted. Plantations of wood should, also be,
formed, as there are many eminences at present of little value, and
assuredly of no beauty, which, if planted with oak, ash, andb larch,
the timber in most demand for rural purposes, might, at a mode-
rate expense, be rendered at once highly productive and extremely
ornamental. A few slopes there are, throughout the peninsula, in
which stools of native oak are so numerous, that, if protected by
enclosures from the browsing of sheep and black-cattle, they would,
in a brief term of years, be adorned by thriving trees.
