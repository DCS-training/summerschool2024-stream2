which vary in extent from 4 to 6 acres each.  Originally,
they belonged to 64 distinct proprietors, burgesses of El-
gyn.  The soil of a great part of this ground is good, being
a rich loam, over a clay bottom; and the whole might be
greatly improved, were the separate parts thrown into one
connected field; but they lie in run-rig, and so disjoined,
that different portions, of the same lot, may be almost an
English mile asunder.  The Lossie is making great encroach-
ments on some of them; and as they still are the property of
a number of differnt persons, though many of them have
been acquired by one individual, no common measure has been
adopted, to imbank the river, which might be done by
piles, at a small expence.  These havocks of the river, have
discovered in different places, a foot or two thick of excel-
lent peat moss, buried from 4 to 6 feet, under the loam and
clay.  It is uncertain, who originally granted these lands to
the 64 burgesses of Elgyn.  Tradition has uniformly re-
ported, that they were given, as a compensation, to the fami-
lies of men who had fallen in battle, on some important oc-
casion*.

   Pluscarden.-The ruins of the priory of Pluscarden, in
the west end of this parish, are truly magnificent.  The
church was never completed, as the foundations of the west
part of the cross were only laid.  There are small pieces of
fresco painting, that remain under an arch in the church,
which are tolerably accurate in the design, and the colours
lively.  The mill for grinding their corns, was within the
high free-stone walls, that surrounded their burying-ground,
etc.  Their gardens were excellent.  A fig-tree was there
