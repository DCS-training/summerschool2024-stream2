mand an extensive view of Strathmore. It presents a precipitous front
of rocks to the south and south-west. On the otherside, altbough
steep, it is covered with a most vivid green sward forming a re-
markable contrast with the heath-clad hills of Seidlaw, which ad-
join it. Its top is surrounded with a high wall of earth and
stones, supposed to bave been 127 feet high and 20 broad; it
contains within it, upwards of one acre and has been a place of
great strength. An ancient toft close by its side still retains the
name of "Pict's Mill" On the top of Hayston hill, an arm of
the Seidlaw, on the east side of the parish, there is a small cir-
cular moat surrounded with a clay dike, which was probably a
Roman station for observation. There is another moat exactly
similar on the Glammiss property, in the adjoining parish of
Airlie.
	When the Loch of Forfar was drained, some Roman camp-
kettles of brass were found, and an iron battle-axe, now preserved
in the castle. Other Roman weapons have been found in the
mosses.

ern division, and the greater part of the central, with the glen of

side of the central division.
