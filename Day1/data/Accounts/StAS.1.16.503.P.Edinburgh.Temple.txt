     of Temple.

patronage of the first belonged to lands the property of
Dundas of Arniston, and that of the other two to lands the
property of Hepburn of Clerkington.  From the union of
these chapels arose, at an early period, the present parish
of Temple; and the right of presentation to it has followed
that of the original establishment, Mr Dundas having one
vice of it, and Mr Hepburn two.  The stipend is paid
partly in money and partly in grain, and amounts to L. 82,
16 s. 8 d. at the legal rate of converting grain by the Court
of Teinds.  The glebe is small, and the value of it to the
minister is still farther diminished, by the arable part of it
being at a distance from the manse, and uninclosed.  The
manse is an old house, and has lately undergone a partial
repair.  The church is an old Gothic building, is ill seated,
and very cold in winter, from having bad doors, and no
cieling.

   Manufactures.-There has as yet been no manufacture
carried on in the parish; but lately a company from Eng-
land have begun to build a mill for making gun-powder.
This is the first erection of the kind in Scotland.
