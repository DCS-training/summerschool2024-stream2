     of Cupar of Fife.

said to have almost no begging poor belonging to it, yet
is no town perhaps in, Scotland, of the same extent, where
a greater number are daily seen infesting the streets.  Cupar
being the principal thoroughfare, on the great turnpike road
leading through the county of Fife, and no plan being stea-

from begging in Cupar, and to apprehend all vagrant stran-

ciety.  Whoever has lived in England; whoever has paid
attention to the legal provision made in that country, for the
maintenance of the poor; whoever has witnessed the for-
midable amount to which the tax in some districts rises, how
