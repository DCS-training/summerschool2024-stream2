place in the spring, by which it is sometimes raised almost
wholly out of the ground, before it is possible, from the
wetness of the soil, to have it rolled to advantage.

   Farms and Farm-Houses.-The extent of the farms are
in general, from 50 to 100 acres.  At a medium about 70.  It is
but of late that the landlords have begun to pay any attention
to the farm houses on their estates.  In general, however, a
stranger still views, with concern, the poor and mean-looking
huts, in which the farmers are condemned to dwell, through-
out all this country.  Their habitation, and that of their cat-
tle, are generally under the same roof, and only separated
from one another by partitions.  Scarcely any of them have
an upper story, so that the whole family are obliged to sleep
upon the ground, on a damp soil, where the floor is not so
much as paved with stone or flags, and where there is not e-
ven a fire place to draw off the moist and stagnant air.  This
must be attended with the worst consequences to the health of
the people; whereas, were better and more comfortable houses
provided for the tenants, it would be a great inducement to them
to pay better rents for their farms, and it would even be a means of
enabling them to do so, by giving them greater security for their
health, and rendering them better able attend to their business.
Every house, therefore, ought to have as much of it raised to a
second story, as would furnish the whole family with sufficient
room to sleep above stairs, with vents in every sleeping apart-
ment, in which fires might be put, occasionally, and, which, at
any rate, would act as ventilators, and, by keeping up the circu-
lation of fresh air, would render consumptive complaints, at
present so fatal, must less frequent.
