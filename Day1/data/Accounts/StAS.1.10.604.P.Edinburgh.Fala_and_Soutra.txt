  Village and Sectaries. - The only village in the parish, is
  Fala, which consists of a few miserable cottages, and con-
  tains about 100 inhabitants, young and old. - And the only
  dissenters are the Burgher Seceders. They have built a
  house in the village for public worship, as well as a house for
  their minister. The meeting, however, is not very nume-
  rous, and is chiefly made up from the neighbouring parishes.
  
  Employments, Wages, and Manners. - As no foreign trade
  or manufactory is carried on in the parish, the inhabitants
  are mostly employed in agriculture. There are, however, 2
  wrights, 1 smith, 1 baker, 3 masons, 3 taylors, and 3 wea-
  vers. A manufactory of cotton might be established here
  with some advantage, as there is plenty of water for the
  movement of the machinery, and the great road from Edin-
  burgh to London leads directly through the village. - Every
  kind of mechanical work is fully as high priced here as in
  Edinburgh. Male servants, employed in husbandry, have
  from 6l. to 9l. and female servants from 3l. to 4l. Sterling
  of yearly wages, exclusive of bed and board. Day-labourers
  have from 1s. to 1s. 6d. per day. The manners of the
  common people are, in general, rather rough. This parti-
  cular trait of character is, in some measure, owing to the 
  scarcity
