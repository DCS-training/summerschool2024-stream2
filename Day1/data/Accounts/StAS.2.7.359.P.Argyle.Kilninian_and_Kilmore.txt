of road made, and bridges built, low country capital and enter-
prise would find their way more readily than they have been doing,
into this district; the face of the country would undergo a tho-
rough and beneficial chan-e ; and this portion of the empire,
hitherto so much neglected, would assume and hold that position
which the capabilities of its soil, sea coast, and climate so justly
eiititle it to.
