souls was 577.  The list at this time was exactly taken.
Whether the following year's list was equally exact, I
know not, but find it set down at 544.  This being a
year of particular scarcity of meal, perhaps the difference
of 33 is to be accounted for by fewer servants being en-
gaged by the smaller tenants and tradesmen, and by al-
lowing their own children to go forth to service.  The
year following it is up again at 573, and continues about
that till 1788, when I find 613; and since that time, it
has ben about 600.  The medium of souls then of these
different years is,                  596

   There are but few tradesmen, and mechanicks in the
parish.  There are 5 square wrights, with about as many
journeymen and apprentices; 3 wheelwrights; to wea-
vers; 4 shoemakers; 2 smiths; 1 tailor; and 2 good old
soldiers; discharged and superannuated, enjoying each his
pension, sober and industrious, and of course thriving.
There is a smith, an elder of the church, and a miller fit
to be one.  There is 1 boat within the parish, the boat of
Muirish, belonging to Lord Banff; and another, the boat
of Ashoyle, belonging to Mr. Leslie of Donlugass, and
lands upon it a little below the house of Forglen*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Boat of Muirish is the only publick house in the parish.  There is
no manufactory of any kind.  There are two or three merchants who
retail some small articles, and some of them give out lint to span, and
take in the yarn for manufacturers in Banff and Huntly.
