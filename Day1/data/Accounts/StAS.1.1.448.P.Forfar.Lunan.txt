for his flock.  The names of some places are evidently deri-
ved from the Gaelic, as the name of the parish, and Dunbart-
net (called also Drumbartnet) from Dun a hill, which is so na-
med from being situated on an eminence.  There is a salmon
fishery at the mouth of the river, but it has been very un-
productive for several years past, yielding nothing but trout,
with which the river formerly abounded.  They are now
much destroyed by the steeping of slax, large quantities of
which have of late years been raised in the district.  It is not
improbable but this operates also as a cause of the salmon
having deserted the bay, where they were sometimes caught
in great plenty.  The fishery is annexed to the farm of Lu-
nan, and no particular rent specified for it.  Besides the sta-
ted rent, tenants, in some instances, are bound to give their
landlords, in the summer, one draught of their carts; their
servants a day in the hay-harvest; and their reapers a day in
autumn.  The difficulty of getting people to hire at a time
when all are busy, is the reason assigned for continuing to
exact the two last.  Tenants require like services of their
subtenants; but they are always limited to a certain number
of days, and seldom exceed three or four yearly.  Tenants in
general complain more of being obliged to grind their corn
at some particular mill, and pay high stipulated multures, a
custom which prevails almost universally in North Britain,
than of these trivial services, which are seldom exacted so ri-
gorously as to make them distressing.  The fuel commonly
used in summer is turf, or broom, valued from 1 s. to 2 s. a
cart load, of which there is plenty in the parish; and, in 
winter, coals, 70 stone of which, called a boll, cost 6 s. at
Arbroath, where no duty is exacted.
