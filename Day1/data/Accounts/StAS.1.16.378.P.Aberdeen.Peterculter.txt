   Thunder and Lightning.- On Saturday, 10th July
1779, we were visited here by a fatal thunder-storm.  The
morning of that day was bright and hot.  At noon the he-
misphere was overcast.  A storm gathered in the north,
and made its progress southward over this place.  About
3 o'clock the explosion of the thunder-cloud, then vertical
to us, was tremendous indeed.  At that instant, a farmer's
son with two servants were loading their carts, on a heath
about a mile south, with stone's for building the church.
The two servants, and two of the horses were killed.  The
farmer's son was struck to the ground, and remained some
time in a state of insensibility.  Next evening, the two,
servants were buried here in one grave.  A stone was set
up at the fatal spot, with the initials of their names.

   The ancient poet's verses may be philosophic, but are
not sufficiently-descriptive e of the thunder-storm which I
have mentioned:

     "Fulgit item, nubes ignis cum semina multa
     "Excussere suo concursu, ceu lapidem si
     "Percutiat lapis, aut ferrum; nam tum quoque lumen
     "Exsilit, et claras scintillas dissipat ignis,
     "Sed tonitru sit, uti post auribus accipiamus,
     "Fulgere' quam cernant oculi, quia semper ad aures
     "Tardius adveniunt, quam visum quæ moveant res."

     
     "Quick lightning flies, when heavy clouds rush on,
     "And strike, as steel and flint, or stone and stone;
     "For then small sparks appear, and scatter'd light
     "Breaks swiftly forth, and wakes the sleepy night.

     
     Hic iterum situs est Cancri, cum sidere Phoebus
     Solstitium facit, et summo versatur Olympo.

     
     Past summer solstice, Phoebus had borne the day
     Through Cancer's sign, and driven the highest way.
