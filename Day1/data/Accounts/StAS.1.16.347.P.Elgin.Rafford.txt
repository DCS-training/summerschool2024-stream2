     of Rafford.

   The Reverend Mr Cordiner of Banss, in his letters to
Mr Pennant on the antiquities and scenery of the north of
Scotland, has exhibited a fine drawing of this monument,
and his remarks on it appear to be more satisfactory than
any I have read.  He supposes it to have been erected in
memory of the peace concluded between Malcom and Ca-
nute, upon the final retreat of the Danes from the king-
dom.  This event is said to have happened about the year
1012.
   But to whatever transaction it may allude, it can hardly
be imagined, that in so early an age of the arts in Scot-
land as it must have been raised, so elaborate a performance
would have been undertaken but in consequence of an
event of the most general importance.  It is therefore sur-
prising, that no more distinct traditions of it reached to the
æra when letters were known.
