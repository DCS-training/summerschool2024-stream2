three small possessions having been thrown into one; and
likewise to some large farms having been let to farmers who
reside in other parishes, and who only keep an overseer and
a few servants at their farms here.  In November 1791, the
number of people amounted only to 460; whereas, accor-
ding to the report sent to Dr. Webster, in 1755, the number
was 755.  The number of births in this parish, do not ex-

and the marriages not more than 2 annually.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent is 2842 L. 11 s.
Scotch.  The real rent is not less than 1000 L. Sterling.  The
number of proprietors is 7, none of whom reside in the pa-
rish; the number of tenants 40, some of whom pay from
60 L. to 100 L. of yearly rent.  At present there reside 2
shoemakers, 3 taylors, 4 weavers, and 1 square wright.  A
taylor commonly receives, along with this victuals, 6 d. a day;
the wright and labouring servants, 8 d. with their victuals.

   Fairs.-There is an annual fair, which is indeed the only
one in this parish, held in the month of August, about half
a mile north from the manse, called St. Jame's Fair.  It is
now one of the largest in the county.  There is commonly

ready sale for them.  It is singular circumstance, that the
ground upon which the market stands belongs to the Earl of
Kintore, and yet the duties arising from it, have, from time

heritor.

   Ecclesiastical State.-There is a commodious and sufficient
church, built in the year 182.  The manse stands much in
need of reparation.  It was built upwards of 50 years ago,
