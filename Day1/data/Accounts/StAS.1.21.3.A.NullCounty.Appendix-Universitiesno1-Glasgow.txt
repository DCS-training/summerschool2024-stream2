     of the University of Glasgow.

have no account of the solemity and ceremony of the first
establishment; but it appears that DAVID CADZOW, licentiate
in canon-law, and canon of Glasgow, was the first rector, (pro-
bably appointed by tile bishop), and that he was, by election,
continued in 1452.  There are more than 100 members men-
tioned, as incorporated by him in these two years; and most of
them not young men, but secular or regular ecclesiastics, ca-
nons, rectors, vicars, and presbyters, abbots, priors, and monks.
ANDREW STEWART, brother to King James II. was incor-
porated in 1456, being then sub-dean of Glasgow.

   Exemptions.-The clergy would perhaps be the more dis-
posed to attend the University, as, while they were incorpo-
rated members, they were, by royal charters and acts of Par-
liament, exempted from all taxes and public burdens.  And
Bp. TURNBULL, in the year 1453, ordained, That the beneficed
clergy in his diocese, who were regents or students in his uni-
versity, or willing to study while they were teachable, should,
upon asking his licence, be exempted from residence in their
cures, providing they took care to have the religious offices du-
ly performed.

   Royal Charter.-King JAMES II. in the year 1453, at the re-
quest of Bp. Turnbull, granted a charter in favour of the Uni-
versity of Glasgow; by which the rector, the deans of the fa-
culties, the procurators of the four nations, the masters, regents,
and scholars, studying in the said University, providing they
be not prelates, as well as the beadals, writers, stationers, and
parchment-makers, are exempted ab omnibus tributis, muneri-
bus, exactionibus, taxationibus, collectis, vigiliis, et pedagiis, ali-
quo modo infra regnum nostrum statuendis et levandis.

   Privileges and Powers.-The same privilege was renewed
