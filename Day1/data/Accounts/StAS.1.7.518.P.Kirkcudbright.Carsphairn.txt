merly to sweep away the half of a stock, but seldom now
make very great havock.  The means to prevent the former
is to stock light, and after bad seasons to sell off every one
that is suspected.  The best method of preventing the latter,
is to take the young sheep which are most liable to it either
to a different farm, or to another part of the same farm,
where the quality of the soil is different.  The cure of either
is never attempted, though there can be no doubt it would
often succeed, if the diseased sheep were observed on the
first attack.  The proper cure of the rot would be salt mar-
shes, or house feeding.  The sickness is an inflammation of the
intestines, and ought certainly to be treated by bleeding, in-
jections, and warm fermentation.
   In one or two farms a disease also prevails termed the
vanquish.  It arises from feeding on dry barren moss, void of
all nourishment, to which the creatures are so attached, that
they will never leave it till they die of emaciation.  In this
disease the horns usually become red.  This disease almost
constantly proves fatal, unless the sheep are removed to the
low grounds, and put on better pasture, which always ope-
rates a cure.
   Another disease very common on some farms is termed
the gripping.  This is evidently a paraletic or nervous affec-
tion, where one or more of the limbs, or sometimes the whole
body is affected.  It might probably be cured by laudanum.
The cold bath is often used with advantage.
   The sturdy or hydrocephalus is also a well known disease
among the sheep.  It admits of no cure but cutting and ta-
king out the water, which sometimes proves successful, even
when performed by the coarse hand of the shepherd, with no
other instrument than a common knife.
