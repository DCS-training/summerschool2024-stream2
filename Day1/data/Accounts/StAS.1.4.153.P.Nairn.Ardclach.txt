     of Ardtlach.

mixed breed answer best.-The rental produced before the
Court of Teinds, in a process of augnentation in the year
1786, was 283 bolls victual, and L. 543: 8: 5 in money.
Since that period, there has been an increase of rent in se-
veral parts of the parish, and the heritors propose giving
leafes in general for 19 years.  The sole dependence of the
tenants is on their cattle.  From their want to leases, as
well as the barrenness of the soil, they found it their inte-
rest to rear as many black cattle as they possibly could.  It
is supposed there are about 2000 acres of arable land, and
4000 acres consisting of moss and morr, a very small part
of which seems to be improvable for corn-lands.

   Manufacturers.-The principal manufactures are plaiden,
which is reckoned the best in the country, and coarse tar-
tan, with a kind of broad cloth and duffle.  Within these
5 years wool has sold at 18 s. the stone.  Attempts have
been made to raise flax, without success.  There are no
less than 5 licensed distilleries, which are supplied with
barley and malt from the low country.  Their licenses are
below L. 40.  It might be thought the the distilling of so
much whisky, would be attended with the worst of conse-
quences to the morals of the people; but this has not pro
ved to be the case.  As this parish abounds with moss for
peats, and moss-fir, a considerable number were in use of
making whisky in a smuggling way, and so had an oppor-
tunity of drinking more than was proper for them; but
since the establishedment of licensed distilleries, this practice
has been checked, and the people are become more fober  
than formerly.  There is no inn within the parish, but one
at Dulcy bridge, on the highland road to Edinburgh.

   Prices and Wages.-The nearest markets for butcher-
meat are Forres and Nairne, about 12 miles distant from
     Vol. IV. U
