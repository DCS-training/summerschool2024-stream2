     of Aberdeen.

   Mr Gordon having died about the year 1731, his assig-
nees obtained possession of his funds; and from the produce
of them purchased an acre, and built a proper house for the
Hospital.  When the funds had accumulated to a proper
degree, they took in boys, and the institution has gone on
since with remarkable success; and there are at present
maintained, clothed, and educated in it 60 boys, at the an-
nual expence of upwards of L. 1000 Sterling, which the
Governors are now enabled to afford, by the early purchase
of lands, and afterwards feuing them out to great advan-
tage.
   The branches of education taught in this hospital are,
reading English, English-grammar, writing, arithmetic,
book-keeping, the elements of geometry, navigation, geo-
graphy, French, church-music; and such of the boys as dis-
cover a genius for it, are instructed in drawing also.  These
branches of education, together with a proper instruction
in the principles of the Christian religion, are carried on
under the direction of three masters, who constantly reside
in the house; the drawing master being only employed
occasionally, and mostly during the summer; and the ma-
ster for church-music attending twice or thrice a-week.
   The boys must not be under nine years of age when ad-
mitted into the Hospital, and must leave it at 16 years of
age.  They are put to proper trades, under the direction
of the Governors; L. 8:6:8 Sterling are allowed for ap-
prentice-fee; and, upon finishing their apprenticeship, they
are allowed each L. 5 Sterling to assist them in entering in-
to business.
   Anno 1772, the Governors judged it proper, for remo-
ving objections to their management, to apply to his Ma-
jesty for a charter of incorporation, and it was obtained, in-
corporating them under the name and title of, The President
and Governors of Robert Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen.
