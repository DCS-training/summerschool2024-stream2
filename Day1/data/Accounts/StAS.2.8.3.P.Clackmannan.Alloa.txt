         "And, brightening all, the Forth, with gentle pride,
          Gliding along the vernal-verdured shore,
        Calm, clear, and mighty, deep and dignified,
          Constant as day, abundant as of yore;
        So that the valley laughs to see his tide
        Lie in its lovely lap, and sport from side side!"
  The Firth of Forth  and the adjacent scenery seem to have
undergone little alteration, in their general outline at least, since
they were described by Sir Robert Sibbald, about one hundred
and thirty years ago as follows:-

           "Tot campos, aylvas, tot regia tecta, tot hortos
           Artifici dextra excultos, tot vidimus arces,
           Ut nuno Ausonia, Fortha cum Tibride certet.

           Such fields, such woods, such stately, piles appear,
           Such gardens grace the earth, such towers the air,
           That Forth with Romah Tiber may compare."

   The height above the level of the Forth of some of the rising
grounds of this parish was ascertained, by barometrical measure-
ment, on the 5th October 1839, expressly for this Account. by
Mr John Mackie, Mining-Engineer, F. G. S. Gartmorn Hill,
the highest of these, is at the north-eastern extremity of this pa-
rish, and is 390 feet.

marked, in 1822, as having put on a milder aspect; and many
