   Day-labourers 9s. per week, bondagers, 4s. 6d. but not employ-
ed every day,-only at call of the master.
   Husbandry.-Tyle draining, lately introduced, promises mate-
rially to improve tenacious soils. Bruised bones and rape-dus tender
the distant farmer almost independent of dung as a manure. Cattle
likewise at two years old are brought to the same perfection, with re-
gard to weight and fat as formerly at three. Altogether a great im-
petus has lately been given to agriculture in all its branches. Land-
lords are too enlightened not to see it to be their interest to give
every encouragement to the tenantry; and Mrs. H. N. Ferguson
takes the lead in all that is liberal.

                  V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

Dunbar is the nearest market-town, distant about five miles.
   Villages.-Stenton and Petcox. The latter for ages gave the
name to the parish. In olden times it was a rectory, and a Mr
Cockburn, the rector, was the first Protestant minister of Hadding-
ton. He does not seem to have been a zealous Protestant, how-
ever; for in 1564 and 1565 he was complained of for absenting him-
self from the General Assembly. In Bagimont's roll, the Rec-
tory of Petcox is rated at L.2, 13s. 4d.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The church stands near the west boundary
of the parish, and not very convenient for a part of the population.
All the sittings are free. The manse was built in 1783 and re-
paired in 1820, having been struck by lightning. The glebe is
71/2 acres in extent. Rent 9 quarters wheat at second fiars. Sti-
