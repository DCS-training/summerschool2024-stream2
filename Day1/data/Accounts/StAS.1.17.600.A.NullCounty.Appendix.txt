water of this spring, which is extremely clear, has somewhat
of a bitterish taste, and gives a darker tint to the freestone
rock, down which it runs to the river below.  With a trif-

the orchard, then at the foot of the easter recess, gave or-

His mother arriving at the castle, in quest of her son, was
