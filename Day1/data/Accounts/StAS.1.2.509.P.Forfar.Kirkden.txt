ritors families.  Many families have no occasion to hire
servants, having a sufficient number of children to perform
their work.  And the sauciness of single servants makes others
engage cottagers, whole family ties make them more dependant
and humble.  Thus evil produces good, and pride prevents depo-
pulation.  Each of these married labourers has a house and
yard; a cow maintained summer and winter; 52 stones of
meal; the carriage of their coals and other fuel; and com-
monly, some ground allowed them for lint: and some of them
have L. 5, some L. 6, and some of them L. 7 in money.  Be-
sides these servants, reapers are engaged for harvest; a good
female shearer about L. 1, and a male at about L. 1: 6.  All
the inhabitants ate of the established religion, except the re-
siding heritors, and 1 or 2 in their families, in all about a
dozen, who belong to the church of England; and about
21 Antiburgher Seceders, including children.

   General Character.-The inhabitants of this parish,
with very few exceptions, are an industrious, civilized, and
contented people.  No person has been banished from it, nor
beem guilty of murder, suicide, or any atrocious crime, with-
in the present century; if we except those, who, from mistak-
en loyalty, followed the Pretender, in 1745.

   Christmas is held as great festival in this neighbourhood.
On the day "the servant is free from his master," and goes
about visiting his friends and acquaintance.  The poorest must
have beef or mutton on the table, and what they call a dinner
with their friends.  Many amuse themselves with various di-
versions, particularly with shooting for prizes, called here
wad-shooting.  And many do but little business all the Christ-
mas week; the evening of almost every day being spent in a-
musement.  All the lower classes of the people still observe 
the old stile.
