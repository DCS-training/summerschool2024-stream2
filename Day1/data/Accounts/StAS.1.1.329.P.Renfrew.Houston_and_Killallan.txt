     of Houstown and Killallan.

   Upon the south wall of the aile there is a large frame of
timber, on which 2 pictures, seemingly done with oil colours,
but much worn out.  On the right side, a man in complete
armour, resembling that of a Knight Templar, with an in-
scription in Saxon characters over his head, some words of
which are effaced-His jacet Dominus Joannes Houstoun de
eodem miles, qui obiir anno Dom. MCCCC*-On the left hand
a picture of his lady, also much effaced, and over her head
the following inscription:-Hic jacet Domina Maria Colqu-
houn, sponsa quondam dicti Domini Joannis, qua obut septi-
mo die mensis Octobris, an Dom MoCCCCo-quinto.-On the
same side of the aile is a fine monument, with a variety of
emblematical figures, part of fine free stone, but most of it
stucco.  On the top is the image of an old man, with long
flowing hair, and a crown on his head, with a loose robe,
having one foot on a large globe, with a small image on each
side, holding a trumpet to their mouth.  Across the globe is
a chain hanging down on each side, and sixed below; where
there are, in a standing posture, two images resembling chil-
dren, each holding a link of the chain:  The one on the right
hand has three faces; the other, on the left hand, is blind-
folded, as with a cloth bound over the eyes.  There are se-
veral other figures on the fides, and below the following in-
scription:

   Hic sita Est Domina Anna Hamiltonia, dilectissima Domini
Patricii Houstoun, de codem, Baronetti, conjux sua, quae obiit
tertio die idus Maias, anno salutis partae, milesimo sexcente-
simo et septuagesimo-octavo.

   There have been several urns, with ashes of human bones,
found both in Houstoun and Killallan.  One was lately found
in the brow of a hill on the road side; and others have been
found
