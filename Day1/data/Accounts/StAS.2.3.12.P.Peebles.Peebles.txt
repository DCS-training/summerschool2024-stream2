   From the 1st of January 1827 to the 1st of January 1833, the
number of proclamations was 134, giving an average of 22 1/2 yearly.
Of these cases, when both parties belonged to the parish, the num-
ber was 79; and 55 when only one belonged to the parish.
   The number of baptisms, as recorded from the beginning of
1827 to the end of 1832, is 284, averaging 47 1/3 a-year. But,
as many of the dissenters do not register the births of their child-
ren, the above list is considerably below the number of children
born.
   As the church-yard has been for some years past carefully watch-
ed, the remains of persons belonging to other parishes are fre-
quently brought rather for interment; a very accurate return, there-
fore, of the number of deaths in this parish cannot be given. But
as nearly as  can be calculated, the average number of deaths may
be stated at 47 a-year, for several years past. From 1780 to 1789,
inclusive, the yearly average was 48; from 1790 to the end of
the century the number was 31 a-year; and from 1800 to 1809,
inclusive, it was 48, a-year.

   It is not probable that there will be any great increase of popu-
lation either in the burgh or landward part of the parish for many
years to come. Hamlets have disappeared; and no more cottages
are kept up than what are sufficient for the accommodation of the

<FOOTNOTE> The number of males returned was probably less than it ought to have been,
owing to the reluctance of the young much to be dilletted for the militia, and their
names being therefore suppressed.

Town, 537; in the New Town, 1563; in the land ward part of the parish, 717;
making a total of 2817.
