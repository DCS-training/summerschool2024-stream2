Whether the common people should receive education?  Hu-
manity revolts from the idea.  Facts prove ignorance to be
pernicious.

   Poor.-The sum expended annually for their support is
nearly, at an average, 70 L.  In the year 1782, it was 112 L.
None below 60 years of age are received upon the pension
list, as an admission, it is thought, to an aliment that is cer-
tain, at an earlier period, might be unfriendly to their industry,
and to the honest pride, which ought to be cherished in the
lowest classes, of eating their own bread.  When any, how-
ever, below that age, are in distress, they never fail to receive
a proper supply; and the sum given away in this manner,
is not less than what is expended for the pension list.-No
where, probably, do the poor receive a larger allowance, or
meet with more cordial attention.  Indeed the funds of the
parish, though they have entirely arisen, excepting a dona-
tion of 100 l. from collections since the year 1704, are now
so considerable as to supply these charitable demands, and
preclude any chance of an assessment at a future period.  The
practice followed hitherto by the residing heritors, of not al-
lowing the collections to be lessened, by their occasional ab-
sence from public worship, has tended greatly to increase these
funds.  Were this practice to take place in other parishes,
and to be adopted also by non-residing heritors, (and no good
reason can be assigned why it should not), it is likely that
assessments, so much and so justly dreaded, would, in most
cases, be avoided: For though the farmers know they have
only a temporary interest in these funds, and the lowest class
are aware that it belongs not to them, in any view of the
matter, to maintain the poor, it is not to be doubted that
both these classes would continue, as hitherto, from a reli-
