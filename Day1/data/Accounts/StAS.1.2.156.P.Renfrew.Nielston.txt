   The church was built in 1762; and it is believed will hold
about 1000 people.  It is ornamented with a neat spire and a
clock.-About two years ago, a number of heads of fami-
lies who had little, and some of them no room in the church,
offered the heritors the sum of L. 80, for adding to, or enlarg-
ing an aisle in it, upon the single condition that the seats of
this addition should be annually let, by public roup, to parishi-
oners only, and the money arising from them given to the
poor.  But the heritors did not chuse to accept of this offer.
Had this plan taken place, it is the opinion of many, that it
would not only have been a considerable accommodation to
the parishioners, but would have made such an addition to the
poors funds, as would have prevented the necessity of an assess-
ment for maintaining the poor for many years, which otherwise
may become indispensable.

   The school-house was built large, and commodious, last
year, with a dwelling-house in the upper story for the teach-
er.  The heritors also gave an area before the school-house,
for the benefit of the children, and a garden to the school-mas-
ter behind.  The salary is L. 8: 6: 8.  He may have between
60 and 70 scholars;-wages per quarter for Latin 3 s, arithme-
tic 2 s 6 d. writing 2 s, English 1s 6 d.-also 3 d. in the winter,

keeping a horse, and consequently deprive them of the means of vi-
siting their parishioners, and even the sick, so frequently and re-
gularly as otherwise they would have done, and would all, it is
hoped, wish to do, when called to that important duty, at least, as
much as their time, strength, and personal safety will permit.
To remedy this inconvenience, by the minister's taking a farm, is
a plan, in the present state of this country, inexpedient, and al-
most impracticable.  To seek redress by a process of reduction, is at-
tended with certain expence, and often with much odium.
