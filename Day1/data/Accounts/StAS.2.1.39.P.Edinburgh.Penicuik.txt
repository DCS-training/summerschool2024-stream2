parish by the increase of the population. In the month of No-
vember 1835, the writer took up a new census, when he found no
more than 2286 souls,-which shows that the population has not
been much on the increase since 1831. Of this number, 1250
are resident in Penicuik or its immediate neighbourhood. The
following table exhibits the yearly average of birth, deaths, and
marriages for the seven years preceding Whitsunday 1831.

   The register of deaths may be presumed to be correct, be-
cause no interment could take place without registration. The
list of marriages may also be considered as pretty accurate,
but no reliance can be placed on that of births,-which may
be taken to exhibit only one-half of the actual number of births.
The Dissenters who amount to one-third of the whole popu-
lation, rarely, if ever, register the births of their children, and
many of the Established Church neglect it, notwithstanding all
that can be said to induce them to do so. Seventy births per an-
num, at an average, I should consider as a fair approximation, in
stead of 33, as the table would make it. There are 417 persons
underseven, and 97 above the age of seventy. Instances of individuals
reaching to the term of ninety are pretty frequent. I have seen a
reel danced in the neigbbourhood of Penicuik by four person,
whose united ages came to 320 years. There are at present 55
males above fifty years, who are unmarried, or are widowers, and
64 females above forty-five, who are unmarried. The total num-
ber of fimilies was 522 in 1835, the average number in each fa-
mily being 4 1/2. In the village of Penicuik it is however, under 4,
but in the landward part of the parish it is upwards of 5. Number
of inhabited houses, 500.
   The people are, in general, strong and healthy, but not so in
any remarkable degree. Insanity has prevailed more than might
have been expected. In the year 1830, two individuals committed
suicide under its influence, one of whom accomplished the death
