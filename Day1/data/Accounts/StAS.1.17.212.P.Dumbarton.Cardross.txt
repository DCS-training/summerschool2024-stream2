which fall in the harvest and winter months, the lands are
for a long time drenched in water, and, of course, rendered
much less valuable both to the proprietor and tenant.  No-
thing but draining can remove this inconvenience, and faci-
litate improvement; and as the proprietors are chiefly inte-
rested in this, their exertions, it is hoped, will every day be
more and more employed to promote to important an end.

   Cattle.-Formerly almost every farmer kept a few sheep;
but now, excepting on three farms, this practice is entirely
given over.  Too little attention, in general, is given to the
breed of milk cows.  It is also a practice too much follow-
ed, to overstock the ground; in consequence of which, the
growth of the cows is injured, and the produce of the dairy
diminished.  The breed of horses is greatly improved.  Their
price, in the Glasgow market, is from 15 l. to 30 l. Sterling.

   Farm Houses.-It must afford great pleasure to the traveller
to observe the neat farm houses, which are interspersed
through this country.  In this parish they are every year in-
creasing in number, a circumstance which does no small cre-
dit to the proprietors.  Sir ARCHIBALD EDMONSTON of
Duntreath, Bart, member of Parliament for Dunbarton shire,
in this, and, indeed, in every other parish where his exten-
five property lies, has furnished an example, which, it is hop-
ed, will soon be generally followed.  His tenants are all well
lodged, and, comparatively speaking, elegantly.  Instead of
the old low-built and confined houses, which their fathers in-
habited, Sir Archibald has given them houses and offices
suited to their respective farms, upon a plan, which conveys
an idea of neatness and improvement that is highly pleasing.
