road from the east end of the parish to the westmost dwel-
ling house in it.  The only place of access for wheel carriages
is at the east end; and, it is probable, this will always con-
tinue to be the case, the surrounding and steep hills, in every
other quarter, rendering it difficult to make a cart road to
Glenmuick, Glentamir, Navar or Clova; and the little in-
tercourse with these places rendering it unnecessary.  Many
of the tenants have also made private cart roads for their own

1764, there were no carts in the parish.  There are 3 stone
bridges, one upon Tarf, another over Mark, and the third
about a mile below the junction of Lee and Mark.  The 
above bridges were all built since 1749.

with peats; but as the mosses, in several places upon the
low ground, are nearly worn out, their fuel will be obtain-

in regard that the hills, although in many places covered
with inexhaustible moss, are, at present, inaccessible; and it
would require very considerable sums of money to make
even tolerable roads of communication.

tion in 1723, Lochlee and Lethnot made but one charge; the
minister resided at Lethnot, where he had a manse and glebe.
It appears by a decreet passed in 1717, that the stipend a-

munion elements.  During the above period, the minister
preached two days at Lethnot for one day at Lochlee, and
in tempestous seasons of the year, the inhabitants of Loch-
lee remained without public worship altogether.  As a re-
medy for this disadvantage, John Lindsay of Edzell, at that
time also proprietor of Lochlee, by a deed of mortification,
