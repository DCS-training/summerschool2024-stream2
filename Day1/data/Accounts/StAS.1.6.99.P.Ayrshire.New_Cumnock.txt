on the north side, which run into the water of Lugar at Cum-
nock.  There are several pikes found in this water; and a-
bundance of trouts in the river Aston, which takes its origin
in the south part of the parish, and runs into the Nith near
the church.  These rivers are not navigable.  The Nith, for 3
miles, runs in a straight wide plain with a small declivity;
which, in the opinion of some, was formerly a marsh: on
both sides of the stream in this plain there are fertile grounds
and meadows, but they are sometimes overflowed in speats.

   Minerals.-There are various mines of coal and lime, which
serve the neighbourhood; though little is consumed, owing
to the want of a navigable river; in which case, a greater estate
would arise from them than from the surface of the land
There is now a lead mine working in Aston barony, about 3
miles S. W. from the church, in which a company of Quakers
have entered into a contract.  Twenty miners are employed,
and more are expected according to the apparent success.  A
wodd mine was lately found on the estate of the Earl of Dum-
fries.

   Population.-According to the returns to Dr Webster in
1755, the number of souls was 1497; though, when the pre-
sent incumbent was settled, about 1757, the number was little
more than 1000.  It may now amount to about 1200, two
villages having been built near the church, and on Aston-wa-
ter, where there was but one house in 1757.  There may be
40 births, near as many deaths, and about 10 marriages, per
annum.  There may be 80 farmers and storekeepers, and
more cottagers, 200 men-servants, near as many women-ser-
vants, about 400 horses, near 1000 milch-cows and their fol-
lowers.  The number of sheep cannot be easily guessed at.
