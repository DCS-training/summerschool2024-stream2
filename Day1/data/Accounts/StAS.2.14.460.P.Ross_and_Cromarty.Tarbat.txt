                 PARISH OF TARBAT. *

        PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS.

          THE REV. D. CAMPBELL, MINISTER.


         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Boundaries, &c.-THE parish of Tarbat occupies the eastern
promontory of the shire of Ross, being bounded on the south and
east by the Murray Frith, and on the north by the Dornoch
Frith, and terminating in a narrow point called Tarbat Ness, on
which an elegant lighthouse has lately been built.
   From the want Of woods and enclosures, the parish presents
rather a naked appearance.
   Soil.-The soil is generally light, a great deal of it being sandy;
but a considerable proportion of most of the large farms is a deep
black loam, capable of bearing all ordinary farm produce; and
the lighter lands in rainy seasons also give good crops of turnips
and grass, from sea-ware, which the neighbouring shores, supply
in great abundance.
   A variety of caves occur along the shores of the parish-some
occupied for many months together by bands of tinkers.

                    II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Antiquities.-There is, above the village of Portmaholmack, a
green hill, called Chapel Hill, where there was discovered, on levelling
the ground for new buildings, a number of human bones
deposited within rough flags of freestone.
   There is a beautiful piece of masonic work in the churchyard,
called the Dingwalls' Tomb.
   On the north side of Tarbat Ness, at a creek called Port Chaistel,
are the ruins of an old castle, overhanging the sea, and cut off
from the land by a deep ditch; and beside it, on the Black Moor,
is the vestige of a Roman camp. Near the site of the lighthouse
is the foundation of a monument, built, it is said, by the Romans
as a land-mark.
