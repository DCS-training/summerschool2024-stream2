horses may be reckoned, from L. 15 to L. 20, or L. 25 each.
The price of cattle, when fattened, is generally from 5 s to
5 s 6 d. per stone, and milk cows about the fame.  Other
kinds of black cattle, are valued in proportion to the state they
are in, when purchased,-to their, age, and the particular pur-

clergyman, which number was 200.  In the year 1716, the
first presbyterian minister was settled : And there was, at the

any dues to him.  However, upon examining the list of
