     Of Crathy and Braemar.

parish of Braemar is supposed to be more elevated above
the level of the sea, and farther removed in every direc-
tion from the coast, than any other parish in Scotland.

   Climate, Soil, Produce, &c.- The climate is healthy,
and many of the inhabitants live to a good old age.  The
principal distempers are fevers, gravel, rheumatism, and
cholic.  When a malignant kind of the small pox prevails,
it carries away a number of children; yet the body of
the people are not reconciled to inoculation.  The soil is
various; in some parts a light loam, in others a thin
clay; but, in general, shallow and sandy; yet, when
properly cultivated, produces, in a favourable season,
good crops.  The ordinary crops raised by the country
people, are, oats, bear and potatoes.  Turnips and clover,
with rye grass, are cultivated by a few gentlemen.
There was very little lintseed, till of late, sown in these
parishes, although it was found to answer exceedingly
well, for this reason, that there was no lint-mill in the
county; but that grievance is now, in a great measure,
removed, as Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld has built a
lint-mill at Castletown of Braemar.  The consequence
is, that the people, in general, sow more lintseed; and
from the advantages they derive from this branch of
farming, it is probable that, in a few years hence, ano-
ther lint-mill, at least, will be necessary in this part of
the country*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As there is no map of the parishes, it is impossible to say what number of
acres are in tillage.  Oats are sown in April, or sooner, is the season permits,
then lintseed, and potatoes, and bear from the beginning to the middle of May.
The time of harvest is extremely variable; beginning sometimes about the 15th
of August, and sometimes not till the 1st or 5th of September.
