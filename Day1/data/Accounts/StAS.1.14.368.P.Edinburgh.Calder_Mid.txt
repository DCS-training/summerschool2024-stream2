     Statistical Account

of a Lord of Parliament, was conferred on Sir James;
for which he immediately paid 10,000 crowns, and be-
came bound that 500 merks should be paid annually to 
the fovereign, by him and those who should succeed him.
The title has remained in the family ever since; and
the present representative is the Right Honourable James
Sandilands Lord Torphichen.  This family have long
been respectable, not only for the rank in which they
are placed, but also for their decency of conduct, and
their attention to the duties of religion.
   Mr. John Spottiswood, of the family of that name in
Merse, was parson of Calder Comitis.  He resided here
chiefly, during the perilous times of the Reformation.
When the ferment subsided, he was chosen superintend-
ant. of the churches in Lothian, Merse, and  Teviotdale,
as the bishops had lost their power, and the Presbyte-
rian form of government, in its present state, was not
then established.  He discharged the duties connected
with his station, so as to merit respect and approbation*.
When he became old and infirm, his son John, at the
age of 18, succeeded him, as parson of Calder Comitis.
But he did not long continue in this situation; he was
made Archbishop of Glasgow, after the hierarchy of the
Church of England prevailed in Scotland, as it did for
a time; he was one of King James I. of England's Privy
Counsellors; crowned Charles the First in the chapel of
Holyroodhouse; and died Archbishop of St. Andrew's.
He was the same Spottiswood who wrote a History of
the Church of Scotland+.
