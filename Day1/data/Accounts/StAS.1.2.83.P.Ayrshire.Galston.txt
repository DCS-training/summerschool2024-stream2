poet of less powers and sensibility than Ramsay, with the
sentiments contained in that celebrated pastoral.-The high
multures formerly paid at these corn mills, are now, in a great
measure, bought up and abolished; though, in the lands of
Greenholm, and a few others, they still exist.-The only
services of a personal nature which remain, are, the common
mill services, of thatching the mill, dragging home the millstone,
etc. etc. and, on one estate, that of bringing home the mas-
ter's hay.-The people are in general long lived; many hav-
ing died within these few years between 70 and 100.-The con-
sumption is the most prevalent distemper, and the most fatal.
The small-pox makes frequent ravages; and incculation is not
so common as it ought to be.  The religious prejudice against
it is still great.  Of above 500 who have been inoculated in the
space of 12 years, not one has died.-It may be added,
that the inhabitants of Galston are, in general, sober, indus-
trious, and charitable to the distressed.  It is to be regretted,
however, that instead of the wholesome beverage of ale, they
are now compelled, by the high duties on that article, to be-
take themselves to the use of whisky, which is equally destruc-
tive to the health, and to the morals of the people.
