  Parochial Regiaters.-These consist of 19 folio volumes, the
first 6 of which contain registers of baptisms and marriages jointly,
and of the remaining 13, there are 9 of baptisms and 4 of mar-
riages, separately. With the exception of a blank in the mar-
riages from 1745 to 1750, they are continuous from 16th July
1561, the date of the first entry, to the present period. Where
the baptisms and marriages are recorded together, the latter are
on the margin. Some of the old volumes are beautifully written,
and the ink is black and still retains its shining quality.
  There is a register of deaths from 1617 to 1657, small quarto,
very distinctly and beautifully written. It was recovered by me
very lately from a person into whose hands it had shortly before
accidentally come. It had evidently been at one time in the pos-
session of one of my predecessors, but it had afterwards passed
from him to others not officially connected with the parish, and
seems to have been altogether lost sight of.
  A very accurate register of burials has been kept in a folio vo-
lume since 1833. The superintendent of the churchyard takes
charge of it.
  The kirk-session records consist of 11 folio volumes. The first
regular entry on them is dated the last day of June 1640. The
minutes for the first 45 years are very neatly and distinctly writ-
ten, apparently, too, in the same hand, but abound in contractions.
With the exception of a blank between 1689 and 1701, the vo-
lumes are continuous to the present period.
  All these registers and records are well bound, lettered, and
dated on the back, and in good preservation.
  Antiquities.*-King Malcolm Canmore's Tower.-All that now
remains of this ancient edifice is a connected angle, or fragment
of the south and west walls: the length of the former of which is
31, and of the latter, 44 feet. The south wall, in 1790, was 49 1/2

<FOOTNOTE> A full account of the antiquities is given in the writer's History of Dunferm-
line. Only a few can be here shortly noticed.
