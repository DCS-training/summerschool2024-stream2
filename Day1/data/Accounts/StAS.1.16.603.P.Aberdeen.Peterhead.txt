opiates, rather than irritate by tonics and stimulants.
   The mineral water is sometimes recommended for a sup-
pression of urine.  When this proceeds from great debility,
or a paralytic affection of the longitudinal fibres of the blad-
der, it may then be sometimes serviceable; but when
them is any suspicion of inflammation, or when it proceeds
from spasm, I should not think it safe to recommend the
water; and considering the difficulty of determining from
which of there causes the disorder may proceed, the utmost
caution is more necessary.
   Dr Laing has recommended it likewise for dropsy.  Of
the propriety of this I have great doubts.  There are many
diuretics prescribed in that disorder, which are certainly
more efficacious; and when tonics are indicated, they may
be given in a more concentrated form; when the disease
proceeds only from relaxation, perhaps no great danger is
to be apprehended from using the water; but when it pro-
ceeds, which is frequently the case, from obstructions in the
liver, I should be afraid to recommend it.  I would not

and deobstruent, and which has been so strongly recom-

cases, would be more proper for allaying thirst.
   It is really not possible precisely to ascertain what quan-

proper to use it freely.
   It is prudent to begin with small quantities, and increase
the dose as the stomach, or the strength of the person will
permit.  When the appetite is mended, and the water
passes off easily, the person need not he uneasy at thinking
he has taken too large a quantity.  I have known it drunk
