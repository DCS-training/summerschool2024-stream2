          Poor and Parochial Funds.-Previous to 1818, the poor of this
       parish was supported by alms, and collections at the church doors;
       but in that year, typhus fever was very fatal, and it having been
       ascertained that the disease was carried into many houses by beg-
       gars, moderate sums were raised, by voluntary subscription, for
       the purpose of serving the poor at one particular place, so as to
       stop the contagion ; but some of the heritors having subscribed
       inadequately, and others having withdrawn their subscriptions too
       soon, a legal assessment became necessary, which has since been
       continued.  During the first two years, the assessment was between
       L.300 and L.400, and few complained of it, not being more than
       was given in alms; but now it amounts to nearly L.1000.
