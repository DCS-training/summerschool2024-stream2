	About 40 acres imperial, now nearly unproductive. might be re-
claimed by judicious draining.
	On the above 280 acres of woodland, which, about eight years
ago, were estimated at about L.6000, a great deal of wood has since
been blown down by repeated storms, and not a little cut down by
thinning.
	The woods generally consist of pine and larch, several of which
las description have attained to a great size; the soil seeming
to be well adapted to them.
  Prices of different descriptions of Timber.-Pine per cubic foot,
10d.; larch, do. 1s.; spruce, do. 10d.; ash, do. 2s.; birch and
alder, about 10d. per foot; beech, 1s. do.; plane, 1s. 4d. do.;
elm, 3s. 6d. do. The woods are kept under good management,
but would probably suffer nothing by being still farther thinned.
  Rent.-The average of rent for arable land may run from L.1,
5s. to L.1, 15s. per imperial acre. Some of the best land may be
rated at fully L.3, 10s. per acre, while some of the inferior ground
will bring more than 10s. the imperial acre.
	In the course of this season, several pretty large farms belong-
ing to this estate, have been relet at nearly triple their former
rent; thus, one of thdm which formerly rented at L.80 Sterling,
and 16 bolls of oatmeal, is now let at L.300 Sterling per annum.
