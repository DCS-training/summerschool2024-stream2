   From a careful calculation of the number of males above eighteen
years of age, made in the year 1838, it was found that there were
1176 employed about the various print-works upon the water; out
of that number only 109 were members of the Mechanics' Insti-
tution, that is, about one-eleventh of the whole-the remainder
consisting of females and persons resident in the district.
  In this district there are three pretty large villages within a
mile of each other-namely, Boahill, Alexandria, and Renton,
the united population of which may amount to about 6000; out
of that number last year, the attendance was 170, being equal to
35.29 of the whole. During last session a -library of 160 volumes
has been procured in connection with the institution.
  Hitherto the institution has been much indebted to gratuitous.
lecturers, who, in all cases, have been left to choose their own
subjects, the consequence of which has been, that the courses of
instruction were more desultory and unconnected than the com-
mittee would have liked-an evil which they are endeavouring, as
far as possible, to obviate during the ensuing session.
