ring fishery in the frith of Forth.  Besides a great num-
ber of boats fitted out and manned by the fishermen and
others belonging to the town, several hundreds assembled
from different parts of the country, particularly from An-
gus, the Mearns and Aberdeenshire.  These were supplied
by the inhabitants with nets, for the use of which they re-
ceived a certain proportion of what was caught.  Immense
quantities of herrings were cured for home consumption,
and for exportation.  The Drave, as it is here called, was
seldom known to sail.  The fisherman expected it as cer-
tainly as the farmer did his crop.  Almost all the people
in the place derived their support from it, the other fishe-
ries, and the trade and manufactures which were immedi-
ately connected with them.  A sad change has now taken
place; and we liften as to a fairy tale, to the accounts gi-
ven by old people of what they remember themselves, or
have heard related by their fathers.  For half a century,
the fisheries here have been gradually declining.  The
herrings, for several years pad, have neither visited the
coast in any considerable quantity, nor remained long e-
nough upon it to spawn as formerly.  This is partly to be
ascribed to unfavourable weather; partly to the shoals be-
ing broken by the buss fishing upon the N. E. coast of
Scotland, which was not the cafe during the flourishing pe-
riod of the fishery here; partly to the encroachments of
our neighbours the Dutch, who occasionally sweep our
coast with a fleet of nets, extending several miles in length,
at no greater distance than 2 or 3 leagues from the shore;
and partly perhaps to the industry of man, having thinned
this species of fish.  This conjecture is not so vague, as
some at first fight may be apt to imagine.  In addition to
the havock made by the British and Dutch fishermen, im-
mense quantities have of late years been killed upon the
coasts of Sweden and Norway.  The herrings, crowding
