   Lime.-The manure made use of is lime, brought 12 and
14 miles distance; the price is 11 d. the Carlistle bushel, two
of which make one Linlithgow boll.

   Coal.-The coal, with which it is burnt, is brought from
England, which is the reason of the high price.  This coal,
when carried by water, is liable to a high duty.  There is no
coal on the whole coast of Galloway, Nithsdale, or Annan-
dale; they are mostly supplied with that article from Cum-
berland, on the other side of the Solway Frith.  It is to be
regretted, that the people who live at a great distance should,
after shipping and unloading, paying freight, and carrying it
many miles by land, after all be obliged to pay a heavy duty;
while the people who live at the coal-pit should pay nothing,
and at the same time all living under the same king, govern-
ment, and laws.  It is asserted, by those who know, that a
farthing on the cart load, at the coal-pit, which would be lit-
tle felt, and easier collected, would bring more money to go-
vernment than all this duty.  There have been frequent at-
tempts made to obtain some redress in this matter, but hi-
therto without success.  The fuel mostly made use of in this
part is peat.  The mosses are wearing out.  Coal that is used
for fuel and burning lime, is brought at 30 and 40 miles
distance by land; and notwithstanding of the long land car-
riage, there have been great improvements made, by break-
ing up moorish and wild lands, with the assistance of lime,
without which one cannot pretend to improve those kinds of
ground, to any profit or advantage.  The rich lands on the
banks of the rivers, may let for 20 s. to 25 s. per acre; the
uplands not so high.

   Farms.-The farms are generally very small; there is on-
