     of Sorn.

   Evern since the year 1757, when a small augmentation
was obtained, the annual stipend has consisted of 31 bolls
10 1/2 pecks of meal, 16 bolls 4 1/4 pecks of bear, and L. 44,
5 s. 7 1/4 d.  Sterling, including L. 3: 6: 8 for communion-
elements.  A considerable part of this stipend is paid by
the parishes of Mauchline and Tarbolton; and the whole is
paid in a number of trifling articles, a circumstance which
unavoidably occasions a good deal of expence and inconve-
nience to the incumbent.  William Tennent, Esq; of Sorn
is patron.

   School.-Exclusive of the school in Catrine, the parish-
school is the only regular and standing one; but the inhabi-
tants of the more remote districts occasionally unite, and
employ teachers for the instruction of their own children.
The parish schoolmaster has no garden, but he has a school
and dwelling-house, both among the most wretched that
are to be found in any cultivated country.  The late Mr
James Boswell of Auchinleck, the last time he was in this
country, declared his determination, to do every thing in his
power, in order to redress this parochial grievance as soon
as possible; but his death, which unfortunately happened
soon after, prevented his doing any thing in the business,
and it has not yet been taken up by any other person.  The
schoolmaster's salary is L. 8; 6; 8; and the school-fees are,
for reading 1 s. 8 d.; reading and writing, 2 s. 6 d.; writing
and arithmetic, 3 s. per quarter.  Latin is not taught here.
The average number of scholars is from 25 to 30, and the
schoolmaster's whole annual income, including his emolu-
ments as session-clerk, amounts to about L. 20.  The school
is by no means in a flourishing-state, and there is but little
probability of its ever being so, till better provision is made
for the master.
