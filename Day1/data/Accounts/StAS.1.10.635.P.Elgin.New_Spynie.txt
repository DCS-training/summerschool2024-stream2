     of Spynie.

   Population.-The population seems to have decreased in
the course of the last 30 years.  Although there are no ve-
ry large farms in the parish (there being only one that ex-
ceeds 100 acres), yet there are several, in which, within that
period, one tenant has succeeded to 405.  It is probable, that
the population may be still a little farther diminished, as
nearly one half of the parish consists of farms from 20 to
40 acres, which the proprietors may through time see pro-
per to lay out in larger tenements.

                                               -----

   Manufactures.-The only manufactory of this parish is
that erected by Mr John Ritchie, merchant in Elgin.  In the
eastmost part of this parish, on the river of Loffie, within a
half mile of the town of Elgin, he has built on a feu belong-
ing to him, a mill for the manufactory of tobacco, a waulk-
mill, a flax mill, and bleaching machinery, which has brought
to great perfection the bleaching of linens and thread; and
he is, with great affiduity, giving every hope of bringing these
useful and laudable inventions to perfection.

*These averages are taken from the parish register, from
1784 to 1790, inclusive, a period in which it appears to have
been very exactly kept.
