   Manures, etc.-The manure chiefly made use of is lime;
great quantities of which are imported from Whitehaven, in
the north of England, and still greater from Loch-Larne, in
the north of Ireland.  Considerable quantities of shells, which
are found not far from the surface, in several places of the
parish, are also used.  Another manure, much run upon at pre-
sent, is a soft sea land, either taken from within the flood-
mark, or dug in lands that have been formerly covered by the
sea.  This last manure is not thought to be so strong in qua-
lity as the former, but by spreading it a little thicker, it is
found to answer equally well; and is in great request, as it
costs nothing, but the labour of bringing and laying it on.
It has not yet been ascertained how long the virtue and effica-
cy of this manure will continue; but several have found the
good effects of it for four, five, six, and seven years; and
when the source whence it is taken in considered, we may ven-
ture to pronounce it an inexhaustible fund of wealth to the
district.
   The quantity of grain produced by means of these manures,
is very considerable, and increasing every year.  About twen-
ty years ago, it was thought a very extraordinary crop, is about
200 bolls of bear and oats, after reserving what was sufficient
for the maintenance of the inhabitants, could be exported.
But within these ten or twelve years past, the export has risen
from 200, to 400, to 600, to 800, to 1000, and in 1790, to 1200
Galloway bolls, each boll, containing twelve bushels, Win-
chester measure.  Nay, it is believed, by the most judicious
and intelligent farmers, that the quantity exported will go on
increasing for many years to come.  The grain is carried to
Ayr, Greenock, Glasgow, and other places on the Clyde.
These improvements in husbandry have also mended the
breed of cattle, the farmer being enabled by the greater quan-
tity, and the better quality of food to rear them in greater
