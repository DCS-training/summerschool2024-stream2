     of Lismore and Appin.

   Sea Coasts and Currents, etc.  There is a vast extent of sea-
coast in these parishes; perhaps from 80 to 90 miles in all
directions.  Where it lies contiguous, a great deal of sea-
weed is used for manuring the ground for barley and pota-
toes.  There is a violent current between the west end of
Lismore and Mull; well know to sea-faring people, at the
dangerous rock of Carrig, which is covered with the tide at
high water.  There are a number of smaller currents, though
not so deserving of notice.  There is a small, but strong one,
at the Ferry of Bailichelish, leading up to Lochleven and the
slate quarry.  There is a pretty strong one at the ferry be-
tween Lismore and Appin, and another at Shian Ferry, be-
tween Appin and Benderloch.  Between the west end of Lis-
more and Morvein three streams meet, in consequence of
contrary tides, which, in tempestous weather, occasion a
smart swell and broken seas.  All the above currents change
their courses regularly with the sides.  The best anchoring
about the island, for vessels of any burden, is in the narrow
found between Ramasa and Lismore, near the north point of
the island.  There is likewise very safe auchoring a little to
the west of Ramasa, in the Bay of Island Lochoscair, (Olcar's
Island), by Buchanan termed Molockascair, where vessels of
any burden can conveniently ride in a pretty safe road, and
free of any breakers.

   Mines, Quarries, etc.-Several appearances of lead mines
are to be found in Appin:  Only one of them was attempted to
be wrought, but it did not turn out to any advantage.  There
is some appearance of marble in Appin; but the slage quarry
of Bailichelish, at Laroch in Glenco, is the only quarry of this
nature in the parish that has turned out to any material ad-
vantage*.  There are a great number of hands at works

<FOOTNOTE>

*There are 74 families in the quarry, containing 322 souls.
