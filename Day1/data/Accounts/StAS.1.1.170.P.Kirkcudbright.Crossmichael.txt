     Statistical Account

Gordon of Culvennan, at his own expence, cut a canal to
connect the Dee with Carlinwark Loch.  Thus, boats carry-
ing from 10 to 24 cart load of marle each, passed up to New
Galloway, situated 15 miles from the loch.  Marle sold at
the loch at 1 s. per cart load; or 21 cubical feet was sold at
New Galloway at 1 s. 9 d.; and proportionally lower at other 
places by the way.  The canal is only on a small scale, and
at present out of repair.  The rocks at Tongland bridge, and
its shallowness between them and this place, prevent the Dee
from being navigable for 8 or 10 miles.  It might, however,
be connected with the sea at two places by a canal, by which
vessels might carry up the means of improvement to a coun-
try that wants them, and return with fuel to one in which
the want of this necessary article prevents the introduction of
manufactures.  An actual survey has lately been made; and, 
from the estimates of skillful engineers, it apppears that the
withed for communication might be opened for L. 9000.  A
curious fact has been ascertained by Mr Copland, viz. that
the rivers in this neighbourhood have considerably decreased
of late, and that the Urr did not discharge into the sea a
third part of the water it did 40 years ago.  Mr Copland thus
accounts for this striking phenomenon.  Land uncultivated,
and covered with heath, is almost impenetrable by water;
and, of course, the rain that falls must run off its surface into
the channels of the rivers.  This was the state of the land
here till it began to be improved by marle and lime.  The
application of these manures pulverises the ground, and
prepares it for absorbing the rain.  Besides, as it is well known
that water is a material part of the food of plants, less of it
will be left to flow into a river, when at least "four blades of
"grass, and four ears of corn, have been made to grow on
"its banks, where there was only one before."
