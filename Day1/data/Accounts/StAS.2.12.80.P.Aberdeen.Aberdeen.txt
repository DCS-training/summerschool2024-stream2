   Bridewell was erected at a cost of nearly L.12,000, and open-
ed in October1809.  It is situated in the centre of a square space
of ground, measuring nearly two Scotch acres, on the outskirts of
the town.  It contains 109 cells, each 8 feet by 7, with a height
of 7 feet 8 inches, besides two infirmaries and eight small sleeping
apartments adjoining.  It is warmed in winter by steam, and the
whole building is lighted by gas.  The governor's house and other
accommodations are in a building behind the prison, but attached
to it.  The officers employed are a governor, matron, two turn-
keys, a watchman, and a porter.  A chaplain, teacher, and surgeon,
also attend regularly.
   The male and female prisoners are kept in distinct parts of the
building.
   On the committal of a prisoner, he is stripped and bathed, dres-
sed in the prison uniform, and conducted to his cell; the regula-
tions are explained to him, and he is set to such work as he is con-
sidered to be capable of executing.
   Each prisoner is kept entirely separate from every other.  The
kinds of work in which the prisoners are employed are, weaving
linen and shoe girth, picking oakum, making door-mats, teasing,
carding, and spinning hair, picking and carding wool, shoemaking,
tailor-work, and blacksmith and carpenter-work.  A regular ac-
count is kept of the work done by each, and when his earnings ex-
ceed his maintenance, &c. one-third of the surplus is given to him
at liberation, one-third at the end of three months on producing a
certificate of his honesty and industry since dismissal, and the re-
mainder after other six months on a like certificate being produced.
   The amount of tho prisoners' earnings during the year from 1st
September 1837 was L.409, being the largest sum, in proportion
to the number of prisoners, realized in any prison in the kingdom
during a-year.  The hours of labour, are in summer from 5 A. M.
to 8 P.M., and in winter, from 6 A. M. to 8 P.M., with the neces-
sary intervals for diet.  The governor is empowered to punish for
disobedience, idleness, &c. by withholding a part of the allowance
of food, by confinement in a dark cell, by restricting the diet to
bread and water, or by putting in irons; but during the last year
