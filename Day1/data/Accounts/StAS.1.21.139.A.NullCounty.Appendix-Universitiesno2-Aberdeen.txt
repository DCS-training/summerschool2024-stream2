in making and recording a regular series of observations. It
would likewise be of very great service to the course of edu-
cation, that a separate professorship was established for the
study of rhetoric and the belles lettres; and in the theologi-
cal department, another for ecclesiastical history.
   An addition to the buildings of the College would also be
very useful, the present consisting of too few apartments,
and being otherwise incommodious.  For this purpose the
funds of the College are totally inadequate, being scarcely
sufficient to answer the expence of necessary repairs.  The
annual rum permitted to be appropriated to the use of the li-
brary is very small, and now that the price of books is so
much increased, will by no means admit of the purchased of
many valuable modern works.  Nor has the Marischal Col-
lege even the full benefit arising from the books entered in
Stationers hall, as only one copy being sent to Aberdeen, the
right of keeping them has been adjudged to the senior Uni-
versity, though they are declared to be the joint property of
both.  For the chemical class likewise, there being no pub-
lic fund for supplying utensils and instruments, all apparatus
is wanted, more complete and on a larger scale than the one
presently in use, furnished at the private expence of the pro-
fessor.
   Another improvement, which has been frequently propos-
ed, but from prejudice, the result of ancient custom, never
carried into effect, is the prolongation of the session of Col-
lege.  At present it continues only for five months, which,
besides being attended with other inconveniences, obliges the
professors to meet with the students no fewer than three
times a day, and to conduct and conclude their courses more
rapidly than would be necessary in a longer session.  This,
with almost any other deviation from former practice, can
only be made by the mutual consent of both Universities,
