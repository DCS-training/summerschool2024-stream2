southerly of these, and the highest, is called Maum Shou-
dhil.  This lake is constantly, both in summer and winter,
covered with ice; but in the middle of June, when the sum
is vertical, a very little of the ice in the centre of the lake is
dissoved.

   Climate.-In no respect has this country undergone a
greater change than as to climate.  About 20 years ago,
the farmers, without a coat upon them, were obliged to yoke
their labouring cattle, even in the month of March, about
three or four o'clock in the morning, as neither the plough-
man nor cattle could stand the heat of the day after six or se-

now, in the latter end of April, and beginning of May, than
a ploughman, with his body wrapt up in a great coat, and
his hands muffled in worsted mitts, to preserve him from the
frosty air.  Showers of snow and hail are not unusual in
June, not even in the dog-days; but though our seasons
have thus varied, we have upon the whole less frost and
snow throughout the year than formerly.

   Crops.-Otas, barley, pease, rye, and some wheat, are
the crops generally raised; but the parish, particularly the
Highland part of it, reaps more benfit from the culture of
potatoes than from all the other crops.  The great advan-
tage accruing to Highlanders from paying a proper attention
to the cultivation of this useful root, does not appear, per-

and convincing point of view than in the parish of Kilmo-
rack.  Within these 20 years, the Laird if Chisholm's te-
nants, in the height of Strathglass, were in the constant
practice of purchasing yearly oat-meal to the amount of
about L.500; but during the 12 or 14 years last past, they
have paid so much attention to their potatoe crop, that they
