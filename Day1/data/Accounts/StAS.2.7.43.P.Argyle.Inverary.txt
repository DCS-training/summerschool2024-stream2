                                  INVERARY.                     43

        Inns, &c.--The number of inns in the parish is two; of ale-
        houses and drain-shops, or shops licensed to sell spirits, &c., 12,
        all of which are in the burgh. Among these a great quantity of
        spirits is sold; and the following statement shows the amount of
        gallons sold, exclusive of wine, porter, ales, &c. in the last quarter
        of 1841 and the first quarter of 1843. These quarters may be
        considered as the maximum and minimum for these years.
           Number of gallons of spirits sold or taken out of stock in Inve-
        rary, from 5th October 1841 to 5th January 1842, and from 5th
        January to 5th April 1843:*-Last quarter of 1841, home spirits,
        2525 gallons; brandy, 46; foreign gin, 11; rum, 26; cordial,
        96; total for the quarter, 2704. First quarter of 1843, home
        spirits, 2156; brandy, 21; foreign gin, 5; rum, 15; total for the
        quarter, 2197. Total for a year, 9802 gallons.
           It is diffhcult to conceive how such a quantity of spirits is con-
        sumed, or whence the money comes for paying it; but it requires
        no exercise of credulity to believe that it cannot be used without
        much abuse of time, means, and understanding.
           Fuel.-The fuel used in the burgh is coal brought from Glas-
        gow, Ardrossan, and other places, and sold here at prices varying
        from 12s. 6d. to 15s. 6d. per ton of 24 cwt. In the rural districts
        coal is also used by the principal farmers and gentlemen; but turf
        or peat continues to be in general use.
