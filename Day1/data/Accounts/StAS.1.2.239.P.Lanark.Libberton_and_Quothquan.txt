ers included, and 28 bachelors.  Among the bachelors are in-
cluded all above 22 years of age.
   The number of inhabited houses, is exactly 168; which
makes the number of persons, at an average, to each inhabi-
ted house, to be nearly 4 1\2.

   Produce, etc.-The parish produces no vegetables, plants,
nor trees, but what are common in Scotland.  There is, in-
deed, very little planting in it.  Though the waste grounds
are well sitted for raising firs, and all kinds of hard wood,
yet there is no parish, in the upper ward of Clydesdale, where
less has been done to improve it in this way.-The number
of horses in the parish, amount to 219; black cattle to 790; the
sheep to 1149.
   There are upwards of 6000 acres in the parish.  Of these
there are about 3500 in tillage, viz. 100 employed in raising
barley,-30 in turnips and potatoes,-35 in flax-24 in sown,
or artificial grasses,-1188 in pasture,-2123 in oats.  All the
rest of the land may be called waste, being fit for nothing
but planting.-The parish supplies itself with all kinds of
provisions; and exports a considerable quantity of meal, butter,
cheese, and some horses and black cattle.
   This parish has many disadvantages.  From its high situa-
tion, it is much exposed to frost, which generally sets in very
early, and is very late in going away.  As it stands in the
centre between the east and west seas, it is likewise exposed to
the rains of both oceans, by which, the farmers often suffer in
harvest.  Another disadvantage arises from the want of shel-
ter.  There are few strips, or clumps of planting, to shelter
the cattle during the severity of winter.  The vast track of
waste land in the parish, which at present is not worth 6 d
an acre, might be turned to great account in that way, did
the landed proprietors attend to the interest of their families.
