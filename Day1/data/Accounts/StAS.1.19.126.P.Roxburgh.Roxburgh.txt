mented to the legal ultimum, viz. L. 100 Scotch, the school-
master's salary here, and I believe of all the schoolmasters
where he has any concern.  They are still but a poor in-
ducement for men of genius or learning, in this enterpri-
sing age, to undergo the drudgery of that most useful office.
At these humble seminaries, the million in this country re-

wisdom of our ancestors has constituted guardians of paro-
chial (schools) to recommend men every way fit for con-

Scottish people have derived such consequence, and on the
