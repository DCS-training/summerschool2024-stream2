	last our haill means, both horses, nolt, cloaths, corn, and merchant
	guids with our buiths, none whereof having been gotten removit,
	were all spolizit and away taken be James Graham, and his most
	cruel, unnatural, and merciless associates, in the month of March
	1645-our plenishing of timber all burnt, with some of the houses
