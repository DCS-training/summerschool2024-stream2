years ago, the wages of a labouring man-servant was from
L. 7 t L. 8; they are now (that is, in 1796) from L. 10 to
L. 12; of women servants, the yearly wages were then
from L. 3 to L. 3, 10 s.; they are now L. 4.  A tailor, when
maintained in the families of his employers, then earned
8 d. per day; he now earns 1 s.  A labourer then earned
10 d. a-day in winter, and 1 s. in summer; he now earns
15 d. or 16 d. a-day in winter, and 18 d. or 20 d. in sum-
mer.

   state of Agriculture.-Agriculture is here still in a very
imperfect, but, at the same time, in a progressive state.  Few
of the tenants possess more than a ploughgate of land, but
a considerable number of them possess much less.  The
leases are usually for 18 or 19 years, with some restrictions
as to management.  With respect to the rotation of crops,
the general rules prescribed are, that only one-third of the
farm is to be ploughed at a time; the two first crops to be
oats, the third bear and grass-seeds, the fourth hay, and the
next five years pasture; or, instead of this, the third
crop may be pease, the fourth bear and grass-seeds, etc.
From the want of proper subdivisions, however, and the
absence or inattention of the proprietors, these rules are sel-
dom strictly observed.  Instead of bear and grass-seeds the
third year, it is but too common a practice to take a third
and even a fourth crop of oats, and then to leave the lands
for pasture, without sowing any grass-seeds at all.

   Within the last 10 or 12 years most of the farm-houses
have been rebuilt, with considerable improvements, both in
point of size and accommodation.  Several of the pendicles
have been thrown into the adjacent farms, and about a do-
zen of cot-houses have been allowed to fall into ruins, their
inhabitants having repaired to the villages, (which have late-
