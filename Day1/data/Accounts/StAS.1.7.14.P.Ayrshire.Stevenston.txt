cuts them, but has the happy effect of keeping off the great
waste of water on the west fide of its from 

   2.  The second centre division of the coal-field, by much
the largest which is wrought at present.  This is bounded
on the east by the Piper-heugh gall, a dyke small and thin
compared with the former, and the metal or substance of it
soft.  It is what the miners call a bitch, i.e. it disturbs all
the strata of coal, of stone, and every thing else in its neigh-
bourhood, so as to make them start suddenly about ten or
twelve fathoms out of their former inclined plain:  But they
immediately go on again in a similar declivity, at their regu-
lar or parallel distances.  In this division there is said to be
an extent of a field of coal about 2000 yards on the level of
the dip engine pit, viz. at 54 fathoms, and all clear to the
rise of this.

   3.  The third or east division reaches from the Piper-heugh-
step to another, called the Milldam-step, and gives them an ex-
tent of level of about 1500 yards.  Here the coal, instead of its
usual dip of one fathom in five, dips one in ten.  The second
third seams become also so thin as to be worth nothing.
And the whole coal, when it approaches towards the last
named Milldam-step, becomes very much troubled, and turns
into what they call humph, a black useless substance.  In all
probability it continues in the same state to the east, as seve-
ral unsuccessful trials have been made in the parish of Kil-
winning and on the Muir of Irvine, on the level of the Ste-
venston coal, and not a little money sunk in there experi-
ments.
