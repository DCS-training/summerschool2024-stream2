     Statistical Account

   In the lower parts of the parish, the improvement of arable
land has of late years been principally carried on by lime, which
turns out to exceeding good account.  There is great plenty of good
limestone; but coals lie at the distance of fourteen miles.

   Antiquities.-There are several remains of ancient buildings
in this parish.  The castles of Carleton, Knockdaw, Kirkhill,
Craigneil, Pinwhirry, Kildonan, etc. and also a number of 
cairns, or large heaps of stones in different places, which are
certainly antient enough; but for what purpose they were col-
lected, is not certainly known.

   Heritors-There are seventeen proprietors of land, only
two of whom reside in the parish.

   Manufactures.-A tan-work set up about a twelve-
month ago; it is at present on a small scale, but will probably
be enlarged.-An woolen manufacture would be the most
proper one for this part of the country.-There are in the
parish 24 weavers, 7 of whom reside in the village; 13 shoe-
makers, 13 taylors, 7 wrights, 10 masons, 5 blacksmiths, 5
millers, and 2 clothiers, all employed in working for the neigh-
bourhood.  There are also 5 corn mills, barley mill, and 2
lint mill.

   Church, etc.-An inscription upon a stone above the old
church door bears date 1591.  The church was taken down
and built new from the foundation in 1772.  It is in good re-
pair; but not being in a centrical situation, it has been cus-
tomary for the minister of Colmonell once a month to perform
divine service at a place called Barrhill, five miles distant from
it.  The manse was built in 1762; and has since been re-
paired. The stipend amounts to 99 bolls, I sirlot of victual,
