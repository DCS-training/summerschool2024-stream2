always presents at the termination opposite to its entrance some
hilly or rocky barrier, rendering egress in that direction either
difficult, or, in the a parent aspect of the scene, impracticable
Of the five valleys or glens now referred to, as embraced within
this parochial territory, the most important by far, in point of ex-
tent, diversified appearance, and relative position, is the valley
of the Bachai .q, so denominated- from the river Eachaig, to be af-.
terwards mentioned. This valley is formed by the -.pace between
the second and third of the mountain ranges already described.
Commencing at the inland extremity of the Holy Loch, and bound-
ed at its commencement there on the western side by the fourth
mountain range mentioned, and on the other side bv the second,
the Kilmun Hill, and presenting here an expanse of nearly two
miles in breadth, it stretches till it reaches Loeb Eck, a dis-
tance of about four miles, and narrowing as it approaches that
lake. Loeb Eck forms its continuation for seven miles or upwards,
when the same valley, continuing its progress in a north-western
direction, pretty uniformly, from the inland extremity of the Holy
Loeb, strikes into Loch Fine at Stracbtir Park, in the parish of
Strachur, and at,-tn angle somewhat acute, and on the Cowal side
of Loch Fine, about five miles nearer the entrance of that arm of
the sea than the town of Iliveraray. Thus viewed, the valley of
the Eachaig, with its continuation along Loch Eck and Strachur,
forms a leading and very interesting feature in the topography of
the district of Cowal. Its summit level, shewn by Loch Eck, is
not more than about 18 feet above the level of the sea ; and, while
geological phenomena indicate sufficiently, that at some remote
and unknown period the sea flowed along the whole of this valley,
forming the portions of Cowal to the westward of it into an island,
it may be of more importance practically, and in a commercial
age, to hint that this valley presents by far the shortest, easiest,
and most agreeable line of bommunication between Inveraray, the
county town of Argylesbire, and the southern parts of Scotland,
the distance between Kilmun and Loch Fine at Stracbur not ex-
ceeding thirteen miles, along a level far from bein- impracticable
to the genius of the railwayengineer. From the inland extremity
of the Holy Loch to the southern end of Loch Eck, a diitance
of about four miles, this valley presents avery considerable space
of level surface, ranging between the mountain groups that bound
it on each side, a space which, were adequate means employed
to straighten and embank the course of the river Eachaig, flowing
from Loch Eck till it falls into the Holy Loch, the valley might
present, in this portion of its extent, a scene of no ordinary land-
