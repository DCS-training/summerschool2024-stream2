The rise of farms for some years past has been considerable.
This is partly owing to the odious practice of one farmer
subsetting to another.  There are lands in the barony of

prietors of land, speedily abolish sub-sets and led farms; the
poor will bless you, and posterity unborn will rise up and
proclaim your patriotic virtues!
