     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   CORTACHY, or Quartachy, is derived from the Gaelic
word chuartaich, which signifies enclosed or surrounded.
The name is descriptive of its local situation, as it lies in a
small valley, surrounded by rising ground.  The origin of
the name CLOVA is uncertain.  There united parishes lie
on the north side of the county of Angus.  The river Pro-
sen separates them from the parishes of Kingoldrum and Kir-
riemuir, on the S. and S. W.  The parish of Cortachy, from
the extreme part on the south to its northern boundary on
the Grampian hills is about 13 miles in length.  Its breadth
varies.  The north and middle parts are about 8 miles
broad.  Towards the south end, its breadth does not exceed
two miles.  The parish of Clova is situated on the north.
west of Cortachy, and forms part of the Grampian moun-
tains.  It is about 10 miles long, from E. to W. and 7
broad.  There is no map of the parish; nor has the num-
ber of acres been ascertained.
