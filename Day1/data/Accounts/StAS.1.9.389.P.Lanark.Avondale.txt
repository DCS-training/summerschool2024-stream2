is superior of all the lands in the parish, excepting a very
small portion of temple land, which is held of Lord Tor-

for a chapel of ease.  A decent house was accordingly built,
and conveniently fitted up in 1776.  While the house was
building, several ministers of the presbytery of Relief came
and preached at a tent, with whose eloquence the people
