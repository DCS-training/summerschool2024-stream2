servative and Liberal parties each support a reading-room in Dum-
barton.
   Friendly Societies.-There are four Friendly Societies in the
parish, which were instituted for the purpose of assisting the mem-
bers in time of distress.  All members contributing regularly to
these societies are entitled to a weekly allowance when unable to
work. There is also a Society for the relief of indigent old men
and women, which has already done much good.

receiving parochial aid, is about 70. The amount of collections
at the church door, each Sunday, is generally about L. I.' The
proprietors in the parish are assessed for the support of the poor,
but only within the last four years. The average amount of the
assessment is about L. 300 Sterling. The amount of extraordinary
collections in the parish church during the last two years was as
follows: in 1837, L. 82, 17s. 9d., and in 1838, L. 59, Os. 6d.

   Fairs.-There is only one fair held within the parish. It is
held annually on the second Tuesday of August, on a common,

which are well filled, in summer, by travellers going to, and return-

ed is from 40 to 50.
   Fuel.--Coal is almost the only fuel used, and is all brought from
Glasgow.  A small quantity of peats is used by the poor.
