   Libraries.-Tbere are two libraries at Fort William, one literary,
the other religious; but no great demand for books from either
of them. There is a good selection of books in each of them,
but the frequent changes and vacancies in the mission of Fort
William is against the taste for reading religious books; and the
numerous spirit-shops in that village, and in other parts of the parish,
prove a great snare to those who ought to employ their time
in reading.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of poor may
be about 160, chiefly supported by collections at the church door,
with occasional donations from heritors, and alms received by their
going from house to house through the parish. The most needy receive
ls. per week; but the average given to ordinary paupers
may be from 5s. to 7s. in the year. The people are very kind
to such as are in distress. They send potatoes, milk, peats, &c. to
their houses. Some are very anxious to get upon the poors' list;
but others abstain from applying for aid as long as possible.
   Prison.-There is no prison in this parish. The garrison of
Fort William is used as a place of temporary confinement till the
accused be liberated or sent to Inverness or to Inverary jail.
   Fairs.-There are two annual fairs at Fort William, one about
the 13th of June, the other about the 13th of November,-both
well attended, and considerable business transacted at each.
   Inns.-There are three inns in the parish; and dram-houses
without number,-some of them licensed to sell spirits, some selling
without license.
