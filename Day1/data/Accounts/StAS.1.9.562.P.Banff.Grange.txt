no subtenants.  The lime-trade, which, for centuries back, has been the
principal employment of all the inhabitants, was incompatible with large
farms.  The largest farm formerly did not exceed 15 or 20 bolls sowing;
and every farm was skirted with a number of subtenants, who were
bound to assists their masters, in spring and harvest, with their services,
which was generally the greater part of the rent they paid for their pos-
sessions; and they were allowed to keep as many cattle and sheep upon
the common pasture as they pleased; and each district of the parish had
a large tract of pasture in common Whenever the seed time was over,
all hands were employed till harvest, and even after harvest was over, in
providing fuel, and in burning and driving lime; and before lime was
brought by sea from England, and the frith of Forth, Stryla supplied al-
most all Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, and Moray, with lime; for which
they received, as long ago as can be remembered by the oldest people, nearly
the same price as they do now.  They had also a kind of short flax, which
is now entirely banished out of the country, but of which they formerly
raised great quantities; the drying, breaking, scutching, beating, heckling,
spinning, weaving, and bleaching of which, not only afforded employ-
ment to men and women, at certain times of the year, when they could
not work at the lime trade; but brought in a great deal of money in
those days, and Keith market was formerly resorted to from all parts of
Scotland for purchasing linen-cloth.  This, together with the low rents
which they paid, the cheapness of visual, for which there was no market
but among themselves, and the numbers of black cattle and sheep which
the then extensive pastures enabled them to keep, (many of which they
fattened and killed for their own use, because them was no demand for
them at that time from the south country or from England), enabled
them to live comfortably, and bring up numerous families; and young
people were not deterred from entering early in life into the married
state from fears of want.  A very small stock was sufficient to begin the
world, and that stock was easily required.  But when shipping and trade
became more common upon the coast, and the exportation of corn com-
menced at Portsoy, then the farmers thought they could make more pro-
fit by the sale of corn, than by the lime-trade, or by subtenants; they
therefore enlarged their farms, by removing their subtenants.  The he
ritors also extended the corn-land, by dividing the commons, and setting
