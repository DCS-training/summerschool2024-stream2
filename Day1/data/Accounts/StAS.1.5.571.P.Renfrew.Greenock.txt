   The number of the heads of families, as was noted in ta-
king the above account, born in Argyleshire, among whom
the prevailing name is Campbell, is 1433; in the shire of
Bute 78, and in the northern counties 314; so that there
are in the two parishes of Greenock 1825 heads of families,
from the Highlands of Scotland.

<FOOTNOTE>

*In this number are not included the people on board coasting vessels,
the amount of whom, at a very moderate computation, will make it up
15,000.
