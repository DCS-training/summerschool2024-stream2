formed for the people resident on it by the ministers of Auchter-
house.
	Education.--The parochial school-house was erected in 1789,
and has been frequently repaired since that time, and is a well-
lighted and well-furnished teaching-room. The schoolmaster's sa-
lary is L.34, 4s. 4 1/2d. subject during the present teacher's time to
a deduction for payment of a precentor; his dwelling-house is com-
modious, and his garden not less than the legal extent. His fees
amount to about L.20 per annum. The schoolmaster is session-
clerk, and receives L.2 of salary and L.2, 6s. 8d. of perquisites for
the duties of that office. Besides the parochial school there is
another in the parish. The school-house of this school is paid for
by subscription, and the schoolmaster receives the school-fees,
amounting to L.20, in remuneration of his services.
	Poor.--The capital of the poor's fund amounts to L.440, and
is formed entirely of savings of collections, and of interest of capi-
tal, and of small sums obtained for the use of the mortcloth, and
by the letting of a few seats in the aisle of the church. Bank in-
terest is obtained for L.300, and 4 per cent. for L.140. The ave-
rage of weekly collections is 4s. 6d. The highest sum given to a
pauper is 16s. the lowest 5s. per month; and there are, at pre-
sent, eight paupers on the roll, besides a lunatic patient for whom
6d. per day is paid. For a provision for these, small as that pro-
vision is, large draughts, in addition to the weekly collections and
contingencies, must be frequently made on the capital of the fund,
by which, in the course of a few years, it must be exhausted, and
then there will be no alternative for the support of the poor but the
imposition of an assessment, which never fails of extinguishing be-
nevolence on the part of the giver, and gratitude on the part of the
receiver.
