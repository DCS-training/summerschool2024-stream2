was repaired and somewhat improved in 1809.  An addition was
made to it in 1815, but it is still too small, both as to the number,
and yet more as to the size of the apartments.
   The low glebe of Stow consists of within half a rood of seven
acres imperial, of which five acres and three roods are under the
plough.  The rest is occupied by the garden, site of manse, &c.,
and a bank east of the garden, &c.  There is also what is called
the high or hill glebe, consisting of a part of what was anciently
common, and of which, when ultimately divided in 1756, a portion
was allocated to the minister in lieu of certain rights of pasturage
formerly enjoyed.
   The improvements on the hill glebe may have cost me about
L. 300, and I consider it at present worth L.20 a year.
   The stipend of Stow previously to 1693 was L.400 Scots and
two chalders of victual.  At that time L.350, 6s. 2d. Scots were
added to it.  In 1780, it was raised to L.840 Scots and two chal-
ders meal and one bear.  In 1806, it was again augmented to
seven chalders, one-third barley and the rest meal, with L.900
Scots (L.75 Sterling) including L.8, 6s. 8d.  Sterling for commu-
nion elements, and finally, the Court, of Teinds (20th November
1822) modified the stipend of Stow to sixteen chalders, one-half
meal and the other half barley, payable at the highest fiar prices,
with L,8, 6s. 8d.  Sterling for communion elements.  Three heritors,
the proprietors of Crookston, of Michelston, and of Newhall, have
surrendered their teinds, but there still remain funds for an aug-
mentation.
   A meeting-house was set down in the village of Stow, soon after
the Secession from the Church a century ago.  It belongs to what
is now called the United Secession Church.
   The number of families and individuals attending the Establish-
ed Church cannot be very accurately ascertained as there is no
letting of seats.  The number of communicants has exhibited, a
progressive increase from 1808, when I first dispensed the Lord's
Supper here.  Including ministers and elders it was then 230; in
1818 it was 314; in 1821, it was 340; and in 1880 and 1831,
it was 370: and in 1833, it was 374.  In 1835, the actual com-
municants reached 400.  It is obviously proper to distinguis ac-
tual communicants from those in the parish who are entitled to
the privilege, as not a few of these last must, on every occasion of
dispensing this holy ordinance, be prevented by ill health and
other causes from attending.
