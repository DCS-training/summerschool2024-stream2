young people leave us, to go to the neighbouring towns of
Dundee and Perth, to learn handicraft trades.-There is
only one ale-house.-It has been reported, that in a part of
the parish of Leuchars, near this, there were a race of Da-
nish shepherds, who kept their sheep as well as themselves
in their original state, and produced wool not inferior to
that of Shetland; but I am informed, that the people do
not keep themselves separate, but intermarry in the neigh-
bourhood; and as to their wool, I do not bear that it is
praised.  Their sheep are of a small size, and feed on coarse
grass or bent.  When other sheep sell at 14 s. or 16 s. these
people are glad to get 6 s. or 7 s. for theirs.
