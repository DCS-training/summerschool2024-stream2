     Situation, Extent, etc.

county of Roxburgh, in the presbytery of Jedburgh, and sy-

to South, upwards of four miles, and in breadth from East to
West between two and three.  It is bounded by the parish
of Jedburgh on the East, by Abbotrule (now annexed to Hob-
kirk and Southdean, but formerly a pendicle of Bedrule) on
the South, by Hobkirk and Cavers, from which it is, for the
most part, divided by the Rule on the West; and by Minto

is separated by the Tiviot.  It is somewhat of an oval figure,

pasture, and muir-land.  The soil is, in general, as good as
is to be met with in most grounds of the above description:
