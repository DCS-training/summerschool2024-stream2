     Of Wigton.

   School.-There is a good grammar school in the town of
Wigton, which is conducted by a rector and an assistant.
The emoluments, consisting of salary and wages, amount
to about 60 L. Sterling a year.  The salary itself is 30 L.,
of which 24 L. are paid by the town, and the rest by the
heritors.  The number of scholars is from 60 to 100, who
are taught Latin and Greek, English and writing, arith-
metick and book-keeping.  All children, even those of the
poorest people, are instructed in reading English, in writ-

   Fuel.-The principal disadvantage under which this part
of the country labours, and the great bar to the introduc-
tion of manufactures, is the want of coal.  The common
people, both in the town and country, burn peat, of which
indeed there is abundance within this parish.  The better
sort of inhabitants in the town, though they also use peat
in their kitchens, burn coal in their rooms.  It is brought
from the opposite coast of England, especially from White-
haven and Liverpool; the ton, which contains 32 Win-
chester bushels, cost lately a guinea at the port of Wig-
ton; but, by the late act of parliament, which took off
the duty, the price of the ton has been reduced to 15 s.
or 16 s.

   Manufactures.-In the town of Wigton, as in almost all
the other towns of Galloway, there has long been a want
of industry.  Something of a manufacturing spirit, how-
ever, having lately arisen in this part of the country, two
small manufactures, the one of wool and the other of cot-
ton, were introduced into this town, about a year and a
half ago.  In the former of these, which employs between
30 anti 40 persons, the wool is manufactured into plaiding
