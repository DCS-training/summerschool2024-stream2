famous:-A proof that the case is rare.-During twenty two
years ministry in a pretty numerous parish, where the poor are
maintained by taxation, I have known only one instance of
children refusing to assist their parents; they forfeited the esteem
of their neighbours, and banished themselves to America.  Af-
fection, both parental and filial, is chilled by want: the hind
calveth, and forsaketh her calf, because there is no grass: Under
the pressure of poverty, a mother may forget her sucking child

and probably never will extinguish it.  A spirit of independence
pervades the people; they feel the humiliation of receiving alms;
they discern the difference betwixt having of their own, and trust-
ing to what is given.  The poor law is an insurance against un-
foreseen misfortune, and removes that anxious solicitude about
what they shall eat and drink and put on, which the gospel has
