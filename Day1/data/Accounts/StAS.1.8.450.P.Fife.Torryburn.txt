     Statistical Account

May, turnips in June, and wheat in the months of September
and October.  In early seasons, the harvest commences about
the middle of August; in late ones, about the beginning of
September; and the crops are generally got in by the end of
October.-In the year 1782, the fields were not entirely clear
before the middle of November.

   Climate and Diseases.-The situation of Torryburn is healthy
and pleasant, and the inhabitants live to a considerable age.
There are several persons to be found at present above 80.
There are no diseases in the parish which can be called ende-
mial, or peculiar to the people.  They are sometimes afflicted
with fevers, but these seldom prove mortal.

   Coals, &c.-In the lands of Torry, the property of Sir
William Erskine, there are many different seams of coal, of
various qualities and thickness.  Great fields of these coals
are still to work, (particularly the main coal of Torry, which
is of the best quality), but they are all under level.  The lands
of Crombie were found to contain 6 seams of coal, of a quality
much the same with that of the Newcastle, and, like it, turn-
ed out small.  The seams above the level are wrought out.
Parts of the others still remain, but cannot be wrought but
with the assistance of a powerful engine.  The following table
of the thickness of the various seams of coal, in both estates,
was furnished by a gentleman, who was proprietor of the one,
and had a lease of the other.
