appear, as far as we can discover, to be of the same origin.
Thus Ferry-hill, Froster-hill, (the word Froster probably
corrupted from Forrester), Hilton, Robslaw, King's-wells,
Countess'-wells, Whitemires.  Some are more obscure in
their origin, as Pitmuckston, Rodrieston,Torry, Futtie, etc.
Of this last it was observed, that some resolve it into Foot-
Dee, the foot of Dee.  But this is directly contrary to the
common rule of analogy in the derivation of words.  When
any thing is expressed by one word in our language, (and
this holds in both dialects, English and Scotch), represent-
ing it as a part or member of some other thing, that other
thing makes the first part of the compound name, and the
part or member makes invariably the last part.  Thus the
mouth of the Wey is Weymouth, not Mouthwey; and that
the Scotch, in this formation of words, is the same with
the English, appears from some names of places in this
neighbourhood.  Thus we have Loanhead, not Headloan,
for the head of the loan or loaning; Craiglug, not Lugcraig,
for the lug, that is, the ear of the craig.  If, therefore,
they mean to call the place the foot of the river, it would
have been unquestionably Deefoot, not Foot-Dee.  But we
are not even certain that the month of a river is either in
Scotch or English ever called the foot.

     Ecclesiastical State of Aberdeen.
   The two principal churches of this city, which at pre-
sent are called the East and West, were formerly called the
Old and New Churches.  The church which stood where
the West Church now stands was called the Old, and is sup-
posed (though upon what evidence is not certain) to have
been several centuries older than the other.  The stile of
architecture, though both were Gothic, was very different
from that of the East (formerly called the New) Church,
still standing, and which likewise is of an uncertain date.
