branch of busines which they still preserve; though they 
are far from possessing the monopoly of greens and garden
stuffs, which they had in more ancient times.  The demand 
for vegetables has increased ten-fold within these 50 years, 
and horticulture has been so much encouraged in richer foils 
near the capital, that all the superiority that the gardeners 
here can now pretend to, is to furnish the earliest crops of 
pease and beans, ec. for a week or two, as the markets are 
soon filled from the more luxuriant garden grounds nearer
the city.  Connoiffeurs in that sort of viand, however, still

Baron Dillon, (page 174) are even superior in strength and activity to 
those of Fisherrow.  'In other countries,' says he, * women are oppressed 
wth the fligbtest fatique; here they work as much as the strongest men; 
unload ships, carry burdens, and do all the businest of porters.  The very 
felons, confined in the mines of Almaden, do nothing in comparison of these 
females.  They go barefootes, and are remarkably active, carrying burdens
