but it is money falling in value which is the real cause of the
difference, both of receipt and expenditure.  The high rents
likewise may appear extraordinary to out neighbours in
England, particularly; but it must be considered, that the
Scotch acre is 1-5th larger than the English, and the Scotch
farmer literally pays nothing but his rent.  All taxes, both
King's and parochial, minister's stipend, and every kind of
public burden, is paid by the heritor.

   Practical Agricultural Remarks.-Although fallow be
the most approved method, and generally thought to be the
best preparation for wheat upon clay, yet many very judi-
cious farmers seem to think that lint and clover are prefer-
able upon loam; only it is certainly extremely proper to
observe the same rule, of never sowing two white crops in
succession.  If this be the practice, a cleaning crop of pota-
toes, yams, drilled beans, or turnip, will always be neces-
sary to make one of the rotations.
   All roots are certainly scourging crops, and exhaust the
ground; and although the practice be pretty general to take
wheat after potatoes, it is perhaps not the best farming; at
any rate, it is not to be depended on in this country; for in
rainy autumns, there is such a risk of poaching the ground
in taking them up, and in dunging the land afterwards, as
to make it totally unfit for a wheat-feed.  However, if the
season be favourable, and the ground in good heart, it may
do very well.  Even very tolerable wheat crops have been
got after turnip.
   There are many farmers in the Carse now, who pay
little regard to the usual rotation of fixes.  It is true, they
still divide their farm into fixes; but they make wheat
after fallow, and after every green crop; in short, they
borrow from their oats and from their barley, till they have
