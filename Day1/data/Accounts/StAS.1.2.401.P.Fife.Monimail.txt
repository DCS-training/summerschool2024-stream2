dowers, who are heads of families, and single women, in hou-

   There are three corn mills, and one line-mill, driven by
water.  Two threshing-mills; one driven by horses, one by
water.  5 samll retail shops.  There is no occasion for any
lawyer, attorney, physician, or surgeon, in this parish, as
the town of Cupar supplies it environs, with legal and medical
aid.

   Agriculture.-The mode of managing lands is the same that
obtains in the low country in general: conflicting of rotations
of crops, hay, turnips, inclosing, and draining.  The face of the
parish is considerably changed of lat, and improvements are still
going forward.  The productions are the same with those of the
rest of Fife and the Lothians.  Considerable quantities of wheat
and barley are annually exported, or otherwise sent away.  The
raising of black cattle is now more attended to, than formerly.
Of 8 small flocks of sheep, 3 have been very lately sold off,
chiefly because sheep injure hedges and sown grass, and be-
cause it is said, that more profit is reaped from black cattle.
There are 5 farms above L. 100 sterling, (one of them L. 300:)
the rest from L. 70 downwards.  One pretty extensive farm
rents at L. 1:10s per acre.  The average rent of good farms is 
below L. 1 per acre.  Land of inferior quality is proportional-
ly lower, 15s. 10s. etc. etc.  Any estates, which have been
lately sold in this parish, and indeed in the neighbourhood,
have brought high prices.-Farm houses are now built more
commodious and comfortable.  The renantry improve body of
manners, dress, way of life, and form a respectable body of
men.-The ploughs are 76 in number, made on diff-
rent models: and new improvements are attended to, and tri-
ed, as they are suggested.
