     Statistical Account

   Sheep, Commerce, etc.-When sheep abounded here, the
pasture, which for a great part of the year was common, was
so overflocked, and so little food afforded them in time of
snow, that many hundreds died in a severe season; and those
that survived were of final size and value.  When so little
attention was paid to them, the profits of a flock must have
been small and uncertain, which, with the expence of winter
herding, when turnips and sown grass were introduced, may
be assigned as the principal causes, why their number is so
greatly diminished.  Where they still retain their ground,
the breed is improved both as to size and quality of wool.
The articles Which bring in money, are grain, cattle, butter,
cheese, and linen yarn.  Of these, cattle, in the opinion of the
most judicious farmers, is the staple commodity.

   Roads and Fuel.-The public roads are made and repaired
by the statute labour, which the people perform with reluc-
tance, and often in a superficial manner.  The post road from
Banff to Turriff is well supplied with bridges, and has of late
been much improved; but on this, as well as on many pri-
vate roads, much remains to be done.  It is the general opi-
nion, that assessments in money, or the introduction of turn-
pikes, are the only effectual way of making and keeping the
roads in good repair, as the experience of many years shews
the statute labour to be inadequate to that purpose.-Peats,
turf, and broom, are used for fuel.  Wet seasons, of which
we have had many of late, together with the great expence
of preparing and bringing home peats, induced many to burn
English coal, even before the late reduction of duty on that
necessary of life took place,

   Character of the People.-The people are sober and indus-
trious, submissive to the laws, and attached to their respec-
