1722, and has been twice repaired.  The manse was built a-
bout 10 years ago, and is in good order.  The stipend, 70 L.
16 s. 5 10/12 d. in money, is paid by 7 heritors; 3 of whom re-
side in the parish.  A process for augmentation is at present
depending.  The glebe consists of about 24 acres, but from
the nature of the climate, it is not very productive.  One
year with another, it may be worth about 13 L. Sterling.-The
poor, before 1773, were supplied from the weekly collections
at the church, and the charity of the inhabitants.  But these
being found to be inadequate, the heritors, at Martinmas
1773, agreed to supply the deficiency.  On the 6th of Ja-
nuary 1774, they assessed themselves in the sum of 36 L. a-
year, to begin at Martinmas preceding, and paid quarterly,
the one half by themselves, and the other half by their te-
nants, according to the valued rent of their estates.  This, to
be disposed of by a committee as they saw cause.  The num-
ber of poor then taken on the list was 19.  Since that time,
the poor's rates have gradually increased to 65 L. 18 s.  The
number of poor supplied in this way is, at an average, be-
tween 20 and 25.

   Fuel.-The fuel commonly used is peats, which are to be
had in great quantity; but it is often difficult from the wet-
ness of the seasons to get them dried.  The nearest coal is in
Canoby, 18 miles distant.

   Roads.-Formerly this parish was much at a loss for want
of proper communication from one place to another; but now
there is an excellent road from Langholm to the head of the
 moor; and another from the church to Moffat, Dumfries, and
Lockerbie.  There is only a bridge wanting over the Esk
and this is to be set about in a short time.
