     Of Canoby.

   Schools.-There is a parochial or public, and five private
schools in the parish.  The number of scholars of present
attending the whole, amounts at least to 300.  The parish
schoolmaster has a legal salary of 200 merks, a house and
garden; which, with the emoluments of his office of ses-
sion-clerk, may be equal to 20 l. , independent of school
fees.  About 70 of the above number of scholars belong
to the public school, and are taught English, French, La-
tin, and Greek; writing, arithmetick, book-keeping, and
mathematicks.  In the private schools are taught only
reading, writing, and arithmetick.

   Language.-A mixture of the provincial dialects of
Cumberland, Annandale, and Efkdale, seems to form the
language commonly used here, which is very incorrect in
point of grammatical propriety; and with respect to ac-
cent, harsh and unpleasant.  The plainest rules of syntax
are much violated:  For example; I is, thou is; Pse gaan,
for, I am going; thou'se get, thou shalt get; how'se' t'ou,
how art thou.  I wite is't, a common expression, mean-
ing, I wot it is; in plain English, it is so.  The word
canny is much in use here, as well as on the other side
the border, and denotes praise.  A canny person, or thing;
a good sort of person, etc.  In you, the diphthong is
founded as in trout; and the vowel in me, as the diph-
thong in feign.

economy.  Those who are sober and attentive, live comfortably, amd
being up their families in a decent manner; and some even save a little
money for future emergencies.

   Nature has been extremely bountiful to Canoby in fuel.  Besides the
coal mines already mentioned, there is abundance of moss in different
situations, open to the free use of all the inhabitants.  Coals may be
purchased upon the bank, at the rate of 5 d.  the horse load; four of
which, value 1s. 8 d, being as much as any single horse can draw in a
cart.
