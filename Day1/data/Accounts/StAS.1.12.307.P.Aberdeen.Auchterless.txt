   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the po-
pulation in 1755 was 1264.  When the present incumbent
was settled here in 1774, and visited his parish next spring,
there were 1360 souls in it; at present there are scarcely
1200.  This decrease is owing to several causes.  On one e-
state some extensive farms have been waste, and several crofts
for a number of years.  On other estates, two farms have
been put into one.  On all these were many families, who
have gone to manufacturing towns, or otherwise, where they
have daily employment.  There are not 40 dissenters in the
parish; 3 of them Roman Catholics, 5 Seceders, and the rest
Episcopals.  There are 6 heritors, one of whom only resides
in the parish at present.  From January 1775 to January
1793, there have been 536 baptisms and 170 marriages,
which, at an average, is 10 marriages and about 31 bap-
tisms in the year.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, etc.-A new handsome church was
built in 1780, and the manse in 1769.  The stipend, includ-
ing communion elements, grass-money, etc. is about 40 L. 10 s.
with 48 bolls oat-meal.  An augmentation of 48 bolls meal,
and a small addition for communion elements was decreed by
the court of teinds in February 1791, but never yet localled.
The glebe, and a small garden, measure 6 acres.  The patron-
age is claimed by the Crown, and Mr. Duff of Hatton, the
principal heritor:  When a vacancy happens, both present to
the living.-There is a parochial school here.  The salary is
8 L. 6 s. 8 d.  By the session-clerkship, marriages, baptisms, and
school-fees, the living will be, communibus annis, upwards of
20 L.-There are at present 16 poor and indigent persons on
the roll, principally reduced to poverty by old age and dis-
tempers.  The fund for their maintenance arises from the vo-
luntary contributions of the parishioners on the Sundays, and
