     Statistical Account

   By the side of the river of Glencross, there is a vein seve-
ral feet wide, entirely filled with that mineral substance call-
ed heavy spar.  It is a fossil that abounds in many of the
richest metallic veins, both in Scotland, and in foreign coun-
tries; and affords indeed a probable indication of metals, es-
pecially of lead.  This vein appears to have been worked a
little way in former times, but had soon been given up.  It
is not unlikely, that on some future occasion, it may be
thought worthy of further examination.  Of all fossils, this
substance approaches nearest to the the metals in specific
gravity.  It has even been presumed to be of a metallic na-
ture.  No metal, however, has yet been extracted from it,
not has it ever been applied to any use more profitable, than
as a flux, to facilitate the fusion of the ores of metals.

   Trees.-There is a silver fir at Woodhouselee, which is
the oldest tree of its species in Mid Lothian, and has always
been admired for its size and beauty.  It was planted in a
dry soil, in a garden, about the first year of the present cen-
tury.  In March 1759, at 4 feet above the ground, it mea-
sured 7 feet 4 3/4 inches in circumference.  In March 1793,
at the same height, it measured 11 feet 1 4/5 inches.  During
these 33 years, it therefore increased in circumference 45
inches.  Its greatest growth was in the year 1760, when it
increased precisely 2 inches.  During all the other years, its
increase in circumference was from one inch, to 1 1/2 inch an-
nually.  This fine tree, however, is now upon the decay.  It
is ascertained, from other instances, that the age of the silver
sir, is limited, in this country, to within a century.  It is in
its greatest perfection, when about 80 years old; and if plac-
ed in a proper situation, it is capables during all that period,
of increasing upon an average, above a cubic foot of wood an-
nually.  From some full grown trees of this kind, lately fel-
