preservation, and contains meager details of the proceedings of
session, a register of baptisms and one of marriages, together with
accounts of collections and disbursements. It ends about 1640,
and there is a hiatus till 1651, when separate volumes for baptisms
and marriages respectively are begun and continued, in the case of
the former without interruption to the present time, and in the lat-
ter with only a few blanks from 20th December 1678 to 29th
June 1679; from 18th November 1688 to 18th May 1692; and
from 26th November 1605 to 1st June 1697, from which date
they are complete. There is only one volume entitled "the de-
functs in the parish of Newton since the 11th July 1731." It ends
with 1761, and there is no other till 1823, when a more perfect
register of deaths and burials was began. All these volumes are
in good preservation.
   A volume for the minutes of session was also begun in 1651 and
ends with 1671 at the one side, and recommences with 29th June
1679 at the other, on which day it is said, "Ninian Miln, for-
merly reader, precentor, and schoolmaster at Bolton, was received
reader, precentor, and schoolmaster in the parish of Neatone."
It ends with January 1694. The next volume commences With
21st November 1697, from which date the minutes are complete,
and contain a full record of the strict discipline that, for a long pe-
riod, was exercised for the reformation of manners, and of other
ecclesiastical proceedings.
   Antiquities.-An ancient edifice adjoining the village of Ed-

formation for the parish of Wymet, was afterwards converted into
a chapel, where the laird of Edmonstone received permission from
the presbytery (1641), to have "reading of prayers morning and
evening, providing it were not prejudicial to the public exercises
in the church," and where, by the same authority children were
permitted to be baptized, "providing always the people should be
there present at public worship." In process of time, it came to

of the parish, is still entire, and has been preserved to form a fea-
ture in the landscape as seen from the grounds in Dalkeith park.
The church-yard around it, where parties have long since ceased
to bury, has been sadly desecrated by the encroachments of the
