narrow islands, washed on all sides by the German and At-
lantic oceans, attended with material injury to boats, ships,
and the growing corn.  The sea, arising from its bed, dashes a-
gainst the rocks:-the winds waft its spray over the surface of
the isles:-and thus the crop, Boum Labores, the husbandman's
support and hope throughout the year, is blasted in an hour.
Boats are overset, ships are wrecked, and the hardy mariners

damages from this cause.  After a storm of this kind, the
stalk of oats or bear whitens, consumes, and dies.  But if the

part of their former vigour.  Even the natural grass escapes
not altogether unhurt.  There is less frost and snow, and a
more equal temperature, as to heat and cold, in Orkney, than
can be found perhaps in any other county of Scotland.

   Harbours.-Widewall bay lies on the West side of South
Ronaldsay, and has a good opening to the Pentland Frith
and to Stromness.  Ships of 500 or 600 tons burden, parti-
cularly those from the Baltic, Westward bound, frequently
side in it with safety.  On the North end of the same island,
there is another harbour, called St Margaret's Hope, which,
for small vessels, is one of the safest and best in the kingdom.
It is much frequented by lobster smacks, belonging to Mr.
Selby and Co. London, and to the Nortumberland Fishing So-
ciety.  For a considerable time past, different English Com-
panies have prosecuted this fishery, and, strange to tell!  it is
