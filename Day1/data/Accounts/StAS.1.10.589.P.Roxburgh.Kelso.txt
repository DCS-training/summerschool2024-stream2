   Articles of Trade.-The shopkeepers, who are the most
respectable class of traders, deal to a great extent, in all

for various kinds of grass seeds.  These different articles
amount to a great sum; but, from the difficulty of ascer-
taining it, I forbear giving a statement; it may, however,
be curious and interesting to mention the quantities of ex-
ciseable wines, spirits, etc. consumed yearly in Kelso, and
the adjacent country, exclusive of what is commissioned by
people of the higher rank, from wine merchants at a dis-
tance.
