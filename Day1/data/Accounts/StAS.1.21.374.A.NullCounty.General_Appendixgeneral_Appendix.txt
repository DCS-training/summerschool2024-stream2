most as flat as a water-level, and mightily enriched by its
depositing there much of its fine earth and sediment.
   Time, however, and some small banks raised against its
overflowings by the country people, about 30 years ago, has
caused a change in the river in this valley; it widened and
deepened its bed, by whick it does not now overflow its
banks perhaps once a year.  By this change, the banks are
become from 12 to 14 feet higher than the bed of the ri-
ver at low water, and produce excellent oats and potatoes,

dery, and mills, which are now disused for want of charcoal;
the weekly market is also disused, there being no trade stir-
ring, but 4 annual fairs are held for the sale of cattle.  The
