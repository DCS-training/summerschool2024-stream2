of sand and gravel, with which the 'shore abounds,and depositing
these, in its courses till the bank has thus been extended- in th-e
form above,described. , This theory is supported by the fact' tbats-,
close along the north or upper 'side, the water is very deep, while
on the south or under side it is very shallow, and the ebb is con-

word, in the Gaelic language, descriptive of a projecting ridge or
bank in the sea is Oitir, hence the origin of the names Otter,
given to an adjoining estate, and also the title of the family to
wfiich it belongs,-Campbell of Otter.
Climate.-The climate is generally mild. In winter the frost
is seldom severe; and the snow soon disappears from the low
grounds, as it does also from the higher lands in the vicinity of the
loch.
