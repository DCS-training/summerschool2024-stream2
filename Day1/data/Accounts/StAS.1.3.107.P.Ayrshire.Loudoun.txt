   Climate, Situation, and Diseases.-This parish is situated at
the extremity of the sine strath upon the river of Irvine.  It
is bounded by very high hills on the north and south.  We
have much rain, but very little snow.  The narrow strath
from east to west forms a kind of ventilator, which, un-

from improper management, by immediately bleeding, which
was found to be very fatal by those of the Faculty who first

is the consumption.  Scrophula or white swelling is frequent

shops, where they never have a fire.  There are a few re-
markable instances of longevity.  Lady Loudoun died at the

twixt the middle and end of May.  We sow very little pease,
and no beans, or wheat.  Every person, whether in town or
country, plants a few potatoes.  Some few farmers sow rye-
