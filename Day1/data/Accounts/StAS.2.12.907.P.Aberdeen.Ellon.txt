nisbed by the register of baptisms and marriages, would the num-
ber of inhabitants, though increasing upon the whole by a very
slow ratio, seem to have undergone any considerable change for
the half century immediately preceding.  Of late years, however,
as will be apparent from an inspection of the following returns, the
increase of population has ban much more rapid.

Population according to returns made to Government:

	  In 1801,   .    Males, 969    Females, 1053     Total, 2022
           1811,              1078             1116            2194
           1821,              1093             1057            2150
           1831,              1157             1147            2304
           1841,                                               2949

     Population according to a census taken by the minister of the parish
        In 1837,        Males, 1376   Females. 1429     Total, 2805

   It is believed, from the great pains taken in making up the re-
turns last given, and from the substantial confirmation of their ac-
curacy afforded by another census subsequently taken by the mi-
nister, though with less care, that the results of the census of 1837,
as stated above, may be entirely relied on.  There may be some
difficulty, however, in accounting, on satisfactory grounds, for the
rapid increase of population which would thus appear to have
taken place since 1831.  Such increase, the writer conceives, may
be ascribed, in part at least, to the three following causes, each
of which has unquestionably operated, to some small extent, in
adding to the amount of population.  1. Some additional houses
have been built in the village of Ellon, and, as a single house in
the village is frequently divided among several families, the increase
of population arising from this cause may furnish no inconside-
rable fraction of the amount to be accounted for;-12.  In several
districts of the parish, and particularly on those estates on which
there was formerly a wide extent of waste land, cultivation has
been extending itself for some years past by rapid strides.  In va-
rious, instances new cottages have been erected, each having at-
tached to it a piece of reclaimable ground, in the improvement of
which the cottagers, with their families, are now busily engaged.
Much has been done also in the reclaiming of waste lands, upon
the larger farms, and an additional number of servants or day-la-
bourers hag been required in consequence;-3. As agriculture has
been, upon the whole, in an improving condition for the last six or
eight years, and as, more particularly in this district, a powerful
stimulus has been applied to it by the new facilities afforded by
steam navigation for the transportation of fat cattle to the London
market, the farmers have found it to be their interest, even in cases
where there was no waste land to be improved, to expend a greater
