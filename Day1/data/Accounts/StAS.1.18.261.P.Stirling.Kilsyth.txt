     of Kilsyth.

   The first exhibits at one glance, a distinct view of the num-
ber of houses, families, heads of families, widows, widowers,
children, farmers, and male and female servants, in each dis-
trict separately.  For I think it more consistent with the ob-
ject of a statistical account, to give a detail of the proportion
of inhabitants in each district apart; than merely to state
the number of the whole parish.  By this means it will be an
easy matter to say in any future period, whither the town or
country part of the parish is increasing or decreasing: and
in what proportion and denomination of inhabitants.
   The second table exhibits a distinct view of the number of
children in each family of every district; that are at the time
alive.
   The third represents the number of each denomination,
and of every class of inhabitants.

<FOOTNOTE>

But a part, if not a principal part of these funds ought to be established by
law, as a support for the widows and children of the respective members of
each society.  Or, if the funds already collected are found insufficient for
that purpose, why, might not each member become bound to pay a small
additional sum for the purpose of establishing a widows fund?  A trifling
sum annually from each would serve the purpose.  But perhaps the wisest
measure that could be adopted, would be to unite the friendly societies into
larger bodies, and the tradesmen of the same craft throughout the kingdom
into one society.  The common stock, if allowed to accumulate for a few
years, would soon be sufficient to answer all the purposes of their widows and
their poor, and more effectually than the funds of small and separate socie-
ties.
