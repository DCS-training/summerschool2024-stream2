                                WICK.                             129

       mains of a submarine forest.  These are like peat moss, entirely
       composed of decayed wood.  The barks of various kinds of trees
       are quite discernible; and even the seeds of the birch and ash
       are so well preserved, as to appear but lately from the tree.  No
       large trunks are found; only small specimens of oak, ash, birch,
       and plane-tree; but none of fir.
         Mammalogy.-Remains of bovine ruminants of a very large size
       have been found in the mosses and marl-pits of this parish.  The
       wolf and the wild-goat were once common in the district, but
       have both been extinct long ago.
          The wild-cat is occasionally seen.  Otters are often found.
       The Links of Reiss Are stored with rabbits.  Hares are numerous.
       The fox breeds in the rocks about the coast.  Moles are super-
       abundant.  Weasels, ferrets, and polecats, are not uncommon.
       Ermines have been found at Stirkoke.  A stray deer from the
       heights of Morven is occasionally met with.
         The native breed of horses, still employed by the smaller ten-
       ants, is diminutive and weak.  Their provincial name is garrons.
       The original stock of cattle was also small, but the beef was ex-
       cellent.  Probably the ancient Cathanensian breed of sheep is not
       yet altogether extinct in the parish of Wick.  They are very
       small, with a dirty brown fleece and four small horns.
          Ornithology.-By the kindness of Eric Sutherland Sinclair,
       Esq., surgeon in Wick, who has paid much attention to this sub.
       ject, this Report is enriched with the following " List of birds found
       in the county of Caithness, and principally in the parish of Wick."
       It cannot fail to be extremely interesting; and may astonish some
       with the extent and-variety of Cathanensian ornithology.  Mr Sin-
       clair has formed with his own hands-an extensive ornithological
       collection illustrative of the natural history of the district.  All the
       birds in the subsequent list, except those marked with an asterisk,
       are in this learned gentleman's museum.
