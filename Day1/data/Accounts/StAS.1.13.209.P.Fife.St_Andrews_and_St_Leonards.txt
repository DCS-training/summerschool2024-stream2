side of Boarhills:  In this last case, the moor was under 
lease as a part of the farm; the tenant, without any de-
duction of rent, was at the expense of enclosing and plant-
ing, and continues to have the burden of defending; at the 
end of 50 years, the tenant's heirs get half the value of 
the wood.  The usual varieties of forest-trees are among
these plantations; but the Scotch fir is in greatest quantity.
All the usual pot-herbs are in great plenty.  Gardening
becomes yearly an object of more attention.  Every far-
mer raises wheat, barley or bear, oats, peace and beans, 
turnips, potatoes, clover.  The quantity of land sown with
wheat increases every year.  Barley is now more cultivated
than bear; but perhaps more than either, a mixture of the 
two, which is called ramble.  Rutabaga, or Swedish tur-
nip, has been tried, but not persisted in.  The drill-husban-
dry is followed only with the potatoes and turnip, and a 
few beans.  The parish, including the city, needs an im-
portation of meal, but it spares barley.
   The number of black cattle in this parish, as in all the
neighbourhood, is yearly diminishing; as the farmers now 
do all their work with horses alone; two of which are 
yoked in the plough, and guided by the ploughman.
Within these 30 years, each plough had 2 horses and 
4 oxen, which always needed a goodman,  The culture of 
grasses and of wheat has gradually expelled the sheep from
this parish, all the land that could yield them any tolera-
ble pasture being now subjected to the plough.  There re-
mains not a store-stock in the whole parish.  A few are 
kept on the Links of St Andrew's chiefly for the sham-
bles, the present tacksman being a butcher.  Some of the 
farmers also graze a few for the butchers*.

to sow oats and beans.  The sowing of barley and bear terminate in the
