The only tumulus recollected in this parish was about 1 1/2
mile westward from St Andrew's, on the south road to
Cupar, called Pitoutie Law.  In forming the highway,
about 30 years ago, it was thought necessary to remove
this tumulus.  Nothing was found but stones and earth.
   -The general size of the people is from 5 feet 8 inches to
5 feet 10 inches.  In one family, there are 2 or 3 young
men, who measure 6 feet 3 inches; one of them, 6 feet
5 inches.  The people of this parish are fober, temperate,
and industrious; more addicted to the arts of tranquil life
