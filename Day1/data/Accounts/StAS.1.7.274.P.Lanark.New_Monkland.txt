living more decent, and their usefulness more general.  This
could be levied without expence, and such a trifle would ne-
ver be missed by the proprietors.-The number of poor on
the parish roll, are between 40 and 50.  The sum distribut-
ed among them, for some time past, is about 70 L. annually.
The funds for supplying them do not exceed 100 L. the inte-
rest of which, with the collection at the church doors, mort-
cloths or pall-dues, proclamations of the banns of marriage,
and an extraordinary collection on the first Sabbath of June
yearly, has hitherto raised a sum equal to the yearly distribu-
tion.  There are 4 different charitable societies in the town
of Airdrie, who have about 500 L. of stock, and are very use-
ful in supporting poor members.  Their funds are well ma-
naged, and increasing yearly.  If such societies were esta-
blished in every parish, and properly conducted, they would
be very beneficial, particularly in times of dearth, by laying
out their stock for the purchase of grain, and selling it to the
poor at prime cost, as was done here in the year 1783, upon
the general failure of the preceding crop*.

   Minerals and Mineral Springs.-Coal and iron stone are,
or may be found, almost in every farm.  The Monkland coal
has been long samed for the quality and richnets of its seams.
Twenty years ago, coal sold so low as 6 d. the cart load; but
since the Monkland navigation was opened, it sells at 18 d.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There are few or no begging poor in the parish; but no
place of the country is more pettered with vagrants and gyp-
sies, as there is neither work-house, jail, nor resident magi-
strate in the parish.  A set of respectable constables who under-
stood, and could properly exercise, the ample powers committed
to them, might be of great use, in cleaning the country of such
vagrants; but as this office is generally filled by the most ig-
norant and worthless, they are become a nuisance instead of a
benefit.
