4 miles west of the town; the house containing the mill is
built to a rock, and seems to be an object of considerable
antiquity.
   There are likewise the remains of an old building, situate
upon a fertile hill, about a mile N. W. of the town of Pe-
terhead; part of a wall still remains, and a pavement of
some extent overgrown with grass.  A neighbouring well
still retains the name of the Abbot's Well.  Some well
dressed stones, that have been evidently taken from the
ruins, are observable in the adjacent buildings.  Many slates
have been dug up about the place, and a few coins, the in-
scriptions of which were entirely obliterated; human bones
have likewise been found inclosed in cells built of stone.
There is no tradition to ascertain precisely what these ruins
are; from the name of the well it is supposed to have been
an Abbey.  It is more probable it was the residence of
some monks belonging to the Abbey of Deer, which had
very extensive property before the Reformation, and pos-
sessed a great part of this parish.  The ruins of the Abbey
are still to be seen at Old Deer; several of their monks
possessed extensive farms at a distance, and some of them
probably enjoyed the farm in this neighbourhood, and at
the same time might have a place of worship and burial
place; and if the Abbot occasionally visited them, or with-
out this circumstance, they might give to their well the
name of the head of their order.

   Natural Curiosities.-About two years ago, on digging
for a well for the accommodation of the family at the manse,
at the depth of about 8 or 10 feet, a complete skeleton of a
deer was found; the greatest part of the ribs fell imme-
diately to dust on being exposed to the air; the horns were
more entire, and one of them is still preserved as a curio-
sity.  One of my predecessors, who was settled here about
