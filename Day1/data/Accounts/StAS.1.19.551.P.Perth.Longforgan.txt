date of the year, in some conspicuous part of the house.
This custom is now entirely done away; and in its room,
to each shearer is given 6d. and a loaf of bread.  However,
some farmers, when all their corns are brought in, give-
their servants a dinner, and a jovial evening, by way of
Harvest-home.

   Expence of Thrashing.-Thrashing out the corns used to
be a very expensive article, especially when done by la-
bourers on day-wages; but the general practice was a 25th
part of the grain.  Upon a farm in this parish, of 180 acres,
it cost, on an average of 6 years, about L. 32, very nearly

   Roads.-Previous to the year 1790, all the roads through
the Carse of Gowrie were exceedingly bad; and the whole
statute labour of this parish was found insufficient to uphold
the four miles of post road which passes through it.  That
year an act of Parliament was obtained to make certain
roads in the country of Perth turnpike, and amongst others
the road through the Carse from Perth to Dundee, and its
three branches, leading to the harbours of Polgavie, Errol,
and Inchyra; which, by the liberal subscription and un-
wearied attention of the proprietors, are now made equal
to the best roads in the kingdom, but at the expence of
L. 13,000 to the Carse proprietors, who are trustees.  Since
that time the trustees have made it a rule to apply the
statute labour, through the whole Carse, solely to the bye-
roads, or other roads of communications.  In the parish of
Longforgan, not only this rule has been observed, but the
heritors have contributed largely for the same purpose, to
the amount of several hundred pounds; by which means
several of these roads, already made are very little inferior
