   Heritors, Rent, etc.-There are only two heritors, one of
whom is proprietor of nearly the whole parish, but does not
reside in it.  The rent, after Whitsunday next, will be near
1200 L. Sterling.  The farms, which were let in lease about
7 years ago, and, since that time, pay, on an average, double
the former rent, and are still increasing in value.  After the
introduction of sheep into this country, the proprietors found
in their interest, to let as much ground to one man as he
could stock, so that the principal farms in this parish and
neigbourhood are in the hands of a few.  One man pos-
sesses now what was formerly thought sufficient for 5 or 6
tenants, and yet the condition of the lower class is not ren-
dered worse.  About 40 years ago, some of the tenants could
afford to pay very little more than the public burdens for
these farms, which now pay a high rent to the proprietor.
Formerly, every tacksman was bounf to perform work with
men and horses, a certain number of days yearly, or to pay
so much in lieu thereof , in the option of the master; but in
most of the leases, which have been granted of late, these
personal services, and the other casualities payable by the te-
nants, are converted into cash, and included in the rent.

   Occupation.-The small tenants and cottagers find employ-
ment, either in repairing the high roads along with the mili-
tary, building dykes, manufacturing timber and barks in
woods, or at the herring fishing, which and generally at-
tend, from the beginning of harvest till New Year's day.

   Prices of Labour.-On an average, the wages of a man ser-
vant are 1 s. a day, from the beginning of February till the
beginning of November, without victuals.  The day's wages
of a wright are 1 s.; of a taylor 8 d.; of a carpenter 1 s.
6 d.; of a shoemaker 8 d.; and of a mower of hay 1 s. be-
