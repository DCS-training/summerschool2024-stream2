vised to have got the plan executed.  Though former at-
tempts to get a bridge erected over the Dee at Pot-arch,
have repeatedly proved abortive, we shall still hope that
soon some public spirited character may be found, who will
strive to see the attempt crowned with success.  Subscrip-
tions could be obtained to some amount, but still it is to be
feared that public aid would be absolutely necessary.  Be-

hands is employed at the Earl of Aboyne's lime-works
at Birse Moor.  It is, however, much against the im-
prover, that fuel is to difficult to be obtained.  The greater
part of the summer season must be spent in procuring that
necessary article, consequently little of it can be spared to
burn the limestone.  Finding, however, the great benefit
of lime as a manure, amazing exertions are made to pro-
cure fuel, (to burn the limestone), not only by cutting
cart roads along the steep hills, to the mosses, and by pur-
chasing wood, but even by going at times to Aberdeen
for coals, which pay the high duty, and must be brought
across the Dee.  In this case, the want of a bridge at Port-
