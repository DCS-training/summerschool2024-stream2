   Hydroqraphy. - There are a great many mineral springs
in this parish, which might with very little trouble be converted
into excellent wells. On the farm of Bogroy, there is a chalybeate
spring, which contains a small quantity of carbonic acid,
and a great quantity of iron. Another mineral well on the farm
of Felocbans, near the village of Archiestown, partakes much of
the same ingredients. In the wood of Wester EIcbies is the well
of Topran, or the Sabbath Well, which contains a trace of sul-
pburic acid united with soda, a small quantity of carbonic acid gas
and salt, according to an analysis made by Mr Shier, lecturer on
chemistry, and late assistant to Dr David Boswell Reid of Edinburgh.
The Topran Well affords a general specimen of the
common drinking water.of the parish.
   There are two small locos in the moorlands, viz. BensbaIgs, and
Loch Coulalt, or the loch of the small burn. The latter is about
a mile in circumference, the former not so much.
   A number of ,burns water the parish, the principal of which are
the burn of Aldyoulie or Ault Gheallaidb, (this name in Gaelic
signifies Burn of the Covenant, and it is generally believed that a
paction between two contending clans had been entered into upon
