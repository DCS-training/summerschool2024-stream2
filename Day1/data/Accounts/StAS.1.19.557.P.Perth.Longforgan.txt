other marine shells, but no vegetable substances.  4th, A
strong blue clay, 3 1/2 feet deep, containing sea shells, and
roots of vegetables, the growth of which would seem to
have been checked by the superincumbent stratum.  5th,
Also a strong blue clay, with yellowish seams in it, about
5 feet deep, and containing a much greater proportion of ve-
getable substances than the 4th stratum, but under like cir-
cumstances.  The river rises to the surface of this stratum
in stream tides.  6th, Three feet deep of the same kind of
strong blue clay, mixed with more than double the quantity
of vegetable roots than in the 5th stratum, but which also
seem to have been born down, and their vegetation extin-
guished by some superior pressure.  These three are sepa-
rated from each other by a small seam of sand and clay,
which forms a pretty exact line of division, and through
which the vegetable roots do not seem to have passed.  7th,
A real peat moss, near four feet deep, quite full of various
kinds of vegetables, with roots, trunks, and branches of trees;
the surface of which forms the bed of the Tay; in many
places of which the moss can be distinctly traced, perfectly
entire, clean, and firm, without having received the least
injury from the flux and reflux of the tide; and out of which,
at other places, great quantities of peats for fuel have been
dug at different periods, and are so still.  It is very re-
markable, that in this stratum many roots of large trees
are to be found, principally allar (alder) and birch, at
about 13 feet distant from each other, perfectly upright, in
the same situation in which the trees had originally grown,
with their ramifications extended among the moss, and some
of their smaller fibres penetrating the clay below.  The
trunks and branches of the trees lying horizontally are all
fresh, and have the appearance of having been borne down
and laid flat by some powerful cause; and what is also
