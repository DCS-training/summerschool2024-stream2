     NUMBER XVII.

     PARISH OF BEITH.

     (Counties of Ayr and Renfrew.-Presbytery of Irvine.-Synod
      of Glasgow and Ayr.)

     By the Rev. Mr. DAVID M'CLELLAN.

     Situation and Extent.

   THIS parish lies within the county of Ayr, and district
of Cunningham; excepting 4 farms which belong to
Renfrewshire, on the border of which it is situated.  It ex-
tends about 5 miles in length, from E. to W. and its
breadth is about 4.  The land rises by a gradual ascent from
S. to N. where there is a small ridge of hills, whose summits
are elevated, perhaps about 400 feet, above the lowest ground.
in the parish, or 500 feet above the level of the sea.

   Rent, Heritors, Cultivation, etc.-The valued rent, of that
part of the parish which lies in Ayrshire, is 6115 L. 14 s. 2 d.
Scotch; and that of the 4 farms in Renfrewshire, 163 L. 6 s.
8 d.  The real rent is believed to be in some places 6 times,
in others, 8 times, and, perhaps in others, owing to their vi-
cinity to the town of Beith, the richness of the soil, or the
high cultivation of the lands, even 12 times the valued rent,
