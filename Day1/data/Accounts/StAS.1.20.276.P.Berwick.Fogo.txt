     Statistical Account

   All the teinds in the parish are valued, from whence
are paid the stipend, which was lately augmented, the school
salary, and the sums necessary for repairing the church,
manse, office, and school-house.  The stipend is now fixed 
at L. 100 per annum; the old stipend was L. 77, 10 s.; con-
sequently there has been an augmentation of L. 22, 10 s.

   Antiquities.-The only mark of antiquity found in this
parish is at a village called Chesters, which has all the ap-
pearance of an old Roman encampment; but now very 
much defaced.
   There is an ancient bridge over the Blackadder, at Fo-
go, of great advantage to the neighbourhood, as in the win-
ter season the water frequently cannot be forded.  This 
bridge is kept in repair by the county, and is the only one 
in the parish.

   Disadvantages.-This place and neighbourhood labour
under the disadvantage of being at a distance from coal, the 
only fel used in the parish.  It is brought from North-
umberland, at the distance of about 12 miles.  Lime is very 
scarce and dear.  To these circumstances, unfavourable for 
agriculture, and the comfort of the people, may be added 
the thirlage to mills.
