is not a fisherman in Largo, and 1 in Drumochy, who
fishes in summer, and catches rabbits in winter.-The har-
bour of Largo is formed by the influx of the water Keil.
There is a stone key, where vessels of 200 ton may receive
or discharge their cargoes; but at no great expence it might
be made to admit of ships of greater burden.  The whole
bay froms a safe road-stead for ships of every description,
being sheltered from all winds, except the S. and S. W.;
and were it better known, might be a mean of preserving
many lives, particularly when ships are forced into the
Forth by storms from the N. E.

   Mountains.-There is but I large hill, well known by
the name of Large Law.  It is of a conical form, and rises
about 800 feet above the level of the sea.  Perhaps the
name Law was given to this and many other hills of simi-
lar form, from the flame that did, or was supposed to have
issued from their tops.  The Swedes call flame, 'loa;' and
the Danes, 'lue;' which resemble in sound our Scotch
word 'low;' a flame.  In support of this conjecture, there
are, in the possession of Mr James Calderwood-Durham of
Largo, several proclamations from the Privy-council of
Scotland, ordering fires to be kindled on Largo Law, and
that of North Berwick, as signals for the appearance of
any ships of the enemy.-Besides this, there are 2 other
Laws.  But it is evident that there have been artificial.
When the cairn was removed from one of there, a few
years ago, a stone coffin was found at the bottom.  From
the position of the bones, it appeared that the person had
been buried in  a singular manner.  The legs and arms
had been carefully severed from the trunk, and laid dia-
gonally across it.
