     Statistical Account

labourers are obliged to work, is never thought of in this
neighbourhood.  People of better condition think of what
they can afford to execute, and servants and labourers are left
to their own judgment, as to what they will undertake.  Thus
in all things necessary, labour and reward meet one another
on equitable terms.

   Health and Longevity.-As the occupations, followed by the
people, are not prejudicial to the health, sickness is not fre-
quent, especially of late years; and since the houses of the
tenantry and labourers were built of better materials, and
rendered more convenient, warm and cleanly,-more parti-
cularly, since these dwellings were improved, the burials of
infants have decreased in a surprising proportion.  The dif-
eases usually prevalent are thole arising from cold, hard lan-
bour, and other debilitating causes; and such distempers are
found to yield readily to strengthening medicines.  There is
one surgeon in the parish, who practices through several other
parishes adjacent.  Attornies we have none.-As not only
the labours usually followed, but the air* and climate, are
friendly to health, longevity is not uncommon.  Within these
15 years, several persons have died at the age of 100, or above
it.  One Peter Buchanan died in the village of Dalbeaty,
about 10 years ago.  His age could not be exactly fixed; but
this much is certain, that he was above 115 years old.  He
was surprisingly healthy mad active to the day of his death,
and died of about half an hour's sickness.  There are just
now two or three persons in Urr aged 90, and several above
fourscore.  Even at the age of 70, or above it, it is not un-
usual to fee a labourer subsisting himself, and earning the
usual day's wages: Nor is there a poor person in the parish,

*Upon fair experiment, it will be found, that the thermometer stands higher
in this part of Galloway (communibus diebus), than it does at London.
