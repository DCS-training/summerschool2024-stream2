     Parish of Dalmeny.

     'Sir,
   'I have with much pleasure read your Statisti-
'cal History of Scotland; yet at the same time regret the
'mistake concerning the Moubray family of Barnbougle,
'it being represented "that a peasant in the parish of Dal-
"meny is the only descendant of that ancient family."
   'As I understand another edition is soon to be published,
'I think it therefore due to you, Sir, as well as to my Son,
'to request you will do me the favour to refer to Mr. Nis-
'bet's System of Heraldry, 2 d volume, Appendix, page 22,
"Historical and Critical Remark," page 12, which will
'clearly and fully satisfy you with every particular; having
'furnished himself with a sight of our documents; and
'indisputably proves, that Robert, my eldest Son, an offi-
'cer in the 80 th regiment, now serving in the East Indies,
'and in possession of the old paternal estate of Colcairney,
'alias Cockairney; is progressively in an accurate line the
'lineal descendant of the Barnbougle family.
   'I beg leave to apologize for giving you this trouble;
'but trust you will receive equal pleasure with myself, in
'doing justice to a family, who, upwards of 500 years ago,
'were distinguished for their valour and adherence to the
'Crown.
     'I have the honour to be, SIR,
     'Your obedient
     'COCKAIRNEY, 'and humble Servant,
     'near Aberdour, Fifeshite,}
     'December 17 th, 1796.' 'ARABELLA MOUBRAY.'

     
     ' To Sir John Sinclair, Bart. M. P.'
