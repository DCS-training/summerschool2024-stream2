   Fuel.-The fuel made use of in this parish is peats,
which are seldom good owing to the rainy seasons, and
the moss being at a distance from their dwelling-houses, so

there is a matter of doubt whether coals be not cheaper.
Though they have not yet availed themselves of the libe-

meat is requisite.  Men servants maintained in the family
receive per annum from L. 2 to L. 3 for wages; the wo-
