                  PARISH OF NORTH KNAPDALE.

           PRESBYTERY OF INVERARY, SYNOD OF ARGYLE.

                THE REV. D. MACLACHLAN, MINISTER.

         I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATUITAL HISTORY.
  Name, &c.--THE whole district of Knapdale formed originally
one parish, called Cil mhic O charmaiq, the burying-ground of the
son of O'Carmaig. This O'Carmaig is said to have been an
Irish saint, who founded the first church in Knapdale. In 1734,
the district of Knapdale was divided into two parishes, called
North and South Knapdale.
  Knapdale is compounded of two Gaelic words, Cnap, a hill or
an eminence, and Daill, a dale or field. The name is very de-
scriptive of the local aspect of the parish, which is beautifully di-
versified by plains and valleys separated by hills, and watered
by a multitude of small rivulets.
  Extent and Boundaries. It is about 13 1/2 miles in length from
northeast to south-west, and about 6 miles in breadth, including
a narrow arm of the sea, which divides the parish into two nearly
equal parts. From the extreme irregularity of its surface, it is
difficult to specify its precise extent ; but we are not perhaps far
from the truth in estimating it at 76 square miles. It is bounded
on the south and south-east by the parish of South Knapdale; on
the east and north-east, by the Crinan Canal and Loch Crinan;
on the west and south-west, by the Sound of Jura, which separates
that island from the mainland.
   Topographical Appearances.-It is of an oblong form. Its ap-
pearance is diversified by an agreeable variety of hill and dale,
and thriving, plantations, by numerous lakes, and by Lochswen,
an inlet from the Atlantic. This arm of the sea is about ten miles
in length, bearing north-east from its entrance. Its breadth at
the entrance is about a mile, but towards its northern extremity it
widens to nearly three miles, and then divides into three parallel
