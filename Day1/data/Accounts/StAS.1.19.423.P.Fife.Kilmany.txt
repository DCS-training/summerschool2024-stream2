him, must lament the nakedness they display.  He will la-
ment it the more in a scene, where the hand of nature, and
the toils of the husbandman, have done so much to admini-
ster to his delight; where the contrast of broken rocks and
swelling hills, with plains in the richest cultivation; and
where the cultivation, breaking with irregular steps the
bleakness of the hills, sometimes left at their base, some-
times climbing on their sides, concur to form an exquisitely
varied landscape.  How much would it add to the scene,
were the rich corn fields to rise into the bosom of woods
stretching with various length down towards the plain;
were some of the barest summits to escape above their
verdure; and were the beautiful waters of the Tay sees
through openings made thus picturesque?
   Neither would such exertions in improving the country
be unprofitable; nor is the idea of making them visionary.
Independently of the value of the wood, (and it is well
known how soon it does become valuable), it tends, by
affording a warm shelter, to meliorate the adjacent land in
a state of tillage.  From every appearance it is also pro-
bable that the soil, which cannot be ploughed, might bear
a rich covering of wood.  From experience, indeed, little
can be said, for the parish can boast of few attempts to plant
trees; but where sagacity and taste have made the attempt,
and continued the small attention necessary for success, they
have been in general rewarded with a considerable recompense
for the labour, and a rich addition to the beauty of the sur-
rounding scene.  The hill of Forrit, in the parish of Logie,
was, till some years ago, covered with firs; 21 acres on the
estate of Lochmalony, bear them in great perfection, and
we may see them scaling some of the steepest hills in the
neighbourhood*.  In as far, indeed, as the beauty of the

awaken: several plantations have been of late made, and are still making
