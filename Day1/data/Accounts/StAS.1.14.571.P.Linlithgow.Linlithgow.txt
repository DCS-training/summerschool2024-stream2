     Of Linlithgow.

   Remarkable Events that happened at Linlithgow and in its
Environs.-When Edward I. came to assert his claim to
the superiority of Scotland, he lay with hi, vast army, the
night before the battle of Falkirk, on a track of ground to
the E., which, though now enclosed, still retains the name
of the Burrowmuir.  He marched next day through Lin-
lithgow, and defeated the Scotch army under Wallace and
Stewart, Comyn and his adherents having previously with-
drawn themselves.

   Apparition to Fames IV.-The story of this apparition,
which is said to have preceded the battle of Flodden, has

the bridge.  The action proved fatal to Lennox, and his

coins were also found lately in an old house of the town.  when the workmen
were digging for land, about 500, of which 20 were gold, the rest silver.
Many of them had impressions of the different James's, and of Hen-
ry IV. of England.  Some of the gold coins were about the size of a gui-
nea, others the half.  These had their lustre unimpaired, but the silver
pieces were overgrown with rust.
