     Statistical Account

that Cairngall, now in the parish of Longside, formerly
part of this parish, was the place where they were encamp-
ed.  What truth is in either of these conjectures, or if they
deserve any credit, I leave to antiquarians to determine;
only observing, the derivation from the Greek or French
appears to have little foundation, as Peter was part of the
name of this parish before any part of the town was built;
besides, the town was formerly called Keith Inch, and re-

burgh of barony.

   Ancient Extent.-The most ancient name of this parish
was Peter Ugie, which is to be found in many charters.  It
was formerly of much greater extent than at present, and
extended westward on both sides of the Ugie (or its

great part of this parish was taken off, to form, with a part
of Crimond, the parish of Longside, which for some time
was called Western Ugie.

   Situation.-The parish is situate in the county and Sy-
nod of Aberdeen, district of Buchan, and presbytery of Deer,
it is nearly 5 miles long from N. to S. and from 3 to4
from E. to W.; bounded on the S. by the parish of Cru-
den; by Longside on the W.; the water of Ugie, which
separates it from the parish of St Fergus, on the N.; and on
the E. by the German Ocean.

   Surface.-The parish is in general flat, with some little
eminences, which can scarce be called hills; but from these
little eminences, and the hollows formed betwixt them,
the view is a little varied, and from the luxuriancy of the
soil, were belts or clumps of trees interspersed more fre-
