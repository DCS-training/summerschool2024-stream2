ock merchants import rum, sugar, cotton, mahogany, etc.
From America, rice, naval stores, pot-ash, oil, timber, etc.
and from France, Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean,
wines, fruit, etc.  The trade to the Baltic for timber and
naval stores is very considerable.  The coasting trade is car-
ried on to all the ports of Ireland, and of the west of Eng-
land, for grain, etc. and the Canal between the Forth and
the Clyde has opened an extensive trade to the east coast of
Scotland, and to London.-  From Greenock are exported
herrings, coals, and all forts of British manufactures.  From
that port, there are, by the Canal, 44 packets, to Leith,
Dundee, London, to all parts of the North Highlands and
Isles, as far as Orkney; and packets to Liverpool, fine
floops of 80 tons and upwards, well sitted up for the accom-
modation of passengers.
