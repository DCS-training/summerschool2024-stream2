     Statistical Account

are many farms, that have been continued in the possession of
the same families for several generations*.

   Ploughs, Cattle, etc.-The number of ploughs in this pa-
rish may be stated at 115: the number of horses at 560;
most of them are of a pretty large size, and so stout, that 2
of them draw a plough.  The number of black cattle is about
1100.  The cattle are not now so numerous as they were
formerly, but considerably increased in size, from their being
fed with artificial grasses and turnips.  The number of sheep
is about 2500.  They are of a very small size, excepting
few of the large Bakewell breed.

   Prices of Labour.-The price of labour is considerably ad-
vanced within these few years.  The wages of men servants,
employed in husbandry, are from 6 L. to 8 L. when they live in
the family, and 2 pecks of meal in the week when they do
not.  Women servants have generally from 30 s. to 40 s. per
annum, with some perquisites.  The wages paid to reapers,
during harvest, are from 18 s. to 1 L. 10 s.  They are gene-
rally hired for the season, except in those cases when the farm-
ers have cottagers: To cut down their corn is a part of their
stated labour; and, for this and other services, the cottagers
have a free house and a garden.

<FOOTNOTE>

*It is a circumstance that deserves particular notice, as it points out what
industry and a steady economy can produce, and at the same time proves the
laudable fostering care and attention of some proprietors, that a family, of the
name of ANDERSON, have occupied a farm in this parish, on the estate of the
Earl of Moray, for upwards of 400 years.  The present tenant, having produced
to the late Earl of Moray receipts for rents as far back as the time of Earl
Randolph, obtained from his Lordship a renewal of his lease on the most indul-
gent terms.
