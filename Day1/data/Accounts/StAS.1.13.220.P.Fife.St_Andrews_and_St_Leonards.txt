     Statistical Account

According to my latest survey, the number of souls in
the whole parish amounted to 385; of these, there are in
the town, 220; in the suburbs called Argyle, 115; and in
the country, 50.  As the inhabitants of the several districts 
in the city and suburbs, belonging to the parish of St Leo-
nard's, are interspensed with those of the town parish, the
annual average of births, marriages and deaths in any given
period, as also the number of males and females who are 
born and die in that period, must be in proportion to the
numbers of each parish, and need not be repeated.-The 
number of poor upon the session-roll of St Leonard's is
from 6 to 9, besides the occasional poor; and the funds for 
their support are from L. 25 to L. 27 Sterling a-year.-
The stipend of St Leonard's consists of 5 chalders of victual, 
one half of which is oats, and about L. 3 Sterling of mo-
ney, the rent of an acre and half of land mortified about 
a century ago to the minister of St Leoanard's
