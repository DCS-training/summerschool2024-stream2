   Births.-It is well known that the parish registers in
Scotland have seldom been kept for any length of time
with sufficient accuracy.  In this parish, the register of bap-
tisms has been continued with uncommon regularity, from
the year 1655 to the present time.  Many of the sectaries,
and all the people of the Established Church, with few ex-
ceptions, have always registered the birth of their children.
The baptism of children, also, from other parishes, has al-
ways been punctually distinguished; so that a more exact
register of baptisms, for a period of 140 years, is seldom to
be met with.
   From that register it appears:
   1.  That during the above period of 140 years, there
were 2447 males, and 2268 female children baptized, which
fixes the number of males born, compared to that of fe-
males, at 12 to 11 nearly.
   2.  That in some particular years the births of one sex
greatly exceed the other in number; but in the following,
or in a few subsequent years, both sexes return to their or-
dained proportion.  Notwithstanding many temporary in-
equalities, the balance, at last, is preserved upon the poise.
Yet this is but one, among a thousand instances, of an im-
mediate unremitted superintending influence, directed by
unlimited power and wisdom.
   3.  That there are some years in which the inhabitants
are remarkably prolific, compared to what they are in
others.  The number of children born in one year is some-
times nearly double that in the preceding or subsequent
year, while the number of inhabitants must have been near-
ly the same.
   4.  That the average number of births for 10 years past
is 39, and the number of people 1395.  This allows 37
persons for each birth.
