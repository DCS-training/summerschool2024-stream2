David Guthrie, 11th December 1687, and ends 16th February
1696: it begins again at the admission of his successor, Mr
James Robertson, 22d March 1699, and ends 13th November
1726; then it begins again at the admission of his successor, Mr
William Mackenzie, 5th May 1748, and ends 16th May 1760:
it begins again, in Mr Mackenzie's time, 8th March 1768,
and from this date it has been regularly kept.  The register of
baptisms does not begin till 6th November 1768.  Previous to this
time, it is said to have been lost through the negligence of the re-
latives of the session-clerk, about the time of his death.  The re-
gister of marriages does not begin till 4th June 1792.	 Since
these dates, the registers of baptisms and marriages are entire; bud
it does not appear that there ever has been any register of deaths.
   Antiquities.-There are many large heaps of stones, commonly
called cairns, on a heath or moor near Culblean, in the east end
of Tullich: and they are said to cover the graves of those who
fell in flight after the battle of Culblean or Kilblane, which, ac-
cording to Buchanan, B. ix. c.23, was fought between the adher-
ents of King David Bruce and the followers of Cummin, Earl of
Athole, in 1335.  But, as none of these barrows have yet been
opened, it is not known what may be under them, or whether they
may not be of a still earlier date.
   Modern Buildings.-The chief modern buildings are the man-
sion-house of Ballater, row called Monalfrie House; Birkhall, a
seat belonging to Mr Gordon of Abergeldie; the present paro-
chial central church; and a mason hall, all built of granite and
lime, covered with slates, and having the best Scotch fir for roof-
ing and other carpenter-work.  Of meal-mills there are nine, and
three of these have each a drying-kiln, and all their machinery of
a new and improved construction.  Of manufactories there are
none, except a carding-mill for wool, at which also some coarse
cloth is made.  These mills are all driven by water.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
  The number of souls, according to Dr Webster's report, was   .	2270

                                     Census 1811,	.		1894

					              1841,	.		2118

   All these returns show that there has been little difference in
the population for nearly eighty years, except in 1811; and the
cause of the decrease that year cannot now be discovered.  It
