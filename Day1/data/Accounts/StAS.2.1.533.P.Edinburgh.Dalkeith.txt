  Fuel.-Coal from the mines in the neighbourhood is universally
employed for fuel, and the expense, according to the quality, is
from 6s. 8d. to 8s. 4d. per ton;-or 4d. to 5d. per cwt.

                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
  Since the publication of the last Statistical Account, most im-
portant improvements have taken place in Dalkeith.  New houses,
churches, and streets have been built; the hamlets have been
rendered more comfortable;-new roads have been opened and
bridges constructed;-stage-coaches have been multiplied; -
gas-light, railroads, banks, libraries, Sabbath schools, infant and
charity schools, religious, charitable, and scientific associations
have been introduced;-agriculture has been conducted upon a
more enlightened system,-and the working of the coal mines has
been vastly extended.
  Suggestions.-The town should be thoroughly drained.  A por-
tion of the fields on the south-west of the town might be advan-
tageously laid out in small villas, suited to the accommodation of
genteel families, and at a moderate rent.  Improvements in ag-
riculture and manufactures, that supersede the necessity of
human labour, ought to be cautiously introduced ;-employ-
ments in greater variety, and yielding a better remuneration,
ought to be provided for female industry;-tbe education of the
young, especially among the lower orders, and their religious and-
moral training; and the health, habits, emloyment, and instruc-
tion of the adult poor and labouriDg classes, and their general
comfort and happiness, ought to receive more attention from the
upper and more influential parts of the community than they have
hitherto done.
