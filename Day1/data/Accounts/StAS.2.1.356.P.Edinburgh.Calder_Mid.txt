		  PARISH OF MID-CALDER.

	PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.*

	1.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundaries, &c.---CALDER is a common territorial ap-
pellation in Scotland, and always denotes some spot adjacent to
water, or rather to a rivulet. This name is of Celtic origin--Cal,
Cel, or Coil, being descriptive of wooded or wild regions; and Dur,
or Dour, signifying, water.
   The parish of Mid-Calder lies in the direction of north and
south; and, by the straightest footpath Or bridle road, from the
north-east to the south-west extremity of the parish, extends from
eleven to twelve miles in length. Its average breadth is from two
and a half to three miles; but, in one place, it does not extend above
three or four hundred yards. It is bounded on the north by the
parish of Uphall; on the south, by Linton; on the east, by the
united parishes of Kirknewton and East-Calder, together with
those of Currie and a small portion of Kirkliston; and, on the
west, by the parishes of West-Calder and Livingstone. By a sin-
gular coincidence, Liston Shields, the property of the late Sir
Robert Liston, which is situated on the south-east extremity of this
parish, belongs to Kirkliston, although it lies at the distance of
seven or eight miles from any other part of that parish. The ridge
of the Cairn hills forms the southern boundary of the parish, and
may be considered as a continuation of the Pentlands westward till
they reach the parish of West-Calder. There are no elevations
in this parish which can properly be called mountains. The eastern
Cairn Hill is the highest point; and, if Knox's map can be re-
lied upon, its summit is about 1800 feet above the medium level
of the sea. This spot commands a most extensive view of the
Frith and basin of the Forth, with the adjacent scenery towards
Stirling, the coast of Fife, and the Ochils. At the eastern extre-
