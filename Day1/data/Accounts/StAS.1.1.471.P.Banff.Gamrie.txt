   Sea Coast, and Fisheries.-On this coast a variety of different
kinds of fish are caught, viz ling, cod, hadcocks; whitings,
turbot, skate, &c. with which this country used to be re-
markably well supplied, and a considerable quantity of them,
when dried, were carried to the First of Forth, and sold there.
From the best information, it appears that the fishermen in
this parish have sometimes received for their salt fish L. 250
annually.  Of late years, the fishing has been so remarkably
poor, (to what cause it is perhaps difficult to say, but most
likely one principal reason is, the immense quantities of sea-
dogs, 2 kind of shark, with which this coast has been in-
sested), that there has hardly been fish sufficient to supply
the markets at home.  Of consequence, it is to be supposed
they have risen much in value.  Long after the present minis-
ter was settled in the parish, he could have purchased haddocks
at one penny and three half-pence a dozen, which now cost a
shilling to eighteen pence; and in proportion for other kinds
of fish, and every other article of food.  On this coast, great
quantities of sea weed, called ware, are thrown up on the
shore, which the farmers lay on the ground, and find very
profitable in raising crops of barley.  In this parish, it is laid
on with a very sparing hand, owing to the steepness of the
coast, and the bad access to the shore.  Considerable quan-
tities also of this sea-weed are cut off from the rocks,
for the purpose of making kelp.  At an average, about 30
tons are made annually, which sell from L. 3 to L. 5
a ton.  On the river Dovern, which separates the pa-
rishes of Banff and Gamrie, is an exceeding good sal-
mon fishery, the property of Lord Fife, which lets for
