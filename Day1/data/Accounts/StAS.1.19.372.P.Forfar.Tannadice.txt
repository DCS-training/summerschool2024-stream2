     PARISH OF TANNADICE,

     (County of Forfar, Synod of Angus and Mearns,
Presbytery of Forfar).

     By John Jamieson, D.D. Forfar.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   There is no evidence that the name of this parish has
been changed.  The more ancient orthography is
Tannadys or Tannadyse.  This name is most probably of
Gaelic origin.
   It needs scarcely to be observed, that this parish is situ-
ated in the county of Forfar, in the presbytery of Forfar,
and in the synod of Angus and Mearns.  It extends about
twelve English miles from E. to W.; in some places it is
eight or ten miles broad; but, at an average, about four.
It is bounded by the parish of Cortachie on the W.; by
Outhlaw and Aberlemno on the S.; by Fern and Carrald-
stone on the E.; and by Fern and Lethnot on the N.
