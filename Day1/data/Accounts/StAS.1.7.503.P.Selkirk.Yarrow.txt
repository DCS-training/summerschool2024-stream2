experiment, from an idea that their lambs could not sustain
the spring colds and storms to which their farms are subject.
That their farms are in a high elevation, and greatly exposed
to the winter storms, and the spring blasts, is beyond all
controversy:  But, whether their fears and apprehensions
upon this head are well grounded, remains yet to be pro-

been prevented from rearing the Cheviot breed, by long
established habits or groundless fears, will soon surmount
these, and concur with spirit and vigour in forwarding the
improvement of the staple commodity of the country, which
tends both to promote the prosperity of the nations and to
advance the interest of individuals.

The wild consist of the partridge, moorfowl, hawk, crow,
wood-pigeon, thrush, blackbird, bullfinch, lark, linnet, and
the sparrow.  The migratory may be reduced to the lapwing,

swans have also made their appearance in the lochs already

From a survey of the parish taken this year, the inhabitants
amount to 1230.  Of these, 584 are males, and 646 are re-
