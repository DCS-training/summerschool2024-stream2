perpendicular, are placed horizontally, and not near the dis-
tance from one another which the law directs.  Neither is
there any Saturday's slap, (opening of the works), observed
during the fishing season, by which means not a single fish can
get up till the legal time, 26th August, expires.  And even
after it expires, these destructive works are kept up for 3 or
4 weeks successively.  Hence not only the fisheries below, but
also the property of those gentlemen, who have considerable
estates higher up the river, and by their charter have a right
to fish, are essentially injured.  Some people here pretend
to say, that the same number of fish are always found to re-
turn annually into the river, notwithstanding the immense
quantities which are yearly taken.  But this, it may be pre-
sumed, is just as absurd, as if one should assert, that though
you were to destroy 40 out of 50 breeders, you would still
have as many produced next season from the 10, as you had
the preceding year from the 50 breeders.

   Harbour.-The harbour of Kirkcudbright is situated on
the N. of the Solway Frith, about 10 leagues N. E. of the
Isle of Man, and 7 leagues N. W. of St. Bee's Head, in Eng-
land.  It is a safe, natural harbour, with good anchorage
and shelter from all winds.  There is no harbour in the S.
coast of Scotland superior to it; but, being a dry harbour, it
is fit only for such vessels as can take the ground.  At the
mouth of it there is an island called Little Ross.  The en-
trance between this and the E. shore is about 1 1/2 mile.  It is
safe and bold on both sides.  About 200 or 300 yards N. E.
of this island lies the proper road for vessels to anchor, where
they ride in perfect safety, unless the wind sets in from S. W.
by S. to S. S. E.; and even then, if it does not blow a very
hard gale.  In this road there is a depth of 16 feet at low water,
and 40 at high water, the rise being about 24 feet.  At half
