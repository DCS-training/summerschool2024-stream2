twixt the eastern and western seas, is not liable to incessant
rains; but, from its being surrounded with very high hills,
it is not only accustomed to an early fall of snow, but it is 
in the remembrance of many persons now in life, to have
seen the country for 6, 8 and 9 weeks, in such a state that
not tuft of heather was to be seen.  It is true, this has not
been the case for seven or eight years by gone, but who can
venture to say that these seasons may not again recur; and
subsist its present immense flock of the woolly species for
one week, the question is, in that event, in what manner
they can be preserved from starvation?

   Soil.-The soil in this parish is of different qualities; that
in Abertarf consists, in the surface, of light black mould, but
sandy in the bottom; and in most years, from the great
moisture issuing from the rains and vapours, to which that
part of the parish is generally liable, the growth of corn and
grass is very abundant; but except early crops, it is very
seldom got safely secured.  In Stratherrick, except in the
few farms on the banks of Lochness, the soil is of a quality
nearly approximating to moss.  On the south side of teh
country it is generally observed that the surface is not above
a foot or 18 inches from the chingle; on the north, from
two to three feet deep; but as the whole united parish is in-
tersected by a variety of rivers, the lands on the banks
therof are frequently found to contain abundance of clay,
which in many places is very near the surface; and as these
rivers are permitted to flow in their natural direction, with-
out any interruption, they frequently inundate the neigh-
bouring plains, and often lacerate and demolish those parts
thereof contiguous to them; and when these overflows hap-
pen in the winter or spring seasons, before the crop is sown,
the effect thereof is greatly to ameliorate vegetation, and
