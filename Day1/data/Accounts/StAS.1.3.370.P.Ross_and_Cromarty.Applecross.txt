     Statistical Account

   Extent.- The extent of the parish, is considerable, but
cannot, with precision, be ascertained as there is neither
public road nor bridge, from one extremity of it to the other.
The foot traveller is guided, according to the season of the year,
what course to take, over rugged hills, rapid waters, and deep
and marshy moors.  Besides here, as in all the adjoining pa-
rishes and Westhern Isles, the computation of miles is merely
arbitrary, always terminated by a burn, cairn, well, or some
such accidental mark, which renders them to remarkably un-

of sea coast, taking it in a direct line, by the opening of every

hilly, rocky,and mountainous.  Yet amidst these hills, cover-
ed with heath and dreary to the sight, are vallies bot beauti-

   Climate and Crop.- The climate like the surface of the
country, is remarkably unequal.  The same day is often di-

though occasionally we may have some tracts of dry weather,
yet at no period can two successive days be wholly depended
on.  The husbandman hath, in all operations, the cli-
