   Ecclesiastical State.-The few following facts will shew
the ecclesiastical state of Collace, as far as it is necessary to 
be exhibited in a work of this nature.  The church, an old
and indifferent fabric, stands on a rising ground, about a mile
westward of Dunsinnan hill.  The manse and offices, neat,
handsome, and commodious, were built A.D. 1778, on a 
new site, nearer the church than the former manse, which is
in the village of Collace.  The stipend is 73 bolls victual,
and L.5: 11: 1 1/2 Sterling, with a glebe of 7 1/2 acres.  The
names of the ministers, since the commencement of this cen-
tury, are, Mr Smith, Mr Ramsay settled A.D. 1713; Mr
Faichney 1739; Mr Kilgour, 1774; Mr Baird, 1778; Mr
Maclieth, 1783.

   Poor.-In 1783, the poor's funds did not exceed L.84;
at present they are L. 141, 14 s.  The poor are supported
by collections in the church, most-cloth money, and some
seat-rents; the annual amount of all which may be L. 15 
Sterling.

   Quarries and Roads.-A quarry, in the village of Col-
lace, was supposed, for many years, to have been exhausted;
but workmen lately employed to explore it, found a bed of
excellent free-stone; and appearances indicate abundance of
the same valuable article in other parts of the parish.  The
great turnpike-road from Perth to Cupar traverses this
parish, in an oblique direction.  Other roads are repaired
by statute-labour, converted into money, at the rate of 8 s.
or 12 s. for every plough.
