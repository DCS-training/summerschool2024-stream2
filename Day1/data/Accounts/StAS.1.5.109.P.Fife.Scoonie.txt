the sea.  It abounds with excellent trout of various kinds;
and at the mouth of the river, there is a salmon fishing, which
belongs to the estate of Durie.  The greatest part of the 
salmon caught here is carried over land to Perth, or New-
burgh, where they are shipped for the London market.  On
this river there are from 36 to 40 mills, of different descrip-
tions, within the space of 11 or 12 miles.

   Of deaths no accurate register can be kept, the dead be-
ing interred in different burying grounds in the neighbour-
hood, and no account given of them.  It is to be observed,
that the number of births and marriages has not increased
in proportion to the increase of the gross number; which
must therefore be ascribed to the great influx of young
people, of late years, employed in the manufactures.  Of the
whole inhabitants, there are not above 150 separatists from
the established church, of whom nearly the one half are
Burgher Seceders; 35 Antiburghers; 34 of the Relief So-
ciety; 2 Independents, and 3 Episcopalians.
