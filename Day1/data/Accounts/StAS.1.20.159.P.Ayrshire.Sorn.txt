it is said, an augmentation of the glebes might have been
easily procured; but this advantage the commissioners ne-
glected to secure.  The value of land in Scotland was then
so low, that, under the chagrin which they felt from their
failure in the main object, they probably thought a small
augmentation of glebes was a boon not worth soliciting, or
accepting.  How much are circumstances now changed? and
how differently would their successors act in a similar situa-

   Mr Steel, unwilling, perhaps, to return to his native land,
after the total overthrow of his favourite scheme, readily
accepted an invitation from the Protestant Dissenters to be-
come a preacher at Salter's Hall, London, where he soon after
fell into a consumption, of which he died.  He was succeeded,

thing of the kind in this county.  The late Mr Connel,
however, having a large family, added to the west end of it
a handsome wing of one floor, with a slated roof; and,
soon after the settlement of the present incumbent, the heri-
tors added another, at the east end, corresponding with
it.  These additions, joined to the beauty of its situation,
and the interior repairs and improvements which it has
lately received, chiefly at the expence of the incumbent,
have rendered it both a commodious and a pleasant habita-
