to the heart and understanding of many noble and respect-
able individuals.  Liberal subscriptions have been made; and
villages are now a building, for the purpose of introducing
arts, manufactures, and industry, into that depressed and ne-
glected corner of the kingdom.  But this very patriotic de-
sign will, in a great measure, be frustrated, by the scarcity of
fuel, or the labour that must be bestowed upon it.  The pro-

materials to burn lime; and manufactures, under this parti-
cular disadvantage, can never flourish; for it is well known,
that meal, at a moderate price, and fuel easily procured, are
two things necessary for their encouragement in this country.
-A canal across the neck of land, between Crinan and
Lochgilphead, would greatly improve the above advantage,
by rendering the provision of fuel more certain, and less ex-

would give to trade in the Highlands and Isles, will appear
in a strong light, by just remarking the labour and perseve-
