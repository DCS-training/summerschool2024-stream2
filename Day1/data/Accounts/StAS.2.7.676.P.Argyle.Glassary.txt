small lake, called Lochan Leamhan, near its centre. It also varies
the character of the parish scenery, by terminating or interrupting
the extensive tract of hill and moss which reaches from the shores
of Lochfyne to those of Lochawe.
   Meteorology.-The weather in this parish is of that changeable
character which its geographical situation indicates. The prevail-
ing winds are from southwest to west and northwest, and coming
from the Atlantic charged with vapour, which is formed into clouds
by contact with the mountains, they fail not to supply rain abun-
dantly. It is remarked, however, that when a south-west wind
continues for some time, it is accnmpanied by the finest and most
settled weather. When the wind is north-east, the weather is al-
most always dry, though often cloudy and cold. A daily register
Of the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere is kept at Kil-
mory, the residence of Sir John P. Orde, Bart. From observations
made for several year's with the rain-gauge in that place, the quan-
tity which falls annually may be considered to be from 60 to 70
inches.

Quantity of rain, as ascertained by the Rain-Gauge on the leads
of Kilmory House, * in the parish of Glassary, for the years
1835-6-7.
