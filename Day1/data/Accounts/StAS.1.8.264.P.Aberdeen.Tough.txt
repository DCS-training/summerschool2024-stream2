beautiful bason, which the proprietor has filled with water,
There are, in this bason, 3 or 4 rising grounds, which the wa-

wood and shrubbery.  From many points of view, this forms

sale, there is no saying how, or when it will be finally settled.
The valued rent of the parish is 1670 L. 14 s. Scotch.  The

months ago, amounted to 560.  Of these, there were,-
