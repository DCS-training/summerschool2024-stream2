     Statistical Account

this navigation have hitherto been greatly circumscribed; but
there is reason to believe that they will now be felt more sen-
sibly, on account of the certain increase of the coal trade,
and the probability, of other commercial operations.  The
present tonnage is only 6 d. per cart of 12 cwt. although the
proprietors have a right to levy 2 d. per tun each mile.  Coals
are delivered at Glasgow, by this conveyance, 3 d. lower per
cart, than at any coal work around the city.
   This immense undertaking begins to enhance the value of
the adjacent land, as lime and dung can be brought by the
vessels which convey the coat.  Mr Stirling brings about
3000 carts yearly to his own estate.  There are also various
other productions, as iron-stone, which may be turned out to
advantage, and several favourable situations for cotton machi-
nery.  Next summer Mr Stirling means to establish a track-
boat, which will be a pleasant mode of conveyance to Glas-
gow.  Besides its own proper advantages, the Monkland Ca-
nal affords a convenient aqueduct to the Forth and Clyde na-
vigation, by conveying water from the reservoirs in the
higher parts of the country.
   The chief supply of water is from the Calder, which is
conducted into it by a dam at Woodhall mill; it never
fails in the driest season.  This plentiful resource, which can
be increased to double the quantity, at the very highest part
of the country, with many other favourable circumstaces,
open an inviting track for the extension of the canal to Eden-
burgh, a plan at present in agitation, and which, when exe-
cuted, will be productive of innumerable benefits to the coun-
try.  The track that has been surveyed, south of the Shotts
hill, rises 522 feet above the height of the present canal, and
betwixt Edinburgh and Glasgow is 0 miles.  But a prefer-
able track can be found north of the Shotts hills, which rises
not so high by 140 feet, and is 10 miles shorter.  A pardi-
