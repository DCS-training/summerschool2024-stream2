raw material, so that from L. 70,000 to L. 80,000 Sterling
is laid out on labour for foreign consumpt.
   About 400 persons are employed in wool-combing, and
30,000 occasionally employed in spinning and knitting.  It
is said occasionally employed, because a great proportion of
these are frequently otherwise occupied, particularly at har-
vest, at moss, and in the summer season, providing some
pieces of clothing for themselves or families.
   The advantages peculiar to this branch of manufacture
are, that children at the age of ten, and people very far ad-
vanced in life, may, and often do, though in a scanty mea-
sure, maintain themselves by their labour at this work, and
the knitting can be carried on while travelling or watching
cattle or the like; nor does it require much, or at least not
constant light, many carrying on their work throughout
the winter evening, with the faintest light issuing from a
few turfs,-a circumstance much in favour of a country
where the nights are long, and the inhabitants poorly sup-
plied with fuel or light.  From these circumstances, per-
haps, it is, that the stocking manufacture finds hands, and
has its work done at a lower rate than some other
branches of manufactures, a good knitter not being able to
earn more than 2 s. per week, and the average not exceed-
ing 1 s. 6 d.
   There are a few stocking-frames in Aberdeen, but no-
thing considerable is done in that way.
   When speaking of the extent of the stocking manufac-
ture of Aberdeenshire, it must be understood, that what is
manufactured in the adjacent parts of the shire of Mearns,
to the distance of 12 or 15 miles on the coast, is included,
as all that trade centers in the city of Aberdeen, and is
carried on by the merchants and manufacturers residing
there.
