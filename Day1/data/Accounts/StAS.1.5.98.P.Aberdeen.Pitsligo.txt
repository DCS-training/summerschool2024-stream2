with slaughter a great way along the coast, where several
such tumuli are still be seen.

   Trees.-It has been a generally received opinion, that
trees will not grow in this neighbourhood, by reason of the
sea spray being hurtful to their vegetation; but with more
probability, because of the N. W. winds, which sweep the
whole face of the country, and check them in their growth.
Yet it is certain, that the greatest part of this country must
have been once covered with wood, as appears from the
roots of very large oaks, still existing in mosses nigh the
coast.  Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo has planted, within
these few years, a piece of ground with forest trees of all
kinds, adjoining to the old house or castle of Pitsligo, and

very well.  And this experiment will probably determine,

   Manufactures, Filberies, etc.-A considerable quantity of
kelp is made upon the shore of this parish, which is about
3 1/2 miles in extent.  At the distance of half a mile from its
eastern extremity, is the fishing town of Pittaly, belonging
to Sir William Forbes, which contains 23 houses, and 116
inhabitants.  It sends 4 fishing boats to sea, with 6 men in
each.  Two miles further west is the fishing town of Rose-

in each.  From autumn to the end of January, haddocks
are the most valuable fish, being then in greatest perfection.
When bought upon the shore, they cost 1 s. the dozen,
though 4 years ago, they were sold at 6 d.  This rise in the
price is ascribed to the greater scarcity of fish, to their being
