bandry; but is not much interfered with in his mode of manage-
ment, unless when some unfair dealing appears.
	Produce.--It is somewhat difficult to state correctly the gross
value of the produce of this parish, as the land in different loca-
lities varies so much in quality and value; but the following may
be taken as not far from a fair estimate of the annual average
amount of produce of the arable land:--

<TABLE>
5487 acres of oats, at 4 1/2 quarters per acre--24,691 1/2 quarters,
        at L. 1, 8s 3 10/12d.*                                               L. 34,962   9  6 4/12
 322 do. of barley, at 4 4/2 qrs. per do.--1449 qrs., at L. 1, 9s. 11 1/2d.       2303   6  1 6/12
1936 1.2 do. of hay, at 130 stones per do.--251,745 st., at 7d. per st.           7342  11  3
3873 do. of pasture, at L. I per acre,                                            3873   0  0
 163 1/2 do. of potatoes, at L.7, 10s. per acre,                                  1226   5  0
1773 do. of turnips, at L. 5 per acre,                                            8865   0  0

                                                                              L. 58,572 11 10 10/12
	This amount, large as it seems to be, when applied in payment
of rent, wages, and maintenance of servants and labourers, trades-
men's bills, interest of capital invested, and wasting of capital for
tear and wear, for manure and seed, and for oats, hay, and grass for
horses and cattle, &c. &c., must, we fear, present such a result as
to show that the profits of the agriculturists are not so great as at
first sigbt might appear, or their condition so prosperous, as, for
the best interests of the country, the philanthropist could desire.
One consequence of which has been, that, within these few years,
six of our enterprising farmers in this parish have abandoned their
leases, and are now engaged in various pursuits in the far distant
west; three of them superintending or connected with trading com-
panies established by British capital, and three of them in com-
mercial and agricultural undertakings in different parts of the
United American States.
	Dairy.--The dairy is an object of considerable interest and
importance on some of the principal farms. Little cheese is
made; butter is of excellent quality, though of late the quan-
tity is not so great as formerly, from the practice now fre-
quently pursued of allowing the calves to be suckled at their
mother's foot, instead of receiving milk from the dairy-maid's
hand. The butter, except what is required at home, or prepared

	* The calculation is, for common oats, with fodder, at the average flar prices of
the county for years from 1834 to 1840 inclusive, and for bear from 1834 to 1840
inclusive, with the exception of 1836, for which no price of bear with fodder was
struck.
	Since the commencement of the current leases, a considerable quantity of waste
land has been brought under the plough, which, althouch it cannot, till the terminal,
tion of these leases, add to the rental, has materially increased the produce of the
parish.
