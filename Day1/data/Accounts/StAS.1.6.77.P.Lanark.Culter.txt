     of Culter.

7, of whom 3 reside principally in the parish.  The people
are in general commodiously lodged, the proprietors having
built substantial farm-houses for their tenants.  More flax is
raised here than in any part of the neighbouring coun-
try, and the soil is very proper for that crop.  People from a
considerable distance will chearfully pay 2 s. 6 d. for as much
land as is requisite for fowing a cap-full, or forpet of seed, 40 of
which measures are allotted to an acre: each forpet generally
produces from 12 to 25 lb. of dressed flax from the mill.-The
harvest is in general earlier by a week than in other parish in
the vicinity.-The air in the southern part of this district, is
very sharp in winter, the hills being generally covered with
snow; while the inhabitants in the lowland places enjoy a clear
and dry air.  Culter-water, which falls into the Clyde, after
bisecting the parish, abounds with trout.

   Population, etc. The state of the parish, as to population,
