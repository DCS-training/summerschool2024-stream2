	Total for enrolled poor,         L. 47 10  0

Besides the enrolled poor, it is frequently necessary to extend the
assistance of the session to indigent individuals, who, from qickness
or other causes, fall into temporary want; but the whole sum year-
ly expended by the session (exclusive of extraordinary demands in
years of scarcity) does not amount to more than L.54 or L.55 a-
year.
	To meet this expenditure, the church collections amount to
about L.25 yearly,--a sum by no means small when the nature of
the population is considered, which is entirely agricultural.  The
heritors supply the remainder on the private application of the mi-
nister, by an annual contribution, altogether voluntary, without any
stated meetings, or any nice adjustment of their subscriptions, to
the relative value of their property in the parish. Indeed, of the
five heritors by whom tbe.whole land of the parish is possessed,
two contribute very little to the support of the poor; the kirk-
session choosing rather to throw themselves on the generosity
and good sense, of those who are willing to give, than, by calling
legal meetings, to bring a permanent and necessarily increasing
poor rate on the parish, with all its demoralizing consequences.
	A practice used formerly to prevail in this parish, and is still
customary in the neighbourhood, of raising a small sum for the re-
lief of a poor family, by means of what is called a, drinking--a
kind of rustic ball, for which whisky and other refreshments were
	DUMFRIES.
