ground being so smooth, and at the same time so very dry,
that at all seasons a cart may be drawn to every arable spot
in it, unless when it is covered with snow.*
   The dryness of the soil, enables the farmers to begin and
end their seed-time sooner than in other parishes.  Their oats
are generally sown in February and March, and their bear in
April.  Their harvest often begins in August, and is ended
with September.
   Their meadow and pasture grounds are very extensive.
The tenants in these parishes are supposed to have at present
about 1000 milch cows, and as many oxen and young cattle.
In the hills they have from 9000 to 10,000 sheep, and from
600 to 700 horses and mares.

   Rents, and State of Property.-In these parishes there are

parishes, it will not measure above half a Scots acre, yet so much
does it exceed the Scots acre in others, that the whole of the
arable land cannot be less than 1600 acres.-The rents are paid
in so many different articles, that it is not easy to ascertain their
amount.  Some of the heritors have of late converted these
articles into a money payment; and, where this is the case,
the tenants pay from 10 s. to 12 s. the merk, exclusive of the
minister's stipend and other public burdens.-So fluctuating
has been the state of property in these parishes, that, though
they belong to 34 different heritors, there are not above 200
merks of land in the possession of the same families they
belonged to 36 years ago.  On this account, it may not be
