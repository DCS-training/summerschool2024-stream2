     Statistical Account

   Roads.-The post road is supported by the money raised at
the different toll bars, which are this year set for L. 981 Ster-
ling.  The bye roads are repaired by the statute labour, un-
der the direction of the heritors of the parishes where they
are situated.  By act of parliament, the trustees have power to
convert the statute work into money; the composition usually
taken is 20 s Sterling for each ploughgate of land, and 1 s 6 d
from each householder who possessts a house not under 20 s of
rent; but though this amounts to a very considerable sum, yet
many of the bye roads are in very bad repair, owing to the na-
ture of the soil, which is generally clayey, and to the great
scarcity of materials in many parts of the country.
   Miscellaneous Observations.-John Knox, the famous refor-
mer, was a native of Haddington; the house in the Gifford-
gate, in which he was born, still remains.  The illustrious fa-
mily of Maitland was for many ages seated at Leithington, in
this parish, where the famous Duke of Lauderdale was born
in 1616; several of that family are interred in Haddington
church, particularly John Maitland, baron of Thirlstane, Lord
High Chancellor of Scotland, whose monument is graced
with an epitaph, composed by his royal master James VI.
Amisfield house, in this parish, the property of the Earl of
Wemyss, is a capital modern building, the body is 109 feet in
length by 77 in depth; the galllery contains many fine paint-
ings, some of them by the first masters:  particularly Ver-
tumnus and Pomona, by Rubens, for which the proprietor
has been offered 800 guineas*.
