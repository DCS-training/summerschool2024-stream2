were three of these till lately. There is at present only one; it is
in the village of Joppa, and attended by fifty at an average. The
teacher has a free school-room, but otherwise depends entirely on
the school fees. There is cause to regret, that some do not see
the necessity of keeping their children at school a sufficient length
of time, and with constancy, during that period of life, when the
difficulties of learning are most easily overcome. The profits aris-
ing from the work of children in the fields and coal mines, and from
service, are temptations which we fear are sometimes yielded to,
when the plea of necessity can scarcely be urged. The parish
teacher has L. 30 of salary, the legal accommodation, and statutory
extent of garden ground.
	All the native population can read; but there are a few from
the sister island, who unhappily have not this invaluable art; most
of these, however, show a laudable zeal for the education of their
children; and Roman Catholic, parents evince no reluctance to
send their children to our schools.
	There are two Sabbath schools,--one kept in the church, the
other in Joppa. A village library was set on foot a few years ago,
but the number of volumes is yet very limited.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of paupers, reckoning
children as well as parents and adults, on the permanent roll, in
the year 1835, 1836, and 1837, and the total amount distributed
to them, each year, are as follows:

Those here mentioned, only get coals at the beginning of the year
to the amount specified, but cannot be viewed as paupers,--never
having applied for parochial relief. An assessment is occasionally
levied. It is paid solely by the heritors according to their valued
rent, and raised by the session-clerk at a varying per centage. The
first assessment was in 1817. The sum usually raised is L. 20.
This was not always required annually.
	The average collections for the three years preceding the as-
sessment in 1817 was, for 1813, 1814, and 1815, L. 39, 13s. 9d;
for 1835, 1836, and 1837, L. 59, 11s. 9d.
