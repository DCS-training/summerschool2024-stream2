Dumfriesshire.  It is long and narrow, lying between
the parishes of Glencairn and Penpont: Glencairn run-
ning along the S. W. side about 8 Scotch miles; Penpont
upon the N. E. side about 9 miles.  The parish of Keir
is a boundary at the lower end; and at the N. W., or
uppermost, it touches the parish of Dalry, lying in the
stewartry of Galloway.  It is generally computed to be
10 Scotch miles in length, and about 2 1/2 in breadth, at an
average.  The greatest part of the parish is a strath,
little valley ground and hills rising up on both hands.
The hills are mostly green, and being well clothed with
grass, are remarkable for feeding a larger number of
sheep than the same quantity of land in any strath
around.  The greatest part of the parish is chiefly cal-
culated for raising and feeding of sheep: although, of
late years, the tillage of lands has considerably increas-
ed, on account of the neighbouring lime-works of Close-
burn and Barjarg, which have been carried on with spi-
rit and success.  The soil is rather thin and sandy, and,
from the greater part of the arable lands being situated
on the edge of hills, the crops are neither luxuriant nor
early.  Oats are chiefly raised.  Potatoes also in great
abundance.  There is a considerable quantity more of
grain than is equal to supply the inhabitants.  Since
the large demands have commenced for black cattle in
England, the landholders have been encouraged to raise
them in greater quantities.  And those farms which fed
sheep only about 40 or 50 years ago, feed now some
black cattle also upon their lowest lands, where the grass
is strongest, and most shelter to be found.  The farmer
finds his interest in this mode of management, as, in this
way, he seldom misses of drawing considerable profits
from one part of his stock, agreeable to what is most
