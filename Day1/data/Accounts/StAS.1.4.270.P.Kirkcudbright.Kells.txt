their own peat, and though brought home on horses backs,
as the distance is short, have sufficient fuel at a very trisling
expence.  Much coal is used by the better fort, brought in
carts from Dalmellington, near 20 miles distant.  Though
New Galloway is finely situated for a woollen manufacture,
the difficulty of finding fuel has hitherto discouraged the
manufacturer from fixing there, and hindered both the
increase and improvement of the burgh.  But now when
roads are opening up, and mosses rendered accessible to
carts, both the expence and difficulty will be lessened; for
a cart with 1 horse will carry as many as 7 horses on their
backs.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are of the com-
mon size, between 5 feet 7 inches, and 6 feet, rather stronger
made, and of a more rosy and better complexion than those
in the low country; owing, perhaps, to their not being
accustomed to such hard labour, to their living better, and

of late years exchanged, owing partly to the failure of the
Douglas and Heron Bank, which has much distressed this
part of the country, and partly to other causes.  It sold at
between 24 and 30 years purchase.-Since 1780, when the
act of Parliament was obtained for conversion of the statute-
labour, high-roads have been made and repaired by assess-
ments on the parish, not exceeding L. 1 the L. 100 of valu-
ation.  Yet this is so inadequate to the making and repair-
ing extensive roads, that many of them are still in bad or-
