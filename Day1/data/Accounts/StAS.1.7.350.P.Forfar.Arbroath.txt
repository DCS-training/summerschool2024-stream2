   Climate, etc.-The air is dry and salubrious.-The people
in general healthy.  About 20 years ago, intermittent fevers
were very prevalent, particularly during the spring months;
but since the lands in the neighbourhood, in consequence of
a keen spirit for agriculture, have been drained of their exu-
berant latent moisture, the disease has totally disappeared.
Continued fevers, which used rarely to occur, have been more
frequent within these last two years; they are of a type be-
tween the nervous and inflammatory, and seldom prove fatal.
They probably owe their existence to our winters having
been uncommonly open and moist.  Comparatively speaking,
Arbroath is a remarkably healthy place, and the people live
to a good old age.  There are many of 70 and 80, and a few
considerably above 90 years.  I know five persons whose ages
added together make 476; one of these is an old woman a-
ged 97, yet strong and healthy, who never drank a dram.
Another of them is an old man aged 96, whose wife, not in-
cluded in the above number, is 85.-She is the man's third
wife, and he is her third husband.  Prejudices against ino-
culation for the small pox are almost entirely eradicated.

   Mineral Spring.-About a quarter of a mile to the west-
ward of the town, in a high ground called the Common,
there is one of the strongest Spaws, or Chalybeate springs, in
Scotland.  It is much frequented by people affected with
scrophula, nervous, and stomachic disorders, and other disea-
ses arising from relaxation of the habit; and in numberess
cases, the medical practitioners are obliged to acknowledge
the superior effect of the water, as a corroborant to any re-
medy they can prescribe.   Probably this spring would be
more frequented, if there were some attention paid to the
well, and proper accommodations for the reception of its vi-
sitors.  An inducement to the invalid to repair to this place,
