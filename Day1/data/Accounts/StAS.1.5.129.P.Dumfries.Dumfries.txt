the raising of the rents have all concurred to produce this
gradual rise on the price of provisions.

   A pound of beef, of 16 ounces, is sold from 3 d. to 5 d.;
mutton 3 d. to 4 1/2 d.; veal 3 d. to 4 1/2 d. lamb 3 d.; pork 3 d.
to 4 d. to geese, each, from 1 s.6 d.to 2 s. 6 d.; ducks, from
6 d. to 8 d.; a pair of chickens, 7 d. to 8 d.; a pound of butter,
24 ounces, 7 d. to 9 d.; Scotch cheese, 3 d.  The fiars of this
county are struck by the peck.  At an average for the six years
ending in 1790, from the statements in the books of the
Sheriff clerk, the value of the peck of wheat is 4 s.; of 
baley 2 s. 9 d.; of oats 1 s. 10 d.  The Dumfries peck of
oats and barley is accounted better than the Winchester
bushel.  The same measure of wheat one third less.  The
Winchester bushel of the best wheat weighs 60 lb. of 16
ounces each; barley 52 lb.; and oats 38.  The Dumfries
peck of wheat weighs only 45 lb.

   rices of Labour.-A labourer's wages are 1 s. a-day; for
a few months in winter, he receives 2 d. or 3 d. less.  Car-
penters and masons have from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s.; tailors 6 d. and
their victuals.  Till within these very few years, the wages
of carpenters, masons, bricklayers and slaters were 2 d. a-
day less than at present.  This rise has been occasional, in
a great measure, by the building of a number of new houses
in the neighbourhood within these few years.

   Fuel.-The fuel used is coals from Sanquhar, or by water
carriage from Cumberland, and peats from Locher-moss.
The coals cost from 7 d. to 9 d. per cwt, and are, after all,
a cheaper article of fuel than the peats.

   Servant's Wages.-A ploughman's wages are from 7 to
8 guineas a-year, with his board.  Dairy maids have L. 3
