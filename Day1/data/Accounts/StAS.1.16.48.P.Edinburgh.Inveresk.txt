   Constitution.-The same objections lie against the constitution
of this burgh, as against many other burghs of Scot-
land, viz. that they are liable to an oligarcby, and that it is
impracticable, as the law now stands, for the burgesses to 
obtain any redress for the mismanagement of the public revenue;
and they are attended with the same ill consequences

or goverment of a few, which is apt to extinguish in
the holders of it every idea but that of preserving
their own power; and obliges them, for this purpose,
to elect into their body insignificant people, or up-
