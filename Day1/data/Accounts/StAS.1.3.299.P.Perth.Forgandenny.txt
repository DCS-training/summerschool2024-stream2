     of Forgandenny.

   Surface.-The appearance of the country is various.  The
parish may be divided into two parts, the upper and the
lower.  The lower division, though it rises gradually to the
foot of the hills, is upon the whole a champaign country:
the upper is hilly, being part of those hills which are called
the Ochils.  In the upper, or hilly part, there are frequent
rocks, yet it cannot from them be denominated rocky, most
of those hills being covered with grass, and some parts of
them with heath, sorze, and broom.

   Soil.-In the hilly part, the foil consists of reddish clay,
black earth, and sand.  It is for the most part light, and
better fitted for producing oats, than any other sort of grain;
and these it produces in great abundance.  In the lower part
the soil likewise varies.  The meadows, by the side of the
Earn are sandy.  The grounds above them consist chiefly of
rich black earth, and clay.  The meadows, both by the sides
of the Earn, and of the May, a small river, which runs
through the hills, produce plenty of excellent flax.  And on
the black earth and clay are raised rich crops of barley, and
wheat, besides oats, clover, turnips, cabbages, and potatoes.
Much of the low part of the parish they call carse ground,
from its being the same sort of soil with the Carse of Gowry.
And, indeed, the Carse of Gowry seems to be but a continu-
ation of that extensive valley, which is called Strathearn.
That chain of hills which in Strathearn are called the
Ochills, and which bound the south side of the strath, run
from west to east through Fife, nearly as far as the mouth
of the Tay.  And the hilly ground which shelters Strathearn
on the north, is separated from those hills, which are called
the Brae of the Carse, only by the course of the Tay.  From
a high hill in the parish of Forgan, which they call Castle-
