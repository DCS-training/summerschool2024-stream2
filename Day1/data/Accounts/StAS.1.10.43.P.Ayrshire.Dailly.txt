   State of Landed Property.-No considerable property in land
has been sold in the parish for several years past; and almost
the whole has remained in the poss-ssion or the same families
for many generations.  The lands are at present divided, but in
very unequal portions, among eight proprietors; five of whom
usually reside in the parish; viz. Mr Hamilton of Bargeny,
Sir Adam Fergusson of Kilkerran, Sir Andrew Cathcart.
of Carleton; Mr Kennedy of Dunure, and Captain Ken-
nedy of Drummelland.  All of these gentlemen inherit more
extensive landed property elsewhere; but their ancestors, pro-

Sir Adam Fergusson, and his father the late Lord Kilkerran,
in this parish, and within the contiguous borders of Kirkoswald
and Maybole, cover about 400 Scots acres.  Those on the lands
of Dalquharran occupy 127 acres, and have been made chief-
ly by the present proprietor Mr Kennedy.  This gentleman
has lately built a very magnificent house in the modern castle
style, on a plan of the late Mr Robert Adam.  The planta-
tions, as well as natural woods, on the other estates in the pa-
rish, are also considerable.

   Rent of Land.-The valued rent of the parish is 3265 L.
10 s. 6 d. Scotch.  The real rent has, as usual, kept pace with
the increase of wealth and progressive melioration of land.  In
1740, the annual rent of the whole parish scarcely amounted
to 1000 L. Sterling: and during 20 succeeding years, its rise
