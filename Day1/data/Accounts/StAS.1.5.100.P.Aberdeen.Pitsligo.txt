the best in the country; other parts of it are very indifferent,
so that it is not easy to ascertain the average rent.  The
best land, high the shore, where ware can easily be obtained,
is let at from 20 s. to 30 s. an acre.  Excepting one or two
farms in the south part of this  parish, the soil is not sit for
producing oats: it yields more profitable crops of barley and
beans, which last is prevailing generally; and a newly intro-

sown as early as the season will permit, commonly in the be-

which may be at the time.  Most farmers rear what horses
are necessary for themselves, but they do not pay so great at-
tention to the breeding of horses for sale, as of black cattle.
