     of Coldstream.

Coldstream is situated in the county of Berwick, presbyte-
ry of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Tiviotdale.  Pla-
cing the foot of a compass at Lennel church, taking 4 miles
for a radius, and the river Tweed as a diameter, a semi-
circle described on the north of that river will give a gene-
ral idea of the extent and form of the parish.  The length
from E. to W. is from 7 to 8 miles; and the breadth 4 miles
at an average.  Coldstream is bounded by Ladykirk on the
E. by Simprin (now united to Swinton) on the N. by
Eccles on the W.  The river Tweed is the southern boun-
dary.  The general appearance of the country is flat.  The
rising grounds in the parish do not deserve the name of
hills.-The soil for the most part is rich and fertile; near
the Tweed light; inclined to clay backwards.  A broad
slip of barren land runs through the parish from E. to W.
called the Moorland.-The air is in general dry and healthy.
Coldstream is situated at a considerable, and equal
distance from the Chiviot and Lammermoor hills.  When
the weather is showery, especially if the wind be westerly,
the clouds (from the west) take the direction of one or o-
ther of these hills, pour down their contents upon them,
and leave this parish untouched.  There is much more rain
at Dunse and Wooller than here.  According as the sum
mer is wet or dry, Coldstream is benefited or hurt by the
locality of its situation.  Agues prevail in some seasons,
but not regularly.  Headaches, tooaches, and nervous
complaints in general, are more frequent here than in other
places with which I have been acquainted.  Perhaps the
easterly fogs and rains, together with the frequent blowing
of the wind from that quarter, may be the causes of these
complaints.  In the village, the children of the poorer in-
habitants are liable to the scrophula.
