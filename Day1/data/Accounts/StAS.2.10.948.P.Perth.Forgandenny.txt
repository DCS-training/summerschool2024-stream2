contributions, whether from heritors or members of other congre-
gations, or from those who are but occasional hearers in the parish
church; 3d, the number of ordinary or stated paupers has consi-
derably lessened; and, lastly, the collections at the church door
have continued considerably to exceed the estimated probable
amount.  Average collections for the three years preceding the
imposing of assessment in 1824, L.47, 17s. 2 3/4d.; for the three
years following, L.29, 9s. 8d.; for the three years, 1839, 40, 41,
L.114, 0s. 7d.; average contributions by heritorr for do. L.65;
do. by parishioners attending other churches, or but occasional
bearers at Kinnoull, L.23; average mortcloth dues, proclama-
tions, &c. L.8, 15s.; highest rate of annual relief to paupers on
roll (exclusive of those in  Murray's Asylum), L.6, 16s. 6d.; low-
est, L.1, 11s. 6d. The average number of ordinary poor is now
reduced to 20; but there is a like number of orphan children upon
the roll.  Occasional relief is furnished to about 25 not on the
roll. Coals are distributed annually in January to about 60 of
those receiving permanent or occasional relief. The whole ex-
pense of management since 1831 bad been only L.5 annually, but
in 1840, the beritors augmented the allowance to the kirk trea-
surer, which is now L.10.
   It is to be hoped, that nothing may occur to mar the operation
of this scheme, which has already proved so successful.
