row building, rather old and incommdious*.

   The manse being very old, and insusfficient, a new and
more commodious one is about to be erected.

sterling.-The stipend is worth somewhat above L. 100.
An augmentation was lately obtained.-The Earl of Leven
is patron.

*The bell is on the east end of the church.  It was erected a-
bout 40 years ago, when the former one became insufficient: that
bell had been used from the days of Robert the Bruce, as appeared by
aninscription on it.  The church was new-roofed about 50 years ago.
