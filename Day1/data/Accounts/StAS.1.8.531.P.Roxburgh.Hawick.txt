the parish, a manse and garden, and a glebe of 15 English acres.
Besides the Established Church, there are two meeting-houses;
a Burgher and an Antiburgher.  The distance of many places,
in this and the adjacent parish of Cavers, from the parish
churches, induced the inhabitants there to erect a chapel of
ease.  In this place, under the direction of the ministers of
Hawick and Cavers, a chaplain performs divine service
partly paid by the Duke of Buccleugh, and partly by the
ministers and the people; but the assistant not being in or-
ders, little burden is thereby taken from the ministers, h e
number of poor, at present receiving weekly assistance, is
110: for their support, the heritors etc. assess themselves to the
amount of 370 L. per annum*.

*Besides this provision for the poor, a number have associated, under the
title of The Friendly Society, to support themselves in the time of sickness, or un-
der the infirmities of old age.  The members pay a trifle at their admission, and 4 s.
annually; and for this, when reduced by sickness or age, they receive 3 s. per
week; at the death of a member, his wife receives 1 L. 10 s., and a member, at
the death of his wife, 1 L., to defray the funeral expences.  Besides those who are
the immediate objects of this association, the society consists of many of the 10,
spectable inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood.
