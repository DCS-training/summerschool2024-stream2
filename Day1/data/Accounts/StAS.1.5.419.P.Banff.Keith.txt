     Among these, there are 312 Dissenters, including children,
of whom there are of the Associate Congregation,   131
Papist*,                                           122
Scotch Episcopalians,                               59
If the parish registers be exact, the average of births for the
following periods, are as under:
From January 1701, to ditto 1704, the average is,   39 1/3
From January 1743, to ditto 1746,                   91 2/3
From January 1770, to ditto 1773,                   65 2/3
From January 1787, to ditto 1790,                   62 1/3

   It is, however, to be observed, that few of the Dissenters
enter their childrens names in the parish registers.  The a-
verage of marriages for the last 3 years, is 14 2/3.  From the
above statement it appears, that since 1755, population in
Keith has increased upon the whole 374, but since 1783, it
has decreased 526.  Since the writer of this had the charge 
of the parish, or for three years back, it has decreased 90.
This may easily be accounted for, from the state of the ma-
nufactures.

   Manufactures.-The principal branches of manufacture
carried on in Keith are flax-dressing, spinning, and weaving.
The two first of these, during the above mentioned period,
have been in a very unprosperous condition; so much so,
that many flax-dressers have been dismissed by their em-
ployers, and, with their families, have left the place.  This

*It is observable, that the Papists have increased 92 since the year 1755.
This increase is not owing to new conversions, of which very few occur,
but to the migration of several Popish families from the Enzie, where, when
the family of Gordon, the superiors of that country, were Popish, they
greatly abounded, and where they are still very numerous.  There are no
instances of longevity, except as above.  It may, however be observed, 
that there is a couple yet alive, whose ages together make x71, and who
have now eaten 64 Christmas dinners together, since they were man and wife.
