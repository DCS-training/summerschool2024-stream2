     Statistical Account

The coffin, also, for ages back, has served the saint as a
treasury; and this, perhaps, might be the purpose for which
it was originally intended.  Till of late, not a stranger set

dropping a small coin into a sink between its cover and

   It was an unlucky business for the invalids of those days.
The faint granted her request, but was so scandalised by
the indelicacy of her language, that he became deaf to the 
prayers of his votaries ever after.
   The cave preserved its reputation till of late; and, but
for the following untoward accident, would have remained
an object of terror till this day.  A pair, more solicitous
