made up Wanchopedale next spring, to shorten the commu-
nication between Langholm, Lockerbie, and Eccfeschan,
and other places to the westward.  There is bridge of 3
arches over the Esk, where the road leading up into Esk-
dale begins, which unites the town and the village (or
New Town) on the W. side of the river.  It was built in
the year 1775, by subcriptionl.  A little way N. there is
another of a arches, upon the post-road over the Ewes.  They
stand nearly parallel, and are not above a gun-shot from
each other, the two rivers immediately uniting between
them.  About half a mile S. of Langholm, there is another
of 3 arches, which is supposed to be at least more than co-
eval with the current century.  Besides several smaller
arches, there are 3 other bridges, which do not merit any
particular notice.

   Rivers.-Having already had frequent occasion to men-
tion the rivers in this parish, it needs only farther to be ob-
served, that the Ewes, after intersecting the parish of that
name, runs about a mile through this parish, and inter-
mixes with the Esk, immediately before it passes below the
bridge that communicates with the village or New Town.
and that the Wauchope also joins it from the W. About a 
hundred yards below.  After floods, excellent salmon are
caught in the Esk; but the quantity, it is alleged, is
much diminished, by the obstruction they meet with from
the mound across the river at Netherbie, that conveys wa-
ter to Sir James Graham's mills; it may also be owing,
perhaps, to the salman-fisheries upon the Solway frith, to
which, of late years, great attention has been paid, and
which, of course, must diminish the quantity in the Esk, 
and in the other tributary rivers.  Suffice it to say, that
from the great quantities caught in both places, and sent
to York and London, little of it reaches Langholm market.
