well as Scotland, flocked to it.  So that it was finished in
the course of a few months.  The Scotch and Irish for the
most part, used the spade and wheel-barrow; and by their
amazing perseverance, working from sun rise, till sun set,
they made great wages, and greatly expedited the work.
But in wet weather they were much retarded.  The planks
became slippery, their spades and wheel-barrows were all clot-
ted over with mud and clay, so as to become very cumber-
some.  Though they excelled the English at other times, by
their perseverance, they were in wet weather far behind.
For the English seldom or never used the barrow; but only
a light narrow spade, about 18 inches long, and 6 inches
wide; and scooped or hollowed out in the mouth.  With
this they threw out wedges of earth and clay, from the
deepest part of the cut, over their shoulder, with the greatest
ease and expedition, to the distance of 6 or 10 yards.  This
appeared to me a simple, safe, and very expeditious method;
and peculiarly adapted to such a work, in such a soil.
   The whole cut has now the appearance of a small canal.
And if the banks were planted with willows, or even one
hedge row of them, they would soon adorn the whole plain;
and become a valuable article to the proprietors.
   Excepting these two rivers, there are none else in this
parish; though there is a variety of rills, rivulets and burns.
The most remarkable of these is the Garrel burn.  This, as
its name denotes, is a rough, rapid, turbulent stream.  Its
whole course is in this parish, and does not exceed 4 miles.
Yet in a mile and a half, it falls nearly 1000 feet.  So that
there is a great number of cataracts, and water falls in its
course.  But though very romantic, and even awful in
times of a great flood, yet as none of them are above 50 feet
perpendicular, they are not very distinguished.
