     PARISH OF TROQUIRE.

     BY the Rev. Mr John Ewart.

     Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.

   This parish is in the stewarty of Kirkcudbright, and in
the presbytery and synod of Dumfries.  It is bounded
by the river Nith on the east; by the parish of New Abbey
on the south; by Lochrutton on the west; and Terregles on
the north.  It is 7 1/2 miles long, and about 4 1/2 broad.
The soil is various, but generally light.  Moss and moor form,
perhaps, the fourth part of the parish.  The country is partly
flat, and partly hilly.  Part of the hills is covered with heath
or coarse grass.  There are few rocks.

   Rivers.-The river Nith produces salmon and sea trout,
which yield in the spring 6 d. English 1 b.; 3 d. and 2 1/2 d.
per 1 b. in summer and harvest.  In the two last seasons they
are in greatest perfection.  Nith is navigable with large ves-
sels at the foot of the parish: and in the middle with small
lime and coal ones from England.  Sea mud comes up this
river, and is used for manure much success.
