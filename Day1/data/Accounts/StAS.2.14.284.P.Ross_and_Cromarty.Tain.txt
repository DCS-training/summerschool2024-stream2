    284                    ROSS AND CROMARTY,

    for the magnificent wall of rock, to near the base of which it has now
    attained, is manifestly the result of the action of the waves, at a pe-
    riod whose distance we have no data for calculating, beating, in their
    line of greatest advance, against this farthest projecting portion of
    the sandstone hill. The traveller along the high road westward,
    as he issues from a territory that promises little to excite admiration,
    is suddenly astonished to find himself walled in upon his left, by a
    lofty precipice consisting of immense masses of stratified stone,
    piled one upon another in regular ascent, by the giant hand of na-
    ture,-in one part cleft and scooped away into the form of a ra-
    vine, in another jutting directly out upon his path, and perhaps
    exciting a momentary shudder,as, looking up from beneath the spot,
    he beholds an enormous projecting mass seeming ready to tum-
    ble from its elevation of forty or fifty feet upon his head; while
    at the same time, the rich clothing afforded by the ornamental trees
    with which nature and art have invested the once naked rocks, the
    ivy mantling, in many a place, over the surface of the steep, and
    everywhere here and there the birches that, rooted in the very edge
    of some beetling fragment, project their slight forms overhead,-
    confer an air of softness that renders it difficult to tell whether
    the prevailing character be the beautiful or the sublime.
       Over the sandstone formation now described, there lies a stra-
    tum of red clay, varying in depth from a few inches near the
    summit of the hill, to at least 50 or 60 feet, as descending sea-
    ward over -the gentle slope of the middle district, we reach the
    ridge of the escarpment which separates it from the plain below. In
    this stratum it is that we find boulders of most frequent occurrence,
    and that in greater abundance always, as we approach nearer the
    sandstone underneath,-whether by digging down to meet it, by
    ascending. the hill to where it almost reaches the surface, or, last-
    ly, by proceeding along the shore westward to where the sandy
    and terrace districts gradually dwindle away. These boulders,
    which are composed partly of gneiss, but chiefly of a kind
    of granite, of which no rocks are to be found nearer than the
    western coast of Ross-sbire, and which often attain a very large
    size,(one block, especially, known as the Big Stone of Morangie,
    containing, at least 1400 or 1500 cubic feet,) seem to have been
    carried hither after the deposition, but before the hardening of the
    clayey stratum. Immediately over it (save that, in some places,
    a middle layer of gravel is interposed) lies a rich soil, composed
    principally of a mixture of clay and sand, and capable of cultivation.
