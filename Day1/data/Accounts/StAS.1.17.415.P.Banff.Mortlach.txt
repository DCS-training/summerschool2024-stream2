farmer.  Mr Duff of Drumuir is likewise a proprietor in
Mortlach, having a small piece of ground in it, called Loch-
end, near the kirk of Botriphny.
   The arable fields, which, by a rough guess, may be from 4
to 5 thousand acres, lie chiefly pretty high along the Fiddich
and Dullan, two beautiful rivulets; or on the sides of rills
falling into these; or on the more gentle declivities of the
mountains.  The lands of Glenmarky and Edinglassie are re-

called Murky, running with rapidity down the glen, meets
with the Doveron near the house of Edinglassie, where that

sweet and the wild; and furnish a great deal of picturesque
and very rural scenery: If Thomson or an Allan Ram-
say had lived here, they would have been famous in song.
One of the most remarkable is the Craig of Balveny, with the
