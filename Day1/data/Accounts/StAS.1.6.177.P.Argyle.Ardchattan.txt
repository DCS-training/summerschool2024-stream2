   Horses, Cattle, and Sheep.-The number of horses, in-
cluding breeding mares, at the lowest computation, amounts
to 440 or 450.  Though small, they are well shaped, hardy,
and easily fed.  Their price has advanced considerably within
these few years; they now cost from 10 to L. 12.-In the
parish are from 2600 to 2800 black-cattle: though not of a
large size, they are in general handsome and well haired, and in
great estimation with the English drovers.  Numbers are sold
annually at from L. 4 to L. 6 each.  Two five year old stots, of
the Highland breed, fed by Mr Campbell of Barcaldine, were
raised to such a size as to sell for 40 guineas this year (1792).
-There are between 28,000 and 30,000 sheep.  The large
breed, brought some years ago from the south country, pro-
duce a greater quantity of wool, but are much inferior in qua-
lity of the old Highland sheep.  Thousands are sold yearly to
the low country butchers.  When a few are purchased by in-
dividuals, they sell for from 12 s. to 14 s.  White wool sold
last year at 7 s. 6 d. the stone; wool besmeared with tar at
5 s. 6 d.-8 sleeces, on an average, to the stone.-The deep
rooted prejudice against swine's flesh is now removed: most
of the farmers rear some of that species, which, not 30 years
ago, they held in the utmost detestation.

   Rent.-The valued rent is L. 587: 7: 4 Scotch.  The
real rent has increased considerably within these ten years, and
is supposed to be between L. 4,000 and L. 5,000 sterling, ex-
clusive of the cutting of the woods and the kelp shores.  It is
difficult to ascertain the quantity of kelp made here, as the
shores are so extensive that one of the heritors can go upon his
own ground no less than 9 computed miles along the sea-coast:
moreover the kelp is sold to strangers, who find their account
in concealing the produce.  Few farms are let below L. 60,
