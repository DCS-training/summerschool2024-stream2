   Ecclesiastical State and Schools.-The church is an old Gothic
structure; it has been frequently repaired, and is in tolerable
good order.  In times of Episcopacy it was a prebendary be-
longing to the bishop of Dunkeld.-The stipend of Alyth is
6 chalders, 11 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 1 lippie and a half vic-
tual, two thirds meal and one third bear, L. 39: 17: 4 6/12 in
money, and about L. 1: 10 of small tythes.  The glebe consists
of six acres of good land.-The manse was lately repaired.
The heritors have on all occasions been ready to grant everything
necessary to accomodate the minister.  The crown and the
family of Airly claim the patronage.
   Alyth is an excellent station for a schoolmaster, being in the
centre of a populous parish.  The heritors have augmented
the salary to 200 merks Scotch, and built a shcool and school-
master's house on a larger scale than usual.  The salary, and
perquisities of the session clerk's office, will amount to L. 9-
The schoolmaster has likewise the interest of L. 40 sterling,
bequenthed by the late incumbent Mr. Robertson for the educa-
tion of a few children of his name.  The school dues have
been lately increased and regulated; and, by the favour of the
heritors, the schoolmaster enjoys some very considerable advan-
tages.
