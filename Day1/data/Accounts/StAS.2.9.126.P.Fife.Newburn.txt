              V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
  Market-Towns.-The nearest market-towns are Colinsburgh
and Largo, each of which is a very short distance from the east
and West part of this parish.
  Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church, which is commodious
and conveniently situated, was built in 1815. The heritors made
very ample provision for the accommodation of the parishioners;
consequently it is capable of containing more than the whole po-
pulation. The manse was built in 1819. The extent of the ara-
ble glebe is 5 imperial acres, the grass glebe between 21 and 22.
The value of both may be about L. 30 per annum. The amount
of the stipend nearly L. 200. A process of augmentation has
been depending before the Court of Teinds upwards of ten years.
The average number of communicants at the Established Church
is 180. There are now few Seceders of any description; and the
sect of Independents which formerly flourished in this parish is
gone, and the place where they were wont to assemble for public
worship, is converted into a granary. The number of Seceding
or Dissenting families in the parish is 3.
   Education.-The branches of education taught at the parochial
school are, English, Latin, Greek, writing, and arithmetic. In
1659, John Wood, Esq. of Orkie, destined that property for erect-
ing a free grammar-scbool in this parish, and maintaining several
poor scholars. The parochial schoolmaster educates and main-
tains these poor boys,-a liberal allowance being given him for that
purpose by the patrons of Wood's Iiistitution. The salary which
he receives as a parochial schoolmaster is L. 29, 18s. 10d.; and his
fees amount to about L. 14 per annum.
   Poor and Parochial Funds-the average number of poor per-
sons receiving parochial aid is 12, and the average sum allotted to
each per year is L.1, 15s. 5d. The annual amount of contribu-
