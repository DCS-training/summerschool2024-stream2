17 s. 8 d. money.  The corn glebe was formerly about 5
acres of the best land in the parish, to which was added
the pasturage of 2 horses and 2 cows, summer and win-
ter, over an extensive range of rich grass; but, near 30
years ago, the manse being removed to the village of Ga-
vintown, 10 acres of very indifferent outfield land, lying
contiguous, and 4 L. 2 s. of money, were accepted in lieu
of the old glebe and pasturage.  The patronage belongs
to the Countess of Breadalbane.  The church was built in
1736, and is at this time in a ruinous state.  The manse,
built in 1766, was, at that time, among the best, if not
the very best manse in the county.  It is still in tolerable
repair.  The schoolmaster has a small house in Gavintown
to teach in.  His salary is 100 merks, and 10 s. of fee for
acting as precentor and session-clerk.  His scholars may
be reckoned, on an average, 20 in number, whom he in-
structs in reading, writing, and arithmetick.  The esta-
blished fees of the schoolmaster are 1 s. 2 d. a-quarter for
reading and writing, and 2 s. 6 d. a-quarter for arithmetick.
With this small income, being himself a virtuous man,
and having an industrious wife, he has brought up a fa-
mily, and been always respectable.  The poor on the roll
are usually 9; 2 or 3 more receive an occasional supply.
The yearly collection in the church amounts to about 5 l.,
the one half of which is reserved for such persons as de-
cline being put on the roll; the other half is added to the
parochial assessment.  The assessment, on an average of 5
years, is 28 L. 14 s.; the one half paid by the heritors, the
other half by the tenants.  The poor have at all times
been well satisfied with the provision made for them.
