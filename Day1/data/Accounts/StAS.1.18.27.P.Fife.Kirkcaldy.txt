   Linen Manufactures.-The prosperity of this place, which was
at first begun, and for a long time entirely supported by ship-
ping and commerce, has of late been greatly promoted by
manufactures; and particularly by the manufacture of linen.
The kinds of linen manufactured here are bed-ticks, chec-
quered and striped linens, with a mixture of cotton in some
of them, and a low-priced species of plain linen.  These ap-

ders; the names which some of the fabrics still bear, such as,
striped Hollands, Dutch checks, Dutch ticks, Flanders checks
and ticks, pointing their origin to the Low Countries.  The
particular time at which the manufacture of these articles was
introduced, is not exactly known; but they can be traced
back to the commencement of this century.  And proba-
bility seems to support the opinion that they were intro-

century and the Revolution, when the declension of their
navigation and trade, forced the inhabitants to have
recourse to new ways of employing their industry.

Union.  In 1733, the whole amount of cloth stamped at
Kirkaldy*, was no more than 177,740 yards.  In 1743, it
