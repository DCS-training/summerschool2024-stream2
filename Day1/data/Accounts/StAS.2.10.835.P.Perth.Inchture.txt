tion more of late to this most important matter, as regards Ayr-
shire and Teeswater, or short-horned cattle, as well as horses.
   Husbandry.-The system of cultivation pursued is not sur-
passed in Scotland, probably not in the world.  The parish, consist-
ing chiefly of rich alluvial soil, the greater part, about two-thirds, is
farmed according to a rotation of "sevens," i. e. wheat, pease and
beans, wheat, barley, grass, oats, and fallow.  The other third
nearly may be described as farmed after a rotation of "sixes," i. e.
wheat, pease or turnips, barley, grass, oats, and fallow, or pota-
toes.  Of late, a few more acres of potatoes and turnips have been
cultivated in the clay portion than formerly.
   A great portion of the farms is now very thoroughly drained;
and the reclaiming of the land at present overflowed by the tide
is going on apace.
   The ordinary duration of leases is nineteen years.
   Farm-Buildings and Enclosures.-The houses and fartia-build-
ings are, for the most part, good, having had their share of im-
provement with most other things. The enclosures are as yet
almost confined to the upper part of the parish, though hedge-rows
have of late been planted to a very considerable extent on the pro-
perty of Lord Kinnaird in the lower part.  Where they do exist,
they are in general good, being either hedge-rows or strong paling.
   Quarries.-There are several quarries in the parish of trap or
whinstone and red sandstone.  A limestone quarry was opened
on the Ballindean property at one time, but it has not been made
available for several years.
   Mines.- Several veins of copper ore are to be found in the pa-
rish.  They have, however, never been wrought.
   Average gross amount Of raw Produce.*-The produce of the
parish may be nearly as follows:

<FOOTNOTE>The Principle of the above estimate is, that the parish contains about 3700 Scotch
acres, two-thirds of wbich are usually in cultivation,-1666 farmed according to a
rotation of "sevens," and 833 according to a rotation of "sixes;" of the remain-
ing third, about two-thirds are usually in grass, and the remainder in wood.  The
average of places for the last nine years is adopted.
