all the kinds of fish that are to be found in the mouth of
the Frith of Forth, which are fold at very reasonable rates.
Lobsters and crabs are in plenty, but there are no oysters or
muscles.  The lobsters are almost all carried to London by
smacks that come along the coast for that purpose, at stated
intervals.

   Minerals, Game, etc-In the rocks on the coast, great
quantities of lime-stone are to be found, though not of a

usual kinds of game, which are to be found in the lower
parts of Berwick-shire, are here in great plenty.  On the
higher grounds in this parish, dotterels are supposed to ap-
pear sooner than on any parts in the south of Scotland.

poor, weak, and exhausted, probably from their long flight
across the German Ocean.

farms, and the abridgement of labour, in consequence of the
improved state of agriculture, uniformly operate to the
diminishing the number of the inhabitants, certainly the de-
crease of the population of this parish ought of late years to

considerable extent in a neighbouring parish.  From any en-
quiries, however, which the incumbent has made, he does
not find that the decrease has been so great as might have
been expected.  And he should imagine, that, if a full investi-
gation were made of the matter, there would be less cause
than is generally supposed, for regretting that union of farms,
