wood, if none grew in the islands, since their intercourse
then with woody countries must have been very limited, as
these Counts disputed the possession of these islands about
the 10th century?  If we go as far back as the days of
Ossian, we find he says there were woods in these islands;
for in his poem of Carric-thura, in which he relates Fingal's
expedition to assist Cathulla King of Inistore, or Orkneys, he
says, a rock bends along the coast, with all its echoing wood.
This is perhaps only a poetical licence; but, as he is the
Homer of Scotland, if we pay the same regard to the truth
of his geographical descriptions, as the Greeks did to those
of Homer, his testimony is of some weight.  Be this as it
may, it is certain there are no trees in any of the Orkney
islands at present.

   Soil.-The soil is almost every where mixed with sand, and,
in many places, is entirely sand; and, where this last is the case,
it is not cultivated, unless there be plenty of sea-ware to ma-
nure it with.  80 Horse loads of sea-ware have been sometimes
carried half a mile, to be laid on a piece of sandy ground,
which produced but one boll of bear in return.  The black
earth mixed with sand, and clay mixed with sand, are the
best soils.  As a great quantity of corn must be paid in kind
to the superior, or Lord Paramount of these islands, the
farmers cannot afford to meliorate the soil, by fallowing or
by green crops; and therefore it may be thought, that the
soil is, in some degree, exhausted; for it is agreed, that this
sea-ware does not better the soil beyond the present crop;
and, by the accounts of former crops, it appears they were
better; at the same time, it is indisputable that farming is
now better understood.  The soil cannot be called bad, since
it has produced bear and oats, in constant succession, past the
memory of man, which an English or Lothian farmer would
