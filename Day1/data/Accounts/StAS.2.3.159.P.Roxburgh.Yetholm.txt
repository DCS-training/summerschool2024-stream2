			PARISH OF YETHOLM.

	PRESBYTERY OF KELSO, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE.

		THE REV.  JOHN BAIRD, MINISTER.


	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

    Name.-YETHOLM is sometimes written Zetholm, Zettin, Yet-
tam, and Yetham; which last is probably the original name of
the parish.  It seems to be derived from the Scoto-Saxon word
"Yet," or "Gate," signifying a gate or road, and obviously con-
nected with the Anglo-Saxon word Zeat, Zete, Zate, porta.  Yet-
holm is a border parish, and the villages of Town and Kirk Yet-
holm are separated from England by a valley one mile in length, and
about a quarter of a mile in breadth, which, in former times, must
have presented a very easy access or entrance from the one country
to the other; so that Yetholm or Yetham may signify the hamlet or
dwelling upon the great entrance from England, or the adjoining
part of Northumberland, into Scotland.
    Extent-Boundaries.-The extent of the parish is 2 miles from
nearly north-east to south-west, and 4 miles from north-west to
south-east. It marches with England for a distance of about six
miles, and no part of the parish is distant more than two miles from
the border.
    Topographical Appearances.-The general aspect and outline of
the parish is hilly, though none of the hills are of any great ele-
vation; the highest probably not exceeding 700 or 800 feet above
the level of the sea.  The lower hills are cultivated; and the
higher, which are a portion of the Cheviot range, are clothed-with
a rich green sward to their summits, affording excellent pasture
to many thousands of sheep.  Several peaceful and romantic little
valleys lie embosomed amid these hills; and the vale of the Bow-
mont itself, in which nine-tenths of the inhabitants of the parish
reside, is only a larger vale of the same description.  That part
of this vale which lies in the parish of Yetholm is two miles long,
and from a quarter to nearly half a mile in breadth, and appearrs
