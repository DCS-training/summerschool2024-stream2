     Stastistical Account

stands on a rocky ground, an abounds in most excellent
water, from the purest springs.  It contains 56 families, 
or separate dwellings.  Two of there families, consist of 10
persons each; two of 9; four of 7; four of 6; six of 5; 
four of 4; nine of 3; sixteen of 2; and nine houses or 
rooms are inhabited by individuals; in all 204 inhabitants. 
It is to be regretted, that in so fine situation, the houses 
are not built in such order as to form a regular street.  The 
population of the parish has increased within these 30
years, owing chiefly to the many married ploughmen, and 
labourers, who live on the lands of Rosemount.  One fourth 
part of the inhabitants, in the country part of the 
parish, reside there, although there lands consist only of 
about a sixth of the surface, and are mostly in the proprei-
tor's own possession.
