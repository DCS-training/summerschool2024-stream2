   Prices of Grain and Provisions.-The price of grain is, in
a great measure, regulated by the highest fiars of East Lo-
thian.  Beef sells from 3 d. to 4 1/2 d. per lib.; mutton and
veal, from 3 d. to 5 d.; pork, from 3 d. to 4 d.; good lamb,
from 1 s. to 3 s. per quarter; fowls, 1 s. sometimes more;
pigeons, from 2 s. to 3 s. per dozen; eggs, from 4 d. to 8 d.
per dozen; butter, at the beginning of the seasons 1 s.; it
is seldom under 9 d. per lib. 20 ounce Dutch.

   Manufactures.-There are at present 10 Salt Pans in
the parish, but only 6 are wrought.  When the weather
is dry, and the coal good, a pan may be drawn 5 times in a
week.  Each draught requires 3 fillings of water, and yields,
in summer, about 18 bushels++, in winter about 16.  The
difference is owing to the sea water being stronger in summer
than in winter: For the same reason, in winter it requires
26 or 28 hours to a draught; in summer only 20 or 22.  The
process is sometimes retarded by the badness of the coal.
When the sea water is good, a Scotch gallon of it will yield
of salt nearly one lib. Avoirdupois.  The draught consumes
