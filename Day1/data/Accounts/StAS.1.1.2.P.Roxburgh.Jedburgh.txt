     Statistical Account

   Extent.-The extent of this parish is considerable, being
about thirteen miles long, and in some places not less than six
or seven miles broad:  But the figure is irregular, being fre-
quently intersected by the parishes of Oxnam and Southdean.
It is bounded by Northumberland on the south and south-
east, by the parish of Oxnam on the east, by Southdean on
the south and south-west, by Bedrule on the west, by Ancrum
on the north and north-west, and by Crailing on the north-
east.

   Situation and Surface.-The parish is situated within the
county of Roxburgh or Tiviotdale.  It is the seat of a
presbytery, (that of Jedburgh) and belongs to the synod of
Merse and Tiviotdale.  The soil is various.  The lower part
of the parish, lying upon the banks of the Tiviot, is flat, and
in general consists of light loam; but some part of it is gra-
velish, and some deep clay.  By far the greater part of the
parish, however, consists of hills and sheep farms.  The hills
are generally green and dry; but the interjacent flats are co-
vered with bent, and rather swampy.  On the whole, not
above a fifth or sixth part of the parish consists of arable
ground.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The climate also varies in different
parts of the parish.  It is often mild and temperate in the
town of Jedburgh, environed with the high banks of the ad-
jacent river, while it is sharp and cold at the distance if
a mile or two.  The town itself is peculiarly healthy, fewer
epidemical distempers prevailing there than in the neigh-
bouring towns of Hawick and Kelso.  The rheumatism is
the most common disorder, which, though not frequent a-
mong people of better station, who are comfortably cloth-
ed, fed, and lodged, is nevertheless very general among the
poorer sort of people, particularly such as are advanced in
