at once lying at anchor in Scrabster Roads.  They come
upon the coast in September, and continue until Marc; and
no sooner carry one cargo of live fish to market, than they
return for another.  For the most part, they fish in Pent-
land Frith, through the day time, and in the evenings re-
turn to Scrabster Roads, to lie during the night.  But some-
times they run as far to the westward as Cape Wrath, and
when they do not find it convenient to return to Scrabster
Roads, they take shelter in Loch Eribol, or Erripool.
   Out native fishermen, do not bear the London smacks the
best good will; they complain that they carry off the fish
which they should catch; and it is certain, that when our
Thurso fishers catch few cod, the London smacks pick them
up in abundance; but the reasons is obvious, the smacks fish
with muscles or whelks for bait, which are far superior to
the limpet, always used by the Thurfo fishers.
   That the smack cod-fishing, might be carried on to advan-
tage by ourselves, can admit of no doubt, unless we were
to suppose it possible, that the London fishmongers, would
consider it as interfering with their trade, and combine to
disappoint us of a market for our fish.  One thing is cer-
tain, that we could fish at less expence than they do, by em-
ploying the country fishermen, who would be content with
lower wages, and cheaper provisions, than is given on board
the English smacks.  These now employ occasionally some
of the Thurfo fishers, as extra hands, and pay them 12 s. per
week of wages, and allow them all the small fish they
catch to themselves.  The English fishers receive 18 s. per
week.
