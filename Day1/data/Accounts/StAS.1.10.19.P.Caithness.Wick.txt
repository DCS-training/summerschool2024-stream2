about 12 shopkeepers, 9 or 10 shipmasters, 50 coopers, in-
cluding apprentices, a few house, ship, and boat carpenters,
together with masons, smiths, weavers, shoemakers, taylors,
etc. sufficient for the size of the place.  The greater part of
these tradesmen are occasionally employed as fishermen.

   Religious persuasions.-Of late, some seceders (antiburghers)
have made their appearance, but they are much on the de-
cline, and have at present no settled minister.  There is but
one stated preacher of that persuasion at present in the coun-
ty, who is settled at Thurso.  The parishioners, in general,
are of the established church of Scotland, of good, moderate,
and peaceable dispositions, not ignorant of the principles, nor
inattentive to the practice, of religion.-There are still about
half a dozen Anabaptists on the estate of Keiss, the remains
of the disciples of the late Sir William Sinclair, who was
himself a zealous Anabaptist, and made some proselytes a-
mongst his tenants.  But this small exception to the gene-
ral persuasion of the people is scarcely worth notice.

   Stipend.-The present living of the minister of Wick is
97 L. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling, the vicarage tiend being converted
at 200 L. Scotch, and the victual at 8 L. Scotch per boll,
for which the Lords of Session pronounced decrees in 1775.
There is a good manse and offices built in 1786, a garden
with a glebe and some inclosures and improvements.  The
glebe was exchanged for a sufficient equivalent on Mr Dun-
bar's estate, and an adequate consideration was given for the
garden ground, corn yard, and stance or site of the old manse
and offices.  The present church is very old, a long, dark,
and ill constructed building, perhaps the worst in Caithness;
a new fabric will soon be necessary.  The patronage of this

or in kind, but they are likewise bound to pay personal services
for a certain number of days in the week.
