ing caught fire, either by accident or design, nobody knows which.
There is a very extensive view from it both of sea and land-
Grange is bounded on the east, west, and south, by the parishes
of Marnock, Rothiemay, Cairney, and Keith; on the north, by
that of Deskford and part of Fordyce. On the northern part
there are two hills, the Lurghill and the bill of Altmore, now call-
ed Aulmore, which signifies the great burn. In the centre there
is the 8illyearn, on which there is an extensive plantation, young
and thriving. In the southern part there are the Mickle and
little Balloch, the lower parts of which are now covered with wood.
Towards the top there could be no hope of a tree, as it is dry,
rough, and rocky. On the Mickle Balloch, there are several
graves of some unhappy suicides, marked by a cairn, not sacred to
their memory, but to tell of their unchristian burial and untimely
end. Here is the Gallow-hill, too, of which tradition speaks with
fear and trembling. On this memorable mount the criminals of
the district met their ignominious fate. The abbots, as well as
the feudal barons of those days, had the power to condemn with-
out appeal, and, it is likely, to execute without justice.
    The Isla is a fine trouting stream. It takes its rise in Loch-
park, on the estate of Admiral Duff, in the parish of Botriphnie,
runs through Keith and Grange, and empties itself into the Do-
veron, in the parish of Rothiemay.
    There are few remarkable springs, unless two or three, that,
even in the driest season, are ever flowing, and full. The best
known is the Ladywell, consecrated by some temperate abbot who
indulged in the soft purity of the fountain. There is also the
Croik, or the well of the cross, cold and pure, on the opposite
side of the Isla; and a few others of less note.
