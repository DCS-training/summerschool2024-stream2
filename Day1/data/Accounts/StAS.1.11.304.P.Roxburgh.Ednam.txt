     Statistical Account

   Extent and Climate.-In extent, it is about 3 miles broad,
and rather somewhat more in length.  The climate of Edenham,
from its situation on the two rivers, is undoubtedly salubri-
ous; yet, since the present incumbent was settled, it has been
visited by different epidemical fevers, that sometimes proved

   Cultivation, Surface, Hills, Soil, etc.-Agriculture is carried
on to a great extent in this parish.  The industry and activity
of the farmers cannot be exceeded, and they are all opulent and

and Eden.  The parish contains also several fields, lying on in-

of the Eden, near the village, called Edenham Hill, and another
between the Tweed and the Eden, called Henderside Hill.
The height of neither is great, though not ascertained; but
they are both highly cultivated.  The soil is of various kinds:
some part of it strong clay, some of it light sand and channel,
and some of it a mixture of both.  In a few places there is a
thin bed of moss, covering rich stores of marl.  The marl has
been dug for manure, at considerable expence, and it has been
attended with great success.  Burned lime-stone is brought
in great quantities from Northumberland, at the distance of
17 or 18 miles.

   Produce and Farm Rents.-The ground produces wheat,
barley, pease and beans, and oats, all of the best quality,
which can scarcely be exceeded in any part of Scotland.  It
produces also turnips, and broad clover, in abundance; and the
pasture land is of the richest kind.  Land rent is consequent-
