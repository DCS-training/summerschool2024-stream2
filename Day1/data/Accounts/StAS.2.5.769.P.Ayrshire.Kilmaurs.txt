				PARISH OF KILMAURS.

		PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.

		THE REV. WILLIAM SINCLAIR, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Extent.--IN some ancient records of session, the
name is spelled Kilmares, which appears to be connected with
the word Marie, and if so, it is probable that the Kil was dedi-
cated to the Mother of our Lord. Others suppose the name to
be derived from the circumstance of the church having been de-
dicated to St Maxirs. The length of this parish from east to west
is six, and the greatest breadth from north to south three, miles.
It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Stewarton,--east, by
Fenwick,--south, by Kilmarnock,--and west, by Irvine.
	A rivulet, which rises in Fenwick, and runs the whole length of
the parish from east to west, divides it nearly into two equal parts.
This rivulet is known here by the name of Kilmaurs water. A
little lower it is called Carinel, which name it retains, till it loses
itself in the Irvine.
	The surface consists of large fields, with many gentle risings
and declivities interspersed. The summits of these are covered
with trees, planted in circles, which, with others of the same kind,
spread all over Cunninghame, give a beautiful appearance to the
whole of this country, as well as profit to the owners. The pros-
pect from these summits, which are in every farm, is extensive and
delightful; for many miles all round, the whole country appears
as one well cultivated garden.

			II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
	Parochial Register.--The register of births and marriages com-
menced in 1688, but was not regularly kept till 1783.
	Town of Kilmaurs.--It was erected into a bough of barony by
James V. at the instance of Cuthbert Earl of Glenecairn, and Wil-
liam, his son, Lord Kilmaurs. That noble family then resided in
this parish, where they had a house. By a charter, written in
Latin, and signed by the said Cuthbert Earl of Glencairn, and
	AYR.                                      3 c
