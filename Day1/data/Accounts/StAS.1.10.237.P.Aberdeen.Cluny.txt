     Of Cluny.

nerally ploughed by oxen, ten and sometimes twelve in a
plough, yoked together in the old manner, by yokes and
wooden bows; except by heritors, who plough with two
horses and four oxen, and sometimes only two yoked with
collars and ropes, which enable them to draw with greater
ease, as much as 10 or 12 oxen, yoked in the old manner.
Improvements here are but in their infancy; but as the heri-
tors show a good example, and the farmers are inclinable to
learn, it is to be hoped they will be carried on to a consider-
able degree of perfection.  The old Scotch plough, which for
lee and stony ground is perhaps the best, is yet generally used;
but the long stilted plough with an iron head, and curved
mould board, begins to be introduced.  The ridges which
were formerly crooked and gathered up to a high top, leav-
ing the sides thin and poor, are now made straight and level-
led; and inclosures, which formerly were never attempted,
are now begun even by the tenants, who gather the stones
out of their fields, and with them make substantial fences;
the expence being advanced either by the heritors or farmers
paying a certain interest, or by the farmers themselves, on an
obligation from the heritors for a reimbursement at the ex-
piry of their lease.  There are in the parish 80 L. black cattle,
1300 sheep, 132 horses, 2 waggons, 80 carts.  About thirty
years ago, there were but two carts in the whole parish, and
these belonged to the two principal heritors; meal and grain
are carried on horses backs, peat, and turf, the crop and every
thing else were carried in the same way, because the roads
were in a state of nature.  But between the years 1750 and
1760, the gentleman of the county began to exact the statute
labour; for this purpose, they divided the county into dis-
tricts, according to the number of presbyteries, and they ap-
pointed the commissioners of supply in each of there districts,
to keep regular meetings, to call forth all the country people
