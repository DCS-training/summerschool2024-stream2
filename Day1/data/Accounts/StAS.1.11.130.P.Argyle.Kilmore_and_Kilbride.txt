part of the country, will soon come in for their share.-The
manse was built in 1760; but it is very slight and insufficient.
It underwent some repairs not long ago; but it can never be
made a good house.  The stipend, on the admission of the
present incumbent, was stated to him at 60 bolls and 2
pecks of oatmeal, (9 stones per boll), and 39 L. 7 s. 9 1/3 d. Ster-
