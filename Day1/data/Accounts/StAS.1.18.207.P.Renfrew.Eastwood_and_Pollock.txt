and respectful to the office and character of the ministers of
religion.  The church was a few years ago also re-built.  At
that time it was removed from the neighbourhood of the
manse, to a situation nearer to Pollok-shaws.  It is now

these 17 boarders are included.  There is an annual exami-

English 2 s per quarter, for perfecting in book-keeping, L. 1: 1.
The terms for boarding washing and education, are L. 20
per annum.
