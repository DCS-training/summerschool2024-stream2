along the lawn, is quite careless of modern refinement, trust-
ing his success and prosperity to the kind hand of provi-
dence, and the faithful bosom of the earth.  He is now,
however, beginning to perceive, that man was not formed
a simple passive being, but inquisitive, active, persevering,
and industrious.  The genial warmth of religion, and the
piercing rays of philosophy, begin to expand his ideas; he
now perceives, with wonder and astonishment, the exten-
sive powers of the human mind; and, like a man awake
from a dream, he starts at the recollection of those wild
ideas of uncertainty that formerly employed his imagina-
tion.  Hence a spirit of activity is fast spreading among the
inhabitants of this district; and when once they are com-
pletely awake from their past slumbers, it may be reason-
ably hoped they will soon excel in arts and sciences.  There
are many laudable examples, of late, held forth by men of
spirit and enterprise among them; the genius of commerce
and agriculture appears to have visited their borders; and,
should they once be sensible of their local advantages, no
parish in Scotland will, perhaps, excel this, either in popu-
lation or wealth.

   Towns.-The only town in the parish is Doune.  The
name originates from the town being situated near by the
ancient castle known by that name, which will be explain-
ed under the title Doune Castle.
   It is very probable this town is coeval with the castle;
but while public worship was dispensed at Kilmadock this
town was very tristling; and when the church at Doune ws
built, in the year 1756, there were very few houses, except
some scattered huts.  Since that period, however, the va-
cancies have been supplied with neat buildings covered with
slate.
