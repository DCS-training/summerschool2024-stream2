cing them.  From the annexation, the inhabitants of the
parish of Bervie have rather diminished than increased,
so the the whole addition made to the number of people
for almost 40 years in both parishes, has been entirely on
the side of Liff*.  It is further to be remarked, that at that
period the population of both Liff and Bervie, was probably
much less than it had been for many years before, at least
during the interval between the improvements above men-
tioned, and the establishment and growth of manufactures,
and hence that the amount of examinable persons at the an-
nexation of the parishes, is not, strictly speaking, to be con-
sidered as conveying a proper idea of the ancient state of
population in this district.  The present number of the in
habitants amounts to 1790.  Of this number, there are 339
reckoned under the age of ten, which falls somewhat
short of the usual proportion, owing to the late irregular
accession of letter, the frequent change of servants, and
the various success of manufactures.  The native inhabi-
tants are few in comparison with the strangers who have set-
tled lately.  There are many of the former who are able
to trace their ancestors back for several generation; and,
in particular, there is one family, who withour any change
of circumstances, unless what has necessarily been procu-
ced by the gradual and slow operations of time, now inhe-
rit the same spot cultivated by their forefathers, prior to
the aera of the Repormation.

*Those who are, curious about investigations of this fort, may from
the above account, and the different enumerations given of the inhabitants
of Liff, inform themselves pretty accurately of the state of its population
from 1650 to 1753, and from thence down to 1792, including a period of
no less than 142 years.
