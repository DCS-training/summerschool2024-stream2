     NUMBER XI.

     PARISH OF MARYCULTURE.

     (PRESBYTERY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, COUNTY
     OF KINCARDINE.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN GLENNIE.

     Name, Extent, Soil, Rivers, etc.
   THE original orthography of this parish seems to have
been Maria cultura.-It is of an oblong form; 6
English miles in length, and 2 in breadth; extending from
the river Dee to the Grampian mountains.  The soil on the
river side is naturally thin and sandy; on the rising midland it
becomes deeper and blacker, with a bottom of clay in some
parts; and more southward, the ground turns swampy, turfy,
and mossy.  The extremities of the parish are in some places
rocky hills and mosses; in others, green hills with large stones,
rushy muirs, and heath.  Indeed the whole district is rocky
and stony, except some small haughs and dales on the river
side; and thoroughly to improve, inclose, and render tolera-
bly fertile, a piece of waste ground here, may be almost term-
ed a new creation.  The old farms extended actors the whole
breadth of the parish, from the Dee to the Grampians, by which
means every tenant had a portion of all the different soils.
