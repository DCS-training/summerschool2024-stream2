in an opposite direction, passes by the other end of it, and
empties itself into the sea at Irvine.  The fall, from the north
end of Kilbirnie Loch to Clyde, is calculated to be about 95
feet, and the declivity towards the sea can not be much
more.  Were this plan put in execution, besides serving
many other commercial purposes, it would lay open immense
treasures of coal, lime and iron stone.  But should this be
thought too expensive an undertaking, a canal of only half the
proposed length, joining Kilbiruie loch, either to the Clyde or
to the sea, would still be an object of great importance.  Con-
sidering the present high price and scarcity of COALS, any propo-
sal tending to enable proprietors of coals, at a distance from po-
pulous cities, to carry them with advantage to market at home
or abroad, deserves their regard.  And any improvements sug-
gested with a view to secure plenty, or to lessen the price of a
commodity so useful and necessary, has a claim to the pub-
lic attention.
   Whatever reason there might be, to import a servitude upon
the farmers in former times, for encouraging the erection of
corn mills, thirlage is at present justly considered, not only in
many instances to be inconvenient, but in general burthen-
some.  The multure and other perquisites paid to the miller,
and his servants, amount in some places to the 1/11 or 1/11, or even
1/10 of the produce.  This is a heavy tax upon agriculture, and
it lays the tenant under temptation to carry part of his grain
elsewhere, to the prejudice of the miller, as often as he can
avoid detection.  It would be of advantage, therefore, both
to the holders of land, and the proprietors of mills, in this
and other parishes, were the latter obliged to sell, and the for-
mer to buy up this servitude at a moderate value.
