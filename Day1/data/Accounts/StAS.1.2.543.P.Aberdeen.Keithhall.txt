She was twice married; first, to a namesake of her own,
who came from the south country, and is said to have com-
posed the Song, to her praise, that is so generally admired, and
partakes much of the music, which, at that time, abounded
between the Tay and the Tweed.  Her second husband was

in the burgh of Inverurie; and was obliged to fly to Caithness,
or Orkney, where his uncle was bishop.  His flight, and the 
expence of procuring a pardon, ruined his estate.  This is the

London, that that of Aberdeenshire, if it be used without
any affectation.  The unmusical sharpness of the sounds renders
it distinctly audible.  No Gaelic is spoken within 30 English
miles of this district, excepting by natives of the Highlands;
though many of the names of places, as, Caskiebean, (the Sha-
