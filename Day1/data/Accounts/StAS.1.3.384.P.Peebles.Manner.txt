tions, when the rainy season sets in, on the approach of win-
ter.  The winds most prevalent here, are the south and
south-west, which are chiefly owing to the narrow strath;
there being a continued chain of hills, on both sides the wa-
ter, for 6 miles.  The air, though in some of the higher
grounds intense, is both pure and wholesome, and fewer epi-
demical diseases prevail here, than in most parts of Scotland.
The arable land bears but a very small proportion to the pas-
ture ground, and lies mostly at the bottom of the hills, along
the river Manor, and partly on the banks of the Tweed.  It is
naturally fertile, and of a sharp soil; and the harvest is fully
earlier than in the neighbouring parishes.  There is indeed
part of the arable ground of a wet, tilly substance; but it
has lately undergone a material change, by means of drains
and ditches carried on by the proprietors.

   Produce, etc.-Pease, oats, bear, and potatoes, are the
common produce of the arable farms.  A few years ago tur-
nips were introduced into this parish, for fattening cattle,
and have succeeded as well as could be wished.  There is,
however, one great hindrance towards carrying on this spe-
cies of improvement, which is, the want of enclosures;
otherwise the raising of this most useful vegetable, would be
still more general among the farmers.  It is not easy to ascer-
tain the real value of the arable ground, as it is commonly
laid out in sheep pasture:  At an average it may be worth
10 s. the acre.  The mode of cultivation, observed here, in
the rotation of crops, is the same as in other places of
Tweeddale.  It may likewise be observed, that the wages of
servants vary almost nothing throughout the whole county;
the men getting about 6 l. and thw women 3 l. per annum.
Provisions are the same as at Peebles.
