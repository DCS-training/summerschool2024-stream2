	naway through the forest, and extending for several miles along
        the verge of the left bank of the Findhorn.
          Heronry-The banks of the Findborn below Sluie are ren-
        dered remarkable by an extensive heronry which has existed there
        for generations. Some large and ancient oaks -,rowing on the west-
        ern side of the river are covered with the nests of this beautiful
        bird, and a few are lodged in'the high and perpendicular cliffs of
        sandstone that tower over its stream on the eastern side. It is
        extremely interesting to watch the movements of these creatures
        when they are congregated here for the purpose of breeding; and
        the conflict which is waged with them by the jackdaws who are
        continually endeavouring furtively to possess themselves of their
        eggs the moment they quit their nests, is often extremely amusing.

          Land-owners.-Tbe principal land-owner is the Earl of Moray.
        The other beritors, taken in the order corresponding with the va-
	lue of their estates, are, Charles Lennox Cumming Bruce, Esq.

	  Parochial Registers.-These consist of six volumes: 1. contains
	acts of church discipline, from 3d January 1649 to 3d January
	1676, and registers of baptisms and marriages from 1702 to 1 733;
	2. Chiireb discipline and collections for the poor from 1702 to
	1720; 3. Church discipline and collections for the poor from
	1720 to 1764; 4. Register of baptisms from 1733 to 1810, and
	matrimonial contracts from 1741 tn 1826, there being an interval
	in the latter from 1765 to 1783; 5. Church discipline and col-
	lections, and distributions to the poor from 1764 to 1841; 6,
	Register of births and baptisms from 1810, and matrimonial con-
	tracts from 1827 to 1841. From the above, several intervals ap-
	pear to have occurred, in which no insertions were made in the
	registers of church discipline and matrimonial contracts since these
	began to be kept in this parish; and the registers of births and
	baptisms, with: onlyone or two brief periods of exception, seem to
	have, been very irregularly kept, till about thirty years ago.
