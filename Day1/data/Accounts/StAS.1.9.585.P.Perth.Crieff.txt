by the voluntary contributions of the country.  That of
Crieff was the second stone bridge ever thrown over the
Earn, consists of 4 large arches, and was built out of the
vacant stipend of the parish, in the interval between the
suppression of Episcopacy in 1690, and the re-admission of
a Presbyterian minister in I699.

   Soil and Productions.-Near one half of the parish, that
is, along the W. and S. sides, is of a light, randy, sometimes
gravelly soil; around the town, from the nature and quan-
tity of the manure, it becomes a pretty rich loam.  The
other half, to the eastward, is tilly, or a kind of still red
clay, frequently wet, and lying upon rock of the same co-
lour, which yields a hard durable stone for building, out
incapable of hewing; whereas under the sandy soil, to the
westward, is an excellent freestone of a light brown colour,
that easily cuts in the quarry, and admits of a good polish.
Each sort apparently partakes of the nature of the soil un-
der which it is found.-The species of grain raised, are the
best white oats of the late kind, bear, commonly called
Chester, with sometimes a mixture of barley, plenty of
potatoes, a few pease, but no wheat.  Some late experi-
ments have not encouraged the general use of that grain.
One boll of bear gives 1 1/2 bolls of meal, and 1 1/4 boils of oats
1 boll of meal, besides paying kiln and mill dues.  There
are 2 very small orchards of an old date, and 2 others of
some acres extent, planted within these few years; one of
them, near the town, in a good soil and warm S. exposure,
must soon be very productive.

   Agriculture.-Until the year 1774, the old mode of
farming by croft and outfield universally prevailed.  As the
outfields got no manure except watering, wherever that
was wanting, they produced only a species of grey oats,
