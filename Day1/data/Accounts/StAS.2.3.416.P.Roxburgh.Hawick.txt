  The highest rate allowed to paupers on the permanent roll is
L.11, 14s. per annum, and the lowest L.2, 12s.
  Such is the state of pauperism in this parish at the present
time.  It seems, however, to have been very different in former
days.  We find, for example, in 1727, anterior to the imposition
of the legal, assessment, before any voluntary contribution was
made regularly on the part of the heritors, and when the poor
were supported entirely by church collections and other funds in
the hands of the kirk-session, that the total expenditure, as appears
from existing records, amounted only to L. 22, 13s. 10d.; whereas,
in 1837, as is evident from the Foregoing tables, there was actually
expended no less a sum than L. 1009, 9s. 9d.  Considering that
the, population of the parish has been Considerably more than
doubled: during the last  hundred years, it would not have been
surprising if the expenditure for the poor had been increased in
nearly the same proportion.  But the rise from L. 22, 13s. 10d.
to upwards of L.1000 is by far too  great to be satisfactorily ac-
counted for by such a cause.  And we cannot help thingking, that
the increase is to be referred mainly to the influence of a compul-
sory assessment, which, by destroying a spirit of honourable inde-
pendence, has tended to augment by a rapid process the very evils
against which it professes to provide; while the necessity for the
continue operation of such a cause, we feel inclined to ascribe in
