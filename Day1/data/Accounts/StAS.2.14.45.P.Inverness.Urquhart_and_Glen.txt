Grant of Freuchie, now styled Grant of Grant, who obtained pos-
session of most of the lands around it, constituting the domains
of the castle, as the crown's hamberlains; and finally, in the year
1509, when King James IV. was empowered by Parliament to set
out in feu-farm the Royal lands, both annexed and unannexed, he
granted three charters of the lordship of Urquhart and baronid's
