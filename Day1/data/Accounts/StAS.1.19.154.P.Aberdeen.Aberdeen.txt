bar, as well as the depth of the water, ascertained.  These
obstacles have in a great measure been removed by the e-
rection of a new pier, executed according to a plan fur-
nished by John Smeaton, Esq; engineer.  It extends in
length 1200 feet along the north side of the river, and a
considerable way into the sea.  It was begun to be built in
June 1775, and was finished in October 1780.  Since which
time, however, it has received some additions, by the ad-
vice and direction of Mr Smeaton; particularly a jetty
for sheltering the shipping within the harbour, from the
violent in run of the sea, in strong easterly winds.  The cost
of the whole amounted to about L. 18,000 Sterling.  This
expence has been defrayed, partly by some small funds
formerly belonging to the harbour, but chiefly will be paid
by doubling the shore and habour dues upon the trade and
shipping of the place, in consequence of an act of Parlia-
ment obtained for that purpose; but without any public
aid or contribution whatever.
   By the erection of this pier, although it is 200 feet shorter
than in Mr Smeaton's original plan, the navigation channel
at the entry of the harbour has been deepened and impro-
ved to a degree much beyond any thing that was previous-
ly expected.  Now, small vessels, drawing 7 or 8 feet, can
come into the harbour at low water; and at high water, or
spring tides, there is from 18 to 21 feet at the entry, as the
above mentioned bar, or bank of sand, is now, by the con-
finement of the river, and the increased velocity of the cur-
rent, carried out into the sea, at least a quarter of a mile
farther than it formerly was; so that we now see vessels of
considerable burden, in the violence of a florin blowing
right upon the land, failing with safety into the harbour,
even without the assistance of any pilot, which no ship
could have attempted before, without the greatest danger
of being wrecked on the bar, or some part of the adjacent
