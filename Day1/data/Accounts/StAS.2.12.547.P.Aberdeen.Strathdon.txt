by the contractor on the property, and in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of the house.  The accommodations are worthy of Mr
Smith's well-known skill in combining comfort and elegance.  The
furniture and interior finishings by the present proprietor are much
admired.
   The mansion of Inverernan received extensive additions and al-
terations some years ago.  The style is that of a modern villa, par-
taking of the Italian.  The accommodations are ample.  The house
of Auchernach was built in 1809, and for many years was the best
in the country.  Glenkindy, Edinglassie, Bellabeg, and Skellater
are of an older date.
   In 1834, a new  church, manse, and offices were built at the ex-
pense of Sir Charles Forbes, Bart. for the mission of Corgarff.
The plans were given by Mr Daniel.  The church is a very neat
structure.  The manse consists of six rooms, kitchen, and other
conveniences, and the offices are equal if not superior to those of
most parish ministers.  Sir Charles likewise built, in 1832, an ex-
cellent school and dwelling-house for the teacher at Corgarff.  A
new parochial school, on the most approved modern plan, calcu-
lated for 120 scholars, (but which would conveniently contain a
third more,) with a suitable dwelling-house for the schoolmaster,
was built in the summer of 1838 by the heritors.

                      III.-POPULATION.
   We have no account of the population of the parish  previous to
1755, but, judging from the registers of births and marriages at
the close of the seventeenth century, which at that period appear
to have been very exactly kept, it had been much more populous
than in recent times, the entries in any year then being greatly
more numerous than now.
   The following is a statement of the population at different dates
subsequent to 1755 :-
