sheep.  The farms are from L. 60 to L. 450 yearly rent.
Of late years many small farms have been thrown into a
few large ones, and several new farm-houses, with com-
plete office-houses, have been built; on the other hand, as
by this distribution fewer hands are employed than for-
merly, many houses of an inferior sort have gone to ruins.
A threshing-mill has been erected about three years ago by
a tenant at his own expense, and answers well.

   Coal.-About the close of the last century, coal was work-
ed in this parish by a regular set of colliers, and salt-works
were carried on; since that time the works have been

many attempts at coal, but without success.  No fire-en-

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the po-
pulation in 1755 was 919.  The stoppage of the collieries,
and the loss of the various advantages connected with them,
seems to account for a striking diminution of population
which took place early in this century, as appears by the
registers both of this parish, and that of Oldhamstocks.

second diminution, by the alterations which have been
made in the distributions of land into large farms instead of
small ones, one containing now what was formerly three
or four.-The post-office, which was formerly at Auld-
cambus in this parish, is now removed to the Press, in the
parish of Coldingham; about 40 years ago, there were five
brewers in Cockburnspath, and for many years there has
not been one in the parish till Whitsunday 1791.-The
present number of souls, by an exact account taken in
April 1793, is 883; of these 406 are males and 477 fe-
males.  At an average, the births for 10 years, from 1721
