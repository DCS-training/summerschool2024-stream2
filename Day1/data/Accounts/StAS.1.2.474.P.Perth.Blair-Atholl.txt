as thick.  It stood perpendicular, all under ground, and firm
ly propped in that posture with small stones.
   Above a furlong to the eastward of this stone, are two cas-
tles, nearly round, on the top of a pretty high ridge, above a
gun-shot from the high way, a few paces from each other,
having double, and in some places triple ditches.  Before the
gates stand several obelisks, in a zig zag position; probably
for the protection of champions, that defended the entries,
and to obstruct the enemy's access.  These seem to be of a
later date, than the other round castles.
   About a quarter of a mile to the westward of the castles,
and along the Garry, lies, Erlein-an righ, i. e. King's Isle,
quite level; below the castles are Dalruinich, i. e. Dail-ruith-
nan-each, the Plain of the Running of Horses; and Dail an-
nonuich, the Plain of Galloping, or Horse Races.  From
the situations and names of these, it is more than probable,
that herse races, and perhaps other games, were celebrated
here, particularly when the kings of Scotland came to the
hunting.  For them too, it is probably, the two castles above-
mentioned may have been built.
   Half a mile above the castles, and near Clunemore, still en-
tire, is a sacrificing cairn, 60 geometrical paces in circumfe-
rence, having several large slags on the top, which probably
constituted the altar; and, hard by it, two obelisks, seeming-
ly a part of a cirlce or temple.  Above a mile N. W. of this
cairn, on the bank of the Fonder, stands Tulchan, (i. e. the
little hall,) another cairn, much larger than the former, and
so old, thant the soil has, an a great measure, covered the
stones.  Betweixt these two cairns, to the westward of Lude's
House, ran, in a S. W. direction, a line of small cairns.
Whether they were a part of the great Druidical work, or the
graves of men killed in battle, is hard to say.  The soil being
good, the plough has overtuned most of these ancient works.
