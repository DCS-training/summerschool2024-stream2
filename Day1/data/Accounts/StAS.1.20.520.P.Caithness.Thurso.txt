oatmeal and bear, or bigg, yearly; whereas now the ave-
rage does not exceed 18000 bolls; one-third of that quan-
tity being bear, and two-thirds oatmeal.
   But what may be lost to the country by a decrease in the
exportation of corn, is fully compensated by the increase in
the exportation of fish, as to which, a more particular de-
tail will be given in the next chapter.

   SECT. III.  Foreign Commerce.-The foreign trade at the
port of Thurso is very inconsiderable, especially in war
time.  In times of peaces, when bear and meal were low in
price at home, considerable quantities of both, particularly
of bear, were exported to Norway; in return for which,
the vessels employed in this trade imported cargoes of wood
and salt, and sometimes French wines, but of an inferior
quality.  This, with now and then a cargo of fish, consti-
tuted the foreign commerce of the port; but since the com-
mencement of the present war, there has been no foreign
trade at all, a few cargoes of wood only excepted.

   SECT. IV.  Navigation and Shipping.-There are at
present belonging to the town and port of Thurso 16 deck-
ed vessels, (eight whereof belong to the town solely0; whose
tonnage together amounts to 858 tons.  These are all em-
ployed in the coasting trade and the herring fishery.
   The number of boats within the district may be about
130; and allowing 6 men to each boat, being the usual com-
plement, there are 780 fishermen along the coast.  But then
it is to be observed, that of the above number, only 6 boats
and about 40 men, (and these reside at Thurso), are con-
stantly employed in fishing; the rest are farmers, tradesmen,
or day-labourers, as well as occasional fishers; and, useless
in the summer, during the herring-fishing season, fishing to
them is but a secondary object.
