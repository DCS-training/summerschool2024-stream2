here, considering the size of the place.  This trade could
not fail of introducing additional wealth, and its conse-

either of the other two boroughs of the county.  For these,
lying at the extremities of the shire, do not feel so much the
advantages of local situation, and have not been happy enough
to experiences in the same degree the favours of fortune.  Of
the three boroughs, Dingwall is accordingly by much the most
flourishing.

business of the shire.  The convenience of gentlemen, and
he interest of the people, both require that it should have
his privilege.
