the water of Cessnock, which runs through part of the parish,
and, in one place, forms the boundary betwixt it and Galston.
Irvine-water produces excellent trouts.  Sometimes salmon are
catched in it.
   There is nothing peculiar in the climate of this parish.  It
is subject, along with the other parishes on the west coast of
Scotland, to frequent falls of rain.  The weather is thus, at
times, very variable; the inhabitants, nevertheless, enjoy a
good state of health: nor are there any diseases peculiar to the
parish.  Although there be not many instances of people ar-
riving at a very great age, yet not a few reach their 60th and
70th year.

   Population.-Where the returns were made to Dr. Webster,
the number of inhabitants in the parish amounted to 745: they
are now increased to 1000.  The increase has taken place in
the village.-There has been no register of burials kept in the
parish for many years past: the annual average of births for 5
years preceding 1792, was 38; and of marriages, 12*.

   Rent.-The valued rent is L. 4000 Scotch.  The real rent
will amount to upwards of L. 4000 sterling per annum.  Farms
let from 15 s. to 30 s. per acre, and contain from 60 to 150 a-
cres each.-There are 8 large proprietors of lands in the pa-
rish, with a few smaller ones.  Of the greater proprietors, 3
either constantly or occasionally, reside in the parish.
