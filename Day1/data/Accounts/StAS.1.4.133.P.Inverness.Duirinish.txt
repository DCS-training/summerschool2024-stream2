last of these transports failed on the 6th of this month (Oc-
tober 1790) from Loch Bracadale.  These 8 ships have, at
a very moderate computation, carried away from this island
2400 souls, and L. 24,000 Sterling, Ship-freights included.
From the year 1772 to 1775, 204 males, and 207 females,
emigrated from this parish to America, exclusive of those
who have gone in the two last ship; yet the population
appears to be as great as in 1772.  This increase of popu-
lation may be attributed to a more judicious and rational
treatment of children an women in child-bed, than was
formerly observed; and above all, to the inoculation of the

a boat with fails.  There are 4 students from this parish
who attend the Universities of Aberdeen.  There are 7
established clergymen in this island, viz. 5 on Lord Mac-

habitants of Sky are Protestants, of the established Church
of Scotland, a very few excepted, who are of the Church
of England; yet these persons re endued with such libe-
