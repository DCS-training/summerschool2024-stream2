would accept of such a disgraceful pittance.  In these times,
when there is such a general rise in all the necessaries of
life, what progress in learning or in science is to be ex-
pected in any part of the kingdom, when that useful and
necessary set of men are depressed by poverty?

   Poor.-There are no poor in this parish, either in the
roll, or as vagrant beggars.  Economy, joined to industry,

They attend diligently to their respective business, and
reap the fruits of their own labours.  Hence we may infer,
that our public fund is increasing; hence also, an assess-

L. 4 Sterling.  It is a circumstance not unworthy of notice,
perhaps, that she draws only L. 1, 5 s. or L. 1, 10 s. for the
winter half-year, and all the rest, L. 2, 15 s. or even L. 3
Sterling, for the summer.  The store farmer is the occa-

quire 4 or 5 for the summer, in order to milk their ewes,
cut down their crops, and hoe turnips.  Hence the de-
mand for servants is greater, and of course raises their
wages.  A mason's wages are 1 s. 6 d. with maintenance,
