   Climate.-The climate is distinguished by variable,
rather than tempestuous weather.  Remote from the
mountains, which attract moisture and occasion rain, fair wea-
ther is not unusual.  The winters are generally mild and
open, frosts are seldom intense, or of long continuance.
The snow never thickens to any depth, and the coast
is scarcely sprinkled by it, while in more inland parishes it
lies to a considerable depth.  The level situation of the parish,
and the sea surrounding it on every side but one, may be re-

Canisbay, for the same reason, are temperately cool; and high
winds are, in general, more prevalent than heavy rains.  The
Aurora Borealis begins to exhibit itself about the middle

to prove that it is the effect of electricity.

   Longevity and Diseases.-There are few districts where more
good health is enjoyed than in Canisbay.  The inhabitants in
general live to a good old age.  There are several at present in the
parish betwixt 90 and 100.  Many die at an advanced age, with-
out the recollection of a day's illness in the course of their
lives.  The most prevalent illnesses among the people, are
those arising from obstructed perspiration, owing to the va-
riableness of the weather, and perhaps still more, to the raw
and unwholesome vapours transfused into the atmosphere they
breathe, from the extensive tracts of fen, muir and moss in
