   Situation and Extent.-This parish, consisting of two islands,
Gigha and Cara, forms a part of the southern district of Ar-
gyllshire, called Kintyre, from which it is divided by a chan-

trict, extending nearly from N. E. to S. W.  The island of
Gigha is about 7 English miles in length, and 2 1/2 in breadth.
Proprietors, Mr M'Neill of Gigha, Mr. M'Neill of Galla-

having few hills, and those hardly so high as the arable land
on the opposite coast of Kintyre.  In both, the soil is fertile,
vegetation quick, and the air salubrious.
