the camp stands is called Hab or Hobchester.  A little to the
South-East of this camp is a hill of no great height, but rising
abruptly, on which several unfortunate women were burnt
for witch-craft, so late as the beginning of this century.  It
is still called the Witch's Know ^.  EDINGTON CASTLE, the
ruins of which now show its former strength, also demands
our notice.  It is situated on the banks of the Whittadder,
near the southern extremity of the parish, on a sheep rock,
totally inaccessible from the West; at the foot of which the
river flows.  In feudal times, it was an excellent protection
against the inroads and depredations of our neighbours, on
the other side of the Tweed.  It has been a solid and sub-
stantial building, as what remains of the walls are composed
of immense stones, strongly cemented together.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages, attending
the situation of this parish, greatly overbalance any disadvan-
tages to which it may be liable.  Situated within 4 miles
of Berwick, (to which there is an excellent roads) the in-
habitants can with great ease procure whatever may be want-

a ready market for whatever they have to dispose of; the
farmer, in some degree, for his fat stock of every denomina-
tion, and always for his corn; and the cottager for his eggs,
butter, cheese, or sowls.  And, in like manner, they can be
supplied with whatever they stand in need of, as well and as
cheap in Berwick, as in any place in the North of England.
Whatever else the farmer has to dispose of, he there meets

about 4 years ago, but is now plowed up and cropped with the rest of the field;
a sort of supertitious veneration for the spot, where human blood had been
shed, seems to have preserved it for many years.
