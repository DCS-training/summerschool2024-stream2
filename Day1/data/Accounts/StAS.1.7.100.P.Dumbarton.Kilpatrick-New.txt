set off for Ireland; that they seeing it impossible to pur-
sue him, for it seems they were not of that class of witches
who can skim along the waters in an egg shell, or ride
through the air on a brooms stick, tore a huge piece of a rock
from a neighbouring hill, and hurled it, with deadly purpose,
after him; but that, missing their aim, the ponderous mass
fell harmless, and afterwards, with a little addition from art,

   Number and Rent of Farms.-There are two large grass
farms, which pay about 200 L. of rent each.  Of corn farms
there are 6, at 100 L. or a little above-about 50 between
30 L. and 100 L.-and above 40 below 30 L.; but among the

than when they paid but the half of their present rent.  The
raising of the rent has stimulated their industry, and their
industry is repaid in the enjoyment of more of the comforts
of life.  And the generous landlord, it is to be hoped, will
never rapaciously extort from the husbandman all that is not
