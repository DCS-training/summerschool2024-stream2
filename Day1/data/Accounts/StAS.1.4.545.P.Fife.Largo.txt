of his huts, and slept in the other, which was at some di-
stance from his kitchen.  A multitude of rats often disturb-
ed his repose, by gnawing his feet, and other parts of his
body, which induced him to feed a number of cats for his
protection.  In a short time, these became so tame, that
they would lie ahout him in hundreds, and soon delivered
him from the rats, his enemies.  Upon his return, he de-
clared to his friends, that nothing gave him so much un-
easiness, as the thoughts, that when he died, his body would
be devoured by those very cats he had with so much care
tamed and fed.  To divert his mind from such melancholy
thoughts, he would sometimes dance and sing among his
kids and goats, at other times retire to his devotion.  His
clothes and shoes were soon worn, by running through the
woods.  In the want of shoes he found little inconvenience,
as the soles of his feet became so hard, that he could run
every where without difficulty.  As for clothes, he made
for himself a coat and cap of goats skins, sewed with little
thongs of the same, cut into proper form with his knife.
His only needle was a nail.  When his knife was worn to
the back, he made others as well as he could, of some iron
hoops that had been left on shore, by beating them thin,
and grinding them on stones.  By his long seclusion from
intercourse with men, he had so far forgot the use of speech,
that the people on board Captain Rogers's ship could scarce
understand him, for he seemed to speak his words by
halves.  The chest and musket which Selkirk had with
him on the island, are now in the possession of his grand-
nephew, John Selkirk, weaver in Largo.
