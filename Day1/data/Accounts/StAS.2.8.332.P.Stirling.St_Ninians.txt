serving notice are on the Forth. These in general are either let to
people in Stirling, or so connected with that belonging to the town
of Stirling, that the account of them falls under the statistics of
that parish.
   Manufactures.--The manufacture of carpets and tartans has for
many years been carried on to a great extent in this parish. The
largest establishments are at Bannockburn; but in other parts of
the parish, particularly at Cambusbaron, active and enterprizing
manufacturers are to be found. The weavers mostly reside in
villages, though a few of them are still to be met with in the coun-
try. Including all the different brancbes,-spinning, dyeing, weav-
ing, &c., there are upwards of 1500 persons employed in this manu-
facture. When the trade is in a prosperous state, the number of
men may be stated at rather more than 830, whose weekly wages
are from 10s. to 12s.; women nearly 500, and their weekly wages
are from 6s. to 7s.; boys and girls upwards of 170, from 3s. to 4s.
per week. The annual average value of goods manufactured may
be estimated at L. 130,000.
   Tan-Works.--There are three tan-works in the parish, two in
St Ninians and one in Bannockburn. In these, 48 workmen are
employed, of whom a few are apprentices. Twenty-three are tan-
ners, and one skinner, whose wages average 12s. weekly; and
24 curriers, at ]4s. weekly. They are, in general, more healthy
than any other class of tradesmen. The value of the goods tan-
ned may be stated at L. 16,000, and the goods that are curried
at L. 12,000, of which above one-third are foreign hides, and skins
imported in the hair; and the other two-thircts are the produce
of the country around.
   Nailers.--There are 200 nailers. They make from 1000 to
1200 nails in the day. Their working hours are long, and their
wages small : 8s. or 9s. per week.
   Brick and Tile-Work.-- The only brick and tile-work in this pa-
rish is at Throsk, at which 26 men are employed: wages, 16s.
and 11s. per week.
   Distilleries.-Not many years-ago there were six distilleries in
this parish. At present we have only one, at Cbartresball. From
the 11tb of October 1839, to 11th October, 1840, they consum-
ed 23,490 bushels of barley. Formerly, there were a number of
brewers in St Ninians, now we have only one, nor does he carry
on business to a great extent,
