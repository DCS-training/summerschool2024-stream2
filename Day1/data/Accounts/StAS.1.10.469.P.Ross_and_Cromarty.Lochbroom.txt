parish are very trisling, in some years scarce amounting to
4 L. at the parish church.  And when to this are added a

   Schools.-The parochial schoolmaster has a salary of 12 L. a
year.  He is a man of very good abilities, and has been pre-

the people, with regard to every branch of literatures and
partly to the want of due encouragement from those who
should be ready to promote the improvement of the people

schoolmasters meet with too little encouragement in most
places.  It is certainly a grievance which merits redress, that
men of liberal education, so laboriously and usefully employed

are two Society schools in this parish, one at Ullapool, and
the other at Little Strath.  That at Ullapool has a salary of
25 L. a year, and is usually attended by a good number of
scholars, commonly 40 and upwards.  The teachers Robert
Monro, has been formerly ordained preacher every Sunday,
besides teaching through the week.  The school at Little Strath
has a salary of 12 L. a year, and is also pretty well attended.

their ancestors.  On these occasions their have a custom of
feasting a great number of their friends and neighbours, and
