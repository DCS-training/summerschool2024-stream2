him, whole tomb-stone is said to be lying somewhere on the
top of Glenwhurry-hill, a foot or more beneath the surface,

contrive the best, but hitherto unsuggested, at least unattempted,
method of acquiring a full and accurate knowledge of the in-
ternal state of this country; and thereby to wake the dormant
principles, and direct the benign operations of philanthropy and
genuine patriotism, is a circumstance that does infinite credit to
the character of that author, who first set on foot, and has
taken on himself, the trouble of publishing these Statistical In-
vestigations.-Consonant to this singular felicity of contrivance,
and excellence of design, are the ardour, and assiduity, exerted
