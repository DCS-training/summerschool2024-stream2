				V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	  The east end of the parish is within two miles of Anstruther, a
	sea-port, corn-market, and post-town. Pittenweem, also a sea-
	port and post-town, is within two and a-half miles of the church;
	and Colinsburgh, a corn-market and post-town, is within a mile of
	the west side of the parish. The church and manse are about
	eight miles distant from St Andrews. The produce is shipped
	chiefly at Anstruther, but also at Pittenweem and Elie. There
	are two corn mills and one lint mill in the parish.
	  The church is not centrical, being near the eastern extremity
	of the parish. It was built in l793, and is large and commodious
	containing accommodation for about 500. The chapel at Largo
	Ward affords accommodation to the inhabitants of the north-west
	part of the parish.
	  The manse and offices were built in 1820, and are in all re-
	spects substantial and commodious. The glebe is about 15 Scots
	acres. It is valued at L.30 per annum. The stipend is 16 chal-
	ders, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The teinds of
	the parish amount to 37 chalders.
	  There has not hitherto, been any dissenting meeting-house in
	the parish, the few Dissenters who reside within the bounds at-
	tending the Relief chapel at Pittenweem, or the Burgher chapel
	at Largo Ward. A Free Church meeting-house is at present
	erecting at Arncroach, but it would be premature to pass any opi-
	nion as to the support which it will receive from the parishioners.
	  It has already been stated, that Mr David Wemyss represented
	the kirk of Carnbee in the first General Assembly. In the same
	Assembly he is also mentioned among such as were thought best
	qualified for the preaching of the word, and ministering of the
	sacraments at St Andrews, and he was afterwards settled there.

<Footnote>The above list I received from the Rev. H. Scott of West Anstruther, who with
	great labour has made up similar lists for most of the parishes in Scotland. His col-
	lection, if completed and printed, would form a curious document, and is worthy of the
	attention of some of our book societies.
