the inns are well kept, and have had no perceptible bad effects upon
the morals of the people. As several of these inss are much fre-
quented, there is, of course, collected in their neighbourhood, a
considerable number of persons necessary for the operations re-
quired in them.
               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   Although the parish generally is an improving state, yet it
is notorious that most of the properties in the parish are very
heaviy burdened, and that thus the exertions of the proprietors for
the improvement of their estates--and for the bettering of the con-
dition of their tenantry, are very much impeded.
   The orderly and kind disposition of the people merits high com-
mendation. No great vices are practised among them; they are
most observant of the offices of religion; live in good agreement
with each other, notwithstanding any differences of religious pro-
fession; and seem anxious to obey, even on hint, the wishes of
their superiors, both civil and ecclesiastical. Their respectful and
decent appearance, during the public solemnities of religion, has
gained the admiration of all strangers--and their minister would be
ungrateful not to acknowledge, that they seem, on every occasion,
to have almost anticipated his wishes.
   Still the tendency to change, which is at present abroad over the
world, may be descried by a close observer of events, event within
the hitherto quiet precincts of our retired and romantic valley; and
I have no doubt, that when a few more years have elapsed, much
that has characterized both the customs and the spirit of the people
will have been succeeded by other habits--and by new tenden-
cies of thought. But whether the change shall be for good or for
evil, is a question to which opposite answers will assuredly be given
--and which no living man, perhaps, is able to answer satisfac-
torily.
