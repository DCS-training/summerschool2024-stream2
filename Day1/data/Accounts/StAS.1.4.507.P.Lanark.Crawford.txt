duce spratts, which are often cut and made into hay.  At
the same time, it must be acknowledged, that the face of
our country is naked, and how fit soever for pasture on the
whole, there is waste ground in many places.  Forests or
natural wood have been destroyed long ago, of which,
however, there are some small remains.  As to planta-
tions either or trees or hedges, we have made but little
progress.  Stone fences are even in their infancy.  There
are a few trees, some of which are seemingly of great age,
about the castle of Crawford.  The late Mr Irvin planted
some strips round his house, which begin to dacay alrea-

at a distance from it.-One improvement has taken place
lately, which may be considered as preparative to many
others.  The public road from Douglas mill to Moffat, 
which goes through our parish, has been completed with-
in these 10 years.  The Glasgow and Carlisle carriers go
this road every week, and for 3 years past, one mail-coach
comes down, and another goes up every day.-The pro-
portion of arable ground to that of pasture, may be as 1
to 200:  Some hold it to be no more than 1 to 300.
There are several farms in the higher parts of the parish,
where grain has not been sown in the memory of man.
The proportion of the arable to the ground actually
ploughed every year, is about 1 to 20.  Our situation and
climate have been adverse to agriculture, even in our
lowest grounds.  The common oats were not ripe last
year (1790) when the frost came, which was about the
9th of October.  All our crops since 1782, one only ex-
cepted, have been hurt more or less by the frost.-Our
soil being wet and spongy, manure can seldon be pro-
