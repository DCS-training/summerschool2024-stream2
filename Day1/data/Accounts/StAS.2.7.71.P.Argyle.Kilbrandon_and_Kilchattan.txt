               PARISHES OF
      KILBRANDON AND KILCHATTAN. *

          PRESBYTERY OF LORN, SYNOD OF ARGYLE.

         I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--This parish has received its name from some one of
those.Scottish saints who, no doubt, were celebrated in their own
times, but of whom very little is now known, except that they
were companions or followers of the famous St Columba. It ap-
pears that, before the Reformation, there were four churches or
chapels within the bounds of the present parish, which were dedi-
cated respectively to Brenan or Brandon, Cattan, Bride or Brid-
get, and Coan. The placds where these churches once stood,
and where the ruins of some of them are still to be seen, are called
Kilbrandon, Kilchattan, Kilbride,,and Kilchoan. When these
four churches or parishes were united, the last two names were
dropped, whilst the other two are still retained. The parish is
generally called Cuan by the country people, from the circum-
stance that the present church stands near the narrow sound of
Cuan, (derived from the Gaelic cumhan, narrow,) which separates,
Seil from Luing.
   Extent, Boundaries, &c.--The parish is situated in that, district
of Argyle called Nether Lorn. It consist of a portion of the
mainland and a group of islands, five of which are inhabited, viz.
Seil, Luing, Easdale, Torsay, and Shuna. Its greatest length
from north to south is 10 miles, and its greatest breadth is about
6 Miles from east to west. The district on the mainland belong-
ing to the parish is about 4 miles long, and two miles broad; Seil
4 by 2; Luing 6 by 2; Shuna 2 1/2 by 1 1/2. Each of the other
islands is less than a. square mile. On the east side, the parish is
bounded by Kilninver and Kilmelfort, from which it is separated
on the north-east by the Sound of Clachan, and on the south-east,
