about 20 farmers in the parish, who still use to oxen in 
the plough; 10 or 11 farmers, use 6 or 8 oxen.  The o-
ther ploughs are drawn by 4 horses, or by 2 or 4 cattle,
with 2 horses going before them.  There are about 87
ploughs in the parish, in all.-Very few sheep are kept;
not having extensive pasturage for them.  The farmers
find it more profitable to rear cattle.  They all have cows;
and the butter of this parish has been long famous for its 
excellent quality.  It is generally fold in the Aberdeen 
market at 8 d. the pound, 28 ounces Averdupois for the 
pound; or salted for the inhabitants of Aberdeen, at that 
price.  The cheese is sold there, from 4 s. to 5 s. the stone, 
28 pounds English the stone.  Cows of a middling size,
generally yield of milk from 6 to 8 Scotch pints the day, 
and their produce for a season (i.e. butter and cheese) may 
be reckoned in value, from L. 2 to L. 3 Sterling, from 
each cow. Some farmers have cows of a larger size, which 
give from 10 to 11 or 12 Scotch pints in the day.  One 
keeps 14 large cows, the milk of which, after the cream
is taken off, is sent every day to Aberdeen, (8 miles di-
stant), and sold from 1 d. to 1 1/2 d. the Scotch pint. The 
butter made from these cows, was 2 stone weight the week, 
and sold at 9 d. the pound.-Oats are sown in the month 
of March, and first part of April, and reaped in September 
and October.  Bear is sown in April, and first part of May, 
reaped the end of August and month of September.  Tur-
nips are sown in the middle, or towards the end of June,
and used during winter.  The parish does much more than 
supply itself in provisions, besides meal and bear.  Fat cat-
tle, a few sheep, poultry, chiefly hens and ducks, are sold 
at Aberdeen.  

   Prices, Wages, Fuel, Earnings, etc.-The price of a hen
or duck is from 8 d. to 10 d.; eggs 3 d. and 4 d. the dozen,
