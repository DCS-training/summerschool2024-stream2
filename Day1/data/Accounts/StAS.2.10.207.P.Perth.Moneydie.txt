  Wages.-The wages of farm-servants vary from L. 10 to L. 14
per annum, together with 6 1\2 bolls (140 lbr. per boll) of oatmeal
in the year, and 1 1/2 Scotch pints of milk daily.  Married men have
besides, a house and garden, rent free, and as many potatoes as
they can furnish dung to raise upon their master's field.  Many of
them have, besides, an allowance of coals.  The ordinary wages 'of
women servants are from L. 4 to L. 6 per annum.  Day-labourers
receive Is. 6d. per diem, and women working in the fields from
8d. to 10d.  Harvest-work is for the most part done by threave.
which is generally at the rate of from 2 1/8d. to 3 1/8d. per threave.
  Manufactures.-There has been recently established in Logie-
almond, a flax spinning-mill, driven by water-power from the river
Almond.  It affords employment to about fifty persons, chiefly fe-
males, and natives of the country.  When trade is prosperous, as
at present, the mill is kept going throughout the whole twenty-four
hours, by means of relays of workers-one set commencing at six
o'clock in the evening, and another relieving them at six o'clock
in the morning.  There can be no question that this establishment
has tended greatly to promnte the physical comfort of the inhabi-
tants of the district, by affording constant work and good wages to
many individuals, who formerly could obtain neither.  But it may,
at the same time, be seriously doubted, whether or not these ad-
vantages are not more than counterbalanced, by the usual train of
mnral evils which the introduction of manufactures seldom fails to
bring along with it.

		V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   Market-Towns, &c.-There is no village in the parish.  Perth
is the nearest market-town, and is six miles distant.  It is also the
post-town; although there are penny post-offices at Methven and
Augh\t1ergaven, each of them at the distance of four miles.  No por-
tion of a turnpike road passes through the parish: it is traversed
however, by a statute labour road, which branches off from the sub-
Dunkeld turnpike towards Logiealmond and Glenshee.
   Ecclsiastical State.- The church, which is a handsome and sub-
stantial edifice, was built about twenty years ago, and is seated for
