terial injury.  The more sagacious sheep dogs trip them over by
laying hold of one of their fore legs, and thereby effectually
prevents them from advancing a step farther.  When the
sheep finds himself thus overcome, he ceases all further ef-
fort, and lies almost motionless at the feet of the dog, until
the sheepman lays hold of him.

   Climate.-The Orkney Islands, situated at the extremity
of the island of Great Britain, can only have a land breeze
from two or three points southerly.  As the wind, in every
other direction, comes from the German, Northern, or At-
lantic oceans, it must necessarily be damp and cold.  That
this is the case in Orkney, will appear from the following
circumstance: Planting of wood has frequently been tried in
different places in this island, and always without success;
so long as the plant is sheltered by surrounding houses, or
high walls, it will make progress; but, where these are want-
ing, it may indeed live, perhaps for ages, but will never be
able to reach its natural perfection.  A plant of ash, for ex-
ample, 3 feet in height, may, in the course of 7 years, equal
a wall of 6 feet high; but it might stand a century without
gaining 3 feet more in height, or 3 inches more in diameter.

   Agriculture.-The only kinds of grain usually sown here
are a small kind of barley, and small grey oats.  Now and
then, a few people, by way of trial, sow white oats and pease,
an experiment that has been tried repeatedly for generations
past, and which every new comer from the south country may
perhaps repeat for generations to come; but of which the
advantage will never be so apparent as to bring it into gene-
ral practice.
   It may be asked, What should hinder white oats from
growing here?  The answer may perhaps be this, The situ-
