Should any man be 8 or 10 days behind his neighbours,
he will have woe enough in harvest.  How soon the oats
are cut down, they are hurried into the yard.  All the
cattle are left to their liberty; and he whose corns are
unripe, must cut them down, or expect to have them de-
stroyed.  By the middle of October, hunger and cold
force home the half starved cattle from the hills; the
hill-dikes are too weak to keep them out; and it is
equally impracticable to poind these invaders, as to pre-
vent their incursions.  They must be hunted with dogs
to the mountains, perhaps after a dozen of them have
run through fields of standing corn.  The hopes of any
improvement, or better management, are very re-
mote.  The great number of heritors concerned in one
piece of land, will be found a great bar to improvements
whenever they shall be attempted.  In one town of land,
as it is called, consisting of about 60 acres, and with 8
farm-houses, besides cottagers houses, 11 heritors have an
interest.  A very few farmers derive some considerable
profit, by selling peats to the towns of Kirkwall and
Stromness:  Others are obliged to spend most of the sum-
mer in cutting, winnowing, and leading peats to their land-
lords.  But even those who are not bound to such ser-
vices by this article, often spend the best part of the sum-
mer about what setches them a small trifle of money;
when, in all probability, the same time employed in dig-
ging and leading marl for their land would give them 
vastly more profit, though not so immediate.  But the
farm is neglected for a cow's hide, and a few shillings,
or a few stone weight of meal, to help to maintain them
while employed in the peat moss.  The principal heritor
in Stenness does not reside in the country.  His tenants
