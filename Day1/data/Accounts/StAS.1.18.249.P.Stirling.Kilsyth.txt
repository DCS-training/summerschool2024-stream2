have been justified by the facts, it is certain that at least, in
this parish, "Satan was divided against himself."
   Others, with more candour and charity, have considered
the remarkable circumstances to which I allude, as more the
effect of enthusiasm, than of delusion.  A great part of the
established church, who were not eye witnesses of what really
happened, were of this opinion at the time; and it is perhaps
a common opinion still.
   They have endeavoured to account for the unusual agita-
tion and religious concern which then appeared among the
people, by the influence of natural causes alone.  They have
ascribed them to the influence of passion, of hope, and fear, and
sympathy, and example, or to all these causes united.  They
have told us, that the instruments of that work addressed
the passions of men, more than their understandings; that
those on whom the chief impression was made, were almost all
affected in the same way, and expressed themselves in similar
language; that the agitation of one was communicated to the
multitude, and acted like a charm on their sympathetic
feelings.
   This representation is plausible, but it is only plausible.
With the candour of a Christian, and the affection of a bro-
ther, I would ask those who have urged it:
   1st, Is it possible to preach the gospel in its native simplicity
and purity, without addressing the hopes and the fears of
mankind?  Where these passions have heen addressed, has the
effect been uniformly the same, as at Kilsyth in 1742?  The
reverse is certainly the truth, though we are all men of like
passions with our fathers.  Why are men who are addressed
in the same manner, so much more cold, and careless, and
lukewarm, than the people who were distinguished at that
time?  And why was it that under the same ministry and the
same means, the same effects were not produced, even in 1742,
