     NUMBER XXX.

     PARISH OF CULSALMOND.

     (County of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Dr. WILLIAM M'LIESH.

     Name, Extent, etc.

   THE name of the parish is Culsalmond.  It is situated in
the county and synod of Aberdeen, and presbytery 
of Garrioch.  In length it is three and one half miles, and in
breadth three miles.  There are two little hills in the parish,
called Corsdow and Culsalmond, which are covered with heath,
and abound with fine blue slate, which is carried to consider-
able distances.  The rest of the parish is quite level, and of
a deep fertile soil.  The air, in the spring, is a little foggy,
but very few distempers prevail.  The only river is the Urie,
running the whole length of the parish; but, as it is small,
trouts alone are caught in it.  The distance from the sea is
25 English miles.

   Population.-With regard to the population of the parish, this
can be traced no farther back than 36 years.  It was then more
populous than at present, owing to the improvements made by
the proprietors, which led them to take much ground into their
own hands.  But as the whole parish, in the course of 25 years,
has gone to new owners, the population is increasing by people
