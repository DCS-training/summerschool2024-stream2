Highlanders and Yorkshire people prefer hogs in proportion
to their blackness, thinking they are hardy bred in high or
mossy land.  This may be a reason of smearing hogs heavily.
There is no getting a very satisfactory account of smearing
from the farmers:  Some say it forms the wool into a wax-
cloth, keeping the sheep warm and dry; some say the tar is
necessary for this purpose; John Murray, before mentioned,
apprehends the butter sufficient for this purpose, and that the
tar is only necessary to kill vermin.  Some farmers keep a
few sheep perfectly unsmeared, for pettycoats and stockings;
they say they have perhaps more wool, but they think the
wool degenerates in quality and quantity the succeeding year;
and even the first year the experiment is not fair, as they al-
ways select for the purpose the strongest and fattest sheep of
the flock.  They apprehend, too, that they fail sooner.

   The greatest improvement that has been lately introduced
in sheep farming is light stocking.  The sheep are better,
and the risk of death is also by that means diminished.  It is 
not practicable by any other means than light stocking, to in-
crease the winter food of the sheep through Tweeddale; the
arable land bearing so very inconsiderable a proportion to the
hill ground.  Plantations, in different parts of the sheep farms,
would be of great use for protecting the sheep from storms;
but on a 19 years lease, which is the usual term, no farmer
will plant.  On the 57 years leases lately granted by the Duke
of Queensberry, farmers are planting trees for this purpose at
their own expence.  In some of the breeding farms in Lin-
ton, the farmer keeps a stock of breeding ewes; of their lambs
he keeps a part, to replace the superannuated ewes and rams
which he annually sells off.  He selects the best for that pur-
pose:  He also keeps a portion of the next best lambs for sell-
ing as hogs next year to the Highlands.  The worst portion
