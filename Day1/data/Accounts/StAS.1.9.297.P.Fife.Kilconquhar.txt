craig and Grange; the castle of Rires merits particular
notice, situated on a high eminence, commanding a most
extensive view, and intended, it would appear, for a place
of defence; it is surrounded by a ditch 70 feet wide,
whose depth cannot now be ascertained with accuracy, by
reason of the alterations time has made on the ground:
No planting remains about it, excepting one remarkable
tree, called 'the Bicker tree,' measuring 14 feet round,
and its branches extending about 75 feet; that part of the
tree where the great branches separate from the trunk,
affords a very agreeable seat, and shade in summer; and
tradition says, that one of the hospitable proprietors, after
liberally entertaining his guests in the castle, was wont to
conduct them to this tree, and give them an additional
bicker there: In those days, it was usual with people of
rank, to drink out of wooden cups or bickers tipped with
silver.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 4 dumb people in
this parish.  One became dumb after he was 4 years of age,
in consequence of a stroke on the head: He enjoys the
faculty of hearing in perfection, and is abundantly intel-
ligent and active.  Another articulates a little, and is quite
deaf, occasioned by a fever; two of one family have been
both deaf and dumb from their birth: All the 4 are abun-
dantly sensible and active, and attend public worship regu-
larly.-The common people in this and the neighbouring
parishes, pronounce the diphthong oi with a long and broad
accent, giving it the sound of ow, for instance, they make
no distinction of sound, between boil and bowl.  They use
the Scots dialect; some names of places are derived from
Gaelic, as Balcarres, 'the town of sheep,' Kincraig 'the
'end of a rock,' etc.
