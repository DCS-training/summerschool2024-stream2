mers practised is now generally adopted; fewer horses are em-
ployed, and in some instances without a goadman.
   The ploughing matches that have been instituted in diffe-
rent parts of the country, have been accompanied with very
good effects. A plan of this kind has once and again been at-
tempted here.  Under the patronage of a number of gentle-
men in the neighbourhood, a ploughing match took place on
the 22d March 1794, at which 17 ploughs started, and about
L. 12 ster. was distributed in different sums to the 7 best
ploughmen, and a small gratuity to the rest.  Such well-jud-
ged encouragement must stimulate our farming servants to ex-
cel in this important part of practical husbandry.

   Disadvantages; and Projected Improvement.-The want of
coal is one principal disadvantage under which this parish
labours.  We have none nearer than Bannockburn and
Auchenbowie, either of which is at least 12 miles from the
village of Kippen.  There seems reason to believe that coal
may be found in the lands of Glinns and Balgair in this
neighbourhood.  Attempts for that purpose have repeatedly
been made in there places, as well as in the lands of Buchly-
vie, but hitherto without the success that might be desired.
The acquisition of coal so near would be of vast importance
to this part of the country.
   We have lime at no great distance, and even within the
parish.  As the limestone however contains a considerable
portion of sand, it is thought not to suit the dryfield so well,
though proper for the carse lands.  But as the coal necessary
to burn it cannot be procured but at great expence and trouble,
most farmers, especially in the middle, and east end of the
parish, find it more for their advantage to drive lime from
Stirling shore, to which it is brought up the Forth from the
Earl of Elgin's lime works, or from the estates of Sauchie and
