              The largest sum total of deposits in the bank in any one year
            was L. 346, 9s. 6 1/4d; and the greatest number of depositors at
            any one time has not exceeded 47. In the year 1832, a panic
            arose as to the investment of the money belonging to savings banks
            in the national funds,-in consequence of which, though not un-
            connected with other causes, more than one-half of all belonging
            to the Errol Bank was withdrawn.  In the year ending June 1,
            1836, the institution began very slightly to revive, so that L. 18,
            l0s. of new deposits were received,; and in the year ending in
            June 1837, a farther increase has been received of L. 16 2s. 6d.
            only L.4, during the whole of these two years, having been
            withdrawn.  The number of depositors is at present 16.  They
            generally belong to the class of operatives, though there are a few
            farm. labourers and servants.  The existing regulations of the bank
            do not admit of any individual increasing the am"ount of his depo-
            sits beyond the sum of L. 10.
              Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
            for the last tweiaty-five years who have been  parochial
            aid, is 68.  Of these 42 have been regular poor, and 26 occa-
            sional.  As one time, in the , course of that period, (1821,) the
            whole who received parochial aid were so numerous as 90.  At
            present, they do not exceed 56 including two lunatics in asylums,
