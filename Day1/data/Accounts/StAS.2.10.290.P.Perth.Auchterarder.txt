are nine feet thick, and cemented so firmly that it is almost as dif-
ficult to tear them asunder as to quarry the rock. Half a mile to the
east of this, there are the remains of an old church, commonly cal-
led Saint Mungo's, evidently an erection of Roman Catholic thles.
There is another ruin in the parish, the old church of Abruthven.
This parish appears to have been united to Auchterarder, before
the Reformation.  The minister, however, of the united parishes
continued to live in the manse of Abruthven, and often preached
in that church. Here is the burial-place of the Dukes of Montrose.
Their aisle is an elegant and chaste piece of architecture, surmount-
ed by a well executed urn, which, seen from the public road, has a
good effect.  In this ducal mausoleum, raised upon pedestals, are
five crimson-coloured coffins, decorated with plates and escutcheons.
In the vault beneath, it is said there lies a long line of illustrious
ancestors-men distinguished for arms and address, and for excel-
lent endowments of body and mind.

be relied on as correct.
