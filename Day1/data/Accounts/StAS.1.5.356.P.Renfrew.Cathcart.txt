   Manners and Character.-The manners and character of
the people here, as well as in all other parishes, are vari-
ous.  It would ve doing injustice to many individuals of 
every station, not  to make many favourable exceptions; 
but, at the same time, it must be acknowledged, that the 
neighbourhood of so great a city of Glasgow, has perhaps 
unavoidably, a very pernicious influence of the morals of 
the inhabitants.  The frequency of their communication,
with that town, has extended their knowledge, at the ex-
pence of their virtue; and they have acquired a taste for 
many of those vices, which flourish luxuriantly in so rank 
a soil.  Converting, not with the moderate and rational 
part of the citizens, but the violent and intemperate,
they imbibe their notions, which they transplant with 
them into the country, greatly to the annoyance of their 
more peaceable neighbours. Thus, there is reason to la-
ment the decline of that primitive innocence, and simplici-
ty of manners and character, by which people, living in
more remote situations of the country, are happily distin-
guished.
