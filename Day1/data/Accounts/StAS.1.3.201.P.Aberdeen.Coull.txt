   Antiquities.-About a mile and a half west of the manor,
are to be seen the remains of a Druidical temple.  The
place is called Tamnavrie, which signifies the Hill of Wor-
ship, but there is nothing to be seen but a few large stones,
some of them standing upright, others fallen down, without
any appearance of figures or inscription.  The most remark-
able fragment of antiquity, in this parish, is the Castle of
Coull; it is situated about one-fourth of an English mile
south of the manse.  Not many years ago, there was scarcely
any thing to be seen at all, but a number of little green hills,
and the remainder of an old wall, about 30 yards long, and
10 or 12 feet thick; the ruins were buried in the ground,
and might have continued hid from mortal view, had not a
scarcity of manure induced people to dig about the old wall
for rubbish; in doing this, they came upon the remains of 
four gates and five turrets, of very extraordinary dimensions.
These last, as nearly as can be guessed, for it is impossible to
measure them exactly, on account of their broken state, will
be about 18 or 20 feet diameter; the walls in those places
which seem most entire, are 15 feet thick, built with
lime and stone throughout; one of the gates, which is not so
much demolished as the rest, is closed above with a Gothic
arch of free stone; this gate is 9 feet wide, 12 feet high, and
15 feet thick.  The whole work, as far as it can now be tra-
ced, appears to have been a square, measuring about 50
yards on each side.  It is only a very small portion of it that
is yet opened up; three sides of it, in a great measure, are still
under ground.  Among the rubbish dug up, were found se-
veral small pieces of silver coin, with this inscription:
"Alexander Rex Scotorum."
