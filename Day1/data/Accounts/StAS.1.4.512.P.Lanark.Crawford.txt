which makes part of their pay.  They work in the mines
only 6 hours in the 24.  Having therefore a great deal of
spare time, they employ themselves in reading, and for this
purpose have been at the expence of fitting up a library,
out of which every one who contributes to the expence re-

I shall only farther observe, that the lead has for several
years past been found very plentifullly; and that it fetches
a much higher price at market than it did 10 years ago.
The Earl of Hopetoun receives the sixth bar for rent.  His
bailie, who sees all the lead weighed, and that for the rent

nearly in the proportion of 10 to 18; that of 1790 amounting
to within a very few bars of 18,000; whereas that of 1786
amounted only to 10,080.  But the product of 1786 is
looked upon as a very bad crop.  The price of lead rose
considerably after the conclusion of the American war.  At
one time it was about a third more.  I am told, that at pre-
sent it has rather falllen a little; and that the chief vents
for it are Holland and Russia.

these 15 years, were in the form of run-rig.  These free-
doms were not freeholds; they were all holden of superi-
ors, either of the Crawfords or Douglasses.  Besides the
masters of these freedoms, who were called Lairds, and their
wives Ladied, there was a subordinate rank, who seued
ground for a house and a yard.  Each freedom consisted of
4 or 5 acres of croft land, parcelled out in all the different
parts of the town, with a privilege of keeping a certain
