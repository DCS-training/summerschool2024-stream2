   The practice adopted by many, of giving short leases of
of farms, by others of giving no leases, and by all of giving
very scanty encouragement to meliorate the soil, on the part
of the heritors; and, on the part of the tenants, a pertinacious
adherence to old customs, and to the method of farming used
in Orkney, more than a hundred years ago, have hitherto
been found great obstructions to improvements in Agricul-
ture.
   Man Orkney estates are of small extent: Parcels of land,
belonging to one heritor, ly interspersed, or run-rig with
those belonging to other heritors, one or more.  The udal
tenures, by which many small portions of land are held, ren-
der their conveyance cheap and easy, and such property, in
some respects precarious; for who can deny, that the poor
man's little ewe lamb is much exposed to be carried off with
the large slocks of his wealthy neighbours; or, to be secret-
ly devoured by some beast of prey, or ravenous bird ll.

The tenants wives went regularly, about the term of Lammas, to the
feuars wives, their landladies, with presents of butter, cheese, eggs etc.
hence called Laminas presents.  The Christmas bummacks are almost uni-
versally discontinued; but, in some instances, the heritors have, in heu of ac-
cepting such entertainments, substituted a certain quantity of meal and malt
to be paid to them annually by the tenants the practice of giving annual
presents at Lammas is not universally kept up by the tenants wives; but
there are not wanting instances where it is still found to subsist.
   Heritors and tenants are now become more wealthy than their ancestors.
The steel-bow, or stocking on the farms, hath, in general, been purchased by
the tenants, and a recent influx of wealth, chiefly owing to the manufacture
of kelp, hath occasioned a very great change in this country, on the state of
Landed property, mode of living, and manners of the inhabitants.
