pected than such a measure, something more than the cor-
rection of abuses, and the removal of deficiencies, which the
lapse of years alone has introduced: for it is hardly to be
supposed that the plans of our ancestors, however excellent
and comprehensive for the times when they were delineated,
were so perfect as to be for ever incapable of extention or
improvement.  Pity it were, then, that any reformation should
be undertaken on a scale so inadequate to the enlarged views
of the present day, or that any remedy should be applied,
which would operate only partially, and produce at best
but an imperfect and fleeting cure.  The pens of many emi-
nent modern philosophers have been employed on the theo-
ry of education, and from their united labours much assistance
might be derived in improving and reforming the state of
our schools.  After such names as those of Milton, Locke,
Rousseau, Priestley, and many others, it might be deemed pre-
sumptuous, in an obscure individual, to offer even a few hints
on the subject; were it not to be observed that the attention
of these writers has not been minutely directed to the educa-

indeed, whose early patriotism has not passed unnoticed, and
two or three natives of the continent, whom, at the present
