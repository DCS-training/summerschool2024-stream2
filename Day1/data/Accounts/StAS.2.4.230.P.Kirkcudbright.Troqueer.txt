interest of some smaller sums bequeathed by a few individuals.
The teacher has the usual wages, but no dwelling-house. Two
otherschools are taught in Maxwelltown, the masters in which have
no emoluments but the wages. The number of scholars in these
three schools may be 250.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The poor on the roll may be
100. The funds for their support, arising from proclamations,
interest of mortified funds, mortcloth fees, collections at the
parish church, donations, and one-third of the chapel collections,
amount to about L.140 annually, which affords but a miserable
pittance for the support of so many, and is one proof among a
thousand others, that a provision for the aged and infirm should,
in no country, be left to the unsteady and capricious impulse of
compassion, but be enforced by positive statute. Indeed, in a
parish such as Troqueer, where many of the heritors do not re-
side, and several of those who are resident attend other places of
worship, and contribute nothing to the poor on the roll, a poor's
rate, with all its predicted evils, would, if properly managed, be
the cheapest, the fairest, and the most effectual mode of main-
tainig the native poor.
	Fuel.--Coal is the fuel chiefly used by the inhabitants, which
is partly conveyed by land from Sanquhar, a distance of twenty-
seven miles; but chiefly by sea from the coal-pits on the opposite
coast of England. The first is sold by weight, the last by mea-
sure, and almost always at a moderate price.
