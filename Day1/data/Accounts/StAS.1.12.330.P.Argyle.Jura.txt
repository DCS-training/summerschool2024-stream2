   Antiquities, etc.-The remains of several Romish chapels
are to be seen in Colonsay.  There was a monastery of Cis-

its priory in Oronsay.  The remains of the abbey were, with
Gothic barbarity, torn asunder not many years ago, and the
stones put into a new building.  The walls of the priory are
still standing, and next to Icolmkill, is one of the finest reli-
gious monuments of antiquity in the Hebrides.  No metals
of any kind, so far as I could learn, have been discovered in
Colonsay.  There are great quantities of sea-coral on the
shores, and it proves a very good manure.

them, they cannot be admitted.  The assistant preacher resides in Colonsay, but
there is no proper house built for his accomodation; and there is no church
to shelter the people from the inclemency of the weather.
