   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
 receiving parochial aid is about 40, and the allotment to each
 yearly is from 3s. to 15s. The average amount of annual contri-
 butions for the poor is about L.20, whereof there is from church
 collections L. 14, and from the heritor L.6. No legal assessment
 has been imposed.
   Fuel.-This articl‚, so very necessary for the existence and
 comfort of man, nature has provided in great abundance. Tracts
 of moss are open to all, and at no other expense than that of cut-
 ting the turf, and drying it by exposure to the action of the at-
 mosphere.
