              THE REV. GEORGE RITCHIE, MINISTER.

                   I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   THIS parish consists of the four islands, Rousay, Eagleshay,
Weir, and Enhallow, besides two Small holms or uninhabited
islands. These islands are situate about,nine miles north-west of
Kirkwall.
   Rousay, the largest, is one of a range of hills. It abounds
with game, and contains many springs of excellent water. The
soil is good. There are the remains of a small church about five
miles from the manse.
   Eagleshay.-This is a pleasant, low-lying island, with a small
Gothic church in the west part of it, which was dedicated to
St Magnus, the tutelar saint of Orkney. It has a pyramidical
steeple at the west end, and a vaulted choir at the east end, which
joins to the body of the church. In Eagleshay, there is a small
lake of fresh water; and the soil is very good, and fit for culture;
but it is poorly cultivated. There is a small bay of shell sand, of
the best kind, on the west side of this island, and a large track of
sand on the north side, with much bent, and many rabbits.
   Weir.-Weir Island its a small low-lying island, not so large
as Eagleshay. The soil is the same, and the culture very poor.
There are the ruins of a church here, and a,choir, but no steeple;
and the vestiges of a fortification on a rising ground, a little from
the place where the church stands.
   Enhallow.-Enhallow Island is very small, but very pleasantly
situated, being overlooked by the bills and headlands of mainland
on the south, and of Rousay on the north. The soil is good, but
not skilfully managed.
