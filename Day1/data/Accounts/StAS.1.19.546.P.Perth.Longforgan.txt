horses or cows, and is afterwards ploughed up for the crop
of oats or wheat to follow; so that the farmers here have
no old grass.

   Bees.-Bees thrive well in this parish, and produce ex-
cellent honey; and in the gardens at Castle-Huntly, where
there are a variety of fragrant flowers, particularly great
quantities of minionette, sown on purpose, honey has been
got little inferior to Minorca, both in colour and flavour.

   Hops.-It is very probable hops might thrive here, as, in
many places, the soil is abundantly rich for that purpose;
but shelter is wanting.

   Seed-time.-Seed-time for wheat, September, in the clay;
October, and even November, on the brae land; accord-

especially in clay, while the ground is dry, otherwise
they run a risk of losing it altogether:  But in the loam or
brae land, they do not with to sow before the middle of
October; and good farmers are not anxious that such
grounds should be too dry, but rather prefer moisture,
should the harrows even trail, while they are sowing; as
they think it a great mean of preventing annual weeds from
rushing up amongst the crop.  Beans are frequently sown
in the clay upon the wheat-stubble in broad cast, land plough-

is, as soon as the plough can touch the ground; and about a
fortnight, or a longer time afterwards, some farmers sow
hasty pease upon the same furrow, and harrow them in,

the ground should be prepared by a winter furrow, and in
