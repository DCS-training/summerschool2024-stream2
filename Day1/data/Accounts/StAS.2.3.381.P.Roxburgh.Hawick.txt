northerly direction to the distance of more than two miles, occa-
sionally flowing with great rapidity over a very rugged channel,
which, in some places, is skirted with banks of bare rock, rising al-
most perpendicularly to a considerable elevation, and crowned with
plantations of young wood, which add not a little to the beauty of
the surrounding landscape.
   The Slitridge falls into the Teviot immediately after passing
through the town, which it divides into two parts, the one stretch-
ing to the east along the banks of the united stream, and thd other
rising the slope of an adjoining hill to the west, which gives to
it an appearance exceedingly picturesque when seen from a little
distance, or viewed from any of the higher grounds that encom-
pass it on every side.
   These pastoral vales, with the streams that flow through them,
form the features in the scenery which present themselves most
prominently to observation, the road to Longholm passing through
the one, and that to Liddesdale through the other. In these vales,
bowever, the prospect, though beautiful, is exceedingly limited.
But, from the mountain ranges which rise between them, the view
becomes as different as it is extensive.  All around, the spectator
finds himself environed with a vast panorama of bills, rising over.
and beyond one another as far as the eye can reach, presenting the
most interesting diversities of form, now darkened, now illuminat-
ed, by the ever-shifting variations of sunshine and of shade, and
all pervaded with an air of such profound solitude and stillness as
can scarce fail to awaken in the mind mingled emotions of plea-
sure and of awe.
   Meteorology.-From a journal kept by Mr Scott at Silverbit-
ball, in the neighbourbood of the town, we have drawn up the fol-
lowing meteorological tables for 1837.  The first exhibits the mean
together with the highest and lowest range both of the barometer
and thermometer in each of the months; the second the mean of
the barometer and thermometer for the seasons, and for the whole
year; and the third, the number of days in which the weather was
fair rainy, frosty or snowy.
