none of them reside here.  Agriculture id greatly improved.

   Church and Stipend.-The church and manse were built
about ten years ago.  The stipend, including the glebe, may
be valued at L. 120.  The Duke of Roxburg is patron.

   Population.-The population, as is thought, has not varied
for there forty years past.  There are many persons between 70
and 100 years of age.  The number of fouls in the parish is
supported to be about 1000.  It is probable that the popula-
tion has diminished considerably since the year 1714; and the 
union of farms is perhaps the cause of his diminution.  The
annual average of births, from 1714 to 1750, is 37; from
1750 to 1790, is 30.  The most numerous class of artificers
are weavers; there are 30 in the village of Sprouston; 8 ma-
sons, and 4 carpenters.  There are about 60 seceders in the
parish.

   Poor.-The annual average of the poor, from 1737 to
1758, is 33; and from 1758 to 1790, is 18.  The average
of the monthly distributions to them, during the first of these
periods, (from 1737 to 1758) is L. 3: 18: 10; and the ave-
rage during the last is L.3: 19: I.  The oldest records that
could be found of the poors rates, begin in the year 1737.
The mode of providing for the poor in the shire of Tiviot-
dale, and the only legal mode, though not universally obser-
ved, in Scotland, is this:  The heritors, with the minister and
elders, have the power of making up a list of the poor, and
assessing for thier monthly maintenance.  The assessment con-
tinue six months; the heritors paying the one half, and the
tenants the other, according to their respective valued rents.
