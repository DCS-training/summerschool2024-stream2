a-day, besides whisky; and there will sometimes be from
50 to 80 employed at once in the floating.  At Gar-
mouth, this company has built 2 saw-mills, for manu-
facturing the timber after it comes down.  The one is
a windmill, and works from 36 to 40 saws.  The other
goes by water, and works from 30 to 36 saws.  The
wood belonging to this company is sent partly to Hull,
and to the King`s yards at Deptford and Woolwich, in
their own shipping; but the most considerable part is
sent coastwise, all along the N. coast, from Aberdeen to
the Isle of Sky, or sold at Garmouth to the people of
the country around, or employed in ship building.  The
greatest part of this wood is of the very best quality,
equal, it is said by competent judges, to any that is im-
ported from the Baltic, and inferior to that only in point
of size.  The largest masts are 60 feet in length.  This
company has built, since the 1786, besides a good num-
ber of boats, 23 vessels from 500 to 25 tons burden
the greater number about 200 tons, and amounting in
all to about 4000 tons; and all of their own fir wood of
Glenmore, both the plank and timbers.  Some of these
vessels they have sold; others they employ in their own
trade from Spey, and in the Baltic trade, and one was
bought for the trade to the Bay of Campeachy.  These
vessels, though wholly of fir, are thought by good
judges to be equal to those of New-England oak, from
the excellent quality of the fir.  There are generally
about 28 ship carpenters and blockmakers employed by
this company at Garmouth; about 16 or 18 sawers;
and 8 law millers, besides several other workmen.  They
build vessels by contract.  Besides the above vessels,
built by the English company, several sloops have been
built at Speymouth, during the same time, by others;
