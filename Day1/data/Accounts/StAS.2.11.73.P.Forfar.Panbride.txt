a Sabbath school regularly kept. The means of elementary in-
struction are thus sufficiently provided to the parish, and there are
no persons in the parish betwixt 6 and 15 years of age unable to
read.
	Library.--There is a parish library, consisting almost entirely
of religious publications.
	Poor.--The number of poor on the roll varies from twelve to
eighteen; and they are all maintained in their own houses. But
besides these, there is a considerable number of householders in
indigent circumstances, who receive each a boll of coals from the
poors' funds. The poors' funds, bearing interest, amount only to
L. 73; but a considerable sum arises from the mortcloth and
hearse fees, and the rent of one of the galleries in the church,
which belongs to the session; and also from the back seats in
the Panmure loft, which Lord Panmure has for some years past
permitted to be let for behoof of the poor. The average yearly
amount of collections in the church for the last seven years is
L. 37, 1ls. 10 1/4d. There are no assessments for the ordinary poor.
But there are three lunatic paupers connected with this parish, in
different asylums, the expense of whose board is L. 50; of this sum
the heritor pays one-half, and the tenants the other.
	Alehouses.--Of these there are five in this parish, and two of
them might well be spared. It is, I think, the remark of Kotze-
bue, in his Travels through Russia, that wherever he came to the
neighbourhood of a public house, he uniformly found the morals
of the people corrupted, and their character debased; and perhaps
the same observation will hold good in every part of the world,
where such haunts of idleness and profligacy are to be met with.
