arable fields, during the winter and the spring.  Some of
them, indeed, are housed at that time in the night, and these
the tenants do not smear.  They smear, however, all those
which are not housed.  The latter are seldom subject to that
disease called by sheep-farmers the poke, (a swelling under
the jaw), or to the scab; but the former are frequently vi-
sited by both.  The poke, particularly, often proves fatal.
Hitherto no rate of proportion has been established betwixt
the number of arable acres which a tenant possesses, and the
number of sheep he may keep upon the common pasture.
Each keeps as many as his convenience or inclination
prompts.  The possessor of 8 acres has sometimes in the hill
sheep to the amount of double the number of the possessor
of 16 acres.  Sheelings are less numerous and less frequent-
ed than formerly, because the milch-cows are not sent there,
as they once were, in summer with the sheep.  All the
lambs in this parish are reared for sale as ewes or wedders.

   Swine.-Many families fatten one or two swine in au-
tumn with potatoes, and with, at times, a small mixture of
oats.  These they kill and cure for use, during the labours
of the spring.  They are of a hardy, but a small-sized breed,
feeding to about 9 stone weight on an average, and may be
valued at L. 1, 10s.

   Poultry.-No attention is paid to poultry, as an article
of food or of sale.  Some geese are reared, which in June
are sent to Loch Ordie, a lake amid the hills, in the back
parts of the parish, where, without any person to protect or
feed them, they live till the end of harvest, and then are
brought back to f?ten on the stubble fields.  They are sold
at 2 s. 6 d.
