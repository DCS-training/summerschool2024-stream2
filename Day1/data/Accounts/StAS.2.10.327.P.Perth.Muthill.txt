     ago, of a very large urn filled with the ashes of the dead, and
     near by it, several stone coffins, covered over with a heap of stones
     or a cairn.
        The other camp or station of the Romans was at Strageath, up-
     on the banks of the Earn, near to Innerpeffary. Its original work
     appears to have been of small dimensions, and the intended ad-
     ditious to it, seem never to have been fully executed. All its en-
     trenchments are now levelled by the plough.

                            <TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
                   In 1755, the population amounted to 2902,
                      1770,                            2640, decrease 262
                      1792,                            2948, increase 308
                      1821,                            2925, decrease, 23
                      1831,                            3297, increase 372
                      1836,                            3421, increase 124
     Thus in eighty-one years the population has increased 519, which
     has been chiefly owing to the improvement of land; for in propor-
     tion as more of it is brought under crop, more hands are required.
     The increase has been both in the villages and in the country.
            In Muthill village there are                                 1210
            In Braco village, Ardoch,                                     384
            In the country,                                              1827

                       marriages,                                                  25

       The number of illegitimate children during the last year was 6.
       Character of the People, &c--Of the inhabitants we may safely
     say, that they live comfortably and soberly, and at peace with one
     another.  We have not the temptations of a populous city to con-
     tend with-neither have we the influx of strangers to captivate us
     with their novelties and oftentimes with their vices-neither have
     we any residenters wasting overgrown fortunes amongst us, and ex-
     citing the envy or dislike of their poorer fellow men.  But wd have
     a rural and simple-hearted people, remarkably kind to each other,
     and given to "rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with
     them that weep."

                                    IV.-INDUSTRY.
       Husbandry.-This parish consists of ten estates.  About two-
     thirds of the whole belong to Drummond.
       Most of the heritors reside on their properties, and agricultu-
     ral improvements are promoted by them. This is very percep-
     tible in the draining of meadow and marshy ground, and in the
