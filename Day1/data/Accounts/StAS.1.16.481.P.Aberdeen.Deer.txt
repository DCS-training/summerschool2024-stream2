   A canal betwixt this place and Peterhead is practicable
on a very moderate expence.  Should such a measure ever
be put in execution, and long leases with progressive rises
of rent be granted, the agriculture and manufactures of this
district would be improved, and the population increased to
a degree that is at present only conceivable.
   Since the duty was taken off coals, the use of them in-

ple of miles distant from moss, they prove as cheap fuel as
peat, the procuring of which is a very tedious and expen-
sive work.  The time that would be gained by the use of
coals for agricultural improvement, is a matter of so great
importance, that nothing but want of experience could hin-

and an abbey.
   There were, not many years ago, the remains of up-

them, situated on the hill of Parkhouse, not far from the
village of Deer, is the most entire.  The horizontal stone
on the south is 14 feet long, containing about 250 solid
feet.  At the distance of about 500 yards, on the north-
east side of the same hill, were, not long ago, the ruins of
a small village, supposed to have been the residence of the
druids.  A number of little yards were to be seen all a-
round it; one of which still retains a superior verdure, and
serves now to show the spot where the village once stood.
It consisted of 50 or 60 mossy huts, from 6 to 12 feet
square, irregularly huddled together; hence it got the
