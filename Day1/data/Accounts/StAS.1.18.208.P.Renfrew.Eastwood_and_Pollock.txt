cloths, and the interest of about L. 500 of mortified money.
The average of disbursements during the last ten years, is
L. 74:2.  The Session educates besides 8 poor children.
Various charitable societies are also instituted throughout the
parish.  The object of these is to assist such persons in dis-
tress, or their widows and children, as have contributed when
in health, a certain annual sum to the funds of that society
to which they belong.  They seem calculated to do much
good, and annually disburse considerable sums.  No beggars
belong to this parish; but this want is abundantly supplied
from the suburbs of Glasgow.  Were the laws against va-
grants put in execution, and were every parish obliged to
maintain its own poor, the real objects of charity would be
much better provided than they are, and much idleness and
worthlessness would be prevented.  The money given to va-
grants is often not a relief to the poor, but an encourage-
ment to vice; whereas, when the poor are confined to their
own parish, which is obliged by law to maintain them, our
charity is bestowed only upon proper objects, with whose
case we are acquainted, and in whom we are more in-
terested.  The money given to vagrants diminishes, besides,
our ability to relieve the truly necessitous.  If a person can
spare ten pounds each year to the indigent, and gives one
half of this to vagrants, he takes five pounds from the funds
of the miserable; and by means of it perhaps encourages
idleness, drunkeness, and debauchery.
   The Session meets regularly on the first monday of every
month.  The whole disbursements are examined annually,
at a meeting composed jointly of the heritors and the Session;
a practice which is satisfactory to the minds of all partics,
and by which any subject which seems to be of importance
to the interests of the parish, can be considered with advan-
tage and effect.
