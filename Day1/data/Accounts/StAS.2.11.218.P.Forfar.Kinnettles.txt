and the pestle, it was probably invented in the earlhert ages. But,
being originally imperfect and susceptible of imnprovement, it was
gradually improved as the sphere of mechanical knowledge was
enlarged. With a view to abridge manual labour, it came in pro-
cess of time to be so constructed as to be worked by oxen and
horses. This improved form of it appears to have existed at an
early period; for we find that molae jumentariae were employed from
the very origin of the Roman republic. And as Strabo, Vitrtvius,
and Palladius inform us, that water-mills were introduced in the
reign of Julius Caesar, hand-mills were probably laid aside about
the beginning of the Christian era; and, of course, the millstone
above described, may be 1600 or 2000 years old.
	Modern buildings.--Most of the buildings in the parish are of
modern erection. The church was built in 1812, of stone and lime,
and roofed with blue slate. With the exception of the old man-
sion-house of Kinnettles, a part of the large mansion-house of Brig-
ton, the mansion-house of one of the farmers of Ingliston, the man-
sion-house and mill of Invereighty, and the mill of Kinnettles,
which was greatly enlarged and repaired in 1830,--all the man-
sion-houses in the parish have been built within these fifty years.
While those mansion-houses which were built upwards of fifty years
ago are generally built of stone and clay, and bovered partly with
gray slates and partly with thatch; those that have been built since
are generally of stone and lime, and covered partly with gray
slates, and partly with blue. But the mansion-houses of all the
proprietors and of some of the farmers are covered with blue slates.
The large and spacious spinning-mill at Douglastown four stories
high, and of proportionate length and breadth, was built of stone
and lime towards the end of the last century, and covered with
blue slate.

	The causes of the decrease of population are, non-residence to
a limited extent, emigration, enlarging of farms, and razing cottar-
towns or hamlets, of which three, called the Frouchment, Cotton
of Invereighty, and Cotton of Ingliston, were razed towards the end
of the last century, while their inhabitants, amounting to upwards
