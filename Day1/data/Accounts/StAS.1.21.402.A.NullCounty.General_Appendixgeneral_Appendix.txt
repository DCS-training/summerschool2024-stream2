has no meal in his stipend; and to hire his riding, and the
carriage of his fuel, &c.
   As, however, a clergyman can grant no security of tenure
beyond his own incumbency, and of course the tacksman
can have no security of continuance of interest, to induce
him to launch out in improvements of distant return; as by
consequence such lands must necessarily be doomed to re-
main in a state of comparative sterility:  it might therefore,
in the view of public utility, be still more expedient that the
land in such situations should be entirely taken away from
the clergyman (excepting, no doubt, what suffices for garden,
shrubbery, poultry-yard, and such like) and that a com-
pensation should be given him in an annual payment.  That
the interest of the clergyman may however at all times be
consulted, let there be no alienation of the glebe, unless
upon application of the incumbent clergyman to that effect,
or of the Presbytery in care of a vacancy:  And further, to
prevent any such measure from being applied for collusively,
let no such application on the part of the incumbent be va-
lid, without the consent of his Presbytery.  When an ap-
plication comes forward to the ordinary Judge of the bounds
in this proper shape, let it be provided for properly by law,
that the glebe shall he sold to the best advantage, by roup or
lay Jury; let the price then be divided amongst the heritors
pro rata of their valued rent; and let an addition to the sti-
pend, equivalent to the legal interest of the purchase money,
be allocated in grain upon the lands in the same ratio.

   SECOND, In country parishes where population is unfre-
quent, where labour is not subdivided, and where of course
conveniences cannot be had for hire; it may be indispensa-
bly necessary for the clergyman, in point of accommodation
to possess land.
