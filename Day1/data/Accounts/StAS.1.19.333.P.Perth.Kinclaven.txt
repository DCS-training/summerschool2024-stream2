of some importance.  One at the Linn of Campsie, on a
very small extent of the water, brings L. 80 per annum to
Lord Dunmore the proprietor.  The fall of water is not
high, but the Linn is very deep, and contains great quanti-
ties of excellent salmon.  On the Tay, about a mile from
the kirk, is Kinclaven ferry, which occupies three ferry
boats, one for foot-passengers, one for horses, and another
for carriages.  At the ferry, is a good and commodious inn,
on the Kinclaven side of the river.

   Mills.-The parish is furnished with several corn-mills,
to which the land in general is thirled or asricted.  The
thirlage in some places is considerably high.  This kind of 
fervitude is here, as well as almost every where else in
Scotland, considered as a great hardship, and an obstacle to 
agricultural improvements.  These thirlages or multures,
at the first erection of corn-mills, might have been very
just and necessary.  Now they are quite the reverse.  Why, 
therefore, should an improved society suffer an universally
acknowledged grievance any longer to exist, and impede
the most beneficial improvements of the country?

   Castle.-Kinclaven Castle, on the banks of the Tay, re-
mains in ruins.  The walls are about eight or ten feet
high; and unless destroyed by some modern Goth, will con-
tinue, for ages, to exhibit, an example of the ancient strong-
hold of Scotland.
