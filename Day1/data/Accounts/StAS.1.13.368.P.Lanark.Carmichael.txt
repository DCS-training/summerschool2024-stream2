management, many of the tenants are now laying part of
their croft under pasture, and cleaning other parts with po-
tatoes, and some with turnips.  The general crops are oats,
bear or bigg, and a few peas; the lateness of our harvests
are unfavourable to the last species of grain.  The seasons
of sowing are generally, for oats and peas, from the mid-
dle of March till towards the end of April; for bear, from
the beginning to the end of May; for turnip, from the 1 st of
June to the end of the month.  There are as yet but few
of these, and little grass fown.  They are however fairly
introduced; and as the farmers begin to see the advan-
tage of them, they are likely to be more generally
fown.  The seasons of reaping are various.  Bigg is gene-
rally cut from the 1st to the 20th of September, and oats
from that to the beginning of November.  The greatest 
improvement that has been made in any branch of hus-
bandry in this parish, is in the management of the dairy.
Farms which 50 years ago made little butter for sale, and
not as much cheese as was sufficient for the consumption of
the farmer's family, now depend upon those articles for the
payment of some, the half, and others the greatest part of
their rent.  If the produce of their cows and bear crop will
not pay the rent, it is reckoned too high.  The causes
which formerly retarded improvements in agriculture in
this parish were its distance from markets for its produce,
bad roads, and the lateness of its climate and soil.  The two
first of these are in a great measure removed.  The esta-
blishment of cotton-works at Lanark and Douglas has
brought ready markets for butter, cheese, and grain, within
a few miles, whereas formerly the principal market for the 
two first of these was Edinburgh, and For the last Glasgow,
the one above, the other near 30 miles distant, and the
roads to both so bad, that during the winter and spring
months, the general mode of carriage was upon horses-
