been scarcer, and consequently very high priced.  Last year
and this also, haddocks fold for 1 d. each, and even at 1 1/2 d.
and 2 d. for the largest.  It is true, that the few they get
now are much larger than those taken when they got great
quantities; but these they had near the shore, and might
be, and were taken there twice and thrice a-day; but now
they seldom get them, and must go farther for them, some-
times the length of Helmsdale in Sutherland.  The great-
est number of haddocks and cods used to be had in winter,
and first of spring; and most whitings, codlings, slounders
and cuddies, in summer and harvest.  They are caught
with nets, and used to be sold chiefly in the parish, and at
Tain.  Sometimes they went with boat-loads of fish to Ding-
wall, Inverness, etc.  The sea-weed is used on the coast for
manure.

   Quarries.-There is a soft freestone at Pitkery, of an in-
ferior quality, in the east end of the parish, but little used;
a pretty good freestone at Balintore; a good deal of it used
for building; but at Catboll, in the rocky part of the
coast, there is a remarkable good freestone, little inferior to
any in Scotland.

   Quadrupeds and Birds.-We have hares, foxes, rabbits,
eagles, hawks, ducks, teals partriges, owls, ravens, rooks,
plover, gray plover, with migratory birds, as the swallow
and cuckoo, swans and wild geese, etc.  The swallow and
cuckoo appear about the beginning of summer, the latter
departs early in August, and the former in September.
The gray or wild geese appear about the end of August,
and continue through the parish, and especially at the loch
of Eye, till the end of April, when they depart, to hatch
their young ones in the West Highlands.  The swans ap-
pear about the end of October, and continue about the loch
