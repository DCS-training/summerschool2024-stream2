tain 2, 3, 4, and even 5 families.  The village is principally
inhabited by weavers.  A few have begun to carry on business
for themselves: but, generally speaking, they are employed
by manufacturers elsewhere.  Some begin working the loom
at nine or ten years of age.  The females are remarkable for
spinning fine.  The village above is supposed to draw L. 500
annually for that article.  Some years ago, there was one
woman, who span to the extent of ten spindles in the

in general, expected, that the half, and in some parts the

They deal greatly in  rearing calves for the buthcers, which

   Diseases.-There is no disease peculiar to the parish.  What
has hitherto proved most fatal, is the small-pox, which returns
every 4 or 5 years.  In 1778, 18 children were carried off in
the course of a few weeks.  Some have begun to inoculate:
In every instance where tried, it was successful; but the pre-
