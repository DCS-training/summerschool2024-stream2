collected on the turnpike-roads will be sufficient to keep
them in repair, the statute-labour, which is now commu-
ted at the rate of from 8 s. to 12 s. each ploughgate,and
paid in money, will go some length in making them more
passable.  The communication of the labour into money, has
at least doubled the effective labour, applicable to the roads.
The road-money levied in this parish amounts to about
L. 30.  The turnpike-roads are deservedly looked upon as
the greatest improvement that could be introduced into the
country.  The cultivation of every field in their neighbour-

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the num-
ber of fouls in 1755, was 1897.-The population in this
parish has decreased of late years, owing to the practice of
converting several small farms into one large one, and the
abolition of pendicles and cottagers.  In the year 1784,
when the present incumbent entered on his office, the
number of parishioners on an exact survey, was found to

habitants made in February 1793, there were then in the
parish of Cargill, 376 families, containing 1720 souls.  Of
these, the males bear a near proportion to the famales.
The annual average of births for 10 years preceding 1791,
is 45; of marriages, 8; and of deaths, 17.  As some of
the people, and particularly Diffenters, are remiss in regi-
stering the births of their children, to evade the duty on bap-
tism; and others get them registered in the parishes where
they happen to be situated nearer, the information on this
subject cannot be perfectly accurate.  The number of deaths
also is no less difficult to be ascertained, because many of
the parishioners bury in other parishes, and some from other
parishes bury here.-In the parish, there are 314 trades-
men.  Of these, 152 are weavers; 20 carpenters; 16
