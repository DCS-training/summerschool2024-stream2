     NUMBER XXXIII.

     PARISH  OF  ROTHES.

     (County of Murray.)

     By the Rev. Mr G. CRUICKSHANK.

     Situation, Soil, etc.

   THIS parish lies along the bank of the Spey, on the
north side, and is in a great measure surrounded with
hills, which are all covered with heath.  The soil is general-
ly dry and sandy, and the crops are, for the most part, oats
and bear.  The culture of green crops is not very extensive-
ly practised.  There is neither lime nor marle in the parish.
Salmon are caught in the Spey, and commonly sell for 4 d.
a pound, during the months of March, April, and May, and
afterwards from 3 d. to 2 d. per pound.

   Population.-In the old parish of Rothes there are 1000
souls, and in that part of the parish of Dundurcas, which
was annexed to Rothes about seven years ago, there are
about 500, so that the parish of Rothes, at present, contains
about 1500 souls.  In Dr Webster's report, previous to the
annexation, the number is 746.  The population has greatly
increased of late, owing to a village that is built at Rothes,
which contains about 300 young and old.
