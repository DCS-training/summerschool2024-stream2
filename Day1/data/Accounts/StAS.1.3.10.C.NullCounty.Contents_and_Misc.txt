a manner as to give, within narrow bounds, a view of
the progress of human society.  The first district, (that
of Kingussie in Badenoch), is entirely pastoral; the se-
cond, (Morham in East Lothian), is employed in agri-
culture; in the third, (Moulin in Perthshire, there
is the commencement of manufactures:  From the
fourth. (Neilston in Renfrewshire), the effects of the
complete establishment of manufactures, on the man-
ners and morals of the people, may be traced.  The
fifth, (Montrose*), is a district possessed of foreign
commerce; and the work concludes with an account
of Edinburgh, as a specimen of the progress of luxu-
ry.  The very flattering encomiums, bestowed by se-
veral foreigners, of the first merit and distinction,
who have had an opportunity of examining this pa-
per, proves to what a heighth the character of the
clergy of Scotland will be elevated, by their statisti-
cal exertions.

   In a work of this nature, it is impossible to avoid
commiting a number of mistakes+.  It is even at-
tended with considerable difficulty to print a volume,
the manuscript of which is written in from 50 to 80

in the press, and in which it is also proposed to include Edin-
burgh.

+One mistake, in the 2 d volume, in justice to the able and
learned minister of Kettle, it may be proper to take notice of,
it appearing on farther inquiry, that the very important table,
given in the Statistical Account of the parish of Kettle, (vol.
IA). was suggested by Mr Barclay himself, who is consequently
entitled to the praise of that meritorious idea.
