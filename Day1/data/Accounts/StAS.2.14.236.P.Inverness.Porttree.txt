	on a lot had a son, who, in opposition to every advice that could
	be given him, by parents, relatives, and friends, would, whether
	right or wrong, be married. To provide for this son, his wife, and
	his family, there was no other alternative than to give him a
	share of the lot.  The same individual lotter has a daughter, to
	whom some youngman becomes attached ; marriage is proposed
	and agreed upon ; but in the matrimonial contract, it is express-
	ly stipulated, that this new ally of the family shall have an esta-
	blishment on the lot.
	   Thus on one portion of land, too small for the support of the
	original, there are now three families. It is easily seen that the si-
	tuation of these must be poor in the extreme. The proprietors
	show every kindness and indulgence. Their rents are not rigidly
	exacted at a term. There are instances of tenants being allowed to
	remain in arrear, some two, some three, and some even four
	years.
	   It is, however, perfectly evident that no liberality on the part
	of proprietors can render the present immense surplus. population
	in any measure comfortable. And there is, humanly speaking, no
	other way to provide for them than by emigration ; though cer-
	tainly, it would be for ever a matter of deep regret, that so noble
	a race of men should be under the necessity of leaving their native
	land and seeking an asylum on a foreign shore. But, as they are
	unable to effect this by any means within their own reach, they
	should be conveyed to any British settlement which may be thought.
	eligible-all the expense defrayed, and lands provided for them
	in their adopted settlement, by the Government of the country.
