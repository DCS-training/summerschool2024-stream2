of the different manufactories.-A Temperance Society, a Medi
co-Relief Society, an Association for the Distribution of Religious
Tracts, and a Home Missionary Society, have also been produc-
tive of good results.
  Savings Bank.-A Savings Bank was established in 1815, which
has been productive of the best results, and which is still going on
prosperously.  During the two years ended May 1815 and 1816,
the sum deposited was L. 1750, 9s.  8d., whilst the amount with-
drawn was no more than L. 21. During the years ended May 1837
and 1838, the receipts amounted to L.3066, 13s. 2 1/2d., and the
disbursements to L.2739, 1Os.  1 1/2d.  At last balance, May l838,
the gross amount invested was L.6857, 19s. 8d., and the total
number of accounts open with depositors 483.
  Pauperism.-About the beginning of last century the poor of
this parish seem to have been supported entirely from church col-
lections and other funds  in the hands of the kirk-session, and the
expenditure at that time was somewhat below L.20 per annum.
Between 1730 and 1740, recourse appears to have been had to an
assessment more  apparently of a voluntary than compulsory de-
scription, it being stipulated that the landward heritors and their
tenants should pay  one-half, the town one-fourth,  and the kirk-ses-
sion the other fourth.  In 1772, the assessment amounted to
L. 224, 14s. 3d.; but the funds of the kirk-session being found in-
sufficient to meet the proportion that fell to their share, it was
agreed from that time forward that L. 5 should be paid by them
quarterly, whilst of the remainder that was necessary two-thirds
were to be exacted from the heritors, and the other third from the
town.  This arrangement seems to have been carried into effect
until 1811, since which time the collections and other sessional
funds have, for the supply of occasional cases, been left entirely
at the disposal of the kirk-session, whilst the main burden of pro
viding for the poor has been divided between the landward  heri-
tors and the proprietors of heritable property in the town, the for-
mer being assessed according to their valued rent, of which the
gross amount is L.1159l, 11 s. Scots money, and the latter ac-
cording to the rental of their  premises, which  amounted, as ap
pears from a valuation taken in 1838, to L. 7650, 12s. Sterling.
This system is in operation at present time.  The heritors
meet once a  quarter for the purpose of imposing the assessment,
fixing the rate of allowance, and appointing a commitee of their
