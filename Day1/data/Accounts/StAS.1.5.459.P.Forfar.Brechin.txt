within the last 25 years, it has increased a full third.

   The return to Dr Webster in 1755, of the number in the whole pa-
rish, was,                                                          3181
   The number of souls at present (1790-1) cannot be estimated
under                                                               5000

   Of these, there are, in the west side of the town, (the junior mi-
nister's charge), examinable persons, above 7 years of age, attending
the Established Church,                                              1030
   Examinable persons contiguous to the town, but not within the
                       royalty,                                        14
                      in the country, about                           697

   There may be nearly about as many in the senior mi-
nister's (Mr BISSET'S) charge:  So that estimating the
number of children under 7 years of age, at the usual pro-

rish.
   The following extract from the parish register, for 6

tion of the marriages, births and deaths in the parish.
