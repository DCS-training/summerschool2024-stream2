Inchyra, and shaped its course along those grounds which
are still hollow, and remarkably low between the estates of
Glencarse and Pitfour; that it approached the hills at Glen-
doick, and continued skirting them eastward by Pitroddy,
Flawcraig, Craigdilly, Ballendean, Baledgarno, and Rossie.
That at the Snabs of Drimmie, it sent off a portion of its wa-

and Dron, directing its course eastward through that vale,
and after receiving several burns or rivulets in its passage,

mouth of the Gowrie.
   That the river Earn continued its separate course till it

theus, when mentioning the lands given to the Hay's, an-
cestors of the present Earl of Kinnoul, for their gallant be-
haviour at the battle of Luncarty, which was fought some
time in the tenth century, says, that they got a falcon's

' tween Errol and the Tay.'  If this be correct, it favours
the conjecture, that the Tay then came somewhere near
Rossie, and that the greatest part of the Carse was included
in the royal gift.  However, there are number of other
