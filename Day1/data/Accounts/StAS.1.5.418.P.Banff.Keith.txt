vous kind, and greatly fewer of the inflammatory, have
prevailed for the last 20 years; and that patients do not
now bear such liberal evacuations by blood-letting, as be-

solved.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 6 proprietors in the pa-
rish, the Earls of Findlater and Fife, Stewart of Whitely
and Achanacy, Stewart of Birkenburn, and Brodie of Le-
then.  The valued rent is L. 5332:18:4 Scotch.  The
real rent cannot exactly be ascertained, as some of the heri-
tors have declined giving any information on the subject.
As nearly as can be conjectured, it is rather above, than
under L. 3000 Sterling.  Within the present century, there
were 14 heritors in the parish, most of them resident.  Of
the 6 existing heritors, only 1 is resident, viz. Mr Stewart
of Birkenburn.

   Population.-By the return made to Dr Webster, in
1755, it appears that the population of Keith was as follows:

Protestants,   2653
Papists,         30   In all 2683.

In 1783, according to a roll, laid before the heritors and 
gentlemen of the parish by the minister, the population was
3583 souls:  At present, (1791) from a very accurate sur-
vey it appears, that there are only 3057 souls.

Of these, the number who live in          Between 30 & 40,   476
  villages, is,                    1662           40 & 50,   422
