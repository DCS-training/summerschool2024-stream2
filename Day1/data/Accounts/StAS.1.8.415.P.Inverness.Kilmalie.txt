     of Kilmalie.

you see the small isles, particularly Rum and Canna, and the
Sound that separates them from Sky, and beyond all
these, the Cullin hills, which form the west part of Sky it-
self.  Here the prospect to the east is wholly obstructed by
the upper part of the mountain.  But still every part of Loch-
eile can be easily observed, over which the whole horizon is
surprisingly equal.  One uninterrupted range of hills, which
rise, one behind another, presents no particular object worth
distinguishing.
   From the altitude of 600, or 700 yards, upward, there is
no vegetation at all, but merely rocks and stony parts, with-
out even a mixture of earth.  These parts are called Scar-
nachs.-They are quite flat, and may be walked over with-
out any detriment:-Upon entering into them, some excel-
lent springs of water are to be found.  Here one is deceived
with the appearance of a high part, which seems to be the
top of the hill.  The deception returns, and is repeated
twice or thrice before you reach the summit, which is flat,
and bears some resemblance to the segment of an arch, held
in a horizontal position.  The left side appears to be the
highest:  Hence you walk, with ease, over the flat weather-
beaten stones, that lie close to each other, with a gentle de-
clivity, and form an easy pavement to the foot.-You now
come, all at once, to the brink of a precipice on the north-
east of the mountain, almost perpendicular;-certainly not
less than 400, or 500 yards,-perhaps more, as it appears to
exceed the third part of the whole height of the hill.  A
stranger is astonished at the sight of this dreadful rock, which
has a quantity of snow, lodged in its bosom, through the
whole year.  The sound of a stone, thrown over the clift, to
the bottom, cannot be heard, when it falls; so that the height
of the precipice cannot be ascertained by that easy experi-
ment.
