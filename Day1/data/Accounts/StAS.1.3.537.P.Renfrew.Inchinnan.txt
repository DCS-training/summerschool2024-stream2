   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 30 ploughs in the
parish, all of the Northumberland chain sort, which were
introduced into this country by the above mentioned Mr
Ord.-In 1782 and 1783, the harvest here was very late, and,
in some places, the corn lay a considerably time under snow.
The general scarcity, which then prevailed throughout Scot-
land, was as much felt in this neighbourhood as any where;
but, providentially for this part of the country, a large sup-
ply of white pease was brought; and these being ground into
meal, relieved the wants of many families, who would other-
wife have been in a very miserable situation.- Small as
this parish is, there are 5 public houses in it.  It would be
well for the country in general, if there were fewer such
houses to be met with, as they often prove nurseries for va-
grants, and a ruin to the morals of youth.  Here young peo-
ple and servants frequently meet, spend their money, debauch
their morals, and render themselves unfit for the duties of their
stations.  Fond of limitating their superior in rank and for-
tune, they meet together, for the purpose of drinking and
gambling.  In some of these houses, even card tables are
not unusual; the consequence of all which is, that they get
drunk, lose their money, neglect their business, betray their
trust, and contract habits, that sometimes at last prove fatal
to them.
