mains of a considerable encampment.  On the side toward the
shore, there is a triple line of defence, with deep ditches:
from the centre of the work, the earth was scooped out, to a 
considerable depth, in the form of 3 ellipses placed longitudi-
nally, and thrown up in large mounds on the right and left.
On the side toward the hill, there were regular bastions form-
ed all along; and at the E. end, on a line with the centre, is
to be seen a pretty large mount, which seems to have been a 
place of arms.  The famous Gulf of Breacan lies between
Jura and Scarba.  The sound between these two islands is
narrow, and forming a communication between the Atlantic
and the internal sea on the coast of Argyll; the rapidity and
violence of the tides are tremendous.  The gulf is most aw-
ful with the flowing tide; in stormy weather, with that tide,
it exhibits an aspect, in which a great deal of the terrible is
blended.  Vast openings are formed, in which one would
think the bottom might be seen; immense bodies of water
tumble headlong, as over a precipice, then rebounding from
the abyss, meet the torrents from above; they dash together
with inconceivable impetuosity, rise foaming to a prodigious
height above the surface: the noise of their conflict is heard
through the surrounding islands.  This gulf is an object of
as great terror to the modern, as Sylla and Charybdis were
to the ancient mariners.  It is industriously avoided by all
who navigate these sounds: there are instances, however, of
vessels being drawn into it.  Large stout vessels make their
way through it in its greatest rage, but to small craft it proves
immediate destruction.
   It will be proper, in this place, to give a short account of
the islands at the N. end of Jura.  Scarba is very rugged,
and mountainous; it is about 3 miles long, and nearly as ma-
ny broad.  Lunga is not so mountainous, and is about 2 miles
long, and half a mile broad.  Balnahuaigh is about a mile in
