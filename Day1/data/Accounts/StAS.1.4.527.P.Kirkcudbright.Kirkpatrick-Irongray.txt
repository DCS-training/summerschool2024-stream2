habitants in general are healthy; nor has any thing like
epidemical severs taken place among them these 16
years pass.  Inoculation has taken place in part here.  The
minister while in another charge, inoculated 5 children of
his own, at two different times, with his own hand.  Upon
inoculating 3 at first, the people seemed to be shocked and
offended; but when he came to have other two fit subjects,
he warned his neighbours of his intention to inoculate these
also.  the example was followed immediately then, by the
inoculation of 30 children in the parish, by the hands of a
common blood-letter from another parish, who had perform-
ed at home.  They all did well.

   Agriculture, etc.-Farms here are from 30 to 400 acres,
and the rent of the best lands is between 15 s. and L. 1;
very little, as yet, amounting  to L. 1.  The rents lessen
as the parish approaches to moorlands.  There are several
excellent farmers in the parish, who know well how to a-
dapt the culture to the soil.  No great quantity of wheat 
is sowm, as the land in general is not so strong as to promise
luxuriant crops; and turnips are mostly given up, though
the soil is well sitted to produce them.  Great quantities of
potatoes are now planted in the country all round Dum-
fries.  The whole operations are performed by the plough.
They afford, at least, one meal in the day , for 3/4ths of the year,
to the most of families.  Part are sent to market, and some,
even at this distance, are sent to sloops, and have sold from
1 s. to 2 s. the 100 weight.  It is beleived, (by the writer
at least,) that were mo more potatoes raised than what
were 40 years ago, there would be a scarcity of provision in
most years, from the increase of population; such a vast
proportion of food does an acre of land planted with potatoes
produce, beyond what the same could afford when sown
