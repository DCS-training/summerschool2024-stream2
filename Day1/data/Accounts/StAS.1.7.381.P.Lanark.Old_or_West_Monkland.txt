   Flax-A considerable quantity of flax is railed in this pa-
rish, which is generally sown on ground well manured with
dung or lime, after one crop is taken from it.  Such ground
sets at from 4 L. to 7 L. per acre.  The Riga seed is preferred,
The time of lowing flax is the month of April, and it is rea-

10 d. will pull an acre in a day.  There are two lint mills, at
which flax is skatched and dressed, at 2 s. 6 d. per stone.  The

4 masters.  Their object is to assist members in distress; and

in dotting, tambouring, etc.; some of them begin at 8 or 9
years of age, and, at that early period, gain 6 d. or 8 d. per
day.  Though this may be profitable to one class, it is attend-

complain of the high wages of servants, and sometimes find
