decrease it may have suffered within these 20 years, is actu-
ally nigh doubled, since the late eminent Dr Webster made
up his estimate of the whole population of Scotland:

For the number of souls at present in the parish is   335
Whereas the whole population, in 1755, was only       181
                                                      --- 
 Hence there is a clear increase, of no less than     154
Of these there are males,                             148
