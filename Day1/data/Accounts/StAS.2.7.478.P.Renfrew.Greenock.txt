           The Rechabites, another society recently established in Greenock
	resemble the Odd Fellows in every respect, it is believed, except
	that they take the temperance or tee-total pledge, and forfeit
	claims on the funds by breaking it, in the same manner as if they
	failed to pay their entry-money and dues.
	   The associations last mentioned, whatsover may be their pe
	culiarities in other respects, are virtually and in effect benefit or
   	friendly societies.  Besides the above, very few friendly societies,
	commonly so called, now exist in Greenock.  Some of them were
	dissolved on consenquence of miscalculation and inability to make
	good their engagements.  The rest do not appear to be transact-
	ing business to any great extent.
	   We are informed that the Master Wrights' Society distributed
	this year L. 78, and the Master Coopers' L. 67.  The entry-
	money to the former is L. 2, 2s.; annual payment, 1s.  Old men
	and widows receive each L. 2 per annum.  There are 66 widows
	on the list of pensioners.
 	   Provident  Bank.-This excellent establishment commenced its
	operations in September 1815.  The following table will show the
	uniform and rapid progress which it has made since that period.
