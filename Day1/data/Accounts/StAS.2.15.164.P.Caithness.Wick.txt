	  Ministers of Keiss.-1827, Thomas Jolly, now minister of
	Bowden; 1829, Thomas Gun, present incumbent.
	  New Church at Pulteneytown.-It is proposed still farther to
	increase church-accommodation for the parish of Wick, by the
	building of an Extension church in Pulteneytown, capable of ac-
	commodating 950 persons.  Subscriptions amounting to L. 662,
	13s. 6d. have been obtained for this most desirable object.  The
	foundation stone was laid on March 17, 1841.
	  Missionary.-The Rev. David Mitchell has laboured assidu-
	ously, as missionary under the Church of Scotland in Pulteney-
	town, for about two years.  He is supported by subscriptions.
	  Notwithstanding the accommodation provided at Keiss and Bru-
	an, and that which is proposed to be provided at Pulteneytown, the
	parish church of Wick, though large, is altogether insufficient for
	the population.  After deducting the 809 included in the parish
	of Keiss, and the 1028 within the mission of Bruan, there are at
	present within the parish of Wick, quoad sacra, 1842 households,
	Comprising, of males, 3482; of females, 4032; total 7514.  Tak-
	ing the number of those who ought to have church-accommoda-
	tion at the proportion of 55 to the 100, there ought to be
	church-accommodation for 4132; but the parish church can ac-
	commodate only 1835; thus leaving unaccommodated 2297: Or
	if Pulteneytown ultimately shall be erected into a parish, then there
	will remain a population in the parish of Wick quoad sacra of
	6505 souls.  Of these there ought to be accommodated 3577 ; but
	the church accommodates only 1835, leaving unaccommodated
	1742: Or, making a liberal allowance for Dissenters of all de-
	scriptions, and stating their numbers at 2100, which will reduce
	the number of churchmen to 5414, of whom there ought to be
	accommodated 2977; but the church accommodates only 1835;
	thus leaving without accommodation 1142 souls.
	  But the great deficiency lies in pastoral superintendence.  It
	is altogether impossible for one single minister to superintend ef-
	fectively 7514 persons, or, making allowance for Dissenters,
	5414.  This will appear still more evident, when the prodigious
	influx of strangers, amounting to near 10,000, during the fishing
	season, is taken into consideration.  There is not a parish in
	all broad Scotland, whence issues a more urgent call for help.
	We are numerous and we are poor; and, from the fisheries
	and other causes, are exposed to many and great temptations,
