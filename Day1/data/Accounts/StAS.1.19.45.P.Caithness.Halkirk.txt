Orkney, and dedicated to that Saint, therefore called St
Magnus.  Who he was, I have not yet been able to learn;
but, from several circumstances, I have reason to believe,
that he was either a Dane or of Danish extraction; and
that he assumed the name Magnus, on his becoming so emi-
nently distinguished in the church.  Whatever he was, it
appears that he was a great and a good man, a personage
of great wealth and influence, of no less piety and benefi-
cence, and highly beloved and revered, especially in this
country and in the Orkneys, where he has done so much good.
From this circumstance it is, that there are still so many
in these countries called Magnus.  Circumstances also lead
to the belief, that he was one of the Knights Templars, so
powerful and affluent in their day, and a capital one too,
and consequently, that the lands in the neighbourhood of
Spittal Hill, to a considerable extent in this and the parish
of Warren, were the property of that society.  What
makes this the more credible is, that there is scarcely a
parish in Scotland where that society have not had lands,
and established religious houses.  Nay, so much did their
influence and wealth accumulate, that it was their ruin at
last.  They were envied and dreaded by both church and
laity, who coveted their wealth.  Hence this order was ex-
tinguished very early in the 14th century, deprived of their
wealth, and a large share of it transferred to the order of
St John of Jerusalem, who also were treated in the same
manner, as soon as their affluence made them ripe for the
rapacious hand of covetousness.  But to return from this
digression, which I could not well avoid.
   Why this religious house was called Spittal, vis. Hospi-
tal, I cannot learn*; neither can I find what kind of reli-
