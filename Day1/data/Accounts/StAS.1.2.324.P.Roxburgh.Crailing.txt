     Statictical Account

   Climate, Etc.-The climate is dry and wholesome.  No
diseases are peculiar to the parish; and the people are gene-
rally long lived.  One man died a few years ago, who was
said to be 106.  At present there are several persons in the
parish about 80, and likely still to see many years.-There
is a circumstances, which may be mentioned here, as a proof
of the mildness of the climate, and finess of the soil of this
parish, which took place in the late attempt, that was made
to cultivate tobacco in Scotland:  In one season, a tenant, in
this district, drew L. 115 for tobacco plants, and afterwards
raised a crop on 12 or 12 acres, which he sold upon the
ground, for L. 320; but an act of parliament intervening, (the
policy, or the justice of which, need not here be entered into,)
the purchases was unable to fulfill his bargain, and the farmer
was compelled to dispose of this tobacco to Governement, at
only 4 d. per pound; at which rate, it brought him only
L. 104.  It appeared, from the trials made at the time,
that tobacco would thrive well in the southern parts of Scot-
land.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent is L. 8733 Scots.
The real amounts to about L. 2500 sterling.  The rent of the
best land in the parish L. 1: 10 per English acre.  The
land, in general, is let, not by the acre, but in the lump.

   Number of Proprietors, Tenants, Etc.-There are two great
and one small proprietor, or feuer in the parish.  One of
these, Mr Hunter of Crailing, resides at his country seat dur-
ing the summer.  Mount-teviot-lodge, (a seat of the Marquis
of Lothian,) has not been occupied by the family for some
time past.  There are four farmers, who pay L. 100; other
four, upwards of L. 200, one L. 300 per annum; besides
