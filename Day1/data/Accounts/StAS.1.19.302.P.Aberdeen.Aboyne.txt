   Antiquities.-There is a hill in the parish of Aboyne,
called Mullach's hill, in which there are a great number of
cairns, said to be burial-places, after a great battle, in which
one Mullach was killed.

   Proprietors of the Estate of Aboyne.-This estate ancient-
ly belonged to Fraser the thane of Cowie.  The Earl of
Marischal married the heiress of that estate, and the Mar-
quis of Huntly her only daughter.  Marischal kept the
lands of Cowie, and Huntly got Aboyne, which he gave to
his second son.  That young nobleman was burned to death
in the house of Frendraught, where he and some of his
friends were on a visit.  Lady Frendraught was suspected
of having set fire to that part of the house in which he
lodged; but it is still doubtful whether his death was wil-
ful or accidental.  The estate and the title of the Earl of
Aboyne were given to another son of the family of Hunt-
ly.  But in a few generations, the Earls of Aboyne were
so much reduced in their circumstances, that the last Earl
sent his baggage to Paris, because he saw he could not live
in Scotland suitably to his rank.  Unwilling, however, to
abandon his country, he ordered it to be brought back, and
by attending to the management of his estate, and the sale
of his wood, and selecting able overseers for his personal
farm, he soon retrieved his affairs.  And after a life, not
remarkable for its length, but for its activity, intelligence,
and steadiness, he lest a clear estate of L. 6000 a-year to his
eldest son, and another, about the third part of that value,
to his second son.  In an age in which dissipation is so pre-
valent, a character of this kind ought to be mentioned with
respect; and in a Statistical Account, the following parti-
culars regarding Lord Aboyne's rural economy are worthy
of notice.-He built eighteen miles of a boundary to his
farm and plantations.  The whole stone sences, including
