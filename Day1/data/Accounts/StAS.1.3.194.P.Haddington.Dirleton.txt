     PARISH OF DIRLETON.

     (County of East Lothian.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER GLEN.

     Situation, Extent, Name, etc.

   THIS parish is situated in the presbytery of Haddington,
and synod of Lothian and Tweddale, where the Frith
of Forth opens into the German ocean.  It is about six En-
glish miles length, and as many in breadth.  The west
part along the Frith is barren land for  near three miles.  To
wards the east the soil is better, and consists of a large
plain,  near three miles in lenght, and one in  breadth, which
is covered with fine grass, and seems never to have been
ploughed.  There are two small islands belonging to the pa-
rish.  The  one called Fidrie is a very  beautiful island, on
which there are the ruins of a building, probably designed either
for a chapel, or a lazaret for the sick.  The village of Dirle-
ton is nearly in the middle of the parish, standing on a 
rocky ground, rising  towards the west.  The rocks found
and shake, as carriages pass along, which circumstances, pro-
bably gave rise to the name; the Scottish word Dirl signify-
ing trembling.

   Diseases.-Agues and nervous distempers are common
here, East-Lothian being much exposed to the easterly
winds, which blow in April and May.
