the two last are seldom required.  There are likewise two or
three private schools, one of which is supported by a num-
ber of the principal inhabitants of the town, who give the
master 36 l. per annum for teaching 36 scholars.

   Poor.-The funds for the support of the poor arise from
rents of land, mort-cloths, seats in the church, marriages,
legacies, and collections at the church-door.  There are di-
stributed yearly among them, about Martinmas, between 70 and
80 bolls of coals.  The weekly pensioners receive among them
16 s. per week; and about 16 l. or 17 l. are divided among the
poor at the sacrament; besides, they receive occasionally as
circumstances require.  The distribution, communibus annis, is
about 130 l. The number of poor is about 120.  There is
also a fund for the support of seven poor widows of shipma-
sters left by John Carmichael shipmaster, about 60 years ago,
in money, houses, and land.  This charity is not confined to
Arbroath, but extends to Montrose and Dundee.  Widows
of the names of Carmichael, Pearson, and Strachan, have a
preferable claim, and after them, widows whose husbands
have been of any of the preceding names.  None can be ad-
mitted upon this charity who do not live nine months in the
year in Arbroath, or whose yearly income amounts to a sum
equal to that which they can receive from the fund.-An im-
proper behaviour also excludes from the benefit of this cha-
rity.
   This fund is under the direction of the magistrates, mini-
ster, kirk-treasurer, and boxmaster to the fraternity of sea-
men in Arbroath; and by the care and attention of the ma-
nagers, it has increased considerably for some years past, so
that each of the widows instead of 5 l. or 6 l. which they
formerly received, now draw above 13 l. yearly.
