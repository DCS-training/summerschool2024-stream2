   Minerals.-The minerals come under the general denomi-
nation of coal metals, viz. sandstone, (or freestone,) clays of
great variety, having different names according to their co-
lour and degree of induration, a very great number of dis-
tinct seams of coal, and three beds of limestone.  These ex-
tend over the whole of the parish; nor has there as yet been
discovered within its bounds any granite or basaltes (here term-
ed whinstone,) in any solid mass, or even contained in any
stracture, (or dike as it is called) excepting in a small corner
on the east end of the ridge of Pentland Hills.-The rolling
stones, found occasionally in the channel of the river, are
brought down in floods from the hills, lying without the
bounds of the parish.
   On the north west side of the river North Esk, the metals
stand much on edge, forming in some places an angle of
above 65 degrees with the horizon; and in other places
(though not in this parish) standing perfectly perpendicular,
for which reason the coals in this district are distinguished
by the name of the edge coals.  They consist of different
seams, small and great, almost innumerable; but in the baro-
ny of Loanhead, about the middle of their course through
the parish, they amount to twenty-five in number, of work-
able seams from two to ten feet in thickness.  By a cross
level mine from the river, they are wrought from the grass
downwards to the depth of 90 yards perpendicular.-These
edge seams, from the sea side in the lands of Duddingston in
the line of their direction (or streak,) extend in a body to-
wards Linton in Tweeddale, about 12 or 13 miles, of which
the part in this parish is about four miles in length.
   On the south east side of the river the metals have so small
a dip or declination, that the coal there, of which seven or
eight seams have already; been discovered, has got the name
of the flat broad coals.  Their dip is about one in seven or
