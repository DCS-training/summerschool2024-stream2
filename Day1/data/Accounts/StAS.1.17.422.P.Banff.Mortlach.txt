     Statistical Account

an old acquaintance, whether an agreeable friend or a favor-
rite scene, it is natural to be fond.  Early or established pre-
possessions are with difficulty removed, and it is hard to be
put to the trial of eradicating in a distant land, the sweet re-
membrance of happier days.
   In the register of marriages, there is, through some negli-
gence or other, a chasm which prevents from going further
back, with any precision, than the last 20 years; viz. from
the 1st of January 1773 to the 31st of December 1792.  But
this shall be d ne, as under, in two equal periods.

Or 16 2/3 marriages annually.   Or 12 3/5 marriages annually.

   Each marriage, at a medium, may produce 4 or 5 children.
There is no register of deaths or burials kept.
   The number of men servants is 135, and of women servants
102 or thereabout; all for the purposes of husbandry or the
care of children.  This number may seem small.  But many
of the farmers have their sons and daughters to assist them;
and servants wages have risen to such a height, that they
must do with as few as possible.
