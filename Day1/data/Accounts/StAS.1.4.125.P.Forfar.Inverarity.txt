most approved method, is to mix it with earth and dung,
about 1 part marl, 1 earth, and 2 dung.  This compost, by
spreading it equally, prevents dangerous effects; and also
causes it to work sooner than when marl is laid on by it-
self.  What in some measure may have retarded the pro-
gress of agriculture here, is the old system of bondage and
cottagers, which fill prevails.  This practice has continued,
on account of very long leases having been formerly given.
Of cottagers, there are to the number of 60 families, and the
bondage in which they are held by the great farmer, has
evidently an effect in rendering the less industrious; not
having the command of their own time, they are brought
not to know its value, and from being idler when
paying bondage abroad, they learn to be lazy at home; be-
sides, as they hold their cottages from year to year, every
little improvement they should make, would render them
only more dependent on their master.  As the old leases
of the great farms expire, these cottages are getting leases
from the proprietor.  From this, and the abolishing of per-
sonal services, it is not doubted but their situation will be
improved, and the most powerful motive be given to excite
their industry.
   There are but few inclosures in this parish in proportion
to the extent of arable ground.  Corn therefore is princi-
pally ciltivated.  Where a field has been under cultivation
and inclosed, it may let from 18 s. to 21 s. the acre; where
it is otherwise, it will not give above 15 s.  The valued
rent is L. 2987: 6: 8 Scots; the real rent about L. 2000
Sterling.
   Labourers get a shilling a-day without their victuals;
farm servants have from L.8 to L. 10 the year, and maid-
servants from L. 3 to L. 4; and the wages of all of them are
still gradually rising, which shews that both manucfactures
and agriculture are in a thriving condition.
