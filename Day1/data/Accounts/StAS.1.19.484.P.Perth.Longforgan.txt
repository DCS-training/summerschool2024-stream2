   State of the Poor.-The state of the poor in Scotland is,
in every respect, quite different from what is in England.
There is a kind of very commendable pride, which pre-
vents many of the labouring poor in this country from ac-
cepting parish charity, as long as by their own industry, or
by the bounty of their friends, they can get a morsel of
bread.  In most parishes, the ordinary funds are sufficient
to supply the wants of their poor:  These are principally
under the management of the minister and the kirk-session,
who must be well acquainted with the circumstances of every
one; but should the ordinary funds prove insufficient, the
care of the poor falls to the heritors.  This has happened in
some parishes; and hence, something like a rate, or pro-
portional assessment, has taken place; but in this parish
there is no such thing.
