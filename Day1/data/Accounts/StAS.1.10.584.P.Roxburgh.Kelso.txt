   Town of KELSO.-Kelso, anciently, Calchow, Kelkow,
or de Calco, is situated on the river Tweed, in an extensive
plain, bounded on all sides by gently rising grounds, covered
with fine forest trees, forming a most beautiful amphitheatre.
Its situation is particularly taken notice of by Patten, who
accompanied the Lord Protector, Somerset, into Scotland,
and who calls it a pretty market town.
   During the border wars, which long spread desolation and
misery over this country, Kelso was thrice burnt down by
the English: It was also reduced to ashes, in the year 1686,
by an accidental fire; and nearly so by another, about 50
years ago.  At present, it is a handsome town, containing
many good houses, with a spacious market place 300 feet in
length, and 200 in breadth; from hence, as a centrical point,
proceed four long streets, and two considerable lanes.  In
the square stands the town house, the principal houses, and
shops, many of which would do no discredit to the capital
of any country.

   Name.-Kelso is probably derived from the word Calx.  This
conjecture seems the more probable, from an eminence on
Tweed side, on which put of the town stands.  This height
is called the Chalk-heugh, or Calchow, one of the ancient
names of the town, and contains a great quantity of Gyp-
sum, and other calcareous matters; all which, in the Celtic
language, were denominated Kelk, hence Kelkon; and the
Monks denominated the seal of the ancient monastery, Si-
gillum Monasterii de Calco.  This eminence also affords a
delightful prospect, which by some is thought to eclipse
that from the bridge.
