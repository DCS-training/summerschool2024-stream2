92                    SHETLAND

   Perhaps the greatest drawback to the improvement of Yell,
and it may be of Shetland generally, and which, more than any
thing else, operates as a drag on the resources of the landlord, is
the small portions into which the land is let off to accommodate
the present overgrown fishing population.  For as each tenant,
whether paying L. 1,5s or L.5, must have a house to live in,
built at an original cost of L. 15, and, upon an average, not last-
ing more than twenty-five years, the heritor who has an income
of L. 400 a-year, has at least an hundred houses on the property
from which he draws this rent.  Hence he is under the necessity
of building four new houses annually, at an original cost of L.60,
and is exposed to the daily annoyance and expense of keeping the
remaining ninety-six in a state of habitable repair, which the oc-
cupants, being tenants at will, never consider themselves obliged
to do.
   Until this system can be got rid of, which, it is likely, will be
attempted, when the divisions of the commons, now in progress,
are completed, there is but a slender prospect either of the tenant
bettering his circumstances, or of the landlord increasing the value
of his estate.
   That 33,000 acres of pasture, 1500 acres of arable, and 2500
acres of inclosed grass land, should only produce an average rent
of scarcely 8d. per acre, can only be attributed to the distance at
which they are situated from a market for their produce.  But it
is hoped that the now regularly established communication week-
ly, by steam, between Shetland and the coast of Scotland, will
tend to open up a ready market for the various kinds of stock, ex-
cite attention to the selecting and improving the native Shetland
breeds, whether of black-cattle, sheep, or horses, and in the end
greatly improve the circumstances both of landlord and tenant.
