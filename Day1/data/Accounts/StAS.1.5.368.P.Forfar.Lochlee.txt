   Character.-The inhabitants are, for the most part, re-
gular in their lives, none of them, since the commencement
of this century, having been subjected to any criminal prosecu-

frequent among them, and may be productive of other bad
practices.  The character of the people, however is, on the
whole, respectable; and if they want somewhat of that po-
lish, which prevails in more fertile and more populous di-
stricts, they are also free from many of those fashionable
vices, by which the others are distinguished.
