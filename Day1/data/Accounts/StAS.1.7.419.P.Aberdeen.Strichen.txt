     of Strichen.

ry inconsiderable part, belongs to Alexander Fraser, Esq.
There are several plantations of fir and forest trees in the
parish, made and planted by the late Lord Strichen, which,
from the beauty of contrast, make a great addition to the
appearance of the place, in a country where there is little
wood.  Among these plantations, there are a good many old
trees, (supposed to have been planted about the beginning of
the last century, 150 circles being counted on some of them,
which were cut down 35 years ago).  They drew a compli-
ment from the late Dr Johnston, who says, in his Tour
through Scotland, that "he had travelled 200 miles, and
"had only seen one tree not younger than himself, but at
"Strichen, he saw trees of full growth, worthy of his no-
"tice."-The animals and bird tribe, are the same that are
common in the rest of the country.  There have been, for
40 years past, great numbers of the regulus, or golden crest-
ed wren, goldfinches, thrushes, and lapwings, all of which
have been in the custom of building and hatching here.  Of
late the goldsinches have quite disappeared, and the lapwings
are much fewer.  Black-birds, ring ouzel, and dobchick,
which used to come only in winter, with great slocks of snow
birds, and fieldfares, remain now, and build their nests; the
snow-birds and fieldfares leave the country in May.  Of late
years, in the month of November, bulfinches, Carolina chat-
terers, and different kinds of woodpeckers, make their ap-
pearance, and continue through the winter.-The parish has
the advantage of an excellent lime quarry in the center of it,
and of great plenty of peat for firing.  There are 5 well fre-
quented yearly markets held in it.  The people are, in general,
sober and industrious, go neat and clean, and are of an ex-
tremely obliging benevolent disposition.-The stones on the
side of an high hill in this parish are of a whitish colour, and
of the nature of the white slint, of which porcelain is made.
