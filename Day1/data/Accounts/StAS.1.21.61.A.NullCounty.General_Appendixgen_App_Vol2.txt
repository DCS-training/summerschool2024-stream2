parish and has never been revived to this day; and conse-
quently our poor have been supported by the above specified
sum for these ten years, because we had no more to give

   The minister and his elders know the particular situation
of every individual poor person in the parish; and conse-
quently we are in no danger of being imposed upon by idle
claimants.  We make it indeed a part of our business to get
acquainted with the circumstances of poor people in the de-

them to business; and if they leave no young children be-
hind them, but have other poor relations advanced in life,
it is generally given to them according to their necessities,
I should have observed before, that, when they sign the
bond, we take an inventory of all their effects; and if any
thing be wanting at their death, the relations or friends who
have been going about them must account to us for it.  This
regulation I have always rigorously adhered to; and have
thereby prevented several idlers from becoming a burden
