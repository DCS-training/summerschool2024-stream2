   It may be proper to add, that, on the east side of the count-
try, each boat does not carry above 45 or 50 ground lines.
The fishery on that side is carried on at much less expence;
but is, in general, proportionally smaller than on the west side.
This year the fishery has been very unsuccessful; so that the
boats will not have 400 ling, instead of the 800, which is 
stated as an average.  The consequence must be, that the poor
fishermen, disappointed in this only source of gain, must this

   These fish are cured for exportation to Spain, Hamburgh,
and Ireland.  They fell, when dried, from 16 s. to 11 s. a cwt.
This year, in general, no higher price than 11 s. has been
given, besides the 3 s. allowed by government for every cwt.
exported.  The greatest part of the cod and tusk is sent to
Leith, and sold at between 16 s. and 19 s. a cwt.  The pro-
prietors of the lands, or receivers of the fish, make, on an
average, a profit of L. 10 Sterling from every fishing boat
belonging to their estates.  Every tenant is obliged to fit out
a certain share of a boat, in proportion to the extent and va-
lue of the land he possesses.

   The voes, by which the parish is intersected, furnish, in
most years, plenty of small fish, from the livers of which a
