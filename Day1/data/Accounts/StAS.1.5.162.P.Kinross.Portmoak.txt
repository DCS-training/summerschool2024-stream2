more remarkable for their breed of black cattle than horses.
This parish usually maintains 1290 black cattle.  These
are very different in size and value, according to the nature
of the farms on which they are reared.  Stots of 3 or 4
years old, sell, at an average, for L. 8, and cows for L. 6
But on several farms they are much more valuable; some
of them, when fir for the butcher, weighing 50 or 60 stone.

much diminished.  The number at present in the parish is

They are very hardy, but of a small size, being sold for a-

sells at 15 s.  By a little attention, the value both of the
carcase and the steece might be improved.
