     of Cramond.

may be moderately estimated at L. 13; a great increase when
compared with their wages in 1760, which were no more
than L 8, including every article; and even so late as 1775,
L. 9 was reckoned high emolument.  Maid servants of far-
mers get L. 3 per annum, and are maintained in the house.
Barnmen and other able-bodied labourers are paid at the
rate of 5 s. and 6 s. per week, when constantly employed;
when only occasionally, 1 s. 2 d per day.  A mason's wages
is 1 s. 8 d. a day, and a hay cutter's 1 s. 6 d. to 1 s. 8 d. per
day.  Reapers get from 6 d. to 1 s. a day, and maintenance
during harvest.  Women working in the fields earn in ge-
neral 6d a day, and are much better employed than former-
ly, there now being a great deal of hoeing, weeding, and
picking performed by them, insomuch that they usually have
at least one half of the year outwork.  When not thus em-
ployed, they betake themselves to spinning, at which they
seldom make more than 3 d, a day.

   Work by the piece is now coming into use, in which corn
is cut at 5 s per acre on an average, and threshed at 6 d. per
boll.  Hay is cut from 1 s. 6 d. to 3 s. per acre, according to
the weight of the crop, and made in some cases at 2 s. per
acre.  Stone and lime dikes built at 12 s. per rood, materials
being furnished by the employer; houses, barns, and stables
at 25 s. ditto.

   The following table exhibits a comparative state of the
prices of labour in 1760, 1775, and 1790.
