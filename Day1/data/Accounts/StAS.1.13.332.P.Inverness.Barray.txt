   Population-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls in 1755 was 1150.  There has been no
exact list taken of the number of inhibitants here since it
was erected into a parish; at least I could find none.  But 
it is evident that population must have increased consider-

that then there were some lands unoccupied, and many of 
the tenants possessed a whole penny; whereas, lately, the 
proprietor was obliged to divide the lands into smaller 
portions, in order to accomodate the inhabitants.  At this 
time, no tenant occupies more that 1/2 penny, and many

number of souls in this parish is 760 males, and 864 fe-
males, in all 1604, of which only 80 are Protestants.  Be- 
sides this number, upwards of 200 left this country within 
the last 2 years; some emigrated to the island of St John's,
and Nova Scotia, in North America, being inveigled thither
by a Mr F*** upon promises of the undisturbed prosession 
of their religion, (being all Roman catholics), and of free 
property for themselves, and their offspring for ever; but
how soon they were landed, he left them to their shifts,
and returned back to his native country*.

Scotland till the reign of James VI. when an English

*These poor people were left in the most deplorable situation. If
the inhabitants of the different places in which they landed, had not ex-
erted themselves for their relief, many of them must have perished, for
want of the common necessaries of life.  They became sensible of their
folly when it was too late; others went to glasgow, being invited thi-
ther by Mr David Dale, to work in his cotton manufactory; but Mr
Dale's terms not coming up to their expectations, some of the returned
home; and many of them, from a change of diet and occupation con-
