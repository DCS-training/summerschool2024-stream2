at Linton, and purchase sheep of a year old.  These, according
to the custom of the sheep-farmers in the south, have been
smeared with tar, but that practice is not found necessary in
this district.  After they have been shorn three times white,
as they express it, they are sold about August and September,
as fit for the butcher's use.
   The next thing that is worthy of notice in this parish, is the
state of the woollen manufactures.  These have been carried
on in the village of Alva, for more than a century at least.
They consist chiefly of Scots blankets and serges.  The former
are made from 9d to 1 s. the Scots yard, and the latter from
10 d. to 15 d. and a few from 16 d. to 18 d. per yard.  It is
more than probable, that this species of manufacture had
flourished a great many years ago, in the neighbouring village
of Tillicoultry; as an evidence of this, it is at this day,
known among the shopkeepers of the Lawnmarket of Edin-
burgh, by the name of Tillicoultry serges.  The number of
looms constantly employed at present in this village is 67.
The length of each web may be reckoned at 80 yards, and.
taking the average value at 10 d. or 11 d. per yard, the gross
produce will amount to from L. 7000 to L. 8000 ster. annu-
ally.  The manufacturers make use chiefly of English wool in
their serges and blankets, and this partly short, and partly
combed wool.  That which is produced from the sheep that
pasture on the Ochills, is commonly manufactured by the
people of the country for their own private use.  A very con-
siderable sum is annually expended by the weavers in this
place, in purchasing wool, which it is impossible to ascertain
with any degree of precision.  These serges are sold not only
in Edinburgh, but likewise in Stirling, Glasgow, Greenock,
Perth, and Dundee.  The finest kinds of serges are some-
times dressed and dyed by the traders in Stirling, and sold as
