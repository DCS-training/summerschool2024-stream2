are engaged with the Dalruaidhins, and worsted.  In 749,
they are engaged with the Britons, and Talorgan their leader
killed.  In 788, a most dreadful slaughter of them is made
by the Norwegians.  When reduced to this low ebb, instead
of conquering, they afforded a favourable opportunity for be-
ing conquered.  Accordingly Kenneth, at this very juncture,
rushed down from his hills, with his hardy mountaineers, and
seized their possessions on the eastern coast, which seem to
have been so greatly depopulated, by the repeated calamities
already mentioned, that from this period the Picts ceased to
be a people, and their very language sunk into oblivion.  All
our chronicles agree in this conquest of Kenneth, who in 843
translated his throne from Dalruadhain (or Campbelton) to
Fortren, or Forteviot, whither, in the local history of the pa-
rish of Campbelton, it is not necessary to follow him.
   After Kenneth had thus removed the seat of his govern-
ment, from the western to the eastern coast of Scotland, this
remote and deserted corner soon became a prey to foreign in-
vaders.  The Danes and Norwegians, who, since the year
795 made frequent descents on the western isles, had now
got firm possession of the greater part of them.  Nor were
they satisfied with this, but in a short time made such fre-
quent inroads into the heart of the kingdom, as to put it en-
tirely out of the sovereign's power, to pay any attention to the
frontiers.  Kintyre being a peninsula, suffered the same fate
with the islands: Both were the asylum of pirates, who not
only infested these and the adjacent parts, but frequently re-
turned to commit depredations on the kingdoms from which
they came.  At length HAROLD HARFAGER, King of Den-
mark, about the end of the ninth century, found it necessary to
make an expedition to this country in person, for the purpose
of reducing them to obedience, and appointing a viceroy or
