visitor to occupy a station in the very centre of the tremendous ob-
jects by which he is surrounded. As there is no path, the tourist
will at once perceive the necessity ofusing much caut ' ion in descend-
ing to this spot. On looking around him, he finds the range of his
vision fearfully limited, by objects vast and immense, concentrated
in fearful magnificence before him, and in almost alarming proximity
to him. He is apt, however, to consider his situation more danger-
ous than it really is. From the tree, the scene is extremely grand.
The water appears to issue from an oblong fissure in the rock, from
whence, with a fearful rush, it dashes its way, chieffy in one great
column, to the pool below, from which at this station no outlet can be
perceived. The immediate neighbourhood of the fall is amazingly
wild and barren. In this respect, it differs essentially from its neigh-
bouratFoyers. Hereandtberemaybeseenatuftofgrass,orper-

sheets of perpendicular rocks, and adding, if possible, to the gene-
ral grandeur of the scene.
  Geology- The prevailing rock in this parish is gneiss, contain-
ing occasionally intersecting veins, also beds, and -bodies of granite -
and syenite.
  Botany.-Kintail affords ample study to the botanist. The ordi-
nary plants grow profusely, and flower richly,-although it must be
admitted, that the humidity of the climate obviously affects the per-
fection and beauty of many. of them. ' From this circumstance, it is
most difficult to preserve plants in this country; and although every
precaution was used to prepare a Hortus Siccus, according to the
method recommended by Sir J. E. Smith, of such plants as are in-
digenous to the district,-yet, after the lapse.of two years, they be-
came quite useless and unfit for subsequent examination. No rare
plant seems to be produced in this country; and it would occu-
py more space than can be well afforded, to give a minute classifica-
tion of such as are indigenous to the parish. The following may
be mentioned; but the list is by no means complete.
