   In this parish there are also some ruins of Danish or Pictish
houses, as they are usually called.  These are about 10 feet
square, with a door and hearthstone evidently marked with fire;
and which, though insignificant in themselves, serve to show that
the inhabitants of this part of Aberdeenshire were at one time of
Scandinavian origin.

                       III.-POPULATION.
   According to the census of 1791, the population amounted to
2215; of 1811, to 2271; and of 1831, to 2954: and by a census
lately taken at the request of the General Assembly's Committee
for Church Extension, it was found to be 3080; of whom there
are 700 under twelve years of age.  It appears that the princi-
pal increase was from 1811 to 1831, which is to be ascribed chief-
ly to the herring-fishery, which began to be prosecuted upon an ex-
tensive scale in 1815.  The fishermen also marry at an early pe-
riod of life.  The number of marriages is, at an average, about
36, and of births, 60.  But no register of the number of deaths
has been hitherto kept, though the people have been called upon
to avail themselves of it.  There is reason to believe, however,
that these do not exceed 50.  During the herring-fishery, which
commences in July, and closes in September, there is an increase
of the population of no less than 1200, so that, owing to the activi-
ty and bustle which then prevail, the town and the harbour have a
very bustling appearance.  And the herring-fishery having brought
to the inhabitants an increase of wealth, it has produced amongst
them a change both as to dress and diet, in which respect there
is here little or no difference from what is met with in much larger
communities.

   There are here three landed proprietors, and the
value rent L.300O Scotch. None of the proprietors are resident
but Lord Saltoun, and he only for a few weeks in the year.  He is
not only patron, but the largest proprietor of the parish, his pro-
portion of the valued rent being L. 2266, 13s. 4d.  The real rent
has fallen about six per cent. since the year 1815; and, had it not
been for those improvements which have been made in agricul-
ture by the tenantry, the diminution would have been still great-
er.  All the land is arable,with the exception of about 80 acres
of moss. The farms are in extent from 50 to 300 acres, and are
let for 1Os. to L.3 Sterling per acre.  Though not put up to pub-
