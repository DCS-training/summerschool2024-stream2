pursue such rapacious, oppressive, and bloody measures, as
must shock any feeling heart.
   Amongst our self-conceited politicians, another topic of
declamation is, "the folly of involving us in a war so ex-
"pensive and unnecessary, and sending troops to assist the
"Dutch, when they did not want our assistance."  That
there are Jacobins and malecontents in Holland, as well as
in Britain, needs not to be doubted; one would even be

called to do it by a principle of common honesty.  Besides,
to defend the Dutch was, in effect, to defend ourselves, ac-
cording to that well known maxim of antiquity,

   When a neighbour's house or his field is on fire, one

do all in his power to prevent it.  This is suggested to us
by the general principle of self-preservation.  It is the dic-
tate of common policy and of common sense.  The Dutch
