The church of Inverbrothock was built in 1828, and opened in
October 1829. It cost about L.2000, and is seated for 1230 sit-
ters. The principal heritors and the town council of Arbroath
were the principal subscribers to it. Ther stipend secured to its
minister is L.150, with L.20 for communion elements. Ther mi-
nister of this church and his session have the superintendence of
the poor within their district. The proprietor of each pew has a
vote in the election of a minister, but the leet proposed to them
is selected by the five managers.
	The church of Ladyloan is in Arbroath parish, but there are
842 persos of the district allocated to the church within the pa-
parish of St Vigeans.
	Within the parish there are only two Dissenting meeting-
houses; one belonging to the Original Constitutional Seceders,
and another to the Methodists. Thd village of Auchmithie and
neighbourhood employ a preacher of the Established Church in
a small chapel there. Ther late Countess of Northesk being de-
sirous of more effectual means of spiritual improvement, and of
the accommodation of the villagers, built this chapel in 1829.
On account, however, of some hesitation of connecting it wholly
with the Established Church, it was not opened till 1834.  At
that time, worship continued in it regularly on the Lord's day for
nine months, when it was again shut, and only opened for the pa-
rish minister at such times as he could officiate. This continued
till December 1840, when the villagers obtained a preacher to of-
ficiate in their schoolroom, who, after some time, was admitted to
the chapel, with the understanding that the privilege should only
be from week to week during the pleasure of the proprietor.

<FOOTNOTE>coferred; and St Vigeans being the parish in which the Abbey was built. The
church of St Vigeans would appear from its style to have been built long before. The
gift of the teinds, however, displessed the bishop's successor Hoger, and a settlement
was mad by arbitration with the abbot, when the teinds were confirned to the ab-
bey in the years of the birth of Alexander, William's son. In the fifteenth century,
the whole lands of the parish belonged to the abbey, excepting Inverpeffer.
