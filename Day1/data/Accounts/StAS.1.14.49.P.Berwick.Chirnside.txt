Hall, Esq. of Whitehall, is patron of the parish.-The
salary of the schoolmaster is 100 merks Scots, or, which
is near the same, 1 month's cess of the parish.  His
house is presently in good repair, and of such length, as
affords a large room for the school.  To his salary, are
added, the emoluments of session-clerk and precentor,
and that of an allowance for being collector and distri-

roll.-These are levied, not at fixed meetings of the he-

tioned, to make a farther provision for the poor.  At
their meeting, the account of the expenditure is present-
ed by the collector; and then the state of the roll being
considered, and what alterations have ensued, or may
be, from observed circumstances, made in it; such an
assessment is appointed, as corresponds to the supply re-
quired, until another meeting of the heritors be called.
The one half of the collections made in the church is
regularly taken up by the collector, and go in aid of
the assessments.  The other remains with the session,
to be distributed in cases of casual distress, to indigent
people not admitted upon the poor's roll.

from the accidental locality of his birth.  His monu-
ment, erected upon the Calton-hill, at Edinburgh, where
he died, is only inscribed with his name, and the year
of his death.  It is enough; for (as this simple signa-
