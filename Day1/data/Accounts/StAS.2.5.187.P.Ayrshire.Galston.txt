ment is founded upon many careful observations and inquiries in
different parts of the parish, and though it be only the result of a
combination of partial averages, will be found to be pretty near
the truth. It certainly does not, upon the whole, exceed the truth,

			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY. 
	Market-Town--Means of Communication.--There is no market-
town in this parish, the nearest being Kilmarnock, which is five 
miles distant from the village of Galston. With this town as well
as Glasoow, and indeed all parts of the kingdom, the communica-
tion is easy by means of excellent turnpike-roads, of which about
ten miles fall within the parochial boundaries. The parish roads
amount to upwards of twenty miles, and are generally kept in very
good order. There are two carriers who go to and return from
Glasgow, each twice in a week, and one carrier to Kilmarnock,
who goes every lawful day. There is also a daily communication
with Ayr, Edinburgh, and all the intervening places, by means of
a stage-coach, which passes through the village, and a coach from 
73 
Glasgow to London by Dumfries passes through another part of
the parish. There is a penny-post in the village, and a daily de-
livery of letters.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church is situated in the village
of Galston; and as there is here a population of nearly 1900 imme-
diately contiguous to the church, its situation with regard to the
general mass of the parishioners cannot be said to be inconvenient.
At the same time there are several houses in the eastern part Of
the parish which are about eight miles distant from the village, and
the regularity with which some of their inhabitants attend the parish
church, in spite of its distance, must be acknowledged to be high-
ly creditable to their religious character, as well as indicative of
their attachment to the national establishment. The present
church was built in 1808, on a neat and substantial plan, and is
ornamented with a spire and clock.  It affords sitting for 1020;
of which number, however, there are not more than 250 appro-
priated to the villagers, the rest being divided amongst the heri-
