found at Aberlemno. That at the chapel of Auldbar is singular,
as, instead of horsemen and spears, there are two persons sitting,
probably religious, and beneath them, a man seemingly tearing out
a lion's tongue-perhaps Samson, and opposite to him a curious
figure of an antique harp, and under these a man on horseback, a
lamb, and other animals." It is most probable that this was either
an altar piece, or that it was intended in some way to ornament
the sacred edifice whence it was taken. The subject is evident-
ly a scriptural one, although, from the introduction of the harp, it
is most probable that it was David and not Samson, whom the
sculptor designed to represent as achieving a victory over some
beast of prey.
   In the south-west of the parish, and on the very summit of Tu-
rin hill, are the remains of an ancient fort, called at the present
day Camp Castle. The space occupied by it is considerable, and
has been fortified with a double rampart. The interior enclosure
is chrcular, through the very centre of which there passes a mo-
dern dike, dividing the camp into equal portions, between the pa-
rishes of Aberlemno, and Rescobie. The view from this fort is
very extensive, and must have been admirably fitted for a watch-
tower, overlooking the valley of the Lunan water on the one hand,
and the pass from Forfar to Brechin on the other. It has been
constructed with dry stones, and bears the character, seemingly
of a castra aestiva (summer camp,) of the Romans; while another
fortification, two miles farther north, just beyond the confines of this
parish, and overlooking the valley of the Esk, has more of the
character of a castra stativa (or permanent camp), the  stones hav-
ing been fused and cemented by the action of fire.

                        <TABLE=III.-Population>
      In 1755 the population was                943
         1790 it had increased to              1033
         1801, it was again reduced to          945 viz. males, 471, females, 474
         1831,                                 1079
         1842                                  1023

   The chief, and almost the only cause of this fluctuation, is the
increase or diminution in demand for workmen in the slate and
pavement quarries.
