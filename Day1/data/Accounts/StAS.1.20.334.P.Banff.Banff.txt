Chair in the University of Glasgow.  He was succeeded by
Mr Andrew Skene, minister of Keith, who died at Bath, in
December 1792.
   The present incumbent, Mr Abercromby Gordon was
admitted in August 1793.
   The parish church was built in the years 1789 and 1790,
after the model of the new church at Dundee; of which
Mr Pennant says, "It is built in a stile that does credit to
"the place, and shews and enlargement of mind in the Pres-
"byterians, who now begin to think that the Lord may be 
"praised in beauty of holiness."
   The body of the church measures 80 feet in length, and
50 of breadth, within the walls.  It is of proportionable
height.  Four Ionic columns support the galleries, which
form five sides of an octagon, and are high and spacious.
The church is elegantly finished within, and, exclusive of
roomy passages, will contain 1500 persons.  The pulpit is 
perhaps raised to and incommodious height, being an ascent
of 21 steps.  Some of my brethren, accustomed to a more
humble rostrum, decline officiating in so elevated a situa-
tion, and are ready to exclaim with the poet,

      How fearful
     And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
      I'll look no more,
     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient fight
     Topple down headlong.

The roof is a curious and massy structure.  It has ten prin-
cipal couples, whose beams extend the whole width of the
house, and support the ceiling.  The couples are strongly
bound with iron, having 700 pounds weight on each.
   The spire still remains in an unfinished state, which gives
the whole building a heavy and awkward appearance.  It 
is intended, however, to resume the work next season.
