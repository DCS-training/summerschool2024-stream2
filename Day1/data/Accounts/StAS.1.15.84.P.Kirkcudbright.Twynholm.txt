   barley, rye grass, rib'd grass, and the different clovers, cut
for hay one year, and pastured 8, then again broken up for
corn.  Wheat seldom turns out a profitable crops owing to
the wetness of our climate, and other causes.
Experiments tried with our rotten-stone quarries, where
the three first kind of manures are not to be obtained, might
have a happy effect.  In many places remote from these arti-
ficial manures, moss and turf are plenty.  Kilns made of sods
or turf might be erected, and the half dried peats burnt to
ashes, at no great expence, which are well known to be an
excellent manure for turnips, grass and grain.  There are dif-
ferent opinions, with respect to the quantity, to be laid upon
an acre, of the manures of the first three classes mentioned;
some thinking a smaller quantity, frequently repeated, best; o-
thers, a large quantity laid on at once, and not repeated for
some considerable length of time.  This depends in a good
measure upon the soil, and upon the manner of cropping the
land.  When the ground is treated, as above mentioned, and
is kept so long in pasture, the large quantities are, perhaps,
best, as having the most effect upon the grass; and as it is by
fermentation these manures operate, such a quantity, as will
fully promote this, will be found necessary, while a smal-
ler quantity will only produce a partial fermentation; as
beer, not having a sufficient quantity of yest, is always mud-
dy, sluggish and never clears.
