There is another slate and pavement quarry upon the property of
	John Ouchteriony, Esq. of Guynd, which has not been
	worked for many years.

	Manufactures.--There are no spinning-mills in the parish
considerable number of the population are employed in the weav-
ing of coarse linens, on account of inerrant and mill-spinners in
Arbroath and Dundee, from whom the yarns are obtained by car-
riers weekly. Many families are supported, chiefly by this branch
of manufacture. As the pavement quarries are not worked in win-
ter, a few slates only being there raised when the weather permits,
several of the quarriers having been bred to the loom, resume that
employment, during that season.
	Since the year 1820 the spinning of flax by machinery has ra-
pidly increased in the neighbouring towns, and many of the young
women have, in consequence, betaken themselves to weaving.
This new employment for young women cannot be so conducive
to health, as the ordinary labours of female servants; and in the
event of their becoming wive's, forms no good training for their
management of household affairs. From the increased numbers of
hands employed in weaving, one very beneficial effect results, in the
employment thus afforded, to various old womens in filling pirns--
the only work now left for them, since the improvements in machi-
nery have rendered the gains at hard spinning, so very trifling.
