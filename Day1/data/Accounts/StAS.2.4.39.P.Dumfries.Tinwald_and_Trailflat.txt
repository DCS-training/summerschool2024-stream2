		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Boundaries.--IN the Account formerly given of this
parish, the name Tinwald is supposed to be derived from the
Gaelic, and to signify the harbour; or from the Saxon, and to
signify the house in the wood. Whatever may be the import
of the  latter syllable of the word, which in the old presbytery
records is spelt weld, the former, viz. Tin or Ting, appears
more probably to have been derived from the Ting, or court of
the ancient Saxons or Scandinavians, who at one time posses-
sed a considerable portion of the country. Tings or courts are
well known to have been held in the open air; and immediately
adjoining the church here, there is a mound (which a few years
ago was perfectly entire, but is now much defaced " Seges est ubi
Troja fuit") evidently artificial, and said to bear a striking resem-
blance to one bearing the same name in the Isle of Man, upon which
local courts were held, until a very recent period. Tingwall in
Shetland appears to have derived its name from the same circum-
stance.--(See Peveril of the Peak, Vol. i. ch. v. Note 2d.) Trail-
flat is probably from a Gaelic etymon, which signifies a sloping wet
side. It was united to Tinwald in 1650.
	The united parish forms an irregular figure of about 6 miles
by 4 in its extreme length and breadth, and contains about 15
square miles. It is bounded by the parish of Kirkmichael upon
the north; by that of Lochmaben upon the east; by those of
Torthorwald and Dumfries upon the south and south-west; and
by that of Kirkmahoe upon the west and north-west.
