III.-POPULATION.

population of the two parishes at          1098

Fetlar,     ism,      859
North Yell, 188%        960
The probable causes of this                increase are, Ist, no drains from
the parish since the peace ; 2d, no epidemical -diseases; 3d, early
marriages; 4th, the introduction of vaccination.
All our population resides in the country.  We have no towns

The people are not remarkable for any personal                             qualities.
There are, in the two parishes, two insane persons, two silly, three
blind, one deaf and dumb.
The people are social enough among themselves,-s;yrnpathize
with one another,-are apt to murmur at their high rents,-are not
intemperate, since smuggling has been almost entirely put down;
but, withiii,these few years, they'have fallen into an abominable
habit of smoking tobacco.
