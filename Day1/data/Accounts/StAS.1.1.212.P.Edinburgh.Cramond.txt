     Statistical Account

of the parish becomes more variegated than the eastern side,
being diversified with rising grounds in several places.  But
the principal ornament of the west part is the river Amon,
whose banks, from above Craigiehall to Nether Cramond,
are high and steep, almost wholly covered with wood, and
frequently chequered with bold and overhanging rocks.  The 
land rises in general to some heighth, even close to the
sea shore; there are, however, in three or four places
along the shore, sandy plains or links.  The length of the
parish may be about 6 miles; and the breadth scarcely ever
exceeds 2; though the shape is rather irregular, assuming at
the west end a kind of surcated figure.  If contains in all
about 3890 Scottish acres, including the two small islands of
Cramond and Inchmickery.

   Name.-The parish is denominated from the principal vil-
lage, where the church stands, called Cramond, situated at
the mouth of the Amon.  Cramond appears evidently to be
a contraction of Caeramon, derived from Amon, a Celtic word,
signifying a river in general, and Caer, which, in the same
language, signifies a fort, viz. the Fort on the Amon.

   Manufactures.-The iron manufacture carried on by Messrs
Cadells and Edington, who now employ a capital of above
L. 30,000, consists of 3 forges, 2 slitting mills, and 2 steel
furnaces, at which bar iron is manufactured into blistered,
square or faggot, and German steel, hoops and rolled iron,
rod iron, boiler and pan plates for fire-engines, sockmoulds,
anchor palms, bolts for ship building, and other articles.
Above 30 men and boys are employed immediately at the
works, some of whom earn 26 s.  per week, and none make
less than 4 s.  There are also here spade and nail manufac-
tures belonging to the fame company, in which above 450.
