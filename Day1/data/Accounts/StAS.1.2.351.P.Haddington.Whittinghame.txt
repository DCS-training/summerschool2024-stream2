ses have been pulled down; and, it is probable, that several
others will soon share the same fate.-There is a public
house in this village, which is the only one in the whole pa-
rish.  It has had no bad effect on the morals of the people.
There are, indeed, very few, if any, addicted to the vice of
drunkenness.  The people are all virtuous, and distinguished
for an unremitting attention to their own business.  This
may be partly owing to their being so widely dispersed, and
being occupied principally with the wholesome and innocent
labours of the fields, and having seldom an opportunity of as-
sociating in crouds, or corrupting one another.  As their mo-

regularly attend public worship.  It may be subjoined, that
there are few Seceders, or sectaries in the parish.

   Climate.-Both the higher and lower parts of the parish are
remarkably healthful.  Lamer-moor is reckoned one of the
best and most falubrious climates in Scotland.  This may be

and partly, to the salutary exercise, which the inhabitants are
constantly under the necessity of taking, in traversing the hills
with their flocks.  Besides, the wind, confined by the open-
ings of the hills, rushes forward with increased velocity, and
sweeps before it every noxious and pestilential vapour.
-The lower part of the parish is likewise deemed extrem-
ly healthful.  It is a dry and open part of the country, infec-
ted with no damps or marshy grounds:  It stands on an eleva-
tion, of about 300 or 400 feet above the level of the sea; and
the extremity of it, on the east, reaches within 4 or 6 miles of
the German ocean.  The vapours, which are exhaled from the
sea, and formed into clouds, generally pass over the level
