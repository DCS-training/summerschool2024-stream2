   Many have arrived at advanced periods of life.  There are
several persons here between 80 and 90, and some of them
going about their ordinary business.  There is a man living
here, but mostly confined to his bed, whose age, from au-
thentic accounts, is 94: He was by trade a gardeners, and
has had five wives.  The annual average of births from the
parish records is about 50, and of marriages 15.  There is
no register of deaths kept here.  The number of births and
marriages cannot be exactly ascertained, as there are many
dissenters from the established church, who do not insert
their names in the parish register.  The population has
greatly increased within these few years, owing to the flou-
rishing state of the coal trade brought from Halbeath and,
shipped here, to a considerable distillery and brewery in the
neighbourhood of the town, and a branch of the iron foun-
dery business lately introduced.
