now but inconsiderable vestiges remaining of these vene-
rable antiquities.  A little to the northward of the castle,
are the remains of a Popish place of worship, commonly 
known by the name of the Old Kirk, or St Mungo's Cha-
pel.  This was formerly the parish-church; and the
church-yard was the burying ground of the parish:  Many
of the inhabitants still retain burying places in it.  There
are some traces of encampments on the S. E. of the village
of Auchterarder, at the foot of the Ochils.  Perhaps they
were out posts of the Roman camp at Ardoch; what-
ever they were, it seems probable the Romans were in this
neighbourhood; for in digging the foundation of the church
lately built in this place, a coin was found, of the Emperor

ago, there was found in a marl-pit, in the parish, a pair of
large horns, supposed to be of the Elk, or Eurus, which
were sent to Edinburgh, and are now in the custody of the 
Antiquarian Society.

much disposed to industry.  They are economical, and yet,
in general, by no means disinclined to humane and chari-
table actions.  Their condition would be benefited, could the
price of fuel the rendered cheaper.  Perhaps there are no means
of doing this, but by making the communication easier to
the coal which is the fuel they must now chiefly trust to.
In consequence of the act of Parliament, lately obtained
for erecting tolls upon the roads within the county of Perth,
it is proposed to make a toll road to Blairingone.  If this pro-
posal should be carried into execution, it will no doubt ren-
der the communication easier; and it is to be hoped, also
make the necessary article of coal cheaper.  Coal is brought
from Blairingone and Dollar, about 12 miles distance, and 
is sold here at 1 1/4 d. a stone, Tron weight; at the coal-hill 12
