    now carrying heavy crops of wheat, &c.  A still greater extent has
    been reclaimed on the Golspie side of the estuary.
       The contents of the principal farms on the Sutherland estate
    may be stated as follows:-Sidera, 196 acres; Evlix, 154; Farms,
    (1820, 1821, 1822,)344; Achley, 91; Pitgrudie, 133; Auchurach
    and Auchinchaunter, 84; Coull; 203; Skelbo, 323; East Balvraid,
    192 ; West Balvraid, 54; Cambusmore, 104; Torboll, 145;
    Pronsienain, 89; Pronsienaird, 132; Kinauld, 100; Trentham,,
    150,-all imperial acres.  The parks are, at an average, from 10
    to 15 acres each.  The average rent of old arable land is LA, 5s.
    per acre ;-that of improved waste land, 5s.
       Besides the principal farms which have been stated above, there
    are a great many lots, or small holdings, ranking from two to five
    or six acres, which are receiving yearly accessions from waste
    land by the industry of the occupiers; and though the average
    rent of improved waste land be stated at 5s. per acre, it is a well-
    known fact, that many of these cottars pay only a rent of Is. each,
    some 2s., and so on, in a gradual scale,-an increase of rent not
    being so much the object of the noble proprietors, as the improve-
    ment of the soil, and the comfort of their numerous tenantry; in
    which liberal objects they have succeeded.
       On the estate of Skibo there are 800 acres of arable land : and
    besides a great number of smaller holdings, there are four large
    farms, highly improved, and rented each at about L. 150.  On
    this estate also, a good deal has been done in reclaiming waste
    land; but much more in the parish of Criech, where the greater
    part of Mr Dempster's estate lies, and in which he has very ex-
    tensive plantations of firs and hard-wood.
       On the estate of the Duch‚ss Count\E3s of Sutherland in this
    -parish, there are plantations to the extent of 2500 acres, consisting
    of Scotch firs and larches, birch, and hard-wood.  To these,it is
    in contemplation to make -considerable additions.  There are be-
    sides 300 acres of natural birch and alder.
       On Mr Dempster's estate there are, plantations to the extent
    of 8,50 acres, a considerable part of which is hard-wood.  There
    -are some ashes and planes of great size.  The rest consists of
    Scotch firs and larches.  On the estate of Embo there may-be
    from 30 to 40 acres of Scotch fir, but, though old, very atinted in
    growth.
       On the estate of Embo, there is only one large farm, consist-
    ing of about 200 acres of arable land, of which from 30 to 40
