ny to the use of them; nor are they, as yet, among the
lower class, wholly fallen into disuse.  With them the belief

commonly credited; and though the faith in witchcraft be
much onteebled, the virtue of abstracting the substance from
one milk, and adding it to another, is rarely questioned.  The
ghost of the dying, called tasks, are said to be heard, their cry
being a repetition of the moans of the sick.  Some assume
the sagacity of distinguishing the voice of their departed
friends.  The corps follow the tract led by the tasks to the
