     Statistical Account

   The staple animal dept by the farmers is the sheep, ex-
cepting a very few farms where the hills are green, and where
lambs are fed for the butcher.  The sheep for sale are hogs,
i.e. sheep of one year old, sold off in June or July before they
are shorn.  They are disposed of to the Highlands, or Oichil
Hills in Fifeshire, at the Linton markets.  The principal of 
these markets are two; the one held invariably on the third
Wednesday of June old stile, the other that day week.  Between
twenty and thirty thousand sheep are generally sold at these
markets annually, many being brought from other parishes.
Some of the Tweeddale sheep are sold at Stagshaw, on the
English side, and bought in by farmers to the Yourshire sells,
whence, when older, they are sold to grazing farms farther
south.  The Highlanders keep what they buy for two or
three years, then sell them fat to Perth, Glasgow, and Edin-
burgh, about Martinmas; a considerable number, too, are
sent up to England.  Till of late, the great demand to the
Highlands was for wedder hogs, lately, the demand was
greatest for ewe hogs for breeding.  The average price for
these year old sheep at Linton markets, of late years, has been
9 s. a head.  The superannuated breeding ewes are either sold
fat at Martinmas to the butcher, at about 9 s. a head, or else
sold with lamb, in the month of March, to the Lothian parks
at 11 s.

   The duration of a breeding ewe varies, in different farms;
from 4 to 7 years.  The farmer, when smearing then at Mar-
tinmas, examines their teeth and their eyes, and from thence
judges whether he ought to keep them on his farm another
year.  When a farmer quits his farm, the new incomer knos
that it is highly dangerous to bring in a breeding stock which
has not been bred on the farm, and generally takes the breed-
ing stock on the farm at from 14 s. to 16 s. a head.  Rams
