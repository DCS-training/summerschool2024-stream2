   It is much to be regretted, that it was found im-
practicable, to include a greater number of parishes,
in this volume.  It contains, however, so many im-
portant districts, that the accounts could not, with
any degree of propriety, be rendered more concise.
There is reason, however, to believe, that, in future,
every volume will contain from 80 to 100 parishes;
so that, the whole work will be contained in about
ten volumes.  It now can hardly be doubted, that it
will prove the completest survey of a kingdom, of
which we have any knowledge; and, at the same
time, will not exceed, either in price, or bulk, the
topographical accounts given of many individual
counties in England.

   Nothing, therefore, is wanting, but a little far-
ther perseverance and exertion, on the part of the
clergy of Scotland, to complete a work,-which
will be a monument of their own industry and abi-
lities;-which will promote the improvement of
their country, more rapidly than can be effected by
any other means;-AND WHICH, BY GIVING MORE
AUTHENTIC INFORMATION, REGARDING THE IN-
TERNAL STRUCTURE OF POLITICAL SOCIETY, THAN
EVER WAS KNOWN BEFORE, MAY VERY MATERIALLY
CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF THE
SPECIES.
