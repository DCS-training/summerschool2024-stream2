ven produces trout of the same quality with those in Loch
leven, with pike and some salmon.  The air in the flat
part of the parish is damp, and often occasion rheuma-
tisms.  There are many stone quarries and coal mines.
Coal is the fuel. The mine presently worked is
esteemed the best running coal in Fife.  The coals are fold
on the hill at 6 d. the load, each load weighing 22 stone
Dutch weight. There are 2 moors, both covered with
stones, health, and surze; but being commonties, no attempt
is made to divide or bring them into a better state, which
might be done at small expence.

     Population.-At the time of Dr Webster's report, the
number were 998.  Population has not varied much these
20 years.  The number of souls was then about 1200, and
does not at this day exceed it.  Though the inhabitants of
the village have increased from 150 to 250, the other parts
of the parish have suffered a proportionable decrease, from
a number of the small farms being thrown into one.  Birhts
are nearly 25 or 30 annually; but as the half of the heads
of families adhere to some or other of the Sectaries, the
births of their children cannot be well ascertained; as few
of them are inclined to have their names recorded in the
parish register, which subjects them to small expence.
There are 34 farms in this parish, besides cottagers and
seuers.  The trades are weavers, employed by the manu-
facturers in the coast towns, with masons, etc.

   Agriculture, etc.-Plantations are in a very properous
state in many places.  The extent of the parish is about 6000
acres nearly.  The whole rent in money and victual is about
L. 3000 yearly.  There is scarcely one-third of the land in
tillage.  Above two-thirds in pasturage.  The parish is suffi-
cient to supply itself in provisions, and can send to maket
