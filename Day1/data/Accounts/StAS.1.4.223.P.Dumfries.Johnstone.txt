sometimes 8 d. butter at times 8 d. oftener 9 d. Scotch
weight, or 24 oz. the pound, skimmed milk-cheese 3 d. the
pound, sweet milk ditto 6 d. Scotch weight.  Barley and
oats always fluctuating; average price of the former, L. 2,
10 s. ditto of the latter, L. 2, 2 s. the Moffat boll.The or-
dinary hire of a day-labourer is 6 d. in the short days, and
8 d. when the days are long, with their meat, or 10 d. and
1 s. without victuals; tailors 8 d. though till of late only
6 d. with victuals; carpenters and masons 1s. a-day,
with meat, or 1 s. 6 d. without it.  This so long as there
are 12 hours of day-light; when less, their wages are redu-
ced 2 d. a-day.  For peat and hay-making, men 8d. wo-

rest, to allow them as much ground for potatoes, as their
ashes, etc. can manure, to lead out their ashes, and to plant,
and in harvest to raise their potatoes with his own plough.
A part of his agreement with them likewise is to bring
home their peats; for this he is recompensed by occasional
labour, which seldom precents the cottager from earning his
day's hire.-Another circumstance in favour of such fami-

as they reach 7 or 8 years, they can all be employed, at
