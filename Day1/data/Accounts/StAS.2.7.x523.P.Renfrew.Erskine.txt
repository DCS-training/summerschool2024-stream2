nister to draw this feu-duty. The sun indeed, is sufficiently
trifling, yet, it is to be regretted, that any thing belonging to the
cure, and tending to establish its antiquity, should, through care-
lessness, have been lost. The stipend paid to the minister, pre-
vious to 1831, was 15 chalders half meal, half barley; at the
time, however, it was raised to 17 chalders, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for
communion elements.
  There has been no regular register kept of the incumbents
of Erskine, and it is therefore impossible to say whether the
following list includes all who have served the cure since
1600 : "Robert Sempill, vicar of Erskine, deceist in the
moneth of December in the zier of God 1600." He seems, to
have been succeeded in 1602 by William Brisbane, parson of Ers-
kine, a son of John Brisbane, laird of Bishopton, the first Protest-
ant minister. In 1642, he was succeeded by his son, Matthew
Brisbane, a man of great worth and abilities. In 1649, Thomas
Hall, from Ireland, was appointed minister, and after him William
Thomson, though in what year is uncertain. William Houston
was appointed in 1660, and was ejected two years afterwards in
1662. In 1692, William Turner was appointed; but was trans-
lated to Greenock in 1704. Walter Menzies succeeded in 1705,
and died in 1741. In 1742, James Lundie was presented, and
in 1772, he was succeeded by Walter Young, D.D., who died in
1814. His place was supplied by Andrew Stewart, M. D., who
was translated from Bolton in 1815, and died in December 1838.
The present incumbent was ordained assistant and successor to
his father on the 16th March 1837.
  The old church, which was supposed to have been built in Pop-
ish times, having become ruinous, was pulled down in 1813, and
the benetier, which held the holy water at the principal entrance, is
still to be seen lying in the churchyard. It was situated in the
middle, of the church-yard ; but the new one has been built at a
little distance from it, on a site granted, by Lord Blantyre. It is
tO be regretted, that, when a new church was about to be built,
the heritors had not fixed on a more central situation for it and
one which would have proved more convenient to the majority,
the parishioners,-for, situated as it is, at a distahce of one mile
from the eastern, and seven from the western extremity or the pa-
rish, the inhabitants of the last-mentioned quarter cannot usually
attend their own parish church in winter, and have to seek accom-
modation in the parish church and Cameronian chapel at Kilmal-
