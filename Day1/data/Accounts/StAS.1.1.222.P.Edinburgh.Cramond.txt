     Statistical Account

   Parochial Funds.-The parochial funds amount to above
L. 1220, yielding an annual rent of above L. 56; the collec-
tions at the church doors come to about L. 39; and the pro-
fits of the more cloths to above L. 7 annually; making a total
yearly income of above L. 102.  With this sum, 41 ordinary,
and 16 extraordinary poor, are supported and relieved, ac-
cording to their several necessities;  after which there com-
monly remains a small surplus, at the end of each year, to
augment the capital fund.  This is stated from the average
of the receipts and disbursements for 10 years past, including
in the former the collections sacramental occasions, the ave-
rage of which L. 6: 4:0 anually; a trifling sum compared
with the produce at the communion 1690, L. 20: 5:0, and 
1691, L. 23: 15:0.  Towards the end of the last, and begin-
ning of the present century, the annual contributions were
much the same as at present, while the average number of or-
dinary poor is now more than doubled.

   Charitable Foundations.-Craigcrook mortification is an
estate of above L.300 per annum, which was mortified for
charitable and pious uses, but not confined to this parish, by
John Strachan of Craigcrook, about the 1720.  The mana-
gers are two Advocates, two Writers to the Signet, and the
whole Presbytery of Edinburgh, under the control of the
Lords of Session; and these managers are, in terms of the
deed of mortification, directed "to employ a discreet person
"to uplift the rents when due, and as uplifted, to employ
"the same as the foresaid persons order, to poor old men,
"women, and orphans."

   Population-The population has of late years diminished
considerably, as appears from the following statement, taken
