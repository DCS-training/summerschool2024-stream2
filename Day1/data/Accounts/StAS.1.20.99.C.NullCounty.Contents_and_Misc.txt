</TABLE>

   A number of returns in detail, equally curious and important as that of
Kincardine O'Neil, are dispersed through the Statistical Volumes.-These
will furnish sufficient data, on which the general state and structure of so-
ciety, in the northern part of the island, may be ascertained.  But they con
tain such a number of particulars, that few readers would have patience
to go through them, were they multiplied over a thousand districts.
   I have thus laid before the reader, a general view, of some, among many
other important articles of information, which the Statistical Account of
Scotland affords, and which it would be in vain to search for in any former
publication-Possessed of such a bafrs, on which to ground their reasoningm
or their conduct, with what advantage will not future political authors ex-
plain the principles of policy, and future statesmen direct the administration
of public affairs! May these labours have the effect or rendering the rulers
of nations wise, and those whom they govern happy! May they be the
means of promoting the interests, not only of this, or of that community,
but of the species at large! And may the doctrines thence to be inculca-
ted, he from time to time improved, until the principles on which political
society ought to be founded, will ultimately rearch their utmost standard of
perfection.
   I shall now proceed to give some Tables of Aberdeenshire, by way of
specimen how such a work ought to be drawn up.
