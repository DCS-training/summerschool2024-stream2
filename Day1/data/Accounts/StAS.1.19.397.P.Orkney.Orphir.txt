was formerly a waukmill, but it was suffered to go into de-
cay, after the introduction of the linen manufacture.  There
are two other mills in the parish, which go under the name
of Dubmills.  These are of no use in the summer season.
   The sea-coast forms a circuitous course of about 12 miles,
and is finely indented with bays and creeks, where vessels
may anchor; one of them in particular, called the Bay of
Houton, is protected by an island at the entrance, and forms
a safe harbour for small vessels.  The shore, except in the
bays, is in general bold, consisting of rocks of from 40 to 50
feet high; and composed partly of whim, but chiefly of
freestone.  The water, within a gun-shot of the shore, is
from 12 to 20 fathom deep.
   Scalpa Flow.-The sea opposite to this coast is a most
beautiful piece of water, being a small mediterranean, of
about 50 miles in circumference.  It is surrounded with
12 different islands, through which are several outlets to the
Pentland Firth, and German and Atlantic Oceans.  This,
particularly in time of war, is the great thoroughfare for
ships coming north about.  It abounds with safe roadsteads
and fine harbours; such as Holm Sound, Floxa Sounds, St
Margaret's Houp, Pan Houp, and Long Houp in the Island
of Walls; where there is good anchorage, and a sufficient
depth of water for the largest ship in the British navy.  The
principal entrance to Scalpa Flow, is through Holm sound
on the E. and Hoymouth on the W.; near which stands
the village of Stromness, a sea-port, too well known to need
description here, and possessed, for its size, of one of the
finest natural harbours in the world.
   Two miles distant from the southmost part of Orphir
lies the island of Cava, a mile long, and about a quarter of
a mile broad.  There are only three families in the island,
consisting at present of 19 persons.  The soil is a mixture
of clay and moss, which, as they have plenty of sea-ware,
