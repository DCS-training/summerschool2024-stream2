   Character and Mode Living.-The people in general are
satisfied with their condition, and are industrious.  It is not
remembered that an inhabitant of this parish has been pu-
nished by the civil magistrate for any crime.  All of them
can at least read the Bible; and the greatest part of the
young men, whose parents could afford but little for their
education, attend the schoolmaster in the winter evenings;
who, for a small consideration, teaches them writing, and
the common rules of arithmetics by which means they ac-
quire good habits, and become useful as farm and family ser-
vants-The mode of living has become more expensive than
formerly among the farmers.-The lowest class of people
confine their taste and expence to their dress; and in this
respect they are not behind others in the neighbouring dis-
tricts.  In consequence of this rage for finery, though much
more harmless, in every view, than tea and dram drinking,
(which pervade almost every town and great village), the
common people, in the country through Scotland, will be
found at present to be living almost as poorly as they did 50
years ago, when their income was one half less; for it is by
no means to be placed to the account, (as some seditious spirits
have of late shamelessly attempted to persuade us), of the bur-
den of government taxes which, it is well known to every
persons duly informed about the matters amount not to more
annually than 2 s. 8 d. on the necessary articles of consump-
tions in the family of a farm servants consisting of 6 persons.
