market for linen yarn, which was brought from all parts
of the counties of Angus and Mearns, and sold here, whence
it was sent to London and Manchester.  A great market, cal-
led Rood fair, was held here in the beginning of May, which
was formerly much resorted to, but is now much on the de-
cline.  About 50 years ago smuggling was much practised here,
and indeed almost every where on the coast of Scotland,
and scarcely any sort of manufacture was carried on.

   The first manufacture, of any consequence, that of
canvas, was erected here by a company in 1745.  It was
carried on, for many yeas, to a great extent, and answered
well.  Soon after, it was followed by another company on
a large scale, and afterwards by many smaller ones, parti-
cularly during the last war.  As the same thing happened
in other places in the kingdom, this article was so much
overdone, at the peace of 1783, that all the great companies
here, and most of the smaller ones, gave up, turned their
working-houses into dwelling-houses, and sold off their
machinery and utensils, etc.  Little, therefore, is now at-
tempted in that line, compared with what was done before.

   During this period, two different companies set up a large
manufacture of coloured and white thread, and were follow-
ed by others on a smaller scale.  One of the larger compa-
nies has given up; but the other continues, and has found it,
as yet, a very profitable brance of business.  It is at present
the most considerable article of manufacture in the town.
Some brown sheetings and Osnaburghs are also made here,
and a pretty considerable trade is carried on, in the commis-
sion line, in Osnaburghs and yarn sent to Glasgow.  The
cotton manufactures have been lately attempted, and various
smaller articles, as stockings, &c. are manufactured.  There
is a good tannery, and rope-works belonging to different
companies.
