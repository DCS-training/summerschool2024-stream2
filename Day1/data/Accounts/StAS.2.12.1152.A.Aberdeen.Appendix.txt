   6. Park's Bursaries.-Founded in 1691, for two bursars, at
L.2, 15s. 6d. each, by James Park of Cranock.  They have been
increased to L.3, 18s. 10d.  Patrons, the Senatus.
   7. Adam's Bursaries.-Founded in 1691, by Dr Alexander
Adam, for three bursars, at L.3, 6s. 8d.  This was increased,
before 1755, to L.5 ; and now, instead of three, there are thirteen
bursars on this fund, four at L.20 each, and nine at L.15, 1Os.
each.  Patrons, the Senatus.
   8. Fullerton's Bursaries.-Founded in 1692, by Mr James
Fullerton, for maintaining as many bursars as the revenue of the
original sum, L.850, would support.  There were, in 1704, ten
at L.3, 6s. 8d.  These are now twenty-six; six at L.14, 10s., eight
at L.14, and twelve at L.12 each.  Patrons, the Senatus.
   9. Watson's Bursaries.-Founded in 1699, by the Rev.  Williain
Watson, for two bursars at L.2, 15s. 6d., since increased to L.3,
18s. 10d.  In this and several other cases, the mortification con-
sisting of a fixed annual payment, it has not been in the power of
the Senatus to improve the fund in the same proportion as where
they were enabled, as trustees, to invest a capital sum in land or
otherwise.  The Senatus are Patrons.
   10. Lady Braco's Bursar.-In 1706, Lady Braco mortified
the interest of L.1000 Scots (L.83, 6s. 8d. Sterling,) for the sup-
port of one bursar.  He receives at present L.12.  Patron, Earl
of Fife.
   11. Glenfarquhar Bursaries.-Founded in 1716, by Sir Alex-
ander Falconer of Glenfarqubar, who mortified the annual sum
of L.320 Scots, about L.26 Sterling for the support of four bur-
sars.  The value of these four bursaries, for the reason mentioned
above, has never changed, being still L.80 Scots, or L.6, 13s. 4d.
Sterling each.  Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain presents to
two, and the Earl of Kintore to the other two.
   12. Ogilvy's Bursary.-Founded in 1723, by Mr David Ogilvy
for one bursar.  L.200 were mortified, and for some time the in-
terest of this sum amounted to L.10, but latterly has been reduced
to L.9.
   13. Greig's Bursary.-Founded in 1724, by Mr James Greig,
who mortified 1500 merks Scots, to be invested by advice of Mr
Robertson of Foveran and his heirs, and the interest applied to
support one bursar.  This fund has not been invested as the other
