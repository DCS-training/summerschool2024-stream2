sides other detriment their town sustained, their schools and
colleges were utterly ruined; and their youth, who were wont
to be trained to probity and good morals, lest to be corrupted
by idleness and wantonness: and, being earnestly desirous to
remedy so great an evil, by the exhortation, counsel, and aid
of the most respectable Master Andrew Hay, rector of the
church of Renfrew, and vice-superintendent, and rector for
the time, of their University of Glasgow,-resolved to restore,
renew, and give a new foundation to the Padagogium Glasgu-
ense, quod pro sumptuum inopia pene corruerat, et in quo, pro nimia
paupertate, disciplinarum studia extincta jucebant.  For this pur-
pose, they annex to the said College, and to the regents and
students after named residing within it, being 15 persons in
all, "for their honest and commodious sustentation, all and
"sundry the lands, tenements, houses, biggings, kirks, chap-
"pels, yards, orchards, crofts, annual rents, fruits, duties.
"profits and emoluments, mails, obit-silver, and anniversa-
"ries whatsoever; which pertained to whatsoever chappels,
"altarages, prebendaries, founded in whatever kirk or col-
"lege within the said city; or of the places of all the friars
"of the same city, according to the gift made to them by
"the Queen, under the great seal, the 26th March 1566."
They likewise will and declare, That the said college, the 15
persons before mentioned, and all others who shall be students
in the same, and their servants, shall be exempted ab omni ju-
risdictione ordinaria; necnon ab omnibus cusloinis, exactionibus pe-
dariis, intra civitatem nostram impositis, vel imponendis.-It is
understood to be in consequence of this charter, that the ma-
gistrates of Glasgow, or a deputation from them, still conti-
nue annually to inspect the accompts of the old revenue of the
college, in which the particulars of this donation were com-
prehended; though the greatest part of it, which consisted of
small ground annuals, is now lost.
