     Statistical Account

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is but little wood,
which makes the country look naked.  The land is thought
too valuable to admit of much planting.  About Brox-
mouth there are some large and venerable old trees.  On the
Links of West Barns, there is a small young plantation, and a 
very fine situation for a house.  The post roads runs from
E. to W. the whole length of the parish, and is kept
in good repair.  There are two toll bars, one at the Kirk
Hill, east from Dunbar, and the other on the west side, at
Belhaven.  There are four bridges maintained by the coun-
ty.  The cross roads are kept  in good order by the statute
labour.-The expence in dress, in furniture of the house,
and in the table, is greatly increased from what was the
mode half a century ago.  This is indeed the case in general
throughout every part of Scotland, in proportion to the pro-
gress of refinement and wealth, in the present advanced pe-
riod of society.  The yearly wages of a man-servant in a 
family is 7 guineas, or 7 1/2 guineas, and a woman-servant
gets 3 guineas; a day-labourer, 1 s. a-day, and a woman
for working in the fields, 6 d.; a gardener 1 s. 2 d.; a ma-
son or carpenter, 1 s. 8 d.  In harvest, the corn is cut down
by day-labourers, and their wages vary according to cir-
cumstances, such as the weather, the number of reapers
in the market to the hired, etc.-There is a good butcher
market in Dunbar; beef and mutton bring 4 d. or 4 1/1 d.
pork and lamb in proportion.  White fish are scarce and
dear; salmon is brought from Berwick.  A hen sells for 1 s.
a duck for 10 d.; a goose for 2 s. 6 d. a turkey for 3 s. 6 d.
or 4 s.; eggs, from 5 d. to 7 d. a-dozen; a lobster for 6 d.;
butter, 9 1/2 a-pound, cheese, 5 d.; potatoes and herrings fur-
nishc a great part of the poor peoples subsistence.
   The grand and important question, What can be done to
butter the condition of the people? remains to be answered.
