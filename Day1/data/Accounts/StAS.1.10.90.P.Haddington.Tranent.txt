at the parish school may be from 60 to 80.  School wages are
paid weekly, which is a bar to the regular attendance of the
children; for many parents, having occasion for their children
at home in the beginning of a week, through a mistaken and
ill-directed parsimony, keep them from school all the rest of it.
   There are at present 7 other schools in the parish, 4 of which
are taught by men, the remaining three by women.  None of
them have any salary except one, voluntarily paid by the pro-
prietors of the ground and the residing partner at St Clements
Wells. About 70 scholars attend it in summer.  At the diffe-
rent schools in the parish, in summer 1791, about 220 scholars
were taught.  There are besides, two Sabbath evening cateche-
tical exercises; one supported by an annual collection at the
church-doors, the other upon the establishment of the Society
in Scotland for promoting religious knowledge amongst the
poor.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The increase of population betwixt 1785 and 1791 was
owing to the sale of the estates of the York Buildings Company
in this parish, the purchasers thereof feuing small spots for
houses and gardens; to the enlargement of a distillery; and to
a new colliery.
