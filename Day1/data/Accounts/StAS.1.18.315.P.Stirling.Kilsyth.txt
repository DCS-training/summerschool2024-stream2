   Characters of the Inhabitants.-The characters of the inha-
bitants of this parish, are as various as their countenances;
as in every mixed society, the good and the bad are blended
together.
   To speak in general terms, however, they are punctual in
their attendance on religious ordinances, decent and devout in
their external appearance, and regular in their manners.  They
are sober, active, and industrious; open, candid, and even
generous in their dealings; loyal to their sovereign, obedient
to all lawful authorities; and they study to live peaceable and
quiet lives, in all godliness and honesty.
   Though divided into various sects, they are to a man steady
friends to the protestant persuasion, and live together in the
unity of the spirit, and the bond of peace.
   Upwards of one half of the inhabitants can trace back their
parentage, for many generations, all natives of this parish.
Independent in their circumstances, and of a more indepen-
dent spirit, they have a high sense of honour, and a great re-
gard to character.
   The above will by many be deemed a flattering picture; and
I dare say, I may be accused of partiality.  My only plea
is, that I have been born and bred among them; upwards of

perhaps better acquainted with their feelings and sentiments
than any man, and though partial, I trust I am too upright to
flatter them.  On the contrary, I must acknowledge, that a-
mong the rising generation, there are many less regular in
their manners than their fathers.
   I have many reasons to be attached to this parish.  Where-
