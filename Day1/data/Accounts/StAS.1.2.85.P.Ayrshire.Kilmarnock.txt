     of Kilmarnock.

local situation, and the frequent rains which fall in the west
of Scotland, is moist and damp, but it is far from being unheal-
thy.  The inhabitants are seldom visited with any epidemi-
cal distempers; and, it has been observed, that when the
neighbouring sea-ports towns of Ayr and Irvine are labouring
under such disorders, Kilmarnock, though to appearance in a
less healthy situation, has been happily exempted.  This per-
haps, may, in some measure be attributed to a rivulet which
runs through part of the town; which is not only serviceable to
some of the manufactures carried on there, but greatly contributes
to the health of the inhabitants.  Instances of longevity, there
fore are not uncommom.  A few years ago, a woman who
lived in the town, died at the advanced age of 107.  Several
now alive, are between 80 and 100; and there is a porter still
able to walk about, and carry parcels, whose age is ascertain-
ed to be 105.

   Population.-The return to Dr. Webster of the population
of Kilmarnock, was 4403 souls.  In 1763, it amounted to
about 5000.  Its present state is as follows.
