   Soil and Produce.-The soil in the low grounds is light and
dry, inclining to gravel.  It is better adapted for grass than
corn, and yields excellent crops of natural hay.  There may
be nearly 200 acres under tillage, scattered in small spots
along the side of the water, but at an average not yielding
four returns, owing to the rains incident to all hilly coun-
tries.  The farmers now perceiving the small advantage they
reap from the plough, and the great profit of sheep, lay out
more in grass.  Instead or ploughing a considerable way up
the hills as formerly, they now let the lowest of their
grounds lie in grass.  They have not turned much of their
attention to the culture of green crops for supplying fodder
in winter, (which is often in great request,) though the
trials made hitherto sufficiently prove that the success is cer-
tain, and indeed the soil is particularly favourable to turnip
husbandry.  They sow chiefly black oats, some white oats of
an early kind, rough barley, a small quantity of flax seed, and
potatoes.  In some farms, there are considerable tracks of in-
closed land pastured by cattle in summer.

   Sheep.-The principal article attended to is sheep, in the
management of which the farmers are much improved.  It
is only within these twenty years that they began to pay
much attention to them.  Formerly they depended upon
grazing black cattle, and the care of their sheep was only a
secondary consideration.  The consequence was, as might
have been easily foreseen, that what they gained upon the
one, they lost upon the other; and, though their rents were
not one half what their now are, they were with difficulty
paid.  The number of sheep in the parish, at present, may
amount to 8000.  They are of the black faced kind, the
farmers giving preference to this species, both on account of
its size and its hardiness.  They have not, in general; come
