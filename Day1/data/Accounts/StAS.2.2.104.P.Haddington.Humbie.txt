                    V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Markets.-The two greatest grain markets in Scotland, Had-
dington and Dalkeith, are nearly equidistant, each being about nine
miles from the centre of the parish.
   Means of communication.-The cross roads to the latter town
are heavy, having several steep ascents and declivities, till they
reach the great line of road to England by Blackhills. These roads
are kept in a tolerable state of repair, by statute labour; but it is
contemplated to put a toll-bar on the principal one, when it will
be partly altered, and otherwise much improved.
    Ecclesiastical State.-The church is in the very centre of the pa-
rish, (exclusive of the intersected part:) it is neat and substantial. It
was built in 1800, and contains about 400 sittings, all of them free.
The manse was built forty-seven years ago, and was then reckon-
ed of the ordinary size; but in 1822 it received a considerable ad-
dition. The glebe is small but of good soil. The stipend being
all in grain varies from L. 250 to L. 300, according to the rate of
the flars. The church is well and regularly attended. The num-
ber of communicants is from 280 to 300. There are two Episco-
palian families in the parish; and the number of Dissenting fami-
lies is 15.
   Education.-There are two parochial schools in the parish, and
both teachers are well qualified for their office. They have the
legal salary and accommodations; but the school fees are small,-
those of the one teacher being about L. 10 a year,-of the other,
about L. 12.
