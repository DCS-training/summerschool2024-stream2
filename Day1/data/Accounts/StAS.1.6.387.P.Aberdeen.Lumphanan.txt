   Ploughs, Farms, and Inclosures.-There are about 56 ploughs
of land in the parish, but sometimes 2 or 3 united, and la-
boured by one plough or 10 oxen, so that there are not above
44 ploughs yoked, those excepted who join and labour their small
crofts in a few weeks.  The ploughs in general consist of 8
or 10 oxen.-There is one farm held by 2 tenants at L. 50;
other pay from L. 25 to L. 30; most of them L. 12 with 6
or 8 bolls of meal and 3 or 4 of bear.-Many of the farmers
have carts, and some of the crosters.-The houses are now a
little better than formerly, the new ones being built with good
stones and mortar, and pinned with lime.-A few have chimneys
and wooden stoors, and are covered with heather.-The of-
fices in general are yet mean.  But as some heritors are now 
allowing payment to the tenant at his removal, for walls, the
houses it is hoped will soon put on a better appearance.  The
way of managing farms is none of the best.-Lands rent at
L. 1 per acre in-field, when let to crofters by the tenant, who
pays little less for it himself, and yet he often labours the ground
for his subtenants.
   The first inclosures seem to have been at Auchinhove,by the
Duguids, who once were the greatest heritors in the parish.-
The dykes there are 6 feet broad at bottom.-Some dykes with
hedges were lately built at Camp-field.  There are a few inclo-
sures likewise at Findrack, but in bad order.  The tenants

L. 10 or L. 12 Scotch or more.-Those who draw the plough, L. 18 Scotch.

increasing.
