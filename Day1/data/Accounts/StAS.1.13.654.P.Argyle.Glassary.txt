in former times, served as sheelings to some of the low
grounds upon each side.

   Rivers- The Ad is the greatest; it has its source in a
marsh in the north extremity of the parish, and in its 
course through the moor-lands from the junction of seve-
ral rivulets, forms a great body of water, by the time it
comes to the low grounds; and in its windings and curves,
it exhibits a beautiful object through the whole strath;
but is very destructive by overflowing its banks in 
rainy seasons.  It discharges itself at Crinan, and abounds
with sea and moor trouts, salmon, flounder and eel.  There

in size 1 mention, is one that runs due N. which is not very
common; it takes its rise from a lake in the glen of Glas-
sary, 3 miles S. from Lochow, where it discharges itself.
There are several lakes in the moor, all abounding in trout.
Into some of those that are now good trouting lochs, that
species of fish has been introduced within our own memory.

   Soil and Climate- The soil in the parish is various.
That upon the banks of the Ad consists partly of a deep
rich light loam, partly of a deep clay, and some gravelish;
upon the E. side of the parish, by Lochfine, it is all a light
gravelish soil; upon the N. side, it is generally a
