have already taken part of their loading within the bar of
their own river, and, for want of depth of water, are unable

   At these two colleries there are upwards of 200 men, ex-
clusive of boys, employed, and about 50 horses:  Near 20 of
the horses under ground; the rest in the gins and land car-
riage.  The secondary employment created by the exporta-
tion, and by the carriage of an extensive land sale, cannot be
stated.

This is greatly on the increase, from the present good esta- 
blishment of the work; the Western Colliery alone, during
