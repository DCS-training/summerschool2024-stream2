   Soil, Cultivation, etc.-The soil is of an excellent quality,
being, in general, a light loam.  This, however, admits of
exceptions, some parts being gravelly, and others inclining to

introduction of drilled crops, which happened within these
last 30 years, has been of singular use in this parish.  The
