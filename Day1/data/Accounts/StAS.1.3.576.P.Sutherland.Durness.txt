     PARISH OF DURNESS.

     (County of Sutherland.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN THOMSON.

     Origin of the Name.

VARIOUS etymologies are assigned for the name of
this parish.  Among others, it is said that Dur is a
constraction of Durrin or Dourin, which signifies, in the Gaelic,
a storm, so that Durness would seem to mean the ness or promon-
tory of storms, an appellation to which the neighbouring coast
is not unentitled.  But whatever may be the meaning of the
name, it is well known, from tradition, that the application
of it, to this parish, took place, not from the nature of the
ground, but in consequence of the Bishop of Caithness dis-
poning of it to Morrison, (Ay Mac Hermaid, as they call
him), a Lewis man, and a nature of a place called Diurness
there, on occasion of his being married to his natural daugh-
ter, or, as such were usually termed in those days, his sister.
This Ay Morrison gave it its present name, to commemorate
the place of his own nativity.  Whatever its former name
mights have been, it surely has been sheal, or summer dwel-
ling of old, belonging to the bishopric of Caithness.
