   Poor.-The number of poor frequently increases and dimi-
nishes; but at present, there are 25 upon the poor's list.  A
good many years ago, Robert Perie, a respectable farmer,
born in this parish bequethed 400 merks Scots to the poor of
this parish.  Some small legacies, donations, and savings,
given and established, when the necessaries of life were
much cheaper than at present, have made up L. 57 sterlings,
which, added to Perie's fund, amounts to L. 79: 4: 5 1/4 ster.
Besides, there are L. 3000 merks Scots, lest by Mr George
Keith, formerly proprietor of Caldham, for pious uses, and
to keep in repair, a bridge over Luther-water at Caldham;
the interest of which is generally employed in small dona-

sacrament is dispensed, will amount to L. 16 ster. per annum.

poor, which yields little above L. 1 ster.  The greatest part
of the weekly collections are divided among the most neces-
sitous poor every week, immediately after dismissing the con-
gregation; and others are occasionally supplied with what is
over.  The money derived from the 2 mort-cloths amounts
to very little.  There are generally no penalties given by
church delinquents; for they take care to get themselves
noosed soon enough to prevent it; and we do not with for

obtained any other way more honourable and humane.
Considering the badness of the church it is amazing that the
minister has any one to hear him on the Sunday, but the
schoolmaster, and the kirk officers who are obliged to attend
