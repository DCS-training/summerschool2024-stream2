weavers, 6 shoemakers, constantly employed within the
parish, besides a number of inferior shoemakers, who, du-
ring the winter months, and half of the spring, are em-
ployed by the small tenants, and afterward earn their
subsistence at road-making, fence-building, ditching, or her-
ring-fishing.  There are 30 boats annually employed by 
the small tenantry living upon Lochfine side in the her-
ring-fishing; each boat requires 4 hands, and from what
I can learn, every one, on an average, clears from L. 20
to L. 25 Sterling, free of all charges.  Tbey fish from July 
to Christmas.  About 40 more of the young men go to
the north herring-fishing.  There are 2 masons, 6 millers,
6 tailors, 3 boat carpenters, 3 joiners, 2 wheelwrights, 2
tide-waiters, and 2 surgeons, and the rest are employed in

*Births, Marriages, etc.-The number of births for the yearly
average of the 10 years, ending 1st October 1793, as taken from the
parish register is 92.  The number of the marriages taken, as above, is
26.  The burials cannot be ascertained, there being 6 different burying
places in the parish; and owing to the frequent removal of tenants,
there are great numbers buried in the different burial grounds, who were
residenters in other parishes, and vice versa, which is the cafe through
all the burial grounds in the country.
