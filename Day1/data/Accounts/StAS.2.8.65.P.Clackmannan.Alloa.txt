ing to the amount of from L. 12 to L. 15 per annum. In the year
1829, a friend to this institution sent, anonymously, L. 250, as
a donation in aid of the funds of this excellent charity, the interest
of which is intended to be always at the disposal of the Society.
   There are now few persons who reckon it any degradation to re-
ceive parochial aid ; and some able-bodied young men, who are
apparently in circumstances to enable them to assist their aged
parents, allow them, without scruple, to be supported from the
parish funds.
   Prisons.--The only place of conflnement for prisoners in the
parish, is the old jail of Alloa, in a room of which the Sheriff-courts
were formerly held; it is now termed the lock-up-house,-the jail
of Stirling being at present that of Clackmannanshire.
   Fairs.--Four fairs are held on the second Wednesdays of Fe-
bruary, May, August, and November. At three of these cattle
are sold ; but the fairs are little more than nominal. That held in
August is the great fair, where servants are hired, and reapers for
the harvest : it is attended by immense multitudes of people
from all the surrounding district.
Inns, &c.--In the town of Alloa are five hotels and inns, at
four of which chaises and other carriages are let out for hire
27 taverns, and 30 grocers' shops, where spirituous liquors are
sold. There are also 11. taverns or public-houses in the villages ;
making a total number of no less than 72, which are more than the
necessities of the people require.
  Fuel.--Coal, the only fuel made use of in the parish is ob-
tained in the immediate neighbourbood ; and a constant supply for
the town is kept at the coal-fold, for household purposes, so low
at present as 4s. 6d. per ton, owing to the generally depressed
state of the coal trade along the river Forth.
