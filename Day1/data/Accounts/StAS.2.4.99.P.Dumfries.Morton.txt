lue, have already been reclaimed, and will this year be under white
crop; and if the present spirit does not greatly relax, there is every
reason to believe, that in the course of a few seasons, an addition
of more than a third will be made to the improved arable, meadow,
and pasture grounds. Inclosures and plantations are advancing
with astonishing rapidity. New erections of houses and farming
establishments for the accommodation of tenants are rising in
every direction, as comfortable and convenient, substantial and
useful, to the occupiers, as ornamental to the country, which al-
ready begins to assume a new aspect. Nor is the change for the
better less observable in the village of Thornhill, where the bene-
volent proprietor, the Duke of Buccleuch, with great judgment
and propriety, is at present expending very considerable sums in
levelling and paving the streets, in forming common sewers, remov-
ing nuisances, providing a supply of good water, and making other
improvements tending to promote the comfort, the cleanliness, the
health, morality, and virtue of the inhabitants.
        Rate of Wages.-The wages of farm-servants, labourers, artisans,
and others connected with husbandry, are various, but are nearly
as follows, yearly. For a man-servant living in the family, L. 12,
12s.; qualified ploughman, L. 16, 16s.; farm female-servant, L. 6,
6s.; dairy-maid or byre-woman, L. 7, 7s. Farm-labourers receive
per day, 1s. 6d.; hay, turnip, and potatoe-labourers, 1s. 2d.; a mower
to cut or mow hay, 3s.; a carpenter or joiner, 2s. 6d; a mason 3s.
In autumn the rates are higher, and vary almost every day, being
sometimes as high as 2s. 6d. with maintenance in the farmer's fa-
mily.
        Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce raised
yearly in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:
