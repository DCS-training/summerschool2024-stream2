	Character of the People.--The inhabitants of this parish are very
cleanly in their persons, and generally appear at church and mar-
ket in substantial fine clothes. Indeed, it has been observed that
the young females, particularly the servant girls, are rather fond of
dressing finely. It is not unusual to see persons of this description
arrayed in silk gowns, with other parts of their dress corresponding.
Their wages are in this way almost wholly spent, instead of provid-

affliction. The food of the peasantry is generally oatmeal porridge
and milk to breakfast, broth, with butcher-meat and potatoes to din-

these articles, they often use, at their meals, milk with cakes of oat-

the families of most mechanics, tea is used, generally twice a day, but
the practice does not prevail amongst farm-servants to any extent.
The inhabitants of this parish are entitled to rank high for their
intelligence and respectability. Availing themselves of the advan-

are generally well acquainted, not only with the business of their
own profession or trade, but also with the speculations and mea-
sures that bear upon the agricultural and commercial interests of
the country. Recent events have given an importance to politics
which the people of this district deeply feel; and the state of par-
ties they observe with a watchful eye. It is only doing the inha-
bitants of this parish justice to observe, that they are strictly honest
in their dealings; that they shew a commendable anxiety to bring
