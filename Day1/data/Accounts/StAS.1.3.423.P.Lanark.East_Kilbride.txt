the greatest part of the parish being 700 feet above the le-
vel of the sea, and some of it so high as 1600.  Oats, of all
kinds of grain, give the best crops; but even these are ren-
dered precarious, by the late feed-time and harvest.  There
is, however, much more grain produced in the parish, than
is sufficient to supply the inhabitants.  By far too much of
the arable land is plowed, and very little of it is properly
drained.  Although the most part of the parish is inclosed,
yet the fences, owing to various causes, are extremely insuffi-
cient.  The roads in general, are in bad repair.  Two turn-
pikes were, last year, drawn through the parish, the one
leading from Glasgow to London, by way of Muirkirk, Dum-
fries, etc.; and the other, from Ayrshire to Edinburgh, by
Bothwell Bridge, or Hamilton.

   Trees.-There is little planting in the parish, except at
Calderwood, Torrance, and Kittochside, where trees of va-
rious kinds thrive remarkably well.  There are, however,
few farm houses but what are sheltered by aged trees, most
of which are considerably large.  It is thought, that if the
proprietors consulted their own interest, they would lay the
tenth or twelfth part of the parish under planting properly
disposed.  The exposed situation of the greatest part of the
land, would require to be well sheltered.

   Commerce.-The farmers have of late paid great attention
to the making of sweet milk cheese; and in this they have
succeeded remarkably well.  From every farm of a plough
of land, there is brought, at an average, to the market, 100
stone of cheese annually, equal in quality to any made in
Scotland; it goes under the name of Dunlop cheese, and
sells, in retail, at 7 s. 8 d. or 8 s. per stone.  The whey, pro-
duced in making the cheese, is used for feeding young swine,
