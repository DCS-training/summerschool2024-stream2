     Statistical Account

670 bolls were sown.  I believe that the sowing of wheat is
upon the increase in this parish; and although I do not pre-
sume to be a judges I have an apprehension, that it may be
carried too far.
   Considerable quantities of wheat, barley, pease, and beans,
are annually exported from this district; several hundred
bolls of oats, and sometimes of potatoes; but the exported
potatoes as far as I know, never turn to great account, which
has in some measure cooled the ardour of exporting this va-
luable part of the produce.  Flax is also raised; but not in
such quantities as to compete for premiums.  It is thought
a severe crop, and there is seldom more sown than what is
necessary for the use of the families, or in order to induce
labourers to engage for the harvest.  The tenant gives 10
yards square to sow one lippy of lint-seed.  Some tenants al-

land here was ploughed by 4 and 6 oxen, and 2, sometimes
4 horses before them all, yoke fellows in a large Scots
plough.  The ground is now ploughed with 2 horses, in a
chain plough made upon Small's construction.  The horses
are guided, and the plough directed by one man.  Here may
be one or two of the tenants who use 2 oxen and 2 horses in
1 plough, and one tenant who has 2 oxen without horses, in
1 or 2 of his ploughs.  If it was proper for the writer of these
facts to give his own opinion, he would be inclined to approve
of and recommend the last practice, especially in large farms.
Every tenant sows a considerable field of clover, in proportion
to the extent of his farm, or the necessities of his stock.  On
every farm, turnips are raised in smaller or greater fields, as
they are intended for the cows and young stock only, or for
such as are fed for the knife.  There is no great attention
given to a peculiar breed of cattle in this district; because
the cultivated lands are thought too valuable, and the weaker
