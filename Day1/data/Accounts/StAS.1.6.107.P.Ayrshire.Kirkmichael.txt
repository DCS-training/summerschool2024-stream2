butter and cheese.  A good many cattle are imported from the
muir countries and the Highlands, kept a year, and sent to
the English markets, or sold to Scotch butchers for the con-
sumption of the manufacturing towns.  Of late, the quanti-
ty of oats raised, and of oatmeal exported, has been conside-
rable; though formerly the inhabitants were often supported,
during summer, by importations from Ireland and the north
of Scotland.  In nothing has this part of the country received
greater improvement than in kilns and mills.  Formerly the
latter were miserable machines, at which much time was con-
sumed, and the grain horribly abused.  Now, there are tyle
kilns at all the mills, and at many of the farm houses.  The
mills have excellent machinery, conducted by skilful trades-
men, and grain is manufactured cheaply and profitably.  As
good barley can be made in this parish, as any where in the
kingdom.  There is also an excellent lint-mill, which, it is hop-
ed, will encourage the growth of flax.

   Roads.-This parish is excellently accommodated with fine
gravel roads, owing to the public spirit of the heritors, and
their wisely foreseeing that it would eventually promote their
own interest.  About 20 miles of road have been made and
supported for many years.  In 1769, the heritors agreed to
borrow a sum to enable them to make the roads at once, and to
take the conversion-money, before mentioned, for their re-
payment, which was accordingly done.  The benefit to the
public has been great, and the heritors have been repaid in part,
but not in full: if they should not receive full payment in spe-
cie, they will certainly be reimbursed by the increase of their
rentals.  There is not a turnpike in the parish*.
