     General Appendix to

   The river runs exceedingly gently; and, except at three
places, it has no very sensible declivity of surface.  The
lowermost of there is the fall over the rock at Craigforth
dam; where the surface of the river is 8 feet above the neap
tides, and 4 feet and a half above spring-tides high water.
   The second stream is at the ford of Frew, which, mea-
suring by the windings of the rivers is 18 Miles distant from
Craigforth dam.  The declivity of the surface is about 3 feet,
and the length of the steam about 200 yards.  The ford
appears to be wholly composed of gravel, brought thither
principally by the burn of Bolquhan, which enters there, and
is the only stream that brings much gravel to Forth.
   The third stream is at Cardross.  It is about 7 miles above
the Frew; and is about a mile in length, running partly
upon a rock, and partly upon a gravel bottom.  The per-
pendicular fall here is about 8 feet and a half when the ri-
ver is low, and does not exceed 6 feet when there is any
fresh.
   From Cardross, to a stream below the bridge of Gart-
more, I know of no impediment to the navigation, except
some few parts of the river that is rather shallow.  The
stream below the bridge is about a mile long; and has a de-
clivity of surface of 5 feet in that space, above which there
is half a mile of deep and dead water.
   The river Goodie enters the Forth about 3 miles below
the Frew.  It rises from the loch of Monteith, about a mile
N. W. from Cardross, aud runs nearly parallel to Forth.  It
is a small river, but, running through soft ground, has made
its channel very deep.  It is naturally navigable for the space
of 4 miles from the Forth, to a mill about a quarter of a
mile from Thornhill, where there is a fall of a few feet from
that mill upwards to the mill of Cardross.  It is also naviga-
ble for a cut of nearly 4 miles in length, made for the purpose
