     Statistical Account

since that period, of the inhabitants of the Kerry, the
greatest number have been bankrupt by misfortunes;
others, by the habits they acquired, came to poverty;
and being obliged to quit their farms, are succeeded by
a complete set of new tenants from the neighbouring pa-
rishes; while the most of the inhabitants of the northern
division, occupy the same lands upon which their forefa-
thers lived comfortably for many generations before them.
   A few instances of longevity, however, might be men-
tioned:  Archibald M'Laughlane, a native of Otter, and
who died in the Kerry, near 30 years ago, was 118 years
of age; and in the harvest immediately before he died, was
reckoned the best hay cutter upon the farm of Kilfinan,
of which he occupied a part.  When young, he was a
man of such known bodily strength, that, although he
was not quarrelsome himself, whenever a squabble en-
sued near him, which at that time was frequently the
case in the churchyard of Kilfinan, at marriages and fu-
nerals, whenever he got notice, he immediately re-
paired to the spot, and his presence never failed to
strike such terror, that both parties were very glad to
cease from the strife.  On this account, he was often
called, as a by-name, Craobh na Siochaidh, i.e. the
peace-maker.  Donald M'Intyre, who died in Novem-
ber 1792, was a native of the parish of Dalavich, in the
presbytery of Lorn, and 96 years of age; and although
he had no education, was a very intelligent conversible
man, of uncommon memory, knew more of the history
of Scotland, than many who had a regular education;
could repeat a very great number of the poems of Ossian,
Ullin, Oran, with a great part of the history of those he-
roes very correctly.  He retained his faculties unim-
paired, till the very last:  and, within 6 days before he
died, declared, he never was confined for half an hour
