quarters by the English border.  It is hilly, but the hills are
green.  The Bowmont water has some pretty large haughs;
and from the minister's manse to the north-west there is a
piece of flat land along with these haughs, for the extent of
about 1 1/4 mile.   About straight west, where this parish
marches with that of Morbottle, there is a loch of more
than a mile in circumference, in which are both pike and
perch, the flat land already spoken of reaching round Ye-
tholm Law till you come quite to the loch.

   Agriculture.-About 1170 English acres are actually un-
der tillage, and though there be some wheat sown, yet the
greatest part is laid out in raising barley and oats, and tur-
nips.  Even the small tenants, who have from 1 and 2 to
10 and 15 acres, from Mr Wauchope and the Marquis of
Tweeddale, have their turnip quarter, for which, on ac-
count of their vicinity to Northumberland, they find a rea-
dy market, getting, when a good crop, some years L. 3,
others L. 5, to be eaten upon the ground with sheep.  Much
more land could be made arable.
   The sheep maintained in summer (not reckoning the
lambs, which are about 2500, and of which 1160 are sold
off whilst lambs) are about 4800.  They are generally the
largest of the Cheviot breed, and if a period of 10 years is
taken, it will be found upon an average, that the best prices
in this country have been got for wool growing in this pa-
rish.  Last summer most of it was sold for L. 1, 11 s. per
stone.  It is the short clothing-wool, and they prefer the
New England tar, mixed with butter, for salve.  In ma-
king the salve for smearing, they take 40 pounds of butter,
24 ounces in the pound, to 6 Scots pints of tar, with which
they smear 140 sheep.  A good many years ago, a trial
was made in a neighbouring parish, farther up the Bow-
mont water, of crossing with the Bakewell breed; but it
