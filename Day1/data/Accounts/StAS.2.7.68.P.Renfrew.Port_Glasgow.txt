   The following table presents a comparative view of the foreign
trade of this port:
 			                       Inwards.
     In 1825, the number of vessels was 72, bearing 21485 tons.

   From the above statement, it appears that the trade of this place,
notwithstanding the disadvantages with which it has to contend,
in a course of steady though not rapid increase. The amount of
revenue collected at this port has indeed sustained a very large re-
duction within the last few years. Thus,

<TABLE>

             In 1830, the revenue amounted to L.243.349  3 1
                1832,      -   -       -        185,426 18 6 1/2
                1834,      -          -         140,294  8 10

   This defalcation may, however, be accounted for by simply stat-
ing, the fact, that the duties upon tobacco, which were formerly
collected here, are now paid in Glasgow, lately constituted a bond-
ing port for that article; and which duties are more than sufficient
to make up the deficiency exhibited in the present state of the re-
venue.
   British manufactures of every description are shipped here in
large. quantities; and in return all the ordinary articles of foreign
produce are imported, including tea, which, though it may not add
greatly to the. trade of the port, will probably realize a considerable
addition of revenue.  Port-Glasgow is the principal port on the
Clyde for the importation of North America timber, for which
secure and extensive accommodation has been provided in the
wood-ponds, which are constructed along the shore in the imme-
diate vicinity of the harbours. The extent to Which this branch
of the trade has been carried on will appear from the subjoined
account of the quantities imported:
