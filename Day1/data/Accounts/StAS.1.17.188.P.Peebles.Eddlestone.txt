   Causes of Depopulation.-The above extract cannot ascertain
the number of marriages which have actually taken place
within the parish, as proclamation of banns is made when
only one of the parties resides in it; but the register of bap-
tisms applies strictly to the state of the parish, from which
it appears, that its population has decreased gradually since
the year 1762, which may be accounted for from the follow-
ing causes: First, 14 cottages, formerly occupied by married

Twelve of the farmers are batchelors.  3dly, Two of those who
are married have no children.  4thly, Other two do not reside.
5thly, Two are widowers.  6thly, Of the 13 heritors, 8 are

may be restored nearly to the population of the year 1775.

horses, black cattle, and sheep, are reared within the parish.
The horses are of the same breed with those used for draught
all over the south of Scotland.  A few horses are occasio-
nally bred for sale, and bring from 10 to 20 guineas, accor-
ding to their age or figure.  Many black cattle are sold an-
nually, some in milk, and some lean to graziers and feeders;
but more generally, since the introduction of turnip husban-
dry, they are sold fat to the butcher in February and March.
Many of them are sold at the fair, which is held annually for
that purpose, on the 25th of September.  The average
weight of cows bred here, is 30 stone, and of full aged bul-
