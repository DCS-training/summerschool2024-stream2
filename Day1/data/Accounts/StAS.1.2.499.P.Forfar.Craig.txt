rish; but several years elapsed, before the rest of the country
began to follow their example.  Of late, however, still far-
ther improvements have been made, particularly by - quicker
rotation of green crops:  The lands are kept in better heart,
and produce more plentiful crops than formerly.

   Price of Land, and Rent.-Rather better than a century a-
go, Patrick Scott, Esq. bought, (with the exception of two
small pieces of property,) the whole parish, for about L.10,000
sterling; and, within these 8 years, that property, viz. Ros-
sie, including Craig, and Dunninald, exclusive of the estate of
Usan, was sold for L 64,000.-About the year 1730,
the average rent of land here, was about 4s 6d. whereas all
the farms, let within these few years, give from L. 1 : 5 to
L. 1 : 10, per acre.-The valued rent of the whole parish, is
L.4275 : 4 : 1 Scots.  The real rent, including the produce of
lime, and of salmon fishings, is above L. 4000 sterling.

   Services.-The meagre look, the tattered garment, the
wretched hovel, the ill-cultivated and unproductive field, with
the other miserable effects of feudal tyranny, and the sure ef-
fects of personal services, are curses, from which this part of
the country, has long since been generally delivered.  The on-
ly relict of this kind here, is, the thirlage to a mill, to which
the tenants, upon one of the estates are subjected; but which
is soon to be removed.

   Ferry Boats.-By the register of the kirk-session here, it ap-
pears, that, upon the sabbath day, especially in time of pub-
lic worship, no boats were permitted to cross at Ferryden.-
Whereas now, they are more employed on that, than on any
other day of the week;-the liberty of modern times having
assumed, or being allowed, a flacker rein.
