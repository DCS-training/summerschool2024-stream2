March to the end of May, according to seasons and situa-
tions.  Harvest begins in August, and in early years termi-
nates in September or beginning of October.  Common or
waste ground is every year diminishing, being converted into
tillage by the contiguous tenants, or planted by the heritors.
There is one natural wood of alder, and several plantations of
fir, ash, elm, and other trees; but fewer than might be ex-
pected from the residence and opulence of the heritors.  The
land-rent of the parish may amount to nearly L. 4000 year-
ly.  The valuation of this parish is between the 8th and 9th
part of that of the whole county.  The rent of fishing boats
about L. 4 yearly each; but from this is to be deduced the
price of a boat furnished once in seven years by the heritors.
About 20 s. is the rent of the best lands.  From 10 s. to 12 s.
for those of inferior value.  The small allotments to the inhabit-
ants of villages go higher, perhaps above 40 s. the acre.
The number of farms is diminishing every year.  From 80
to 100 acres is the largest.  However, a considerable number
of small farms still remain, for furnishing tradesmen and ser-
vants to the country.  Farms are beginning to be enclosed.
There is a white peat (under the name of greasy clods)
which may ne called a bitumen, and some years ago was uni-
versally used for giving light to spinner in winter; and is
still used by the poorest people for that purpose.

have their names from the Gaelic or Erse.  Glossough, Gray
or Green-Haugh.  Kubillock, Burial-Hillock.  Aird of Port-
soy, Height of Portsoy.  Durn, Round, from its contiguous
round hill.  Auchmore, Large Field, Hindrought, Bridge-

tensive, is now divided into many farms, which have all
