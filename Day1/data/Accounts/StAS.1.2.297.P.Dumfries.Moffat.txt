perly corked and sealed, it will carry to any distance, and
preserve its taste and virtues many years.  It is very success-
fully used in complaints of the breast, stomach, and bowels,
in all diseases peculiar to the fair sex, and is a valuable resto-

healing obstinate ulcers, and cutaneous eruptions.  A che-

west from the village, but little attention has been paid to it.

the parish funds, is under ten at present.  Besides, there are
