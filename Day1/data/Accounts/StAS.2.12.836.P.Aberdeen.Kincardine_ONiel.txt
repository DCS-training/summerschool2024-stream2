                Amount of annual average produce of the parish,              L.17,576  0  0

   Strictly speaking, the value of butter, cheese, poultry, and eggs
ought not to be added to the other productions of the parish, as
they are only the means by which the previous valuation of tur-
nips, potatoes, pasture, &c. is extracted. Exclusive of the value
of these articles, the produce of the parish, conform to the above
calculation, will nearly amount to L. 16,000.
   I reckon the average rent of arable land at L.1, 1s. per impe-
rial acre, which makes the rental of the arable property in the pa-
rish above L.5800 ; but this is nearly L.200 short of the real rent.
In general, the length of leases given by the proprietors is nine-
teen years.

   Markets.-The village of Kincardine O'Niel (the only one in
the parish) has two old established markets held at it in May and
September for black-cattle, horses, sheep, &c. Two more for
the same purposes, and two feeing-markets, have lately been ad-
vertised by the proprietor, and, it is hoped, may succeed. A
monthly market, during the winter months, which promises to suc-
ceed, has been established at Tomaveen, in the northern division
of the parish.
   We have a post-office and daily post in the village,-the mail
being carried through it by regular mail-coaches from Aberdeen
to Ballater.
   Ecclesiastical State.-I have already said that the church and
