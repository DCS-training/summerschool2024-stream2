that which is raised in the lower parts of Galloway, where
one may have at a moderate rate plenty of lime, of marl,
or of shells.
   These manures, at this distance, are so expensive, that
few farmers here think of procuring them; yet, of the two
former, some have made trial with considerable advantage.
Mr Newall, of Barskeoch, was probably the first in this
parish who improved any considerable extent of land with
lime, the effects of which are still remarkable after a period
of near 20 years.  The minister of this parish, who was
settled in 1783, having but a small glebe, and,excepting
a few spots, of the poorest quality imaginable,as was ma-
nifest from that small kind of broom which over-runs thin
tilly land; nay, besides in many part so full of rocks,
that most people would have though it impossible to ren-
der these parts arable; yet, with great industry and ex-
pense, not only quarried out and removed most of these
rocks, but with picks and levers deepened the most shallow
and tilly parts of it, so as to render them arable:  and as,
after all this labour and expense, such land would have
produced nothing without manure, he brough lime from
Tongland, which is 20 miles distant, and even from Kirk-
cudbright, which is two miles farther; and having made
a composition of the lime with earth and dung, overlaid
the greatest part of the glebe, and has thus, for several
years past, though on so unpromising a soil, raised as good
crops as any perhaps in Galloway.  Many persons, who
were acquainted with some of the spots which were for-
merly bare rocks, were amazed to see them produce such
crops, and could scarce believe their own eyes, though in
reality there was no miracle in the case:  for when the rocks
were quarried out to a proper depth, and plenty of earth put
in their place, with a dressing of the compost mentioned, it
would rather have been a miracle, if such parts had not
