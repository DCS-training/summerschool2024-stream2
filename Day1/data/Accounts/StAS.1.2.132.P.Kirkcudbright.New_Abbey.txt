labour, and extra hours, earn 15 d. and even 18 d. a day in
summer.  A woman working at hay, weeding, &c. earns
4 d. a day, with victuals, or 7 d. without them; at carrying
peats, and reaping in the harvest, 8 d. in the former cafe, and
1 s. in the latter, is the common wages for that sex.  Spinning
yarn, or factory-yarn, as it is called, employs many women,
especially in winter and spring; but they make sorry wages of
it, not above 3 d. per day;-which can afford very scanty food,
when firing, and often house-rent, is superadded.  Taylors
earn 6 d. some few 8 d. a day, with victuals;-masons charge
20 d. and joiners 16 d. a day, without victuals.
   Benefit-men, mentioned above, are now much less employ-
ed than formerly, so that there are not above 3 now in the
parish, as the farmers find their account in preferring house-
servants, because the latter are always at hand, under few-
er temptations to dishonesty, and cost L. 2 or L. 3 a year less
than the other.  Unless villages, however, are scattered up
and down the country, where the farmer can find day or job
labourers to execute his extra work at hay, peats, harvest,
&c. either benefit-men, or supernumerary servants will be
necessary, nor will it always be possible to procure them.  Col-
lecting people into villages, therefore, cannot be too much
encouraged.

   Fisheries.-The fish in the river Nith at this place are salmon,
slounders, and a few small cod and whitings.  The quantity
of salmon caught is very trissling, and is far from recompensing
the time consumed in that employment; so that now it is but
little followed*.  The slounders are found in great abundance,

*The methods of catching the salmon in this parish are similar
to those described in the statistical account of Dornock, p. 15. ex-
