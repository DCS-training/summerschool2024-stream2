			PARISH OF CUMMERTREES.

		PRESBYTERY OF ANNAN, SYNOD OF DUMFRIES.

		THE REV. GEORGE GILLESPIE MINISTER.


		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Boundaries, &c.-IN the charter-deeds of the 12th cen-
tury, the name of the parish is Cumbertrees, which Chalmers in
his Caledonia derives from the three British words, Cum-ber-
tres, signifying "the hamlet at the end of the short valley"--and
probably referring to a hamlet or village, not on the site of the pre-
sent village of Cummertrees, but more to the south, and nearer
to the sea than the present village, upon a small piece of level
ground, at the end of a short valley, formed into an angle by two
streams, meeting in front, and taking from thence a lateral direc-
tion to the sea. Some of the old inhabitants still remember se-
veral houses standing upon the site referred to; and from the great
number of hearth stones dug up, and the quantity of charred wood
found by the farmer in ploughing the ground, there is reason to
believe that at one time it had been a hamlet of considerable size.
Many, however, are of the opinion that the parish got the name
of Cummertrees, from its being formerly covered with timber ;
large quantities of which are still found in the different mosses
throughout the parish.
	Cummertrees, (including the parish or chapelry of Trailtrow, an-
nexed to it since the Reformation,) is about 7 miles in its greatest
length, and about 4 in its greatest breadth, containing upwards of
8000 Scotch acres.
	It is bounded on the south by the Solway Frith; on the east,
by the parishes of Annan, Hoddam, and St Mungo; by Dalton
on the north; and Ruthwell on the west. In its form it is exceed-
ingly irregular, especially on the east; whilst an arm of Cummer-
trees extends to the bridge at the burgh of Annan, a broad belt of
Annan parish penetrates nearly to its centre.
