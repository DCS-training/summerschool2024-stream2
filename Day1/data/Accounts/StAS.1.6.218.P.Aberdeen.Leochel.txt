     Statistical Account

   Exports, Woods, Fuel, and Roads.-The parish annually,
at an average, sends to Aberdeen, or to the interior parts of
the country, from 600 to 800 bolls of oat meal, and from 200
to 300 bolls of bear, except in bad seasons, when the crops
are deficient.
   Around the castle of Craigivar, there are plenty of good old
ash and plane trees, about 200 acres of excellent thriving wood,
consisting of oak, birch, Scotch pine, spruce and larix firs;
but there are no other trees in the parish, except some hard wood
in the tenants yards, some full grown ash and plane trees a-
round the castle of Corse, and, hard by it, a small plantation
of birch and fir.
   There is no peat in the parish, except the lands of Corse, so
that the inhabitants are but very poorly provided with fire.  They
are supplied with turf and heather from the muirs, and a fort of
green sods, called plouds, which they cast in the exhausted mos-
ses.  Some bring black peat from a great distance for drying their
grain.  Were the coal-duty removed, it would be a great mean
of redressing this grievance.
   The public roads are made and repaired by the statute-la-
bour Every man, from 15 to 60 years of age, is obliged to
work 3 days in summer, and 3 in autumn, or to pay 1 s. 6d.
for the whole yearly labour.  The roads, as yet, are poorly
