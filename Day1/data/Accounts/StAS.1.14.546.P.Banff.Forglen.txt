*The gentlemen are all of the military prosession.  One of them,
Captain Hay, late of the Royals, has now indeed quitted the army.
Colonel Duff of the Artillery, in the service of the Honourable the East
India Company, after long and honourable service, and joining as a vo-
lunteer in prosecuting the war against Tippoo, returned from India upon
the peace, and is now enjoying the ottum cum dignitate.  The Right 
Honourable Lord Banff, oldest Captain of the lomfkillings, is in the actual
service of his country, under His Royal Highness the Duke of York.
With his Lordship are two young men from this parish; and other two
soldiers of the 53 d, brothers, of the name of Gallant, who, both at the
siege of Valenciennes, and defence of New-Port, behaved most gallant-
ly.-The absurd system of France is universally detested.  The cruelties
practised to support it shock the sentiments and feelings of all, and dis-
grace and degrade human nature to a level, indeed, with the most wild
and ferocious beasts of the brute creation.  Say what the world will, the
world, nor France neither, will never be governed by such a system.  It
has exhibited already, and will continually exhibit horrid scenes of but-
chery.  It lays the foundation of constant jealousies, plots, and massacres.
There is no proper subordination of the governed, nor no confidence in
the rulers.  Such a government then, they know must be feeble and
fluctuating, and can have no permanency.  It gives every man an op-
portunity to gratify his private revenge.  He has only to stir a little jea-
lousy against him, as an enemy to the Convention today, and to-marrow
he will be gurllotined without mercy or mediation.
