bouring parishes.  They weigh, when fat, from 7 to 10 lb.
per quarter, Dutch; have from 4 to 6, or even 8 lb. of tal-
low, tron:  their wool gives from 4 s. to 5 s. 6 d. per stone,
from 4 to 6 fleeces to a stone.-All the store-masters of this
parish got the premiums at Lanark for tups, as long as the
regulations would permit them.-There are between 13,000
and 14,000 sheep; about 200 horses, and 800 black cattle in
the whole parish, besides What Lord Douglas has in his
parks.

   Roads.-This parish, is in the centre of the great roads, from
Glasgow to England, and from Edinburgh to Ayr.  About
18 years ago, Lord Douglas, at his own expence, made near
30 miles of the one, and 20 of the other.  The statute work,
which is at present exacted in kind from the tenants, is ap-
plied to keep them in repair, but is a very inconsiderable
part of what is necessary for that purpose.  There are toll
bars on the roads, to which the people are now reconciled,
but were greatly averse to at their erection.

   Manufactures.-No manufactures were established in the
parish, till this year, that a company from Glasgow, consist-
ing of natives of Douglas, and men of industry and intelli-
gence, fitted up a small cotton spinning and weaving work, in
the town of Douglas.  The carding is performed by horses,
and the spinning by hand jeannies.  Another respectable com-
pany, mostly belonging to this place, have erected a small
carding and spinning mill on the lands of Carmacoup, 3 miles
above the town, which already gives employment to a good
number of hands.  They are both in their infancy, but there
is no doubt of their succeeding.
