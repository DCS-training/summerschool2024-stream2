     of Borthwick.

   Antiquities.-About a mile and a half below this place,
there is on the lands of Harvieston, beautifully situated by
the side of the water, a ruin, which is said to have been
the residence of the family of Borthwick, before they were
created Peers, or had risen to such eminence in this coun-
try.  About the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th
century, lived a Sir William Borthwick, who, being a man
of every great parts, was employed as an ambassador on se-
veral important negotiations, and concerned in most of the
public transactions of his time.  This William appears to
have been created Lord Borthwick before the year 1430;
for, in October that year, at the baptism of the King's two
sons, several Knight were created, and among the rest
William, son and heir of Lord Borthwick.  He obtained
from King James I. of Scotland, a licence to build a castle
on the lands of Lochwarret, Ad construendam arcem
in illo loco qui vulgariter dicitur le motte de Lochwarret.
This grant was obtained by a charter under the Great Seal
in the year 1430.  A stately and most magnificent castle
was accordingly reared, and afterward became the chief
seat and title of the family.  This amazing mais of build-
ing is yet upon the whole very entire, and of astonishing
strength.  There is indeed in the middle of the east wall
a considerable breach; but whether this hath been occa-
sioned by a slash of lightning, or by the influence of the
weather, or by some original detect in the building, cannot
now with certainty be determined.  The form of this ve-
nerable structure is nearly square, being 74 by 68 feet
without the walls, but having on the W. side a large open-
ing, which seems to have been intended to give light to
the principal apartments.  The walls themselves, which
are of hewn stone without and within, and most firmly
cemented, are near the bottom 13 feet thick, and towards
