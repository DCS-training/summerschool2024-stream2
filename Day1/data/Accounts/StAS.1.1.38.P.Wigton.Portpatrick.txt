   Situation and Surface.-The situation of the town and pa-
rish is well known, being the nearest point of the whole
island of Great Britain to Ireland, and the best place for
crossing from the one kingdom to the other, the passage be-
ing only twenty miles over.  It is situated in the presbytery
of Stranraer and county of Wigton.  The parish is of small
extent, being only about three Scots miles square.  The greater
part is moor land, and it abounds with mosses, not only in the
lower grounds, but even on the tops of some of the highest
mountains, where the moss is frequently six or seven feet
deep.  The common fuel is peat, which is in such quantities,
that from thirty to forty carts, drawn by two horses each,
are regularly employed during the summer season in bringing
peats to the neighbouring towns of Portpatrick and Stranraer.

places in the same latitude can boast of a warmer climate.
The common water which pours from the hills is excellent;
and there is a mineral well, which has been found of service

any depth he pleases.  In short, no situation can be better
calculated for a watering place, should the rage for them con-

   The Harbour.- Formerly the harbour was a mere inlet be-

effect of this was, that as there is a prodigious weight of wa-
