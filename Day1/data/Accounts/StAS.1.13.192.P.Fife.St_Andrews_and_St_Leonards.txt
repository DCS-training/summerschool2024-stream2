into decay, from which it is now emerging, by the spirited
exertions of a few individuals.  There are as yet no ex-
ports from St Andrew's grain only excepted.  But from
this port, chiefly is the eastern part of Fife, for 9 or 10
miles, supplied with wood and iron, which formerly were
purchased at Dundee on the river Tay, or at Ely on the
Forth; and the shore-dues, which 20 years ago did not
produce to the corporation above L. 10 Sterling a-year, are
now let in leafe for L. 66.  Several vessels, from 40 to 200
tons, have within these 2 years been built at this port,
which are employed by the inhabitants in the wood and
coasting trades.  In the spring of 1792, Messrs Robertsons
of Glasgow, established in this city a factory for sowing and
tambouring muslin.  In a few months, they collected be-
tween 3 and 4 score apprentices, girls from 5 to 14 years
of age, who receive weekly form 1 s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 d.
according to their age and progress.  The number of ap-
prentices is still increasing*.
   But the chief support of this city is the University, and
the conflux of strangers, who here find excellent teachers in
all different branches.  The University which is the oldest
in Scotland, being founded in 1444+, formerly consisted of
3 colleges, viz, St Salvator's, founded by James Kennedy,
Bishop of St Andrew's in 1458; St Leonard's college, found-
ed by Prior Hepburn, 1512; and St Mary's founded by
Bishop John Hamilton, 1552.  In each of these colleges were
lecturers in theology, as well as in philosophy, languages, etc.
In the reigh of James VI. 1579, under the direction of George
Buchanan, the University was new modelled; and St Mary's
college was appropriated to the study of theology, and is there-
fore distinguished by the name of the Divinity College, or the
