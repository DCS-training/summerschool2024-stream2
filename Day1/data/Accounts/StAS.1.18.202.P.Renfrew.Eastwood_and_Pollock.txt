creasing from the same causes, naturally thinks of raising the
rent of his land.  These circumstances diminish the surplus
of profit which remains to the farmer, and consequently
lessen his ability for extensive improvement.  It is far-
ther to be remarked, that the value of many articles of
life does not actually rise with the neighbourhood of
manufactures and with the population of a parish.  The
price of meal is not higher in Renfrewshire at present
than it was thirty years ago, when manufactures were

employ their money, genius, and chief attention in those
more alluring branches of industry, while the flower and
smaller profits of agriculture are apt to be undervalued.
These are some of the disadvantages to the farmers at-

neighbourhood of manufactures.  Manufactures may be
flourishing, when the manufacturer is fully supplied with
hands, and when his manufacture will not admit of more
active capital, than he has already employed.  In this
situation, the persons who cannot find employment from
