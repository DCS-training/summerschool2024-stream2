The sandstone of the parish having generally a deep cover is little
used, except what is quarried along with the lime. The church
was built from a quarry on Capenoch.
			III.--POPULATION.
	According to the Macfarlane MSS. there were in 1728, 500
examinable persons in the parish, which by the usual rules would
give a population of 666. Dr Webster's report gives 495. In
1778, Mr Wallace found it to be only about 300. At the date of
the last Statistical Account, it had risen to 520. In 1811, it was
993; in 1821, it was 987; in 1831, 1804. The lime-works and
the great improvements in agriculture, especially in fencing, drain-
ing, and bringing waste land under tillage, have been the principal
causes of the increase of population. 206 persons reside in vil-
laiges; 878 in the country.
