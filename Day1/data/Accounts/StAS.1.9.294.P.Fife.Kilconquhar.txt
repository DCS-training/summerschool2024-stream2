   Rocks, Caves and Likes-On the west of the Earl's Ferry
is Kincraig rock, remarkable for caves, which, though some
of them resemble the works of art, are probably excava.
tions caused by the influx of the sea.  In one of them, Mac-
duff's cave, are some remains of a wall, which tradition
says, was built by Macduff, Earl of Fife, to defend him
from Macbeth, who, having murdered his cousin King Dun-
can, ascended the throne of Scotland, and treated his sub-
jects, with the cruelty of a tyrant.  Macduff afterward fled
into England, and encouraged Malcolm, son to the late
king, to return to Scotland and recover the throne of his
ancestors.-Macduff's cave penetrates into the rock about
200 feet, and the roof, being the summit of the rock, is
supposed to be at least 160 feet high, forming a grand al-
cove, projecting over the cave and the sea at full tide.-
The stone of this rock is of excellent quality, susceptible of
fine polish, resembling granite, or perhaps a species of it.  Mr
Gourlay, the late proprietor, had high offers made him, for
liberty to quarry in it some years ago, when the streets of
London were paving; but apprehensive of the fall of some
parts of the rock, and the loss of some of the rich soil behind,
which he suspected might be the consequence, he declined
the offers.  Coal is found in this rock too, which cannot
be worked, as the sea comes so close upon it.  There is a
species of stone in this rock, which is supposed to be marble
of the basaltic kind; a specimen of which is to be seen in
Mrs Gonrlay of Kincraig's custody; its colour is white, va-
riegated with blue, and it is finely polished.  There is a
beautiful piece of water on the south of the village of
