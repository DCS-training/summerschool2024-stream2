     of Wemyss.

   In the east ground of the parish there are several work-
able seams of coal.  The Right Hon. David Earl of
Wemyss, (a nobleman of a great and public spirit, who
kept a particular account of the coal, written with his own
hand, mentions seven seams of coal which he had cut
through in making a level mine from the sea-shore, which
he drove upwards of 600 fathoms across the metals.  In
working this level in 1671, he observes, "I am still work-
"ing that level in stone, with two men in it day and night
"(except Sundays).  I give them 10 s. Scots a-day, their
"bearers 4 s. Scots a-day, the windles men get 6 s. Scots
"a day or night.  I sharp their picks and furnish their
"candles."  The only seams that have been wrought in
this part of the parish for a considerable time were, one 8
feet thick, and 20 fathoms from the surface, and another
much about the same thickness, and 7 fathoms deeper.  The
main coal is 12 feet thick, of an excellent quality, and was
always preferred at the foreign markets.  It was formerly
wrought to a considerable depth by two engines, at Kirk-
land of Methil, which were driven by the water of Leven.
To the S. of Kirkland this coal is cut off by a hitch or
dike, which throws it down 30 fathoms.  This has lately
been cut out under the care of a very ingenious and active
engineer, and the coal is now working level free.  A wag-
gon-way of 2 miles from the pits to the harbour of Methil
is now completed, and every thing promises an extensive
trade; and indeed, from this seam of coal, with others ly-
ing contiguous, it would not be at all surprising to see, in a
few years, Methil rank among the first coal-ports in Scot-
land*.
