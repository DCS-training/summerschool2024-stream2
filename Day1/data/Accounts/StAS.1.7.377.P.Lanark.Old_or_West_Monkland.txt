   Population and Manners.-There are, at present, 4000 souls
in the parish.  The number in 1755 was only 1813.  This
rapid increase of population is owing to the esablishment of
manufactures.  With a few exceptions, the whole people ad-
here to the church, and are regular in attending on religious
ordinances.  About 800 communicants are usually at the
Lord's Supper.  In the present manner of dispensing that
holy ordinance, there is great need of a reform.  Owing to
the crowds which assemble, much irregularity takes place.
It would be more decent in itself, and productive of higher
comfort to serious persons, were every congregation to com-

of controversial Divinity.  Indeed, knowledge of every kind
is universally diffused; and there is scarcely a family that
does not regularly read the newspapers.  The heritors and
elders choose the minister, according to act 1690; and it is
not impertinent to notice, that, though popular elections are
frequently attended with strife and discord, yet here, and in
the New Monkland, which is in the same predicament, the
greatest peace and harmony have always prevailed on these
occasions.  There are 44 heritors, more than the half of
whom reside in the parish.

   Face of the Country, Cultivation, etc.-The old valuation is
6000 L. Scotch.  The real rental may be near 5000 L. Ster-
ling.  A great part of the parish is inclosed, the advantages
of which are universally allowed.  Beside a vast quantity of
natural wood, there are more than 1000 acres planted.  This
beautifies the country, and improves the climate.  We have
many extensive orchards, which some years turn out to great
advantage.  A stranger is struck with the view of this parish:
It has the appearance of an immense garden.  The soil is of
3 kinds; along the banks of Clyde and Calder, which wash
