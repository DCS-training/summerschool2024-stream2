on the west side of it, goes by the same name.  And a
little to the eastward of this hill, there is another rising
ground, where there is the vestige of a trench, and which
goes by the name of Killhills, because of the number, it
is supposed, that were killed there.  Besides, there were
anciently here, 2 cones of earth, about 50 yards distant
from one another, which are supposed to have been raised
as monuments of peace, like the 2 at Dunipace; the one
of them still stands, and is evidently artificial; the other
was levelled, and the church of St. Laurence built upon
it.  These circumtances, and the names of these places,
together with others at no great distance, such as Bal-
castle, Balquhatstom, etc., give some foundation for the
supposition, that there must have been many slain here
and hence, probably the name Slamannan.  Others say, that
the name is Gaelic, and signifies the Blind Man's Valley,
there being a valley upon the north side of the church
from E. to. W., where the river Avon runs.  But as in
all the old writings, the word is universally spelt Slaman-
na, without the last n, there appears a great similarity in
the two last syllables to the word Dalmeny; and I think
it very probable, they may be of the same original.  Now,
Dr. Robertson, in his account of the parish of Dalmeny,
says, that the word Dalmeny signifies black heath; from
which I am apt to think, that Slamanna must signify
some kind of heath, perhaps brown or grey, or long
heath, for file parish hath all originally been covered
with heath.

N. W. end of the parish, there is a point where the three
