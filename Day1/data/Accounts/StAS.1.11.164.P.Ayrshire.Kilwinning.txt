ing done their duty.  Small proprietors, therefore, ought cer-
tainly to purchase their thirlage, at almost any price; and
proprietors of mills ought to free their own lands of this bur-
den, and lay an additional rent on their tenants, equal to what
is paid by the mill to which they are bound.  Thirlage being
once abolished, and farmers at liberty to go where they pleased
with their corns, mills would be erected in the most convenient
parts of parish, grain of course would be better ground,
and at a much lower rate, and a great deal of time and labour
would be saved to the farmer.

   Fuel.-The mosses in the parish are, the Moss Mulloch,
the Auchenmode and Auchentyber Mosses.  This last moss is
supposed to contain more than 200 acres.  In some parts of it,
it is very deep, no less than from 12 to 16 feet.  It produces
very good peats.  When the summer is dry, these make ex-
cellent firing, and are used as such by the neighbouring farm-
ers.  But the usual and common fuel of the inhabitants is
coals.  In no parish, perhaps, in Scotland, is there coal in
greater plenty, or of a better quality, than in this parish.  Very
lately, however, the price of coals has been railed excessively
high.  A load of coals, 8 loads to the ton, which, 50 years
ago, cost from 3 d. to 4 d. at the coal pit, is now 8 d.; and the
probability, at present, is, that it will be advanced to a still
higher price.  This scarcity and dearness of coals is owing
entirely to their not being wrought.  Not to mention the in-
humanity of such a conduct to the destitute poor, proprietors
of coals certainly mistake their own interest, in suffering them
to remain unwrought.  An additional rise on coal, is to them,
when properly considered, a very trifling object, compared
with the rise of the rents of their lands; and this can be ef-
fected only by the improvements in agriculture, and the in-
crease of trade and manufactures.  But it is a fact universally
