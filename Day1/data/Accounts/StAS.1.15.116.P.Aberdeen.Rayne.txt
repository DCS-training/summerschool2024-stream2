   Poor-The average number of poor that receive alms is
from 15 to 20.  The annual sum expended for their relief is
about 20 L. Sterling, which is all produced by the collections in

troubled with beggars, especially from the Highlands in
summer, when we must sometimes serve half a dozen of them
in one day.

now-a-days, to construct a mill.  The tenants pay thirlage,
and are restricted to a particular mill.  This sometimes a-
mounts to the 17th peck.  They pay also multures, or the price
of grinding, which is often the 32 d peck.  They pay also to
