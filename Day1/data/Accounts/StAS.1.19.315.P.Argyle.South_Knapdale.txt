     "Thou purloiner of my book, by thy wife handsome,
     "and thy house lofty; thy tillage easy, and thy
     "farm blest with a happy exposure."

   Who then, in the exercise of this sober senses, would at-
tempt to break the bonds of civil society, when, by intro-
ducing anarchy, he must convert the most darling objects of
desire into our greatest curse?  But to return.
   Near the west coast of Knap lie a group of small islands,
the most considerable whereof is Ellanmorekilvicoharmaig.
Carmaig was an ancient proprietor of this island.  His
whole family consisted of a grand-daughter, who used to
amuse herself by angling on the shore, which is surrounded
with currents, and frequented to this day by vast crouds of
fish.  It happened upon an occasion of this kind, that a 
bone, in place of a fish, came out with her line; the un-
hooked, and threw it back into the sea.  Again and again
it came out in like manner.  Chagrined with disappoint-
ment, she carried it home, and put it into the fire.  The
whiteness of its ashes struck her fancy.  She endeavoured
to preserve them; but, burning her finger in the attempt,
instinctively clapt it into her mouth.  By this means she
became pregnant of the faint, whose supernatural gifts were 
so long to survive himself.  He founded Kilvicoharmaig,
the mother church of Knapdale; and, after a life spent in
acts of piety and devotion, was buried in his native island.
His tomb, a little oblong building, elevated about three
feet above the ground, remains uninjured by time.  The
saint is said to resent, with the most summary vengeance,
the least indignity offered to this monument.  Near his
tomb is a small chapel, built by himself.  It is arched over,
and covered with flags.  Within, in a recess of the wall, is
a stone coffin, in which the priests are said to have been 
deposited.  The figure of a naked man is cut on its cover.
