a single horse cart, instead of a carrier's horse, which is a sav-
ing of 50 per cent.

   Villages, etc.-Broxburn, so called from the rivulet of that
name, the only village in the parish, is now on the increase,
and is let out on building leases of 99 years, at the rate of L. 3: 4
per acre.  Here is an annual fair in August.  Timber is scarce,
and consequently dear; the Scottish pine does not thrive so
well as the oak, ash, and beech.  The great willow thrives
wonderfully, and is an useful tree for many country purposes.

   Roads.-The high roads are supported by the statute labour
and subscription; the statute labour amounts to 15 s. per plough;
at an average a plough pays L. 45 of rent.  The materials for the
roads are a species of basalt rock, which runs in a ridge from
N. W. to S. E. in the parish, and is excellent for that pur-
pose.  A chain of good road may be formed and laid 24 feet
broad for about 24 s. and finished off at 28 s.

   Minerals.-In the parish are a colliery, two free stone quar-
ries, many seams of ironstone, one above and one below two
seams of coal; two lime quarries, but not wrought at present,
whin-stone, basalts, slate-stone, some coarse fullers earth, pot-
ters-clay, brick-day, coarse red chalk, stone marle, and small
quantities of shell marle.  The coal is of excellent quality, rai-
sed at a moderate expence, and sold at 5 s. and 6 s. per ton.
From 10 to 12 pickemen are employed in this colliery.
