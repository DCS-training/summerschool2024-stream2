Scotch, and 4 bolls of pease.  The yearly value of the pease,
with the said sum of money, is annually paid to the collector
of the bishop's rents.  It is handed down by tradition, that a
Mr. Scott, a son of the family of Balwirie, in Fife, was the
feuer; and, to distinguish it from other farms called Craig,
he prefixed his own name to it; hence Scotscraig.  This estate
was formerly the property, and the house the country residence,
of Archbishop JAMES SHARP, for many years before his death;
and belonged to his son Sir William Sharp several years after
the death of the bishop.  His arms are still on the outer gate,
dated 1667.

there is an extensive prospect along the banks of the Tay, and
the country around, it is supposed to have been the place of
fire signal, in the time of the Danish incursions into Scotland;
but there is no record about it.

   Fuel.-There being neither coals, peats, nor wood, found
for fuel, the dependence of the parishioners for firing, is upon
coals brought from a distance, either from the frith of Forth,
or by sea, at a considerable expence.  What is called the boll,
which weighs 8 cwt., or 56 stone English, is sold here at
present at 6s. the boll.  Though we pay no duty for Scotch
coals, they are considerably dearer this season, than ever they
were remembered to have been, which bears hard upon the
