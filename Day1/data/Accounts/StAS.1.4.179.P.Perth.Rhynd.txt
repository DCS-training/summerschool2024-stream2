In general, the soil is fertile.  the ground is flat for about
a mile and a half from the river Earn to the east end of
the hill of Moncrieff, and the soil a deep clay.  A narrow
strip of the same clay soil lies all around the east end of the 
hill, by the side of the Tay, up to Orchardnook;  and from
this strip the ground rises by an ascent to easy, that it is
all arable.  The soil upon this rising ground is light and
sharp, but abundantly fertile, when properly laboured and
limed.  There are besides some haughs, close by the rivers
Tay and Earn, lying about 30 feet lower than the flat
clay soil mentioned above, and some islands in the Tay,
belonging to the parish, all of a rich loamy soil, which,
when the tides are kept off (as has been endeavoured to be
done) by banks, have yielded the most luxuriant crops,
without any manure, for several years.  The air is rather
moist, but not unhealthy.  Agues have been less frequent
than in some places where the air should seem to be drier,
owing perhaps to a stream of air which is generally found
upon the banks of rivers.

   Population.-The return of the number of inhabitants to
Dr Webster was 498; in 1766, it was about 450;  at pre-
sent it is 495, although the farmers who have come into
the parish since that time do not keep so many cottar-
houses; and in some cases two farms have been turned in-
to one.  The annual average of births is about 16;  of
marriages about 4.  There are under 10 years of age 126;
between 10 and 20, 97;  between 20 and 50, 182;  between

235, females, 260;  married above 20, including widowers
and widows, 190;  unmarried above 20, 83;  the average
