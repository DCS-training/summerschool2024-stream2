the example of improving, by inclosing part of his estate
with ditch and hedge, and sheltering their inclosures with
clumps and belts of planting.  This not only added to the
general beauty of this part of the country, but excited a si-
milar spirit of improvement in the neighbouring gentlemen.
But a great deal more in this way remains still to be done.
Soutra-hill is yet a large subject for improvement.  If it
were properly planted and inclosed, the parish of Fala might
vie in picturesque beauty with any in the country.

   Cattle and Rent.-The tillage of the parish is rated at 17 1/2
plough-gates.  About 52 work horses are daily employed,
for the purposes of agriculture, exclusive of saddle and young
horses, which perhaps may amount to nearly as many.  The
number of black cattle, upon an average, may be 177.-The
valued rent of the parish is 1326 L. 7 s. 8 d. Scotch; the
real rent, about 1100 L. Sterling.  In the year 1727, the real
rental of the parish did not much exceed 400 L. Sterling,
which, when compared with the present, shews, in an emi-
nent degree, the now high state of cultivation.

   Population*.-The number of inhabitants in this parish,
which was taken last year (1792) with some accuracy, is as
follows:

*An exact statement of births and burials cannot here be
given, as no accurate register of these is kept, owing partly to
the negligence of the recorder, and partly to the parsimony of
the inhabitants, who do not always chuse to pay the trifling
fees of registration.-There are no remarkable instances of lon-
gevity in the parish, though there are several very healthy peo-
ple between 70 and 80.
