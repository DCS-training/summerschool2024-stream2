lity of the soil had little or no relation to the rocks lying below.
In some parts, the trap is close to the surface, and, in this case,
the soil appears to derive its productive qualities, in a great
measure, from the decomposition of that rock. This description
of land hs found chiefly in the southern division of the parish; in
the other sections of it, the clayey soil, for the most part, pre-
vails.
	Zooloqy.--The list of mammiferous animals, exclusive of the
common domesticated animals of the country, does not contain
more than 20 of the 52 species indigenous to Great Britain. The
most remarkable of these are, the stoat or ermine, found in Can-
terland den, and the badger, said to be extinct in the vicinity of
the Grampians. The hedgehog, formerly not observed in this
district, is now common; the polecat and otter are much less
frequent. The fox and roe-deer are found, at present, in consider.
able numbers. Seals and porpoises frequent the rocks and river-
mouth, and individuals of the whale tribe are occasionally stranded
on our shore.
	The species of native birds do not, so far as is at present ascer-
tained, exceed 58, and nearly as many have been enumerated as
occasional visitants. Of the former class may be noted, Falco
peregrinus, Numenius arguata, Totanus calidris, Larus ridibundus,
Sterna hirundo, and Anas Creeca. The latter class are chiefly
aquatic birds, which frequent the bay and mouth of the river in
immense numbers. Specimens have lately been shot in the parish
of Ardea einerea (an accidental and rare variety distinguished by
its white plumage), Sturnus roseus, and Coracias g`rrula.

quently found in the river and adjoining sea:
