a large eminence, in the centre of the united and extensive holm
of Dryfe and Annan, called the Gallaberry, or the burgh and sta-
tion of the Gauls, for the term Berry is of Saxon origin, signify-
ing "burgh, mansion, or strength." The most entire is a British
one at Dryfesdale gate, occupying about two acres of ground, and
commanding a mosy extensive prospect. Its counterpart is a large
Roman one about half a mile due east, interrupted by a moor,
standing on the place celebrated for the bloody battle between
the army of Julius Agricola and the forces of Corbredus Galdus,
the twenty-first King of the Scots, about the end of thd first cen-
tury. There are plain traces of the great Roman road from the
borders of England, up to the vast encampments on the neigh-
bouring hill of Burnswark, and thence crossing the parish at Lock-
erbie to Dryfesdale gate, and up to the Gallaberry above-mention-
ed, where it divided, one branch leadhng up through Annandale, by
Moffat to Tweeddale and Clydesdale; the other branch crossing
the Annan, touched an entire and beautiful double fort, on the
northern margin of one of the Lochmaben lakes, called the Woody
Castle, and thence passed up the west side of the water of AE,
through Nithsdale to the west country.
