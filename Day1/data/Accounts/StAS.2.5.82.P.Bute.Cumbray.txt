	Alehouses.--There are 9 ale or public-houses in the parish,
the effect of which upon the morals of the people is most perni-
cious. Various attempts have been made, from time to time, both
to leesen their number, and to restrain thier licentoiusness; but
the misnamed liberality of the present age opposes all such at-
tempts, as enereachments on the liberty of the subject.
		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	There are two things which have frequently been mentioned
as being rather opposed to the improvement of the place: the
largeness of the farms, most of them being of greater extent than
one man can easily superintend and the want of resident heri-
tors, or men of wealth and influence, who might either propose or
carry into effect any plan for the public good.
	It has also been often mentioned, that a road round the island
would be of vast consequence to the parish; both to the farmer
in carrying his produce to market, and in collecting his manure
for the fields; to the inhabitants in general in their ordinary in
tercourse, and to strangers, who visit in the summer months, who
might be thereby induced to build villas round the shore, and
consequently to remain in the place, and thereby increase the
value of the respective properties, and add to the means and re-
sources of the parish in general.
