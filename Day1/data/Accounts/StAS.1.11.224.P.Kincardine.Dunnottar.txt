   Prices of Labour.-The inhabitants of the country parish
are mostly farmers and cottagers, with very few tradesmen;
these latter commonly residing in Stonehaven.  Of late, the
practice, of farmers letting ground to cottagers who do their
work, is much laid aside; and they either keep their servants
in their own families, or depend upon labourers from the
town.  The ordinary wages of a farm servant or ploughman,
living in his master's family, are from 6 L. to 7 L. per annum:
The wages of a labourer, per day, from 10 d. to 1 s., without
victuals; and, in harvest, the same wages, with victuals.  The
women, in this neighbourhood, are generally employed in spin-

as Stonehaven, by which they gain, in ordinary times, about 3 s.
per week.  But of late, the price of spinning has so much
advanced, by the increased demand, that many reach as high
as 4 s. per week.  Of consequence, the wages of women ser-
vants are also raised to about 2 L. 10 s., and 3 L. per annum;
and 1 L. for harvest work, when engaged for by itself.

number of poor in Stonehaven has greatly increased; partly
owing to the cottagers and old people being banished from
the country around, and repairing to the town; and partly
to the luxury too commonly introduced by high wages among
labourers and tradesmen; so that they still rise in their ex-
pences above the proportion of their gains.  The number of
poor now receiving alms in this parish is 71, of whom 25 are
resident in the country, and 46 in the town.  The annual
sum expended upon them, of public charity, is about 50 L.,
of which 32 L. arises from the weekly collections at the church,
upon an average of several years past; and the rest from in-
