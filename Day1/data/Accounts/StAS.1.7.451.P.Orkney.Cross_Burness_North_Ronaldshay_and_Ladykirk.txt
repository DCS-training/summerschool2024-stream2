Ronaldshay, by n channel from 1 to 2 1/2 leagues.-The isles
of Sanday and North Ronaldshay are both of them low and
flat, particularly on the east cost; so that they cannot be
seen from the sea but at a short distance, which occasions
their being so dangerous to shipping.  When the spring-
tides are high, the sea sometimes meets at one place, and
covers the plain, where sheep and cattle formerly pastured;
but this happens but rarely.  In many places the sea gains
upon the land; and, in a few places, the land gains on the
sea, by throwing up banks of stones and sand, which serve as
ramparts or dykes against its future attacks.

   Traditions.-Traditions respecting the incroachments of the
sea are, 1st, That a shoal, 2 miles from the shore, on the
north side of the isle of Sanday, called Rinnabreck, was for-
merly land, and a field where they used to play at the foot-
ball; 2dly, That the Bay of Otterwick, (by some thought a
corruption of Odens Wick, the Scandinavian deity), on the
north side of the isle of Sanday, now of extent a league long,
was formerly land, and that it was covered with trees.  In
support of this tradition, are shown what looks like the de-
cayed roots of trees, along the shore, only to be seen at the
lowest ebbs.  How far this tradition is to be credited, is un-
certain, since Torfeus says of the Orkney islands, sylvis carent;
but, when he relates the stratagem by which an expelled
Count of Orkney, who fled for assistance to Norway, reco-
vered the country from the usurper, he says, large piles of
wood were laid in every island, to be set on fire upon the
fight of the ships that should return with the expelled Count,
thereby to communicate the intelligence more readily to him
who was in possession of the Orkneys, and who resided in
the largest island, formerly called Pomona, now main land.
From whence, then, it may be asked, did they get so much
