that form it.

   Plants and Herbs.-Whilst the mineralogist would find plea-
sure in examining the rocks, the botanist might also be enter-
tained with the herbs and plants, which are to be found either
in the Heughs of St. Cyrus, or on the adjoining shore.  Pro-
fessor BEATTIE, junior, of the Mareschal College, Aberdeen,
who has made botany a good deal his study, favoured the
writer of this article with the following list of them:

the list of native plants: It is undoubtedly, however, a native of Scotland.

in any one specific character.  This any person may be convinced of, by con-
