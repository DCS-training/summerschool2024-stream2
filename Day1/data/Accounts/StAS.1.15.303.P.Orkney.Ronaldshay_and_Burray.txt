they are tumbled over by a gale of wind, they are set up as
before; when tolerably dry, they are put together in one, two,
or three thraves, more or less, according to the dryness, and
built on the field in the same round form, as in the barn-
yard, but more loosely, for admitting air; on the top they
are placed very compact, and fastened to each other, to pre-
vent their falling.  By these means, the invention of neces-
sity, in a damp, rainy climate, an Orkney farmer, though it
should have rained in the forenoon, can carry his grain from
his field to his barn-yard in the afternoon; and he often does
it with safety.

   Climate.-It admits of no doubt that small isles, in such a
high latitude, are blessed with a pure air, and a wholesome
climate.  Of consequence, the inhabitants enjoy perhaps a
better state of health, without the physicians aid, than those
of Mid-Lothian or Middlesex.  The climate of Orkney dif-

North East coast of Scotland, but owing to some local causes,
it is more uncertain and variable.  For three months in sum-

very creature by land and water is in motion, and appears
happy.  In June, the rays of the fun seem unwilling to de-
part.  They retire not above half an hour.  At this season,
when the sun dips into the Atlantic, the appearance of nu-
merous rocks and isles scattered through the ocean, the mo-
tion of boats and ships innumerable, thousands of cattle
grazing on the land, and many more thousands of fishes,
great and small, jumping in the water, presents a scene tru-
ly delightful, and awfully grand.  But sometimes, in August
or September, a strong gale of wind suddenly changes this
scene into sadness.  The same force of wind, which, in the
interior parts of Scotland, produces no bad effect, is, among
