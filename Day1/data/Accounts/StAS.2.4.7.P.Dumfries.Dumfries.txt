			DUMFRIES.                            7

flattered themselves that the visitation would prove slight. On
Sunday the 23d, however, the malady broke out so generally in
the already infected districts of the town, and in the neighbouring
burgh of Maxwelltown, on the opposite bank of the river, as to
convince the most sanguine that his hopes were ill founded. From
that day, the disorder spread with increasing rapidity, attacking
and carrying off, not only the intemperate and the needy, but ulti-
mately many of those whose regular habits and comfortable
circumstances rendered them apparently less liable to be affected.
From the limited nature of society, in a provincial town such as
Dumfries, the danger appearing to be in the very midst of it, the
alarm of the inhabitants was great.
	A cholera hospital had been provided; and the accommodations
were scarcely finished, when its appliances and means were put into
requisition, under the able and efficient superintendence of Dr
Grieve, and Mr Charles Bell surgeon. The patients were con-
veyed thither in palanquins or litters, borne on men's shoulders.
The hospital was crowded, but was not large enough to hold one-
eighth part of the sick; and during the few dreadful days in which
the disease raged with such uncontrollable fury, our own medical
practitioners, although very numerous, were not sufficient for the
emergency; so that the Board of Health was forced to call in as-
sistance from Edinburgh and elsewhere. Almost every one of the
medical men suffered more or less, either from the effects of ex-
treme bodily and mental exhaustion, or from the attacks of the
disease itself. Three of them, indeed, were cut off in the midst
of their usefulness; two belonging to this town, (much and deeply
regretted,) and the third, one of those who,had been called from
a distance. *
