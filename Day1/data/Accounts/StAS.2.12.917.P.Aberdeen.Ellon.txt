humbly submitted that it would be for the advantage of all parties
to allow such a change to be made upon it as might do away with
the evil now complained of, by rendering admissible under it an
efficient guarantee for the repayment to a reasonable extent at least,
by the proprietor in actual possession at the termination of a lease,
of the sums vested bv the tenant during the currency of that lease,
in fixed and enduring improvements.-Another obstacle to im-
provement, which, however, is more partial in its operation, as it re-
spects only the northern districts of the parish, where the posses-
sions are either crofts or farms of very limited extent, is the great
expense that must be incurred in the digging of lines of leading
ditches before the districts in question can be subjected to an ef-
ficient system of drainage.  It is obvious that the removal of this
obstacle to improvement, if it is to be effected at all, must be ef-
fected by the proprietors; as it is not to be supposed that the oc-
cupiers of the crofts and small farms alluded to can have either
the skill or capital requisite for the execution of so extensive ope,
rations.  Were the proprietors of this district, however, to be at the
expense of opening up leading ditches on a sufficiently exten-
sive scale, and were they further to give some little encouragement
for improvements in draining to their cottars and small farmers,
there can be no question that they would reap, even at the expiry
of the current leases, an ample remuneration for the expenditure
incurred, and that such remuneration would be after all, but an
earnest of the profits to be ultimately realized.  Few districts pos-
sess greater capabilities of improvement, and were these capabili-
ties, by the execution of the works above spoken of, once fairly
opened up to persons of industry and perseverance, such parties
even though their capital might be but limited, would not require
very many years to convert into good corn land what is now little
better than a morass.  The climate at the same time would share
in the improvement, and advantages would hence result also to
the adjoining districts.
   A farther, and indeed the greatest obstacle to agricultural im-
provement, which affects the whole raDOle of the science in all
parts of the country, is the want of an experimental farm, placed
under the superintendence of an individual who should combine
with the skill of a practical farmer, extensive chemical attainments,
and particularly a thorough experimental knowledge of the vari-
ous processes of the chemical laboratory.  Agriculture hitherto has
