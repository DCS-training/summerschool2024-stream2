     NUMBER XI

     PARISH OF EAGLESHAM.

     (COUNTY OF RENFREW.)

     By the Rev. MR. ALEXANDER DOBIE.

     Origin of the Name.

   Before the village was built, which gives its name to
this parish, there were several woods in it, particularly
one of the great extent on the banks of the river, an English mile-
south of the village.  This wood, and the rocks in the neigh-
bourhood, were much frequented by eagles; and as they of-
ten perched on the holm, or low ground, where afterwards
the village was built, it was thence called Eaglesholm, or Ea-
glesham.  Others derive the name from Ecclesia-holm, or,
the church in the hollow.

   Extent, Situation, and Surface.-The parish is about 5
miles from east to west, and 6 miles from north to south.
It is bounded on the east by Kilbride and Carmunnock, on
the north by Mearns, on the west by Fenwick, and on the
south by Loudoun.  It is situated in the county of Renfrew,
the presbytery of Glasgow, and synod of Glasgow and Ayr.
The soil is various.  The higher and western part of the di-
strict consists partly of dry heath, and partly of deep moss,
