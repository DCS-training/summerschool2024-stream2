a little further the late improvements in this parish.-About
the year 1770, the Auchinharvie estate, comprehending the
western division of the coal-field, the harbour of Saltcoat,
the Salt-pans, and every thing connected with the colleries,
came into the possession of the present Robert Reid Cun-

places, from the inequality of the ground; 2 1/4-miles long,
besides the long side branches afterwards cut to the mouth
of every new pit that was opened; twelve feet wide at the
bottom, the sides inclined at an angle of 45 degrees; the
