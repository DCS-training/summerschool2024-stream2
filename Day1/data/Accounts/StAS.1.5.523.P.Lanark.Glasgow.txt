   The General Sessions have a revenue of from L. 1300 to
L. 1400 per annum, arising from the interest of sums mortified
to them, and their own capital; from sums given by many at
the time of their marriage; from donations at funerals, which
are never less than L. 5, and never exceed 10 guineas, (in
which cafe the bells of the city are tolled); and from the
collections at public worship, amounting to near L. 1000
per annum.
   This revenue, after defraying scarcely any expence of
management, is laid out in paying sums agreeable to the
will of those who mortified money to it; in paying L. 300
a-year, towards the expence of the Town's hospital, and in
giving about L.60 every 4 weeks, to the particular Sessions,
by whom it is distributed to the poor of their respective pa-
rishes; and the remainder is also divided in the same man-
ner, as an additiona supply to the poor in the winter sea-
son.
   The Sessions likewise of the other religious meetings
in town, such as the Episcopals, Associate congregation,
Burghers, Relief, Methodists, Independents, Anabaptists,
etc. have all funds of the same kind, for the support of the
poor of their respective communities.
   Besides these charities, which are distributed to the poor
and necessitous in general, there have been, at different
times, sundry institutions for particular purposes, whose
funds are now very considerable; and which are managed
by the members, or people appointed by the regulations of
each, agreeable to certain rules laid down; such as,-
1. Buchauan's Society, founded in 1725, for the relief of
persons of the name of Buchanan, and their children:-
2. The Highland Society, begun in 1727, for the purpose
of clothing, and binding apprentices, the children of High-
land parents, who are unable to do it themselves:-3.
The Marine Society, first begun in 1758, and incorporated
