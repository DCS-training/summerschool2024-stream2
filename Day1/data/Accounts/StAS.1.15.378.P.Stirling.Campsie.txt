     Statistical Account

sie, such as Inchwood, Inchterf, Inchbreak, and Inchbelly,
evidently point out, that they were once surrounded by wa-
ter:  Inch, it is said in the Gaelic language, signifies an
island: thus, the Caledonians would find it impossible to ap-
proach the wall on foot; and it is presumed, that the morass was
not sufficiently covered by water, to permit them to cross it in
boats.  Many people, unaquainted with the situation of the
country, have expressed surprise that the Caledonians were so
ignorant of the art of war, as to be unable, for so long a time,
to penetrate through Antoninus's wall; the truth is, it could
not be attacked, but at the extremities.  The natives found
it easier to pass over the Friths of Forth and Clyde, than to
get across the almost impassable swamp opposite to Graham's
Dyke; so that when any incursions were made into the Ro-
man province, it is scarcely possible to conceive that these in-
roads could take place from that quarter which is now known
by the name of the parish of Campsie; from the top of the
Barrhill, where there was a considerable Roman Fort, any
person at this day, taking a view of the country, will concur
in the above opinion.
   About five years ago, a considerable quantity of silver coin,
chiefly of the coinage of Elizabeth, James and Charles I, mixt
with a number of Danish and Dutch pieces, were found by
one of the portioners of the lands of Birdston, when digging
a ditch through a morass; they were supposed to have been
hid in the morass, about the time when the battle of Kilsyth
was sought betwixt Montrose and the Covenanters; the ma-
rauding parties of Montrose's army having stretched as far
West as Birdston, the inhabitants, flying from their depreda-
tions, must have hid this treasure, and have forgot where it
was deposited, when they came afterwards to search for it.
