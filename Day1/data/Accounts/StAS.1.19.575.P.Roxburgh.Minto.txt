     of Minto.

5 lb. of red clover, 2 lb. of rib-grass, half a bushel of rye-
grass.
   Notwithstanding the above mode of cropping, some, of
late years, pasture the first crop, which they find pays well,
and does more justice to the land.

   Kinds of Stock.-The kinds of stock kept or bred:  Sheep
of the Cheviot breed on the outfield; on the infield, or
improven lands, the Dishley or Beckwell breed have been
tried, with advantage, for a few years.  The short horned,
or Teeswater cattle, prevail, and pay the breeder well.
Number of sheep, 1680; black cattle, 380.  Yet it may
be supposed the parish is able to keep a great many more;
but the residing heritors are of use to let, from year to
year, a considerable number of grass parks; and some of
the farmers, who follow the turnip-husbandry, have a fluc-
tuating stock.  Number of ploughs 36.  No oxen used at
present.  Besides the horses kept for the plough, there may
be about 46 riding and young horses.  The harvest in ge-
neral is early.  The whole parish is inclosed with boun-
dary sences, and by far the greatest proportion of it subdi-
vided with ditch and hedge, interpersed with strips and
clumps of planting, which serve both for shelter and orna-
ment.
