Sheep, Horses, etc.-It has long been the farmers greatest    
study to introduce the best kinds of sheep.  Individuals have
much improved their stocks, both from acquired knowledge     
and information, and with more certain advantages, by their
own experiece, observation, and daily practice.  Most farm-
ers keep a part of their sheep white.  Smearing, however, is
still generally in practice in this parish.  It is said to increase
the quantity of wool.  It preserves the sheep also from the in-
fluence of rains, from scab, and vermin of every sort.  There
are 130 horses in the parish, 428 black cattle, and it is be-

1 L. 4 s. the stone.  Seven or eight sleeces go to a stone.

   Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The King is patron of the old
parish of Abbotrule, and Lord Douglas of Southdean.  The
stipend is 102 L. 1 s. Sterling, a manse and a glebe; in all
amounting to 117 L. Sterling yearly.  The church was
built in 1690, and the manse in 1736, both in extremely bad
order.  The schoolmaster is accomodated with a house and
garden.  The salary is 8 L. 4 s. 8 d. Sterling.  This, with
the school wages, and various emoluments, makes a living of
20 L. Sterling.  The number of poor is about 22.  Their
maintenance amounts to 56 L. a year, arising from assessments,
Sundays collections, and the mortcloth dues.

   Crops-The chief crops in this parish are oats and barley.
Potatoes are common.  The culture of turnip has been at-
tempted with good success.  Part of the annexed lands of Ab-
botrule is well adapted to turnip-husbandry.  Grounds covered
