     ADDITIONS TO VOLUME VI.

     No. 1. Page I.
     Parish of Fraserburgh.

     Correction by the Rev. Alexander Simpson.

   There is one inaccuracy, which I beg leave to take notice
of.  In the note, page 8th, the mosses are spoken of as al-
most exhausted; yet it is immediately added, that it would
be highly beneficial to the people residing on the coast, if
some persons would make it their employment to prepare
peats in these mosses, and bring them down for sale; where-
as, in the account sent to Sir John Sinclair, after mentioning
the mosses in the parish of Fraserburgh as almost exhausted,
I said, 'that about 7 miles from the coast, through all Buch-
'an, there is a continuation of almost inexhaustible mosses.
'Were the practice introduced of preparing peats in these
'mosses, by persons who, etc.' The inaccuracy, which has
happened through the hurry in preparing for the press, I
hope you will be so good as cause be rectified in a note sub-
joined to some future volume.
