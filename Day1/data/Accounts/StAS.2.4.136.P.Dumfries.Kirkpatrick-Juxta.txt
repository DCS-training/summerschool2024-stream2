prudent also when he gives in to the collections in an exemplary
manner. It is very injudidious and inconsistent in those, who spend
shilling weekly on vagrants, to give in only a penny each, or a
halfpenny to the collection on the Lord's day. The farmers of
this parish are too well informed and too liberal to act in this man-
ner. On the high and holy duties of domestic charity, it is more
blessed rurely to give than to receive; and as one per cent. on
the land rents almost suffices for aid to the poor, not one of whom
goes out to beg, and who are all sober, and, as far as possible, in-
dustrious, and generally also contented and grateful, every advan-
tage is reaped from the union of charity with gratitude, industry
with economy; the helping hand is here welcome and effective;
and if other parishes were to look to their own poor, those of this
and the neighbouring parishes, would be more abundantly assist-
ed, while protection would be afforded to the public against end-
less imposition, accompanied with idleness, vice, and often crime.
