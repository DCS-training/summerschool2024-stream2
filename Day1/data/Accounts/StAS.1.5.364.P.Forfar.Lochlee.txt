     Statistical Account

the old people remember the time, when wool from this pa-
rish, was sold in Aberdeen, at 30 s. Sterling the stone.
Smearing with tar and butter, is not much practised, except
when the scab is suspected; many of the lambs, are, in the
autumn, smeared with tobacco juice, mixed with black soap,
and a little stale urine, allowing about four pounds of soap to 
twenty pints of tobacco juice.  The tobacco juice effectually
kills the vermin.

   Wild Animals.-There are many foxes in the parish; they
commit great depredations among the young sheep.  Although
the parish is at a considerable expence yearly, in paying a fox-
hunter, there are so many rocks and large cairns, where the
foxes find shelter, that it appears scarcely practicable to extir-
pate these animals by hunting.  A few of them are poisoned
in the winter season, by dragging a piece of salted fish well
spiced with powdered nux vomica, along a hill side, and leaving
it near water.  If the fox comes upon the tract, he soon finds
the bait, eats it, drinks and expires instantly.  The only dif-
ficulty lies in finding open water in time of a severe storm,
and without this, the nux vomica does not kill.  If he does
not drink immediately after eating, he commonly escapes
by throwing it up.  Arsenic would, no doubt, prove an ef-
fectual poison with or without water; but as the inhabitants
are very inattentive, it might be dangerous to use it.  There
are many wild cats also in the rocks and cairns, but they do
little or no hurt among the sheep.  There are plenty of
white hares in the hills, and several deers, and a few roe-
bucks traverse the glens.  The rocks abound with eagles
and hawks, and the hills with moor fowl.  There are but
few partridges in the parish.

   Roads and Bridges.-Until 1764, there were no roads
within the parish fit for wheel-carriages, since that time the
inhabitants have, by statute labour, made a tolerable cart
