     of Udny.

1780, 1034; in January 1791, only 900.  As peats and
turf are the usual fuel, I ascribe this diminution to the ma-
terials becoming scarcer; from which several of the sub-
tenants have removed to the neighbouring parishes, and 
particularly to Aberdeen, where the different manufactures
established there, afford them occupation.  The proportion 
of annual births, taking the average of 5 years to the 
whole population, January 1791 is as 1 to 52 nearly; of 
annual marriages, as 1 to 142; of annual deaths, as 1 to 
76.  In autumn 1790, a putrid ulcerous sore throat, in 
this and some neighbouring parishes, proved fatal to many,
as appears by the above list of burials for that year.

   Ariculture, etc.-The late proprietor of the lands of
Udny, who was one of the Commissioners of Excise, was 
perhaps the first gentleman in this part of the country, 
who raised abundant crops of red clover and turnips upon
his fields.  His farm here, of above 400 acres, he im-
proved at a very considerable expence.  From 200 to 250 
acres are inclosed by a neat stone fence, two rows of elms 
or beeches, and a hawthorn hedge.  He reared riding
horses of an excellent breed, and cattle of a much larger
size than such as were in this country formerly.  Ten or
twelve cattle were usually fattened by the turnips, and sold
for the Aberdeen market yearly.-The residing heritors,
occupy part of their own grounds, on which they are car-
rying on improvements.  One of them has a small farm in 
excellent order, producing abundant crops of grain, sown 
grass, and turnips of an excellent sort, and early.  Ano-
ther heritor, who occasionally resides, has improved his 
estate at a considerable expence.  It is now inclosed by
stone sences, and produces abundant crops of grain, and 
large quantities of hay.  The valued rent of the parish is 
L. 5831 Scots; the real rent, about L. 2100 or L. 2200
