         Sheriff-Court of Ayr.-The business of the law constitutes a
leading profession here. There are twenty-one resident practis-
ing procurators, besides writers belonging to other towns in the
county, who have a right to practise. There is, perhaps, no pro-
vincial law court in Scotland in which business is conducted more
expeditiously, or less expense is incurred by unnecessary delay in
obtaining legal decisions, than in the sheriff-court of Ayr. If cases
are unduly protracted, the fault must be with the law agents, not
with the sheriffs; but hardly any complaint of this kind has grounds
for existence. The ordinary court where cases are conducted by
written pleadings, is held every Tuesday during session. The winter
session commences at the latest on the 15th day of October, or first
ordinary court day thereafter, and continues until the 4th of April
inclusive, except during the Christmas recess, which is not longer
than three weeks. The summer session begins on the first court
day, after the 15th of May, and continues until the last court day in
July. During the vacations, two days are appointed on which
papers may be received in process. The number of cases insti-
tuted before this court during the year 1834 was 431; in 1835,
473; in 1836, 543. Of these, the number advocated to the Court
of Session was, in 1834, 7; in 1835 6; in 1836, 4.
	The Small Debt Court, for the disposal of cases where the debt
does not exceed L. 8, 6s. 8d. is held every Thursday, and parties
are heard viva voce. The number of cases decided in 1834 was
1609; in 1835, 1498; in 1836, 1326. The number of criminal
cases tried before the sheriff and a jury during the year 1834 was
16; in 1835, 25; in 1836, 20. The number of petty criminal
cases where the punishment concluded for does not exceed sixty
days imprisonment, that were tried before the sheriff during the
above periods was, in 1834, 126; in 1835, 88; in 1836, 100.
There is also a Commissary Court held every week during ses-
sion, when business requires it, in which the sheriffs are also judges,
the ordinary presiding judge being the sheriff-substitute. There
are no separate salaries belonging to it, and the only expenses in-
curred are to the clerk of the court, and the agents employed.
There is also a Burgh Criminal Court, in which the magistrates
preside, as cases happen to come before them; and a Justice of
Peace Court is held every Monday morning, for adjusting of debts
under L. 5, and the trial of minor offences.
