   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The wages of a common labourer
are 10 d. a day.  Best male farm servants draw from L. 5 to
L. 6 per annum, the second sort from L. 3 to L. 5; and best
female farm servants from L. 2 to L. 3. 600 women are em-
ployed in spinning of lint, and knitting of woolen stockings;
at which they earn from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. per week.  The price
of all sorts of provisions is double of what it was 40 years ago.
-The fuel commonly used is peat, turs, and wood: the
former, which is found in the parish, costs about 1 s. per cart
load when carried about 2 miles; the turs 6 d. per load.  The
people in general are economical enough; nothing could
contribute more to meliorate their condition than the en-
couragement of industry.-There are about 500 a-
cres planted with wood, in a thriving way: on one estate a-
lone about 300 acres are planted.-Some free-stone is carried
so far as Aberdeen, 20 miles distant.
