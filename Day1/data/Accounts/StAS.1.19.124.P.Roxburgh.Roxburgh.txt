     Statistical Account

differently men in ancient and modern times think of pla-
ces fittest for devotional exercises.  Agreeably, as it would
seem, to the old idea, that the spirit of devotion likes best
to dwell in gloomy retreats, the kirk of Roxburgh was al-
most wholly under ground, roofed with a strong arch, and
totally overgrown with grass.  The people entered to the
place of public worship through an aisle of the same con-
struction, and descended by fix or seven steps into the body
of the church, (perhaps the particular construction of that
edifice had been intended as a kind of security to the wor-
shippers in times of persecution and danger).  The manse
has been rebuilt during the present minister's incumbency,
and might be deemed a good one, did not the very damp
situation render it both particularly uncomfortable and un-
healthful to live in.  The heritors have already been at
considerable expence in repairing it, by renewing the
ground-floor, throwing drains round the house, & c. but all
seems, as yet, an ineffectual remedy of an evil that might
easily have been prevented at first.  It is surely the interest
as well as the duty of all who are bound by law to furnish
accommodations to performs in public characters, not only
to contract with tradesmen, but also to fee the work done
in a place and form that may render it most durably com-
fortable.  The Duke of Roxburgh is the undoubted pa-
tron of this kirk.  The stipend is L. 73: 3: 4, including
communion-elements, and L. 1, 10 s. Sterling in lieu of
turf-casting.  A decreet of modification passed the 3d day
of March 1790, augmented said stipend by a grant of four
chalders of oat-meal, but the locality is not yet settled.
Practices of this kind are not only very much against a mi-
nister's interest, but often prove also extremely hurtful to
