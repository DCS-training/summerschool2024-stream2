shells being found in them. So that the limestone here has 
a very curious appearance to strangers, whether in a whole 
or a broken state.  This gravel, has of late been used, with 
great success, as a manure for the land in the neighbour-
hood. Its excellency was discovered about 20 or 25 years 
ago. They used this gravel for repairing the highway be-
tween Aberdeen and Peterhead, and some years after were 
surprised to see fine white clover, growing very thick on 
those places of the road, which had been repaired with this 
gravel, and every other places as bare as ever.  This indu-
ced them to try the gravel as a manure, which they conti-
nue to use, and find it uncommonly rich and durable.  A-
bout 10 years ago, there was another kind of calcareous 
sand discovered.  This sand is quite small, and has a very 
great proportion of sea-shells, ground to a powder, amongst
it. There is plenty of it on many farms, where it produ-
ces most excellent crops, and continues for many years.  It 
was first tried by a poor man at some distance from the o-
ther kind. 

   Heritors and Rent.-There are only two heritors in the
parish, which, for ages, has been the property of the Earls 
of Errol and the Gordons of Pitlurg. The antiquity and
honours of both these families, being universally known,

whom the greater part of the parish, together with the
patronage, belonged, sold the whole of his property in this
parish, to the late Alexander Callanger of Crighton, Esq;
M. P.  Captain Gordon resides in the parish.  The valued
rent is not exactly known; the real rent is about L. 1250
Sterling, and rather on the increase. The land, not possessed
by the properties, is divided among 58 and 60 tenants, at
various rents, from L. 2 to L. 80 Sterling, or rather more;
besides 16 bolls of bear per annum.  The farms in general,
