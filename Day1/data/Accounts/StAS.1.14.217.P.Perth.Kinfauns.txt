   Roads-An excellent turnpike road, opened lately from
Perth to Dundee, enters the parish on the W., and runs
nearly its whole length.  The leading principle in its for-
mation, is to avoid pulls, which has been so effectually
accomplished, that it goes almost upon a level between
these towns.  The distance has also been reduced; so
that travellers, while they pass along an easy road, and
through a fine country, save nearly as much in horse or
chaise hire, as is equal to the expense of the tolls.  The
proposal of a turnpike road met with universal approba-
tion, so obvious were its advantages.  The cross roads
in this parish are already tolerable, and will probably be
still improving, by having the statute work chiefly ap-
plied to their repair and support.  The statute labour
is here sometimes commuted, sometimes taken in kind.

   Farms and Agriculture.-The farms, in general, run
from 50 or 60 to 100 acres.  A few are larger.  Ex-
cepting gentlemens enclosures, for their own use, there
are scarcely any in the parish; nor indeed do they prevail
in this tract of country, lying immediately along the N.
side of the Tay, or through the Carse or Gowrie.  As
these lands are nearly on the level of the sea, and shel-
tered from the N. by a ridge of neighbouring hills, their
climate is naturally warm, and their harvest early.  The
soil in this parish and district, is more adapted for pro-
ducing grain of all kinds, than for pasture.  Very little
of it, therefore, is employed for this purpose.  On the
lighter grounds, some flax, turnip, and potatoes, are
raised for private use; but, upon the whole, this is a
corn country.
   Our system of agriculture, as in most other parts of
Scotland, has been exceedingly improved within these
