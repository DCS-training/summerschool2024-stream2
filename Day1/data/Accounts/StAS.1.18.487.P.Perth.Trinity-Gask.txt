   The most noted well in the parish is at Trinity Gask.  It is
remarkable for the purity and lightness of its water; the spring
is copious and perennial.  Supersition, aided by the interes-
ted artifices of popish priests, raised, in times of ignorance and
bigotry, this well to no small degree of celebrity.  It was af-
firmed, that every person who was baptized with the water
of this well, would never be seized with the plague.  In
those times, few ventured to disbelieve what was asserted by
the Monkish Clergy; and fewer were possessed of fortitude to
oppose the system of influence, which the Established Church
had obtained?  But the extraordinary virtue of Trinity Gask
well has perished with the downfal of superstition, and the
introduction of a free and rational enquiry into nature and re-

   One great disadvantage, under which the inhabitants of this
parish labour, is their distance from fuel.  The works from
which coal is generally procured, are distant about 20 miles,
and the roads far from being good.  Half the summer is spent
in bringing home as much coal as is necessary for the winter's
supply.  Peats are procured from the moss of the higher
grounds, but not without great labour and waste of time.  And
it is obvious, that the time and labour which the necessary pro-
vision of fuel requires, must be equally unfavourable to the
industry of the mechanic and of the farmer.  These disad-
vantages, however, are common to many places in the neigh-
bourhood.
   The low grounds through which the Earn takes its serpen-
tine course, are exposed to frequent inundations from the river.
Owing to this circumstance, the land cannot with safety be
plowed till late in spring; and even then, a sudden fall of rain
