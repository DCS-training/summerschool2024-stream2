     of Banff.

   His Majesty's late gracious declaration has happily tended
to diffuse greater unanimity of sentiment.

   Ascribing the failure of the negociation at Lisle to its
just cause, the ambitious and vindictive spirit of our ene-
mies, that well judged appeal is calculated to rouse the loy-
alty of all ranks and descriptions of the people.  It must
excite them to express, with united voice, their firm deter-
mination to defend that happy constitution, which, under
the auspices of Divine Providence, is the distinguished source
of all our blessings.
   Meanwhile, the Executive Directory are entitled to the
assurances of our high consideration, for their late fulmina-
ting proclamation, of the 1st Frimaire.
   It is a Philippic which speaks to the feelings and patrio-
tism of the British Nation, in language still more forcible
than the manifesto from the Throne.
   It is a warning voice, conveying to us this friendly coun-
sel,

     Go call thy sons, instruct them what a debt
     They owe their ancestors, and make hem swear
     To pay it, by transmitting down, entire,
     Those sacred rights to which themselves were born.
     Akenside.

from the lieutenancy, at their general meeting in September last:  "The
" meeting cannot omit this opportunity of expressing, in terms of the high-
" est approbation, the very high sense they entertain of the orderly, quiet,
" and respectful behaviour of all ranks of the inhabitants of this county,
" in regard to the militia business.  This propriety of conduct has not been
" confined to one or two districts, but, from the reports of the different de-
" puty-lieutenants, has been universal throughout the county; nor has a
" single instance occurred, wherein the people have not resisted every in-
" situation to the prejudice of the act, and some forward with the most
" cheerful and implicit obedience to the law."
