a hostile state, there was neither inducement nor oppotunity
to move from the one to the other.  The inhabitants often
made inroads upon one another; but when the incursion was
over, they returned to their own homes.  Their antipathy and
resentments were a rampart which excluded all social inter-
course, and mixture of inhabitants.  In this situation, miscon-
duct and infamy at home were the only motives to emigration,
and while this was the cafe, the exchange of inhabitants would
be nearly at a par:  But after the Union of the two kingdoms,
and the decline or extinction of national antipathies, the ba-
lance arising from the interchange of inhabitants would run
much in favour of the more wealthy country.  Artificers
and labourers would naturally resort where wages were high-
er, and all the accomodations of life were more plentiful,
especially if this could be effected without the unpleasing
idea of relinquishing home.  To pass from the Borders of
Scotland into Northumberland, was rather like going into a-
nother parish than into another kingdom.

   Union of Farms.-The monopoly of farms, or the conjoin-
ing a number of small possessions into one, has long been
prevalent in this part of the kingdom.  There are instances
in this, and in the neighbouring parishes, of individuals
renting and farming lands formerly possessed by six, eight, or
ten tenants; and there are instances, particularly of sheep
farmers, holding two, or three farms in distant parts of
the country, each of which was formerly considered as suffi-
ciently large and extensive for one person.  On the whole,
this has not perhaps contributed to make the condition of the
lower ranks of people worse, nor to diminish the population 
of the kingdom at large, though it certainly has had the ef-
fect of reducing the number of the inhabitants in every district
where such a junction has taken place.
