   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls in 1755, was 1698.  From an accurate list taken of 
the catechiseable persons in this parish, in the years 1789 and 
1790, by the present incumbent, from 7 years old and up-
wards, the total number amounts to 1780.  But as there are 
several families of Antiburgher Seeders in the parish, and 
some of the Episcopal persuation, whom the minister at that 
visitation did not see, the number of catechiseable persons, at 
the lowest computation, exclusive of the scholars at the gram-
mar school, cannot be below 2000; so that estimating 1/3 be-
low 7 years of age, the number of souls in town and parish 
is, at least, 2400.  From the foregoing list, it appears, that 
in the town there are somewhat more than 1100, and in the 
country part of the parish, somewhat less than 1300 souls.  It 
is said, that about 40 years ago, there were only 600 inha-
bitants in the town; so that the increase is very considerable. 
Some time ago, there were 2 Antiburgher clergymen in this 
parish:  One of them is now settled in Perthshire.  Secession, 
in this country, is not gaining ground.  The proportion of 
males to females, is nearly as 30 to 27.
