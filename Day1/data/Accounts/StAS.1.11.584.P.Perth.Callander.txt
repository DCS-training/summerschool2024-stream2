lands to such places.  Upon hunting days, the two chieftains
met there, with their hounds, and followers, hunted about the
rock in common, and afterwards separated, each turning away
to his own property.
   Opposite to this rock, lies the hunting seat of Mr. BRUCE
of KINNAIRD, a part of the estate of Kier, where he retired for
several summers, (as much as his conversation and hospitality
allowed him to be retired), in order to arrange the notes of
his memorable travels to Abyssinia, which will transmit his
same to future ages, when the barking of snarling critics will
be heard no more.  His knowledge of the scriptures, of the
oriental languages and customs, his acquaintance with the
whole circle of the liberal arts and sciences, his penetration in
knowing human nature, his address in suiting himself to un-
forseen and incidental circumstances, together with his forti-
tude of mind, and strength of constitution, fitted him for an
undertaking, which, without all of there endowments, would
either have proved abortive, or have been incomplete.  The
grandeur of this scene suited the state of his mind.  There he
found the lake of Dembea in miniature, where the ancient
tract of a river is covered by a modern lake, formed by inci-
dental circumstances, as may be seen from the top of any
neighbouring hill, in a clear day.  Lochlubnaig owes a great
part of its present depth to its being choaked, at the E. end,
by stones and gravel, which are carried down the face of Ben-
ledi, by torrents, in the Burn of Stank.  And, in the time
of floods, the muddy river, which enters Lochlurbnaig at
the W. end, leaving the circumambient water unsullied, and
stagnant, preserves its yellow colour and stream, in the origin-
al tract, for a considerable way down the middle of the lake.
Similar appearances take place in the lochs of Balquhidder,
and many others, where bars are formed, and the water
thrown back by the like causes.
