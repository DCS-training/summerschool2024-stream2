farmers, to fields they had neglected, and incited them to 
follow his example.  Some of the tenants, indeed, are not
sufficiently attentive to a regular rotation of crops; but all
of them are careful to extirpate noxious weeds, pulverise the
soil, and apply proper quantities of lime, which is purcha-
sed at Perth, at the rate of 1s. 9d. per boll, of shells, if
brought from Lord Elgin's kilns; and 2s.4d. per boll, if
imported from England.  Two sorts of bear, viz. barley
and chester, are promiscuously used by some, and separately
by other farmers.  Dutch oats were lately introduced, and
have two valuable properties, namely, they arrive sooner at
maturity, and yield a greater quantity of meal than the
common oats.  However, as they soon degenerate, and are
easily shaken by the wind, it is not likely that they will pre-
vail in this part of the country.
