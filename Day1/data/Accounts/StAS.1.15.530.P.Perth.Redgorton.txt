let the whole for a rent of thirty pounds sterling; now it
is become the seat of two large manufactures, a cotton mill,
and a print-field, and brings to the proprietor of the land an
hundred a-year; but, if we take in the improvement of the
adjoining fields, necessarily connected with these great works,
its value can scarcely be estimated.  About twelve years ago,
Mr William M'Alpine, from the neighbourhood of Glasgow,
a clergyman's son, who had been bred a callico printer,
came to view this country, and having beheld with asto-
nishment the great quantity of fresh water, the nu-
merous falls for working machinery by water, made
choice of this spot for erecting a cotton mill and print-field.
Enlarging his views as he discovered more of the advan-

and showed, in all his operations, an extent of genius, hither-

he fell.  However, the spirit he raised in this neighbourhood,
caught some of the wealthy people in Perth, who hitherto
had not observed their natural and local advantages.  Now a
company of Perth merchants carry on here both the spin-
ning cotton and printing calicoes.  The printing, in the year

into Perth, which afterwards gave the name to this field, which it still re-

rected there, square iron shot of thirty-two pounds weight were found, which
gives credibility to the common report, which has never been doubted.
