their stock which is sunk in improvements upon the lands;
and as clear profits upon the various bargains of sale and
purchase which they transact in the course of the year*.
   This would appear no very considerable return, if we
should compare it with the value of the stock and labour
by which it is produced; and again, with the profits which
the same quantity of stock and labour would afford in seve-
ral departments of trade and manufactures.  Yet it exhi-

the lands, are punctually paid, -without deficiency or liti-

to which they for the time respectively belong.  In grain,

must be deduced from this sum of L. 2000 before the clear profit only
should remain.
