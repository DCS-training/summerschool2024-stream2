     The rapids of a fine cascade in Glenlochay are in this parish,
but the description belongs to Killin.
     Soils.-The character of the soil is almost as various as the di-
visions of the parish are numerous. In a few places, it is wet and
marshy, in in the highest parts light and gravelly, and much of it,
especially in the district of Weem, is loamy, with a strength and
exposure capable of bearing wheat or any kind of crop, were it not
for the frequent overflowing of the Tay, which would be difficult
in any circumtances to prevent, and to which the interfering rights
of proprietors are an additional obstacle.
     Zoology.- Besides the spicies of quadruped common to many dis-
tricts in Scotland, there are in this parish, roe and fallow deer,
mountain hares, which are dun in summer, but turn white in winter,
and are smaller and more fleet than the common hares; and a few
bisons, which are to be found only in the parks of Taymouth. The
rarer species of birds are eagles, black-game, and pheasantsl; the
beautiful ptarmigan, which occupies a still higher region than the
mountain hare, and like it becomes whiter in winter; and a few
capercailzies on the grounds of the Marquis of Breadalbane.
     The principal fishes are, salmon, trout, and pikel; and anglers
from various places resort to parts of this parish, and the districts
in which they lie, especially to Gelnquaich, not only for the sport
of angling which loch Freuchie, and the streams that fall into it af-
ford, but also for enjoying the pure and bracing air of this quarter.
     Botany.- The full account from the parish of Kenmore on this
subject renders it inexpedient to offer an inferior one from an ad-
joining parish.
