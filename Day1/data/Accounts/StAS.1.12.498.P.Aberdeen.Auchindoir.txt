from 20 to 22 stone a boll, which has been known to yield
18 stone of meal.  If the rise of the price of labour be a
proof of increasing prosperity, we must entertain a very flat-
tering opinion of the north of Scotland in general, and of
this country in particular.  Within these 30 years, it has
been doubled, and tripled in little more than 40.  In this
parish, it is pretty much the same as in the rest of the
county.

   Language, Antiquities, etc.-The only language spoken
here, is that dialect of the English which is common in A-
berdeenshire.  The peculiarities of it, a native is perhaps
little qualified for pointing out.  The people in the south of
Scotland say, that the tone is harsh, and to them has the ap-
pearance of passion and bad humour.  Almost all the names
of the places are derived from the Gaelic, as "Auchinleith,"
or the grey field, "Toumriach," or the speckled hill, "Ful-
ziemont," or the blood of the mountain.  The last is the
name of a farm, lying at the foot of a pretty high conical
hill called Knock-chailich.  The hill has been fortified by a
double wall, and the farm has probably received its name
from some bloody battle that has been fought there.  On a
little hill close by the church, there was a castle, said to be
mentioned by Boetius; but no traces of it remain.  It has
been defended on three sides by rocks and precipices, and on
the fourth side by a moat or deep excavation which has evi-
dently been the work of art.  There are several other anti-
quities, such as tumuli, barrows, and some little hillocks
called pest-hillocks, about which last the tradition is too
vague and uncertain to deserve a place here*.
