     Statistical Account

   Agriculture.-The Subsistence of the people is chiefly by
agriculture.  Of the 3710 acres of which the parish may
consist, 140 may be supposed in plantation, 400 in links,
and 170 otherwise unarable.  Of the remaining 3000 acres,
the one half may be supposed in fallow, pasture, and green
crops.  Of the other half, nearly 100 may be supposed in
wheat, and the rest equally divided into oats and barley.
Here the farms are generally extensive.  There are ten
farms that rent between L. 99 and L. 200; two between
L. 200 and L. 300; one between L. 300 and L. 400; one
between L. 400 and L. 500; and one between L. 600 and
L. 700.  Below L. 99 of rent, there is no ground possessed
by any farmer, properly so called.  The other possessors of
land are the 46 pendiclers, who are generally tradesmen,
and hold a few acres of a proprietor; and the forty-two
cottagers, who have each a house and an acre or two from
a tenant.  Here the means of improving land are embraced,
and their good effects are visible.  Sea-weed cannot be
found in sufficient quantity on that part of the coast which
belongs to this parish, to be of use as a manure.  Marl
also lies at too great a distance, as well as the dung of Dun-
dee, much to profit the farmer.  There is, however, a-
bundance of lime brought from the south of Fife, and from
north and south Sunderland, in England, which is landed

tion must have been considerable.  If a calculation be made from the
births, the parish will be found to have increased in number 406, which
is precisely one-third of its present inhabitants.  From the period now
mentioned to the present time, the increase in population has been gra-
dual.  About the year 1750, indeed, the annual average of births was 44;
but that of marriages was only 9; and of deaths 15.  Some years before
1750, a malignant fever had raged, which sent many to their graves.
The extraordinary number of births in the years which immediately fol-
lowed, only filled up the breaches the fever had made.  About the year
1760, the annual average of births was only 35, and that of deaths was
18.  The marriages are omitted in the record.
