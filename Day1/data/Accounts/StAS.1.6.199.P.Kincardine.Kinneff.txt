and a good situation for a village, for the accommodation
tradesmen and manufacturers, might be had in the neighbour-
hood.  The great quantity of corn sold annually by the farm-
ers would be of advantage to such a village.-The next place
of residence for white-fishers is Gap-hill, about half a mile S.
of Caterline.  It formerly had two boats, now it has only one,
and lies in a small bay, on the north side of the Tod-head,
called Braddan bay.  This bay is about 100 yards in ex-
tent, with a rocky bottom, and gravelly beach, where small
barks in summer unload lime, coals, etc.-There are no
quarries except the sea-rocks above mentioned.  They make a
strong, durable, straight wall, but are rather too hard for hew-
ing.  These rocks have been used for mill-stones, and are in
great repuse for that purpose.

   Population.-In 1755, the number of souls was 858. They
have since increased; for, by a very accurate visitation-roll
lately taken up, it contains about 1000 souls.  There is neither
town nor village, nor 6 families dwelling together, (the sea-
towns of Gap-hill and Caterline excepted), in all the parish.
