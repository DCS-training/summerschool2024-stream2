     of Auchinleck.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church of Auchinleck, placed in
a beautiful situation, and founded on a rock, was repaired and
enlarged in 1754.  The stipend, including communion ele-
ments, is no more than 50 L. 3 s. 11 1/2 d. Sterling in money,
two chalders of meal, and one of bear, the latter common
heap measure, or 15 pecks to the bushel; being the same
that was settled by decreet in 1649, since which period no
augmentation has taken place, though all the other parishes
in the neighbourhood have had their stipends increased.  The
manse, one of the most commodious neat small houses to be
met with, was built in 1756.  The glebe contains 6 acres.
JAMES BOSWELL, Esq, of Auchinleck, a well known literary
character, is patron and principal heritor.

   Rent, Poor's Fund, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is
3800 L. Scotch, divided among 13 heritors, of whom 5 usual-
ly reside in the parish.-The capital of the poor's fund, which
in 1752 amounted to 50 L. is now augmented to 100 L. lent
out at the annual interest of 4 and 5 per cent.  The collec-
tions, which, from 1740 to 1751+, were, at an average, 6 L.
6 s. yearly, have for 20 years preceding 1791, amounted to
18 L. per annum.  The kirk-session annually distributes 6 L.
arising from the money received for the hire of the mort-
cloths, for the dues payable on marriages and baptisms, and
the interest of the before-mentioned capital of 1001*.  The

*For 30 years past, the session has never distributed money to the poor, ex-
cept in the way of loan, in order that if any of them get a legacy, or become
able to refund, action may lie against them.  But an assignation to their move-
ables is never taken, because in the case of sickness, the parochial funds would
thereby be loaded with an enormous expence for an attendant.

+Since 1752, the wages of male servants have advanced from 4 L. to 7 L., 8 L.,
and 9 L.; of female servants, from 1 L. 13 s. and 4 d. to 5 L. per annum; of labour-
ers, from 8 d. to 1 s.; of masons, from 1 s. to 2 s. and 2 s. 6 d. a-day.  The price of
eggs has risen from 13 for 1 d. to 4 d. perdozen; mutton from 2 d. to 4 1/2 d. per
lib.; hens, from 4 d. to 1 s.;-beessells at 5 d. per lib.  of 24 avoirdupois ounces;
veal at 4 1/2 d.; and lamb at 3 d. per lib.
