erloch; and, excepting a few, there is not a Seceder in
either parish.   There are four or five Papists in the pa-
rish of Appin, all of whom came from other parishes
except one man, who was converted by his wife, an Irish-
woman.  There are great numbers of Episcopalians, in the
higher parts of the parish of Appin; and a clergyman of their
own persuasion resides among them.  There are four places
of worship in the parish, viz.  Lismore and Appin, Glenco
and Kingerloch.  There is a missionary established by the
committee for managing the royal bounty between Glenco
and the neighbouring glens belonging to the parish of Ard-
chattan.  The missionary of Strontian preaches four times in
the year at Kingerloch.  It is the opinion of the judicious, that
the funds for missionaries and catechifts should have been all

parishes.  It would unquestionably rutn out to much greater
advantage to the public.  Lismore was a Bishop's See, the
residence of the Bishop of the Illes, and , at certain periods, of
the Bishop of Argyle.  The present church of Lismore is
the chancel of the old cathedral new roofed about 40 years
ago, after lowering the old walls frmo ten to seven feet.  The
font and consesional chair remain.  The walls of the Bi-
shop's Castle still remain pretty entire, four miles to the west
of the cathedral.  It has a square open court within.  There 
was a small temple, with a burying ground, on an island,
or rather peninsula, called Bernera, on the farm where the
castle islands.  In Appin, there is a neat, small church, lately
repaired.  The church yad is inclosed with a wall of stone
and lime.  The manse in Lismore is not very good.  It was
built about 34 years ago, and repaired within these 20 years.
The present incumbent, Mr Donald McNicol, was admitted
minister of Lismore and Appin the 15th of July 1766.  The
