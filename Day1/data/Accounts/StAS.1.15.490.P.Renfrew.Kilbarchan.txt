   Ecclesiastical Slate.-The church was built, or rather re-
built, in 1724, and is very commodious.  It is situated in the
village.  There is also in the village, a house of worship for
persons of the Relief persuasion, and another on the hills, a-
bout a mile to the west, belonging to the Seceders.
   The manse formerly stood in the village, and the glebe in
different parcels around.  But in 1752, the glebe and manse
were excambiated, at the request of Mr Milliken of Milliken,
the patron, who wished to acquire the glebe for the purpose
of feuing it for building.  The manse now stands on a beau-
tiful eminence one-eighth of a mile south of the town, in the
centre of the glebe, which is 16 1/2 acres, all enclosed and sub-
divided.  The stipend is 7 chalders of meal, 200 L. Scotch in
money, with an augmentation obtained in 1792, of 35 L. Ster-
ling.  Computing the meal at 1 s. per peck, the stipend a-
mounts to 141 L. 4 s. 0 1/2 d. communion elements included.
The patronage of the church is vested in the family of Mil-
liken.  The church formerly belonged to the Abbey of Pais-
Iey.

in this parish, and resided long at the old Castle of Ranfurly
already described.  In proof of what we here assert, we refer
