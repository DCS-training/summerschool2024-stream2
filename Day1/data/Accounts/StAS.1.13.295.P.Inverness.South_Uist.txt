of that valuable commodity, that its sudden low price,
is owing to the great importation of barilla and other fo-
reign ashes, at a low duty.

   Sheep.-The number of sheep in the parish does not ex-
ceed 7000.  The sheep are, for ordinary, of the small
Highland breed, their mutton sweet and delicious, and
their wool of a very good quality, exceeding in fineness
the wool of any sheep imported to the parish, from the 
main land of Scotland.  There was an attempt made
some years ago, by some gentlemen, to import some black-
faced sheep; but a disorder, well known by the name of 
braxy, got among them, and the cross-breed still die of
that disorder, though not in such numbers as the low-country
breed, originally imported.  There are no sheep, to any
value, fold in the parish, only a few to vessels, who put 
into harbours by contrary winds; the inhabitants find use
both for their wool and mutton.

   Horses.-The number of horses in the parish, at an a-
verage, may be called 800; they are of a small breed, 
incredibly strong and hardly, considering their size.  The
great fatigue and toil they undergo, during winter and
spring, in leading sea-ware from the shore to manure the
ground for barley and potatoes; add to this, the making
of kelp in summer, and their feeding on sandy soil, for the
greatest part of the year, all this of course must soon render
them useless.  Rearing, and buying horses in this parish, is one 
of the greatest disadvantages; for without the labour of hor-
ses, the kelp is unmanufactured in summer, and the ground
unmanured in winter.  A young horse or mare, fit for
labouring, cannot now be purchased below L. 5 Ster-
ling.
