     of the University of Glasgow.

   Capital TriaL-There is, however, only one instance on
record of a capital trial before the rector's court; and that so
late as the year 1670.  That year, ROBERT BARTOUNE, a
student, was indicted for murder, before Sir WILLIAM FLEE-
MING, rector; but was acquitted by the jury.

     II. ANCIENT CONSTITUTION.

   THE constitution of this learned body will appear, by tak-
ing a view of the parts into which it was divided, and the
powers and obligations of each.

   1. Election of the Office Bearers, etc.-The whole incorporated
members, students, as well as doctors and masters, were di-
vided into four parts, called the Quatour Nationes, according
to the place of their nativity.  The whole realm of Scotland,
and the Isles, was distinguished into four districts, under the
names of Clydesdale, Teviotdale, Albany, and Rothesay.  A meet-
ing of the whole University was annually called, on the day
next after St. Crispin's day.  This meeting was called the
Congregatio Universitatis: and, being divided into the four na-
tions, each nation, by itself, chose a procurator and an in-
trant; and the intrants, meeting by themselves, made choice
of a rector and a deputatus of each nation, who were assistants
and assessors to the rector.

   Fuctions.-The rector and deputati had several functions.
   1st, They were judges in all civil and criminal causes, where-
in any member of the University was a party.  Every member,
who either sued or answered before any other court, was guil-
ty of perjury, and incurred the penalty of expulsion.  The
eeclesiastics in the University, to whatever diocese they be-
longed, could not be called before their rural deans.
