acres Scotch; although I believe there was never any actual sur-

toes or turnip, wheat either after summer fallow, or potatoes, and
some, barley. Flax is now very seldom raised in the parish: though
formerly almost every farmer raised a little for family use. The
land is generally all well enclosed, either with stone dikes, or thorn
and beech hedges, and sheltered with thriving plantations in many
