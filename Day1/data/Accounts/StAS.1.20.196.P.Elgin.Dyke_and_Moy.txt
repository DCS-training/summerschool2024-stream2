large masses.  It must be carefully avoided by the plough,
as destructive of vegetation.  A judicious use of lime,
which could be had from Sunderland at 4 d. per meal firlot,
would, by attracting the dews, bring a more copious supply
of nightly moisture; and a plentiful use of the lighter clays,
even in compost dunghills, would give a firmer texture to
the soil, to retain the moisture which it receives, and would

by intermixing the barren surface of turfed moors, and by
heaping on sand where there is already more than enough.

   At the back shore, behind Cullen, there are beds of
cockles of the best quality.  They are the prequisite of the
poor, who rake them out of the sand at ebb of tide, both for

seemed to exceed the rent.  But, at the increased prices of
