   Fisheries, Manufactures, Markets, etc.-Bervie seems at
some period to have been a considerable fishing station,
for lines, hooks, and shells, have been dug up in differ-
ent parts of the town; but beyond the memory of man,
there have been no professional fishermen, propably they 
have removed to the village of Gourdon, which is a more
eligible situation for carrying on the business  Bervie has
been long famous, or rather infamous, for an illicit and ille-
gal trade in teas, spirits, tobacco, etc; but the ruinous and 
baneful trade of smuggling is now much on the decline,
being confined to the running.*  of a few hundred ankers of
spirits annually, and by a set of worthless desperadoes,
who do not belong to the town, but bring their goods to

dean of guild, treasurer, and 9 councillors, are annually elected, but not

but by themselves:  However, I believe self-election is not confined to 
Bervie alone, but is the universal practice of the scotch boroughs.  The 
trademen of this burgh have no regular corporations, of source they 
have no office-bearers as in other towns, but they have a small fund esta-
blished, by mutual consent, each member pays so much on entry, and 
quarterly.  This money is generally applied in purchasing meal, which 
they sell out to the members of their own society. Bervie is one of the 
burghs in the Aberdeen district, and accordingly votes, for a represen-
tative in parliament, by a delegate chosen by the town-council, and the 
election takes place in the burghs by rotation of Parliaments.
