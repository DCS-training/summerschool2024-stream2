Morton in this parish belonging to the family, as appears from the
Minutes of the Scotch Parliament, 14th March 1457-8 and from
an instrument there referred to.
   Mansion Houses.-Beginning at the east side of the parish, and
going westward, the mansion houses are, Linnburn, belonging to
Alexander Croil, Esq.; Hillhouse, Alexander Johnston, Esq.;
Meadowbank, the seat of Alexander Maconochie, Esq., and which
furnished to him, as it had done to his father, his official title while
he occupied the Bench, from which his has very recently retir-
ed; Ormiston Hill, Archibald Wilkie, Esq.; Calderhall, Stuart
Bayley Hare, Esq.
   Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers of more early
date are in a state of considerable mutilation, the effects obviously,
in no small degree, of neglect, and particularly of exposure to
damp. This is the more to be regretted, that they appear to
have been full in their entries and accurately kept, and some of
them are fine specimens of the handwriting of the period.
   The Kirknewton volume (before the union of the parishes) has
the earliest date, 1642. It contains the minutes of session, in-
cluding receipts and disbursements for the poor, and a register of
marriages, baptisms, and burials. The session record and the
register are begun severally at the opposite ends of the book, and
carried on till they meet. The last entry in this volume is in
1655. The next volume commences in 1663, and comes down
to 1688. In the third volume the first date is 1691, and the
latest 1720.
   The East Calder records begin at the same date as those of
Kirknewton, viz. 1642. From this period, down to the union of
the parishes in 1750, they are more or less defective.
