ny years in this place been deemed a very lucrative branch
of rural attention, is annually fed in this parish.  Wheat
and pease are not much sown, though the former generally

high cultivation.  The latter is rather an uncertain crop,
and depends much on the season.  Turnip are here a very
precarious crop, and seldom compensate the trouble, ex-

cultivation, will be best communicated to the Public in the
form of the following Table, next page.
