   The most valuable age by this table, is that of 2 years old,
whose expectations of life, is 5 6 1/2 years, which is exceedingly
high, and can only be applied to a country district in Scot-
land.
   The above table of the probabilities of life is a striking evi-
dence, that English or foreign tables of observations do not
correspond with Scottish lives;-seeing by these, the expectation
of infancy does not exceed 25, or at most 28 years, whereas
here, it wants but a trifle of 50.  And if the value of life,
were computed by the above table, at a given rate of interest,
the difference would also be considerable, which would still
increase, did the practice of inoculation every where prevail.
Hence, a table of equal decrements, constructed upon the sup-
position, that 91 was the utmost extent of human life, would
be better adapted to Scottish lives, than M. de Moivre's hypo-
thetis, wherein that extent is fixed at 86 years.
   It may be here observed, that if we had tables of observa-
tion, adapted to the several counties in Scotland, it would be
easy to find the number of inhabitants, from the amount of
births and burials.  Thus, where they are equal, either of
them multiplied by an infant's expectation, call it, for in-
stance, 40, will produce the population.  But where there is
a difference, which is generally the cage, the half of their
sum, multiplied by an infant's expectation, adapted to the
particular district, will give the number of the people.  It would
be very desirable therefore, to have extracts from the registers of
all the parishes in Scotland, where exact accounts are kept of
the ages of the deceased, for the purpose of drawing up com-
plete tables of the probabilities of lives, calculated for Scotland.
