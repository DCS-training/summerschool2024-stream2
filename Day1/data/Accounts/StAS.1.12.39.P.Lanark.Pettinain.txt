     Of Pettinain.

Church, School, Heritors, etc.-The church is said to have 
been built towards the end of the last century.  The date 1698 
is found on the bell-house.  The stipend consists of 80 bolls 
of meal, 21 of bear, and 7 L. money.  The Earl of Hyndford 
is patron.  The glebe contains about 8 acres, part of which 
is very good land.  The manse was built in 1711; but has 
been repaired at different times.-There is a good house for 
the school and schoolmaster, and a small garden.  His salary, 
including the annual produce of a mortification, is 9 L. 11 s. 8 d.
The number of scholars is about 30.-There are only three 
heritors, none of whom reside in the parish.  The far greater 
part of the lands belongs to the Earl of Hyndford. 

   Antiquities.-In the confines of the parish on the S., and
on the high moorish ground formerly mentioned, the vestiges 
of a large camp, or fortified station, are still very visible.  It 
contains about 6 acres, which form an irregular figure, ap-
proaching to that of a circular area.  The wall seems to have 
been very thick and high, and to have been composed chiefly 
of coarse stones, many of them a kind of flag, collected, pro-
bably, from the adjoining grounds; but there is no appear- 
ance of mortar or cement.  It is situated upon the side of a 
deep moss, within which, at a little distance, are the remains 
of a small fort, scarcely including a rood of ground, which has 
evidently been connected with the large one by a passage- 
made through the moss.  The figure of this small fortification 
is likewise round, and the wall of it has been built with the 
same kind of stones.  The large camp includes several springs 
of excellent water.  Some urns were found, under the ruins 
of the wall, a great many years ago, by some people that 
were digging out the larger stones, for the purpose of build- 
ing.  They were each of them enclosed within four coarse 
flag stones, set on edge, and covered with one laid flat.  The
