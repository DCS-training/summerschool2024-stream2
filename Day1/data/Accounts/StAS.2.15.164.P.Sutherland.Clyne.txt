    164                    SUTHERLANDSHIRE.

      Persons who are ignorant of the character of the Highlanders,
   and many who have never seen the country, have ventured to de-
   scribe them as indolent, idle, and unprofitable members of the
   community.  A more gross fallacy has never been uttered.  They
   are a quiet, sober, brave, and a moral race; attached and confid-
   ing while kindly and honestly dealt by; but reserved, stern, and
   unbending as their mountain rocks, wherever they. suspect injustice,
   or lose faith in the acts and professions of their superiors.   The
   extensive and perfect improvements on the estate of Sutherland
   bear evidence of their activity, industry, and confidence in their
   landlord, when their energies are properly directed.  Those who
   reside in the country can testify, that it is a rare occurrence to
   meet with an individual the worse of liquor, except occasionally at
   markets.  The naval and military annals of the nation record their
   bravery, where they have distinguished themselves in many a des-
   perate onset.  The faithful labours of our clergy have been bless-
   ed by Providence in rendering them pious and moral; and their
   character may be summed up in these few words,-that they fear
   God and honour the Queen.
