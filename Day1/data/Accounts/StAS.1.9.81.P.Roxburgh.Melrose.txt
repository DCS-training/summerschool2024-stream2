dington, then "Lord of the lordship, and bailie principal
of the regality of Melrose."  For several years past this
trade has, from a variety of causes, been very much upon
the decline.  If something does not occur to prevent it,
Melrose will in all probability soon lose the name and busi-
ness, (as they themselves express it), of manufacturing
these linens.  Its importance to this place, and its rapid
decline, will appear from the following statement taken
from the stampmaster's yearly abstract: From the 1st No-
vember 1754 to 1st November 1755, there were stamped
33,282 1/2 yards, valued at L. 2575:10: 11 1/4.  In the 10
succeeding years there was no great rise or fall in the quan-
tity and value of linens.  From November 1764 to No-
vember 1765, there were stamped 32,300 5/8 yards, value
L. 2495: 14: 9 1/4.  From November 1773 to November
1774, 20,789 3/4 yards, value L. 2051: 16: 7 1/4.  In the fol-
lowing 10 years, the quantity was so far down as 17,792
yards, value L. 1845: 12: 4 Sterling*.

*The following are the causes to which this decline has been as-
cribed. 1st, The attention of the trustees for manufactures, etc. has been
principally directed, of late, to the encouragement of the woollen manu-
facture through Scotland.  In Galashiels, and that part of this parish
which is contiguous to it, they have laid out a considerable sum in build-
ings and machinery; and the manufacturers there have drawn annually,
for several years, from L. 40 to L. 70 Sterling, in premiums.  This has
enabled them to give more to spinners, than the profits on linen can af-
ford, and has, of course, diminished the number of linen-spinners, and
spoiled their hands for that employment.  2d, Women-servants get so high
wages, and are so much employed in out-work, that a sufficient number
of them cannot be procured to spin linen-yarn, though the price of spin-
ning it has been considerably advanced.  About 10 years ago, the prices
were only, for spinning 4 hanks yarn from 1 pound of lint, 1 s. 2 d.; for
5 hanks, 1 s. 4 d.; for 6 hanks, 1 s. 8 d.; and for 7 hanks, 2 s.  The
present prices are, for 4 hanks, 1 s. 7 d.; for 5 hanks, 1 s. 8 d.; for
hanks, 2 s.; and for 7 hanks, 2 s. 2 d.:  Some spinners get for 7 hanks,
2 s. 4 d. 3dly.  Since the American war, the price of Dutch flax has great-
ly risen, and the land here is mostly unfit for raising any.
