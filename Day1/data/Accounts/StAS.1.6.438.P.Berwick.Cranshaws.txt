years preceding 1788, there was only one person upon the
poor's roll, and since that time there have been only two on
that list.

   Agriculture.-As the greatest part of the parish consists of
high hills, covered with heath or bent, the lands in general
are more adapted to the breeding of cattle and sheep than the 
raising of grain.  There are, however, on all the different farms,
a considerable quantity of arable ground, which is very for-
viceable to the tenants, as it supplies their families with corn,
and provides fodder for their cattle in winter.  The soil, being
light and dry, is suitable for raising of turnips and sown grass.
Of late the farmers have availed themselves of the advantages
arising from this kind of soil, and have already carried this
species of improvement to a considerable height.  Their prin-
cipal dependance being on cattle and sheep, renders the cul-
ture of turnips and sown grass an object of great importance;
not only as being the best food for these animals, but some-
times the only food that can be got for the sheep, for in se-
vere winters the snow is commonly so deep as to prevent their
getting any nourishment either from the grass or heath.  Be-
fore the introduction of the turnip husbandry, and the raising
of clover and rye-grass, the farmers were frequently obliged
in the winter season to drive their sheep into low country,
and purchase hay for them.  This was not only attended with
great inconvenience and expence, but sometimes also with the
loss of a considerable part of their slocks, owing to the difficul-
ty of driving them through the deep snow, and the weak and
reduced condition in which the animals generally were before
their owners had recourse to this expedient.
   The introduction of the use of lime as a manure has been
of great benefit to the arable grounds in the neighbourhood.
