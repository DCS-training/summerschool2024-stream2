Glen-Birse, in the year 1724, the first inhabitant went to reside, and cul-
tivate the ground there; now there are 120 acres and odds under cultiva-
tion yielding upwards of L. 60 rent.  There are 147 inhabitants.  Being
removed from the means of education, their children and young people,
in number 37, are in great want of a teacher.  In a neighbouring glen,

is equal to what it was 30 or 40 years ago; though, in many places, there
are fewer inhabitants, owing to the union of farms, etc.  Application has
been made lately to the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge, in
behalf of the above glens, that a teacher may be nominated for them,
and we trust the Society will lend a favourable ear to our petition.
