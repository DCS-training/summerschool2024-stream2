     Statistical Account

   In the year 1774, when Semple took a list of the popula-
tion for his History of Renfrewshire, there were, in the vil-
lage,

   From this statement, it appears, that the population of the
country part of the parish, has diminished 199, since the year
1774; but the population of the village has increased 400.
Increase upon the whole, 201.
   From 1774 to 1782, there was an increase in the village
of 180 looms, and 24 new houses.  The villages had not in-
creased much since that time, owing to the cotton mills e-
rected within a mile of Kilbarchan, on Mr Houston's estate,
in the parish of Paisley, which have attracted the population
to that quarter.
   The diminution of the country population, and increase
of the town, may be ascribed to the immense demand for
manufacturing labour, which took place soon after the con-
clusion of the American war.  Yet the country has not suf-
fered in its cultivation.  A greater proportion has indeed
been thrown into pasture, which, instead of being a loss, is an
advantage.
   One circumstance must strike every person, who peruses
our table of population, that the number of females in the
country, exceeds the males by 42, and, in the town, they ex-
ceed the males by 60.  This may perhaps be accounted for
by supposing that the farmer's keep more female servants
than males, for the management of their dairies, while their
younger sons are sent to towns, and trained to business.  In
the village, on the other hand, the bleachfields, and cotton
manufactories, which, have long prevailed, require more fe-
males than males.
