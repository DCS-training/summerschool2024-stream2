It was opened, in the centre, by the writer hereof, and found to contain hu-
man teeth found, and a great quantity of human bones much reduced, which
were mixed with charcoal, and lodged among loose earth, having under-
gone the fire, which contributes to the preservation both of the bones and
charcoal.  This is the grave of the 34ø Romans who fell.  The Britons lost
10,000.  I found burned bones also in a small tumulus adjacent.
Compare what has been above said with the words of Boethius the his-
torian.  "Romani ad Taum haud procul a Caledom‘ castio (Dunkelden)
consedere.  Tulinam, ne Romanis dedita, illis resugium foret, concre-
"marunt (Britanni).  Locum Inchtuthil nostia ‘etas vocat, conjuges et
"omnem rem pecuariam, in Grampium transtulerunt montem.  Facto
"confensu, eo devenere, ut immmenti hyeme, pr‘lns abstenerentur, et pro-
"hiberent, ne Pictorium agros, cis Taum, Romani occuparent.  Secundum
"h‘c Galdus (Scotorum Rex) Atholiam hycmavit, Pictus vero et Gildo
munitionibus, qu‘ turn in Horestra erant, haud procul a Tao, hyemem
"transfegere.  Sequente ‘state, Agricola ligneum pontem in castris fecit,
"eo Tao fluvio strato, universum Romanum exercitum transportatum, in
"campos, haud procul a Grampi montis radicibus deduxit, Perchut rei
"fama Pictorum copras, qui proximis villis et munitiombus hyemabant, ut
"Gildum periculi facerent certriorem.  Galdus, cum exercitu, Grampio
"monte superato, in vallem deveniens, Pictorium, Noruegorum, Danorium-
"que copus est adjunctus, loco haud procul a Romano exercitu diverto,
"Atrox pugna donee fera nox.  Multa prodigia in Albrone, antequam
"Galdus cure Romanis pugnam iniret.  Natum Tulin‘ monstrum."
"On the year following, he says, "Romani noctu Tulmam adrere, inde
"pontem, quem Tao, proximo anno, imposuerant, diruerunt,"
Concerning his authority he says, "Ex quibus hanc historiam collegi,
nostræ gentis peculiariter Veremundus Archidraconus S. Andrew, na-
tioned Hispanus, qui ab exordro historiam, usque ad Malcolmi III. tem-
pora cui opus dicavit, contexuit, (A.D. 1060); Turgotus, Campbellus,
"quos tres, ex Iona infula, ad nos comportandos curavimus."  And in
another place, "Veremundi rude vetustate historia, abunde omnia com-
plectens, qaem authorem sumus insequuti."
   It is unnecessary to observe on the above, that Boethms means that Agri-
cola fought Galgacus in the Stormont, near Inchtuthill, and the east bank
of the Tay.  It is a pity that Veremund should be lost.  His book may
perhaps yet exist in the library of Aberdeen College, of which Boethius
was Principal.  More respect is due to Boethius, as an historian, than is
commonly granted to him.  They are his facts, and not his prodigies, or
opinions of the day, by which we are to acquit or condemn an historian.
