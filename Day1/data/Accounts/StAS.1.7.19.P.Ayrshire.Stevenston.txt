   The yearly duty payable on the above, at 6 s. per boll, is
978 L. 12 s.  This, however, is the gross duty, some little dis-
count being allowed for sea waste, prompt payment, etc.  The
quantity made will increase from the additional salt-pan.  It
is chiefly disposed of by an inland sale, reaching to the skirts
of Renfrewshire and Clydesdale, till it meet the Borrowstoun-
ness salt from the east coast; which, for I know not what
reason, seems to be made cheaper than on this coast, and can
therefore bear the expence of a longer land carriage.  A
cargo of salt is sometimes shipped from Saltcoats to the coasts
of Galloway and Nithsdale, but never to Ireland; on the
contrary, over the whole west coast of Scotland, from Mull
to the Solway Frith, the Irish salt is smuggled in such quan-
tities as to be very prejudicial to the salt manufacturers and
to the revenue.  Considering the high price of coal in Ire-
land, it may seem strange that we should be rivalled and un-
dersold in an article so much connected with coal; but it is
to be accounted for from there circumstances; that the two
processes of making salt and burning lime are combined in
Ireland, and carried on with the same fuel, probably turf;
that their salt is almost free from any duty; and, above all,
they have the liberty of importing rack-salt from the English
mines without any duty, or with a very trifling one.  The
mineral-salt dissolved in sea-water makes their process easy
and cheap, an advantage from which the British manufacturer
is cut off entirely.  This grievance deserves the attention of
those who have it in their power to remove it; and the
means is very obvious, viz. the laying such a considerable
but equitable duty on the exportation of the English rock-
salt as would bring the prices of the Irish and British salt to
par:  For, though every indulgence ought to be given to the
filter kingdom which her situation requires, it seems rather
