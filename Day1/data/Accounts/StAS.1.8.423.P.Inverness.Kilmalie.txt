Lochelle, who has upwards of 6,000 acres under birch and fir, in-
termingled, and 4,000 acres more, under oak and other timber.
On the property of Capt. M'Lean of Ardgour, there are about
1,000 acres of firs, oak, and other species of trees.  These
woods, in many places, would be very valuable.  Here, how-
ever, they are not, being far from the shore, and the roads to
them extremely bad.  To purchase imported timber, therefore,
is found to be cheaper; at least, it is preferred.  The trees,
that grow naturally, are oak, fir, birch, ash, mountain-ash,
holly, elm, wild geen, hazle, and the Scotch poplar.  Those
planted are, larix, spruce, silver fir, beech, plane, and fruit 
trees,

   Wild Quadrupeds and Birds.-The quadrupeds are, deer
and roes,-hares, as large as those in the low countries of Scot-
land, but not so swift,-weasels, polecats, badgers, and foxes,
of two kinds:  these last, are mostly extirpated, since the in-
troduction of sheep.-The birds are, eagles, of three different
kinds, hawks, kites, ravens, crows, and rooks.  There are
heathcocks, ptarmachans, and partridges; but they are de-
creasing annually, as their eggs are trampled upon, and broke
by the sheep.  There are also snipes, and plovers, with all
sorts of poultry; and a great variety of small birds, of the mu-
sical kind, such as the rose, the heath, and the rock-linnet,-
the chaff, the bull, and the goldfinch,-the sky-lark, the
thrush, the robin-redbreast, etc.-The migratory birds are,
woodcocks, which appear in October, and go away in March,-
and cuckoos, swallows, martins, swifts, and stonechatters,
which arrive in April, and depart in August, September, and
October.

   Cattle.-At present, there are in the parish, according to
the exactest calculation that could be made, about 6,000 head
