improvement calculated to elevate the condition or to augment
the comforts of his tenantry.  The school-room, though built about
thirty years ago, is yet superior to any other in any country parish
in the county.  It is well lighted, sufficiently large, and fitted up
in a very neat and substantial manner.

For the decrease of population from 1775 to 1793, the writer is
not furnished with the means of assigning any adequate cause.
The increase from 1793 to 1801 is accounted for by an influx of
strangers employed in cutting the canal, which was in progress
during the later part of that period, and that from 1801 to 1811
by the number of labourers from other parishes being engaged in
making the turnpike road.  The decrease fron) 1811 to 1821
was doubtless owing to a bleachfield having been given up during
the interim, and that from 1821 to 1831 may be traced for its
cause to a deficiency of employment in ditching and other agri-
cultural improvements-the tenants being less able to lay out
money for that purpose, and also to the circumstance of several of
the farms having fallen into the occupancy of bachelors.

   Language, &c.-The dialect spoken here is the common patois of
the district called broad Buchan.  It has been losing, during the
last forty years, much of its provincial peculiarity, and assimilating
itself more and more in phraseology, at least, to the English
tongue.  Many of the words and forms of expression used by very
old people are scarcely intelligible to the rising generation.
