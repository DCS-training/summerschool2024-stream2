subsoil is clayey. The only frequented, harbour is Annan Water-
foot which is completely sheltered from the winds of the west and
south-west by Barnkirk hill.
	Meteorology.--The temperature of the atmosphere is in gene-
ral remarkably mild. In winter, the mercury on Fahrenheit's scale
seldom falls below 35&deg;, while commonly it is not observed so low
by some degrees. In summer the mean heat ranges between 55'
and 65&deg;. Last rummer the mercury, in the shade, rose so high
as 80&deg;.
	The following table exhibits the average direction of the winds
for three years previous to November 1834:

	Although the rain  which falls here is considerable, the climate
is remarkable for its salubrity.
    Hydrography.--Rolling over a vast tract of sand in sand-banks,
which, during the absence of the tide are exposed, the water of the
Solway Frith possesses naturally in summer a higher, and in winter
a lower ddgree of temperature than the water of the ocean; and
from the amazing rapidity with which it flows, it loses much of the
