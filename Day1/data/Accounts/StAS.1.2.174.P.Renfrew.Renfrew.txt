after potatoes.  Such a rotation requires a good soil, potatoes
being a much severer crop than most people are aware of.
It is a certain fact, that wheat, produced from fallow ground.
will always bring a better price, than wheat after pota-
toes*.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church was built in 1726.  It is
not very well constructed, nor is it sufficient to contain the
inhabitants of the parish.-The king is patron.-
The stipend consists of 12 chalders of meal, payed in money
by the college of Glasgow, according to the fiars of the Com-
missariot of Hamilton and Campsie.  The glebe is about four
acres; and the whole living amounts to about L. 150 per an-

   Poor.-In consequence of an unfortunate misunderstand-
ing, between the late incumbent and the heritors, the former
threw up all connexion with the management of the poor, and
the latter chose a treasurer of their own; and in this state matters

*There is no part of Scots agriculture more difficult to deter-
mine, than what crop should precede wheat.  Fallow ought if
possible to be avoided,as it is losing a year.  Wheat after tur-
nips (unless spring wheat) is liable to the same objection, at least,
if the turnips are suffered to come to perfection.  The crop of po-
tatoes being ready for gathering, when the wheat ought to be sown,
is a strong temptations to make the one follow the other; but po-
tatoes, instead of enriching, rather exhaust the soil, and make
the ground too loose and open, which endangers the crop of wheat
during the frosts.  Oats,-barley,-clover,-wheat, would per-
haps be the best rotation where the ground was rich enough for
it.
