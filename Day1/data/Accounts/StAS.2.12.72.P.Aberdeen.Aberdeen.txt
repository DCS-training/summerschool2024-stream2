gaged to a considerable extent in chain-making; and five or six of
the firms. are employed in boiler-making.
   The number of men employed in this trade may be about 1000.
It is difficult to state the average rate of wages with any degree
of confidence; perhaps it may be from 18s. to L. 1, 5s. weekly;
and the annual amount of wages paid is probably not under
L. 50,000.
   Paper-making.-The first paper-mill in this neighbourhood was
erected at Peterculter about the year 1770.  Others were sub-
sequently set agoing in other situations; and there are now four
in the vicinity of Aberdeen, viz. at Peterculter, belonging to
Messrs Arbuthnot and M'Combie; at Mugiemoss, Charles Da-
vidson and Sons; at Waterton, Thomas Jaffray; and at Stony-
wood, Messrs Alexander Pirie and Sons.  Of these, the three
first make only coarse paper; the last makes writing and printing
papers.
   The power employed to drive these mills is altogether by water,
and cannot be reckoned at less than 250 horses' power, and the
number of persons directly occupied in the manufacture may be
from 300 to 400.  Within the last five years, the quantity manu-
factured has been doubled, and there is a prospect of a still increas-
ing production.  The material for the coarse papers (consisting of
rags, ropes, and mill waste,) is mostly collected in this and the
neigbbouring counties.  For the finer kinds the chief supply is from
abroad, though considerable quantities of rags are collected here.
By the last returns of the Excise from which we can derive
local information, the duty upon the paper manufactured in the
neighbourhood of Aberdeen was, for the year ending 5th January
1835,

   We have no certain ground to go upon in regard to the quan-
tity produced last year; but it is probable that the duty paid at
the equalized rate of 1 1/2d. per lb. amounted to nearly, if not fully,
L. 12,000.
   Rope and Twine-making.-There are in Aberdeen eight rope-
making works of considerable extent, besides several small ones;
and of these, three are chiefly employed in the manufacture of
cordage for ships, the others being principally engaged in rope-
