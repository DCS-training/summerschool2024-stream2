and parochine of Dalserf."  It appears from the above list of heri-
tors, that in 1721, nearly all the land in the parish was possessed
by Hamiltons.  Though the principal names and designations re-
main the same, the state of property has been much altered and
modified since the above period.  The Hamiltons of Cander and
Broomhill have entirely disappeared.
   The first Lord Belhaven was of this parish, being eldest son of
Sir James Hamilton of Broomhill.  His first designation was Sir
John Hamilton of Beil.  On account of his devoted attachment
to the cause of Charles I., he was, by that unfortunate monarch,
crdated a peer by the title of Lord Belhaven and Stentoun, 15th
December 1647.  His Lordship's next brother James, was ordain-
ed minister of Cambusnethan by Patrick Lindsay, Archbishop of
Glasgow in 1635, and in 1661 was promoted to the bishopric of
Galloway.  The bishop seems to have acquired the lands of Broom-
hill from his elder brother, Lord Belhaven, and spent much of his
time at the family mansion.  He had two sons, both of whom died
without issue, and the estate came into the possession of his
daughter Jean, married to Mr John Birnie of that ilk.  Broom-
hill remained in the possession of the Birnies till little more than
twenty years ago, when, upon the death of the last direct descend-
ant, a lady, the estate was sold by her heir to James Bruce, Esq.
a native of the parish, who had returned with a fortune from India.
   The following is a copy of the valuation of the parish, showing,
along with the names of the present heritors, the sum at which
each property is rated in the county cess-book:
