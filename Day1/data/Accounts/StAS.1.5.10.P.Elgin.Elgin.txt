mode is now generally adopted, and, within these 12 years,
2 oxen in traces, are also used by several farmers, and in
the light soils, with success.  For this reason, and as the
pasture is improved by artificial grasses, and green food
being occasionally given them in winter, the breed of
black cattle has been greatly improved, though in the coun-
try at large, the numbers on the whole are diminished.
L. 12 Sterling is often paid for an ox raised in this neigh-
bourhood, and above L. 20 has been given for a fatted ox.
Farmers, however, prefer in general, horses for the plough,
particularly when they are bred on their own farms, which
is done by many.  The style of farming utensils is greatly
improved, in regard to ploughs, as well as carts and wag-
gons.  Two-horse carts are coming into use.  The average
rent of the Scotch acre of arable land, in the immediate vi-
cinity of the town, is from L. 1, 10 s. to L. 2 Sterling, and
in the country part of the parish, it is from 15 s. to 18 s.
Sterling ; but this varies, as a great proportion, perhaps too
great, of the rents, is paid in bear and oats.  Rents are ad-
vancing daily.  The price of labour is amazingly raised
within the last 30 years.  Then a plowman had from 40 s.
to 50 s. a-year ; and now they receive from L. 5 to L. 7
Sterling, and other servants are paid in the same proportion.
There is no such thing as services exacted by any of the
proprietors, in this parish.
   The most considerable heritor is Lord Fife, next the Earl
of Moray, etc.  There are great numbers of proprietors, in
the immediate vicinity of the town, who have only small
pieces of land belonging to them, and, in general, most im-
properly separated, and detached ; so that they cannot culti-
vate their grounds, to the same advantage, as if they were 
more contiguous to each other.  From this cause, there are
but few inclosures or hedges about the place.
