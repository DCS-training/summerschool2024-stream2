perly finished, they will be of singular advantage, not only to
the parish of Kirkpatrick-Durham, but also to the county at
large;-as, in travelling from Kirkcudbright to Edinburgh,
the road over the moor, will br at least 12 miles shorter, than
that which goes by Dumfries and Moffat;-nad farther, as it
will open up an easy and beneficial communication, betwixt
the lower part of the stewartry of Kirkcudbrigh, and the up-
per part of the shire of Nithsdale, by which corn and meal
may be conceniently taken, from the stewartry, to Sanquhar,
and the country around it;-and coals from Sanquhar, and
limestone from Closeburn, or Barjarg, may be brought into
the stewartry.  This country is evidently only in the infancy
of improvement; but a little attention and expense, properly
applied, might soon bring it into a situation, equally advantage-
ous to the interests of society, and honourable to those, whose
public spirit induces them, by encouraging the exertions, and
rewarding the industry of their countrymen, to promote the
general benefit of the community.

   Import and Export.-The articles generally exported from
the parish, not including sheep, horses, or black cattle, which,
at the proper seasons, are sent to different markets, are oats,
barley, oat-meal, potatoes and wool.  The articles imported
into the parish, are lime, coals, stone-ware, and those goods
of all kinds which are retaile by the shop-keepers.

   Fuel.-The gentlemen, who reside in the parish, generally
burn coals, which they get from Sanquhar, Dalmellington,
or Whitehaven.  The smiths get the coals, necessary for the
purpose of the sorge, from Sanquhar, or Dalmellington.  The 
other inhabitants use peats; of which there is such great a-
bundance in Kirkpatrick-Durham, that the neighbouring pa-
rishes of Urr and Crossmichael, receive considerable supplies
