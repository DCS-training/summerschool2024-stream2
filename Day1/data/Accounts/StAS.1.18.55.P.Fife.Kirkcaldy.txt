over land, on the backs, sometimes of horses, but more com-
monly of women.  In this way, most kinds of fish that are
caught in the Frith, are pretty regularly brought to Kirkaldy
in their seasons, haddocks excepted; which have for several
years, been extremely rare, and have been sold at enormous
prices.  A shilling has been paid for a single haddock, that 15
years ago would have sold for a halfpenny.
   The vicinity of Edinburgh has an effect also on the prices
of eggs, poultry, and butter.  Eggs sell from 4 d. to 7 d. the
dozen, hens from 1 s. to 1 s 6 d. each, chickens from 8 d. to
1 s 4 d. the pair, butter from 8 d. to 11 d. the pound, green
cheese made of skimmed milk, from 2 d. to 3 d. the pound*.
All these articles, (together with the yarn that is spun in the
neighbourhood with the hand), are regularly exposed to sale,
in the weekly market, which holds here on Saturday, and
has this peculiarity, that it begins between 3 and 4 o'clock in
the morning, and is generally over by 6 o'clock.  This cus-
tom was probably introduced at first, to evade the law which
prohibits Saturday and Monday markets+.  And the conve-
nience of attending the market in the morning, and returning
home in time for the ordinary labour of the day, has induced
the country people to continue the custom, notwithstanding
that frequent attempts have been made to alter it.  By the
Charter of Charles, the Burgh had the privilege of holding
two annual fairs; one on the third Wednesday of July, ano-
ther on the last Wednesday of September.  For a long time,
these were regularly kept; but a, the constant trade of the
place advanced, the fairs gradually diminished; and for
many years, there has not been a vestige of them.
