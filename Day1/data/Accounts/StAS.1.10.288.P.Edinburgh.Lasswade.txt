at Hawthornden on the 13th of February 1585.  The parti-
culars of his life are so well known, that it is unnecessary to
enter into a detail of them in this place.  His works, consider-
ing the period when they were composed, do honour to him-
self and his country: They discover a mind highly cultivated,
and of a refined and elegant cast.  His company was much
courted by his cotemporaries.  Ben Johnson came from Lon-
don on foot, on purpose to pass some weeks with him at Haw-
thornden, and some fragments of their conversations are to
be found in his works.  He was zealously attached to the
cause of Charles I. and it is said, that the unhappy fate of
that monarch hastened on his own death, which happened on
the 4th of December 1649.  He was buried in his family
aile in the church of Laswade.
