parishes.  About 50 years ago, there were 16 small far-
mers in the village of Makerston, where now there is not
one.  It contains only 12 old cottages.  There were for-
merly about 24 farmers in this parish, with their families
and servants, where we can now reckon only nine.  I pre-
sume, that the number of inhabitants must then have exceed-
ed 1000. where I can hardly find above one fourth of that
number, viz. 250 or 255.  Of these, there is nearly an
equal number of males and females, about 60 under 10
years of age, and 10 or 12 between 10 and 20. All the rest
are between 20 and 70 years.  The total number of births,
for these six last years, is 76.  The marriages are only 18 in
that space.  In Dr Webster's report the number of souls
is stated at 165.

   Church.-The value of the living, including the glebe,
may be, as victual now sells, about L. 100; one half is paid
in money.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is no map of the parish,
but it is supposed to contain about 3300 acres, which yield
in rent about L. 1700 or L. 1800.  Of these, perhaps 600 or
700 may be in pasture, on which above 1000 sheep are fed;
and 160 or 180 black cattle are fed for the butcher, and
for family use.  There are 60 horses for plough, cart, and
saddle; besides one chaise and two wagons.  The farms are
laboured by 18 ploughs, and as many carts carry the corn to
market, and bring home the coals; which are the only fuel
used, except some cuttings of wood, and a few whins.
There is no moss, and there are not five acres in the whole
parish, of moor land.  Wheat, barley, oats, pease, turnips,
and potatoes, are the produce of the land.  All the coals
and lime, used here, are brought from Northumberland,
