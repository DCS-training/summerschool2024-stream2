   Soil, Manure, and Rent.-The soils of the parish are vari-
ous.  The haughs, or vallies, are compounded of loam, gravel
and sand, in different proportions.  On rising grounds between
the vallies and hills, there is loam, with here and there a
mixture of gravel.  On the hills, the soil varies accord-
ing to situation, being in some places light and dry; in
others soft and spungy; and in others wet and stiff.  In some
farms, there are moss and heath, though in small quantities.
The soil of the vallies, and of the rising grounds contiguous
to them, though not deep, is far from being unfertile; for,
under proper culture, it produces plentiful crops of oats, bar-
ley, turnips, potatoes, clover, and rye-grass: and, when laid
into grass, in proper condition, affords excellent pasture for
small cattle and sheep.  The soil of the hills is perfectly a-
dapted to the breeding of sheep.-The quantity of arable land
is inconsiderable, compared with that which is suitable for
pasture only.-The manure chiefly used is dung, collected in
the town, and at the different farms.  There is also marle in
different parts of the parish, which is used successfuly on land
in pasture, as well as in tillage.  Its effects have not been tried,
upon land appropriated to the breeding of sheep; some ima-
gining there would, and others there would not, be danger
in using it upon land light and dry.-The valued rent of the
parish is 11,591 L. 11 s. Scotch; the real rent about 2800 L.
Sterling.

   Trees and Sheep.-This parish does not produce any veget-
able or trees, but such as are to be found in other parts of
Scotland.  Upon the banks of rivers and rivulets, and upon
the sides of hills, the hazel, birch, hawthorn and grey willow,
spring spontaneously, when defended from the sheep; a proof
that, at a former period, the country has been more covered
with wood than at present.  Neither does the parish produce
