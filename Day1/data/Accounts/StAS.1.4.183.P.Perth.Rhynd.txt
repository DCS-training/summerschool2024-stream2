pretty extensive building.  The lands at that time are said 
to have belonged to the monastery of Duntermline. 
There is a tradition, that, in some very remote period,
the river Tay had its course on the north side of the Carse 
of Gowrie, by the foot of the hills:  That so long as the 
river kept this channel, St Madois and this were one pa-
rish:  That after the Tay took its present course, by the 
west end of the Carse, the people still continued to cross 
the river in boats to the church, which, the tradition says,
stood at theat time farther down, and nearer to the point 
where the rivers Tay and Earn meet; until one Sunday,
the boat was overlet in a storm, and all the people in it 
perished; That in consequence of this, St Madois was c-
rected into a parish by itself; and the church of Rynd re-
moved farther up, to the place where it now stands.  In 
confirmation of, at least, one part of the story, two known
facts are alledged, viz. that a field in the farm of Easter 
Rynd, before it was inclosed, and put into its presents form,
was called the Kirkland; and that in tilling this field, some 
freestones, that seemed to have been used in building, had 
been turned up by the plough.  There is certainly not a 
stone of any kind to be found in all the low flat ground 
that lies between the rivers and the foot of the east end of 
the Hill of Moncrieff, the whole being one continued mass,
of clay, for about 30 feet deep, intermixed with many
strata of sand, of different thicknesses, and in several places
with beds of hard moss, which the rivers sometimes wash
down from their banks, and which the common people 
use for fuel.
With respect to farmers, it is manifest that the employ-
ing cottager servants, and the employing unmarried house 
servants, have each their peculiar advantages and disad-
vantages; and it is hard to say, which of them ought to
