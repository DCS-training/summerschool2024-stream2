The reason of this was probably the common one; that the
whole property of the family of Grandtully, might be kept in
the county where the chief part of their estate was situated.
The old Earls of Tullibardine had a family seat at Blairin-
gone, on the north west side of the southern branch of Fossa-

   On the lands of Aldie, there is a rising ground called Car-

building, perfectly circular, and nearly 24 feet diameter.
Not long ago, the proprietor ordered this ground to be plant-

times of feudal aristocracy, strongly supported the chieftain
of the Murrays.  The barony of Aldie received its name
