     PARISH OF BALLANTRAE.

     Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Ballantrae is situated in the extremity of
the country of Ayr, towards the south*, and marches
with the shire of Wigton on the south and south-east.  It is
nearly ten miles square.  It is bounded on the north and
north-east by the parish of Colmonell; on the south and
south-east by the parishes of New Luce and Inch, in the shire
of Wigton; and by the sea on the west and south-west, hav-
ing an extent of more than ten miles of sea coast.  The
shore, excepting for about two miles opposite to the village

<FOOTNOTE>

*Both the parish of Ballantrae, and the neighbouring pa-
rish of Colmonell, were originally connected with the presbyte-
ry of Ayr, and synod of Glasgow and Ayr; but were disjoined
a little time after the Revolution, on account of their great dis-
tance from the seat of Presbytery, and annexed to the presbyte-
ry of Stranraer and synod of Galloway.  The parish takes its
name from the village of Ballantrae, which is evidently of Gae-
lic original, and signifies, in that language, the town upon or
above the shore; alluding to its situation on a gentle ascent im-
mediately from the shore:  And this may be the reason why,
though only a village, it always obtains the name of the "town
" of Ballantrae," while other villages through the country, not
in similar situations, are generally called Clachans.
