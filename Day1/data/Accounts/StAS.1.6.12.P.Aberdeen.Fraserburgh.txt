would exceed L. 300.-Fishing banks, for cod, commence
right off Kinnaird's-head, about 10 leagues out at sea; and
the herring shoals pass every year close under the coast.
Fraserburgh, therefore, would be an excellent station for ves-
sels and men employed in these fisheries.  The country adja-
cent is populous, and provisions are plentiful.-It has been
long in agitation to amend and enlarge this harbour, but the
want of money has hitherto prevented it.  The town's people
would chearfully contribute such a proportion as they can af-
ford, if they had hopes of obtaining assistance from Govern-
ment, the royal burghs, or elsewhere.
   Fraserburgh is a burgh of regality.  The government of it
is vested in Lord Saltoun, (the superior), two baillies, a dean
a guild, a treasurer, and a council.  His Lordship has the
right and authority of provost, with powers to nominate and
appoint yearly the new magistrates and council, by the advice
and consent of the old.  By the charter of erection, the feuars
are constituted burgesses of the burgh, and incorporated bre-
thren of the guild thereof.  Those admitted to its liberties may
exercise all kinds of trade and merchandize:  Such as are not
freemen may be debarred from a participation of that privi-
lege.  A power, however, which is not enforced.-The 
feuars are obliged to uphold the public works of the town.
But for doing this, the customs of the markets, and the har-
bour dues, were granted to them.  These may amount an-
nually to L. 60, and are under the management of the supe-
rior and council.-By a late transaction between Lord Sal-
toun and the town, the feuars, in lieu of some privileges and
claims over commonable lands, which they gave up, obtain-
ed, in property, lands which rent at L. 23.  Of this the feu-
ars, at large, have the sole disposal.  And they have it now
under consideration, with this fund, to bring water in pipes,
into the town, for the use of the inhabitants.
