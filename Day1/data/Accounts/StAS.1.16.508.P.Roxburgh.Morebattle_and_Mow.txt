price, that a common servant can, by his whole income of
about L. 15 a-year, maintain his family, and at the same
time acquire as much money as is requisite to stock a large
farm.  He and his offspring, if they do not change their
profession, must remain for ever in a state of servitude,
poor, helpless, and despised.  It is happily otherwise in those
places, where there is a proper mixture of great and small
farms.  It frequently happens that a servant, by a few
years industry and economy, with a little assistance from a
friend, accumulates a sum that enables him to commence
farmer on a small scale.  In this new, but more advanced
situation, he exerts himself by every lawful means in his
power; he is spurred on by a laudable emulation; and, at
the expiration of his lease, is generally able to quit the
small and enter on a larger farm.  Taught by this gradual
progress through the various stages of his profession, he di-
rects with skill, he rules with moderation, and he manages
with economy.  Were the inhabitants, in some places of
the island, favoured with such opportunities of rising in the
line of their business, it is highly probable that the landed
interest would find their profit in diminishing the extent of
some of their farms.  That it was not alone the accumula-
tion of small into great farms that bettered the condition of
some districts, but in a great measure the happy change
that took place in the mode of husbandry and farming, is
a conjecture that may safely be ventured.  The time is,
perhaps, at no great distance, when proprietors of estates
will find it as much their interest to diminish, at least, some
of their farms, as they formerly, imagined they did by en-
larging them.
