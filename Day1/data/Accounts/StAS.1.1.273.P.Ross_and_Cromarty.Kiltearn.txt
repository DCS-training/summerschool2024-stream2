   Though no public register of the burials has been kept
here, yet, from memorandums kept by private persons, and
the best information we could obtain on the subject, there is
every reason to believe that the above is a correct statement
for the last seven years.

   Heritors, Rent, and Farms.-There are six heritors or pro-
prietors of land in this parish; and the two most consider-
able of them reside constantly in it; one resides occasionally;
and the remaining three live upon other parts of their pro-
perty.  About 60 years ago, there were more than twice the
present number of heritors; but these were chiefly cadets of
the family of Fowlis, who had at different periods derived
their possessions from that family; and, when those small he-
ritors were obliged to fell off their lands, they have reverted,
by purchase, to the original proprietors.  The valued rent of
the parish is L. 3149: 9: 6 Scots; the real rent about L. 1500
Sterling.  Formerly, the greatest part of the rent was paid
in victual; but a good deal of the victual is now converted.
