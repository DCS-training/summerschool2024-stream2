chiefly the Cart, swelled with a variety of rivulets, pursues
among them its course, till passing with many windings by
the house of Pollock, it enters near the bottom of Crockston
the Abbey parish of Paisley.

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-The soil is various; in some parts
light, in others heavy; but excepting a tract on the south side,
which is tilly and barren, it is in general fertile.  The lands are
well inclosed; and the face of the fields affords ample proof,
that the knowledge and the industry of the farmer have, during
the last twenty years, greatly increased.
   The mode of farming is similar to that which has been
described in the accounts of neighbouring parishes.  Pota-
toe farming seems to be particularly cultivated here, and to be
well understood.  Horse-hoeing is the method most com-
monly followed, and where the grounds are light and dry
is followed with great success.  Sir John Maxwell sold in
1793 some fields of potatoes at L. 12: 10 per acre, yet the
persons in the village who purchased them, after all expences
were deducted, had them at 4 1/2 per peck of the Renfrew
measure.  Dr Smith in his Wealth of Nations, strongly re-
commends the cultivation of potatoes as a cheap and health-
ful food.  The porters of London, he observes, are among
the strongest men in the world, and they being almost all of
the Irish nation, have been chiefly fed upon potatoes.  He
insists too, that they are equally conducive to good 1ooks,
and as examples, mentions the women of the same nation.  It
might be added, that no food is more universally acceptable
to the taste, or is capable of being used in a greater variety of
forms.  Might not the improvement of it be considerably
assisted by attending more to the kinds which should be culti-
