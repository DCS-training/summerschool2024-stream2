lations.  It is certainly highly prudent to weigh well a sub-
ject of such importance, which cannot be comprehended at
once, which embraces a great variety of circumstances, and
for the most part points to futurity for the return of the pre-
sent outlay.
   It is already mentioned, that the two great commodities
wanted are coal and lime.  The distance from Gartmore to
Stirling by the high road is 20 miles; and from Stirling to
the coal and lime works usually frequented, the average dis-
tance may be reckoned 2 miles; in all 22 miles to the peo-
ple of Gartmore.  The distance from Kilmahog to Stirling is
17 miles, besides the above 2 miles, making the land carriage
19 miles to the people of Kilmahog.  To the inhabitants of
Aberfoil, the upper parts of Callander, and of the parish of
Balquhidder, the distance to coal is upwards of 30 miles;
yet these people come so far as Bannockburn for fuel; and
even the people of Killin parish, and other parts of the
Highlands, still more remote, travel the same road for coals
to their lairds, while they themselves have to toil in casting
and preparing peats; and after all their labour, are literally
no better servcd than the rude natives of North America.
   Inland navigation would at once cure the evil.  The fol-
lowing state will shew the extent of the arable land in the
perishes described requiring lime, and the number of families
requiring coal.
