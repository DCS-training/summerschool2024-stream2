menced operations in 1809, the Glasgow Union Banking Company
in 1830, and the Western Bank in 1832. These banks, with the
exception of the Arms, Merchants, Thomson's, and Watson's,
still continue to do business in Glasgow. There are also in Glas-
gow a branch of the British Linen chartered bank, and fourteen
branches from provincial banks.
	Provident Bank.--A provident or savings bank was opened in
Glasgow on the 3d of July 1815, wherein deposits of 1s. and up-
wards are received, bearing interest at the rate of two and a-half
per cent., when the sum amounts to 12s. 8d., and has lain one month
in the bank. The following is a statement of the concerns of the
bank for 1834. It is open every day for deposits, and twice a-week
for payments.

	It is very gratifying to know, that, during nineteen years, the
working-classes in Glasgow have so managed their savings, as to
entitle them to L. 10,662, 18s. interest, which, but for, this insti-
tution, might have been laid out for purposes quite unavailing in
the hour of need. The country generally, and the industrious classes
particularly, lie under deep obligations to the Rev. Dr Duncan of
Ruthwell, the founder of the provident bank scheme.
	Post-office.--The arrangements of this office are not surpassed,
if indeed equalled, by any out of London. In 1806, when Mr
Bannatyne was appointed post-master, the establishment consisted
of a postmaster, 3 clerks, a stamper, and 6 letter-carriers; and
there were 4 penny post-offices attached to it for the delivery and
receipt of letters in the neighbouring district. Receiving-houses
in the town for letters to be taken to the post-office had been tried,
and had been given up on finding that they were not used. There
were two deliveries of letters made daily to every part of the town
and suburbs. The Glasgow establishment in 1835 consists of a
post-master, 10 clerks, 2 stampers, a superintendent ot letter-car-
riers, and 19 letter-carriers; and there are 26 penny post-offices,
and 9 sub-offices, attached to it, for the correspondence of that sur-
rounding district. It has 12 receiving-house distribute in the
different parts of the town, the letters put into which are carried
