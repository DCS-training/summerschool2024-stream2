     The Statistical Account.

   IN every country celebrated for the wisdom of its legisla-
tion, and the virtue of its inhabitants, the culture of youth,
you well know, has been considered as an object of the high-
est consequence, and has been provided for by the united ex-
ertions of abilities and care.  It would be an affront, to load
the page with quotations from the historian and philosopher,
or to mention examples of governments in ancient or mo-
dern times; since they are too obvious to be overlooked,
and too memorable to be forgotten.  Statesmen, by whose
salutary regulations the interests of knowledge and morality
have been promoted, and sovereigns, under whose softering
auspices they have flourished, now enjoy the reputation justly
due to their deserts.  Learning gratefully repays the favours
which she received; and with honours, superior, in the eyes
of judicious posperity, to those of heroes and of conquerors,
decorates the memory of her friends.  Such has seen the
meed assigned to the exertions of Lorenzo de Medicis and
Peter the Great; and such, in the future annals of mankind,
will be that of every minister or sovereign, who, like them,
shall devote his abilities to the true improvement of the coun-
try over which he presides.
   Of the excellence or propriety of any measure, the general
practice and approbation of the wife has justly been considered
as an almost unexceptionable proof.  But, let us not appeal
solely to the opinion of others, where we are fully enabled
ourselves to judge; nor refer to experience alone, where rea-
son also is competent to decide.  To you, Sir, and to all
who are versed in political science, the attentive culture of
youth must appear a strict consequence from the soundest
principles of that science.  It is the ultimate object of every
great legislator, to render his country powerful and happy.
To be powerful and happy, the people must be virtuous
and enlightened.  Virtue and knowledge are not the growth
