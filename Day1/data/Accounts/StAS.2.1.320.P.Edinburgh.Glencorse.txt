   The church had originally been a Popish place of worship, and
was made use of after the Reformation by the Presbyterians, be-
fore Presbytery was established. When the church was repaired
in 1811, there was found, in deepening the floor, about the middle
of it, a large quadrangular-shaped stone, 19 inches square and 21
inches deep, with a bead neatly cut round the edges and down the
corners to the base; and a circular font in the centre, 13 inches
in diameter and 8 inches deep, which no doubt had been used in
Popish times. On the opposite corners of the stone, pieces of
iron, broken off by the surface, remain fixed in with lead. In the
cavity of the stone, a skull and several bones were found.

Purves admitted by the Bishop and Moderator in 1674. Mr
John Fraser, ordained in 1691, and removed, to the great re-
gret of his parishioners, to Alness, in Ross-shire, in 1696, owing to

Gaelic. Church vacant till 1699, when Mr John Wilson was or-
dained, who died in 1757. Mr John Walker, ordained in Septem-

   It is stated in another place, that "in the year sixteen hundred and ninetie-nine,
the church was rebuilt again." What is rather remarkable, there was insertions of the
weekly collections, except what took place in consequence of the vacancy that occur-
red the following year in October 1696, when Mr John Fraser was removed to Al-
neu. After that, there was sermon only once a month, and sometimes only once
in three months, till October 1699, when Mr John Wilson was ordained minister of
the parish.
