   Language.-The common idiom of this country, is a dia-
lect of the ancient Celtic, which in remote ages pervaded the
southern and western regions of Europe; and together with
the Gothic, divided this quarter of the globe into two radi-
cal and distinct languages.  Though the latter, owing to the
better fortune of the people who spoke it, has prevailed over
the former, yet may a considerable portion of the roots of
several modern languages be traced to a Celtic original.  This,
however, is not the place for such discussions.  The dialect
spoken in this country is growing daily more corrupted, by
the admission of Anglicisms, and a number of terms unknown
to the simple arts of the ancient Highlanders.  Such is the
folly or bad taste of the people, that they gratify a preposter-
ous vanity from this kind of innovation.  It may therefore
be well supposed, that the language is upon the decline; that
the harmony of its cadence is gradually changing, and the
purity of its structure mixing with foreign idioms.  The
young people speak Gaelic and English indifferently, and
with equal impropriety.  Their uncouth articulation of dis-
cordant words and jarring sounds, resembles the musick of 
frogs in a Dutch canal, harsh and disgusting to the Attic ear
of a genuine Highlander.  Some of the old people speak the
Gaelic, and consequently with a degree of propriety.  On
subjects of common accurrence, they are at no loss for ex-
pression in well chosen and natural language.  Hence, it may
be inferred, that the parish of Kirkmichael spoke the same
dialect of the Celtic that is now spoken in Badenoch, making
allowance for some little difference, in point of pronunciaton.
