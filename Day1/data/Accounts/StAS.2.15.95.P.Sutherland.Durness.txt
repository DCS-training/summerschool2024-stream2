Several neat cottages, however, built with lime or clay, are com-
mensed in those hamlets where the lots are divided.

                     III.-POPULATION.

   By a census taken in 1724, the population did not exceed 1000
souls.  In 1790 the population was 1182.  In the Durness, or
second district of the parish there has been an increase of nearly 50
per cent since 1815; but in the third or eastern district, Eriboll,
the population has diminished since 1815 from 517 to 220.  The
decrease has been owing to the whole district having been con-
verted into two extensive sheep-farms. The increase in the Dur-
ness, or second division, har been owing to the establishment of
the herring fishery, and the subdivision of lots in the different ham-
lets.  In 1815 from thirty to forty families emigrated to America.

ly in their dispositions, social in their habits, and when engag-
ed in their, either at sea or on land, endure a good deal of fatigue.
There are few artisans among them: and, having little or nothing
to do in the winter months, many of them are in the habit of vi-
siting and spending the evenings in each other's houses in the dif-
ferent hamblets, bearing the news of the country, repeating the
songs of their native bard, or listening to the legendary tales of
some venerable Senachie.
