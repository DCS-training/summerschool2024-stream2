stone and gravel-banks but the granite reappears on the north
sideaof the burn of Rosemarkie, and thernce composes several of
the hills and cliffs along the coast, till, at the Sutors of Cromarty,
it is found completely disencumbered of the secondary deposits,
The rock, especially at its western boundary, consists chiefly of
a hard, small granular and flesh-coloured granite, through which
are interspersed in minute grains and coatings, crystals of black
iron ore and lead glance. Numerous and large masses of gneiss
also occur intermixed with beds of hornblende, actynolite slate
and quartz rcck, among which garnets are extensivdly disseminate
ed; while the whole are everywhere charged with granite veins.
The intrusion of sucb granitic invasion among the sandstone strata
could not fail to have greatly affected them, and accordingly, on
the estates of Avoch and Rosehaugh, the ridge of which seems to
have been over a centre of volcanic action, we find the soft new
red sandstone upheaved into short perpendicular hardened masses,
the alteration and dislocation of the previously horizontal strata
being seen to extend from the base to the very summit and crest
of the ridge. On the opposite sides of the hill, the strata are seen
thrown off in opposite directions, and even in the plains of Suddy
the layers of the red sandstone are so irregularly disposed, and
so often broken and disturbed, that it would be as useless as te-
dious to attempt to lay down with any degree of precision, the bear-
ings or dip of the rocks. This confusion is worthy of notice, only
as demonstrative of the greatness and extent of the granitic influ-
ence. That rock itself, with its various beds, falls to be more mi-
mutely described in the reports of the parishes of Rosemarkie and
Cromarty. It is proper to add, however, that the great elevation
of the Milbuy sandstones has been most probably occasioned by
the same subterranean action, although we have not as yet seen
the grantitic rock cropping out on the surface; and in this view, it
is likely that the basin of the Cromarty Frith was formed on the
upheaving of the sandstone  ridges along its sides, and that, before
the invasion of the sea from between the Sutors, it consisted of a
series of inland lakes or hollows.
   Gravel.-The whole of the parish of Avoch is, like the neigh-
bouring districts, strewn over with great beds of sand and gravel,
transported from a distance, as well as resulting from the decom-
posed materials of its own rocks.  In the eastern part of the pa-
rish, towards Raddery, the gravel beds increase in extent and
thickness, and on descending the course of the burn of Rosemar-
kie, which is situated nearly along the junction of the sandstone
