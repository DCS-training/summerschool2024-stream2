*There have been, in this century, three maps made of Aberdeen.  The
first by G. and W. Paterson in 1746, which is titled, "A Survey of Old
"and New Aberdeen, with the adjacent country between the rivers Dee
"and Don."  It makes a single meet map, mad is prefixed to No. III. of
Bibliotheca Typographica Britannica, 410.  The second, published in 1773,
by Captain Taylor, comprehends Old Aberdeen, and most of the parish of
Old Machar, with all the fields lying between Dee and Don, to about three
miles from the mouth.  The third, on a larger scale than either of the for-
mer, published in 1790, by Alexander Milne, is intended chiefly as a map
of the town and harbour of Aberdeen, with the nearest circumjcent fields,
