     Statistical Account

   Church and Poor.-The whole income of the minister,
consisting of the old money stipend, an augmentation ob-
tained in 1785, and payable in butter, ling, wool, and
lambs; a glebe of 12 merks of excellent land; an annuity
allowed, in consequence of an agreement by the heritors,
and three days work by the parishioners, may be estimated
at L. 108 Sterling a-year.  The manse is rather in a ruin-
ous condition, but the present minister preferred the annuity
above mentioned to a new manse.  The church, which was
built in 1764, and repaired in 1789, stands at a place call-
ed Balcasta, at the distance of 3 miles from the minister's
abode.  It should seem, that the ancient inhabitants of this
parish, if not more numerous, must have been, at least,
more religious than the present; for the remains of no
fewer than 24 chapels still subsist in the island.  So late as
1740, the clergyman was obliged to preach in three dif-
ferent in the island, at the ruins of as many old kirks*.
Sir Thomas Dundas is patron.-The number of poor de-
pendent on alms is generally from 25 to 30.  For their
support, the parish is divided into 14 parts, called quarters,
through which the whole poor are dispersed.  To each of
these a proportional number is assigned.  In every family,
within each quarter, the poor belonging to it receive their
board for as many days as the family occupies merks of
land; and after proceeding in this manner through the
whole families in that quarter, return upon the first again.

*There is no parochial school.  One reason against the establishment
of such as institution is, that the inhabitants are too widely scattered
through the island, to leave it possible for more than a very small propor-
tion of the children to attend a school in any particular situation.  But
a public school will probably be soon established here.
