     Statistical Account

   This Table gives the real state of the parish in the end of
the year 1792; and, since that time, there has been but little
alteration.

   Plantations, etc.-The plantations mentioned in the table are
exceedingly valuable, and add greatly to the beauty of this
part of the country.  All sorts of trees planted in Scotland are
to be seen in them; and several sorts in great numbers, and
in the most flourishing state.  To say nothing of the more
common species, the number of fine oak, beech, spruce fir, and
sweet chesnut, is very considerable.  There are also a few ce-
dars, two of which are among the largest that are to be seen in
Scotland.
   Pennant says, that the ash does not flourish here; but he
must have been led to say this, through inadvertency or mis-
information; for there are such fine trees of that species, not
only in the pleasure ground and plantations of Duplin, but
in various parts of the estate, that the ash may be looked up-
on as the indigenous tree of the country.  The mention of
this mistake of Pennant's, naturally leads to the mention of
another, though it may be thought, perhaps, to be made a
little out of place.  Pennant says, that fruit will not ripen at
Duplin; and yet it is a certain fact, that peaches and necta-
rines come to great perfection there every year, on the com-
mon wall.
   The plantations in this parish are of different ages, a great
many of the trees having been planted in the end of the last,
and the beginning of this century, and a great many at diffe-
rent times since the year 1762.  Duplin castle, the Earl of
Kinnoul's principal seat, stands on the rising ground, and is
on all sides surrounded with the oldest and the finest of those
trees.  The rich and beautifully variegated prospect which it
commands, and the great extent of the adjacent plantations
