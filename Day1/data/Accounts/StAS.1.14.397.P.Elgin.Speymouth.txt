     Of Speymouth.

country, to a considerable distance on both sides of Spey;
and in regard to one common object, it may be stated
as the most important improvement that could be made
to all the extensive and populous counties W. and N.
of Spey, as well as to the counties of Banff and Aber-
deen to the S. and E.  It is of importance in a publick
view, as the judges must pass this way to and from the
circuit at Inverness, and the troops to and from Fort
George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William; and it is
an object of importance to every traveller that visits
this country.  The road that passes the river Spey at
the Boat of Bog in this parish, is, and from the situation
of the country ever must be, the only great post road,
and great line of communication from the S. to the
counties of Elgin, Nairn, Inverness, Ross, Cromarty,
Sutherland, Caithness, and Orkney.  Spey can very
seldom be forded with safety.  The boat here is in-
deed good, and well served.  But a passage by boat is
inconvenient at the best; and when a river, so great and
rapid as the Spey, is higher than ordinary, or, in a
flood, as is oft-times the case, it must be highly incon-
venient, and sometimes dangerous.  When the import-
ance of a bridge at this place to so considerable a part
of the kingdom is considered, it must naturally excite
surprise, that it has not long ago attracted effectually
the attention of the publick.  The internal improve-
ments of a country claim the first care of the publick;
and of these, roads and bridges, for facilitating commu-
nications, are held the most essential.  If so, then, a
bridge over the Spey, at the great post road, which is
so important an object to the whole of the North of
Scotland, has a high claim on the publick attention.
