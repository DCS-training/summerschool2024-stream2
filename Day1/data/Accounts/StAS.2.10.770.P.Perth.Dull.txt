                                 III.-POPULATION.


    According to Dr Webster, the population of the original parish
      in 1775 amounted to                                            4897
    By former Statistical report,                                    4670
    By Government census in 1811,       males, 2039, females, 2290 = 4329
                            1821,              2178           2330 = 4508
                            1831,              2225           2365 = 4590
                            1841,              1806           2004 = 3810
      The above decrease is mostly owing to emigration, arising from
    the enlargement of farms.
      Besides the village of Dull, containing about 150 inhabitants,
    there are several other small ones, varying in population from 50
    to 140, and in the aggregate amounting to 860; but the only vil-
    lage of any note is Aberfeldy, and in that portion of it which be-
    longs to this parish, there is a population of 610 by last census.
    The rest of the population residing in the country amount to
    2190.

      There are eight families of independent fortune resident within
    the parish, of whom three are heritors and proprietors of land of
    the yearly value of L.50 and upwards.
      Although almost all the people can both speak and understand
    the English language, still the generality of them have a decided
    predilection for the Gaelic. This appears from the fact that it
    is the ordinary medium of their daily intercourse, but it nowhere
    appears so evident as during public worship in church on the Sab-
    bath. While the common classes are apparently indifferent and
    unconcerned during the English service, they are all eyes and at-
    tention during the Gaelic, and hanging with anxiety, as it were,
    on the lips of the preacher, thus indicating that it is by means of
    their vernacular tongue the voice of instruction can principally
    reach them " savingly and to profit."
      The Highland garb, once the graceful costume of the peasantry,
    has fallen almost completely into desuetude; and their once po-
    pular games and prevalent superstitions have vanished before the
    fairy wand of civilization. They enjoy an ordinary share of the
    comforts of life, and are apparently happy and contented with their
