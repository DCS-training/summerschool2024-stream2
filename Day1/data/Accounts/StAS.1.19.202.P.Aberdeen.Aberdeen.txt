   Thread Manufacture.-In the article of thread, particu-
larly white and coloured pound threads, the Scotch stand
unrivalled, and they must maintain their superiority by
local advantages, which no other country at present can
possess, and the manufacture is carried on to an extent equal
to any demand.  Aberdeen exceeds in quantity that of any
other town in Scotland; and none have surpassed, if they
have yet come up to, their fabric in quality.  All the
threads made here are sent to the English market, and for
the greatest part direct to London, and from thence to
many different places abroad.  Besides pound thread there
is made here a considerable quantity of the finer threads,
called ounce or nun's thread, from their having been made
by nuns in France and Flanders before the manufacture
was introduced into this country.  The principal thread-
manufacturers in Aberdeen are, Milne, Cruden and Com-

Company, for stitching and coloured threads; and Young
and Walker, for coloured threads only.
   These, with several less extensive adventurers in the same
trade, and including a few who manufacture linen-yarn
only, employ nearly 100 boys under 14 years of age, who
earn each from 1 s. 8 d. to 2 s. 6 d. a-week; 600 men,
earning from 5 s. to 12 s. a-week each; and not under
2000 women, who have constant employment, mostly in
their own houses, in spinning yarn, doubling and twist-
ing thread, etc.  Many women, who work within the ma-
nufactures, will earn from 5 s. to 6 s. a-week; but those
who work in their own houses cannot earn nearly so much,
a considerable part of their time being taken up with fa-
mily matters, and other avocations.  But additional to the
