mode of husbandry, generally lime on the grass from
30 to 40 bolls of shells an acre, and which, they think,
will not admit of more lime for 20 or 30 years afterward.
At the same time, it must be observed, that most of the
outfield is now coming to be infield, from the superior
mode of management adopted by the farmers.  Some pre-

for barley, with grass-seeds, 3 years grass cut for hay 2
years, and pasture the 3 d; oats, barley, green crop, and so-

   Produce.-The soil here is remarkably fitted for barley,
and frequently produces large returns from the acre.  The
wheat, though of a good quality, seldom produces so much.
The oats are good, and have often been known to give 8
stone of meal the boll, Linlithgow measure.  The turnips
seldom fail to produce a heavy crop.  Pease and beans are
precarious, and cultivated chiefly with a view of preparing
the soil for the after crop.  Potatoes are good in quality,
and often give large returns from the acre.  Flax, especial-
ly in new-drained lands, a weighty crop.  The lands pro-

inhabitants.  Most of the wheat and barley is sent by the
Tay to the Forth and Canal, and the oats are sold in the
neighbourhood.  This parish, till within these 30 years,

cattle necessary for labouring the soil.  At that time the
farmers were forced to graze out a part, and depended
chiefly upon their marshy grounds for the subsistence of
the remainder through the summer.  Now the bogs are
