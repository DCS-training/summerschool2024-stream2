     PARISH OF NEWTYLE.

     (Country of Forfar.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER SMALL.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish was formerly written Newtyld, but is now
spelt Newtyle.  It is situated in the country of Forfar,
in the presbytery of Meigle, and synod of Angus and Mearns.
Its extent is about 1 3/4 miles in length, from east to west,
along the Sidlie Hills, on the east of the Glack of Newtyle,
(an opening in the Sidlie Hills, affording a passage from
Strathmore to Dundee); it is 1 3/4 miles from south to north,
over the Sidlie hills, and one mile broad; the remaining 3/4 of
a mile, along the hill, being pretty nigh square.

   Soil, Climate, and Diseases.-The country is hilly on the
south, and flat on the north.  The soil is a mixture of black
earth and clay; and, in some places, of sand and gravel.  In
general it is fertile and well cultivated.  Horses and cattle,
of a good size and value, are raised here.  There is but one
flock of sheep.  The air is dry and healthty, excepting in
some marshy places toward the north.  Slow fevers are fre-
quent here, and scrophulous complaints not rare; which last
are very severe in the spring.
