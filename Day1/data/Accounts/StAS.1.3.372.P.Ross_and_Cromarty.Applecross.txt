small and great, in the parish.  During the summer and har-
vest, they pasture upon the low grounds, which produces grass
of a finer and more nourishing quality, than is to be found
in any of Sky, or the other adjacent islands.  The cattle
are for the most part coupled, i.e. have but one calf between
every 2 cows; by these means the calf is better fed, a greater
quantity of butter and cheese is manufactured, the bulling se-
cured, and no tupersluous stock kept on hand.  Except in the
district of Kisthorn, the number of horses is very inconsider-
able.  The sheep are all the smallest kind; their mutton
is firm, fat, and juicy.  Goats are kept for private use; their
milk is the earliest supply to relieve the necessities of the indi-
gent; and pasturing, among rocks and precipices, inaccessible

cinal virtues.  The hills abound with deer; 30,40, or 50 is no
uncommon fight in a flock.  Roes, badgers, and otters, are
likewise to be found.  The kingsfisher, cuckow, water-
wagtail, swallow, and corncraick, are the migratory birds of
the parish.  There is some moor game; but the wetness of

so noxious to the hatched young, prevent their increate.

are to be got all along the coast of this parish; but not being
used for exportation, and having no ready market at hand,
they are only sought after, either to gratify the desire, or re-
lieve the necessities, of the present moment.  The herring
occasionally frequents all our bays, creeks, and harbours,
which are numerous, and being a favourite fish, not only for
exportation, but for home consumption, it is in all seasons
greedily pursued.  From the middle of July to the 11th of
September, it is in its greatest perfection; and from the begin-
ning of November to the 11th of December, though not so
