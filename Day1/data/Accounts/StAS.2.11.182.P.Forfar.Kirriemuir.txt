	Irrigation is practised in several parts of the parish, but espe-
cially at Logie, the residence of John Kinloch, Esq. of Kilry.
The enclosures are flooded by the Garie in November, and
are continued so till the beginning of April. These enclo-
sures have been in grass since 1770; and in consequence of
the above practice, says the Rev. Thomas Ogilvy in 1792,
"they are now the earliest and best grass fields in the country, and
there is not perhaps any in Scotland superior to them. Before
the above period," continues he, "they let at from 10s. to 12s. the
Scotch acre, but last season from 60s. to 90s. per acre." Mr Peat
adds, that in 1801 the rent had increased tn L. 5 Sterling per acre.
The first six or seven years of watering promised no great advan-
tage, but perseverance has increased their value ten times, and
that, too, at a trifling expense.
	In 1830, these fields, after being fifty years in grass, were let for
a course of cropping, some of them as high as L. 9, 5s. per Scotch
acre. Last season was wet, but some of the fields produced
14 bolls of 6 bushels per acre. The advantage of irrigation is
thus demonstrated not only in improving the grass, but also in
ameliorating the soil. I only add, farther, that grass fostered by
irrigation is found to be better adapted for cattle than for sheep.
	The general duration of leases is nineteen years. The state of
farm-houses is in general good. A considerable part ot the parish
is enclosed; partly with hedges, but chiefly with stone walls. The
greater part of the parish is in the hands of industrious tenants,
who follow the most approved methods of husbandry.
