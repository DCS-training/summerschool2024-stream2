tened, and their approaches improved; and thewhole of the pub-
lic roads have been reconstructed.
	The numbers of poor and their stated allowances have been in-
creased two-fold. There has been for many years little or no in-
door employment for aged females, a much earlier application for
parochial aid is therefore generally made by this class of persons
than would have been needful under other circumstances. At
the period of the former account it was estimated "that 500
spindles of coarse yarn, for the manufacture of sail-cloth, were
spun by the two-handed females of the parish, from which about
L. 310 a year were brought into the parish. There were besides
the proceeds from the manufacture of finer sorts of yarn for linen
and drapery for family use." There is no work of this kind now to
be obtained, and the want of it has been much felt by many whose
age and growing infirmities render them unfit for more severe em-
pioyment.
	A very obvious alteration has taken place in the habits and
style of living of the principal farmers. They have certainly ad-
vanced at a railroad pace in the march of, at least, physical im-
provement. On the other hand, the condition of the farm-labour-
er has remained nearly stationary, though be enjoys more enlarg-
ed means of education and intellectual improvement.
