small fish found a ready market in the Frith of Forth, and
the price of them formed a stock for the fishers to trade with
in Autumn.

   Causes of its Decline.-In this manner was the fishing suc-
cessfully carried on till the year 1743, when two of the boats
foundered at sea.  This was a severe stroke, and followed
by another, a few years after, equally destructive to the fish-
ing, though not so fatal to the crews.  As the boats were
returning from the sea in 1756, a tender intercepted 3 of
them, and impressed the stoutest of their men.  A demand
from government of every fifth man to serve on board the
fleet soon followed.  The fishers were obliged to comply with
the necessity of the times, by either going themselves, or
bribing others in their stead: and thus purchased protections
for those who remained, at a great expence.  Reduced in
men and money, they were unable, by the end of the war in
1763, to fit out more than 8 large boats, and as many small.
In 1768, they were harrassed by Press-gangs, and forced to
raise a new levy, at the rate of 10 L. or 12 L. a man.  Distres-
sed with so many demands, and deprived of the means of
supplying them, many stout young men abandoned the fish-
ing, and bound themselves apprentices to colliers, in order
to avoid serving on board the navy;-a service, from which
the impolitic, though sometimes necessary, measure of im-
pressing is calculated to create aversion.  The boats were now
poorly mann'd, and unable to go to sea, unless in very fa-
vourable weather.  Through the poverty of their owners,
they fell to pieces, one after another, till the year 1776,
when they were reduced to 5.  The commencement of a
new war created a new demand for men.  Tenders and
press-gangs persecuted them at sea and shore, and prevented
them from earning bread to their families.  It therefore be-
