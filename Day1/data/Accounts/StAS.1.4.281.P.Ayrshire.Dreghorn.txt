It is also mostly inclosed, and there are a variety of clumps
of planting upon the eminences of lunch lands, as are the pro-
perty of the Earl of Eglinton.  There is also a number of
verges of planting upon the estates of the other heritors, all
which have a very fine effect in beautifying the country.

   Agriculture.-The usual crops are oats, bear, and rye-
grass.  Besides these, there are some small quantities of
wheat raised, and two farmers in the parish have several
times sown a few acres of turnip.  There is very little
black victual sown.  The method of culture which has been
generally followed here for upwards of 30 years is the fol-
lowing.  Every farm is now divided into three parts, each
of these is ploughed for 3 years in its turn, while the
other 2 remain in grass.  Grass-seeds are sown with the
third year's crop, and the tenants is allowed to cut his hay
field for one season, and sometimes for two.  Mr Snodgrass
of Cuninghamhead has, for upwards of 12 years, differed
from this mode of culture.  He allows his tenants only to
plough one-fourth of their farms for 3 years.  by this me-
thod each fourth remains 9 years in grass, in place of 6, be-
fore it is ploughed up.  This he considers as being attend-
ed with two advantages to the tenant.  It lessens the num-
ber of his horses upon the farm, while the fourth that is
ploughed up, on account of its long rest, yields nearly as much
grain as the third used to do.  The pasture grounds are like-
wife very much improved for the same reason.  A further
advantage supposed to arise from this is, that when once the
lands are put in proper order, the tenant has it not in his
power to spoil them, if he was disposed to do so.  This plan
is a considered to far preferable to the other, that in all the
late leaves of the Earl of Eglinton's estate in his parish it
is adopted, where the farm is of a certain extent, as it is also
