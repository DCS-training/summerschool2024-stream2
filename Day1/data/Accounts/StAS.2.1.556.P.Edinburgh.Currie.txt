meal and potatoes from the family of Riccarton, help to make a
tolerable living to a single person.
   Within the last few years a neat and commodious school and
schoolhouse have been erected at Balerno, by means of a grant
of L. 100 obtained from the Government Board of Education, and
an equal sum raised by subscription. The school is under the
management of eight directors, half of them adhering to the
Establishment, and the other half being Dissenters.
   There are three Sabbath schools in the parish: one at Currie,
taught by the parish minister; a second under his superintendence
at Hermiston, taught by members of the Village Sabbath School
Society; and a third at Balerno, by the Rev. Andrew Tod.
   Library.-A parish library was founded by the writer, 1839,
which has been greatly enriched by donations in money and books
from the heritors and others, and which, both for the number
and value of the works it embraces, may vie with any similar in-
stitution in the country.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The list of poor supplied at the
expense of the parish of course varies according to circumstances.
In the ydar 1842, there were 34 paupers on the permanent roll,
and on the occasional 12,-making in all 46. There are various
small sums occasionally given to poor travellers passing through
the parish,-the number of whom is considerable, particularly af-
ter the harvest. The amount of relief afforded to regular pau-
pers varies from 4s. to 8s. a-month. In one instance, where an
idiot girl was in the family, 12s. were given for a considerable time.
The amount of legal assessment for the poor in the above-men-
tioned year was L. 200, which was apportioned as follows:-
