considerable sacrifices being made by superiors.  But were
the tenants by a little relaxation brought to easier circum-
stances, and their own labour under proper management,
applied to the improvement of their farms, there is little
doubt but the consequence would be advantageous to the
landlords, and ready payments made more effectual.

   Public Houses.-Little ale is drunk in the parish excepting
in private houses.  There are three inns or public houses
wherein whiskey is retailed, and travellers are accommoda-
ted, but not very comfortably for the better sort.  The hos-
pitality of the parish supplies the public instead of elegant
inns.

   Language.-The Gaelic or Erse language is chiefly spoken
through this parish.  Many indeed nosy speak both Gaelic
and English.  The names of places are mostly of Gaelic de-
rivation.  Some ending in ster, as Shebster, Brubster, &c.
are supposed to be of Danish origin.  Reay, the name of the
parish, is thought to be a corruption from Urray, the name
of a Pickish hero who inhabited the castle, to this day called
Knock Urray.
