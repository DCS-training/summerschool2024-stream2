any sudden alarm, they take wing in a body from their nests.
The gun makes frequent and bloody havock among them.
They are shot for amusement from boats, and the common
people appropriate their flesh and feathers to their own use.
The sport is cruel and unprofitable, as numbers die upon their
young in the nest, or expire before they reach the edge of the
projecting shelve.

   Planting.-There is no planting in the parish.  A good
many years ago, an experiment was made on a part of the
Warth Hill.  A few acres were planted with firs.-They
throve very well while young; but the fence being insuf-
ficient, and soon mouldering away, and the plantation exposed
to all possible injury, the whole perished, and at present no
vestige of it is to be seen.  The spot was well chosen, and had
the plantation been attended to, there is hardly a doubt, but
that it would have prospered.  No charge ought to be brought
against the soil and climate, as long as the exertions of indus-
try are wanting to overcome the obstacles complained of.
Without a suitable choice of ground, both as to soil and shel-
ter, and without proper inclosures, what success can or ought
to be expected?  The burns of Freswick, of Dungisbay, and
the winding braes of Gills, where, in defiance of the depreda-
tions, both of man and beast, some natural brush-wood main-
tains its residence, seem to claim a preference in experiments
of this sort.

   Roads, Inns, Traffic, etc.-The public roads in the parish are
those leading from Huna to Wick and Thurso, both lying along
the coast, the one in a southerly, and the other in a westerly
direction.  They have never been completed, and are very un-
comfortable in the winter.  A third from Huna, leading in-
to the middle of the country by Brabster, would be a great
