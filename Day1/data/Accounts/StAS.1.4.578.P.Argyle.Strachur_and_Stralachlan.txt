fully to indemnify the landlord for his expences.  where
such a situation can be had on the sea-coast, the village 
will do well.  The landlord ought to encourage some ma-
nufacture of wool or cotton, to furnish employment for the 
wives and children of the villagers.  If this plan were fol-
lowed, emigration would never be thought of, the population-
tion of the Highlands would be found not to decrease;
useful hands woulds be got at a call.  for every kind of la-
bour; servants got at moderate rates, for the purposes of 
agriculture or tending stocks; and what remain of the spi-
rit and mannners of the ancient Highlanders, for a length of
time, be preserved.-  Mr Maclachlan has begun a village on
his property in this parish.  It promises exceedingly well.
It is from his plan, and its successful appearance, that the 
above hints are suggestted.- If the sums to be expended on 
the fishing village, were distributed in premiums to the 
heritors in the Highlands, for building villlages, in propor-
tion to the number of people supportesd in each, every pur-
pose proposed by the Society, who have begun the fishing 
villages, would be effectually answered.  The State would 
be strengthened by sea and by land.  Ought not the State 
to encourage this scheme?
