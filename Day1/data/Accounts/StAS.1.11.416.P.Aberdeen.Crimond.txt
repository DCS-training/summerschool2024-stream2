*About the time that the return was made to Dr. Webster, and for some time
after, the population was said to be on the increase, owing chiefly to the divid-
ing of large farms into smaller ones.  But since the year 1770, the population
seems to have been upon the decrease.  In 1772, it appears, from the list kept
by the overseer of the roads, that there were 232 men in the parish, from 16 to
60, liable to work on the highways.  These have gradually decreased since.  In
1781, there were but 200; and last year only 171.

+In February 1793, there was a decrease of 15, owing to the removal of
2 families and 5 or 6 artizans out of the parish.-It is impossible to give any
account of the births, deaths, and marriages.  Scarcely any of the dissenters in-
sert their childrens births in the register; and even some of the Established
Church are equally negligent.  Before 1783, no register of burials and marri-
ages was kept, and scarcely the half have been registered since that period
The decrease of the population may, among other causes, contribute to the high
price of labour, and to what is of worse consequence, the difficulty of procuring
labourers.  At the time that the large farms were divided into smaller ones, the
subtenants and cottagers rented partly the smaller farms, and partly crofts, from
the heritor, which were generally too large.  When the possessors of these small
farms and crofts were found not to be the best improvers of the ground, the
landlords began to put two or more of the small farms into one, so that now
there are scarcely any subtenants, and few crofts let by the heritors.  As there
are no villages in the parish, and no cottages to be let, but such as have a piece
of ground annexed to them, young people, for want of a settlement, remove to the
manufacturing towns of Poterhead and Aberdeen; so that day-labourers and
handicraft people are procured with the greatest difficulty.  It would probably be
of great advantage both to themselves and the public, if the heritors would allot
