  Education.-In 1711, the sum of 9000 merks Scots was left
by the Rev. Alexander Orrock, minister of this parish, under pro-
vision of its remaining as a perpetual mortified fund, and the in-
terest given yearly to the schoolmaster of Hawick, on condition of
his teaching such poor children gratis as might be found by the
minister and heritors to have a genius for learning. Accordingly,
the benefit of this mortification was originally enjoyed along with
the parochial salary by the teacher of the parish school.  At a
subsequent period, however, the parochial salary was given to one
teacher, and the interest of Orrock's  mortification to another, and
the two schools remained separate for a period of about fifty years.
In 1824, it was deemed expedient to revert to the original ar-
rangement, and accordingly it was proposed and agreed to:
  1. That the schools be united under one rector, having right
both  to Orrock's, mortification, and to the parochial salary.
  2. That the rector be obliged at all times to keep an able as-
sistant qualified to teach writing, arithmetic, and mathematics.
  3. That the assistant be appointed by, and removable at, the
pleasure of the rector.
  4. That the entire salary, together with school-fees and other
emoluments, be divided between the rector and assistant, in the
proportions of  three-fifths to the former and two-fifths to the latter,
and that all necessary expenses connected with the establishment
be defrayed in the same proportions.  On this footing these schools
now stand.
   The parochial salary amounts to L.33, the interest of Orrock's
