with grass seeds among wheat, and after turnip among barley; to
take one crop of hay, and leave it next year for pasture; then break
it up again for oats. Thus a five years' rotation, three in crop and
two in grass, is generally observed. But sometimes, with the
stronger lands of clay or loam, a summer fallow is substituted for
the green crop; but by far the greater part is sown with potatoes,
which have for some years been cultivated to a great extent, not
only for home consumption, but for the London market; and some-
times, if a half dunging can be had for the lands, barley is sown
after wheat, in soils that will bear it.
   More than one-half of the parish is divided and enclosed with
stone and lime dikes along the road sides, and elsewhere with dry-
stone dikes, or ditch and hedge. Draining is also carried on to a
great extent, of late; for which nature, in many places, has given
great facility by the sloping of the ground. The quantities of ma-
nure made now in the farmers' straw yards would completely asto-
nish a farmer, forty or fifty years ago. The parish produces much
more grain, (and generally of the best quality,) than is sufficient for
its own consumption, and, of course, sends the overplus to market.
On the whole, farming seems to be as far advanced here, both in
system and practice, the soil and climate considered, as anywhere
else in Scotland.  At an average, there may be yearly in summer,
fallow, potatoes, and in drilled peas and beans, 340 acres; in tur-
nip, 180 do.; in wheat,250 do.; in barley, 360 do.; in oats, 900 do.
   Produce.--The average value of raw produce yearly raised in
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows:
