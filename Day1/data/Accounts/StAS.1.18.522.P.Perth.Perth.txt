wealth; whereas the bounties of the Divine Providence,
when they are liberally conferred, ought to excite in the
persons who receive them, a disposition to make greater and
more devout returns of gratitude to God.
   Some of the public amusements common in other places,
are to be found in Perth.  Among these, particular notice
may be taken of the amusements of the theatre.  Players oc-
casionally come to Perth, and sometimes they remain very
long.
   It is generally acknowledged, that many of the plays, com-
monly acted, have an immoral tendency; and the political
consequence of such a captivating amusement, frequently
introduced in a commercial city, cannot be a good one.
   It may afford what may be reckoned a piece of curious in-
formation, to relate how plays were regulated in Perth, more
than 200 years ago.  It appears from the old records, that a
company of players were in Perth, June 3d, 1589.  In obe-
dience to an act of the General Assembly, which had been
made in the year 1574-5, they applied to the consistory of
the church for a licence, and shewed a copy of the play,
which they proposed to exhibit.
   The words of the record, some of them a little modernised,
are, "Perth, June 3d, 1589, The minister and elders give
"licence to play the play, with conditions that no swearing,
"banning, nor one seurrility shall be spoken, which would
"be a scandal to our religion which we profess, and for an
"evil example unto others.  Also, that nothing shall be ad-
"ded to what is in the register of the play itself.  If any one
"who plays shall do in the contrary, he shall be warded, and
"make his public repentance."  That is, he was to be im-
prisoned, and afterwards to appear in the church to be re-
buked in the public place of repentance.
