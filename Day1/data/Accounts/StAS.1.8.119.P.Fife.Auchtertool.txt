     of Auchtertoul.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The parish is supplied with
coals from the neighbouring parish of Auchterderran:  The
distance may be from 2 to 3 miles.  The price is 18 d. for as
many as 2 horses can easily draw on a cart; and the same
sum for driving them home.-There is x public road goes
through the parish from E to W.  It is kept in repair by the
statute labour.  Each plough of land pays to it annually 10 s.
Sterling; half a plough pays 5 s., and downward in the same
proportion.  Each householder, not on the poor's roll, pays
18 d. annually.-Both men and women servants wages have
risen greatly of late.  Men servants used to get 6 L. Sterling
for the year; and women, 2 L. 10 s.:  But a man servant, now,
receives 8L.; and a woman 3 L., for the year.  The cause of
this sudden rise in the wages, is the manufactures, which
are carrying on in the sea coast towns, together with the re-
pairing and making the roads through the country, which
employ a great number of hands, and render servants scarce
as well as dear.  A day labourer's wages are 14 d. or 15 d.
per day.
