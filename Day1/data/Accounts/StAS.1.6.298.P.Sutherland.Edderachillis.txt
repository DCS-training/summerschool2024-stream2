besides catching and killing great numbers of them, to the great
benefit of their families in the way of provision, they make con-
siderable profit of the feathers, bartering them commonly for
an equal weight of wool.  The flesh of the birds, (the young
ones excepted), has a fishy isle, offensive to most palates.  Three
men, at different times, lost their lives by falling from the rocks,
where they were unhappily resambling in pursuit of them and
their eggs, in the memory of the present inhabitants.

Moriton at this time gave it its present name of Diurness, from the place of
his nativity, so that is cannot be considered as local or descriptive; but up-
on being established in his newly acquired estate, he brought over with him
from Lewis a colony of no less than sixty families, mostly of his own name,
to whom he gave lands upon his own property; hence it is that the name
of Moriton is to prevalent in these parts, for though the property be fallen
into other hands, the stock of the inhabitants remains.  Some generations
after this, it happened that the descendant lineal of this Ay Monson deed
childleis, and left a widow, a Sutherland woman, daughter of one Donald
Bain Matheson then proprietor of Sheeness.  This woman, finding herlest
all used by her late husband's relations, eloped in the night, carried with her
the rights by which the Moritons held Diuness, went to Dun-robin, the
Earl of Sutherland's seat, and delivered these papers into his hands.  Pos-
sessed of these rights only, the Earl considered himself as intitled to
claim Diurness for himself, and consequently had great bickerings with the
Morisons to bring them to pay rent to him; but they continuing obstinate
and refractory, and being encouraged in an under-hand manner by the laird of
Far and his agents, the Earl at length became tired of contending with
them, and agreed with the laird of Far, ancestor of Lord Reay, to give Di-
urness to him for a feu duty of 60 marks in the year; and in this manner
came the Reay family to be possessed of this estate, but the feu duty,
though still continued, is now reduced to a taste.
