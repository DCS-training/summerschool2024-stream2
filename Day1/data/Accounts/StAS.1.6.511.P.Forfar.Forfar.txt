parishes, and afterwards united, is not certain; but the burgh
and landwards parts of the parish have long had, and continue to
have, distinct interests in so far as relates to the supplying of
the poor, and they make seperate collections for them at the 
church door.
   The form of the parish is irregular, its greatest extent from
N. to S. being about 6 English miles, and from E. to W about
5; though in some places, it does not exceed 3 English miles
in breadth and 4 in lenght.  The town in which the church
and manse are built is situated near the N. W. corner of the

lie arounf it, at, or within the distance of four computed

were, with hillocks of various sizes, as if nature had here, at
some period, suffered a convulsion.  Though low with respect
to the circumjacent ground on every side excepting the West,
it is high in comparison to the general level of the country.
The lakes and springs, a mile to the east of it, run eastward
and empty themselves into the German ocean at Lunan Bay.
Its own springs, and those on the west side of it, run directly
