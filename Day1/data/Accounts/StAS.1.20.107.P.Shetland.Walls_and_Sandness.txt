March, and bear in the end of April.  Harvest in the be-
ginning or middle of September.-Cabbages are produced
in great plenty, and form a great part of the winter food
of the lower people.  They are considered as a good cor-
rective of scorbutic habits.  Kitchen-stuffs grow to great per-
section; but, from being too near the sea, shrubbery will not
thrive.-A great number of horses are reared; but as the
inhabitants, at least in Walls, do not in general employ them
in drudgery-work, as in other parishes, they are allowed to
run wild in the common.  They are so hardy, that they re-
ceive no maintenance from the owners, even in the winter
season.  They live to a great age, when domesticated.
They are sold in great numbers every year to Orkney-
men, who come to this parish, and other places in the coun-
try, with quantities of linen, which finds a ready market.
The horses are small, as the people always imprudently
sell the most likely young ones, and do not preserve pro-
per breeders, by which means the breed is much diminish-
ed in size.  Vast numbers of swine are also produced; but,
as they go wild in the common during the summer season,
they are very injurious to the pasturage, by rooting and
digging it up.  They are often also hurtful, by feizing up-
on young lambs, and eating them.  But, owing to a com-
plaint, lately lodged against them, their number is greatly
diminished.-The sheep were lately numbered by the tacks-
man of the teinds, and were found to amount to about
8000.

   Imports and Exports.-Household-stores, for those of bet-
ter stations, are imported from Leith and Hamburgh: and
salt, deals, boats, fishing-lines, hooks and meal, are import-
ed for the use of the seamen.  The exports are the same as
in other parts of the country, such as ling, cod, tusk, oil,
