     Statistical Account

their disappearance, we heard from that quarter of the hea-
vens a loud explosion, similar to that from the discharge of
a piece of ordnance.  The meteor was observed, and the
explosion was heard at Dunkeld-house, and the time there
corresponded with the observation here.  A few days
afterward, a severe frost set in here, with some snow, and
continued, with a few momentary intervals of thaw, till
the end of January 1792, during all which time the sur-
face of the ground was one sheet of ice: The people were
obliged to carry in water to their cattle; and neither man
nor horse could venture abroad without having their feet
secured with iron.  A remarkable rainy season followed;
the most luxuriant part of the crop was lodged in the begin-
ning of August, and never ripened; harvest was not got home
till near tile middle of November, and even then in very
poor condition; such of the crop as has been already thresh-
ed out is by no means productive: The barley is found ve-
ry unfit for malting, and in many places, it requires two
boils of oats to yield one boll of meal.  The meal is in ge-
neral very indifferent in its quality.  The people are natu-
rally apprehensive of bad consequences.  But their greatest
suffering at present arises from their want of fuel.  The
peats that were cast last summer, could neither be got dried,
nor carried home, on account of the incessant rains.  A boll
of coals, i.e. 42 stone weight, costs just now (Christmas
1792), 8 s.  Sterling at the shore of Perth, and on account
of the extreme badness of the roads, it costs 4 s. more for
the carriage of it to Dunkeld.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The farmers, in general,
enjoy the great advantage of a perennial fountain of good
water in their immediate neighbourhood.  We observed,
that in the higher parts of the parish there is plenty of
good peat, and, in the lower parts, broom, furze and brush-
