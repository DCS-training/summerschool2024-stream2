an instance of oats yielding upwards of 40 from 1, thinly sown
after burnt moss.  Many parts are capable of great improve-
ment, which hitherto have continued almost in a state of na-
ture.  There is much need of draining and summer plough-
ing.  Lime is too little used.  Even near the village and
heart of the parish, there is much wet and waste ground,
which, though capable of being fertilised and beautified by
skill and industry, is likely still to excite in the traveller the
idea of poverty and indolence.  Green crops are but little
in use.  Planting and inclosing have been practised a little,
though they are still too much neglected.  There are large
tracks of moss, some of which yield excellent peat for fuel.
There are two natural woods; one of which was fold a few
years ago for upwards of 500 L. Sterling; besides these, there

good deal of ironstone; the quality of the latter is remarkably
good.  Two of the proprietors have given a lease to the Do-
van Company, one at 9 1/2 d. per ton, the other at 6 d. the
Company working it, and paying damages.

   Rent, Manufactures, etc.-The valued rent of the whole

about 2500 L. Sterling.  The proprietors assessed themselves
some time ago for 48 ploughgates, though the real number
may be 20 more.  The two horse plough is now much used.
Some farms are wholly let for grass, which, in the hilly parts
