called Johnny Notions, among his neighbours.  Unassisted by
education, and unfettered by the rules of art, he stands unri-
valled in this business.  Several thousands have been inocula-
ted by him, and he has not lost a single patient.
   His success being so remarkable, it may not be improper to
take some notice of the method he pursues, in case it can fur-
nish any useful lints to persons of the medical prosession.
He is careful in providing the best matter, and keeps it a long
time before he puts it to use,-sometimes 7 or 8 years.  And,
in order to lessen its virulence, he first dries it in peat sinoak,
and then puts it under ground, covered with camphor.
Though many physicians recommend fresh matter, this self-
taught practitioner finds from experience, that it always proves
milder to the patient, when it has lost a considerable degree of
its strength.  He uses no lancet in performing the operation,
but, by a small knife, made by his own hands, he gently rai-
ses a very little of the outer skin of the arm, so that no blood
follows:  then puts in a very small quantity of the matter,
which he immediately covers with the skin, that had been thus
raised.  The only plaister he uses, for healing the wound, is
a bit of cabbage leaf.  It is particularly remarkable, that there
is not a single instance in his practice, where the infection has
not taken place, and made its appearance at the usual time.
He administers no medicines during the progress of the disease;
nor does he use any previous preparation.-He is a singular
instance of an uncommon variety of talents, being a tailor, a
joiner,a clock and watch-mender, a blacksmith, and a physi-
cian.
