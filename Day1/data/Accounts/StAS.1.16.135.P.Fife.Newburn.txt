  
   Improvements Suggested.-Besides putting the roads in
better repair, the establishment of a more regular market
would also be a very considerable advantage in this part of
the country.  Another disadvantage, under which not
only this, but the adjacent parishes labour, is the weight
of bread being left entirely to the will of the baker.
Wherever this is the case, the consumer is liable to sur-
fer loss; and the very exemption from any regulation on
this point is a temptation to injustice.  A remedy cer-
tainly exists somewhere, and it ought to be speedily ap-
plied.  To remove the local inconvenience complained of,
or rather the general evil, might not the bread be occa-
sionally inspected by some proper person appointed for that
purpose by the justices of the peace?  And wherever the
weight is found deficient, let the bread be given to the
poor.  The very idea of being subject to the jurisdiction of
the justices of peace, or of feeling the consequences of the
complaints lodged with them, would operate as a powerful
restraint on men who have it in their power to impose
both on the rich and the poor, it is said, by charging what
they chuse for a loaf, which might be purchased in other
places, where there is a check and controuling power over
bakers, for a far more reasonable price.  While some of
the people complain of imaginary grievances under the
happy constitution where they live, it is hoped the real
one now specified will be removed as soon as it is possible.

   Antiquities.-There are vestiges of the east part of the
church having been a Roman Catholic chapel.
   If we may give credit to the records and traditions
which have been transmitted to us of that early period, the
Culdees, who are thought to have been the first regular
clergy in Scotland, had a church and residence in this parish
