tides.  One light-house has been erected lately in the island
of Scalpa in Harris, which is reckoned of great utility to
the numerous shipping that frequent this channel, in their 
voyages to and from the Baltic.  The harbours of the pa-
rish are loch Arniford, Loch Bay, Pottech, Dunvigan
Loch, and Loch Harlosh.  As the coast is very bold and
high, with a great depth of water, it seldom happens, that
any vessel is wrecked upon it.  About 30 years ago, a ves-

were treated by the people with the greatest humanity,
and the cargo was preserved with the utmost care, for the
benefit of the underwriters.  This forbearance, however,
may be rather ascribed to the attention and authority of the
gentlemen, than to the humanity of the common people.

   Hills.-The most remarkable mountains in the parish,
are the two Hallivails, situated within a mile of each other,

land-marks, so no seaman can mistake.  The hills are all
covered with heath, with a few green spots here and there.

   Population.-The population of this parish, and of the
whole island, is increasing, and has been increasing for at

remember lands which lay waste in several districts, not
only of this parish, but in several parts of the island, for
want of inhabitants to occupy them.  Of late, the inhabi-
tants have multiplied so much, that from August 1771, to
October 1790, eight large transports have failed from this
island with emigrants, to seek settlement in America; the
