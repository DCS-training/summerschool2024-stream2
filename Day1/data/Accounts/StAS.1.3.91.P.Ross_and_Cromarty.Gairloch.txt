   Agriculture.-Oats and barley are sown in this country.
Some of the gentlemen sow a small quantity of pease, which

May to the 10th of June; our latest barley is seldom the worst
part of the crop, when the summer proves warm and
showery.  Our harvest commences about the end of August,
and the crop is gathered in about the 10th of October.  Our
crop frequently suffers much from shaking winds, attended
with heavy cold rain, about the autumnal equinox.

long tract of different countries, and proved fatal to many.
