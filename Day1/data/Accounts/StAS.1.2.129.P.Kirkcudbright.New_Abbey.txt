sown on each acre.  The fifth crop, and sometimes the sixth
is cut for hay; and the field is afterwards used for pasture,
till its turn of being broken up for oats in the tenth year re-
turns; then it is limed with somewhat more than half the first
quantity of lime, and the former rotation of crops is followed.
By this mode of cultivation, a farm of 9 divisions will thus lie
in crop, year 1st and 2 d oat, 3 d potatoes, etc. 4th barley, or
wheat, 5th hay, 6th hay or pasture, 7th, 8th, and 9th pasture.
This course is pretty strictly followed in the lower division,
consisting of about 1600 acres; and, it is kept in view, as
much as the nature of the soil will admit, in the upper part of
the parish, in which there may be 400 acres arable; 150 of
which are usually in oats and barley, and the remainder in hay
or pasture.

   Implements of Husbandry.-About 52 ploughs are employed
in agriculture, mostly of the true Scots construction, and a few
of the English form.  They are generally drawn by two horses;
but in stiff and steep soils, three horses a-breast are yoked to
each plough; in both cases the ploughman drives the horses.
There are from 75 to 80 carts in the parish; a great number,
in proportion to the ploughs, owing to an improvement lately
introduced, of using light single horse-carts, in place of the 
large heavy double carts, which were formerly in use.

   Seed-time and Harvest.-Wheat is sown from the 1st of
October to the middle of November, and reaped from the
middle of August to the 1st of September.  Barley is sown af-
ter the 10th of April, and reaped at the same time with the
wheat.  Oaks sown from the 1st of March, and reaped in
September.  Potatoes are planted in April and early in May,
and dug up after the 1st of October.
