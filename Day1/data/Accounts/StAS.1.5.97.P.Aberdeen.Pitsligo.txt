In summer, the mills can scarcely perform any work, owing
to a deficiency of water; but there is a sufficient supply of
that valuable element for the common  purposes of life.  As
there is little marshly ground in the parish, there are seldom
any fogs in it.  The air is dry and wholesome, but the nor-
therly storms are sometimes hurtful to the crops, as the coun-
try is destitute  of trees, and every kind of shelter.  On the
south side of the road above mentioned, the soil is generally
black and light, very well adapted for grass, but not fit for
producing weighty crops of grain.  Towards the north, the
soil is generally a yellow clay, which produces barley of a
good quality, and is mostly all in tillage.  In this quarter,
the farmers make use of sea ware as a manure.  They  have
likewise the advantage of an inexhaustible bank of sea shells,
which extends along the whole coast; and a due quantity of
which, when laid on the fields, produces the same effects as
lime, marle, or any other calcareous substance.  This parish
abounds with stones of all sizes, and is therefore extremely
well adapted for being laid out in inclosures.

   Cairns.-On the side of the high road, from Frasersburgh
to Banss, are some cairns or tumuli, about 60 feet in circum-
ference at the base, composed of round stones, piled up in a
conical shape to the height of 30 feet.  There are several
similar cairns in the neighbouring parishes, and they are evi-
dently monumental repositories of the deal.  On opening
one of them some years ago, large flag stones were found
placed in the ground, in the form of a chest or coffin, and
containing ashes of burnt bones.  Some arrow heads of slint
were also found, but no weapons of metal of any kind;
whence it may be conjectured, that they are of great anti-
quity.  Tradition says, that they are the burying places of
hostile invaders from Denmark or Norway, who were de-
