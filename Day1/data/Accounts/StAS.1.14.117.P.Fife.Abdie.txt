     of Abdie.

   The face of the country, in all parts of the parish, par-
ticularly towards the E. and W. extremities, is remark-
ably uneven.  The quantity of arable land, however, is
probably not less than in any equal extent of surface
throughout the whole length of the Ochil Hills.  From
the free circulation of air among these hills, and the pre-
vailing dryness of the soil below, the climate, in most
parts of the parish, proves very salubrious.  The situation
of the minister's manse is, perhaps, as unfavourable to
health, as any other house in the parish; for it stands
close by a lake of considerable extent in low and wet
ground.

   Hills, Woods, Rivers, Lakes, etc. Of the many hills
in the parish, 2, Clatchart-Crag and Norman's Law, are
remarkable; the one for its abrupt precipitious front,
the other for its height. Abdie is bare of wood, there
being only one considerable spot in the whole extent of
the parish planted with trees.  It is to be hoped, how-
ever, that the proprietors will be induced to convert the
inarable summits of some of the hills to use and beauty,
by covering them with wood.  The grounds, in many
places, require shelter; and there is good reason to be-
lieve, that the several species of sir planted in the neigh-
bourhood with success, will thrive in the high lands of
Abdie.  No river runs through this parish:  It is, not-
withstanding, well watered.  It contains several lakes or
lochs, the principal of which, in point of largeness and
beauty, is the loch of Lindores:  this is a fine sheet of
water in the middle division of the parish, of nearly a
mile in length, and of unequal breadth:  It belongs to
Mr. Simon of Brunton.  It perch and pike, its ducks
