tempt his neighbour to outbid him at next set, not far dis-
tant.-As a farther inducement to agricultural improvements,
perhaps it might have a good effect if the landholders should,
after the laudable example of the Highland Society upon a
larger scale, each upon his own estate, distribute among his
tenants some little premiums for improving a spot of ground
here and there.  Furnishing them with tools and instruments
of husbandry might also be to some purpose.-As to fisheries;
I have long been of opinion, that a village consisting merely
of professional fishers could never exist in the Highlands.
Their success in fishing is perfectly precarious, and, even if
it were otherwise, they are at a distance from markets.  But
if the soil was cultivated, so as to furnish the necessaries of
life upon easy terms, and manufactures set up in proper si-
tuations; inhabitants of various descriptions would flock in
from all quarters, and would in all probability in the course
of a few years form populous and flourishing villages.  In
such a state of things, there would not be wanting abundance
of persons to prosecute the fishing, with the utmost vigour,
of their own accord.-In the meantime, I must observe, that
an alteration on the salt laws is much required.  They seem
to be rather strict and intricate for the present state of the
Highlands.-The extension of useful knowledge, also, would
have a happy tendency to rouse the Highlander to attend to
the means of improving his country.  For this purpose,
schools and missions ought to be established in as many situa-
tions as possible.  From want of these means of instruction,
the present state of the Highlands is truely deplorable; and
it is rather unfortunate that the Society for propagating
Christian Knowledge should have adopted regulations which
stand as a bar to the benefits of the institution.  Schools of
industry, as for spinning, sewing, net-making, &c. should
likewise be established.
