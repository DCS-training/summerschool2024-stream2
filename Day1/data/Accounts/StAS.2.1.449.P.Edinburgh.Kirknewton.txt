   There is at East Calder a place of worship belonging to the
United Associate Synod, originally erected in 1776. It draws its
congregation from a circuit of considerable extent, including several
of the neighbouring parishes, and is very respectably attended.
   Education.-Close by the parish church stands the parish
school, erected a few years ago, substantial and commodious.
The instruction afforded includes the higher as well as the more
ordinary branches, and is conducted according to the most im-
proved system, and in the most efficient manner. The salary of
the schoolmaster is the maximum. The number attending is
upwards of 100. The fees are, English reading, grammar, &c.
2s. 6d.; writing with the above, 3s.; arithmetic with the above,
4s.; French, taught singly, 7s.; Latin, 7s.; French and Latin,
8s.; mathematics singly, 5s.; mathematics with any other branch,
2s. 6d., in addition to the fees of that branch. The provision
here made for the education of poor children is very satisfactory.
The kirk-session is authorised to recommend such as they believe
to be proper objects; and for these the teacher receives and the
heritors pay half fees.
   There is at East Calder it private school built originally by sub-
scription, the property of which, with the dwelling-house and
small garden attached, is held in shares by individuals connected
with the parish, and taking an interest in its education. The
number attending, here is about 100, and the school is well taught.
   Besides these, there are schools, both at Kirknewton and at
East Calder, for the instruction of females in the branches, pecu-
liar to their sex.
   While the provision for education thus afforded is sufficiently
ample and convenient for the great bulk of the population, there
is one part of the parish where a want is still seriously felt, viz.
at the south-west extremity, the distance from any school being
fully four miles. A school in the neighbourhood of Causey-
end might be expected to draw from this district and the adjoin-
ing portion of the parish of Mid-Calder, in which the want is
equally felt, from 25 to 80 Scholars.
