moss, and in several parts it is gravellish or sandy, or
chingily.  It is in general not deep, rather shallow; in
some parts too shallow and rocky.  The surface is rather
flat; for though there are several hills or rising grounds,
yet they are of no considerable height, having a very gen-
tle declivity in general from their summits to the subjacent
plains, especially in the lower end of the parish.

   Disadvantages arising from the Soil, etc.-To the cir-
cumstances above mentioned relative to the soil may be
ascribed, in a great measure, its wetness, which prevails
very much, especially in winter, spring, and latter end of
harvest; besides, the fogs, and mists, and rains, which are
rather too frequent in this country, contribute much to
this disagreeable quality; another circumstance which tends
to its wetness, is the kind of strata, which, in general, is not,
in the arable ground, and other places, more than 1 foot,
or 1 1/2, or 2 feet at the utmost, below the surface.  These
strata in many places consist of a hard, heavy, petrified kind
of clay, which may properly be called caput mortuum.  In
most places, especially in the lower end of the parish, they
consist of flags, as they are here called, or large thin stones,
which lie in a horizontal position, and run close to one an-
other, without any great interval or interruption.  From
these two last circumstances it happens, that the surface is
kept perpetually wet, except in the summer and harvest,
for neither of these strata will suffer the water to sink or
filtrate through them, therefore it must remain on the sur-
face, till it is either exhaled by sun and wind, or runs
off along these strata to the adjacent swamps, lakes, and
burns, which, by the bye, must be very slow, the declivity
to these being in many places very inconsiderable.  This,
moreover, occasions, in a great measure, the great damp-
ness or chilliness of the ground, which are so inimical to
vegetation, and peculiarly noxious to the roots of trees,
