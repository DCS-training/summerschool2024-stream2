     Statistical Account

falling from the surrounding hills makes the bottom cold, and
occasions late harvests.  The climate is the same with that of
the parishes around it.  There are no natural woods, but
Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, and Mr. M'Leod of Cadboll,
have some hundred acres planted with Scotch firs.

   Cattle, Cultivation, and Produce.-There are about 1000
black cattle in the parish.  There are no sheep walks; but
as every tenant and cottager tears a few sheep, the number
upon the whole must be considerable.  As there are no im-
provements in husbandry, the time and attention of the peo-
ple is taken up in the management of the farms, which re-
quire many hands, and occupy many cattle, their horses and
oxen being of a small size.  Those of Mr. Hugh Scobie of
Ardmore, however, must be excepted.  This gentleman la-
bours successfully according to file new system, and was late-
ly at the expence of bringing a manure, known by the name
of shelly sand, from the island of Tanara, near Ullapool,
through the Pentland Frith, to his farm at Ardmore.  His
labour and expence are already most amply repaid.  His stock
of cattle is large, and of the best quality, the place giving
him every advantage for these purposes.  In summer he abounds
with grass, and in winter he has the best of covering, and a
good shore.  He likewise rears large quantities of wheat, bar-
ley, oats, beans, pease, potatoes, turnips, and artificial grass.
The farm of Easter-Fearn, for which, about 40 years ago, a
tenant could not be found at the rent of 21 L., is so improved
by watering, that it lets now at more than triple that sum.

   Inclosures, Fuel, etc.-This parish is very capable of im-
provement, having great tracts of moors, gently sloping, with
clay and gravelly bottoms*.  The grounds inclosed by Sir
