   Commerce.-Five and forty years ago there was not a
single shop, nor any imported article for sale in the parish.
About the year 1750, the first shop was opened in Buckie,
at that time known as a fishing station only; at present
there are 8 merchants of shop-keepers in it who trade to
the extent of L. 5000, exclusive of grain, annually.  Origi-
nally unbred to business, and possessed of a small stock,
they began their merchandise on a very narrow scale; as
their stock increased, they extended their views, and
launched out into new branches.  They import coals, salt,
iron, and other necessaries; and export fish and grain.
About 500 bolls of salt are imported annually; and this
summer (1793) 2500 bolls of wheat, barley, oats, and meal
have been exported from Buckie.

   Manufactures.-Two or three weavers manufacture linen
to the amount of L. 200 yearly; and some months ago a
small manufacture in hemp was established at Buckie.  A
man from Dundee is employed to drefs the hemp, and it
is afterward converted into lines, canvas, and nets.  We
have no flax-dresser in the parish, and yet the spinning of
flax into yarn is an important article.  In 1750, a manu-
facturer* in Cullen introduced this branch here; and in
1759, a weaver, still alive, was the first residing agent em-
ployed in this new line; since the above period, consider-
able progress has been made in it.  The flax, mostly Dutch, 
is sent dressed from Aberdeen, Frasersburgh, Banff, Portsoy,
Cullen, Huntley, Keith, and Fochabers, to different agents,

grievous.  Sound policy requires their total abolition; and it is to be
hoped, that the time is fast approaching, when every vestige of the 
servitude will disappear for ever; and mutual stipulations, on equal terms,
properly defined and clearly expressed, will ascertain what man has a right
to exact from man.
