     Statistical Account

the proprietors of the surrounding parishes of Kirkden, Kin-
nell, Fernel, etc. who are enclosing and planting their several
proportions.  About 370 acres of this moor have fallen to
the share of the parish of Guthrie.  Almost the whole nor-
thern part of the parish sinks gently to the south and east,
from the top, near to the north west end of it, called the
Hill of Guthrie, the highest part of which is probably not
much more than 500 feet above the level of the sea.  There
is no hill in the southern part of the parish, but the lowest
ground in it is probably near 700 feet higher than the sea.
M ft of the parish, especially the southern part, is too wet.
The annexed table states accurately, the extent and kinds of
land in the southern part of the parish, being the contents of
a map from a late mensuration.  The northern part is
taken from the proportions of oats, barley, pease, etc. sown
by the different farmers according to their own reports, and
cannot be supposed so accurate.  The extent of it is, probably,
rather more, than is stated in the table.
