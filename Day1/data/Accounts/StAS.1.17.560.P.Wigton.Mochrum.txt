parish, it becomes gradually more thin and stony, while a
large extent, on the cast and west sides, mostly consisting of
rocky eminences, or mossy swamps and lakes, exhibits a bleak

are, however, scattered up and down in this bleak region,
some small pieces of good dry arable land.  Owing, perhaps,

carriages, has, of late been completely repaired, and carried
along the brink of the foresaid hill, close by the sea, in a di-
rection now wonderfully level indeed; for, to effectuate this,
such deep caves were to fill up, and such immense rocks to
