mistaken and delusive policy. Whisky is emphatically the curse
of North Berwick, the fruitful source of most of its domestic
miseries; and these are oftentimes of the most mournful, and bit-

of Pencaitland and Tranent,-a distance of twelve or fourteen
miles. The coals are very costly, and form here a very heavy
burthen on the industry of the poor man.
