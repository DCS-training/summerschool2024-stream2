     Statistical Account

   The number of weekly pensioners is 12.  The weekly pen-
sion is 12s 9d. besides considerable sums given from time to 
time, to other poor, not upon the list, and the purchase of
coals, for all the poor annually.  It may here be remarked,
that, besides the private benefactions of residing heritors to
the poor, they derive much benefit from the circumstance of
such families being of our own communion, and attending the
established church, which has generally been the case, for a
century past.  During 40 years, and upwards, no poor have
had occasion or been allowed to beg; the parish being both a-
ble and willing to maintain its own poor.  Many however,
are apt to give liberally to strolling vagrants, or sturdy beggars,
who infest this district and the neighbourhood; an evil severe-
ly felt, and which stands much in need of an effectual remedy.

   Church, Patronage, &c.-The patrons are the masters of
the New College of St. Andrews.  The manse was built about
the year 1748; the offices in the year 1774; and an excellent
garden wall, in 1788.  the manse is inconveniently situated;
being distant from the church about a mile.  The stipend is
L. 42 : 4 : 5 4/229, with 3 chalders victual, half meal, and half
bear.  The glebe consists of 7 acres, including houses and
garden.  The church was repaired, and almost new built, in
the year 1760.  There were, in popish times, 4 burial places
in the parish.  The principal one, at present, is in the island
of Inchbrayock.-The inhabitants belong, with very few ex-
ceptions, to the established church.  In 1788, there were on-
ly 6 Seceders, and 16 Episcopalians.

   School.-Very lately, a substantial and elegant house was
built for the schoolmaster; and his yearly salary was raised,
within these few years, from L. 8 to L. 20.; the school fees,
and other perquisites, may amount to L. 20 more.  Adjoin-
