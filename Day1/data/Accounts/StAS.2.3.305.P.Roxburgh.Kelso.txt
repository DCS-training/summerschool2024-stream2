form the higher grounds in the vicinity were forced upwards.  But,
whatever may be the history of them rocky barriers, there seems lit-
tle reason to doubt that the space inclosed by them, scooped out as
it is in the form of a basin as if for the purpose of receiving the
contents of two superb rivers, and diversified by haugh and mea-
dow ground, and by gravelly terraces rising and retiring one above
another, on both sides of the stream, like the tiers of a fortification,
bespeaks the action of running water.  Whether the Tweed and
Teviot, at the remote period at which they flowed at some of the
higher levels indicated by these terraces, united to form at this,
particular place a lake whose subsequent drainage excavated the
lower parts of the vale, or flowed as a river as they do still, only
with a more lateral and serpentine course, may be a question dif-
ficult to settle; but few geologists will be disposed to doubt that
the parallel terraces, on one of which the Castle of Floors stands,
constitute the remains of a plain or strath, of which all that is
wanting has travelled downwards to form or enrich the haugh-
lands of Berwickshire and Northumberland.
  Botany.--Though there is neither mountainous nor marshy
ground within its limits, the parish is not wanting in plants of suf-
ficient variety and beauty to reward the search of the florist. In the
