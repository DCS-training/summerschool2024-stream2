     of Gigha and Cara.

   Roads and Ferry.-From the harbour of Gigulum sound,
there is an excellent line of carriage road, finished half-way
to the north end of the island, which will soon be completed the
whole length, to the great convenience of the inhabitants, who
are now beginning to use carts, of which the ??? already fix
in the island.  The statute labour for making roads is converted
into money at the rate of 1 s. 6 d., or 2 s. for each person
annually.  Besides this fund, there is a shilling in the pound, va-
lued rent, payable over the whole county, by an act of Parlia-
ment passed in 1774; but the money thus raised, goes to the
great lines of road (particularly specified in that act) on the
main land; and as there are still incomplete, nothing of the
money exigible by the act of Parliament, can be applied to o-
ther places; consequently the road in Gigha has been carried
on at the expence of the principal proprietor.  Between
Gigha and the opposite couast of Kintyre, there is a regular
ferry and two boats, one in the island, and one on the main
land.  The disadvantage attending this ferry, is, the want of
a quay on the Kintyre side, which is so much exposed to
the storm, that in winter it is not easy to save a boat,
otherwise than by drawing her up.  To this may be added
another inconvenience, the want of a proper house to accom-
modate people who wait at the ferry.  Both these inconveni-
encies might be removed at a small expence, and, if removed,
that expence would soon be refunded.  It is with regret it
must be observed, that such inattention to public convenience
has been, and still is, too frequent in the Highlands.

   Houses and Quarries.-Within these 4 years, two new
public boules, each consisting of two storeys and garrets, and
a malt kiln and granary, all with slated roofs, have been built,
besides repairs and offices about the old manse, which the
principal proprietor occupies as a temporary mansion house,
