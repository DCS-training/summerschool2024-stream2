part of the former building being thrown down. Its shape is that
of a cross the old house being in the centre.
   The minister's glebe contains about 6 Scotch acres, and has
been valued at L.15 per annum.
   The stipend is 17 cbalders: at least that quantity was awarded
by the last augmentation, which took place in the year 1825;
but from the state of the teinds at present there is a very con-
siderable deficiency in that amount. The stipend of Kincardine,
in March 1710, was "four chalders victual, and four hundred
merks money, yearlie;" in 1741, during Mr David Ross's incum-
bency, L.559, 6s. 8d. Scots; in 1770, during Mr Gilbert Robertson's
incumbency, it was augmented to L.840 Scots, (or L.70 Sterling).
In 1791, Mr Andrew Gallie, minister, received an augmentation of
4 chalders victual, one-third bear, two-thirds oatmeal, and L.1, 13s.
4d.Sterling, making it in all four chalders,and L.71,13s.4d.money.
In 1807, Mr Alexander Macbean, minister, received an additional
augmentation of 4 chalders victual, and L.3, 6s. 8d. Sterling,
making it 8 chalders, and L.75 Sterling; and, in 1825, the pre-
sent incumbent had awarded by decreet of Session, 4 chalders 5
bolls additional, including the sum of L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion
elements, which made the stipend 17 chalders in all, as already
stated.
   Kincardine existed as a parish prior to the Reformation ; and
from that period till the Revolution the Bishop of Ross was pa-
tron. The patronage is now possessed by Mackenzie of Cro-
martie, betwixt whom and the Crown it was disputed for many
years. The first ecclesiastical notice we possess of Kincardine
occurs in the "Register of Ministers, Exhorters, and Readers,
and of their Stipends, 1563-1576," (which was printed for the
Maitland Club in 1880, and consists of two parts, or rather two
separate lists,-the one from 1563 to 1572, and the other from
1572 to 1576,) where, under the head " Ministers in Ross," in
the first list, is the following:-
"Kincardine,} Farquhar Reid, exhortar, xl. merkis, and xx.
 Etherthane,} merkis mair sen Lambmes 1569."
 Ministers of Kincardine.-1. Mr Hucheoun Ross was "minister
at Kinken in Ross," or "Kincairn," (as Kincardine was original-
ly written,) from 1578 down to 1607,-bow much later has not
been ascertained; and he was undoubtedly the first Protestant
minister settled in the parish. *
