     Statistical Account

any, as every man, who is disposed to work, can always have
good employment and good wages, either as a mechanic or
a labourer.  Although few of the farmers have leases, from
many years experience, they consider themselves as perfectly
secure, and in no danger of being removed, while they live
peaceably and are punctual in the payment of their rents,
which are very moderate, when compared with those of the
neighbouring estates.  They are sensible the heritor could
have more rent than he draws from them.  He has abolish-
ed all customs and services; and, if any of them build good
houses, a proper allowance is made.  The kind and indul-
gent manner in which they are treated by the proprietor,
has strongly attached them to him.  They are sensible that
he is happy in beholding their prosperity, and will not from
thence take any advantage to raise their rents above what
they can bear.  The manner of living here is greatly chang-
ed within the last thirty years.  The farmers now appear at
church and market dressed in English superfine cloth, and
many of their wives and daughters in cloaks and bonnets.
The man-servant is as expensively arrayed as his master, and
the dress of the maid-servant is little inferior to that of her
mistress.  The food of the inhabitants formerly consisted
chiefly of oat meal, and sometimes of fish, but these gener-
ally salted and dryed; owing to this cause, the scurvy was a
common disease.  They raised few vegetables, and turnips
were often brought by sea from Aberdeen.  Every cottager
now has his turnips, cabbages, potatoes; and many of the
farmers have their mutton, fed by themselves for summer
food, and the greatest part of them kill a fed ox or cow, for
winter provision.+

40 fat cattle, weighing from 14 to 24 stone, were killed in this parish for
food during the winter, besides a considerable number of sheep.
