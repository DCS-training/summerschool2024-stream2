high nor too low, but as near as possible to the section of a
large circle:  By which the surface-water will easily drain
off, without lodging; and while the crowns are not too
much enriched, nor the surrows impoverished, the whole
will be made equally fertile, dry, and prolific, and not un-
frequently be accessible to the plough earlier in the spring
than the fields upon the declivities of the surrounding hills;
and the reason is obvious, because there is no spouts, no un-
der-ground water to get rid of; nothing but superficial
moisture alone.

   Draining in Loam and inclining Fields.-The southern
declivities of the hills in this parish, in general, consist of rich
loam, which is exceedingly prolific.  But as the surface is
irregular, and as the substrata consist of rocky protuberances,
veins of sand, and, in some places, impervious till or schif-
tus; while, in a natural state, they are spouty, and until they
are drained, in many places they are totally incapable of
any agricultural improvement.  The manner of draining
these is various, according to the shape and lie of the field,
and also of the different places where the water shows itself.
If from one spring only, and if that can be cut off from the
grounds above, the talk is easy; but if the spouts or springs
are many, or if the appearance happens in several places,
and no original spring be discovered, the drains must be
carried through the field, in such a manner as to communi-
cate with every place where the water appears, and this is
in general done according to the skill, experience, or some-
times the caprice of the farmer; sometimes zig-zag,
