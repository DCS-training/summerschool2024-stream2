rotation upon infield.  The outfield, after producing 3 or
4 crops of oats, is left unplowed 3, 4, or 5 years more.  The
ridges of both Out and Infield are generally very broad, and
not very straight.  They are often very much raised in the
middle, and baulks left betwixt them without any apparent
necessity.  There are some farms of considerable extent.  The
rest are small; and the horses and cattle of two neighbouring
tenants are often joined in one plough.  The number of
ploughs is 47, which are drawn by 88 horses, 87 cows, and
153 oxen and young cattle.  Creels (or baskets) are still used
for carrying dung and fuel on the sides of horses.  Where
there are neither green crops, hay, inclosures, nor winter
herding, cattle and sheep must fare very poorly for a consi-
derable part of the year.  The greater part of the sheep be-
long to the possessors of crofts and pendicles; and they are left,
for one half of the year, to wander, during the day, in small
parcels of from 10 to 40.  They are therefore much more
detrimental to the neighbours, than advantageous to their
owners.  It is supposed, however, that this parish commands
hill pasture for sheep, to the extent of at least 2000 acres.

   Farm-Rents, Wages, etc.-The rent of the infield ground
is from 12 s. to 21 s.; of outfield, from 2 s. to 5 s. per acre.
The rent is paid partly in money, and partly in grain, cus-
toms, services, and mill multures.  The wages of men ser-
vants are from 4 L. 10 s. to 6 L. 10 s., or 7 L.;-of women fer-
vants, from 2 L. to 3 L. per annum;-of day labourers, 6 d.
with maintainance.  There are few day-labourers, as it is only
at some seasons of the year that they could find employment
from the farmers.  Reapers are hired for the harverst, the
men at 2 L. and the women at 1 L.

   Roads.-Aberdeen is the nearest sea port, being 25 L. miles
