     Statistical Account

in these districts.  Every farm in the parish having a
share of the shore, except 4 small ones, is of great con-
sequence, not only as to fishing, but for the easy pro-
curing of sea-ware and shell, and which are the general 
manures of the parish.  The cattle also, in winter and 
spring, go to the shores and eat sea-ware, which is no
small advantage in times of snow.  But the parish la-
bours under many disadvantages.  There are no bridges
and no roads, except what is made in Ross by the sta-
tute-labour.  This is a misfortune that is severely felt,
both by the inhabitants and by strangers.  This, and
the want of stage-houses upon the road, makes travel-
ling disagreeable and often dangerous.  The residing
heritors have made some enclosures upon the farms
where they reside; the rest of the parish is open, ex-
cept the Duke of Argyll's property, where some farms
are nearly enclosed, and something done upon all of
them.  This want of enclosures makes herding very ex-
pensive to the tenant, and hurtful to the castle, as they
are often hounded with dogs, and cannot pasture at ease.
It is true, some farms in the parish cannot be enclosed,
but at an enormous expense; but these are few in 
number.  The parish being out of the track of shipping,
and in a manner sequestered from the rest of Mull by
high mountains, except one pass through Glenmore,
leading to Torasay, (and even this, without a road or
bridge) is severely felt.

   Languages.-The language spoken in the parish is
Gaelic, which was reckoned very pure, by its vicinity
to I.  By the schools in the parish, some of the natives
speak the English; and such as serve in the Low Coun-
try speak the dialect of the places where they serve.
