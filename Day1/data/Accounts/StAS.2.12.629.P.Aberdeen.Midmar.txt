the agriculture is, on the whole, equally advanced with that in the
neighbourhood.  There is neither inn nor alehouse in the parish.
Our greatest reproach is the quantity of land unimproved or un-
planted, and the state of the roads.  These have been of late
somewhat improved, but still they are worse than those in any
other parish within the district

                      PARISH OF MIDMAR.

      PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE O'NEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

              THE REV. GEORGE COOK, MINISTER.*

           I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundaries, &c.-THE name of this parish appears to
be derived from the Saxon word Mid, and the Gaelic word Marr,
signifying a black forest.
   Extent, &c.-The parish is nearly 7 miles long from east to
west, and about 5 1/2 broad from south to north, in some places,
and in others not above 4 1/2.  It is bounded on the cast by the pa-
rish of Echt; on the south, by Banchory Ternan and Kincar-
dine O'Neil; on the west, by Lumphanan and Cluny and by
Cluny on the north.
   Topographical Appearances, &c.-The surface of the parish is
very uneven, being elevated into two hill ridges, and of course de-
pressed by their accompanying vales.  Between the ridges flow
rills or small burns from west to east, The ridges are of so gen-
tle acclivity as to offer no obstacle to the plough from the bottom to
the summit, and, if properly tilled, produce very fair crops, both
green and white, unless where the soil is so thin as not to admit
of ploughing.  In that case it is planted with Scotch firs, which
thrive better than could well be expected, from such meagre ma-
terial, add considerably to the beauty of the country, afford shel-
ter for the cattle, and tend considerably to improve the climate.
These ridges slope to a level as they proceed towards, the west end
