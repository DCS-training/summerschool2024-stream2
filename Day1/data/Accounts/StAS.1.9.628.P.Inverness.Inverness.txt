with melancholy and dejection of heart.-But however
beneficial this canal would ultimately prove to Britain,
yet the trade on it can hardly be supposed to arrive for
years to come at that degree of importance, which ought
to induce private persons to subscribe for executing the
work.  Happily Government looks not in their projects
