   Fisheries.-As to fisheries, (in which the inhabitants of
Greenock, justly considering them as a principal source of
their wealth, have been much interested,) it may be pro-
per to mention, that in the reign of Charles II. and under
the patronage of the Duke of York, a society of Herring
Fishers was established on the Clyde, with particular privi-
leges.  At the east end of the town of Greenock, in 1676,
they inclosed a large piece of ground, which they called
the Royal Close, (the name which it still retains,) for the
purpose of curing herrings.  The Company was afterwards
dissolved, and the buildings of the Close, which belong to
the city of Glasgow, have been long occupied as storehouses
for tobacco.
   The herring fishery, however, was continued by indivi-
duals, and not without success, in boats on the river and
neighbouring lochs, and in larger vessels to the Isles.  The
Society of the Free British Fishery, being established by act
of Parliament, in the year 1750, they granted a bounty to
herring fishers, of 30 s. per ton, which, in 1757, they ex-
tended to 50 s.; and, in 1771, with some other alterations,
reduced to 30 s.  On the bounty last year, (1791,) were 
cleared at the Custom-house, Greenock, and outports,
129 busses, on board 88 of which were 938 men.  Besides
large quantities of herrings, caught in the river and neigh-
bouring lochs, which were sold for immediate consump-
tion, there were entered, from the 5th of January 1791 to 
the 5th of January 1792,         Bar.Her.
