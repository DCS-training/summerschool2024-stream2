east, form the natural boundaries of the parish; and it lies
contiguous to Denny on the east, and Campsie on the west,
to Fintry and St. Ninians on the north, and Kirkintulloch
and Cumbernauld on the south.  I never saw a separate map
of the whole.  But there is a very elegant beautiful and cor-
rect plan of the estate of Kilsyth, in the possession of the pro-
prietor.  And in the map of Stirlingshire, in Atlas Blaviana,
there is a very minute and pretty accurate delineation of this
parish.
   The general appearance of the whole to a stranger is ra-
ther bare and bleak.  A child may number the trees; but
there are a few small copse woods.  The east barony has
very much the appearance of a highland district or strath.
Even the west is very uneven in its surface, and much in
want of planting and proper inclosures.  There is not a
strip of planting in the parish.  It forms altogether an ex-
tended strath between two lines of hills; in so much, that
at one point, it seems to be part of a great ditch, intersecting
the kingdom, terminating at the Frith of Forth on the east,
and Clyde on the west; being at nearly equal distances
from either.  It sends several streams to both.  For near
the centre of the parish is the summit or highest part of
the whole strath, from whence issues the Kelvin, running west,
and Auchencloch burn running east.  The Dullatur bog,
through which they both run, is almost on a level with the
water in tile great canal, which cuts it into almost equal parts.
And the canal is at that place 160 feet above the level of
the Forth, at Grangemouth.
   Though the surface of this parish is rough, broken, and
uneven, being almost an uninterrupted succession of hill and
dale, yet we have no mountains of any note.  The highest
form a part of that ridge which rises at Greenock, runs
through Kilpatrick, Baldernock, Campsie, Kilsyth, and
