   Birds of Passage, Sea-Fowl, etc.-There are only two
birds of passage, the woodcock and the dotterel, ever seen
here; the first frequents the woods, and are few in number
the second appear in vast numbers on the heights.  They
both arrive in the spring, and are seldom seen here after the
month of June.  There is also a prodigious number of sea-
sowls, known by the names of scouts and kitty wakes, with at
mixture of sea-gulls, that arrive in the spring yearly, upon
the high and inaccessible rocks on the south side of St. Abb's
Head.  They breed incredible numbers of young; and about:
the end of May, when the young are paid to be ripe, but be-
fore they can fly, the gentlemen in the neighbourhood find
excellent sport by going out in boats, and shooting great num-
bers of them; when they are killed or wounded, they fall
from the rocks into the sea, and the rowers haul them into
their boatsú Their eggs are pretty good, but their flesh is ve-
ry bad; yet the poor people eat them.  They leave the rocks
about harvest; and none of them are ever seen here before the
next spring.  Where they go to in winter, nobody knows.

   Antiquities.-There are the remains of a church, or chapel
of case, on the heights of St. Abb's Head.  Part of the side-
walls are still standing upright*.
