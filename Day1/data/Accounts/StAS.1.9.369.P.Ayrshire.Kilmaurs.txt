vious, that the great design of the Noble family: this
erection, was to bring together into one place a many
trades people as possible, and that the seuing of these lands
was meant as an encouragement and help to such: but it
has all along produced a contrary effect.  Six acres of land
was the share which fell to each of these 40 feuars or tene-
menters, as they are called, the cultivation of which is no
more than proper exercise and amusement for a man
whose employment is sedentary, and which, with his la-
bour otherwise, would enable him to live in some degree
of comfort.  But it is the misfortune of most men, to have
a greater liking for employments that are foreign to them,
than for those which they have been bred up to follow;
hence, the tenementers of Kilmaurs did abandon their
principal business, and content themselves with the pro-
0duce of their small bit of ground.  This burgh land is fa-
mous for having served Galloway, Nithsdale, Clydesdale,
and all Ayrshire, with kail plants; and it was the demand
for them that turned the attention of the proprietors so
much to the cultivation of their little spots; but that de-
mand has long ceased, other countries having learnt to raise
this article for themselves.  There is not in the county
better land, but it labours under this disadvantage of being
runridge.  In this case inclosures are impracticable, except
where good sense has prevailed in bringing about an exchange
of property, and it is hoped, that the beneficial consequences
of the few instances of this that have happened, will open
the eyes of those who are blinded by prejudice and custom.
The number of portioners is now less than when the char-
ter was granted, several of the fortieth parts having been
sold and laid together by one purchaser, and it is probable,
that they will all in time become an united property; a
circumstance not to be regreted, seeing, that under such a
division, all trade is neglected, and a very scanty subsistence
