that deserves particular notice. It is a magnificent mansion in
the old English style. The design was furnished by Mr Hamil-
ton of Glasgow. It stands in a beautifully sequestered situation,
on the banks of the small stream which separates this parish from
Stewarton.

	The population in the month of August 1835 was 1157, of
whom 572 were males, and 585 females. The demand for la-
bourers in consequence of agricultural improvements, is the chief
cause of the increase of population which has so long been going
on steadily. During last summer, the building of Dunlop House
and the church, also caused a temporary increase of the population.

number of proprietors of land, of the yearly value of L. 50 and
upwards, is 37, of whom 23 are resident. The total number of
heritors is 54.

<FOOTNOTE>
         *As the registration of births is scarcely ever neglected here, the statement with
regard to their average number may be considers very nearly correct.--It often
happens that only one of the parties proclaimed resides in the parish. In the above
estimate, two such proclamations are considered equivalent to one marriage.--As no
register of deaths is kept, their number cannot be exactly stated. The yearly rate
of mortality for the three years and a half, during which the writer has resided in
Dunlop, is 22. This is probably somewhat less than the average of a longer period
would be, as there has till lately been comparatively little sickness in the parish.
