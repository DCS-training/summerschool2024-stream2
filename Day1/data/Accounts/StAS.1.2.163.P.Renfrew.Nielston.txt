It is well known in many of the manufacturing districts, that
when wages are high, many of the operative tradesmen are i-

many of them, who earn, by constant industry, about 7 s per
week, often bring up creditable families, without contracting
debt, giving their children wholesome food, decent clothes, and
ordinary school education; while others, who gain almost thrice
that sum, have scarcely common credit.  The reasons are ob-

of commodities brought from two of the most distant parts of
the globe, and every subsequent repast is proportionally ex-
pensive, large debts, and an incapacity to pay them, are the ne-

can content himself with simple fare, may bring his goods to
the different market towns of Europe, and transport them e-

such modes of living are practised.  The observations also of a
late judicious philosopher * is daily verified, that, in every
country through which he had travelled, where manufactures
flourished, he observed that beggars abounded; and should
poors rates, from this cause, become necessary, and universal
