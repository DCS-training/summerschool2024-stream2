pound of deduction of rent, had no small effect in regu-
lating the price of that article, and keeping it within the
reach of the poor that year.  For many years past cattle
have been the most profitable part of the farmers stock and
the staple commodity of the parish.  The number of black
cattle, annually reared in the parish, is supposed to exceed
what it was 40 years ago, in the proportion of 3 to 1.  Tur-
nip and sown grass, which are more commonly applied to
rearing for the drover and grasier, than feeding for the but-
cher, together with a greater demand from the English mar-
ket have been chiefly instrumental in promoting the breed-
ing of young cattle.  The parish can spare from 300 to 400
yearly.  Though the breed, both with respect to size and the
quality of wool, is much improved, the number of sheep,
kept at present in the parish, is perhaps not above one sixth
of the number which it contained half a century ago.
   The breeding of cattle, and particularly horses, would be
carried to greater perfection, and attended with more profit,
were the fields more generally inclosed.  Though it can boast
of producing many excellent draught and saddle horses, yet
a great part of these, used in the parishs is brought from other
parts of the country.
   By a stronger breed of horses, and a more improved con-
struction of ploughs, carts, and other implements of agri-
culture, its operations are now greatly facilitated, and the
increasing price of labour in some measure compensated.
