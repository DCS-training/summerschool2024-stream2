were forty years ago, and have improved even within the last ten years.
A very great improvement has also taken place in the houses of the
tenantry, but, with a few exceptions near Blairquhan and Berbeth,
and among the feuars in Patna, there has been no improvement in
the accommodation of the labourers, and mechanics, and cotmen.
Straiton is still a neat, clean, and regular village, but some houses,
which forty years ago contained only one family, now contain two,
and the houses are not now in such order as when recently built.
The proprietors are averse to grant feus, or to build houses them-
selves, and there has been in consequence a demand for dwellings
beyond the supply. The increase of population has arisen from
the improvements in agriculture in all parts of the parish, and
from the coal and lime having been wrought more extensively at
Patna.
