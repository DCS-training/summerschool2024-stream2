small river called Fiddich; on the N. by the parish of
Rothes, from which it is separated by the river Spey;
on the N W. by the parish of Knockandow, from which
it is also separated by the river Spey; and on the W.
and S.W. by the parish of Inveraven, from which it is
divided by a hill called the Drum of Carron, the small
water of Tarvey, and the hill of Allachoynachan, upon
which the battle between the Earls of Argyle and Huntly,
comonly called the battle of Glenlivat was fought.
The appearance of the parish is various; that part of it
which lies N. W. N. and E. and runs along Spey and Fid-
dich is flat; that which lies toward the S E. and
S W. is hilly.  In the middle of the parish stands the
high mountain of Belrinnes, from the top of which you
can, in a clear day, see as far as S. as the Grampian hills and
as far as N. and E. as the mountains of Ross, Sutherland and
Caithness.  The soil towards the river is light, and when
you dig to any depth, a stratum of land.  That which is
towards the hills is deep and clay bottom.  But both the
one and the other are abundantly fruitful when properly
clutivated.

   Rivers, etc.- Besides the Spey and Fiddich, there are
a good number of small rivulets or burns, which abound
with trout and eel,as do Spey and Fiddich; in the for-
mer of which considerable numbers of salmon used to be
caught; and for liberty of catching them with rods,
dikes or cairns, the tenants, along the river-side, paid to
their respective heritors a certain yearly rent, which was
called water-rent.  But, of late years, the quantity of sal-
mon caught within the bounds of this parish is greatly di-
minished, in consequence of a process between the Duke of
Gordon and the upper heritors, wherein it was found,
that the Duke had a title to raise cruises across the river,
