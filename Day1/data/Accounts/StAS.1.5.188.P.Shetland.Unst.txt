     Statistical Account

   spring 1784, 570 cattle died for want of food, of which 280,
were milk cows.  The horses are well known for their 
small size and hardiness.  They are called sbelties in Bri-
tainl.  Though they measure only from 9 th 11 hands
high, they are fit for riding, and all the ordinary services
of husbandry, and are nor frequently used in noblemen's
and gentlemen's carriages.  Of these there may be nearly
1000 in the island.  But numbers of them die in severe
winters, as they never enjoy the protection of a stable.
The sheep weigh usually at full growth, from 30 lb. to 40 lb.
each, and are covered with fleeces of the very finest of
wool.  The mutton of Unft, Fetlar, and Dunroffness, is
esteemed the best in the country.  The whole stock of
sheep in this island having been lately numbered, in order 
to ascertain the value of the teind, was fount to amount to
6600.  A severe winter has, since, however, destroyed a-
bout a third of that number, Hogs abound also in consi-
derable numbers, and weigh fro 60 to 100 lb. each.
They afford hams that are excellent, when properly cured.
The dogs are of the common our kind, and the cats
often desert the house and live wild among the rocks.
Rabbits are more numerous in the islets of Balta and Hu-
nie, (appendages of Unft,) than in any other part of Shet-
land, of equal extent.  Rats, mice, frogs, toads, and adders
are unknown here.  Otters and seals are the only amphi-
bious animals to be found on these shores.  The seals breed
in the caves above mentioned, and are found in great num-
bers on the shores of Uya, Haffgruna, Weatherholm, and 
Burra-firth.  The otters are still more numerous.  But nei-
ther are now found in the same abundance as formerly.

   Birds.-  The tame sowls are greese, ducks, pigeons,
dunghill fowls, and a few turkies.  The wild land fowls
are plovers, pigeons, curlews, (commonly called whaap)
