island, to which they enter by stepping-stones from the main-
land.  Here tradition says that the courts of justice were
kept; and from this the island was called the Lawtaing.  One
custom they had is worth mentioning: That if any person
was condemned to suffer punishment for any crime, the sen-
tence was intimated to him by the court; and as only the
members of the court and the parties were admitted into the
Lawtaing, those remotely concerned, and the idle spectators,
stood on the banks of the lake.  It was allowed to the con-
demned criminal to endeavour to make his escape to the kirk
of Tingwall; his way led through the crowd of spectators;
and if he effected his escape, either by their favouring his
cause, or by superior swiftness or strength, and reached the
kirk, he was on that account freed from the punishment.
This was a kind of appeal to the people from the sentence of
the judge.
   This valley extends two miles N. E. from Tingwall, where
it is terminated by the Voe of Laxforth, a very safe harbour;
but as there is no trade here, it is never frequented.
   Through all this valley there is great plenty of good lime-
stone, of a bluish colour, yielding a fine white lime.  Some
very imperfect attempts have been made to manure the
ground with it; but as the ground never is ley above one
year, and is never fallowed, it cannot be expected that lime
will do it much service.
