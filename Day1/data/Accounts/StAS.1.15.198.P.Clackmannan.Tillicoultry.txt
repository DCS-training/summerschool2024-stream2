     Statistical Account

tacksmen of the coal for more than a year and a half, but
have wrought none, except a very small quantity for land
sale.  The design of taking a coal, without working it, is in-
comprehensible.  While coals remain under ground, they are
of no value, either to the proprietor or the tacksmen.

   Gate Mail.-The great coal, when led to the shore of
Alloa for exportation, pays a tax of fourpence Sterling per
chalder to the family of Mar, called Gate Mail.  It was origi-
nally demanded, for the liberty of exporting the coal from
the Pow of Alloa, and because the road leading through the
estate so the harbour was a private one, though used by the
public.  This road is repaired by Mr Erskine at a consider-
able annual expence; at the same time it seems extraordi-
nary, that there is not a public road leading from Tillicoul-
try to a public harbour, and to a market town, in which a
custom-house is established by authority.

   River, Floods, Fish, Pearls, Swans, etc,-The Devon is
a beautiful river, but not navigable.  After running in the
Ochils about 8 miles in an easterly direction from its source,
it makes a wide circuit round Muckart.  Then taking a
westerly course at the Crook, and forming the romantic fall
at the Caldron Lin, it divides the arable land of Tillicoultry,
into two almost equal parts.  The valley, through which it
passes, is distinguished by Newte in his Tour, as being one of
the most pleasant places, or, as he expresses it, the Tempe of
Scotland.  The Devon frequently swells with rain, and o-
verflows its banks++.  It abounds with excellent trout

++ A very remarkable and uncommon flood happened in September 1785,
which carried away a prodigious quantity of corn, broke down a stone bridge
at the Rack mill in Dollar, and occasioned other very extraordinary damage.
