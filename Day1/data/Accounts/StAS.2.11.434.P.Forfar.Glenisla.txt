mon. Several of these allotments in the lower district are already
covered with thriving plantations. This is one of the good ef-
fects of the division of commons, which, it is to be hoped, will in a
few years be more generally observed in the parish: while the im-
provement of live-stock, and an additional quantity of land under
tillage, are other results from the same cause, which may pretty
confidently be anticipated.
	It is matter of regret that neither the advantages of their in-
dustry, nor the benefits of public worship, have, hitherto, been suf-
ficiently enjoyed by the people here, from the want of a proper
line of road to connect the upper and the lower districts with each
other. The present line, which crosses the bill of Kilry, is, from
its steepness, always inconvenient, and in winter storms, from its
great elevation, frequently impassable. It was lately proposed to
abandon this road for one that should communicate with Strath-
more by the eastern base of Kilry, and be connected by a bridge,
near the church, with the road from Kirriemuir to Braemar, al-
ready noticed in this report. With respect to the economy and
industry of the parirh, this would be an improvement of the great-
est consequence, while, by rendering Glenisla an easy channel of
communication between Newtyle and the north of Scotland, it
would, in a public point of view, be of no small importance.
