   Mineral Spring and Minerals.-This parish being a hilly
country, abounds with springs of fine water, many of them
mineral.  But there is one called Shalloch-well, which has
deservedly the pre-eminence.  The virtues of this water are
well known in this country; it is a pretty strong chalybeate,
and partakes of the sulphur also to no inconsiderable degree.
About 30 years ago, people of the first rank and fashion in
Carrick and the neighbourhood, attended this well; but this
is not the case at present; every season, however, produces
some company, and the waters have been rarely known to fail
in giving relief to persons afflicted with stomachic or scorbutic
disorders.  The reason why this water is in a great measure
deserted, is the want of proper accommodation at the well.
There is freestone in the parish, and abundance of limestone.
No coal has yet been found in it; and through want of a road
to the coal-pit, on the water of Girvan, the inhabitants are ne-
cessitated to depend principally upon turf and peat for fuel.
It is supposed that this, like many high countries, possesses
valuable minerals; for certain, there is lead in it; but the trial,
properly speaking, has never been made (though once at-
tempted) to find out whether it would be to the advantage of
the proprietor to follow after this valuable article.

   Climate.-The climate is not by any means unfavourable to
health.  The parish is extensive; the inhabitants sparse, and
families living at a distance from each other, contribute much
to the salubrity of the place.  There is a village at the parish
church, but it does not contain above 86 inhabitants, old and
young.  An eminent surgeon in this neighbourhood, now some
years dead, who practised in this country near 50 years, was
in use to observe, that in all that time he never knew an epi-
demical distemper in this parish.  There have been many in-
stances of longevity in the parish, of people living considerably
