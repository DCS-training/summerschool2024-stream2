     of Glasgow.

   From this table it may be remarked, that the city of
Glasgow has been gradually increasing, but more remark-
ably since the Union of the two kingdoms, though most
of all within the last 20 years.  In making calculations,
however, from these tables, it should be observed, that the
list of baptisms for a considerable number of years past, is
supposed to be considerably less than the truth, for the fol-
lowing reasons:  That, about the year 1738, the unfortunate
separation from the Church took place, which is known
by the name of the Secession.  This party carried away a
considerable number of the inhabitants to a society by them-
selves; a very able and respectable clergyman presided in
their meeting; they were at variance with the Establish-
ed Church, and, fond of considering themselves as the
Church of Scotland, they not only declined registrating their
childrens names in the common manner, but they opened
separate registers, as well as separate chuches.  This sepa-
ration still continues, and must, therefore, in a considerable
degree, affect the register of baptisms, not only in this, but
in every other place where the Sucession has taken root.
Another cause, which tends to lessen the number, is, that
some of the inhabitants, not of the lowest rank, have of late
years omitted the registration of their children's names,
through inattention.  In order, however, to assist any cal-
culations in this matter, the result is subjoined of three dif-
ferent numerations which have been taken of the inhabi-
tants.  The first is the numeration procured by Dr Web-
ster about 1734, when he was making his calculations
for the widow's fund, which makes the number 18,366;
but in his report made up anno 1755, the population of
Glasgow and its suburbs, is stated at 23,546 souls.  The
other two were taken under the authority of the Magi-
strates, and done with precision and accuracy; though it
must be observed, that all these only relate to the royalty,
