                       V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   Markets.-The-parish has no market-town within its bounds
nor is its tranquillity disturbed by any periodical fairs.  At one
time it was the seat of a regular cattle-market, but that has been
discontinued for a considerable period.  The nearest outlet for the
agricultural produce of the district is Edinburgh, which is seven
miles and a-half distant from the church.
   Villages.-The principal village in the parish is Ratho.  It is
pleasantly situated upon a sloping declivity on the east side of the
ridge which we have described as traversing the parish. It con-
sists of a single street, with two rows of houses running from west
to east, and bending at a right angle northward to the Union Ca-
nal.  The latter part of this street was anciently called the Lud Gate
or Lord's Gate, from its forming the way of access to the House
of God.  The houses are chiefly one storey in height; they-are built
of whinstone from the quarries in the neighbourhood, with free-
stone lintels, and some are roofed with tiles, and others with slates.
The village has been much extended and improved of late years by
the erection of a number of neat cottages, and by the formation of
dry drains and other alternations upon the street.  A few very old huts
on the south side, which still connect the present village with the
olden time, are now in process of demolition, and their place will no
doubt in time be supplied by others of more commodious structure.
   The only other village now belonging to the parish is that of
Bonnington, situated about a mile and a-half west of Ratho, on
the table-land of the same ridge.  It consists of about twenty small
thatched houses, inhabited entirely by the labourers and farm-ser-
vants employed upon the estate of Bonnington.  The former Sta-
tistical Account mentions also the village of Norton, of whick no-
thing now remains but four cot-houses.
