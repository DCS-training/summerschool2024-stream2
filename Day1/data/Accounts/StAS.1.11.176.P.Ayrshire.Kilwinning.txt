has done, in agriculture, in commerce, and in manufactures.
Sincere and steady in his friendships, humane and generous,
the patron of unfortunate merit, of the most polished and
agreeable manners, and possessed of all the more amiable and
espectable virtues, the death of the late Earl of Eglintoune
will be long and painfully regretted by every good man, by
every friend of humanity, and of his country*.

   Names Of Places.-Not a few of these, it is said, are ori-
ginally Gaelic; such as, Auchenmade, Auchentyber, Auchen-
winsie, Auchensarvie, Etc.  Other names are evidently English.
Of these, some are descriptive of their particular situations,
as Wood, Wood-side, Wood-end.  Tradition says, that in these
places, there was in former times a very extensive wood; but
there is not the least vestige of it now remaining.  Other
names describe their ancient proprietors; as Smith's-town,
Fergus-hill-hall, Etc.

   Wet and Cold Summers.-It is in the recollection of many
still living, that the summers, in this part of the country at
least, are now much more wet and cold than they were 50
years ago.  By men of undoubted veracity it is asserted, as
an absolutely certain fact, that, at that period, the farmers,
in plowing for bear, about the middle of the month of May,
were under the necessity of beginning to plow so very early
as at 3 o'clock in the morning, and to leave off at 8.  The
heat, at that hour, became so very intense, that it was impos-
sible for them to continue their; work any longer:  Nor could
they begin again till between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
