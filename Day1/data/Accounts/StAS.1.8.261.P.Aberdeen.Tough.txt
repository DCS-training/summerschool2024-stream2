     NUMBER XIII.

     PARISH OF TOUGH.

     (County and Synod of Aberdeen.-Presbytery of Alford.)

     By Mr. ALEXANDER URQUHART.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THERE is no tradition, nor any record, that this parish
has had any other name than its present one.  It is
pretty evident, that it is of Gaelic extraction.  Those skill'd
in that language say, that it signifies Northward, or a place
with a northern exposure, which is the more probable as
there is a range of hills, which run from the south east to the
south west corner of the parish, and which screen it from the
south and south west.  It is said, that Towie, the name of a
neighbouring parish, has the same signification, for which the
same reason may, with much propriety, be assigned.  Both
names are pronounced in the Gaelic, with somewhat of a gut-
tural sound, as if they were written Toua.  The names of
many of the farm towns are purely Gaelic.  The parish is
about 22 miles distant from Aberdeen.  Its length from S.
to N. is about 5 miles, and its greatest breadth about 3.  Its
form would be almost triangular, did not a considerable part
