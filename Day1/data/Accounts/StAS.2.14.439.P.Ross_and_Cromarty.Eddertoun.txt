  Wood.-At Easter Fearn, there once existed an extensive oak
and birch wood, which extended from the top of Struie Hill to the
shore.  Tradition relates that the whole was purchased, early in the
seventeenth century, by two brothers from England, who got it cut
down and manufactured into charcoal.  The place still retains the
name of Meike Wood, and is now covered with brusbwood to a
considerable extent.  At Wester Fearn, on the estate of Balnagown,
there is a fine plantation of Scotch fir, chiefly old trees, covering
an extent of nearly 100 acres.  At Mid-Fearn, on the Sutherland
estate, there is a natural wood of birch of 60 acres, and a
planted wood of fir, birch, oak, &c. of the same extent.  There
was also a fir wood of 781/2 acres on the hill of Eddertoun, which
was on the estate of Cadboll, and was sold in 1838 for L.680
terling.  It is now nearly cut down, but is to be replanted
whenever the ground is cleared of the old wood.
  The soil here, in its present state, is beat adapted for Scotch
firs and larches, of which there are considerable plantations in the
parish, as mentioned above, and two on the BaInagown property.
