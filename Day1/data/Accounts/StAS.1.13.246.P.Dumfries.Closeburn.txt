tion, date, coats of arms, ornaments or figures, that can lead
to any probable conjecture, as to the time of its being
built.  But from the style of building, it is supposed to be
about 800 years old.  A particular description and draw-
ing of this castle, together with an account of the ancient
and present families possessing it, may be seen in Mr Grose's
Antiquities of Scotland.  Upon the farm of Kirkpatrick
in this parish, there are the remains of an old chapel and
burying ground; and upon the farm of Auchencairn,
there are the remains of an old vaulted building.  But no
traditionary account with respect to either of these, has
been transmitted down to the present age.  There are
likewise, in different parts of the parish, several large cairns
of stones heaped together.  But neither is there any tradi-
tion with respect to them.

   Loch and Mineral Wells.-The castle of Closeburn was
surrounded by a fosse, which was connected with a loch of
nearly a quarter of a mile in length.  In this loch, there
was a remarkable agitation in the year 1756, of which an
account is given in the Philosophical Transactions of that
year.  At a small distance from the castle of Closeburn,
there is a mineral well, which was once of considerable re-
pute.  Its water is sulphureous, and has often been of ser-
vice in serofulous cases.  There is another of the same
kind in the Duke of Queensberry's lands of Lockerben;
and there is another mineral well of a different kind,
known by the name of the Town Cleugh Well.  It is
pretty strongly impregnated with iron, and its name points
out its situation.  The Cleugh, where it is, is called the
Town Cleugh, from its vicinity to a small village called
Closeburn Town, of which the only remains now are a
part of the Cross, which is not yet totally destroyed.
