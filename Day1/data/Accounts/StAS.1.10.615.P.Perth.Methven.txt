     of Methven.

To which is added, the annual interest of 267 L. bequeathed, 
at different times, to the poor of the parish.  There are 9
districts, whose householders collect the proportions by rota-
tion, and give them to the schoolmaster, (the treasurer and
clerk of the fund,) who makes a weekly distribution, com-
monly after divine service.  In 1775, the number of poor,
on the stated list, was 36, who received weekly 1 L. 10 s. 2 d.
The heritors and householders meet twice a year, and fix
the assessment for the ensuing half year.  The session have
also power from the heritors to expend, on occasional poor,
the whole of the weekly collections, etc. which amount to
about 18 l. per annum :  And the late Dr OSWALD be-
to such householders, as the session know to need a tempo-
rary relief, but who do not receive regular supplies from the
assessed funds of the parish.  This surely is a well judged
charity .
