that, in 1606, a considerable part of the land originally belonging
to the monastery was resumed by the Crown, and annexed to the
Chapel Royal of Stirling. That the whole lands were not resumed
is manifest, because the park in which the ruin is situated, and an-
other, adjoining to it, still called the Provost's Park, have for more,
than a century and a half belonged to the proprietors of the barony
(See Farmers' Magazine for March 1811.)  Very little is known about
this religious establishment, but from the present state of the
building, which is very ruinous, it seems to have been of consider-
able extent, but of very rude workmanship. There are several
rude stones of considerable height erected in different parts of the
county, seemingly intended to mark the burial places of some chief
or officer who had fallen in battle, one of which exists in the pa-
rish, a little to the west of the village of Linton. Tombs, or stone
coffins, have been found by the ploughmen in several places, mark-
ing the site of a field of battle.
   Modern Buildings.-Smeaton House, the residence of Sir Tho-
mas Hepburn, is the only mansion house in the parish. There is
indeed one at Beanston, belonging to the Earl of Wemyss, but it
has been uninhabited for several years, and will soon be in ruins.
There are in the parish four oatmeal and barley mills, one flour
mill, one exclusively for barley, and one connected with a distillery.
The distillery employs 50 men, is capable of distilling 500,000
gallons per annum, and pays L. 112,000 of duty.

          In 1755, the amount of the population was       1318
             1792,                              was only, 1176
             1811,                                        1471
             1821,                                        1812
             1831,                                        1765

   The causes of the diminution which has taken place since 1821
are probably these; 1st, In some farms where new leases have
been granted in that period, several old houses have been pulled
down which were not required to afford labourers for the farms, while
in some instances two or more farms have been united, and con-
sequently the number of inhabitants diminished. 2d, In 1821, there
was an academy kept by the Dissenting clergyman, which has since
been given up, causing a diminution of twelve or fifteen.
   The population in the village and the country part of the parish
is as follows:
