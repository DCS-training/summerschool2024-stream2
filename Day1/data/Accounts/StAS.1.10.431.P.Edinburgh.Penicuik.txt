the raised work appears to have been occasioned by the im-

   Miscellaneous Observations.-On the N. side of the Linton
road, on an eminence between it and the hills about the 10th
mile stone from Edinburgh, are the remains of an oval camp
84 by 67 yards within, inclosing a number of tumuli 11 yards
each in diameter.  It has three entries, one to the W. and
one on each side to the N. and S. but none at the end to the
E. The N. entrance is 6 and the other two 4 yards each in
width.  It is encompassed by two ditches, each 4 yards wide,
with a mound of 6 yards in breadth between them; and the
name it usually gets among the country people is the Castle.
There is a similar encampment at the side of the Harkin-

of British origin, constructed either for the protection of
cattle or for defence in war.  In Tweeddale such entrench-
ments, of which there are several of various dimensions, are
known by the appellation of Rings.
   From inattention to the unevenness of the surface, the
turnpike roads are full of pulls, and are extremely fatiguing
and irksome to travellers; the bye roads are also few, and in
very bad repair.  The great objection to the old roads, are,
that they are ill conducted, ill made, and narrow.  To every
person of sense it must appear obvious, that till a road is ren-
dered easy and accessible, it would be absurd and foolish in
the extreme to waste and squander the money of the public
on improvements, which would be comparatively of little
consequence; the first object, therefore, ought to be to re-
move the pulls, and flatten the road as much as possible, so as to
render travelling easy and expeditious, then to make and
keep it in repair, and last of all to make it wide and hand-
some.  When the road is finished across the hills, one of the
