made it necessary to give away both stock and income.  For
5 years successively, beginning with 1782, the crops almost
wholly failed, and above 100 poor persons came upon the ses-

failure of crop better than Zetland, if the sea continues to
render its supplies, particularly when the small fry of seth or
cole fish fill the bays in their usual abundance; but from
1781 to 1787, the sea, as well as the land, withheld its usual
products.  These circumstances were attended with a great
murrain and mortality among the sheep and cattle.  In this

Grutness, and West Voes, which lie on each side of Sum-
burgh Head, separated by a neck of land.  In Lerwick
Sound, ships anchor and ride securely, as they do also in
Aithsvoe of Cunningsburgh.  On the Fair Isle in this mini-
stry, the flag ship of the Spanish Armada was wrecked in
1588; and the Duke of Medina Celi resided for some time in
the house of Quendal.
   There are no manufactures here, unless for domestic use,
viz. blankets and coarse cloth, excepting, perhaps, some
stockings, gloves, and garters, sold to the Dutch fishers.  A
linen manufacture was attempted here some years ago by the
gentlemen of the country, and a considerable sum of money
was expended, but the adventure came to nothing: For its
