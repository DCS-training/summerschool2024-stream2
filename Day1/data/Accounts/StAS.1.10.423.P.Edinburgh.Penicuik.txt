     of Pennycuick.

   Church and Poor.-The church is a neat handsome build-
ing, at the east end of the village, with a portico supported
by 4 doric pillars; on the top of which is a figure of a cross
in stone, that occasioned some uneasiness, at the time of its
erection, to the enemies of popery.  There is on the front
of the portico the word Bethel well cut in Hebrew charac-
ters, which likewise gave some offence.  It was built in 1771,
before the cotton mill, and, on that account, is now too small
for the parish.  Sir John Clerk of Pennycuick is patron.  Mr
Thomas M'Courty, formerly minister of Dolphington, was
admitted here, 17th January 1772.  The stipend is 781 3 s.
6 1/2 d. all paid in money, besides a manse and glebe worth
about 10 L. or 12 L. per annum.  There are now 21 poor persons
upon the session roll, but often many more.  They are sup-
ported from the interest of some money belonging to the ses-
sion, by the hire of a hearse, and of a mortcloth, and by
the weekly collections at the church door, extending all at
a medium to about 28 L. per annum; but amounting, for-
merly, to a larger sum, when the family resided constantly
at Pennycuick House.

   Villages, Inns, and Roads.-There is only one village in the
parish; the new part of which, at a little distance from the
old, was built to accommodate the people belonging to the
cotton mill.  There is a neat small inn about the middle of
the old town, which was a good deal frequented by parties
of pleasure, from Edinburgh, in summer, to see the House of
Pennycuick, and its fine paintings, particularly Ossian's Hall,
and the pleasure ground around the house.  It must be ob-
served that there are too many dram shops, to which the peo-
ple often resort, and are in danger of destroying themselves
by taking too much of that poisonous liquor, cheap whisky,
by which both their health and morals are greatly injured, and
