by the village, which takes its rise from the springs in the moun-
tains to the N. and N. W. In summer, this stream is very
small, and hardly affords water enough to work the mills that
depend upon it; but in winter, it is full of water, and by
heavy showers often overflows its banks, and lays a great part
of the lands in the before-mentioned level under water, to the
great hurt of the crops both of corn and grass.  The same may
be laid of the water of Deskry, over which is a stone bridge
of one arch built, at Rippachy, on the highway from Strath-
don to Aberdeen, and by which travellers pals by another
public road to Tarland, and through Cromar.  Both these af-
ford no other fish but trout, which, though small is exceeding
good.  The river Don, which runs along that part of the pa-
rish of Tarland in Strathdon@ being there near its source, is
but small in summer.  It abounds with fine trouts, and some-
times salmon are found in it, as far up as Strathdon.  The
mountains all over the country are generally covered with
heath, and afford pretty good pasturage for sheep, and in some
places for young cattle.  They abound with moorfowl, plover,
dottrel foxes, hares, and other game: the common quadru-
peds in the parish are horses, black-cattle, sheep, and some
hogs.

   Population.-With regard to the population of the parishes,
no distinct account can be given, as no register of births, deaths,
or marriages has ever been, or can be exactly kept in them,
owing to the distance of several parts of the united charge
to the place of the minister's residence.  The people of Migvy
or Deskry-side attend religious ordinances at the church of
Towie, and get their children baptised there, as being nearer
to them than Tarland.  They never think of seeking to get a
child's name entered into the parish register; those of Tarland
parish, in Strathdon, are in the same predicament.  As to
