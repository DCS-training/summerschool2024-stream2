     Statistical Account

   The seasons and weather are very variable, and not to
be depended on.  We have little warmth of heat in sum-
mer; autumn is rainy; the winter usually not to severe as
on the continent, by more open, and free of snow and frost.
Our spring is often wet and cold.  Sowing of oats com-
mences here, in a dry spring, with some few individuals, in
the beginning of March, but not in general till about the
middle of April.  Barley is sown from the beginning of
May to the end of June.  Potatoes are planted from the 
middle of April to the 20th day of May.  Harvest gene-
rally begins about the middle of September, and the crop
is not totally got into the barns and barn-yards before No-
vember.

   Diseases.-The only local and peculiar distemper preva-
lent in this parish, is a disorder which seizes new-born in-
fants about the fifth night after their birth, and carries
them off by convulsive fits; but this species of sickness is
become less frequent that it has been heretofore.  Rheu-
matism is often complained of.  Inoculation is performed 
here with success by the skill and attention of Mr. John Mil-
lar, surgeon.
