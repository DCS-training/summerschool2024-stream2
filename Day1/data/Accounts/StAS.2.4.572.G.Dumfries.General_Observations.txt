committee would confer on the nation a most important benefit, by
a total repeal of the malt duties for private consumption of ale and
beer. For the most perfect system of improvement of land con-
sists in barley following turnips eaten off by sheep, and introducing
clovers and other sown grasses with the most advantage; besides
that, in late bad seasons, barley is the only crop that ripens fully,
so as to lessen want and prevent famine: and by allowing the ma-
nufacture of grain in every possible way, spirits excepted, there will
be a liberal use of it for the comforts, the health, and the morals of
the people; and then, when a bad season occurs, the surplus thus
applied in favourable seasons will supply the wants of the year in
the home market, and prevent the necessity of exporting gold in
the purchase of foreign grain; and, by extending the culture
of barley to soils now overdone with wheat, the farmers will
have encouragement for the culture of wheat on proper soils, by
relieving it of the superabundant portion of wheat produce, and
thus will the safety, the comforts, and morals of this country be
all promoted.
	11. It is of importance to consider that the culture of barley is
not only discouraged and oppressed by a malt tax equal to the
value of the grain, but by the apathy or ignorance of the owners of
mills. It is liable when ground into pot-barley or meal to the heavy
dues of about fourpence the bushel, being 10 per cent. of the value
of the grain; and as the offal is commonly kept by the miles for
their own use,--if the barley be made into the finest description
called pearly barley, a very large proportion goes of in working,
which is also retained as part of the dust, though also rich in
meal; and betwixt the heavy malt taxes and mill dues, it is really
suprising that the culture of this best grain of the United King-
dom is continued at all. It would not be continued, if it were not
for the genuine value and importance of a grain so trustworthy
and so favourable to the improvement of the soil; but though it is
continued on a reduced scale, it would extend very much indeed,
if these unnatural and most injudicious restrictions were all taken
off; and landholders, in particular, and all classes would bless the
liberal and wise promoters of this relief, perhaps the most impor-
tant measure that can be adopted for the general good of the
United Kingdom, and for the special benefit of the county of Dum-
fries among others. It would provide for the health, comfort, and
morals of the people, and in a bad season it would secure at home
the grain that must be imported under the present system, and
