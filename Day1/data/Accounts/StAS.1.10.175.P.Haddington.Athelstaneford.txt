   Miscellaneous Observations.-The only antiquities in this pa
rish are the vestige of a camp, seemingly Danish, concerning
which there is no tradition, and history is silent; and the
remains of a chapel, called St John's Chapel, which belonged
to the Knights Templars. These are both on the property
of the Earl of Hopetoun.  The house of Garleton, too, may
be mentioned under this head.  It appears to have been a
place of magnificence, but is now almost in ruins.  It is
beautifully situated at the foot of the Garleton Hills, at the
west end of a large strath of fertile land, and commands a
delightful prospect of a large proportion of the lower lands
of East Lothian.
   There are four alehouses in the parish, but they are at-
tended with no bad consequences either to the health or the
morals of the people; they are, what they ought to be,
places of accommodation for travellers, or for transacting ne-
cessary business, There are two corn-mills; one upon the
estate of Sir David Kinloch, the other upon the property of
the Earl of Hopetoun.  Their respective tenants are thirled
to these mills, which is sometimes complained of as a griev-
ance, but certainly without good reason, since the thirlage
ought to be considered as a part of their rent; at the same
time, it must be confessed, that it would be much better if
every servitude of this kind was done away.  There are three
smiths in the parish, and tradesmen of every kind connected
with the improvements in husbandry.  The prices of labour
and provisions are almost double of what they were 40 years
ago.  This is one of the many other proofs that might be
given of the flourishing state of the country.
   The inhabitants of this parish have been long remarkable
for the liberality of their sentiments in religious matters.
They are exemplary in their attendance upon the ordinances
of religion, and uncommonly decent in their behaviour upon
