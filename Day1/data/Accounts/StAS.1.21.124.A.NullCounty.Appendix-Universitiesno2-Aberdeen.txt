the synod drew up an overture on the same subject, which
they transmitted to the General Assembly of the Church,
under the full conviction that some effectual remedy to the
abuse to which it related, was desirable and necessary.  This

a strict and regular attendance on the Hebrew classes, during
the whole period of their enjoying them.  This recommen-
dation, it is hoped, will be attended with the desired effect.
The class for Hebrew in this University, now meets twice a-
day, for five days in the week, during the whole period of
the session of divinity.  Besides teaching the elements of the
language, and reading the Old Testament with his pupils,
