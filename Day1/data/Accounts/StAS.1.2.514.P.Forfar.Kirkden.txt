some, to have been erected, upon the defeat of the Danes by
Malcolm II. about the fame time with the crofs at Camiston,
in the parish of Monikie, mentioned by Buchhanan.  Near this
obelisk, there was a green hillock, consisting of land and gra-
vel, which was cut away 16 years ago, in straighting the road,
in which some graves were found.  The bones in them were by

   In this parish there are two artificial conical mounts, called
Laws: the law of the barons of Idvie, and that of Gardyne.
The last is now covered with sit trees.  The gallows stood up-

stolen cattle, and immediately judged, condemmed, and hang-
ed, on the Law of Gardyne.  The Law of Idvie has also an
aperture on the top, where probably the gallows stood, or was
occasionally erected, in feudal times
   The castle of Gardyne was built in 1568.  It is firm and
entire.  An addtion, to make it a more commodious dwelling,
has been added in later times.  The castle is romantically si-
tuated, on the brink of a precipice, at the bottom of which,
there is a beautiful plantation of thriving trees, through which
there runs, a purling stream, of the purest water.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is a mineral well in the

are seldom eat by the labourers, even by those on public cha-
rity, excepting in the months of October, November, and 
December.-None, belonging to this parish, stroll a-
