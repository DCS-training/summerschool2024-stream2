     The Statistical Account.

   Boundaries.-Tingwall, Whiteness, and Weisdale, are bound-
ed, on the west, by the united parishes of Sandsting and East-
ing; on the north, by the parishes of Delting and Nesting;
on the northeast, by an inlet of the German Ocean; on the
east, by the town of Lerwick, disjoined from Tingwall in the
year 1701, and erected into a separate parish; on the south-
east, by Sound and Gulberwick, disjoined from Tingwall in
1722, and annexed to the parish of Lerwick; on the south,
by Quarf, a part of the parish of Burray; and on the south-
west, by an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean.

   Extent.-These united parishes extend from N. to S. about
10 miles, and about 7 from E. to W.; but, like the rest of the
Mainland of Shetland, they are so strangely intersected by arms
and inlets of the sea, that in no part of them can a foot be
set down two miles from salt water.  These inlets of the sea
are the voes or bays of Wadbister, Laxforth and Deal, on the
N. and N. E.; and those of Scalloway, Whiteness, Binnaness
and Weisdale, on the W. and S. W.; all of them forming
safe and commodious harbours, especially that of Scalloway.
   The only village in these parishes is Scalloway.  It was for-
merly considered as the chief town of the Shetland Islands.
Some families of distinction lived in it.  It was the residence
of the sheriff-depute, the seat of justice, and consequently the
resort of strangers from the different parts of the country.
Of late it has fallen much into decay.  At present there are
but 31 inhabited houses in it; and the only gentleman of
property, now residing in it, is Mr Scott of Scalloway, who is
almost its sole proprietor.  To the westward of Scalloway
there are four inhabited islands, and several small grazing
holms, making a part of these parishes.
