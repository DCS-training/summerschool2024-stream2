little expence.  They are at hand in many places, easily
worked in the quarry, joined to one another in straight
seams, which makes them easily separable asunder, very
plain and smooth on the surface, straight and plain on the
sides, of a hard and elastic quality, and of a very beau-

their people; and a mighty motive and encouragement to
prompt them to bestow a particular attention on so good
and useful an object.  Pasture ground and meadows are
also in great abundance, very fertile and beautiful, produ-
