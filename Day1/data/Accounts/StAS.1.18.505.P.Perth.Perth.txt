     of Perth.

   "Witnesses, Hugh Chancellor; Philip de Valliams my
"Chamberlain; Malcolm Son of Earl Duncan; William de
"Hay; Alexander Sheriff of Stirling; Roger de Mortimer;
"Philip de Lundin; at Perth, 14th day of April."
   To ascertain the year in which this charter was granted,
it is necessary to make the following remarks concerning the
witnesses.
   1. Philip de Valliams was made great Chamberlain, about
the year 1180.  But he continued in that office about 33
years.
   2. Duncan M'Duff, the father of Malcolm Earl of Fife,
died in 1203.
   3. William de Hay died before the year 1199.
   4. Hugh Roxburgh, Bishop of Glasgow, was made Chan-
cellor of Scotland in 1189, and died, Ides of July, 1199.
   The above charter to Henry Bald must therefore have
been granted betwixt the years 1189, and 1199.

"Goldsmith of Perth, wishes salvation.
   "Know all of you, me to have given and consigned, and
"by this my present charter, to have confirmed, to God, and
"to the church of the Holy Trinity, and of St Michael of
"Scone; and to the abbot and canons serving God, and to
"serve him there; in pure and perpetual alms, my two booths,
"with the gallery placed above them, within the burgh of
"Perth: in that land, which William, of pious memory,
"King of Scots, granted to me for my homage and service.
