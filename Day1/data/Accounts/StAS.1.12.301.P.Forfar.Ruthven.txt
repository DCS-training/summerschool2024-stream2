this parish.  A vein of clay marl, of a red and yellow colour,
was observed here several years ago, and found to answer well
with the dry grounds.  It was afterwards discovered to be a
species of fuller's earth; but the discovery came too late, us
the vein by that time was nearly exhausted.

   Advantageous Situation for Machinery.-At Balbirnie, up-
on the E. side of the river Isla, there is a good situation for a
distillery.  Farther up the river, and on each side of the Lin,
where the corn and waulkmills stand, there are excellent situ-
ations for machinery, where, with little expense, a great bo-
dy of water could be procured during the whole year, to any
necessary height.  There are two other situations for mills,
at present unoccupied.  The one at the bridge on the N. side,
where there was a waulk (or fulling) mill formerly; the o-
ther at a little distance on the S. side of the bridge, where a
lint-mill stood some years ago.  It might be mentioned, that
there would be a capital situation for machinery on the wa-
ter ridge of the glebe, with an excellent freestone quarry,
within 200 yards of it.  What would be greatly in favour of
this situation, is, that the low glebe, consisting of about 10
acres of fine soil, lies directly above the water ridge, is very
level, and might be watered, in every direction, for bleaching
ground, by a small rivulet which never dries up, called the
Kirkton burn.  The abundance of freestone in this parish, its
centrical situation to the manufacturing villages of Cupar An-
gus, Alyth, and Kirriemuir, its moderate distance from the
stourishing town of Dundee, being only 15 miles, and 12 of
these upon a turnpike road; the pleasantness and fertility of
the country, and the reasonable price of provisions added to
the water-falls above mentioned, seem to concur in pointing
out this little parish as a desirable spot for machinery and ma-
nufacture.  Something of this kind is much wanted to quick-
