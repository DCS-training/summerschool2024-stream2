tion, appears to be increasing.  On the most considerable estate
in it, that of Hempriggs, as well as on several others, there are
many well cultivated fields let to tenants, which about a cen-
tary ago were no better than common pasture.  The inhabi-
tants, particularly on the coast and in the burgh of Wick, have
multiplied as the fisheries have become more extended and
successful.  In February 1719, when Mr James Oliphant ob-
tained a decreet for stipend, the inhabitants of the parish were
reckoned to amount to about 4000 souls.  The return to Dr
Webster in 1755 was 3938, and the number has since increas-
ed to at least 5000 young and old.  It is also reasonable to im-
agine that the population will be considerably augmented in
consequence of villages projected on the south and north of
the town; the one by the British Fishing Society already allu-
ded to; and the other now building by tenants of Mr Dun-
bar of Hempriggs, who, in terms of the act for encouraging
agriculture on entailed lands, have taken 99 years leases of
33 acres of excellent land, fit for garden ground, at the rate
of 22 s per acre.  These tenants are bound, on each half
acre, to build a house worth at least 10 pounds.  This village
is called Louisburgh, in compliment to Mrs Dunbar, whose
christian name is Louisa, and it can scarcely fail to prosper
from the many advantages which it possesses.

   The number of families in the burgh of Wick is about
200, and the number of inhabitants about 1000.  The num-
ber of Births in the parish, at an average of 3 years, may a-
mount to about 120 per annum.  Marriages, communibus annis,
run from 27 to 30, but some omit to record either births or
marriages.-The deaths are not recorded, because, in this po-
pulous and very extensive parish, there are no less than se-
ven different burial places, besides the principal one within
the church yard of Wick.-Instances of very great longevity
