     of Liff and Bervie.

   Church, Manse, Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The present
church-fabric, except the aisle, which in every view ought
either to have been raised higher or rebuilt, was erected in
1774, to accomodate the inhabitants, and rests nearly on
the foundation of the former building.  Either the founda-
tions must have given way, or the mason-work been 
slightly executed, as some rents already appear in the
walls.  When the bulk of the inhabitants resided in the
west part of the district, the situation of the church was
then more convenient.  The manse, which is placed a 
little way from the church, is also modern, and was
built about the time when these parishes were united in 
1759-1760.  It is a handsome building, but the roof
is much decayed, and the inside work very superficial,
and by no means corresponding with the outside appear-
ance.  It stands about 297 feet above the high water mark
at Invergourie, and commands a varied and delight pro-
spect, comprehending the Tay in its course for several
miles, with a well clothed, fertile tract of country on the
one side of it, and the steepy boundary of Fife on the other.
The stipend is 7 chalders victual, and money about L. 53
Sterling, including L. 8, 14 s. which is no part of the teinds
of this district, but of a grant conjointly to two other mi-
nister and the minister of Bervie.  The glebe and garden
contain about 10 acres.  Heritors, comprehending those of
Logie parish, 9.  The whole valued rent L. 6680 Scots.
   -The average number of scholars at the parochial school
does not exceed 35.  The situation is centrical enough
with respect to the whole district, but yet not every com-
modious for one or two places, which contain by far, com-
paratively, the greater number of the inhabitants.  Be-
sides, the access to school from the west, is in a great mea-
sure shut up, and in winter the roads in every other direc-
tion are to children almost impassable.  To these causes,
