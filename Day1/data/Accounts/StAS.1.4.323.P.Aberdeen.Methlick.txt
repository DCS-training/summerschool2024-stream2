ago; now almost every person has a cart who can afford to
keep one.  There are 6 meal-mills; there are 2 ferry-
boats.  The fuel is peat and turf.-About 100 years ago,
there were 3 boys in the school of Methlick killed by thun-
der; the schoolmaster was much hurt; and the minister's
wife then here, being with child at the time, was so affect-
ed upon hearing of this event that the child she brought
forth some time after, was born paralytic, and continued so
till her death.-There are only 2 ale-houses.  From the
heavy tax on malt, there is great danger of the ale-houses
over all the country becoming dram-houses.  For some-
time past, the cottagers have gone to towns, having
found their immediate masters to be rather too hard upon
them.

   Dr George Cheyne, late physician at Bath, eminent in
his prosession, and also as an author, was born in this pa-
rish.  Dr Charles Maitland was also born and buried here.
He was the first who introduced inoculation into Britain,
and was sent to Hanover by George II.  to inoculate Fre-
derick Prince of Wales.
