   Manufactures.-There are four grain mills in the parish, as for-
merly noticed, in which wheaten flour, oat-meal, barley and pease
meal, and pearl barley, are manufactured. Of the latter article
particularly, a considerable quantity is prepared for the London
market. There are also in use here on every farm thrashing-mills
driven by horses, wind, water, or steam. One farmer has a bone-
mill, where 160 tons of bones, chiefly brought from Hamburgh,
are ground yearly, and after providing himself with what bone-dust
he requires, he supplies his neighbours with the surplus, to the
amount of L. 700 or L. 800 worth per annum.
   Paper-Mill.-There is here a paper-mill, lately much improved
by the introduction of the new machinery, by which the operations
are wonderfully facilitated, and the number of hands formerly em-
ployed, greatly reduced. The following statement by the proprietor
will give an idea of the magnitude and value, &c. of this establish-
ment. "The sorts of paper chiefly manufactured at Millbank
paper-mill are pasteboards and coloured papers. Eight years ago
a machine was erected by which paper is made into webs, and after-
wards cut into such sizes as are wanted. And recently, a new plan
has been adopted for drying it, by applying steam to the inside of
large cylinders, round which the paper passes and comes off quite
dry. The bleachfield at Ayton is given up, and is now employed in
bleaching rags, and reducing them into (what is called in the trade)
half stuff, and from thence taken down to the mill at Millbank, to
be prepared and made into paper. The wages paid to the work
people amount to nearly L. 800 a-year, and the excise duties to
upwards of L. 3000 a-year."
   Distillery.-A distillery was erected ten or twelve years ago at
Gunsgreen, upon the site and ruins of a former distillery, which
had been discontinued for many years. It is now in active operation,
and the following particulars respecting it have been communicated
by one of the partners: "Gunsgreen distillery is capable of making
1500 gallons of aqua weekly, which is mostly all sold in London. In
the spring of 1832, when potatoes were nearly unsaleable, and sel-
ling so low as 1s. 3d. per cwt., the distillers here, having a large
quantity on hand, were induced to enter their work for distilling
