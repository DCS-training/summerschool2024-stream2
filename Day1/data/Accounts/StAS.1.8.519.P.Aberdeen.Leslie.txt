bour under several great disadvantages.  Its distance from
market, being 30 miles from Aberdeen, the nearest sea port,
is none of the least considerable.  Thither the superflous pro-
duce of the lands must be carried, through roads execrably bad.
The distance from lime, too, so necessary to the farmer, is
another great obstacle to improvement.  The scarcity of ser-
vants, and the high wages they now demand, are also griev-
ances, but by no means peculiar to this parish*.  In a word, rent,
the price of labour, and every article necessary to a farm
is greatly raised to the husbandman, while the value of the
produce of his fields continues pretty much the same.  Cattle
is the only stock whole value is increased; but this parish
does not rear many.

   Proposed Improvements.-All these disadvantages, however,
might in a great measures be overcome, by granting longer
leases to the tenants; by relenting them from thirlage to mills,
and services of every kind; by assisting them to build better
houses; by encouraging industry and improvements of every
kind; and, above all, by attending more to the state of the
public roads.  The inhabitants perform the statute work up-
on the highways; but good roads will never be made by
statute labour, at least in the manner, in which it is conducted
in this district.  It distresses the people, but is of no advantage
to the public.  A patriotic zeal, for improving the roads,

*About 20 years ago, the wages of a common male farm servant were about
3 L. per annum; none are now to be got under 6 L.  At that period, the best
shearer, in harvest got 1 L.; the common wages now are 2 L.  A day labourer then
earned 4d. a day; now from 6d. to 8d,, besides victuals.  Should servants
Wages continue to increase, for a few years, in the same proportion as they
have done since 1783, the consequences must be, either the rent of land
must fall, or the tenant become bankrupt, and the lands be turned into
grass.
