ply the place of linens of Ireland; so that in time there
will remain few articles to barter between the two kingdoms.

   Fisheries.-A very extensive fishery might be established at
Portpatrick, particularly of cod; as the Channel is there the
narrowest, and the tide the strongest, none but the healthiest
and best fish can live in it.  The Late Sir James Hunter Blair
proposed the establishment of a fishing company, and, had he
lived, he would probably have effected it.  After his death,
some fishermen came and planted their lines, but the rapidi-
ty of the tide repeatedly carried them away.  Unfortunately
they had not skill enough to increase their anchorage, nor
sagacity to discover, that two stone weight was heavier than
one.

   Population.-The return to inquiries made by Dr.
Webster, regarding the population of the parish of Portpa-
trick, about forty years ago, was 551 souls.  It has since con-
fiderably increased.  It appears from an enumeration recent-
ly made, that there are in the country part of the parish,
484, and in the town, 512, souls, so that the whole popula-
tion amounts to 996, being an addition, in that space of time,
of 445 souls.
