comfortable; so that many of the cattle, cows, and horses, as
well as sheep and goats, lie in the fields without being housed
at all the whole year, and look and thrive better than such as have
been house fed.  Vegetation also commences early in these
parts; but the ground for husbandry is never begun to be
broke up till March, as rain and wet weather before that pe-
riod is reckoned more hurtful to it in that situation.  April is
the feed time for oats, and May for potatoes and bear; and
in August and September, all the harvest work about hay,

Lord Reay exacts no services for his own particular behoof
from the people of this parish, which lies at a great distance
from his own feat at Tongue; yet that is not the case with
respect to the tacksmen.  They parcel out among poor people,
as under tenants, such farms and out skirts of their possessions
as they do not labour for their own immediate behoof, upon
condition of paying the full rent of their different small holdings,
and some other small items; besides these, the subtenant en-
gages to perform such and such services, by sea or land, as
their master affairs may require; especially in harvest and
spring, they must be ready at a call, to do what work may be
assigned them; and, as they have no lease for their possessions,
