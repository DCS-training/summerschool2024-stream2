Reformed Presbytery; and that, besides a spinning power-loom
manufactory, five stories in height, and a large mill for spinning
flax, there have been twenty-one two storeyed dwelling-houses erect-

the fronts of these buildings are of hewn and polished ashlar, and
adorned with mouldings and carved decorations, creditable to the
taste and inventive capacity of their untutored architects.
