baptism, recorded during that period, the number, at an a-
verage, may be reckoned at least nine; which, by making
allowance for the disaffected, that fought no enrolment of
heir children, will confirm the conjecture, that the number
of persons in the parish was formerly greater.  With respect
to the state of the population, for some time past, the number
has rather diminished; there not being, at present, more than

own hands, being all turned into grass; and, as has been
mentioned, the other farms being held by fewer hands.
There is also no encouragement given here to manufac-
turers and small tenants; so that there are, at least, an hun-
