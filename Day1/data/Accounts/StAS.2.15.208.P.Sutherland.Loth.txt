            The future prosperity of this most valuable addition to the in-
        dustry of the parish may, with great confidence, be augured, from
        our knowledge of the sure and judicious foundation upon which
        it commenced, and also from the efficient means and resourices
        which are now provided, on a permanent footing, for supporting
        the extension and high character of the trade at Helmsdale, in-
        cluding the settlement of native and regularly bred boat-builders
        and 'Coopers, and the establishment also of a steam-mill for sawing,
        barrel staves, in the village.

                           V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
            The only villages in the parish are Helmsdale and Port Gower,
        which are both on the sea coast, and distant about two miles from
        each other. Port Gower is partly supported by some excellent
        land adjoining it, 'which is divided among a few of the villagers
        and by a settlement of active fishermen. It possesses a comfort-
        able and pleasantly situated inn ; and the Parliamentary road
        along the coast, towards Caithness, runs along it. Helmsdale enjoys
        ample means of communication with all parts of the kingdom,
        having the great North Parliamentary Road running through it,
        which, on one hand, leads to Wick and Thurso, and on the other,
        ta all parts of the south of Scotland and England; while a large
        steamer frequents Wick from Edinburgh, during eight thonths of
        the year; and the barbour of Helmsdale is often frequented by
        shipping from variousports of Britain and Ireland. The Parlia-
        mentary road through the parish, called the Dunrobin road, was
        completed, tinder one contract, in the year 1811, and extends
        from Galspie to life, Ord, a distance of 21 miles and 880 yards,
        and originally cost L. 6000 ;. and -13 miles of this road run
        through the parish of Loth. Another road leads from Helmsdale,
        through the Strath of Kildonari, to thb'North Sea At Bighouse;
        and a branch road, leading from Lothbe -through the Glen,
        joins the last-mentioned line of road, to the north of the church
        and manse, of Kildonan. The bridge of Helmsdale is a handsome
