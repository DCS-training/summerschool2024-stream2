of Hightae, Smallholm, Heck, and Greenhill, have been exorbi-
tantly raised in their rents and services, contrary to the express war-
rants of his Majesty's grandfather, dated in 1592 and 1602, grant-
ed to their predecessors on weighty and good considerations; there-
fore, his Majesty declares his royal intention, that the said tenants
should be protected, and these warrants obeyed as constant leases,
according to the true meaning thereof; and of new authorizes the
said tenants and their successors to possess and enjoy their respec-
tive lands,--they paying and performing yearly the rent and ser-
vices paid by their ancestors in the year 1602; and prohibits and
discharges the keepers of the Castle of Lochmaben, or any who
shall pretend right to the said Crown lands, in all time coming, to
exact more rent or services from the tenants thereof than they were
in use to pay and perform at the dates of the said warrants, or to
remove them from their ancient possessions, so long as they thank-
fully pay and perform the same."
	Besides the lands lying around the villages, there was a large
and extensive commonty, in which they all had an interest. By
mutual agreement, this commonty was divided many years ago, and
their several portions improved, and substantial houses built upon
them, which, from their extent, are of more value than the origi-
nal property. The greater proportion of these lands have been
purchased by Mr Bell of Rammerscale, a neighbouring proprietor.

	Character, &c. of the People.--In this burgh and parish, no
doubt, a considerable quantity of ardent spirits is consumed: but
in general the inhabitants are sober, industrious, religious, and
many of them of considerable intellectual attainments. Within
these last forty years, great improvements have taken place, in re-
gard to their comfort, both in houses and in clothing.
	The prevailing game in summer is quoits, which is played by
many with great dexterity; and in winter, curling. As players of
