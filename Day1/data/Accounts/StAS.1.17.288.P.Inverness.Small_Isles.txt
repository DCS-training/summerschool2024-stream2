were wont to attend mass in time of the Reformation.  Their
altar is still to be seen.  Its roof is irregularly arched; its
height, at the entrance, about 60 feet; its length, 220 feet,
and its breadth, 30 feet.  Near the entrance of this cave,
some parts of the rock seem to have been once in a liquified
state.  At no great distance east of this cave, is Uamha
Fhraine, (the Cave of Francis) remarkable not only for its
form, but also for the murder of the inhabitants of this island

The people in the cave, impatient of their consinement, sent
a scout to reconnoitre, who imprudently shewed himself up-
on an eminence, where he was readily observed by the ene-

inhabitants, there was new laid snow upon the ground.
M'Leod re-landed, and traced the scout to the cave's mouth:
He offered, upon delivering up to him the murderers of his
people, to spare the other inhabitants.  The terms were re-
