     Of Ruthven.

The many melancholy accidents which have happened at one
of the fords of this river, might be expected to work upon
the feelings of all concerned, so far as to induce them to add
one more at least to the number.

   Ecclesiastical Matters, Stipend, Poor, etc.-Tradition says,
that the church of Ruthven was erected by the Earl of Craw-
ford, proprietor of the barony of Inverquiech, for the accom-
modation of his tenants, several of them having been killed
by the Rollons of Balloch, in going to their parish church of
Alyth.  Afterward, when the curbulent neighbours were re-
moved, and the church became of no further use to the te-
nants of Inverquiech, the proprietor of Ruthven got that ba-
rony erected into a separate parish, and obtained the Earl of
Crawford's chapel, which lay convenient, to be the parish
church, and the lands mortified to its minister to be a glebe.
It does not appear how this transaction was brought about,
probably it might have been through the interference of the
abbot of Arbroath, who was both patron of the parish, and
titular of the tithes.  Upon the forfeiture of the Panmuir fa-
mily, in 1715, the right of patronage devolved to the
Crown: the minister is titular of the tithes by a gift in the
year 1634, from the Marquis of Hamiltom, then proprietor
of the Abbey-lands, to Mr. Patrick Crichton, minister of
Ruthven, and his succesors in office.  The stipend is below
the minimum, and has never been augmented.  The glebe,
consisting of upwards of 20 acres of good soil, is pleasantly
situated on the W. bank of the river Isla, with a gentle slope
to the S. and E.  The living, including, the glebe, may be
reckoned rather better than 60 L. communibus annis.-There
is a fund of upwards of 100 L. for the support of the poor,
which was lately augmented by a legacy of 20 L. from Mr.
Andrew Pitcairn, writer in Dundee, whose father, Mr. Ro-
