consumption of their own families.  The produce of ptao-
toes is various, according to the difference of soil and season,
from 12 to 20 seeds; and a crop of them, when they turn
out well, far exceeds in value one of oats.  They are plant-
ed in drills, laid down in the end of April or beginning
of May, and taken up in the end of October.  Turnips
are cultivated only by one farmer in the parish; who intro-
duced them a few years ago.  They are sown in drills with
a drill barrow, in the end of June and beginning of July;
and the light dry soil being well adapted for turnips, the
crops have proved remarkably good.  Milch-cows are part-
ly, but young cattle are chiefly, fed with them in winter.

   Grass Seeds.-With respect to the quantity of tillage,
the tenants are universally restricted to the third of the ara-
ble land; and the ordinary course is that of 3 years in crop,
and 6 in grass; or when a green crop intervenes, 2 crops
of oats before it, 1 of barley after it, and 6 years in grass.
Over all the improved land in the parish, the fields are sown
out with clover and rye grass; though in the low soft
ground, where natural clover grows in profusion, rye grass
only is generally sown.  The quantity allowed by the best
farmers to the acre, is about a bushel of English rye grass,
or a bushel and a half of Scotch, and 12 pound of clover,
generally two-thirds of it red, and one-third of it white;
less of the white being sown, because the ground of itself
soon produces a good deal of it.  But the generality of
the tenants, from a foolish economy, give much less to the
acre, especially of the clover.

   Stock.-In this parish, as over all the rest of the coun-
try, the breed of horses has been greatly improved.  The
little galloways, the native produce of this place, are to-
