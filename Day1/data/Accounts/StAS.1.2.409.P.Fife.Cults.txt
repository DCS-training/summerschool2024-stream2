his army here, and the other at Newtyle in Angus.  Many urns
have been dug up, full of bones, on and near this hill.

   Minerals.-There is abundance of free-stone and lime-stone

Angus.  The strata are from 2 to 10 feet below the surface,
and are wrought, without having much recourse to the assist-
