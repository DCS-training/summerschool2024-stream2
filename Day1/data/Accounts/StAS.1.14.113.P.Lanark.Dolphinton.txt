and drive away the cattle; and it is natural to suppose,
that the people would endeavour to secure their cattle,
by some means or other.
   I am led to conjecture, that this was the principal
design, not only of this, but likewise of many other places
of the same kind, situated on the tops of the hills in this

stone coffins of all dimensions, from children to full grown
men.  These coffins were not of one stone, but of seve-
