new machinery, with which it is now fitted, is of the most modern
and, improved description; and, altogether, the factory, which, is
again in operation, is in a more efficient state than it was before
the conflagration took place.
	There is a brick manufactory about a quarter of a mile to the north
of Gatehouse, belonging to Mrs Hornsby. The quantity of brick
made averages about 6O,OOO per annum. The wages paid t0 the men,
who vary in number at different seasons of the year, are 9s. per week.
There, is also a brewery carried on by Mr Andrew Kirk, in which
927 bushels of barley are manufactured into ale and beer annually.
The number of men employed is three. Their wages are 10s.per
week. There is also an extensive nursery belonging to Mr Credie,
which has existed for nearly half a century. A tannery exists, in
a flourishing state on the west of the Fleet; but as this is in the
parish of Anwoth, it does not fall within our sphere. Green hides
are manufactured in Gatehouse by Mr Samuel Blyth, to the ex-
tent of about L.400 annually.
	Navigation.--Boat-Green, the port of Gatehouse, is on the
Anwoth side of the Fleet; but as it is not 300 yards from the
bridge which here unites the two parishes, and as by far the prin-
cipal portion of the trade is connected with this town and parish,
we have thought it proper to give here the following table, con-
taining an abstract of the shipping, both inward and outward, at
the harbour:--

         Market-Town.--The only village and market-town in the parish
is Gatehouse of Fleet, which contains, as previously mentioned,
a population of 1377. The town of Fleet, formerly alluded to,
and which is supposed to have stood on the site which Gatehouse
now occupies, has long disappeared, nor do any traditions respect-
ing it exist in the parish. The only traces of its existence con-
sists in the eight weekly markets held in successive Fridays, be-
ginning on the first Friday of November, annually. Symson, who
wrote in the time of Charles II, and before a stone of the present
town was laid, says," At a place called Gatehouse of Fleet, there
is a market for good fat kine kept on the Friday after the first
