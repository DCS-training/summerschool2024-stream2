Plantagenet, brother to Edward III. King of England; and
a second time at the Reformation, when all the ancient mo-
numents and relics were destroyed by the reformers.  And
indeed the marks of conflagration seem still visible on the
wall of the tower, on the side adjoining to the church.
   The parish is situated in the upper ward of the county of
Lanark, in the presbytery of that name, and synod of Glas-
gow and Ayr.  It is of a broad oval figure, the longest dia-
meter being about 14 miles, and the shortest about 12.  It
lies upon the south-west side of the river Clyde, which runs
along the border of it for about 9 or 10 miles; and in this
course are the stupendous falls of the river at Bonnitown,
Corhouse, and Stonbyres, so well known, and repeatedly de-
scribed.
   The banks of the Clyde in this parish are very bold, rising,
in many places, abruptly into hills of a considerable height,
every where divided by deep gullies, formed by the nume-
rous brooks and torrents which fall into the river.  The in-
termixture of coppice woods, plantations of forest trees, and
sloping open glades, of swelling eminences, deep ravines, and
towering hills, on both sides of the river, added to the wind-
ings of its copious stream, and the magnificent falls above
mentioned, exhibit to the eye of the passenger, at every
change of situation, new landscapes strikingly sublime and
beautiful.
   The soil is various.  Part of the northern corner of the
parish is of a clayey nature, but light friable moulds are more
frequent; in some places it is sandy, in others stoney and gra-
velly.  The face of the country is every where uneven; and to-
wards the south and west becomes very mountainous, and the
soil mossy and muirish.  The tops of the mountains are co-
vered with bent, grass, and heath; towards the bottoms, where
moss does not prevail, there are green pastures and arable
