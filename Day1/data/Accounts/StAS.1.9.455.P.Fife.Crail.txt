   Manufactures,etc.-The reader must not expect to hear
of the flourishing state of trade and manufactures in this
parish.  They are indeed in a very languishing situation.
The natural migration of commerce from small towns,
where the stock of the trader is inconsiderable, and the de-
mand for consumption limited, to great towns, where the
capitals of merchants are large, and the demands extensive
and constant, has deprived Crail of any little portion of
foreign trade which it formerly enjoyed.  The various
mercantile articles which are required, are brought weekly
by the carriers from Edinburgh or Dundee, and occasional-
ly from Leith by sea.  Properly speaking, there is no ma-
nufacture established here.  The women, however, are ge-
nerally employed in spinning lint-yarn for the manufactu-
rers in other places, to the extent of many thousand spin-
dles every year.  At present the price is from 1 s. 3 d to
8d. the spindle, according to the quality.  A few shoes
are made for the market; and nearly 40,000 yards of
sheetings, Osnaburghs, coarse brown linen, etc. are wrought
by the weavers for sale, over and above what is manufac-
tured for private use.  It is to be hoped, that by proper
exertions, these, and other branches of business, will be
gradually extended and improved.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The parish enjoys no
peculiar advantages over those in the neighbourhood along
the coast of Fife.  Its disadvantages are, the want of shel-
ter, which exposes it to the blast from every quarter.  Its an-
gular situation which circumscribes its intercourse to a small
district of country, and a scarcity of running water, which
discourages the introducton of any manufacture which re-
seems deserving of notice, is a stone which stands upon a small tumulus
between Crail and Sauchop.  A cross is rudely sculptured upon it.  Con-
cerning the time or occasion of its erection, there is no tradition.
