     The Statistical Account

in preference to any place in Staffordshire; the price of land,
the* price of labour, the cheapness of provisions, plenty of
fish, quantity and cheapness of fuel, are all in favour of this
place.  Add to this, the benefit of water carriage, like to be
soon so universal from this place, by means of the Shannon
and Grand Canal.  At Durslem, where they manufacture
the queen's ware, they carry flint by land 60 miles, and lye
near 60 miles from any sea-port.  Here, an easy water car-
riage is likely soon to he effected, to almost every principal port
in the kingdom.
   The navigation could be easily extended to the west coast.
The north-west part of Lough Allen is distant from Lough
Gilly, which extends to Sligo, about 7 miles; and the level
of the two waters, taken with exactnes, is about 8 feet,
neither high hills nor deep vallies intervening.
   The size of the farms, I take it, would be also favourable
to population and manufactures.-The rising grounds, as in-
tersected by the vallies, run from 40 to 80 acres.  The pro-
portion of bog and mountain to arable and meadow, exceeds
one half, and I take the whole district, on improvement,
would turn out from 12 to 13,000 acres.
   These are such answers as I can give at present to your
queries, which I have made as short as possible, the less to en-
croach on your time:  But I imagined you would not think
this district the more unworthy your notice, for being
hitherto the most neglected and uncultivated in the king-
dom, though perhaps, from its many natural advantages,
the most capable of being improved to public and national
utility.
