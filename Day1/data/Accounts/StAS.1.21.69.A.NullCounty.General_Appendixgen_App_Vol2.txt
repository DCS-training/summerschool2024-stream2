     Additional Communications from the Rev. James Wemysk.

   I had the honour to receive yours some weeks ago, and
since that time have made out an exact numeration of the
parish, and find the whole to be 1210.  Still, however, there
is a deficiency of the number made in the return to Dr. Web-
ster.  This, I apprehend, may be accounted for from the de-
crease in shipping since that period, and also from the te-
nants and proprietors having fewer cottars upon their grounds
than formerly-this I think a bad plan, and an evil attend-
ing large farms.
