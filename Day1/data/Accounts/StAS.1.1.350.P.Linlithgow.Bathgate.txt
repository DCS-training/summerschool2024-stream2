turnips, etc. are only in small quantities.  The barley harvest,
in ordinary years, begins about the latter end of August, or
beginning of September: and the pease, beans, and oats, im-
mediately follow; the produce being generally six for one.
There may be between 400 and 500 acres of hay from sown
grass, as also considerable pieces of natural meadow in the
parish; the last is generally cut about the beginning of Au-
gust, and the former early in July.  Most kinds of trees which
usually grow in Scotland are to be found here; such as the
ash, elm, beech, oak, and the different sorts of firs.  In the
parish are about 320 milch cows, 700 young and old black
cattle, 250 horses fit for labour, about 60 more from 1 to 3
years old, and not above 200 sheep.

land is from 20 to 25 years purchase of the free rent.

   Prices of Provisions.-The present price of beef, mutton,
lamb, and pork, is 3 1/2 d. a pound, Dutch weight; the two

fucking pig is usually sold for as many shillings as it is weeks
