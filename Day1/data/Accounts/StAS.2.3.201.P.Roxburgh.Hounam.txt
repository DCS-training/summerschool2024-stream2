from 1000 to 1200 yards of drill, lineal measure, for potatoes;
4 caps of lint-seed sown; 3 or 4 double cart-load of coals, by pay-
ing the coal-hill price; a cow kept; a free house and garden, for
which they furnish a female bondager for shearing in harvest, and
other out-door work, who is paid by the tenant at the rate of 10d.
per day in summer, and in winter somewhat less. A shepherd's
wage consists of 2 cows, and from 40 to 45 sheep, to graze on the
farm to which he belongs;-coals and potatoes as above described,
and a free house and garden. The general rate of a day-labour-
er's wage, without victuals, is, for men during summer, 1s. 8d.
per day, and for women 1s.; and during winter for men from 1s. 4d.
to 1s. 6d., and for women 10d., sometimes less. In harvest the
wages rise to from 13s. to 14s. for men, and for women from 12s.
to 13s. per week, with victuals. Doing work by the piece is very
general; such as mowing and ditching. Mowing costs from 2s. 6d.
to 3s. the acre; and the general rate of a mower's wage is about
2s. 6d. per day without victuals. Masons and carpenters have each
from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d. in summer, and about 2s. in winter, without
victuals. A tailor has 1s. 6d. a-day and his victuals. Blacksmiths,
furnishing the necessary iron, are paid at the rate of L. 3 per an-
num for each pair of horses kept upon the farm. This includes
shoeing, and repairing plough irons and harrows; and for every
riding horse shoeing L. 1.

   Stock.-The common breed of cattle are the short-horned, to
the improvement of which great attention has been paid. The
number of cows kept in the parish is 65; young cattle, 110.
The best sorts of the Cheviot breed of sheep, which are found to

on the hill pasture; while, on the lower and are lands, it has
