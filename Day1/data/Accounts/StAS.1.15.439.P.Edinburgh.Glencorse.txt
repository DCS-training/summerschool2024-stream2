led in the South of Scotland, it appeared, that the timber is
more valuable and useful than has generally been supposed.
   About the year 1700, there had also been planted at Wood-
houselee, and at Greenlaw in this parish, a considerable num-
ber of laburnums.  Some of them were cut in the year 1762,
and afforded a plank from 10 to 14 inches in breadth, of
very beautiful timber.  At both places, these trees grew in
a high part of the country, in a meagre soil, and in an ex-
posed situation.  When they came to be worked into furni-
ture, a remarkable difference appeared, in the quality of their
wood, compared to that of laburnums of the same age, which
grew at Panmure in Forfarshire, in a rich soil, and in a low
and sheltered situation: carved work, in the Panmure labur-
num, was executed by the cabinet maker with the ordinary
tools; but in the Woodhouselee and Greenlaw laburnum, it
required the assistance of steel files, from the greater closeness
and hardness of the wood.

   Animals.-The red squirrel (sciurus vulgaris rufus of Lin-
naeus,) has become extremely common of late years.  In this
neighbourhood, the woods abound with them, and they are
pretty numerous at Woodhouselee.  Though a beautiful ani-
mal, they are destructive of the small birds, by devouring
their eggs, and are extremely injurious to young planting, by
croping and barking the tender shoots.  The larch tree suffers
particularly from this animal.
   In the year 1749, when the coal was worked at Newhall,
in the neighbouring parish of Pennycuick, it was remarked
that the coalliers houses, and other cottages, in which no-
thing was burnt but coal, abounded with bugs.  In the neigh-
bourhood of that coal, there was plenty of peat moss, and
there, as it happens in other parts of Scotland, many of the
cottagers chose rather to use peat than coal for their fuel.
