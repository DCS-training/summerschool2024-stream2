     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH OF EDENHAM, OR EDNAM.

     (County of Roxburgh-Presbytery of Kelso-Synod of Merse
     and Tiviotdale.)

     By the Rev. Mr. DAVID DICKSON, Minister.

     Name, Situation, and Rivers.

   THIS parish derives its name from a compound of Eden
and Ham; being situated on the banks of the river Eden,
and Ham signifying a village.  The village, where the church
stands, is built on the N. bank of the river Eden, which
runs for more than 3 miles through this district, and joins
the Tweed at Edenmouth.  The parish is placed in one of the
most delightful situations in Scotland, on the banks of the
river Tweed.  This beautiful river, after being joined by the
Tiviot at Kelso, bounds the parish of Edenham, about a mile
below it, on the S. and S. E.  The parish is not quite a mile
and a half distant from the English border, at the burn of
Carham, on the opposite side of the Tweed, formerly well
known by the name of the March Burn.
