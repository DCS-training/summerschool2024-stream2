     Statistical Account

Toremont, and Tents-muir, or Big waters.  I observe this
year, that the tenants are cutting drains, and letting the wa-
ter out of these canals, to render the pasture more beneficial
to their cattle.  Strangers riding into this flat and not very
fertile part of the parish, are surprised with finding this wate-
ry variety.  I have seen their eyes return to it with pleasure.
In the summer, especially if it be a dry one, the greatest part
of the water is carried away by the wind, and exhaled by the
fun.  When in this state, the canals furnish a considerable
quantity of coarse grass for the horses and cattle.  In this part
of the district, there are cattle of a small size reared, as may
well be supposed, from the nature of their pasture; and a
few working horses of a diminutive breed, to labour the fields,
of no great extent, kept in tillage.  One great disadvantage at-
tending this sandy part of the parish is, that after the fields
are sown and burrowed, if the wind blows strong from the
west, or southwest, the mould is blown off the seed, and not
infrequently, a considerable part of the seed is blown from
the sown ground.
   This soil is favourable to turnips, barley, and clover; good
crops of oats and rye, are obtained here.  The barley that
grows in this sandy soil, is heavier in proportion to an equal
quantity of the same grain that is produced from good clay
the former being thinner in the husk than the latter.  The
crops of pease, with a few beans among them, are not so sure
or productive.
   There is in this part of the district, a salmon fishing of no
inconsiderable value, opposite to a small rivulet that runs into
the ocean.  From the entry of this rivulet, along the shore to
the river Eden, the people sometimes amuse themselves by
fishing in the summer season, in the following manner: Two
of the people take a long net with weights upon the lower
edge of it, go into the sea as far as they may with safety, ex-
