     Statistical Account

which commonly happen with such storms and tempests
as we have sometimes here, were never felt or known in
this parish or country, so far as I can learn.  Three remark-
able water-spouts happened in the course of the last 50
years.  The last one happened about 13 years ago.  It ap-
pears from the astonishing effects they produced on and
near the places where they fell, that had they happened in
any of the inhabited parts of the parish, the consequences
would have been lamentable and fatal indeed.  They fell
on the high and remote parts of the parish, which will bear
testimony to these events for many ages to come.  But,
after all, I am inclined to suspect, though these effects are
ascribed to water-spouts, that they were produced from an-
other cause, viz. from the irruption of an immense collec-
tion of water, penned up in some of the prodigiously deep
and very extensive morasses, which are not few in the
Highland parts of the parish; and what gives this the sem-
blance of probability is, that in many of these morasses, or
flows, as they are here called, when the surface is bored, the
water issues out like a torrent with great force.
   Here I should not omit a real water-spout, in the strict
sense of the word, that happened about 200 years ago on
the loch of Cathel; a whole family residing on a very small
island in the loch, excepting the youngest child and his
nurse, were destroyed by it.  This awful event was so far
from being a cause of regret to the neighbourhood, that
they exceedingly rejoiced at it, as thereby they were hap-
pily delivered from the terror and rapine with which they
were perpetually annoyed and harassed by that lawless and
plundering family; for they lived on rapine and plunder,
and fortified themselves on this small island, to the utter
defiance and vexation of the oppressed neighbourhood.
The master of this family was by name Gaine Kiaricach,
