     Statistical Account

that part of Tarland and Migvy immediately under the minis-
ter's inspection, and on Deskry side, where he catechises re-
gularly every year, the number of souls can be ascertained ve-
ry exactly.  In the year 1768, in there bounds, the numbers
were 826 above 7 years of age, and 101 below 7;-total 927.
From that time to 1791, the numbers have been fluctuating,
but upon the whole decreasing.  In 1791, the numbers in the
same bounds were, 688 above 7, and 118 below 7;-total 806.
The occasion of this decrease may be, that many families, upon
being reduced in their circumstances, remove to towns, where,
from the improvements that are carrying on, in agriculture,
manufactures, etc. they get work and wages in proportion to
their strength and capacity; and, by these means, make a shift
to live much better than they could have done by continuing
in their former situation.  Within these 14 or 16 years past,
many numerous families have gone from Tarland to Aberdeen.
-Some individuals have reached the age of 80, or it be may a
little above that, but none have exceeded 90 since 1767.  Of
806, the total number anno lo 1791, 400 are males, and 406 fe-
males.  Of the whole, there may be under 10 years of age, a-
bout 180; from 10 to 20, about 170; from 20 to 50, about
310; from 50 to 70, about 130; and from 70 to 90, about 16,
as nearly as can be guessed.  The return to Dr. Webster in
1755, from the whole united parishes, was 1300 souls.

   Farms, Agriculture, etc.-In tim parishes of Tarland
and Migvy, exclusive of that part of Tarland in Strathdon,
there may be about 50 or 54 farms; some of larger and some
of lesser extent; some possessed by one, and others by two te-
nants, each of whom have from 2 to 3, and some 4 or 5 sub-
tenants; and about a dozen of smaller possessions occupied on-
ly by one tenant.  The number of horses and cattle upon these
farms is various, according to the abilities of the farmer;
