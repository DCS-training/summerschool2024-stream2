ly attended to, it is thought a capital blunder is commit-
ted; for the following is the plan they have adopted.  They
lime, and often at the same time, dung part of the worst of
their farm (outfield).  They take two successive crops of
oats, the effect of the lime for the first crop is not very per-
ceptible, the second crop is excellent.  Bear is sown for
the third crop, and he who did not lay on the dung with
the lime, now does it.  This crop amply repays the ex-
pense.  It is now humbly submitted to the skilful impro-
ver, whether they ought not with this crop to sow it out
with artificial grasses; if they did so, they would keep the
ground in heart; but instead of doing so, the greater part
take other two crops of oats.  These they have very good.
Still by this plan, however, and by taking so many crops
of oats, they exhaust the ground to a great degree Any
part of their infield which they have cleaned, and had un-
der green crop, they generally lay down with grasses, and
to encourage them to this laudable practice, Mr Farquhar-
son of Finzean, presented several of his tenants with some
quantity of grass seeds last spring; the like had been done
by Mr Gerard of Midstrath, in a former year.  The dis-
tinction of outfield and infield ought as much as possible
to be laid aside, and equal justice should be done to the
whole farm, be it small or great.  Winter herding ought
to be practised; but to this, they who are least industrious,
and have least to care for, are, as may be expected, most a-
verse.  The number of acres under cultivation cannot be
easily ascertained, they are already rated at about 2200,
more might be improved, and certainly have been arable
on the hills and moors.  Indeed, there might be an addi-
tion of several hundred acres by trenching the baulks or
waste flips of ground that in many farms do still abound.
Of the above number of acres, we may reckon one-sixth
part in lee or natural grass.  A small proportion is annually
