part of Strathern a delightful country to live in, particularly
during the summer season.  The chief inconvenience, we feel,
is our distance from coal; which, though brought in carts,
over a hilly road, upwards of 20 miles, is a cheaper fuel than
parts or wood.  We have now, however, the prospect of
having this inconvenience in some degree remedied, by the
turnpike road, that is propose 1 to be carried from Crieff to
Blairngone, which is our nearest coal pit.  Indeed, nothing
seems to be wanting but coals to make this a very thriving
country.  For if that necessary article could be got at a mo-
derate price, we should find limestone in abundance for im-
proving our lands.  We should also have manufactures of
different kinds established, among us, as we have the finest falls
of water for driving machinery, particularly on the Erne and
the Turrot, in the neighbourhood of the populous village of
Crieff.  On the latter river, there are not less than 15 or 16
mills, of different kinds, in the course of a mile and a half;
and as it takes its rise from a lake of considerable extent, by
crewing a dike at the mouth of the lake (which could be dons
for 15 1.), a sufficient quantity of water could be obtained, for
driving the heavier machinery, even in the greater drought.
The manufactured goods could be easily transported, from
Crieff to Perth, by the turnpike road, which is now forming
between there two towns; or by a canal, which could be car-
ried from Crieff to within a mile of the Tay, without a lock,
There improvements, however, we do not expect to fee car-.
tied to their greatest height, unless we can find coal nearer
than Blairngone.  Our proprietors, therefore, who shew
abundance of public spirit on most occassions, should unite,
and make a fair trial for discovering coal in Strathern.  Were
the to take the lead, all the parishes around would certainly
contribute liberally towards such an undertaking.
