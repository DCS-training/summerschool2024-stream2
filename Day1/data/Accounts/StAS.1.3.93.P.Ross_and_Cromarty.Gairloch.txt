   Poor.-The number of the poor in this, as well as in
many other Highland parishes, is daily increasing.  There
are 84 upon the kirk-session roll; besides some other indi-
gent persons, who, though not inrolled, yet are considered as
objects of sympathy.  They have the annual collections made
in the church, with the interest of L. 20 distributed among
them.  The collections upon an average are about L. 6:7:0.

   Language.-The Gaelic is the prevailing language in this,
as well as in several other corners on the West coast, where
the people have no opportunity of learning English.
