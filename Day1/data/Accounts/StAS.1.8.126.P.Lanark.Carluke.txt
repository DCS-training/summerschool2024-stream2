in all, upwards of 80 acres of land.  Many natural causes
may be assigned, why this parish should be so remarkable for
its fruit; particularly the following:  1st, The soil at the bot-
tom of the banks, being a pure clay, several yards deep, is
more favourable for fruit, than even the holm ground it-
self: 2dly, The holm being narrow, and the banks on each
side nigh to each other, the heat is greatly increased, by the
rays of the sun being reflected from the opposite banks:  3dly,
The banks being steep, and opening often into bosoms, afford.
a shelter by nature, which no art could ever produce.  The
last advantage arises, from the fortunate exposure to the S.
and S. W., the most favourable that this country can possibly
enjoy.
