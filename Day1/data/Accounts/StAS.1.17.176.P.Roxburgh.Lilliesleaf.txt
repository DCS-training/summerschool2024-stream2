cwt. are by far the cheapest.  In the article of firing, the
inhabitants must be at a greater expence than any parish in
the south of Scotland.  Agues, 20 years ago, were very fre-
quent in the village, the road being almost impassable on ac-
count of putrid stagnated water.  This being removed, and the
road formed and finished, aguish complaints have almost totally
disappeared.  It is unfortunate that this corner should be so
bare of trees, there being plenty of ground well adapted
for large plantations, particularly of firs.  The weedings
would be useful as fuel; the body of the tree profitable, in
a parish so remote from the sea coast; and the ground en-
riched by the leaves.

   Population.-It is generally believed, that the population is
greatly diminished, there being vestiges of considerable vil-
lages, where now there stand only one or two houses.  Since
the year 1760, 9 farms have been added to such as lay adja-
cent; and though the rent of each was not very consider-
able, yet the honest tacksman cleared with the proprietor,
and brought up and educated his children, who proved use-
ful members of society.  But whatever diminution may have
lately taken place in the population of the parish, from these
and similar causes, it is certain, that there has been an in-
crease upon the whole, within there 40 years, as appears from
the following comparative statement:
