None of the farmers keep a regular stock of sheep on account
of their hedges.  A few are bought in occasionally to be fat-
tened for the butcher, and a few of English breed are kept
as pets.-These together may be valued at 50 L.  The annual
produce of a milch cow, besides her calf, is from 3 L. to 4 L.
the average 3 L. 10 s.-Butter, 9 d. per lib. of 24 ounces; and
cheese, from 2 1/2 d. to 6 d. the same weight.

   Agriculture.-As to agriculture, the general practice is to
plough the land for 3 years, and lay it out into grass for 6;
after which, it is again plowed for 3 years; and so on during
the tack.  Lands are commonly let for 19 years; and the
above course of management is specified in the tacks; how-
ever, a better rotation of crops is sometimes followed. 1st,
Potatoes with dung, or (though seldom) turnips. 2d, Bar-
ley with red clover, 10 or 12 lib. to the acre. 3d, Red clo-
ver. 4th, Oats.  Then, 5th, Potatoes with dung, and so
on as before.  This is found to be a good plan on dry land.
But the staple articles with the farmers here are oats and
bear.  Small patches only are sown with wheat, pease, beans,
and barley.  Lime is universally used as a manure; it is laid
upon the grass a year or two before the field is to be plowed;
the quantity about 100 bolls per acre; that is, 200 Winches-
ter bushels of unslacked lime, which commonly yield 400
bushels of slacked lime.  Sometimes it is laid upon a fallow,
