     Statistical Account

   From this abstract, taken from the custome house-books,
it appears, there were 19 vessels entered in three years,
whose cargoes consisted of 44,454 cwt. 3 qrs. 9 lb. rice;
the duty on which, if not exported, would have been
L. 14,182:  8:  6 3/4; but, as the whole was exported, the
drawback on exportation reduced this duty to L. 1419,

   Since the independence of America, all hopes of the
produce of the Southern States of North America passing
this way are lost.  The produce, however, of our settle-
ments at Hudson's Bay still pass this way.

   Hudson's Bay Company's Ships.-Hudson's Bay was dis-
covered by Henry Hudson, in 1610.  France, after dispu-

tons each, which carry out provisions, guns, powder, shot,
hatchets, cloths, etc. to be exchanged with the Indians for
beaver, and other furs.  These vessels usually arrive at the
harbour of Stromness about the first of June, where they
stop for two or three weeks to take aboard men for their
settlements.  They engage usually from 60 to 100 men,
natives of this country, to go to these settlements, every

and they engage for lower wages than either the English

sailors, from L. 18 to L. 25; boat-builders, from L. 20 to
