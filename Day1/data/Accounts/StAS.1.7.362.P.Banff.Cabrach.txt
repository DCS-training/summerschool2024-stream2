of their fields, than on the profits of a traffic they carry on
in sheep and black cattle.  The soil is wet, and full of
swamps, productive enough in provender for cattle; but
owing to the frost, mists, and hoar frost in autumn, the annual
produce of grain does not exceed the consumpt of the inha-
bitants.
   The farmers sow bear and birley oats only; and there in
the upper parts of the parish are always more or less affected
by the frosts, in so much that if the season has not been ex-
tremely favourable, they never depend on their own bear,
and but seldom on their birley oats for feed.
   Sometimes one half of a field is frosted, and the other
safe; and what is still more extraordinary, the upper half of
the car has been found to be affected, while the lower was
safe.  Daily experience evinces, that the corn, on the heights
and eminences, run less risk than those on flat low grounds.
For the most part they begin to sow in the end of March,

inclosures through the whole parish, experiments are not
tried on a large scale.  Clover and rye-grass have been sown
in yards with success; cabbages are common.

   Agriculture and Employments.-The mode of culture is per-
haps the same at this day which it was a century ago.  The
plough in use is the old Scotch, drawn by 6, 8, or 10 oxen,
or cows and oxen, or horses and oxen together.  The dung
is, in a great measure, carried out in creels, on the horses sides,
a method by which there is a great waste of time that might
be gained, 3 of these loads being only equal to one of a cart.
   Men and women are employed, and as soon as the seed-
time is done, the plough and harrow are laid aside; the far-
