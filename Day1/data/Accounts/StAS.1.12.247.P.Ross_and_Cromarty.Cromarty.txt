vern, formed in a rock close by the sea, having an entrance
sufficiently large to admit an ordinary sized man.  From the
roof and sides of this cavern, there is a continual dropping of
water, some of which falls to the bottom of the cave, but by far
the greater quantity is quickly petrified into a white hard sub-

accessible, and is truly a curious phenomenon.

   Climate, and Diseases.-The climate is generally more mild
in the town and its vicinity, than above the bank and in the
country.  Frost is frequently intense a mile or 2 from the
town, when it is little felt immediately around it.  The cold
is most piercing in this place, when the wind blows from the

occasioned by the scarcity and high price of proper fuel.  The
inhabitants are, in general, healthy, and many instances of
their living to the age of 80 years, or thereby, might be ad-

The small-pox raged, in this place, to a great degree, during

It is, with pleasure, however, to be observed, that the peo-
