Orkneymen, and to the merchants in Lerwick, who send
them to Leith, London, Hull, Holland, &c.  They fetch
from 12 L. to 36 L. Scotch, i. e. from 1 L. to 3 L. Sterling.
   The number of sheep cannot be properly ascertained, as
they go at freedom on the hills; and some of them, are so
wild, as only to be caught by dogs; and the owners are very
careful to conceal their number, to cheat the teind-master.
Perhaps 9000 may be near the truth.
   There are 850 milching cows, besides oxen and young
cattle, and a great number of swine, who go loose in the
pasture in summer; and not being ringed, do a great deal of
mischief; and, in winter, they turn up and destroy the corn
land and meadows.  No mines or mineral springs of any
consequence.

   Disadvantages.-The want of manufactures is a great loss,
as the people, especially women and children, are idle for at
least half of the year.-The woollen manufacture most natu-
rally presents itself, in the first place.  The tenants have no
tacks, but sit from year to year, at the will of their landlord.
By this means they are discouraged from improving their
farm; because, when they grow old, or unable to go to sea,
they may be turned out, and are very often overbid by
young stout men.  The immoderate consumpt of tea and
spirituous liquours is a great ruin to their health and circum-
stances.  It would be impossible to carry on the fishing with-
out gin; but the small retail shops in the parish are a great
nuisance and ruin.
   The people, in general, have too great a turn for fine
clothes.  A great deal of money is laid out in a year for
Scotch and English cloths, stuffs, cottons, lawns, &c. while
their own wool is neglected or destroyed.  Perhaps a pre-
mium offered to the man who had the best suit of clothes
