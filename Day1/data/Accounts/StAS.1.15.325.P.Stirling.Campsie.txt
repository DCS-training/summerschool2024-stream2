and son-in-law performed the office of public huntsman, from
the year 1715, till 1792, a period of fourscore years: They

   Now there are scarcely as many beasts of prey in the whole

verting of sheep pasture into grazing for black cattle, where-

the large fox has migrated to the high lands, where his food
is more abundant.  In proportion as the beasts and birds of
prey, have left this district the singing birds have increased;
several species have appeared of late, which were formerly
unknown, particularly the bulsinch and the wood-lark.  It is
perhaps at the Clachan of Campsie, which is situated in the
neighbourhood of copsewoods and retired glens, that a per-
son is enabled to comprehend the meaning of a proverbial

companied by all the little feathered choiristers within reach
of its note;-The air seems to vibrate with the sound.-
As to our migrating birds, the statement in the following
table is founded on the observations of ten years:
