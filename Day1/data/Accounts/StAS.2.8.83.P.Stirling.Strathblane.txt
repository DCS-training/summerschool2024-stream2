Ireland.

                     III.-POPULATION.
The average number of baptisms, 1729, 1730, and 1731, was
26.The average number for the years 1829, 1830, and 1831,
was 24.  If this be a fair criterion of the proportion of the popu-
lation at these two periods, the parish must have been rather more
populous a century ago, before the introduction of a large print-
field and two bleachfields, than it is at present. This excess in
the ancient numbers must have arisen from the great subdivision
of farms, and the multitude of cottaries with which the parish then
abounded.
  From the enlargement of farms and the decay of cottaries, the
population decreased.
             In 1755 the population amounted to 797
                1795,      .        .        .  620

                1841,    .        .        .   1045

The recent increase is occasioned by the enlargement of the
manufacturing establishments, which require a great number of
hands.
  The yearly average of births for the seven years ending Whit-
sunday 1831, was 7 2/7; of deaths, do. 14; of marriages, do. 7 2/7.
  Three families of independent fortune reside for the greater part
of the year in the parish.
  There are seventeen proprietors of land of the yearly value of
