parish, near the River Luce. It was the property and residence of
the Lyns of Larg.
	The Castle of Craig-caffie is still entire. It is not a large
building, and has been converted into a farm-house. It has been
surrounded by a fosse, but could never have been a place of much
strength. It was the residence and property of the Nelsons of
Craig-caffi a family now extinct.

			III.--POPULATION.

	The population by the return to Dr Webster was	       1513
         In the Old Statistical Account,                              1450
	By census 1821,					       2386
         By census 1831,--males, 1164--females, 1357,                 2521
The population is still on the increase. By a census taken by
myself, it now amounts to 2684. The increase chiefly arises from
the town of Stanraer extending its suburbs within the bounds of
this parish. About 600 reside in villages, the rest in the country.
	The yearly average of births, as far as inserted in the parish register, is    52
	The average of marriages for the same time,		      		       19
	No register of deaths has been kept in the parish.
	By the census taken by myself, there are of the

	Number of illegitimate births during the last three years, 22.
	Amusements.--In the winter season, curling and skating are very
common amusements. During hard frost, some of our lochs pre-
sent a very gay and animating appearance. The skater performs
his evolutions,--the stone thunders along the ice amid the cheers
of the spectators,--the graceful forms of the fair move up and
down on the slippery promenade, giving additional interest to the
scelle. Curling levels all distinctions,--the laird and the labourer,
the master and the servant, the clergyman and the clown, are all
on an equality at this game. The late mild winters have render-
ed less frequent the enjoyment of these amusements.
	Character of the People.--The tenantry of Inch enjoy, in a
considerable degree, the comforts and advantages of society.
They are, in general, well-informed, moral and religious. Some
of them are well versed in historic lore. I recollect of one man,
