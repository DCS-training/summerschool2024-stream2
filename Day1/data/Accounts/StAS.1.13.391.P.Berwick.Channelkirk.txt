a round or oval figure, and are called rings by the com-

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The chief advantage of
this situation is a contiguity to the public road, which leads
from Edinburgh to London.  It is kept in excellent repair
by the money collected at the toll bars, and by the statute-
labour commuted into money, according to the number of
servants and horses kept by the farmers; without this,
improvement of every kind would have been impracticable.
The disadvantages of our situation are, the coldness of our
climate, and consequently our frequent cold and wet har-
vests.  Were the practice of enclosing land and planting
more general, the climate would be considerably improved.
Clumps of fir and white wood, judiciously disposed on the
heights, would shelter our flocks from the storms of winter,
and defend our habitations from the N. and N. W. winds,
to which they are at present much exposed.  Our landed
gentlemen are beginning to see the advantages of enclosing
and planting; about 500 acres are already enclosed, and I
doubt not but this improvement will advance with conside-
rable rapidity.  This part of the county of Berwick, from
the number of sheep which it supports, and its vicinity to
the public road, seems well calculated for the establishment
of an woollen manufacture; and from the present flou-
rishing state of that which was established many years ago
at Galashiels, the Noblemen and gentlemen of Lauderdale
might promise themselves the highest advantages from a
similar erection in the neighbourhood of Lauder.
