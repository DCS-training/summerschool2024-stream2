   The number of children born in the parish is, communibus
annis, about 60.  The marriages seldom exceed 12.  Indeed,
some years, they are not above half that number.  With re-
gard to funerals, no regular account of them has been hither-
to kept in the parish.

   Villages.-The principal village in the parish is MILTON,
which stands on the sea coast.  In the year 1781, there were
46 families, containing 170 persons, in this village.  Their
number is at present on the increase.  About 30 years ago,
three fishing boats belonged to Milton.  Six men went out to
sea with each boat; who caught haddocks, whitings, cod, ling,
skate, turbot, and common flukes, or flounders, in great abund-
ance, which they fold at moderate prices.  For several years
past, there has been but one boat employed in the white fish-
ing; nor has that boat been successful.  The reduction of the
fishing boats, and of the number of hands that went to sea
with them, is without doubt, a real loss to the country.  It
leaves no foundation for a nursery of seamen, and prevents
the inhabitants from enjoying that abundant supply of excel-
lent food, with which the sea is stored.
   These inconveniences might, however, be in a great mea-
sure remedied.  The fishermen are so poor, in general, that
though six of them join their little stocks together, they can-
