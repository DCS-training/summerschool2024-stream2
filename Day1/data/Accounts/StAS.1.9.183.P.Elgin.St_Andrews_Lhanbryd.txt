able to fix the price for the year.  Although the city of
Edinburgh, and the distillers, may be supposed to purchase
the whole grain of the Haddington market, yet, since the
establishment of small stills in the north, it is evident the
situation of this country would admit of such a weekly
market on a small scale at Elgin, and it would require no
great exertion of the inginuity, or attention of the country
gentlemen, to form and support an establishment so obviously
patriotic.-Although the people of Teindland are at liberty
to choose any church most convenient, they are bound to
a mill in then own parish of Elgin, and besides it, there
are 8 mills with which the parish is connected.-By the
quantity of potato, and alterations in the mode of living,
it is certain there is not so much meal consumed in the
country as was formerly.  The people in general murmur
greatly on account of mill exactions and services; perhaps,
therefore, it would be more advantageous for the proprie-
tors of mills to apportion their present rent on the lands of
their thirlage, than it may be at any future period, when
this measure, according to the practice of more highly cul-
tivated countries, may be universally adopted.
