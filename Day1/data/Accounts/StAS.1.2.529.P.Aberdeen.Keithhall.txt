tremely difficult to render it navigable.  But if a  canal were
carried along the side of that river, for 3 miles, a navigation
might be carried, to Inverury.-With little expence the Ury
could be rendered navigable, as its fall, for 12 miles, count-
ing its windings, does not probably exceed 30 feet.  Both
these rivers are apt to overflow the adjacent grounds.  The 
greatest unundation was in 1768.  Another, not much less,
took place in 1774.  In 1789, though the flood was not near-
ly so great, the Don overflowed its banks eleven times during 
the harvest season.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The Earl of Kintore is patron.-
The stipend is nearly 89 bolls of meal and bear, and L. 43: 13: 5
in money.-The church and manse were built in 1771 and
1772, at a place in the centre of the district, called Legate, so
named, because the Pope's Legace stayed there all night, (at a
small chapel, which still retains the name of Monk's Hillock,)
the night before the great battle of Harlaw: as Legate's den,
in the chapel of Garioch, was the place, where he in vain at-
tempted to reconcile the contending parties.
   In this district there are 38 Quakers, 3 Seceders, 2 Metho-
dists, and 10 Episcopalians.  The rest are of the established
church.

   Population.-The population of these parishes has de-
creased since the year 1750, and even since the present incum-
bent was settled.  The return to Dr Webster, was 828 fouls
in Keith-Hall, and 429 in Kinkell, two thirds of which, or
286, being united to Keith-Hall, would make the total popula-
tion of the district, at that time, about 1114 souls; whereas
from 1778 to 1782, there were only 900 persons of all ages,
viz. 230 in Kinkell, and 670 in Keith-Hall: and at Whit-
Sundav 1782, the farmers in Keith-Hall parish having entered
