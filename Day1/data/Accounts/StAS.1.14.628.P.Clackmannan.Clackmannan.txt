   The Devon iron works are within 3 English miles of
the port and harbour of Alloa, where the produce and
manufactures of these works are intended to be shipped;
and from which, by a retour carriage, the proprietors can
easily bring any supplies of iron-stone, iron-ores lime-
stone, timber, or any other materials that may be ne-
cessary*.

*This undertaking must already have cost a large sum of money, al-
though as yet only in its infant state:  but the advantages that must re-

in particular, give great cause to with for its extention and prosperity.
The situation has many peculiar advantages.  The whole country around
it abounds in coal, as well as in strata of iron-stone; and a vein of rich

bouring hills.  There is also a very fine lime-stone rock, within a few
miles of it, lately discovered in the Menstry hills, belonging to Major
General Abercromby of Tullibody.  So that when we add to all these
advantages, the practicability of cutting a navigable canal to join the river
Forth, we may reasonably expect that this undertaking will prove suc-
cessful.
   +In the year 1755, the number of souls in the parish of Clackmannan
was, according to Dr. Webster's report, 1913; so that there is an in-
crease since that period of 615.  This may easily be accounted for, from
the number of people who, for many years, crowded to this place, in
order to be employed at the distilleries.  It is probable, that the number
of colliers has also increased; of these, there are in the present list 605
fouls.  Previous to the year 1788, the numbers in the parish were much
greater than in 1791; for when the distilleries gave over working, a
