     CANONGATE PARISH.

   OF the 6200  inhabitants of this district, about 1200 are
under ten years of age.  Of the 1552 families, about 1200
prosess the established religion; 80 belong to the Episcopal
church, 114 are Seceders, 18 Roman Catholics, and the remain-
ing 140 either sectaries of different denominations, or families
who will give no account of their religious persuasion.  The
population of this parish appears to be pretty stationary for a
good number of years past; but a considerable change has ta-
ken place with respect to the rank and the opulence of the in-
habitants.  It was formerly remarkable for the number of no-
ble and genteel families residing in it.  But of late, since the
increase of the buildings in the New-Town and south districts,
the number of these has considerably deminished.  The inte-
rest of the Canongate, as a burgh, has also been hurt by the
alteration of the carriage-road to Leith, which has cut off, in
a great measure, the revenue it derived from the customs at
the Watergate.
   The burgh of Canongate, being a vassalage to Edinburgh,
is governed by a baron bailie, and two resident magistrates
annually chosen by the Town-Council of that city.  Their juris-
diction extends beyond the bounds of parish, to the east-
side of the Pleasance, and to the town of North Leith.  They
are exoffecto justices of peace.
   There are two ministers of the parish of Canongate.  One is
presented by the Crown, and the other by the joint body of
the magistrates, kirk sesion, heritors, and deacons of craft of
the eight incorporations.  The settlement of the last, owing
to the number of electors, (about 400), has generally been
attended with much difficulty and litigation.
