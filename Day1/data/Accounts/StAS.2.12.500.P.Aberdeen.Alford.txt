Foudland slates, which, for lightness and durability, are about equal
to those of Eisdale.  It is a finely proportioned house, having nar-
row galleries on three sides, and the whole fitted up and paint-
ed with simplicity and beauty.  The stair for the galleries is in
a building outside the line of the wall; and as the ceiling is flat
and not too lofty, there is none of that irregular vertical echo which
makes it impossible to hear a speaker at any considerable distance,
in so many of our public buildings constructed with too lofty roofs.
   There is a substantial mansion-house at Haughton, the seat of
the principal heritor, built of finely dressed granite, and of modern
construction.  There is also a suitable mansion-house at Breda.
   There are three meal mills in the parish, with attached drying
kilns, built of ruble stone and lime, and roofed with slate.  The
farm-houses and steadings are all built of durable stone, of which
there is everywhere a good supply near at hand.  Most of them are
with thorough lime; but some are only with clay and sneckpinned
with lime.  Many of them are roofed with slate, which is getting
more into use; but a large part is stob-thatched with straw, and a
few with heath, which makes a more durable covering.

   The increase of population since 1801 is exclusively owing to
the improvement and extension of agriculture.
   The whole population resides in the country; the only place
having the name of village, consisting of about a dozen cottages,
dispersed over a space of three-quarters of a mile.
