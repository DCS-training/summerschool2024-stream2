   Salt.-There are 9 salt-pans at Methil, and 7 at Wester
Wemyss.  These works have been long carried on, and
much salt is made at them, both for land-sale and exporta-
tion.

   Manufactures, Commerce, etc.-Almost every substantial
family used annually to make a few pieces of good linen,
from yarn of their own spinning, which was wrought by
weavers in the parish, and generally bleached by the pro-
prietors themselves, and then sold in the public markets
held in this and the neighbouring parishes for the purpose.
In this way the weavers had been employed time imme-
morial till about the year 1750, that some in Easter
Wemyss began to manufacture linen themselves, and ever
since this business has been extended and improved.  The
linen now made is generally well known for its quality
and fineness.  Most of it is made from Scotch flax, the
greatest part of which is spun in the parish.  It is thought
by manufacturers to be superior to any in the country;
and in confirmation of this, it may here be observed, that
the premiums given by the trustees for linen and sheeting
were adjudged for 5 years successively to manufacturers in
this parish; to one in the years 1785 and 1786, and to an-
other in the 1787, 1788, and 1789.  Since the latter pe-
riod, the number of looms has increased, and the manu-
factory varied; part of the looms being now employed in
weaving checks and ticks for manufacturers in this and the
neighbouring parishes.  There are about 120 looms em-
ployed.
