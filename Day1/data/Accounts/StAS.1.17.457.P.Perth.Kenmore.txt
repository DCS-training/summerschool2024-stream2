of Weem and Killin; after which it continues on both sides
to the west end of the loch, on the north side; and nearly
as far on the south.  In a north-west direction from Killin,
which is situated at the west end of Loch Tay, there is a
beautiful and sequestred vale, called Glenlochay, a consider-
able part of which is in the parish of Kenmore, although some
places of it are no less than 28 miles from the parish church.
Such of the inhabitants of this glen, and other parts of the
parish, as are adjacent to Killin, attend divine service there.
They have seats in the church of Killin; and when any repairs
are wanted, either for church or manse, they perform car-
riages, etc. as were they parishioners.  Their elders have a
seat in the kirk-session, and their poor are chiefly supplied
from the funds at Killin.  It does not, however, appear,
that their lands were formerly annexed, ouoad sacra, to that
parish.  To Kenmore, also, belongs a small part of Glen-
quaich, which lies to the south of the parish, and is separat-
ed from it by a hill 5 miles over.  The inhabitants of this
glen depend for church privileges on the mission of Amul-
ree.

   Lakes and Rivers.-The only lake worth, mentioning is
Loch Tay which is 15 miles in length, and, In general, a
mile in breadth, but two miles where broadest.  It is laid to
be in many places 100 fathoms deep.  This lake, which
seldom or never freezes, abounds with salmon, pike, perch,
cels, charr, and other trouts.  The salmon are of an excel-
lent quality, and are found clean at all seasons.  Lord Bread-
albane has the privilege of fishing them in the loch the
whole year*.  The principal river is the Tay, which issues
