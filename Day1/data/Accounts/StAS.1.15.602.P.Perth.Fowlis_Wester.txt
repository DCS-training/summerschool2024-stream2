nerally the best natural soil; whereas, all the farms that pay
a low rent per acre, have still a considerable quantity of
ground either waste or very little cultivated.  The richest
lands are in the South East quarter of the parish, especially
such as are liable to be overflowed by the water of the Pow,
or had been formerly covered with it before the drain was
formed.  Of these, there may be some hundred acres, so en-
riched with mud and slime, as constantly to yield plentiful
crops without any manure, provided the season be modera-
tely dry.  Tradition says, 36 bolls of oats have been pro-
duced on an acre of that richest land; this, however, is much
doubted, as the greatest quantity produced of late years is
16 bolls, and that too very rarely, and only when the sea-
son is peculiarly favourable;  for the average produce of the
best land cannot be reckoned more than 8 1/2 or 9 bolls.  E-
ven this very rich land requires a boll of seed to an acre;
for though a few pecks will fill the ground with straw, yet
thin sowing never ripens equally, and if very thin, the great-
est part will not ripen at all.
   On an acre of ordinary good dry land, 5 firlots, or rather
18 pecks of oats are sown; of bear or barley, sometimes 10,
but more frequently 12 pecks.  The produce of the oats is
5, and of the barley 6 bolls, at an average.  A crop of clo-
ver and rye-grass yields from 100 to 250 stones of hay, which
in August may sell at 4 d. in the following April, May, or
June, some times at 10 d. a stone; but the average price for
a course of years, is 5 1/2 d.  The most common mode of rota-
tion of crops observed by the best farmers on the richest lands
is, 1. oats; 2. green crop of turnip or potatoes; 3. barley and
grass feeds; 4. hay; 5. pasture.  On lands of inferior qua-
lity the modes are exceedingly various, but the most com-
mon, is, 1. oats; 2. barley; 3. green crop with dung; 4. bar-
ley with grass feeds; 5. hay: 6. and 7. pasture.  The chief
