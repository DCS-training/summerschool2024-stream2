three gentlemen were born in the parish and have left a me
morial worthy of record.

   Price of Labour and Provisions, etc.-Servan's wages have
risen a third within these few years.  Female servants who
got 20 s. per half year now get 30 s. or more; male servants,
who formerly got L. 2, or L. 2: 10: 0 per half year, now
get L. 3: 3: 0, or L. 3: 10: c; some get L. 4.  A day la-

The price of pourlty is pretty reasonable; butcher meat is 2 1/2 d.
per lb. when plentiful; when scarce, it rises considerably.

one of them there is a petrifying water, which drops from
the roof.  In another on the eastern shore, according to tra-
dition, a hermit lived.  The fuel here is peat and turf; and
these are scarce, as much of the moor ground has been con-

The air is reckoned very wholesome.  More flax is raised
than formerly; and the ground is proper for it.  A lint-mill
erected in the parish would be a farther encouragement.  The
farmers bring their lime from Whitehaven or Ireland, and
pay 1 s. 2 d. per Carlisle bushel, which is three Winchester
bushels.  The trustees are making every exertion to put the
