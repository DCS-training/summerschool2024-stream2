     The Statistical Account.

There is an established schoolmaster in Sprouston.  Of late,
the heritors have augmented his salary from 100 merks to
100 pounds Scots.  He has, at a medium, forty scholars, in-
structed in reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and
mensuration.  His wages are very low; a shilling a quarter
for reading, and eighteen pence for writing and arithmetic.
There is a schoolmaster at Hadden, paid only the interest of
1000 pounds Scots, arising from 1000 merks, mortified by
Lady Yester, and afterwards augmented by Sir Gilbert Elliot
of Stobs, then proprietor of Hadden.
   The tenants of Lempetlaw contribute to obtain a teacher
of their children, being too remote from the parish school.
   There are three alehouses in the parish; one at the ferry-
boat, one at a toll bar, another lately in Sprouston; yet little
frequented by the inhabitants, who are of a sober industrious
character, yet complained of as a haunt for vagrants.  With-
in there twenty years, the Duke of Roxburgh has built eight
farmers houses, with office-houses for them, and many cot-
tages; the Duke of Buccleugh six farm houses; the laird of
Hadden three; Sir G. Douglas two.
   There has been no person in the parish confined to jail or
corporally punished during my incumbency, except a few wo-
men, who rescued a young man unjustly pressed, during the
war carried on in defence of our colonies.
   Farmers now prefer generally carrying on their husbandry
by cottagers, who are obliged to furnish a female shearer to
hoe turnips and to work during hay time, to hired servants,
who are dieted in their houses.  There are several ruinous
houses in the village of Sprouston, chiefly the Duke's cottars.
There is an excellent freestone quarry on the Duke of Rox-
burgh's estate, about half a mile from Sprouston, of great uti-
lity to the gentry in the neighbourhood, and to the town of
Kelso.  The cart-load of wall stones has been raised from 4 d.
