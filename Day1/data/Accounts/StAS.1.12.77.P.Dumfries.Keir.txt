rapid progress in this corner of the country within a few
years last past.  It is purchased at a very low price, and a
small quantity of it is sufficient, not only to intoxicate, but
even to make a man mad.  Its pernicious effects upon the
morals, the industry, and the constitutions of those who are
addicted to it, must be visible to every sober observer.

   Roads.-The principal road in the parish is in very indif-
ferent repair.  A part of it is still in its natural state, and
those parts of it, that have been repaired, were done in a 
very superficial manner.  The conversion of the statute-la-

yearly.-The parish school is inconveniently situated, being
about 2 miles too near the upper or west end of the parish,
by which the lower or east end is in a great measure deprived
of the benefit of it.  The number of scholars, in the winter
season, is between 30 and 40, during the rest of the year they
are not so numerous, many of them being employed in herd-
