from a cause that well accounts for it, in minds which have
no incitement, from vanity, of the poor desire of imposing
on the world, to assume the appearance of fortitude which
they do not feel.  it is the consequence of religion; of 
their firm belief of a better state of existence; and of their
hope of what a good man will in that state enjoy for ever.
Patriotism surely cannot with for a more substantial trea-

desirous to promote, than that the purifying influence of
true religion should prevail amongst them; nor deprecate a
greater evil, than the petulant presumptuous licentiousness,
which tolerates no reasonable, no virtuous restraints, which
holds these up to riducule, and labours to make them disre-
garded.
