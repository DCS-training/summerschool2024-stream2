rage expense of 10d. per ell, and have sunk upwards of 40,000
ells of drains.
  The estate of Cullerley contains 2886 imperial acres, where of
1001 are arabe, 89 meadow or hough ground, 296 moss, and
1500 uncultivated, including its proportion of the hill of Fare.
Improvement is going on there also with considerable spirit.  The
duration of leases in this parish is generally nineteen years; but
many of the old leasis were double that extent.  Most of the
farms are substantially inclosed, and almost every farm-house is
substantial and convenient.  The style of farming has been im-
proved exceedingly within the last forty years.  The seven years
shift is chiefly practised.  Turnips and sown grasses are raised in
abundance.  Lime is much used, and the use of bone manure be-
gins to be adopted at the rate of twenty-five bushels to the acre,
and it succeeds well.  Some farms are in a high state of im-
provement particularly the farm of Wester Culfosie, lately in the
natural possesion of the proprietor of Echt.  There are thirty-five
mills in the parish for thrashing grain.
