defeated.  This was shortly after followed by an incursion into
Scotland, by a large army led by the Duke of Norfolk, which,
marching up the Tweed, destroyed many towns and villages.
Among the latter, was the village of Sprouston, then called Long-
Sprouston, extending probably, with straggling cottages, as far west
as Burnfoot, which tradition says it once did.  Tradition reports
besides, that hearths and foundations of houses and kitchen uten-
sils have been ploughed up in the field above the Scurry rock;
from which, it would appear that the village was formerly of
greater extent on that side also.
  The barony of Lempitlaw, which forms the southern division
of the parish, was originally a separite parish, but was, at a time
which has not been ascertained, united to that of Sprouston.  Part
of the ruins of its church were, till recently, to be seen in the church-
yard, which still continues to be the burying-place for that part of
the parish.
  Parochial Registers.--The oldest session records now extant
bear date from 1650 till 1656, and seem to have been pretty ful-
ly and regularly kept; but they are now in a very imperfect and
decayed state.  The records subsequent to that period, with the
exception of one interval between 1656 and 1691, are almost entire.
  Eminent Ment.--Tbe late Dr Andrew Thomson was ordained
minister of this parish in 1802, and translated to Perth in 1808.
It is said of him, that when the alarm of invasion by the French
was raised by fire-beacons on the neighbouring heights, he head-
ed a numerous body of volunteers from the parish, and led tbem
to Kelso, the appointed rendezvous for this district.  This is the
more remarkable, as the parishioners were supposed to be much
infected with French principles.

                       III.--POPULATION.
  The population would appear from the last Statistical Account,
and from other circumstances, to have continued very nearly the
same in amount, for the last century.  Its present amount is some-
what less than 1400.  In the village of Sprouston it is 420 ; in
that of Lempitlaw 130.
