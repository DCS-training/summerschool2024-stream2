meal, potatoes, and fish of various kinds, of which there is usually
an abundant supply. In the latter article, few parishes are pos-
sessed of equal advantages, for, in addition to the opportunities of
obtaining white fish of excellent quality when the weather is mo-
derate, each family lays in a regular stock of from one to three
barrels of curred herrings, according to the number of persons of
which it consists. This, with potatoes, milk, and a moderate
quantity of bread, together with a little animal food occasionally,
forms a wholesome and nourishing diet at all seasons.

community so circumstanced, the great wonder is, that they do

have more recently been applied, by extending, as far as possible,
the improved system of education, and providing, additional facili-
ties of religious instruction and pastoral superintendence over the
more remote and destitute districts; a system which, even in its
infancy, is already, producing a marked improvement on the ha-

     Upon the whole, the peasantry may, be said to possess a tole-
