Hume and Dr Robertson had indeed, a very few years before,
sold some of their works; the one, a part of the History of 
L. 600;-each 2 vols. in quarto.
   In 1783-The value of literary property was carried higher
by the Scots than ever was known among any people.  Da-
vid Hume received L. 5000 for the remainder of his History of
Britain; and Dr Robertson, for his second work, received
L. 4500.  In sermon-writing the Scots have also excelled;
and, although, in 1763, they were reckoned remarkably de-
ficient in this species of composition, yet, 1783, a minister
of Edinburgh, wrote the most admired sermons that ever were
published, and obtained the highest price that ever was given
for any work of the kind.
   N. B.  The merit of these sermons obtained for Dr Blair a
pension of L.200 per annum.
   Previous to 1763, the Scots had made no very distinguished
figure in literature as writers, particularly in the departments
of History and Belles Lettres.  Lord Kames had, in the year
before, (in 1762), published his Elements of Criticism; Hume
and Robertson had made their first essays in the line of Histo-
ry, a short time before, as mentioned above.
   In 1783-The Scots had distinguished themselves in a re-
markable manner in many departments of literature; and,
within the short period of twenty years, Hume, Robertson,
Kames, Orme, Dalrymples (Sir David and Sir John), Hen-
ry, Tyslers (father and son), Watson, Reid, Beattie, Oswald,
Ferguson, Smith, Monboddo (Buruet), Gregories (father and
son), Cullen, Homes (poet and phtsician), Monros (father and
son), Black, Duncan, Hunter, Stewart (father and son,) Stuart
(Dr Gilbert), Blair, Mackenzie, Campbell, Gerard, Miller,
Macpherson, Brydone, Moore, Sinellie, Mickle, Gillies, Adam,
