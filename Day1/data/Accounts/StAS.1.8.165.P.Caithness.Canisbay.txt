cavern, (or Glupe as it is called,) at about 30 yards from the
beach.  It stretches down to a level with the sea, whole waves
are seen pouring into it, by a narrow opening at the bottom.
The sea is often exceedingly tempestuous, around the island in
the winter months.  The coast on the west is exceedingly bold.
The tremenduous elevation of the billows, that beat against
it during a storm, from that quarter, exceeds all power of de-
scription.  Although the rocks are only inferior to those of
Dungisbay Head, the spray is tossed above their loftiest sum-
mits, and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the op-
posite shore.  A reservoir, in a commodious situation, is made
to receive it, together with the rain which the clouds im-
part; and hence, a mill is kept going in the winter months,
for grinding the grain of the island.  The agitation of the
spray is often so great, that the water in the spring wells be-
comes brakish, and a salt taste prevails in the air.  The tide
is supposed to rise to the height of 6 fathoms from lowest ebb.
During a storm from the west, the rise of the sea, on that side,
is more than 2 fathoms higher, than on the east of the island.
From the antiseptic influence of the salt particles, perpetually
floating in the air, mummies were preserved for a great
length of years, and were wont to be exhibited as curiosities,
in a chapel situated in the island.  The mummies are now
destroyed, and the chapel is unroofed and mouldering into ruin.

   Pentland Frith.-The Pentland Frith is reckoned 24 miles
in length, and varies from 4 to 5 leagues in breadth.  It
has the Orkney Isles on the N. and the coasts of Caithness on
the S., and forms a communication between the German and
the Atlantic Oceans.  In the mouth of the frith, and nearly half
way between Dungisbay Head and the Orkneys, are situated
the Pentland Skerries.  These are two small uninhabited
islands, the one considerably larger than the other, and stretch-
