     of Polwart.

   Village; Climate, and Diseases.-The village of Polwarth is
situated on very wet, and even swampy ground, so that al-
most in every house they have a hole dug to collect the un-
der water, which requires to be often, emptied in wet wea-
ther; and yet the inhabitants are very healthy, being neither-
subject to rheumatic nor aguish complaints.  The present
incumbent, who has been minister of the parish 24 years,
does not remember any epidemical distemper prevailing in
the village*.-The houses are very much scattered, not a-
bore 2 or 3 at most being situated close to each other.  It is
probably owing to this circumstance, that epidemic distem-
pers do not spread.-In the middle of the village there are
two thorn trees, at about 6 yards distance from each other,
around which, it was formerly the custom, for every new
married pair, with their company, to dance in a ring; from
hence the song of Polworth on the Green.  But this custom
has fallen much into disuse, there not having been above a
instances of it these 20 years.

   Manner of Living.-Almost every householder, along
with his house, rents a small portion of land, called an acre,
but which is, often nearer two.  With the produce thereof,
together with what they can spare from their gardens, and
the use of a considerable extent of muir, which they enjoy
by the indulgence of the proprietor, they are enabled to keep
one cow each, and most of them what is called a follower.
As the rents of their small possessions are very moderates
they live comfortably, and seldom remove, most of the fa-
millies having been in the village for several generations

*In autumn 1790, an epidemic fever and sore throat, which
was very prevalent in Dunse, and in every village round about,
made its appearance in two different houses in Polwarth at, the
same time, but spread no farther.
