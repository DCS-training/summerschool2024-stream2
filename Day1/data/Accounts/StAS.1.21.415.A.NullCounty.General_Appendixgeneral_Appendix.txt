     The Statistical Account.

   In the last year included in Table III there was an ex-
traordinary collection for the poor, which amounted to about
30 L. one half of which was given by the heritors; the rest
from farmers and substantial tradesmen.
   In regard to Table III. it must be observed that the num-
bers supplied are taken from the treasurer's books; in
which, when a family is relieved, the name of the head of
the family only is marked; so that the number of indivi-
duals relieved may be taken at lear at double of what is
stated in the table.
   Besides supplying the poor, the salary of the kirksession
clerk and the kirk officer or bellman, together with that of
the Presbytery and Synod, are all paid out of the poors
funds; amounting to about 30 shillings yearly; and this
constitutes the whole expenses of management.
   Some time ago an heritor in a country parish brought an
action before the Court of Session, in regard to the above
misapplication of the poors funds; and the Court, upon
strict legal principles, found that it was a misapplication; the
funds being, in intention, destined for other purposes.  The
result was, that the clergyman and kirk session abandoned
the management of the poors funds, which of course de-
solved upon the heritors.  The consequence of which was
the necessity of appointing an heritors clerk, at the expence
probably of 5 L. yearly salary; with the establishment of a
poors rate, which had no place before, and which in all
likelihood has doubled the expence.  It is probable, there-
fore, that the above misapplication will continue to go on,
upon the authority of custom, notwithstanding of the de-
cision; and it will not rashly be challenged by the heritors.
   There are 11 heritors, 6 of whom constantly or generally
reside.  Landed estates within the parish, (exclusive of mine-
