     Statistical Account

some have farms, and so may be reckoned among the
farmers.

   Horses, Cows, and Sheep.-the horses are of various
kinds; some of a Low Country breed, some of the real
Highland kind, and many of a cross breed between the 
two.  There were some Arabian stone horses brought
to the neighbourhood, and one of them to this parish,
some years ago, which hurt the breed very much; for,
being of a delicate kind, they do not answer either the 
climate or the keeping, so well as other horses.  By far
the greatest number, and those that suit the country
best, are real Highlanders; but they are here rather
smaller in general than the ordinary size, owing to the 
bad keeping.  Scarcely the half of the number of horses
needed in the parish are reared in it, but bought at the 
markets on the N. side of Lochsine, by jockies, and sold
here to the farmers.  Their prices are various, from
5 L. to 15 L.
   The cows are neither so large nor so handsome as they
are in most of the neighbouring parishes, especially on the 
N. side of Lochfine; and this is also owing to overstock-
ing the farms, and housing them at night: for they are
all in the house at night, young and old, I mean with
the common tenants.  Some also keep a few Low Coun-

too hurst the bread.  The average value of tidy cows
may be about 3 L. 10 s.; of dry cows about 2 L. 10 s.
   The sheep are almost all of the black faced kind, and
are rather diminutive too, owing to the same cause that
was assigned for black cattle being undersized.  Of them,
however, there is not a very principal stock in the pa-
rish, as all pastures here are mixed pastures; the gra-
