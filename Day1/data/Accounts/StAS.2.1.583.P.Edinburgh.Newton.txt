   Friendly Societies.-Friendly societies have long existed here,
though, unfortunately, it cannot be said that they are in a flourishing
condition. The members have not been enlightened enough to avail
themselves of the knowledge which has been brought to bear on this
subject, such as the Highland Society's tables, to form the basis of
safe calculation, in order that the contributions may be made to cor-
respond to the risks to be run, according to the age of the entrants;
and the consequence has been, that, being founded on erroneous
principles, after flourishing for a while by reason of the great ma-
jority of the members being young at their first formation, they
begin at length to find the expenditure exceed the income, since
the members, when advanced in years, consume more than the
previous payments can afford; and when it comes to be seen that
the funds are undergoing rapid diminution, the alarm is taken,
and no new members enter, leaving no alternative but at length
to dissolve the Society, as no longer able to meet its engagements.
This is a frequent consummation, and it comes to be a great hard-
ship that, when the members require such assistance most, and af-
ter they have contributed for a lengthened period, it may be for the
benefit of others, they themselves are disappointed of the benefit
they ought to have enjoyed, if the society had been constituted
on right principles.
   Another cause of failure is the knavery of the office-bearers, by
whom the funds in some instances have been embezzled, and the
ruin of the society has thus been prematurely consummated.
Even the prosperity of the societies in some cases has proved their
ruin, for when the funds have accumulated to a considerable
amount, the cupidity of the more reckless members has been ex-
cited, by whom a proposition has been brought forward and car-
ried, by the support of a majority, that the society should be dis-
solved and the funds divided, whereby gross injustice is inflicted,
since in such cases all share alike, however unequal may have
been the amount of their contributions, and those who are depen-
dent upon it from sickness or frailty are defrauded of their vested
right in its benefits. The consequence of all this has been, that
such Societies have come into disrepute. The writer endea-
voured in these circumstances to have them organized on the
true principle of every one paying for his own risk; but as the
more elderly would thus have to pay increased rates, the at-
tempt proved unsuccessful from the opposition of these parties. It
is to be feared also that the benevolent intervention of the Le-
gislature to prevent the abuses alluded to, and to induce a better
