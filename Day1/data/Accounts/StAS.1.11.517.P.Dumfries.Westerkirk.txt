hill.  From the confluence of the Esks, the river, by a va-
riety of beautiful curves, runs through the parish toward the
S. E. for the space of 7 miles, till it reaches Dowglen-cleugh;
and then passes along the N. side of the parish, nearly in the
same direction, till it reaches a place named Craig-cleugh; a
rivulet which divides the parish from that of Langholm on
the S., as Dowglen-cleugh does on the N. side of the Esk.
Many burns, or rivulets, fall into the Esk within the bounds
of the parish.  From the hills on the S. side of the river there
are 13, and from those on the N. 9, besides the Megget and
Stennis water.  In the S. side of a ridge of mountains, the
summits of which are the line of division between the county
of Dumsries, in this direction, and that of Roxburgh or Ti-
viotdale, the Megget and Stennis water have their sources.
They are divided in their courses by a ridge of hills, and fed
in their progress, with a variety of streamlets from the neigh-
bouring mountains; and running southward for 6 miles, the
Stennis water, near a place named the Crooks, joins the Meg-
get, which passes on in the same direction for about half a
mile, and falls into the Esk in the neighbourhood of Wauk-
mill.  The Esk, the Megget, and the Stennis water abound
with trout; and salmon were also taken in the Esk in great
numbers, till the late Dr. Graham of Netherbie built a bay
across the river, for the professed purpose of procuring water
for working the mills, which he was then erecting in the
neighbourhood of Langtoun; but since that time scarcely any
salmon get up the Esk, excepting when it happens to be greatly
flooded.

sixth within these 40 years, as appears from the following

within the parish of Westerkirk, called Stauridge.
