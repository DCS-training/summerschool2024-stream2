King of Scotland.  But although there island were thus,
ceded, the Norwegians still asserted their right to them,
and often possessed them, until the year 1470, when
James III. of Scotland married Margaret, daughter to the
King of Denmark, with whom they again passed to the
Crown of Scotland, in lieu of her dowry; and upon the
birth of her son (James IV.) they were finally ceded;
which was afterwards confirmed, when James VI. of Scot-
land married Ann daughter of the King of Denmark.
These islands having been so long and repeatedly in the
possession of the Danes and Norwegians, many of the
names of places and persons are derived from the Danish
or Scandinavian language.

   Name and Situation.-Stromness and Sandwick are
names to be found in Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland.
The first of these may derive its name from Strom, or
Straum, and Ness; this last meaning an extended point of
land, and Strom the strong side off that point.  The parish
of Sandwick, as well as the parish of the same name in the
Shetland isles, of a similar situation, may derive its name
from Sand and Wick, as there is a sandy bay on the west
side of this parish, Wick signifying a bay or inlet of the
sea.  The centre of these parishes lies in latitude 58degree 59';
on the west end of the isle of Pomona, or mainland, late
the bishoprick, now the stewartry and county of Orkney,
in the Synod and County of Orkney, and in the presby-
tery of Cairston; and Stromness is the seat of the said pres-
bytery.
   There parishes are bounded by the parish of Birsay on
the N.; by the loch of Stenness on the E.; by the channel
of Hoy Sound on the S.; and by the Atlantic Ocean on
the W. Mr Murdoch Mackenzie surveyed the sea coasts
of these parishes in 1740 or 1741.
