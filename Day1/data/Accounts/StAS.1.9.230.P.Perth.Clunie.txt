     Statistical Account

see on the S. W. the W. the N. W. the N. and N. E. the
higher Grampians towards Argyleshire, Badenach and Mar
on the E. the S. E. and S. you have a view of the whole
extent of Strathmore, from the neighbourhood of Stone
hive to that of Stirling, and this great Strath, bordered
the opposite side by the Sidla and Ochil hills; beyond the
latter, you perceive the Pentlands, a little to the S. W. of
Edinburgh; and, thence directing your eye eastward to
the side of the Lomond hill at Falkland, you may descry
pretty distinctly the eastern termination of the Soutra hills,
in the neighbourhood of Haddington, rising like small blue
clouds in the verge of the horizon.  The height of Ben
achally has not been ascertained, and the elevation of its
base detracts much from its apparent altitude.  Birnam,
celebrated in the tragedy of Macbeth, stands about 5 miles
S. by W. of Ben-achally, and the height of Birnam has been
taken, 1580 feet above the level of the sea.  Supposing
this measurement to be accurate, Ben-achally should not
be overstated at 1800 feet above the same level, since, to
the naked eye, it appears considerably higher than Birnam.
   At the foot of Ben-achally, on its north side, in the fo-
rest of Clunie, (said to have been once a royal forest, and
now the property of the Duke of Atholl), lies the loch of
Ben-achally, extending about a mile from W. to E. and a-
bout half a mile from N. to S. at its west end.  Its great-
est depth 11-12 fathoms, is towards the foot of the moun-
tain; and if we compute the height of the mountain as a-
bove, the surface of the loch may be supposed not lets than
900 feet above the level of the sea.  In the loch are some
eels; and it abounds with trouts, which in general are
small.  We have seen some of them 1-2 lb. weight;
sometimes they are caught of a large size.  In a calm sum-
met evening, they spring in such numbers to the flies, that
the whole surface of the water appears to be dancing.
