been found to act as an emetic and cathartic, to a dangerous degree.
It is very common here among the winter wheats, and can scarce-
ly be separated from the grain, as the seeds of it are large and
heavy. In this district, a bitter infusion of the stalks of the barber-
ry is used with success in jaundice. Beech, ash, elm, and plane,
attain a large size. In front of Arbuthnott House, there is a fine
avenue of beeches, supposed tn bd upwards of two hundred years
old. At the bottom of the garden, on the east side, on a space of
scarcely 1000 square feet, beeches of the following size are at pre-
sent growing, and in full vigour.

			II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
	Eminent Men.--Alexander, Arbuthnott, the first Protestant
Principal of King's College and University, Aberdeen, was a na-
tive of this parish, and for some time its clergyman. He was the
second son of Andrew Arbuthnott of Pitcarles, and Elizabeth
Strathuchin, daughter of James Strathauchin, or Strachan of
Monboddo, and sister of Alexander Stratbauchin of Thornton.
Andrew Arbutbnott was fourth son of Sir Robert Arbuthnott of
Arbuthnott; so that the Principal was a grandson, not a brother
of the Baron of Arbuthnott, as Sir George Mackenzie and Spots-
wood affirm. After he had completed the regular course of study
at the University of St Andrews, he was sent to France in his
twenty-third year, where he applied to the study of, civil law for
five years under the famous Cujacius, at the University of Bourges.
