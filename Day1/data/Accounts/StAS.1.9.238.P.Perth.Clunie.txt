and eat a few juniper-berries by way of a stomachic; and
when they arrive at the parsonage of Clunie in the dusk,
they will feel an appetite for supper, after which
they may expect to enjoy very comfortable and refreshing
slumbers.  In this day's excursion, the pupil of Linnaeus will
have that general view of our Flora, which the time and
space prescribed to this memoir will not allow its author
to particularize.
   The eriophorum vaginatum and eriophorum polystachium,
(cotton-grass), whitens our mosses.  The sheep are said to
be very fond of it in the spring before it flowers, when it
is believed to be very good for them:  This is the "down
of Cana," of Ossian, and forms a beautiful fimily in his
justly-celebrated poems.  It carries a large filamentous
flower, whiter and softer than cotton, and its filament makes
an admirable object for microscopical observation.  The
menyanthes trifoliata, (marsh-trifoil), abounds on the skirts
of our lochs and mires; early in the spring, it throws up a
beautiful flower with five fringed petals: This plant is used
in decoction and infusion, and is reckoaed a good antiscor-
butic.  The athamanta meum, (spignel), here called moi-
ken or muilcionn, grows in the higher parts of the barony
of Laighwood, and in the forest of Clunie.  The High-
landers chew the root of it like liquorice or tobacco.  It is
best in winter and spring, before its radical leaves appear.
It flowers in June and July, and grows in great plenty in
some of the glens to the northward of this, particularly in
Glenshee, Glenbeg, and Glencluny, by the sides of the
Mar-road.  The root of this plant, when dried and masti-
cated, throws out strong effluvia, which are thought a
powerful antidote against contagious air, and it is recom-
mended by some in goutish and gravellish complaints.  The
vaccinium myrtillus, (blae-berry), of which excellent jam
may be made, and the fragaria, (wild straw-berry), grow
