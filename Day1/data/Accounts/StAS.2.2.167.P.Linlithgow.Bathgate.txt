   The proprietors of three-fourths of the land being non-resident,
the ordinary funds could not be expected to be adequate to the
support of the poor. The heritors made a voluntary contribution
for that end; and to make their contributions equal, they are just
according to the valued rent of their lands. The great increase in
1842 is chiefly to be ascribed to the depression of trade. The
interest is the produce of L.1100, which was left to the poor of
Bathgate by Henry Calder, Esq. of Edisto Island, Carolina, a
native of the parish, in 1620, but was only recovered by the pre-
sent minister in 1828. The other funds arise from dues on procla-
mations, mortcloths, &c.
   Prison.-Bathgate is a sheriffdom by itself, a distinction which
it probably owes to its ancient connection with the royal family of
Scotland. Practically, however, the Sheriff of the county is now
always appointed Sheriff of Bathgate too. Sheriff-courts are held
at Bathgate four times a-year. There is a small prison, compris-
ing three strong cells for criminals, and a debtors' room, the whole
government of which is in the magistrates of the burgh. It is
much too confined to be a very healthy place of confinement.
During last year (1838) there has been no person confined in it
either for debt or police offences, but upwards of twenty deserters
or persons charged with military offences, mostly for a single night,
on their route either to Glasgow or Edinburgh.
   Fairs, &c.-There are seven fairs for the sale of cattle and
horses held annually in Bathgate, the principal of which take
place on the Wednesdays after Whitsunday and Martinmas, O.S.
There are seven inns in the parish; and, altogether, 31 persons li-
censed to retail intoxicating liquors. This excessive multiplication
