tanical plant that has been observed here.  It is found
in some low damp places in the moor, that have been
under water in the winter.-The common fuel through
the greatest part of the parish is moory turf.  In Gar-
mouth, and near the sea, they use coals, the greatest
part from Sunderland.  Since the duty has happily been,
taken off, they have sold at from 22 d. to 2 s. the barrel;
which should be equal to 3 Winchester bushels heaped.
There is some moor stone in the upper part of the pa-
rish, which is used in building.  The stone that is prin-
cipally used, is taken out of a rock that runs along the
Spey for about a mile, where the post-road passes.  It
is of a red colour, and is altogether of the nature of
lime-stone.  It becomes harder according to its depth;
and it is only what is at some depth, that is hard and
durable enough to be fit for building.  Towards the top,
it is soft, and of a marly nature; some parts of it pretty
rich, and when exposed to the air and weather, it dis-
solves.  The clay that is mixed with this rock, or be-
tween the different strata of it, is also of a red colour;
and in many parts, of a marly nature, and of consider-
able strength.  Both the soft stone and the clay are laid
on the lands, by those in the immediate neighbourhood,
to great advantage.  But the quantity necessary to pro-
duce any considerable effect, has hitherto prevented those
who are at the distance of a mile, from using it.  It
seems, however, to be worth the trouble; and it is pro-
bable, it will be more used as its value is known.  The
great post road enters this parish at the Boat of Bog,
and passes through the middle of it to Elgin.  The fare
for the passage here over the Spey is for a single per-
son 1/2 d.; for a man and horse 2 d.; for a chaise and
pair 2 s. 6 d.; for a horse and cart 2 d., etc.  When the
