score of wedders.  The ewes, for the last 3 years, have fetch-
ed from 9 s 6 d. to 12 s 6 d. a head.  The whole of these sheep
are not fed on the farms; about 20 score of wedder hogs be-
ing annually brought from Tweeddale, at from 8 s. to 10 s a
head.  Scarce any black cattle are bred here; perhaps 6 or 8,
in a season, which sell from L. 3 to L. 5.

   Smearing Sheep.-Smearing is a practice, which universal-
ly prevails throughout all Lamer-moor.  A composition is
made of tar and butter, or oil; and this mixture is laid on, or
spread over the whole body, soon after the separation of the
sleece, or at the commencement of winter.  It is thought, that
this greatly contributes to preserve the animal from vermin;
to improve, and even increase the quantity of wool, and to 
secure it firmly to the body, so as to hinder any part of it from
falling off.  This fact having been controverted, some store-
masters have made an experiment of the effects, that would
be produced by omitting this operation; and, it is said, the
result was, that the animal was more infected with vermin,
more sickly and diseased, and, that the quantity of wool was
much less, than if smearing had taken place.  Whether this
is owing to the peculiar nature of the breed of sheep in these
hills, which are covered with sleeces, loose, open, and shak-
ing, and not thick, close, and matted, or whether smearing is
necessary with every sort of hill sheep, has not yet been fully
ascertained.  The large English breed of sheep have also been
tried on these hills, but unsuccessfully.  It was found, that
they grew lean, meagre, and pined away, and were neither
calculated for the climate, nor the pasture.

   Lower Part of the Parish.-The lower part of the parish is
all arable, and excellently cultivated.  The greater part of it
is inclosed with hedge and ditch, and a few places with stone
