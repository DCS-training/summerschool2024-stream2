mitted by the chancellor; or, in his absence, or during the

part of them, to the common utility of the college, and no

another office-bearer of a similar nature mentioned in the
foundation, and there stiled "bursarius communis," who is to
receive the bursaries in every faculty, and to render an ac-
count to the faculty of arts.  The appointment of this office-
bearer has been long discontinued, and his duty conjoined
with that of the common procurator.  The provisor, or
econonus, is appointed to be elected by the Principal, sub-

viz. the chancellor of Notre Dame and of Saint Genevieve*

By the same bull, it is appointed that those whom the rector
of the University, with the major part of the regents, mas-
ters or doctors of the respective faculties, shall recommend to
