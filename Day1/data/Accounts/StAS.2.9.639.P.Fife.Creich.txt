   From the session records, it appears that the family of Baillie
werein possession of Balmeadowside and Parbroath in 1668. They
subsequently purchased the estate of Luthrie, which at that time
comprehended the present lands of Luthrie, East Luthrie, and
Carphin. After having for some time retained possession of all these
different estates, they sold Parbroath to John, the second Earl of
Hopetoun, grandfather of George William Hope, Esq. M. P. the
present proprietor. In 1780, they sold Balmeadowside to D.
Wallace, Esq., and East Luthrie to Thomas Tod, Esq. The eldest
son of the former, and the only son of the latter, now inherit the
respective properties. Carphin was sold to Miss Halkerston of
Rathillet, great grand-aunt to C. B. Raitt, Esq. the present pro-
prietor.
   The late Colonel Alexander Baillie of Luthrie, who was pa-
tron of the parish, and Barrack-Master-General of Scotlaiid, died
without issue in 1814, and his widow, Mrs Euphan Hamilton or
Baillie, who was daughter and heiress of Mrs Bethia Hamilton of
Wishaw, continued in possession of the present estate of Luthrie
till the 17th September 1823, when she died. A handsome mar-
ble monument is erected to their memory in the new church. The
estate of Luthrie was, soon after the death of Mrs Baillie, sold to
Charles Hill, Esq. whose eldest son is now the proprietor.
   Land-owner, and the names of their properties in the parish,
