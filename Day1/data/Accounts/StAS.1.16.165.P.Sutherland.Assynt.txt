but perfectly diminutive when compared with those of the
height of Assint.  The numerous inhabitants here on their
small particular division of a town or farm, practice much
the same method with these on the height in rearing
cattle, which is the principal staple of the whole parish,
and the only one of the height of Assint.  But the inha-
bitants of Fan-Assint, or Lower Assint, have the additional
advantage of fishing in the surrounding offing, bays, seas,
and ocean, when they please, and when the weather will
permit them.  But of these bays, etc. in their proper place.
   The particular tract of the parish called Me-in-Assint,
i. e. the middle of Assint, is a perfect wild, covered with
heath, moss, heathery hills, and rocks of small size, and
fresh water lochs, which are numerous.  This tract con-
fists of the outskirts of all the farms on the whole coast of
the parish, and is used mostly in common, and as tem-
porary winterings, but not safe.

   Situation.-This parish is situated on the W. N. W.
coast of Scotland, within the county of Sutherland, the
presbytery of Dornoch, Synod of Sutherland and Caithness.
The synodical annual meeting is held alternately at Dornoch
and Thurso; the latter a town in the county of Caithness;
the former, the only Royal Burgh in that of Sutherland.
The distance betwixt Thurso and Dornoch is 43 computed
miles; thence to Assint 30 miles like measure, at least.
Three rivers, and several considerable rivulets, intersect the
road betwixt Assint and Dornoch; therefore, when the wea-
ther turns out rainy, and continues for but 24 hours, or
thereby, the very rivulets, and especially the rivers, are so
many tremendous torrents, not to be forded, and when
rashly attempted, the consequence seldom fails to prove
fatal; along these 30 miles, there is not one bridge, nor
but one or two small boats, of the shape or figure of salmon
