So late as 1832, in course of a draining process near the head
of a spring on Leetside, a well built round with hewn stone, was
laid bare considerably below the surface. It was little more than
three feet deep from the mouth. The oldest person living in
the parish knew nothing of its existence. It is banded down,
however, from the preceding generation, that a row of houses
occupied an elevated site close by the well. These houses went
by the name of Temple-Hall, in consequence, probably) of their
connection with some more ancient religious edifice. The spring too,
had all along been called The Temple-Well.*-Numerous querns,
as in dhfferent parts in Scotland, have been met with on the farm
of Laws.-It only remains to be here noticed, that till the middle
of last century, there was visible on the east of the present school-
house a kind of mound-the Birlie-Know or Justice-Court of
by-gone days. Thither the villagers usually repaired, to submit
their petty grievances, and ask redress; and there the Birliemen,
after hearing parties, pronounced their cheap and sapient deci-
sions.

                                                      1831,	664

   The increase, on the whole, can only be ascribed to the rapid
and extensive improvements in agriculture, since a large portion
of the land, which is now in a high state of cultivation, was for-
merly marshy or otherwise unproductive. The population, during
the current year 1833, is ascertained to be 636,-the deficiency, as
compared with 1831, being accounted for by the emigration of a
few families to Canada,-of which number, 220 reside in the
village of Whitsome, and 416 at the various farm home-steads.

<FOOTNOTE>The above designations may, however, owe their origin to the Knights Templar,
who are understood to have possessed about forty acres of the land of Myreside, now
a portion of the Blackadder estate; and, till recently, these acres bore the name of
"Temple-lands."
