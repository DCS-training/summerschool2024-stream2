   Agriculture.-The number of acres arable, may be esti-
mated at 1200.  Of these about 400 are allotted to oats,
200 for Chester bear, 30 for pease, about an equal number
for turnips, potatoes and cabbage; all the rest lie in grass.
about 144 acres being sown with red clover, white clover,
and rye-grass.  The number of ploughs is 28; but about 30
0r 40 years ago, the number was upwards of 40.  The cause
of the decrease is, that in many instances, two farms have
been joined into one since that period, and besides, in the hil-
ly part of the parishes, several farms which were formerly in
cultivation, are at present lying in grass, and meant to be kept
in that state, as pasture for cattle and sheep.  Twenty-eight
ploughts, indeed, are more than sufficient for all the ploughs
employed.  On a small farm of 18 or 20 acres, one plough
of four small horses is more than enough; so that the unit-
ing of small farms, which lie contiguous, may be sometimes
considered as a wise plan, and as tending to the advantage
of the country, at least in respect of the landlord.
   Within these last 30 years, the art of farming is greatly
improved in this place.  It is only about 20 years ago, that
the farmers began to clean their land by sowing turnip, and
to sow grass feeds.  Since that period there has been a great
spirit of industry and improvement.  As lime answers well
with their land, they have been in the practice for several
years of bringing it from a great distance.  Some of them
bring it at least 12 statute miles.  Hence the quantity of
grain produced at present is far greater than what was pre-
duced 30 years ago.  At present the parishes can spare an-
nually, at an average, about l500 bolls, part in oats and oat-
meal; but the greatest part, bear in grain, which is carried
to Brechin and Montrose.  The beginning of our seed-time
here is very various, owing to the spring snow lying long
near the bottom of the hills.  Generally we begin to sow oats
