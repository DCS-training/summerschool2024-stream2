be nearly stationary.  Indeed the improvement of 2 horses in-
stead of 4 in a plough, which was introduced in the year
1768, evidently lessened the number of farm servants; but
this effect of it seems to have been counteracted, by the addi-
tional work occasioned by the preferable modes of agriculture,
and particularly that of raising turnips, which commenced ex-
actly at the same period: for upon one large farm, on which
about 100 acres of turnips are raised annually, the numbers
are encreased, and more still could find employment.
   There are 7 heritors, 4 of whom reside: 10 farmers; 1 inn-
keeper: 3 weavers; 5 smiths; 4 carpenters; 4 taylors; 1
baker; 1 shoemaker; 1 dyer.  The other inhabitants are em-
ployed in the different operations of husbandry.

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-The high grounds, lying be-
tween Soutrahill and Lammerlaw, are adapted for the pasture
of the common Scotch sheep.  Attempts have been made to
raise crops of corn upon some parts of them, where the soil is
naturally good; but, though skill and industry have occasion-
ally succeeded, the expence, exposure, and climate, point out
the pasturing of them to be the most profitable system.-The
soil of the parish, in general, is various:  in some parts, a thin
wet clay; in others, mossy.  A great deal of it, however, is
fit for raising turnips or grain; and, wherever it is favourable
for these crops, it is cultivated generally with great attention
and ability.  The favourite rotation of crops is, turnips, bar-
ley or oats, clover, oats, which is certainly the best that is at
present in practice; though, were the climate earlier, an
improvement might be made upon it by introducing wheat
after turnips.  Several thousand bolls of oats, and some hun-
dred bolls of wheat and barley, are sent annually to mar-
ket.  Great attention has been given to the rearing of sheep,
and the success has been proportional.  It is from this parish
