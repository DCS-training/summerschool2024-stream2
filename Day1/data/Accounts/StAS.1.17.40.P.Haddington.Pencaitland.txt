come of 14 L.  The wages of an able workman at the lime-
kilns are 15 d. and, at piece work, he may earn 2 s. 6 d.
The colliers are paid by the quantity of coal they throw out,
and have a free house, together with coals for fuel.  A col-
lier, with a bearer, at the rate of working 4 or 5 days in the
week, earns 65 L. annually.  These great profits, as might be
expected, are, in general, thrown away in a very injudicious
manner, which tends not a little to produce a scarcity, and
to raise the price of coals at the pit.  It were, therefore, to
be wished, now that they have got their liberty, that some
measure could be taken, from which they might find it ne-
cessary to use it with more discretion.  This general stric-
ture applies by no means to the colliers on the estate of
Fountainhall, some of whom are decent in their morals, and
in affluent circumstances.  Perhaps the smallness of their
number preserves them, in some degree, from that dissipa-
tion which so generally characterises that class of people, and
on account of which alone, can they be deemed, by the pub-
lic, unworthy of their great earnings.

there are 1 lint, 1 starch, 1 thread, 4 barley, and 4 corn
mills.  There are several threshing mills, and one in particu-
lar built lately on the estate of Fountainhall, which is

operations above any other hitherto erected.  A consider-
able improvement is evidently obtained by these threshing
mills, when they are driven by water; but when horses must
be employed, it is not to be rated high.  In this district
there are many circumstances favourable to the introduction
and success of manufactures; but here, as in the Lothians in
general, this important national object meets with less atten-
tion than in other parts of Scotland, where difficulties, that
