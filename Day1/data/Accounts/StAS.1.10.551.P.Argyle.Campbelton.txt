     of Campbelton.

our markets here are pretty much regulated by the price of
provisions there.

   Wild Animals.-In this parish we have no wild animals,
birds, reptiles, or any species of vermin, but such as are
common throughout the west of Scotland.  The mole, for-
merly unknown, has lately made an inroad to the extent of
some miles within the isthmus.

   Minerals, Fuel, etc.-There is abundance of coal within
3 miles of Campbelton, and a canal lately made to convey it
to the town, where the small cart load (of which 3 should
make a ton) sells at 2 s. 7 1/2 d.  About 40 carts a-day are con-
sumed in the town.  Turf or peat is commonly used in the
country; as it is also by many of the poorer sort within the
town.  There is likewife, in this parish, abundance of Fuller's
earth, and soap rock, which, it is thought, may be manu-
factured into fine ware, or British china.

   Burgh.-CAMPBELTON, originally a small fishing village,
was erected into a royal burgh, in 1701.  It is governed by
a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild; counsellors, and a
treasurer.  This last employment is not very burdensome, as
the town has no landed property, and but a small revenue*.
We have, therefore, no great complaints of abuse, nor any
loud cry for reform.  Where the magistrates of burghs, like
the elders of churches, hold offices which occasion trouble,
and produce little emolument, perhaps, they rather deserve
the thanks of the public for what they do, than their cen-
sure for what they leave undone.

*Its principal funds arise from a tax of 1/44, or a lippie in
the boll, levied on all the meal and grain brought in from the
country; and from the tack profits of a miln, harbour dues,
and Church seats.
