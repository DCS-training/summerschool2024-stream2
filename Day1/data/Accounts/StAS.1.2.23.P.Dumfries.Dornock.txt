job.

   Rent, etc.-The parish is mostly let in small farms, from
L. 3:12s up to L. 120. per. annum, but the greater part of
them are about L. 30.  The best arable and meadow grounds,
late for about 20s. or a guinea per acre, that of an inferior qua-
lity, at an average, about is.  The valued rent of the whole
parish, is only 2620 merks Scots.  The land rent paid by
the tenants, is about L.1480 sterling; the fishing rents a-
bout L.220.; and house-rents, may be from L. 60. to L. 70 a
year:  total, about L.1760.  None of the greater proprietors,
who are 6 in number, reside in the parish.  There are 6 seuers
who have small portions of land of their own, who live in the
village of Dornock.  It is certainly unlucky for this district,
as well as for many others in Scotland, that the property of
the foil has fallen into the hands of great proprietprs, who draw
their rents annually away, and spend them either in London or
in foreign parts.  Whereas smaller proprietors, living and resid-
ing on the spot, would lay out their rents at home, and unit-
ing their stock and influence with men of activity in business,
in promoting manufactories, commerce, and improvements
of every kind, would soon prove of essential service both to
the district itself, and to the kingdom of general.

   Roads.-The great road from Carlisle to Portpatrick, runs
through the middle of the parish.  It was made at the expence of
goverment, but is kept in repair by money collected at a toll-
bar, lately erected upon it for that purpose.  Some of the cross-
roads in this parish were formerly made, and upheld by the
statue labour; but, in consequence of an act of parliament
obtained for that purpose, the statute labour is now com-
muted, and paid in money at the disposal of the commissioners
