     Parish of Oathlaw.

     Rev. Tho.  Barker.

   To satisfy you concerning the number of our paupers-
that we have no more than two receiving charity, is a certain
fact, both old women, and widows; and what is still more,
one of them does not properly belong to us, but to a neigh-
bouring parish, and came to reside with a daughter married
to a labouring man here.  A few years ago, I hinted to Mr.
Howlett a reason why we have so few paupers here, viz.  We
have neither brewers, nor beggars, nor bastards, nor bank-
rupts; but a sober, frugal and laborious people; no idlers
nor drunkards; every family brew their own beer; no sec-
taries.  We have indeed a family or two with a number of
young children that we occasionally relieve with small sums;
and it is sometimes with difficulty that they will be prevailed
upon to accept of them, but no longer than they can do for
themselves, which is often at a very early age.

     Parish of Meigle.

     Rev. James Playfair.

   There is one mistake I committed in my account of the
parish of Meigle, and which, for an obvious reason, I am
desirous of having corrected.  Lumphanan is said to lie in
the Mearns, whereas it is in Aberdeenshire.  Two typogra-
phical errors, in line 22 and 28 of page 514, are not to be
attributed to me; and every reader will at once perceive that
tenant and creation are the words of the author.
