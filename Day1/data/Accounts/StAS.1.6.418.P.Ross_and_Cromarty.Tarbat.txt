dately above the harbour, the land rises to a considerable
height, extends eastward into the sea 3 miles in length, and
is not more than half a mile in breadth at the neck which joins
the head-land to the body of the parish.-From these local
circumstances the parish has its name.-Tarbat, being a Gae-
lic word, expressive of the peninsular situation of the place,
and its having the appearance, when viewed at a distance, of
a body stretched out in the sea and nearly surrounded by it,
Tar signifying a Belly or Prominence, and Bait, drowned or
immersed in water.-The parish is in length 7 1/2 miles; in
breadth it does not in any part exceed 4 1/2 miles; in circumfe-
rence it is 19 1/4 miles, and of that measurement 15 miles belong
to the sea coast.

   Surface, Soil, etc.-There are no high mountains or high
hills in the parish.  Geanies has the most elevated situation of
any place belonging to it.  There, a rocky precipice to the S. rises
more than 20 feet above the level of the sea, the fields on
the N. and N. W. descend with a considerable declivity, a de-
gree of which continues all the way to the north shore, though
in most parts so gradual as to be scarce perceptible.  There are
in some other parts, a few rising grounds, which have a simi-
lar effect, but, in general, the fields are nearly level, or have
no inequality but what is rather useful than otherwise.-There
is a variety of soil; some of a loamy quality; some light, with
a mixture of sand, or lying upon it; and a part of it, deep,
with a bottom of hard gravel.  There are no lakes or rivers in
the parish, but there are a number of small lochs or natural
ponds, which become dry in summer; and fresh water springs
are to be found in every corner, particularly in parts near the
sea.  One of them at Portmaholmack is remarkable for the light-
ness of its water.  At a short distance is another, within flood-
mark, which discharges the salt water at ebb, and becomes
