   The people are social among themselves, and seem
contented; and their curcumstances may be guessed from
the punctuality of paying their rents, which, except
in a very few instances, they do as exactly, or perhaps
more so, than any parish in the mainland.

   Hints fo Improvement, and Miscellaneous Observa-
tions.-The only method I can see how their circum-
stances can be meliorated is, by a change of climate, in-
