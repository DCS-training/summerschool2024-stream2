   Village.-The village of BOWMORE was begun in the year
1768, and laid out on a regular plan.  By order of the pro-

There are already 110 houses built in the village, 50 of which
are covered with blue slates, 20 with tiles, and the rest are
thatched.  The inhabitants are increasing.  The number at
present (1793), of old and young, is about 500.
