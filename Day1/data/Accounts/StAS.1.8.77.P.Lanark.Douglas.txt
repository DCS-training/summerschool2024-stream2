   Situation, Extent, Soil and Climate.-The extent of the
parish is considerable, being about 12 miles long, and in some
places from 4 to 6, in others from 6 to 7 broad.  The parish
is situated, about 40 miles from the sea, every way.  The soil
is variable, except the holms, which being a new soil formed
by the river, is pretty uniform; but the ground on either
side is very spouty, occasioned in some places by the outburst,
of the coal and other minerals; but in most places by the
bottom being a cold wet till.  The lands are mostly laid out
in sheep farms.  In the strath, and along the banks of the
river, there are several arable farms; but the lands occupied
in this manner, bear small proportion, to what are laid out in
sheep walks.  Their pasture is hilly, though not very high;
and is both green and heathy.  The air is very moist, particu-
larly in spring and autumn.  The winds generally blow im-
petuously about the time of the equinox; and frequently in
autumn shake a deal of corn.  They blow mostly from the
S. W., which being the direction of the river, and the banks
high on each side, what would be accounted a moderate breeze
in other places, is here often a kind of hurricane.  It is how-
ever a very healthy place; and there are in it many instances
of longevity.  Many have exceeded 80 and 90 during the
incumbency of the present minister.  There are 2 men in the
parish at present aged 92; and it is well authenticated, that a
man died here, in the beginning of this century, aged at least
110, having lived during a part of 3 centuries.

   Woods and Rivers.-There is very little natural wood in
this parish, and that only a kind of brush.  The ash appears
to have been the favourite tree of our ancestors.  At many
of the old farm steads, there are large ash trees; and at the
Castle of Douglas there is a row of very aged ones, which,
tradition says, were used in barbarous times for hanging their
