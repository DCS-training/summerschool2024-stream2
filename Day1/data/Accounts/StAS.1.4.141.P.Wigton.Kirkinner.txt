all information that can be obtained, the annual average
appears not to exceed 14; so that we are manifestly a nur-
sery, as I suppose all other country parishes are, for cities
and great towns, whose industry hath hitherto been so
much cherished, even at the expence, sometimes, of our
radical and more valuable industry on the soil, and the
first care of its productions, so little understood or valued
by the luxurious citizens who live by them.  But a wiser
policy begins now, I think, to take place, or at least to
be meditated.  Marriages, in 11 years, have been 77.
But frequently one only of the parties has resided in the
parish.  There is one woman at present alive in this pa-
rish, said to be several years above 100, and another known
to be 98.  The number of farmers, who rent lands in til-
lage, is about 50.  There are, besides these, a considerable
number who pay rent for small spots of land, either imme-
diately to the proprietors, or by subtacks to principal te-
nants, but who depend upon their industry as day-labou-
rers, or as handicraftsmen, for their subsistence.  The fa-
milies of this class are about 20.  About 2000 acres of our
best land, is in pasture.  Each considerable farmer, besides
servants who live in his house, has generally a married ser-
vant, to whom he gives a house, a small garden, and a cow's
grass, with straw for her fodder in the winter, and allows
him to plant, in ground prepared and dunged for his own
use, 3 or 4 bushels of potatoes; and besides other indul-
gencies, L. 4 or L. 5 in money.  The money wages, and
other articles allowed to such a servant annually, may be
estimated between L. 12 and L. 14.
   The number of families is 238.  Upwards of 30 of these
have come into the parish within these 12 years last past,
owing to the division of one large farm itno 13 or 14 smal-
ler possessions, and to several subtacks on another farm,
which had long lain in pasture; also to several small leases
