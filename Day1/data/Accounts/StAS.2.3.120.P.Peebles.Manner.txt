amounts to L. 113, 3s. 1 1/2d. of money; 23 bolls, 2 firlots, 2 pecks,

1/2 lippie of barley, and the same quantity of meal.
   The number of families attending the Established church is 3o;
of persons of all ages attending that church, 120;* of persons of
all ages attending the chapels of Dissenters and Seceders, 38; of
Episcopalians, 7; of Roman Catholics, 2.
   Considering the very inconvenient situation of the Established
church, Divine service there is very well attended.
   The average number of communicants at the Established church
is 65.
   Education.-The parochial teacher has L. 30 of salary, and
L. 14 arising from school fees, together with the legal accommo-
dations.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
receiving Parochial aid is 4; the average stim allotted to each per
week, 3s.; the annual amount of contributions for the relief of the
poor, L. 15. Of this sum, about L. 8, 10s. are collected in the
church; L. 3 arise from occasional contributions, and the remain-
der is supplied by the interest of L. 184, which is the amount of
our existing poors' fund.
   Inns, Alehouses, &c.-There is not a single inn or alehouse in
the parish.
   Coal is the kind of fuel principally used in this parish. It is
generally procured either from White-hill, in Mid-Lothian, or
from Wilsonton, in the upper ward of Lanarkshire. When brought
here it costs about 1s. per cwt.-two-thirds of the expense being
occasioned by the carriage. Though there is abundance of peat,
of good quality, in various parts of the parish, very little of it is
used by the inhabitants for fuel.

<FOOTNOTE>It deserves to be mentioned, that beside these there are some who frequently
attend the Established church, but who communicate with the Dissenters or Seceders.
