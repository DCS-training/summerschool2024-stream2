which the decline of these works*, once so flourishing, is
ascribed, is a violent from which happened the very night
on which King James died, by which the moat, and different
parts of the machinery, were either greatly damaged, or to-
tally destroyed.  From this shock, though they were after-
wards wrought partially they never entirely recovered, and
were, for a time, wholly deserted.  At present there is a
temporary supply of coal procured from the croppings of the
old works, and gleanings accidentally left.  It is certain,
however, that very rich seams of coal yet remain, espe-

Preston, under lease to the Earl of Dundonald, which, on
account of the great depth at which they lie, cannot be
wrought to any purpose without the expenditure of a consi-
derable sum of money; yet, situated as they are, close to the
shore, and so commodiously for exportation, this obstacles,
we are in hopes, will be soon removed.

where his Majesty was entertained still retains the name of the
King's room.

Pennyless Pilgrimage.
