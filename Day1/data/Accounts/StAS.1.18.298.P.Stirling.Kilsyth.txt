     Statistical Account

each army can be distinctly traced.  Such as the Bullet and
Baggage-know, the Drum-burn, the Slaughter-how or hollow,
Kill e-many butts, etc. etc.  In the Bullet know and neighbour-

To this day, numberless scenes of blood and cruelty are re-
corded.  One in particular is mentioned.  A poor country
man having fled with his four sons, was overtaken by a flying
party.  Being suspected by them, they instantly fell upon the
old man, though feeble and unarmed.  The generous youths
