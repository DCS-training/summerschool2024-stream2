the air soon becomes foul and nauseous: hence often
shades are, in some cases, preferable to close stalls; and
the larger the stalls, the purer will be the air, and the cat-

our situation invites to these improvements, as the neigh-
bourhood abounds in excellent materials, especially the
hills of Turin and Pitscandbe (this last is a continuation

stores of stone of various kinds, and of every dimension fit

Gentlemen of this cast would sometimes deign to come

the E. end of the parish, on the estate of Balmadies, there
is a chapel-yard or burying-ground, in which it would
