     General Appendix to

cut a canal one mile in length from thence to the river above
Craigannet, at a place called the Baad.  This cut will shorten
the navigation two miles and a half, and will avoid the most
perplexed parts of the river; but will be expensive, as the
cutting must be deep, and the ground is valuable.  I have
stated the expence of this work in the estimates preferable to
the other.  It being proper, until accurate surveys are made,
to reckon upon the greatest expence.
   If this cut be made, a dam must be erected at Craigannet,
near the upper end of Craigforth rock, where the river has
a rocky bottom, and stones lye at hand.  The height of the
dam may be four feet, which will raise the surface of the up-
per Forth to twelve feet above neap tides high water, will
supersede all dredging below the Frew ford, and probably will
give a sufficiency of water in the Goodie to near the Thorn-
hill mill.
   Another dam of five feet fall may be erected at the Frew,
which, without dredging, will navigate the river to Cardross,
and will give dead water near to the top of the ford there.
   A third lock and dam of five feet fall, erected at Cardross,
will give a sufficiency of water near to the bridge of Gart-
more; and whenever there is a fresh in the river, boats will
easily pass the stream into the dead water above the bridge.
   If the cut from Kildcan to Baad is laid aside, Craigfourth
dam must be made good, and a lock erected there of eight
feet fall.  The lock formerly proposed at the Frew may be
placed below the mouth of the Goodie, where it wilt save al-
most all the dredging in the Forth, and will raise a sufficiency
of water in the Goodie.  The lock at Cardross must be pla-
ced below the ford, and must be of eight feet fall at least.
   The Forth and Goodie being navigated by one or other of
these methods, the next point would be to connect it with
the Devon.  The best means of effecting this, I have shewn
