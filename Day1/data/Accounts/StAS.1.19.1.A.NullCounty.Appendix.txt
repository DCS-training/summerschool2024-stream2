Communication by Alexander Carnegie, Esq; Town-Clerck of
Aberdeen, regarding the Statistical Circumstance of that
City.  See No.  IV.

   THE city of Aberdeen, is one of the most ancient, and
is endowed with some of the greatest privileges and
immunities, of any of the royal boroughs in Scotland.
   All historical accounts agree, that it was originally erect-
ed into a royal burgh, towards the end of the ninth century,
by King Gregory of Scotland, sirnamed the Great.
   But the original charter of erection, and all the more an-
cient title-deeds and records of the burgh, were, along with
the town itself, burnt and destroyed by the English, as
after noticed.
   A very few charters and other grants, however, have
been saved; the oldest of which is a charter by King Wil-
liam the Lyon, in favour of the burgesses of Aberdeen and
others be-north the Month, granted at Perth, but without
any date or year, though it must have been towards the
end of the twelfth century, as that King only began to reign
in 1165.
   There are other two charters granted by the same King
William, to the burgesses of Aberdeen, of the toll of their
chattles through the whole kingdom; both of them dated
at Aberdeen, the 28th of August, without mentioning
either the year of God or King's reign, although, from the
writing and seals, they appear to be of a later date than the
     V0L. XIX. a
