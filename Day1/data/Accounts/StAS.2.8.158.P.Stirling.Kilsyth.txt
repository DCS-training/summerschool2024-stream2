   The above is calculated rather under the real value.
   Much has been done by the proprietors of the chief estate, in
the way of improvement, since the time of last Account. The pa-
rish was then comparatively a desert. There were no trees, with
the excepthon of a few about Colzium and Townhead. Now, there
are many beautiful belts of planting. The fields are all neatly
subdivided into commodious parks, surrounded with hawthorn
hedges.
   In the year 1803, the proprietor of the Kilsytb estate laid out
a very large sum in improvements, farm-houses. &c. The build-
ings were, in several instances, by far too large and expensive, for
the size and value of the farm, so that a great part of the enor-
mous outlay never has, and never will be, returned. The farm of
Gaval alone, in the West Barony, had dwelling-house and stead-
ings erected at an expense of L. 4,500. It was then designated
Kilsyth Farm, now Gaval House, where the factor resides. Many
of the houses now stand in need of considerable repairs.
   Liberal encouragement is given to the tenants, in the way of
improvements. A tile and brick-work, upon the estate at Curry-
mire, in the East Barony, furnishes the means of drain-making.
The tiles are allowed, at a small cost, to the tenants,--besides al-
lowance for liming, when the soil requires it.

                   V.-PAROCHIAL Economy.
   This parish may be said to comprise three of a moderate size
and population, viz. the town and suburbs, containing 2900;
the East Barony and moorlands, nearly 1000; and the West Ba-
rony, about 350. The Railway work is said to have added nearly
500; but these are again departing. The census about to be taken
will probably show the population to be still about 4300.
   The town lies on the most northerly road from Edinburgh to

This, however, must have been a mistake, as at no period could this parish have fur-
nished the means of feeding to that extent; especially at a time when turnip was
scarcely known.
