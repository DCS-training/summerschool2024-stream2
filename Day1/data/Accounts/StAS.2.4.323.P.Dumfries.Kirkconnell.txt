Whitecleuch, parish of Crawfordjohn, which adjoins the parish of
Kirkconnel. The road to that limework, at present, is not in good
repair; but in the course of a few years, it is expected that that
district of the parish will be completely opened up with excellent
roads, sufficient to convey the mail-coach and carriages of every
description from Portpatrick to Edinburgh and Glasgow, by con-
necting it with a new line of road already made in Galloway. From
the survey and measurement taken, it is said, that the above line
will shorten the distance about thirty miles.

   October 1835.
