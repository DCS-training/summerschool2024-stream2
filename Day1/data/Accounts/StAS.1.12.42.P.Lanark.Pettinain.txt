this kind of trees in particular.-The fuel generally used in 
the parish is coal, and a few peats, which are brought from 
the other side of the river.  The coal is mostly brought from 
Ponseigh, which is near 7 miles distant from the village.  
The roads have been greatly mended within the last 20 years; 
but the materials are generally soft, which renders frequent 
repairs necessary.  Some of the cross roads are very bad.
The statute-labour is converted into money, and amounts to 
about 12 L. a-year.  This sum, judiciously laid out, will soon

people, upon the whole, may be said to live comfortably in 
their situation.  They are industrious and sober, and, in ge-

There has only been one or two seceders in the parish for ma-

person belonging to the parish has been prosecuted for any 
capital crime, within the memory of the oldest inhabitant,
