            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   The portion of Renfrewshire to which our attention is now to
be directed, was, previous to the year 1736, all in-eluded in one
parish, known by the name of the parish of Paisley.  The town
of Paisley is the only part of it, which, by a deed of the Court of
Teinds, has been erected into distinct parishes.  Its magistrates,
however, are still regarded as heritors in the original parish and,
as such, pay a proportion of the stipend, and retain a certain num-
ber of sittings in the church.  Since the act of the General As-
sembly, by which Chapels of Ease were raised to the status of pa-
rish churches, Johnstone, in the western district, has been so ele-
vated, and the church at Levern, in ihe south-eastern district, is
about to have a parish assigned to it.  Meantime, it will be con-
venient to consider the whole as forming one parish, especially
as the town of Paisley occupies but a small extent of surface,
and is completely surrounded, by what is now, by way of distinc-
tion, called the Abbey parish.
   Etymology.-We are indebted for the following ingenious ob-
servations on the etymology of the word Paisley, as well as on
that of various places situated in the parish, to William Kerr, Esq.
surgeon, Paisley.

    A separate parish is not assigned to the minister of the Gaelic Church.
