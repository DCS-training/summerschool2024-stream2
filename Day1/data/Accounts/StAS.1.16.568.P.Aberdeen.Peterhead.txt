     Statistical Account

ment at first, and many years afterwards, was very parti-
cular; a person was engaged at the rate of 10 s. to mow
and cure an acre of grass.  There was a great deal of work
employed in this operation; it required four days to mow
the grass; it was permitted to lie in the swarth several
days, afterwards carefully exposed to the sun for a conside-
rable time, and then put into small cocks; there were turn-
ed over regularly every other fair day, to bask in the sun,
several weeks passed before it was thought out of danger,
and then put into a rick, or carried to the corn-yard.
This practice continued till Dr Anderson's method of cu-
ring hay was published; since that time there are many
instances of large fields of hay being entirely out of danger
in the course of eight days, after beginning to mow the
grass, without any exposure to the sun, excepting what is
unavoidable in reducing the number of cocks.  I wish I
could say the practice was universal.  There are many in-
stances which might be mentioned of good farming in this
parish, both by the proprietors and farmers, at some parti-
cular times; and in many places the land is in a very high
slate of cultivation.  At present 1 see no steady plan of
good husbandry, and in particular no proper rotation of
crops; there is not an acre of wheat nor of lint in the pa-
rish; very little fallow, and very little expence bestowed
on liming or dunging, though both lime and dung may be
had in sufficient quantity, and on moderate terms, com-
pared with those in other places.
   Thirty years ago persons were hired to carry the dung
of the town of Peterhead to the sea; it was considered as a
nuisance, and might have been obtained by any farmer
without paying any price for it; it has for many years
been purchased at a pretty high price, and some of it car-
ried into neighbouring parishes; but still there is a great
deal neglected, and cast into the sea.
