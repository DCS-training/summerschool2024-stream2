valuable, but rather unpleasant to labour, being banky in
some places.  The skirts of the parish on the west and south
are moorish.  A great part of that tract of land which lies
between the rivers, especially about the village, is so stony,
that tradition reports it to have been once all covered with
houses.  In very few places, however, have the stones any
appearance of having ever been used in building.  The
grounds on the east end of the parish, and those on the south
side of the Teviot, are inclosed with ditch and hedge.  The
fences, being in general grown up, and ornamented with
hedge-rows of trees; besides, various woods, and little
thickets, or clumps of wood, reared upon unarable knolls
and rocky hillocks in several parts, make the country look
rich and beautiful.  The parish is bounded by Maxton,
Ancrum, and Crailing, on the west; by Crailing and Eck-
ford, on the south; by Kelfo, on the east; by a part of
Kelfo and Makerston, on the north.

lying in pasture or in tillage, the fields every where around
display the remarkable activity, agricultural spirit, and skill
of the farmers.  Equal in all kinds of husbandry within their
sphere to any in the kingdom, the landholders and farmers here
are particularly attentive to the cultivation of potatoes, and,
being favoured by the nature of the soil, have carried it
to a very high degree of perfection.  Three hundred fir-
lots per acre is a frequent produce.  They are planted in
drills, the distance between each plant sometimes about
three feet, and are completely cleaned of weeds by frequent
hoeing; the first and second time very deep, with a sharp
pointed hoe, afterwards not so deep, left the root should be
injured.  About the time of their blooming, the earth is laid
