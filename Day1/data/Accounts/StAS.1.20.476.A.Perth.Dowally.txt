courages him to apply all his skill and capital to the culti-
vation of his farm, from the confidence it gives him, that he
will have an opportunity of enjoying the fruits of their ap-
plication.  In consequence of the last rule particularly, he
has the produce of his white crops materially increased, and
what he never had before the command of, winter and
spring provender for his cattle.
   The rotation of crops which theory might shew would be
the most perfectly suited to the soil, cannot be reduced to
practice from the smallness of the farms.  But the best law
of rotation has been given them which they are able to
bear.  It is stipulated as the leading regulation, that one-
fifth part of each farm shall be always in clover and rye-
grass, and another in summer fallow, or some green crop.
The rest of the ground is left to white crops and flax.
   The tenants were themselves astonished at the striking
effect of the alteration in their mode of culture, and they
became zealous to prosecute the advantages presented by
their leases.  Stones, brushwood, wet, and waste spots,
which had existed for ages, to the reproach of the farmer,
and the loss of the public, began to disappear; and it is not

pletely swept from the face of the country.  A greater
stretch of improvement has taken place during the last 15
years, than during a century preceding.

   The light sandy soil of the haughs bears plentiful crops of
turnip.  Potatoes yield in general 30 bolls per acre, and
oats, which yielded formerly not more than 4 bolls, yield
now 8.  Barley may be estimated at nearly the same rate
of produce.  From a peck of flax-seed sown, there are, on
an average, 3 stones (Dutch weight) of dressed flax.  Each
tenant of ??? ploughgate sows 8 pecks of flax-seed yearly.
They begin now to keep their own seed for sowing, and
