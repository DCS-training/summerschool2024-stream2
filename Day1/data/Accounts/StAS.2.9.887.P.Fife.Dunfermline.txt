     These worsted warps, and especially linen full harness looms,
are now (1843) greatly increased. Of the 3517 looms, 570 were
out of the parish ; for the trade supports looms in the adjoining
parishes of Torryburn, Carnock, Culross, and Inverkeitbing, and
even as far as at Kinross, Auchtermuebty, Leslie, and Strathmi-
glo.
     The following is a table of the number of looms, in and out of
the parish of Dunfermline, and of the value of goods manufactur-
ed, at various periods, as nearly as can be ascertained, which I
bave compiled from different sources, showing at one view the
gradual progress of the trade.
