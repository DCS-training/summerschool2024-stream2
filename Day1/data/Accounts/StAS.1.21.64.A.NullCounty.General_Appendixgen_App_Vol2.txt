fioth?  Or, shall we continue the present unjust plan, by
which our real poor are half starved?  I pretend not to be
possessed of legislative powers; but I am sure I could con-
trive a plan for the support of the poor in this parish, by
which our present evils would be corrected.  And first, I
would propose that a tax should be laid upon sectarists equi-
valent to what people in the same circumstances and who at-
tend the established church, voluntarily give every sabbath at
the church door.  This is no more than justice; and as the
offering we receive every Lord's day from each individual
who attends the established church is commonly a halfpenny,
the tax laid upon each individual sectarists should be the same.
From the number of sectarists in this parish, this tax which
cannot be called either oppressive or unjust, would encrease
our funds about L. 10 sterling per annum.  The greatest evil
which this country labours under from the sectarists, arises
from the diminution which their separation occasions in our
collections for the poor on sabbath, and considering the way
in which the contributions in their different houses are em-
ployed, it is an evil which a wife and an attentive legislature
would correct.
   To the above tax upon sectarists, the landholders should
likewise be obliged to contribute their mite according to their
respective possessions in the parish; as they never reside
among us, we never see their faces on sabbath, and are con-
sequently deprived of their collections at the church door.
But as they in particular are called upon by the laws of Chris-
tianity, to support the poor, they should be obliged to send
us annually what their collections on sabbath would come to,
if they were residing in the parish and attending the church.
Were this plan established in the country parishes in Scot-
land it would be attended with the happiest effects.  The
real poor would be much better supported than they are at
