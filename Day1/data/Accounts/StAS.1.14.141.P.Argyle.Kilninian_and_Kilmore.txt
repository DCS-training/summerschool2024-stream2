carts, or even sledges, are used.  Some gentlemen have
begun to use the two-horse plough, but hitherto rarely
without a goad's man.  The common crop is a very in-
ferior kind of oats, which the inhabitants call small oats.
They begin sowing them about the 20th of March; and it
is the beginning of October, and sometimes later, before
they are ripe.  The common return is 3 seeds; of which
2 bolls go to make one of meal.  Barley is sown about the
end of April, and is ripe about the middle or end of Au-
gust.  It returns from 6 to 10 seeds; and when sown in,
old ground, manured with sea-ware, and laboured with
the spade, it produces sometimes 16 fold.  Potatoes are,
for the most part, planted in beds by the spade, and make
the chief subsistence of the poorer sort, for 3 quarters, or
10 months of the year.  The returns are various, accord-
ing to the manure and labour expanded on them; but
that they are far short of the returns from this root, in
other parts of Scotland, is evident from this circumstance,
that some families, in this country, find it necessary to
plant from 30 to 40 barrels of them yearly, for their
own consumption.  Till the late act, obliging distillers
of spirits to take out a license, the manufacturing of
barley into whisky, was by much too common a prac-
tice in this country; but the number of stills have, since
that period, been greatly diminished, much to the advan-
tage of the country, and, it is thought, without any loss
to the revenue.

   Climate, &c.-The climate of this island is very rainy;
and, according to the general persuasion, it has become
much more so of late years, than formerly.  Severe gales
of wind, from the W. and N. W. are frequent.  Our
winters are, for the most part, much more temperate and
