under pretence of begging, and save many from an un-
timely end.  No one would grudge the real indigent their
supply; but so many impositions and thefts are intole-
rable in a land that has any regulation.  In 1783, this
parish received 13 1/2 bolls of the government meal.

   Mortification in favour of the Minister.-There is a mor-
tification in behalf of the minister, of 10 L. Sterling, which
lies in his hands, free of interest, and is transferred to the
successor at entry.  This is said to be made by one of the
Earls of Buchan, who had property in this parish, in tes-
timony of the minister's hospitality, which had much
pleased him, upon honouring him with a visit.

   Mortification in favour of the Schoolmaster.-The Reve-
rend Mr. George Bruce, minister of Dunbar, has, within
these two years, mortified 100 L. Sterling in behalf of the
schoolmaster, through an attachment to the parish, he
himself having taught the school here in his younger days.
He has required the schoolmaster to be established, and to
be put in possession of at least 100 merks of salary; and
the heritors, to concur with him, have made it 200 merks.
He requires, as a condition of tenure, that the schoolmas-
ter shall read portions of scripture to the congregation,
betwixt the second and third bells.  In case of neglect,
the mortification to be transferred to Rothiemay, Mr.
Bruce's native parish.  Lord Banff, as patron, and Colonel
Duff, as next greatest heritor, and the minister, and their
successors, are appointed trustees for the management.
And the reverend presbytery of Turriff are requested by
the donor to inspect the application, with power to ques-
tion any abuse; and a copy of the deed of mortification is
inserted in their records.
