     of Kilninver and Kilmelfort.

80 feet over, and admits vessels of only between 10 and 20
tons burden, as it is dry and passable at low water, in some
parts, both for men and horses It runs smooth and straight,
with a strong current, and forms a beautiful canal.  Former-
ly there was a ferry boat here, but lately there has been a
bridge built over it, consisting of a single arch, 72 feet wide,
and 27 feet above the highest water mark.  At both ends
of the sound there is good and safe anchorage; the whole
forming a most delightful and picturesque scenery.
   Lochmelfort gives a sea coast of six miles, and makes a
beautiful and safe roadstead.  Herrings frequent this loch
and the west end of the sound of Clachansoail, and some-
times Lochfeachin, but they have been taken in greater quan-
tity at Lochmelfort, where of late years a good deal have
been caught.  A good haddock bank has lately been disco-
vered in this loch; and the coast upon the sound of Mull
abounds plentifully with sea-fish in great variety.  These
shores furnish also most kinds of shell fish, lobsters, crabs,
oysters, spout-fish, hose-fish, cockles, and muscles.

   Rivers and Lakes.-These are the river Euchar, running
through the middle of the parish of Kilninver from the E. to
the N. W. and having its source in a lake of a mile and 2
half long and near a mile broad, called Lochseammadale.
Into this lake or loch the water of Braegleon, and a number
of rivulets descending from the neighbouring hills, discharge
themselves.  From this lake the river Euchar runs for 4
miles N W. receiving in its course several tributary streams
and rivulets, till it empties itself, at the embouchure of Loch-
feachin, into the Sound of Mull.  At this place there is a
good salmon fishing, besides many others upon that loch.
The river Oude, which takes its rise also from a lake in the
braes of Lorn, called Lochtralig, of a mile long and about
