			COUNTY OF WIGTON.                    229

of England. Nor is the smallness of the sum applied to their
relief less remarkable than the paucity of the number of paupers.
The aggregate annual amount distributed among these 700 poor
is only about L.1375, being rather less than L.2 for each indivi-
dual, or at the extraordinarily low rate of 6d. per head of popula-
tion. The lowness of this rate will be best appreciated when we
state that the average burden in England, previously to the new
poor law in 1834, was twenty-three times greater, or 11s. and 8d.
per head of population. There are no poor-rates or legal assess-
ments in the whole county except in one parish.
	Wigton, Whithorn, and Stranraer unite with the small burgh of
New Galloway in returning a Member to Parliament. The constitu-
ency of the first is 101; of the second 54; of the third 217; and New
Galloway 20; the aggregate being 392. John M'Taggart of
Ardwell, Esq. is the present member. Constituency of the county
942,--represented by James Blair of Penninghame, Esq.
