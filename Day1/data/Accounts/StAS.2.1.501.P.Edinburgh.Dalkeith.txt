liers of a very superior description have been recently erected
at Whitehill and Thorny bank, and impart an air of elegance and
comfort to the neighbourhood. The brickfield at the north-east-
ern extremity of the parish was begun to be wrought in 1837: it
yields an ample supply of bricks and tiles, which are formed with
astonishing rapidity by a very ingenious machine, contrived by the
present Marquis of Tweeddale.
   Parochial Registers.-The first register is a small quarto, very
imperfect; it contains baptisms and marriages from 1612 to
1617. There is a small square volume, beginning with the fol-
lowing title: "Compt of the mortcloth made 8th August 1632-
1639;" it contains also various mortifications and dispositions.
The next contains a register of baptisms, from 1639 to 1651;-
marriages, from 1639 to 1652;-and minutes, from 1641 to 1653.
Some leaves are wanting at the beginning of the minutes. The
first minute is dated the 4th July 1641, and the last is dated
19th June 1653. There is a gap in the series from 1653 to
1659.-There is a minute-book, and treasurer's accounts, from 1674
to 1681; it is in a most imperfect state, many leaves being wanting
both at the beginning, in the course of the book, and at the end.-
Minute-book from 1659 to 1680, commencing Tuesday, December
28th. A compt and reckoning book from 1687 to 1690. There is
another gap in the series of minutes from 1680 to February 8th 1691.
There is a register of things acted, from February 1691 to 14th
November 1701. Register from 14th November 1701 to 22d
May 1709. Register of acts, &c. from 17th February 1723 to
3d December 1766. In page 64 of the minute-book for 1693,
there is a list of session books.-The records from the commence-
ment of the eighteenth century to the present time are complete,
and, with some exceptions, well kept. The register of deaths and
burials seems for some years to have been altogether neglected.
Several of the volumes are in very bad order; the edges are much
worn, and many leaves are loose; in short, the whole series would
require to be carefully inspected, repaired, and rebound,-and
lodged where they would be preserved from damp and rough
usage.
   Antiquities.-The principal object in the parish entitled to no-
tice under the head of antiquities is the ancient choir attached to the
parish church. It is 44 feet long by 27 feet wide, and is built in
a more ornamental style than the body of the church. It contains
within its area the statues of the Earl of Morton and his lady re-
