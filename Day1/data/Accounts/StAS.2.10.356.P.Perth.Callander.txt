  of this place.  A market is still held here, annually, in the
  month of March, which goes by the name of Feill-ma-Ches-
  saig, i. e. the festival of St Kessaig. There is a similar tu-
  mulus, about half a mile west, at a place called Little Leney,
  where was a chapel of old, and which is still used as a burying-
  place.  There is only one turnpike road in the parish leading
  from Callander to the West Highlands. The other roads in the
  parish are kept in repair, by money raised from the tenants, who
  are assessed according to their rents and the extent of their farms,
  and also from such others as are able to pay.  The money thus col-
  lected is laid out by commissioners in repairing roads and bridges.
  There is a new line of road in progress from Kippen to Callan-
  der by Thornhill, which, when completed, will be of essential bene-
  fit to this place, as it will open up to us a direct communication
  with the farmers in the Frews, who have been in the habit of
  supplying this place with hay, &c.

  which he has erected a splendid and commodious mansion-house,
  and is now engaged in laying out the grounds, in improving the
  soil, and in beautifying the place, which lies along the north banks
  of the Teath.  Both the English find Gaelic languages are spoken
  in the parish, and divine worship on Sabbath is performed in both.

  Gaelic.  The Highland dress is not so generally worn as it was
  forty years ago.
      The people are in general, well-informed, intelligent, sober in
  their habits, kind and affectionate in their dispositions, and upon
  the whole, moral, religious, and well disposed.
