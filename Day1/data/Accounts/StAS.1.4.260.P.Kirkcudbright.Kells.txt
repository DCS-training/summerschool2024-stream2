hills on the N. W. covered with grass; a great number of
lesser rocky  hills in the intetior part of it, interspersed with
large flats of moss, all covered with heath; here and there
is a large spot of meadow and arable land.  The soil on the
S. W. and N. is shallow, rocky, and barren, fit only for
sheep-walks.  Along the burns and rivulets, are spots of
meadow and arable land.  On the east side, along the Ken,
and for a mile, and sometimes more, on both sides of it,
the land is mostly arable, and is either flat or sloping to-
wards the river.  The flats are of a deep rich clay; the
sloping and higher land, of a thin, dry, and kindly soil,
and improved with dung, the only manure the country
affords, yields good crops.  Some of it of late has been
improved with lime and marl, and fully repaid the expence.
The flat land at the head of Loch Ken, consisting of 200
acres, is perhaps one of the richest spots in Scotland.  It is
of a deep clayith soil, enriched by the overflowing of Loch
Ken, which covers it severals times during winter and spring,
and, like the Nile, leaves behind it the salts, oils, and fat
earths, carried down by the Ken; so that many acres pro-
duce 300 stone of natural hay, and the arable is fertile in
proportion.  Some of it has been cropped 25 times succes-
sively, without any manure, but what it recieves from the
inundation of Loch Ken.  In great falls of rain, the rivers
Dee and Ken rise near 7 feet perpendicular, by which large
tracks of meadow and low land are laid under water.  Whem
these happen in hay time, or in harvest, they greatly da-
mage, and often carry away large quantities of hay and
corn.  They come so suddenly, that there is no guarding
against them.  But is in winter, which is oftenest the case,
they rather better the land.

   Lakes, etc.-There are 6 lochs, besides Loch Ken, 3 of
which, on the north end of the parish, are stored with
