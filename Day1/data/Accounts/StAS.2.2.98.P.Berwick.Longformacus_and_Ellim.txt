residence of the heritors and of some of the principal tenants, and
the non-attendance of others, the collections are small; they may
be stated at L. 8 per annum. There are at present two old women
who receive regular, and four individuals who receive occasional,
charity from the kirk-session. Five shillings a month, with house
rent and firing, has been the usual allowance for a pauper receiv-
ing regular assistance. The disposition to refrain from seeking pa-
rochial relief may still be seen in this parish, but it is fast wearing
away.
   Inn.-There is an inn in the small village of Longformacus.
The people are generally sober, and no injurious effects are per-
ceptible from the existence of this inn.
   Fuel.-The fuel of the country, here generally called eldin, con-
sists of dried turf, peats, and cuttings from the plantations. Coal is
brought from England at considerable expense. When delivered
at Longformacus, it costs, at an average, 10d. per cwt. The best
peats are got from one of the moors towards the southern part of
the parish. In a favourable year, such as 1831, when well dried,
they make good firing; but the expense of cutting, winding, drying,
and leading, together with the rapidity with which they burn, makes
the cost of them little inferior to that 6f coals.
