   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is a copious sulphureous
spring near Kirkurd-house.  A chemical analysis was made
of it some years ago by Dr Black of Edinburgh, by which it
was found to be stronger than the sulphureous water at Mof-
fat, but weaker than that at Harrogate.  It has been used of
late with success in several distempers.  Coal, peat, and turf,
are all used here for fuel.  In gentlemens families, coals are
always burnt; they are situated at 8 or 9 miles distance.
Peats, to a great extent and depth, and of a very superior
quality, are found in one farm in this parish; they are not
cast.  The tenants have a privilege of casting peats in diffe-
rent mosses in the parish of Linton, and consequently avail
themselves of that privilege.
   Until 1752, the large estate of Kirkurd was the resident
property of Geddes of Rachan for 1100 years, while Rachan,
from whence the title was taken, is reported to have been in
the possession of the Geddes's for 1300 years.  James Ged-
des of Rachan was born in this parish in 1710, was educated
for, and practised several years at, the bar, but died of a con-
sumption before he arrived at the age of 40.  He published
an Essay on the Composition and Manner of Writing of the
Ancients, and left behind him several other tracts*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*In the parks of Kirkurd are two small mounts, called the
Castle and Law.  They are surrounded with a dike of an irre-
gular form.  Mr Gordon, in his Itinerary, thinks them artifi-
cial, but does not form any conjecture as to their use.  There is
to the east of these, a circular fortification on an eminence near
Ladyurd, called the Rings, and another to the west, on the farm
of Lochurd, called the Chesters; hence they are supposed to
have been a military erection; and a place called Comprigend,
mile south to the last of these, farther confirms this idea.
