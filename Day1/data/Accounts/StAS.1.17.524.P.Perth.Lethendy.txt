the loss is perhaps more than balanced by its beneficial influ-
ence upon population and morals.  By dividing their time
betwixt the labours of the field, and their occupations within
doors, they are vigorous and healthy, their offspring accor-
dingly are numerous and robust; they grow up in the habits
of temperance and industry, and are strangers to those courses
of dissipation and vice, to which the youth in great towns are
ever exposed, and often fall a sacrifice.

   Produce.-This parish produces, annually, 1614 bolls of
oats, 1100 bolls of barley, 100 bolls of wheat, 100 bolls of
pease, Linlithgow measures 250 stone of lint, Amsterdam;
and there are, besides, from 40 to 50 acres under potatoe and
turnip crops.  The returns from the seed in oats and barley,
are from 5 to 8, in wheat from 10 to 12.  The produce, in
lint is from 20 to 25 stone per acre, and in potatoes from 40
to 60 bolls.

   Woodlands.-There are in this parish from 50 to 60 acres
of natural wood, consisting chiefly of oak, birch, and, hazle,
which, from its situation on the highest ground of the dis-
trict, and being surrounded with rich corn fields, both varies
and beautifies the scene.  It is cut generally once in 20 years,
and is valuable, chiefly on account of the bark.  There is,
besides this, a considerable quantity of ash around the
farm houses, sufficient, perhaps, for supplying the parish with
the implements of husbandry.

   Live Stock.-Horses.-There are in this parish 104 horses.
Since the introduction of two horse ploughs, the breed has
been considerably improved.  They are now of a middle size,
and sell at from 12 l. to 18 l. each.  A few more are reared
