     No. VI. Circular Note, 1st November 1794.

   SIR JOHN SINCLAIR presents his best compliments.  He sets out in a
few days for London; but hopes, before he goes, to have the pleasure
of receiving the few Statistical Accounts which are still deficient.  The re-
maining volumes, which complete the Work, are to be left under the
charge of Sir Henry Moncriess, Dr Hardie, and Mr Walker of the Canon-
gate; and Sir John Sinclair will send the account of your parish, to be
edited by any of those gentlemen you may prefer.  It is very satisfactory to
think, that so great an undertaking is at last brought so near its conclu-

diers.

will be attended with great inconvenience, interrupting the whole progress
of the Work.  He wishes to have the repor transmitted to himself in the
first place, as he always chooses to peruse the Statistical Accounts previous
to their publication.
