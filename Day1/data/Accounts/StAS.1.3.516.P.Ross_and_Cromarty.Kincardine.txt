   General Character.-The character of the people here,
as in most places, is of a mixed nature.  Most of them
are moral in their lives, and when occasion requires, capa-
ble of unremitting industry.  In common with most other
Highlanders, they are hospitable, of quick parts, of great
agiligy, inquisitive and fond of information, and extremely
patient under hunger, cold, and other distresses, from which
their southern neighbours would shrink with horror.-They
still retain a facred regard for the clan and family they are
sprung from, but it must be allowed, that this feeling is on
the dicline.-The tale, the song, and the dance, do not, as
in the days of their fathers, gild the horrows of the winter
night.  If those of the present age have not all the ble-
ithes of their foresuhers, neither have they the whole of
their good qualities.  The moderns seem, both with regard
to bodily and mental faculties, to be declining.  One cause,
and perhaps the chief, is, the abundance of whisky introdu-
ced by the late dissling etc.  There are 4 stills in this pa-
rish, and more are in contimplation.  The retailing houses
are upwards of 30.  There destillerics are beneficial to indi-
vidual; but they seem to be making a rapid progess in de-
bauching the morals, impairing the strength, and affecting
the industry of the common people.
