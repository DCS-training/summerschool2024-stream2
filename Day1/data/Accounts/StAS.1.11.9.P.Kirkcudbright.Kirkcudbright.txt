   Rivers and Fish.-Various little streams, which abound
with trouts, and other small fish, flow in a meandering course
through this parish, and afford excellent amusement for such as
are fond of angling.  But the only river worth noticing, both
on account of its large size, and its extensive usefulness, is
the DEE, called by the ancient Romans Deva.  It rises' out
of Loch Dee, which is situated at the bottom of those hills
that separate Ayrshire from Galloway.  After running many
miles in a serpentine course, and receiving the waters of the
great river Ken, it flows a considerable way, till it reaches
the parish of kirkcudbright; then runs alongst the west side
from N. E. to S. W. and empties itself into the Solway
Frith.  The river Dee abounds with excellent salmon, sea
trouts and hirlines.  The salmon are sold here at different
prices, from 6 d. to 2 d. per pound.  They seldom begin to
run till the month of March, and then appear only in small
numbers.  In May and June they swim up in shoals, with
the tide, and are caught in great numbers.  They are sup-
posed to be in the highest perfection in the month of June,
and beginning of July.  Nothing can exceed the richness of
the salmon caught within the tide mark.  Their flesh, when
boiled, is generally intermixed with a white curd, which
feels hard; but if the fish are kept for a day or two, this curd
dissolves into oil.  To such as are unaccustomed to eat salmon
till several days after they are taken, the dissolved curd is
most agreeable.  Sea trouts make their appearance in the ri-
ver, during the month of June; the hirlines in July, and the
grilses in August.

   Fisheries.-The fisheries within this parish are let for about
4001. per annum, and belong to the Earl of SELKIRK, Mr.
MURRAY, and the town of Kirkcudbright.  Mr. Murray's
fishery lies in the upper part, both above the tide mark, and
