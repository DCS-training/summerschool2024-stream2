     Ecclesiastical State.-There are two parish churches, both in
   central parts in these islands.  The one in Stronsay was built in
   1821, the other in Eday, in 1816.  Besides these, there are two
   places of worship connected with the United Secession.  That in
   Stronsay was built in 1800, and that in Eday, in 1829.  The pa-
   rish minister in Stronsay, until about a year and a half ago, was
   wont to cross the Sound (in breadth four miles) every fourth Sab-
   bath, to preach in Eday.  But in the spring of 1834, the Com-
   mittee of the General Assembly for managing the Royal Bounty
   appointed the present missionary minister to officiate in Eday;
   and since that time, the parish of Eday has enjoyed the same be-
   nefit of public worship, every Sabbath, as Stronsay, which has
   been also benefited by this appointment, as the minister of Stron-
   say can devote all his attention to that parish.  Since the appoint-
   ment of a minister to Eday, a manse has been erected for his
   residence, partly by collections and subscriptions in Orkney and in
   the south; and partly by the assistance of the present incumbent
   in Stronsay.
     Education.-In these parishes, there are three principal schools.
   Two in Stronsay, and one in Eday.  Of those in Stronsay, one is
   the parochial school, and the other is supported by the Society for
