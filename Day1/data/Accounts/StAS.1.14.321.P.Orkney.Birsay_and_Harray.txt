places it will spring out of the rocks remarkably thin;
in other places of the country, it is found of the con-
sistence of pitch.  The parish has this advantage, that
part of it lies near the sea, and for that reason can have
fish and oil enough to serve this parish and other parish-
es beyond it:  At the same time, it is far from large bo-
roughs, and must labour under a great disadvantage,
by carrying its commodities to the towns of Kirkwall
and Stromness, which are the greatest markets in this
country.

   Language.-As to the language, it is English, mix-
ed with a Norwegian accent, owing to the ancient
connexion between the two countries, but is now much
bettered by our connexion with strangers, and by that
of such of our own young men as have been abroad*.

   Rent, Stipend, Poor, etc.-The valued rent of the pa-
rish is 3144 L. 11 s. Scots; the real rent depends upon the
fiars, which are always at the will of the heritors.  The

*All our names are derived from the Norwegian language.  Every
hill and every dale are of Norwegian derivation in this parish; as
Reveybill, Garthma, Smeurquoy, that is to say, butter land, Smerrablets, as
is pronounced here, that is, where good grass grows, which makes but-

As to our meadows, they are always called Seaters.  Though I am little
acquainted with the Norwegian language, I understand a Seater to be a
place for maintaining milch cows; and these Seaters are to this moment
properly adapted for it:  we have many in this parish, namely, Kirk-seater
Isbi-seater, Seater, Fol-seater, Overby-seater, Eastby-seater, etc.
