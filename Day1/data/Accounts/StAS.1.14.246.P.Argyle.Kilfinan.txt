from 10 L. to 24 L. to the share, the boat having an equal
dividend with each of the hands.  These are only the
most successful, and who attend the fishing closely, from
the beginning to the end of the season.  There are
many others who follow the trade, but having also a
small share of a farm or a butt, give only a partial
attendance; and the shares of these are generally found
at the end of the season to be very inconsiderable.  Be-
sides the number of hands this employed at home in
this trade, there is a great number, of both married and
unmarried men, who go to the North Highlands aboard
of the bounty vessels, and their wages in general are
from 1 L. 5 s. to 1 L. 16 s. a month, with a barrel or half
a barrel of herrings, according to the time they are out.
The vessels they go aboard of, are those which sail from
Greenock, Port-Glasgow, and Rothsay.

   Inns.-There are 11 inns or public-houses in the pa-
rish.  Two of them are flated, but all of them in very
bad repair, and so exceedingly ill kept, that a traveller
can scarcely get a decent bed, or a comfortable break-
fast, in the best of them.

   Road and Bridges.-There are only 3 small bridges
in the parish, and the roads are exceeding bad; notwith-
standing a good deal of money has been from time to 
time expended upon them, they are in some places ever
impassable.  This is partly owing to the very great
lenght of the line, and the extreme difficulty of making
it, and partly to the employing hitherto of country
people for making them, who did not understand the
business.  By these ignorant undertakers, a great deal
has been blocked out, and no part properly finished;
