       Name, Boundaries, Extent, &c.-IT is difficult to say what is the

    a corruption of "Canute's bay." Others imagine it to be from the
    plant Canna, which seems to have been at one time very abundant

    name is spelt Cannasbay.
        The figure of the parish is on the whole exceedingly regular.
    It forms the north-east corner of Scotland; and is bounded on
    the east, by the German Ocean; on the north, by the Pentland

    by the parishes of Bower and Wick. From east to west along the
    Pentland Frith the length is upwards of 8 miles; and from north
