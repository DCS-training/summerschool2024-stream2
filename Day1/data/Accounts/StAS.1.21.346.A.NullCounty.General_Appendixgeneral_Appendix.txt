tion with the rivers Forth and Teith: and hence the advan-
tage of making these rivers navigable.
   The principal commodities required for agriculture and
domestic consumpt in the districts described, are pit-coal and
lime.  The country to the east of Stirling produces coal and
limestone in great abundance at many places; but no coal
has been discovered west from Bannockburn.  Limestone is
produced from the quarries of Abersoil, about a mile west
from the bridge of Gartmore, and from the quarries at Le-
ny, a mile beyond Callander; but the carriage of coal to burn
the limestone is nearly equal to that of the lime shells when
burnt, so that the limestone here without coal is of little be-
nefit.
   Many attempts have been made to get a canal along the
Forth, or the river made navigable to Gartmore.  It was once
tried to bring the great canal that now unites the Forth and
Clyde round by Stirling and Gartmore; but that measure
failing, the gentlemen interested seem to have lost spirit,
which shews that they had not viewed the matter in its true
light.  In the year 1774, a very accurate survey was made of
the river Forth, and of the smaller rivers Devon and Goodie
that run into it; and an estimate of making these rivers na-
vigable was drawn up, and reported to a very respectable
meeting of the noblemen and gentlemen of the counties
of Stirling, Perth, and Clackmanan, on the 13th January
I774, and who voted several resolutions thereon; a copy
whereof is annexed.  The matter seems however to have
dropt after this, which proves evidently how superficially the
plan had been viewed by the people in general.  Some men
cannot submit to the fatigue of enquiry and calculation; the
time of others is occupied by pursuits of a different nature;
and some doubt every thing that bears the character of no-
velty, and on such topics will discredit even their own calcu-
