     Statistical Account

   The stationary birds are of the common kinds.  Plenty of
partridges, grouse, black game, plovers, and water-fowl of
various species.  The migratory birds are pretty numerous.
They are the bernacle or rood-goose, the woodcock, land-
rail, lapwing, cuckcoo, fieldfare, redwing, swallow, moun-
tain-finch or snow-flake, and sometimes the Boherrian chat-
terer.  The latter appears seldom, but then it comes in great
flocks, feeding upon the berry of the mountain-ash; all the 
former are very plentiful in this past.

   Trees.-The vegetable productions of the parish are such
as are common to the whole country.  There are few trees
indeed of spontaneous growth, except elders, which abound-
ed much some years ago, but are now rapidly giving place to 
corn and grass fields.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The following circumstances are somewhat curious.  The
year 1783 was a year of great scarcity, and the births of the
succeeding year were 16 below the average, and 14 below the
lowest number of any of the other late years.  The year 1787,
on the contrary, was a year of plenty, and the following year
the births increased in a similar proportion.  They were 17
above the average, and 11 above the number of any of the o-
ther years.
