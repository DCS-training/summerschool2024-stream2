savoys, spinage, beets, turnips, carrots, parsnips, onions, and
all sorts of kitchen stuff, may be reared in abundance, as al-
so pot, aromatic, and medicinal herbs, by due attention.

   Cattle.-The county at large, as well as this parish in par-
ticular, abounds with black cattle; considerable numbers of
which young and old are purchased by drovers at from 40 s.
to 50 s. per head, and are driven to Falkirk, Edinburgh, and
England.  It is here asserted, that the shore or lowland,
drive fully as well as the highland, cattle.  Horse coupers or
dealers buy up in summer all the year-old garron stags or
colts they can find, which they send over to Orkney; and sell
with profit.  There the Orkney men, after keeping and
working for 3 or 4 years, resell when full grown, perhaps
at double the price, according to their age and appearance;
so that when they are brought back to Caithness, the farmer
must give such a price for them that he pays for their keep-
ing in Orkney, more than they would have cost had they re-
mained in Caithness.  These horses, called here garrons, are a
small breed, between 4 and 4 1/2 feet high, very hardy, re-
quiring little care, and living in winter on fodder with little
or no corn.

   Ploughs.-Four of those garrons,* or sometimes four
oxen, are yoked in a plough a-breast, and not two and two
in the long draught as in other places.  So much attached
are farmers here, and even the farm servants of gentlemen, to
this custom, that they will by no means alter their method;
alleging, that, in a short yoke, they can easier raise the
plough over rocky land, do more work, and draw with more
advantage, particularly when the ridges are crooked, than in
the long way.  This aukward method cannot be approved of
by good judges.  The short draught or four a-breast is never

*Horses of a larger size than the garron, if fit for the car-
riage or the saddle, are called here court horses.
