heronry at Shaw on Dryfe, where some hundreds are bred
yearly, and have been so, past all account of the place.
The number of breeders do not seem to have increased in
the memory of man, though they are rather protected than
otherwise.  They bring fish for their young, a pound weight,
from the lakes of Lochmaben; 8 or 10 miles distant.  In
the Cocklawgill at Mackmaw, a falcon has bred, past me-
mory of man.  They are reckoned of the Isle of Man, or
true game kind.  The male is of a very light blue colour;
the female a dark marbled brown, and by much stronger
than the male.  They have been taken and bred to hunt,
and are reckoned to excel.  The herds, for 10 miles round,
are acquainted with the male, and few of them but have
shared of his prey.  The moor-cock stands him but one
stroke; and when a herd is in sight, and not far distant, he
commonly gets the game.  The female hawk has been
sometimes shot.  The male disappears, but returns in a
few days with another female.  There are other hawks
and kites of various kinds.  But the most destructive of all
ravenous animals to game and to sheep also, is the small
raven, which in this part of the country is entirely black,
but is the same with the grey or hooded crow of other
parts of Scotland.

   Fishes.  The three waters mentioned are well supplied
with tront; grilses and salmon-trout come far up in 
them in the spawning time.  They do not meet with the
same protection they do in most other waters in Scotland
at that season.  It is little wonder they should not, in the
small waters of this parish, where the people are not be-
nesited by them when the fish is of more value.  But it is
surprising, that even proprietors of fishings upon Annan
kill salmon down to November, and see them destroyed
