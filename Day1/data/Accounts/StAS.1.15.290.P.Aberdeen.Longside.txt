cumstances attending their collection (circumstances fre-
quently incompatible with the usefulness of a clergyman,)
but failed.
   The family of Marischall, which had formerly very consi-
derable property in the parish, were the original patrons; pro-
bably in consequence of the canonical rule; Patronum fa-
ciunt, dos, odifitatio, sundus.  The right of presenting is now
annexed to the Crown.  The present incumbent has no
manse, but receives in lieu of it an annuity from the heritors.
The original church still remains; but has been repaired at
different times.
   Under this head, the situation of the school ought to be
mentioned; as being (the writer of the present article would
gladly hope singular.  The salary is only nine bolls of meal,
which the schoolmaster has to collect from the tenants in
very small quantities, and of consequence at a great loss.  The
emoluments arising from teaching, owing to the very low
price of education, (for the schoolmaster is acknowledged to
be well qualified for his office) are, at an average of eight
years, 4 L. 6 s. 7 d. a year.  Perquisites arising from his offices,
as precenter and clerk to the session, do not exceed 4 L. Ster-
ling.  Of consequence, his whole living does not amount to
more than 12 L. Sterling annually; a sum not equal to the
wages of an ordinary farm-servant.  When it is considered
of how much consequence it is to society (particularly, at a
period when the principles of the lower ranks are of insini-
tely more consequence to its welfare than ever they were be-
fore,) to have persons properly qualified for the education of
youth appointed in the different parishes, the circumstances
above mentioned seem to demand attention from heritors,
and others whom the law authorises to provide for the pro-
per maintenance of schoolmasters.
