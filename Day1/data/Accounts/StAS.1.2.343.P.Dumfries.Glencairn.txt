advantage might be expected so this part of the country in ge-
neral, and particularly to Minniehive.  That village, and its
neighbourhood, are much at a loss for fuel.  Peats must be
brought at the distance of at least 6 or seven miles; and coals
from Sanquhar, which is not less than 13 computed miles.-
Trials for coals, at different times, have been made in several
places much nearer, with a good prospect of success; but, af-
ter all, they have hitherto proved fruitless.
   The land in general is good.  The holms and meadows up-
on the sides of the rivers, are fertile.  Next to these, on the
rising grounds, there is a light, warm, kindly, arable soil;
and, in the highest parts, there is fine pasture for all sorts of
cattle, particularly sheep.  The rivers are very rapid, and often
overflow their banks, to the great damage of the land adja-
cent.
   The people are, in general, healthy; and several, now a-
live, as well as others lately dead, have arrived at 80 years of
age, and upwards.  Their houses and dress, of late, have been
much improved; and, in the latter of these respects, people
of every class seem to be running into an extreme.  The man-
ners of the people, in general, are very agreeable, mild, cour-
teous, and obliging; and they are distinguised for hospitali-
ty, and natural civility to strangers.-The diseases, which
prevail most, are rheumatisms, and pains in the stomach and
bowels; owing, perhaps, to the low and damp situation of
their houses, most of which are placed too near the rivers.-The
water is of an excellent quality; light, clear, and soft.  The
streams abound with trout, as the hills do with game.
   Property has, of late, been much divided, by the sale of
some large estates, particularly, that of Sir Robert Laurie of
Maxwelltown.  There are now 27 heritors.  Some years ago,
there were only 18.
