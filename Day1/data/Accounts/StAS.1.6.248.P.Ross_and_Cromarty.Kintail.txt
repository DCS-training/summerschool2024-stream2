which there horses labour the ground is of a singular construc-
tion: The two handles are almost perpendicular; the plough-
man therefore stands in an erect position.  Four horses all in
a breast pull against the beam in thongs of leather cords, ge-
nerally made of the skins of deers.  Behind the ploughman, a
man follows with a spade to compress the strong furrows which
resisted the side boards.  The driver confronts the ploughman,
holding the reins of the horses collected in a cross stick 3 feet
long: in this aukward position, the driver moves backward;
and neither example nor precept can convince the people of a
better mode of culture.- Horses for the plough are sold at
L. 6 or L. 7 sterling.

   Agriculture, Produce, etc.-Sowing commences about the
beginning of April, and continues to the end of May: This
period is occupied in sowing oats, barley, and particularly po-
tatoes; the greatest attention is bestowed on this root, as it
makes up more than one-half year's subsistence, with the fish
and herring Lochduich furnishes in the months of August and
September.-Every tenant who farms L. 20 rent, generally
has 20 milch-cows, and sows 4 bolls of oats, and half a boll
of barley.  Indeed, as is already observed, the great aim is to
have a plentiful crop of potatoes; for the other crops have a
variety of weathers to encounter, and cannot therefore be de-
pended upon.  The most competent judges of the soil and cli-
mate, suggest the plan of raising potatoes and green crops as
the best Highland farming scheme.-It is customary to cut
down a great quantity of natural grass in the month of August;
which, after receiving proper seasoning, is made into ropes of
two fathoms in length, and then twisted two-fold: being thus
compressed, it requires less room in barns, where all their crops
are laid up.  This process has another advantage; for, in this
mode, it is carried with the greater facility, into distant glens,
