and potatoes, (the other half bare-fallow for wheat.) deducting 32
acres for potatoes, there remains 334 acres of turnips at L. 5 per acre, L. 1670 0  0
 Note.-Leguminous crops are of trifling extent, the soil being un-
fit for them.
The hay is not allowed to be carried off the land, but is used for
 winter food of horses, &c. Its value may therefore be rated with
the pasture land, which, after the above deductions, will be 2220
acres at L. 3 per acre,                                                     6660 0  0

   Means of Communication, &c.-The only village is Fogo,-which
has a population of thirty-five persons. There are two turnpike
roads passing through the parish; the one from the west is the
great road to Berwick and the Chain or Suspension bridge, which
serves as a communication with Northumberland, for the importa-
tion of lime and coal: it joins the Edinburgh road 1 1/2 miles east
from Greenlaw, and its length is four miles. The other, from
Coldstream to Dunse, two miles long, crosses the parish in the
east end. Both roads are Macadamized, and the tolls are with-
out the parish. The length of the whole roads within the parish
is about sixteen miles.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is the only place of pub-
lic worship, and is situate nearly, in the centre of the parish. At
what time it was built is unknown. The walls and roof were re-
paired in 1755, and having been re-seated and plastered in 1817,
the church is now in a good condition. It contains about 200 per-
sons, and the seats are all free.
   The last two Episcopal ministers were Messrs Methven, father
and son, whose monuments are still remaining in the churchyard,
with the inscriptions legible. They were succeeded by John Pringle,
in 1659; William Home, in 1722; John Todd, in 1785; George
Moodie, in 1693; William Home, in 1757; George M'Lean, in
1814.
   The only benefactions are, a mortification of about L. 6 a-year,
paid out of the lands of Charter-Hall and Harcarse, for the poor;
and a bursary to St Andrews, in the gift of Mortonhall.
   The manse and offices were built in 1787, and repaired in 1814
and 1822. They are in good condition.
   The glebe contains eleven acres five perches English, exclusive
of fences, but including the garden and site of the buildings. The
soil is a deep loam of excellent quality, and might let from L. 25
to L. 30. The stipend, which was a trifle above eleven chalders, was
augmented to fifteen chalders, half meal, half barley, in 1830, with
