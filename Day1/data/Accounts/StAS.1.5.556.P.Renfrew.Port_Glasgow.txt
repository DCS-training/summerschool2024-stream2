called, built an elegant house of worship, in the suburbs of
the town, sufficient to contain about 1800 people, in which
they are accommodated, for the purposes of public wor-
ship, in a stile superior to most kirks in Scotland.  The
annual revenue of this chapel, arising from the rents of the
seats, amounts to L. 140 Sterling; and the living of the
minister is L. 100 per annum.

   Schools and Poor.-There are three public schools in
this town, viz. a Grammar, a Writing and Arithmetic,

and for teaching English, 3 s. per quarter.  The number
of scholars, is, at an average, about 50 at each school.-

place, in proportion to their necessities, so long as that

gular marriages; from the interest of L. 290 Sterling,
which the heritors hold upon a bill to the session, and from
an assessment of the inhabitants.  In the year 1790, the
