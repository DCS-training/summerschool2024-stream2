     Statistical Account

   Wood.-The wood market has already begun briskly,
and will shortly be great.  One heritor draws a hundred a-
year, for 7 years, for the cutting of one fir park, which will
be planted again when it is cleared.  He has another ready
for selling down, and severals rising in succession.  So that
moderation in cutting, and diligence in planting again what
is cleared, will bring the business to a very considerable

   Villages, Inns, and Still,-There are villages at Broom of
Moy, Kintefak, and Dyke; at which last there is an inn,
near the post road, and another inn at the Ferry Boat, on
the east side of the river; and no other inns or alehouses.

Barley-mill, near the fords of the Beg-Bourne, at the colt of
L. 114, 7 s.  Sterling, out of 5 1/2 years of the stipends accruing

horse and mail can pass.  Three small stone bridges were
also built on the public road, of the same fund, for L. 30,
14 s.

   State of the Church.-A new and commodious church, of
66 by 33 feet, inside, was built in 1781, at the expence of
the heritors, for the sum of L. 525, beside the carriages per-
