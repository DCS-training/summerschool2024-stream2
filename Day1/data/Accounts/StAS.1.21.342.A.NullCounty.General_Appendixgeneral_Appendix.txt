     APPENDIX TO THE STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF
     THE PARISH OF KILMADOCK.

     By Mr ALEXANDER M 'GIBBON OF STIRLING.

     Observations on the advantages of Navigable Canals;
     with a scheme for navigating the rivers Forth and
     Devon.

   THE power and wealth of a nation are said to depend on
the labour of the people.  We do not however find labour
always productive of power or wealth; one man soils inces-
santly from day to day, and at the year's end hath profited
nothing; while his neighbour, by the employment of a few
hours in the day, or a few days in the year, supports himself
in a superior manner, and lays by a considerable capital.
The one is unproductive; the other is productive labour.
The former gains his recompence by bodily strength alone;
the latter unites bodily strength with art.  Unproductive la-
bour, or labour Produced by bodily strength, is confined to
a few obvious exertions, dependent wholly on the strength
and agility of the individual, subject to sickness, langour, and
decay, and exposed to a thousand accidents; productive la-
bour, or, in other words, the labour of art, is infinite in va-
riety, of boundless power, incapable of changes and never-
wearied by exertion.  Hence the riches of individuals; hence
wealth of nations; hence the power of states; and hence
the splendour of civilized society.
