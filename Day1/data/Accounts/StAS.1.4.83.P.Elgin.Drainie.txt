     of Drainy.

   The number of inhabitants has not varied much for these
last 20 years; vibrating generally from 1020 to 1050.
   In general, the climate of this country is mild and whole-
some.  There is more dry weather in the narrow slip a-
long the Moray-shire coast, than in most other parts in
Scotland, owing to the land being very low and plain,
and the clouds being attracted by the high hills to
the southward; so that often in summer, when this parish
is burned up with drought, rain falls in abundance in
the high country.  One happy consequence of this pe-
culiar situation is the goodness of the harvests; even in
1782 the greatest part of the crop here was got in without
damage.-There are no extraordinary instances of lon-
gevity here, nor are there any diseases peculiar to this di-
strict.  Agues were very common about 25 or 30 years a-
go, in the marshy parts of Drainy and Dussus, but have
for some time past totally disappeared.  The complaints
that prevail most among the lower classes of people, are
obstinate coughs and colds, attended with pain of the breast,
difficulty of breathing, and swelling in the extremities, es-
pecially in the winter-season, and are very fatal.  They
seem to be occasionesd by the coldness and dampness of 
the houses, and the great scarcity of fuel, for there are no
peats nearer than the distance of 10 measured miles.  If
the attention of Government could be awakened to the
many evils arising from the impolitic tax on coals, and 
could be prevailed upon to substitute some other revenue
in its stead, it would be of essential benefit to the North of
Scotland in general, and to this province in particular.

   Produce, Rent, etc.-All the kinds of grain raised in
Scotland succeed here; but barley is the principal crop.
Flax is also cultivated, but to no great extent.  Potatoes
thrive admirably well in our light ground, and serve for
