greatly enliven that hitherto dreary and desolate tract of country.

	There have been 12 illegitimate births during the last three years,
The number is on the decline; and there has been a considera-
ble improvement of morals in this respect. Instances of this kind
have of late years been generally followed by marriage.
	The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture.
The rest are fishers, day-labourers, and country artisans.

	Husbandry.--It is difficult to estimate the amount and value
of the raw produce of the parish, from the unwillingness of some
to give the necessary information.  As far as it could be ascertained,
it is as follows:

<TABLE>
            Oats,      6000 bolls at 17s. per boll,        L.5100
	    Wheat,     2000 do.	     24r.  	do.          2400

        Rye-grass,      400 do       200 stories do.         2000
                                                           ------

	Agriculture is as well understood, and practised with as much
success here, as in the other districts of the country. The lower
lands on Dhuisk, Lendal, and Stinchar are in general well enclosed
and subdivided. The usual rotation adopted is a five-shift, consist-
ing of green crop, barley or wheat, sown down with grass, the gross
cut the first, and pastured the second year, and oats. The abundance
of sea weed, and lime, and of late, the introduction of bone manure
have contributed greatly to the improvement of the soil; and the
towns of Girvan, Ayr, Kilmarnock, Glasgow, and Liverpool, af-
ford a ready and excellent market for every article of produce.
