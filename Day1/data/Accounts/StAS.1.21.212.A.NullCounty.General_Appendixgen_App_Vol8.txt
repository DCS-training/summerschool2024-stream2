parishes, is neglected; the salary,only 7 bolls of barley;
and the school fees so small, that no body thinks it worth
their while to accept of it, unless some young lad for a
year or two.  It seems the present generation of landholders
with to extirpate learning altogether, in order to introduce
ignorance and slavery among the lower class of peoples else
they would give some encouragement to schoolmasters; and
the opposition given to a late application to Parliament for
augmenting the schoolmasters salaries by the landed gen-
tlemen, clearly marks their intentions.

   Cattle, etc.-There are few sheep in this parish.  About
500, of a small size, are maintained on the benty hills near
the sea coast, but when fed are most delicious eating.
   The farmers use horses chiefly for labouring and draughts
of all kinds.
   There is little or no meadow pasture, therefore black cat-
tle are neglected though about 20 years ago, they were
more numerous, and consequently the crops of corn more
plentiful:- but as horses can be used with fewer servants, the
farmers find it necessary to prefer them to oxen.-There is
no market in the parish.  At Elgin and Forres there are seve-
ral fairs; from these the people are supplied with their neces-
saries, and to these they must carry every article they can af-
ford to fell, which occasions much loss of time.  There are
no distillers of spirits here.  There are 5 or 6 houses in which
ale and whiskey are sold; to these the people resort when they
are to transact business either in selling or burring.
   There is a remarkable circumstance in this parish of a farm
called Crosshill.  It has been occupied by one family, of the
name of Falconers for 450 years back; and the tenant's name
was James and Alexander, alternately.  The last of them died
only two years ago; this I can attest by some receipts for rents,
