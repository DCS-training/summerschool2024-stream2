     THE STORM,

   A Poem, by Dr WILKIE, Author of the Epigoniad, &c.
and composed before he was 10 years old, while at the
School of Dalmeny.

   WHAT penetrating mind can rightly form
A faint idea of raging storm?
Who can express of elements the war;
And noisy thunder roaring from afar?
This subject is superior to my skill;
Yet I'll begin to show I want not will.
   A pitchy cloud displays itself on high;
And with its fable mantle veils the sky:
Fraught with the magazines of heaven does throw
Bolts barb'b with fire upon the world below.
All nature shakes and the whole heavens smoke;
Nor can the gross black cloud sustain the shock:
But op'ning from its magazines doth roll,
Thick smoke and flames of fire from pole to pole.
Thence hail, snow, vapour, mixed with flames of fire,
With conjunct force against the earth conspire.
Monsters of sea and land, do loudly roar,
And make the deep resound from shore to shore.
The spumy waves come rolling from afar
And with loud jars declare the wat'ry war.
They upward mount and raise their crests on high,
And beat the middle regions of the sky.
Downwards they fall upon the swelling deep,
And toss the rigging of some low sunk ship:
Upwards they tow'r and falling down again,
They bury men and cargo in the main.
The boiling deep doth from her low sunk cell.
Throw out black waves resembling those of Hell.
They forward roll and hideously do roar,
And vent their rage against the rocky shore.
