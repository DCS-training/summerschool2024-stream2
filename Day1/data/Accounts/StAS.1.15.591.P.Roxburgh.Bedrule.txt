     of Bedrule.

   Advantages.-This parish is situated in the centre of
prosperous though not very populous county, intersected by
the great road between Berwick and Carlistle, touched on by
a branch of the London road to Edinburgh, not more than
two miles distant from Jedburgh, about 7 miles from Hawick,
both excellent market towns.  The land is in general of a dry
soil, yet watered by a considerable number of springs, rivu-
lets and brooks, in most places of easy access and at con-
venient distances from each other.  Besides, upon the West
and North it is for the most part bounded by the before men-
tioned pure and copious streams of the Rule and the Tiviot.

   Disadvantages.-The great distance from coal, the bad-
ness of the road from Spittal bridge to the southern extre-
mity of the parish, by which the people in this part of the
country, usually pass or make a great circuit, to Reid, in
Northumberland, for coal, and Windburgh, a considerable
mountain on the borders of Liddysdale, for lime; and the
badness of that from Bedrule to Jedburgh, the nearest mar-
ket town, are disadvantages not only to this parish, but also to
the neighbourhood, and which, with no great difficulty, may,
and, we hope, soon will be removed, as both these roads,
run, in general, on a gentle declivity and favourable bot-
tom, and are near excellent materials.

   Conclusion.-It will be observed, that the writer of the fore-
going Statistical Account has avoided repeating the same
things, so properly taken notice of in the accounts of the va-
rious parishes in this part of the country, already published;
and, therefore, whensoever that is felt as a defect by the
readers, it will be only necessary for him to suppose, that the
inhabitants of the parish of Bedrule have nearly the same re-
ligious and political sentiments; predilections and prejudi-
