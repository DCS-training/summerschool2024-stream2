     of Harris.

Scaire, through which the tide passes with the most impetu-
ous current known about these coasts.  These islands lie in a
line from S. to N. along the S. W. end of Harris.  The inter-
mediate opening is most commonly called the Sound of Har-
ris, and is most frequented by shipping.  Calligray is about 2
miles long, and a mile broad.  The S. end is a deep moss,
and for the most part uncultivated; the N. end a sandy soil
well cultivated.  To the northward of this island lies Ensay,
in size and shape nearly the same as Calligray, being verdant
all over, and having a good soil well cultivated.
   Of the uninhabited islands belonging to the southern divi-
sion, some are of considerable extent: A few of them may
measure a mile in length, and about half a mile in breadth.
They are covered with heath and moss, and afford pretty
good summer pasturage.  The shores are lined with sea-weed.
The people of the four islands, already described, repair to
them with their families and cattle, in the season of kelp-
manufacturing.  Here most of them get peats for fuel, there
being no moss in any of the inhabited islands of this district,
excepting Calligray; and, to procure this necessary article,
some of them have to go through a most dangerous naviga-
tion, the distance of almost three leagues.  The names of
the largest isles are Hermitray, Hulmitray, Saartay, Voter-
say, Neartay, Opsay, Vaaksay, Haay, Suursay, Torogay,
Scarvay, Lingay, Groay, Gillsay, Sagay, Stromay, Skeilay,
Copay.  There is, besides these, a vast number of islets,
holmes, and high rocks, for each of which the people have
names.  It is remarkable, that as the names of the larger isles
terminate in ay, so the names of these last generally terminate
in em, e. g. Tuem, Cuadem, Coddem, etc.  From an emi-
nence near the Sound may be had a very curious view of the
odd intermixture of land, rock, and water, which fills the
space betwixt the mainland of Uist and the mainland of Har-
