   Language.-The language of the common people in this
parish, like many of the parishes in the neighbourhood, is
a mixture of Scotch and English.  This jargon is very un-
pleasant to the ear, and a great impediment to fluent con-
versation.  No language is more expressive than the Scotch,
when spoken in perfection; and, though the ancient be shrot
and unmusical, yet it is by no means disagreeable to hear
two plain country men conversing in the true Scotch
tongue; but, in this parish, you seldom meet with such in-
stances.-In the quarter towards Callander, the generality
of the inhabitants speak Gaelic; and this is perhaps still
more corrupt than even the Scotch, in the other quarters of
the parish.  It is impossible to conceive any thing so truly
offensive to the ear, as the conversation of these people.
The true Gaelic is a noble language, worthy of the fire of
Ossian, and wonderfully adapted to the genius of a warlike
nation; but the contemptible language of the people about
Callander, and to the east, is quite incapable of communica-
ting a noble idea.
   It ought, therefore, to be earnestly recommended to the
people of this parish, and, indeed, to other parishes in that
quarter, to study a more perfect style; either to practice the
true Gaelic, the true Scotch, or the true English tongue.
   But all kinds of civilization in society go hand in hand;
and when arts and sciences begin to flourish here, the lan-
guage will gradually polish and refine.

   Character of the People.-In this district a simplicity of
manners, peculiar to rural felicity, has, for a long time, pre-
vailed.  A stranger to deceit, the honest farmer whistles
