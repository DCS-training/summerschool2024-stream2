   Manufacture of Kelp-This valuable, and, as it may now
be considered, staple commodity of Orkney, (was first of all
in this county manufactured in the island of Stronsay, by
James Fea, heritable proprietor of Whitehall,) and Wadset-
ter of North Strynrie, in the year 1722.  This was a gentle-
man of an enterprising spirit, who brought a man of the name
of Meldrum, from Frasersburgh, to introduce kelp burning
in Orkney; Meldrum, taking the Orkney inhabitants to be an
ignorant and superstitious race of men, pretended that the kelp
ashes would not acquire such a hard and solid consistence as
was requisite, unless a certain powder was thrown into the
kelp kilne before it was raked, accompanied with certain mys-
terious words, to the use of which powder and mysterious
words, he claimed an exclusive right in that island.
   He, however, soon found, that the inhabitants of Stronsay
had more penetration and less superstition, than to be long
hood-winked in this manner; for they found, on trial, that the

to ly unmolested, during the winter, and until the weather sets in fair in
spring, which it seldom does before March or April; after which, their whole
agricultural labour must be executed, before the kelp season begins, in the
month of May, or be done afterwards in a very superficial manner; from
which causes, an extra number of servants and horses become necessary,
which tends greatly to increase the expence of labour to the Orkney
farmer.  The considerable heritors in Orkney, with very few exceptions,
have either removed with their families, from their mansions in the country,
to reside in Kirkwall, the only Royal Burgh in Orkney; or have, with their
families, left the county altogether; and therefore, they find few opportuni-
ties of attending to the proceedings or rewarding the meritorious exertions
of their tenants.  From these circumstances, the present unimproved state of
the country in general, may be easily accounted for.
   Instead of Improving the soil, the heritors and tenants in Orkney, have
for many years past, directed their attention to the manufacture of kelp.
