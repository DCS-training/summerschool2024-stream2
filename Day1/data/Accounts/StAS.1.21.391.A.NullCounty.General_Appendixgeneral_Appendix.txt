have frequently a cow maintained summer and winter by the
farmer, also whatever ground their dung can go over pro-
perly, for bears potatoes or lint.  Maid servants frequently
have land for a 1-fourth peck lowing of lint:  Cottars, of
which there are not many, get from the farmers, land for lint;
also what their dung will go over, for potatoes or bear:  Shep-
herds have sheep grazed, and if heads of families, a cow also
   The above statements show the whole connection of the
inhabitants with the lands.
   There are no bakers nearer than the village of Linton, nor
brewer than the burgh of Peebles; nor butcher except oc-

conveniency of weekly carriers to Edinburgh makes it
cheaper to get flesh, breads &c. from thence, than to send
on purpose elsewhere.  There are no law practioners nearer
than Peebles; no midwife nearer than Linton; nor surgeons
nearer than Linton or Peebles.
   Inoculation is in use, though prejudices are still enter-
tained against it, chiefly among the poorer classes.  It seems
uncertain whether or not inoculation for the small pox has
now any perceptible effect upon population.  The ravages of
the disease upon its first introduction into any country has al-
ways been greater, than what could be compensated by pro-
pagation under the most favourable circumstances; Upon its
familiarization with the climate or constitution of the inhabitants,
its annual waste would appear easily reparable by the annual
propagation.  In this state of the matter, though inocula-
tion may preserve the individual, it seems not necessary to the
preservation of the species.  It would be idle to suppose that, by
any contrivance for the preservation of the individual, the spe-
cies may be accumulated beyond the demand for labour, or, in
almost nearly the same words, the means of subsistence; and to
this extent population will of course ever be speedily carrried,
