     Statistical Account

One man died a few years ago, above 100; and 6 are now
alive, who are above 80.  The ague, which was very com-
mon about 30 years ago, is now scarcely heard of.  But in
places where this disorder was most prevalent, and especially
in the Carfe of Gowrie, it is observed that young people
are now more liable to consumptions than formerly.  The
jaundice also has of late become a more frequent disease.

   Rivers, Salmon, Fishing, etc.-There are no rivers which
run through this parish; the Tay, which washes its western
borders, being rather to be considered as its boundary, than
as making any part of it, excepting in one small spot opposite
to the church, where this noble river divides itself into 2
parts; and forms a small island; one half of which is in this
parish, and the other in the parish of Perth.  That branch of
the river which is in this parish, is called the Willow-gate.
But that which is next to Perth is the course which vessels of
burden usually hold, when going to Perth or Bridge-end;
but boats and small sloops often come up the Willow-gate, as
being a shorter passage.  Vessels from 90 to 100 tons burthen,
can easily make the shore of Bridge-end in spring-tides; and
when larger vessels are employed, part of their cargoes are
taken out (about 2 or 3 miles below Perth) and put into
boats, which are used as lighters, from Perth or Bridge end.
It is generally thought, that the Tay discharges more fresh
water into the sea, than any other river in great Britain.
The Tay abounds with excellent salmons and fine trouts of
different kinds, which are highly flavoured, and weigh from 2 to
6 pounds.  The greater part of the salmon fishing on the Tay,
are rented by a company in Perth, who employ a vail; number
of boats and fishermen.  They seldom expose their fish to sale
in Scotland, excepting at Perth; where the price of salmon
in the spring is sometimes 1 s, and sometimes 9 d per lib.;
