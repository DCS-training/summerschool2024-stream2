   Acres.-There are seven heritors or land proprietors.  They
all reside in the parish except the Earl of Eglinton, whose
property in it is but small.  Of the fix residing heritors,
three draw about five-sixths of the rent.  The arabic or col-
tivated ground in the parish is now all inclosed; about 400
acres of it possessed by the proprietors; 20 farms, and about
100 acres in small inclosures contiguous to the towns.  These
may comprehend altogether near .1500 acres.  About two
thirds of this inclosed ground is in pasture or hay.  The un-
inclosed and uncultivated sandy ground has never been pro-
perly measured.  It is visibly larger in extent than the for-
mer, and may be somewhere between 1600 and 1800 acres.
This extensive track, however valuable from the coal in its
bowels, yields nothing from the surface but a scanty provision
during the summer to about 50 cows; besides a rabbit-warren
in the west quarter of it, out of which they kill annually near
300 dozen.  The furs and the flesh are in value about 10 s.
the dozen.

   Agriculture.-The ground in the inclosures contiguous to
the town is generally let from 30 s. to 2 L. per acre.  The
average rent of the farms is just now about 13 s. an acre.
This will rise considerably at the expiration of the long and
cheap leases of four of the largest farms.  After that event,
there will scarcely be an acre under a guinea, the usual rate
of the new tacks or leases at present.  The farms are not
large.  At the end of the present tacks they will be still
smaller, the proprietors finding it their interest to subdivide
them.  By the late tacks, the farmers are bound to plow
