               		RUTHERGLEN.                          377

as Gallowflat, the property of Mr John Robertson Reid; Scotstown
of Mr John Gray; Stonclaw of Mr Charles Cunningham; Bank-
head of Mr Walter White, the present Provost of Rutherglen.
Elegant and commodious mansion-houses are built on these estates.
	The town's lands consist of the Green, a plain of 32 acres and
31 falls, lying between the town and the river. The soil is rich
and deep, owing to the accumulation of mud and decayed vege-
tables carried down the Clyde. It appears from the Municipal
Corporation Report that the other property of the burgh consists
of the Court hall, prison rooms, gaoler's house, &c., a schoolhouse,
schoolmaster's house, town-hall, and two other properties, the
whole supposed to be in value about L. 10,000.
	Climate.--As there are no known data in Rutherglen from which
to ascertain the beat and quantity of rain, the following is taken
from Cleland's Statistical Tables for Glasgow.
	The state of the thermometer in 1834 was ascertained at the
Cranston Hill Water-works, (separated from the parish of Ruther-
glen only by the Clyde) by Mr M'Kain, the scientific manager of
the works, who suspended one of Crichton's Fahrenheit thermo-
meters in an open well about twenty feet diameter, cradled with
stone, in a position apart from the rays of the sun, and enjoined
the day and night engineers, who are in constant attendance, to
mark the hourly state of the thermometer in a book, and from that
book Mr M'Kain constructed a table, exhibiting the temperature
hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The result was, an
average temperature during two years, from 1st January 1833, to
1st January 1835, 48.43.
	The greatest heat of the thermometer on 24th January 1834
was 44.37, and the least heat on the 29th, 33.12. Average heat
40.58. On the 18th February, 46.08; on the 13th, 32.25; ave-
rage, 40.08. On 6th December, 52.16; on the 19th, 26.37;
average, 39.63. On 2d June, 63.45; on 13th, 52-33; average,
57.91. On 4th July, 67.33; on 19th, 56.87; average, 62.04.
On 3d August, 67.83; on 28th, 49.75; average, 59.37. These
six months exhibit the. extremes in the year. The extremes were
applicable only to a few hours in the respective months. The
mean heat of Glasgow was formerly determined by Professor
Thomas Thomson to be 47.75, while that of Edinburgh, as de-
termined by Professor Playfair, was 47.72. But it is presumed
that these eminent philosophers had not the advantage of hour-
ly inspection.
