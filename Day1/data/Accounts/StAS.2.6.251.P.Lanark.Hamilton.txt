ed. About eight or ten miles below Stonebyres, the last fall on
the Clyde, the banks of the river, receding to a more than usual
distance, leave a great extent of plain or level ground. These
low and fertile haughs, chiefly on the west bank of the Clyde, with
the gently sloping ridge behind, constitute the parish of Hamil-
ton. There are a few hundred acres on the east of the Clyde,
which ought of right to belong to the parish of Dalzel.
	Meteorology.--As a general rule, it is observable, that every
300 feet of altitude make a difference of about one degree in tem-
pemture. Thus when the barometer is 29.5 in the lower grounds,
near the town of Hamilton, it is 29.007 on the higher ridge in the
west; which ought to give an elevation of about 500 feet. The
town of Hamilton is upwards of 80 feet above the level of the sea,
--thus we have an elevation of 580 feet. Many neighbouring
ridges are much higher; probably 750 or 800 feet. In these up-
per regions the temperature is generally one or two degrees lower
than in the more sheltered vales in the Clyde, and the harvest is
from a week to a month later. But besides the differences indi-
cated by the thermometer and barometer, there are also very vari-
ous hygrometrical results. After long-continued droughts, the
columns of air being denser and of greater altitude in the vales
than on the heights, buoy up the clouds, till attracted by the lof-
tier ridges on the east and west, their cohesion is dissolved, and
their contents precipitated. In this way the haughs and lower
grounds on the Clyde are often parched with drought, while the
heights on every side are saturated with rain. The qualities of
air contributing to these results, also tend to promote exhalation
in the lower grounds, and to relieve the soil and atmosphere from
the superabundant moisture, so inimical to vegetation in the high-
er parts of the parish. From rain-gages kept here, and in a
neighbouring parish, it appears that the average quantity of rain
for five years was 20.003 inches. The average number of dry
and wet days in each month has also been ascertained from tables
kept for that purpose for ten years. The result is as follows:
