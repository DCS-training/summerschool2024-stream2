entering upon the improvements made in Kincardine moss,
it will be proper to give a short description of that moss, and
of the subjacent soil which is the object of those improve-
ments.
   The moss lies upon a field of clay, which is a continua-
tion of those rich, extensive flats in the neighbourhood of
Falkirk and Stirling, distinguished by the name of carses.
This clay, which is one uniform homogeneous mass, sinking
to a great depth, consists, near the surface, of different co-
lours, and is disposed in layers.  The uppermost is grey;
the next is reddish; and the lowest, which is the most
fertile, is blue.  Through the whole mass not a pebble is
to be found.  The only extraneous bodies it contains are
sea-shells, which occur in all the varieties peculiar to the
eastern coast of Scotland.  They are disposed sometimes in
beds, sometimes scattered irregularly at different depths.  By
attending to these circumstances, it cannot be doubted that
the sea has been the means of the whole accumulation, and
that it was carried on in a gradual manner by the ordinary
ebb and flow of the tide.  Upon any other supposition, why
should there not have been a congeries of all the different
materials that compose the surface of the surrounding heights?
But to whatever cause the origin of this accumulation may be
ascribed, certain it is that no soil is more favourable to vege-
tation, or carries more abundant crops of every kind.
   The surface of the clay, which, upon the retreat of the
sea, had been left in an almost level plane, is every where
thickly covered with trees, chiefly oak and birch, many of
them of a great size.  These trees seem to have been the first
remarkable produce of the carse; and it is probable they
were propagated by dissemination from the surrounding emi-
nences.  They are found lying in all directions beside their
roots, which still continue firm in the ground in their natur-
