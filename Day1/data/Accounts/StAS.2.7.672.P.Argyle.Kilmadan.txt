         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Situation, Soil, &c.-THE most ancient name of this
parish is said to have been Glenduisk, signifying the " Glen of
the Blackwater."  A battle was fought between Meckan, son
of Magnus, King of Norway, and the Albuns or Gails, where
it is said the Norwegians were slaughtered on each side of a
river called Ruail, which runs through the middle of the glen ;
and their bodies being thrown into the river, gave the colour of
blood to it. Hence the parish got the name of Glenderwell, and
the river the name of Ruail, which signifies the "Glen of Red
Blood." Though the epithet red is unnecessary to be added to
blood, yet it is very often done in Gaelic. After the introduction
or Christianity into the country, the place of worship was conse-
crated to St Modan, and called Cella Modani, or Kilmadan.
   The parish is 12 miles long, almost contained in the bottom of
the glen, and a little more than a quarter of a mile broad. It is
bounded by Kilfinnan, Inverchallen, Dunoon,and Strachur. The
parish is almost a flat, bounded by hills, covered mostly with heath.
The air is moist, the soil deep and fertile. The extent of the
sea coast is about three miles. The shore is sandy and flat for
the most part. (Old Statistical Account.)
