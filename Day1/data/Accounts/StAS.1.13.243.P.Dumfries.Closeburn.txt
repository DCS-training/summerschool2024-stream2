   Fuel, Woods.-There is plenty of peat in the parish;
but yet fuel can not easily be procured in sufficient quan-
tities by poor people, who have not the command of hor-
ses.  Coal, though brought 14 miles, is found to be a 
cheaper fire than peat got at the distance of 2 or 3 miles;
yet the poor people place their chief dependence upon 
peat.  The woods in this parish are pretty extensive.  There
are about 200 acres of natural wood, and about 300 acres of
thriving plantations.

   Hills and Game.-The principal hills are Queensberry,
Garrick Heights, and Auchinleck.  From the first of these, 
the Duke of Queensberry takes his title, though only one 
half of it is his property.  Upon the top of this hill, grows 
a small berry, commonly called the Nub Berry.  It bears 
some resemblance to the bramble berry, and is pleasant e-
nough to the taste.  It is not improbable, that the hill 
might derive its name from this berry, which perhaps 
might be called the Queen of Berrys, or Queensberry, as
being though the most delicious of wild berries.  This,
however, is but mere conjecture.  The hill of Queens-
berry rises abouth 2000 feet above the level of the sea,
from which it is distant abouth 20 miles.  The moors in 
this parish used to abound with black-fowl and grouse, and
the low-grounds with partridges:  But of late, all kinds of 
game have become scarce*.

his wages are still higher. 

*The reason commonly assigned for its scarcity, is the too eager desire 
to preserve it.  By the severity of the game-laws, the country people, es-
pecially the shepherds, are deprived of a favourite amusement; and to
