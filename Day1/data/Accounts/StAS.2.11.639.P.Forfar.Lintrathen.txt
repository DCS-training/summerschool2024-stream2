  Agriculture.-The soil in this parish is generally of a deep black
loam, and is under an excellent system of culture. The imple-
ments of husbandary and the work-horses are in general as good as
those that are met with in any part of the county. Owing to the
severity of the winter, wheat is raised in small quantities, but oats
and barley are produced on every farm. Although the average
produce of an acre of these kinds of grain may not be more than
six bolls, yet the quantity of straw is very large in proportion.
This circumstance is of very great advantage to the farmer, for it
enables him to turn his turnips to good account in the fattening of
cattle. Turnips are sown to a considerable extent on every farm.
They thrive uncommonly well. From twenty to thirty cattle
are fed by many farmers in the winter season, and in spring,
when brought to market, they yield, on an average, L. 14 each.
The cattle that are generally selected for stall feeding are of the
black Angus polled breed, and, in most cases, they are reared on
the farm where they are fed. A few beasts of the Teeswater
breed have been tried; but it is not likely that they will come into
general use.
    Therd are about 3000 acres of land under cultivation.

   Husbandary.-The land is generally worked in six divisions:
First year, cutting grass,- two following years, pasture,-fourth
year, oats,-fifth year, turnips or potatoes,-sixth year, oats or
barley.  Draining has been carried on to a considerable extent.
The system that is generally adopted is wedged-draining. Most of
the land is enclosed chiefly with stone fences. Two farms have
hedges.
