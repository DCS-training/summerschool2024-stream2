they contract bad habits.  Hence the Irish sailors are riotous
in Portpatrick, and the Scotch sailors in Donaghadee.  When
at home with their families, they are like other people.  This
might be remedied by a simple alteration-living when they
are from home in their vessels.  I am glad to understand
that the royal packets are adopting this mode.
   I cannot here avoid adding, that if any of our people do
get into bad habits, they owe it, more than to any other
cause, to the cheapness of whisky.  The quantity brought
here is amazing.  If a stop is not soon put to this fatal drug,
it must in a short time alter the species.

   Robbery.-I cannot say if this be of sufficient importance
to form an article.  I can only tell you that dispute fre-
quently arise between travellers and them; and that, bad as
they are, these disputes often happen from transfers not com-
prehending perfectly the nature of the establishment.  The
present Marquis of Downshire had a difference with them
which induced him to leave the ferry for some years.

   School, Schoolmaster.-We have a school here without a
schoolhouse, and a schoolmaster with a salary of a hundred
merks.  The number of scholars, when the school is at the
best, is about forty.  We hope soon, as our improvements
proceed, to get a proper house built for a school, with a pro-
per salary appended.  The late Sir James Hunter Blair gave
us a temporary house for a school, and also raised the sala-
ry; but, from circumstances not imputable to any body, it
has fallen back again.

vessels belonging to this port."
