         		     PARISH OF SKENE.

                PRESBYTERY OF ADERDEEN, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                   THE, REV. GEORGE MACKENZIE, MINISTER.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
         Name.-THE name of the parish is said to be derived from the
Gaelic sgian, (or shian), "the dagger, or knife," that weapon having
been used by the man who killed a wild boar which had attacked
King Malcolm (Canmore) whilst hunting within the bounds of the
parish, then supposed to be part of the King's forest. For which
service, the same tradition says, the young Highlander, was re-
warded by a grant of the whole land in the parish.*
        Extent, &c.-The extent of the parish is nearly 6 miles by 4.
It is bounded by the parishes of Kinellar, Newbills, Peterculter,
Echt, Cluny, Kemnay, and Kintore.
         Hydrography.-The Loch of Skene is nearly three miles in
circumference, situated near the west boundary of the parish. Its
greatest depth does not exceed twelve feet. It is supplied by se-
veral small streams, and is the reservoir which supplies water for
one of the meal mills in the parish, and for the works of Messrs
Hadden and Sons (a wool manufactory) at Garlogie mills.
         Geology.-The soil is various, from the undulating nature of
the grounds in the parish; several of the ridges (although they
can scarcely be called hills) rising to a considerable height, and,
with two excepted, which are planted, cultivated to the tops.
There are some rich and fertile fields; but few comparatively;
the greater part of the land being either light or cold. The sub-
soil is chiefly clay, part sand or gravel, and there is a considerable
extent of moss.
	There has been a great improvement, by means, of plantation,
since the time of the last Statistical Account. Almost every he-

flight. The latter was preferred.
