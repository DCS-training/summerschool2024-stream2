   Valued Rent-already stated in the original report.
   Real Rent.-This may have increased by an addition of
from 150 L. to 200 L. per annum; exclusive of coal and lime:
which two last articles may have risen in rent about as much;
and that not merely from the increased demand for lime, as
an improvement of the lands; but from the increasing de-
mand for coal as fuel; the farmers engaged in their agri-
culture, finding it more inconvenient than formerly, to spare
the time and labour of their servants and horses in prepar-
ing fuel from the peat mosses.
   Few farms have fallen out of lease since the date of the
Report: Such as have, are raised by the addition of probably
two-thirds of the former rent.  The leases were formerly of
nineteen years endurance; the rents all in money, excepting
in some instances, a few poultry or carriages of fuel.  The
above statement applies generally through the county.
   Those skilled in political arithmetic can best judge how
far these rises in rent are merely nominal, being proportion-
ed merely to the depreciation of money; and how far they
are real and attributable to the increase both of agricultural
capital and skill, by which the lands are rendered really more
productive.
   Taxation-(speaking merely of permanent taxation, and
not of the war taxes) though increased, may, to a certain
proportion of its extent, prove thus to be merely nominal:
In so say as it is real, does it equal or exceed, or come short
of the real increase of wealth; and the consequent ability to
bear it?
   Stipend, Glebe, etc.-The stipend has received no augmen-
