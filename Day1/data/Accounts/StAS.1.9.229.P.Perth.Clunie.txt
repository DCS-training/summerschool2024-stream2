W. and N. W. winds are peculiarly agreeable and advan-
tageous here in autumn.  In that chearful laborious season,
our anxious husbandman throws a wishful look to the N.
W. and pointing to some well known summit of the Gram-
plan mountains, raises his heart and his hand to heaven, and
prays that the wind may never shift from that particular
quarter, till his own and his neighbour's fields are cleared.
There are here no local diseases.  Colds and sore throats
are pretty frequent in winter.  The ague is unknown, and
the gout and rheumatism occur very rarely.  The measles

friendly intentions, visit the patient; but who, without ob-
serving the proper caution, rush upon his breath, imbibe
the contagion, and communicate it from house to house,
and from village to village.  This conduct is to be ascribed
partly to ignorance, and partly to a religious prejudice, both
of which are happily giving place to more sensible and en-

the N. W. part of the parish, is the highest mountain.  It
stands on an elevated basis, and, commands a very extensive
prospect.  From the top of Ben-achally, in a clear day, you
