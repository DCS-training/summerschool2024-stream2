2 L. for the same period.  Every considerable farmer keeps
also at least one cottar or yearly man with his family, to
whom he gives a house and yard, meal and potatoes, or other
emoluments, to the amount of 15 L. or 20 L.  Of this last
description, the greater part are Irishmen, escaped from their
country and their loom, and are commonly good hands with
a spade or flail, but not dexterous in the management of
horses at the cart, or the plough.
   The horses, of which there are about 280 in the parish,
are mostly all of the draught kind, or are used for that pur-
pose, and are partly bred here, and partly imported from
Ireland.  About 15 and 16 hands is their usual height, and
as many pounds their price.  Unless in very stiff, or uncul-
tivated lands, seldom more than two are put to a plough,
and never more than one to a cart.  The use of tracers, as
they are called, still so prevalent in many parts of Galloway,
is totally exploded in Mochrum, because, it is believed, that
two horses, put each to a cart, will do at least one third more
work, and with greater ease, than when yoked together in
one.  It is worthy of notice, that 20 years ago, there was
only one cart in the parish belonging to a tenant, whereas
there are now 170 of that description.
   The Scotch plough, improved, or the chain one, are
chiefly used.  The latter is preferred where the land is not
stony, being easier drawn.  The ploughman always drives
the horses for himself, when not more than two, and some-
times even three, when yoked abreast.  The farmers begin
to plow in November, and finish by the end of February,
when the seeds are sown, which are commonly all in the
ground in the course of five weeks after, if the season has
been favourable.
   The horses are generally fed with straw, and two seeds of
oats a-day, when they plow; and with rye-grass, and three
seeds, when they harrow the ground.
