In 1839-40, lectures on Natural History were delivered. It has
a library of about 6OO volumes. There are two public reading-
rooms for newspapers. There is at present no periodical work
published here, although there are two printing establishments.
  Charitable Institution.--The only one is an hospital for the
maintenance of four acred persons. It was founded and endowed
in 1640, by Lord Livingstone of Almond and Callendar. There
belongs to it an acre of ground near the town, which is let for
gardens, &c. Each of the inmates receives from the proprietor
of Callendar ten firlots of oatmeal annually, besides a small sum
in money. He has the right of filling up vacancies as thdy occur.
  There are several private associations for the support of the
sick, the infirm, and the aged. There was a savings' bank some
years ago but it does not now exist.
  Poor and parochial Funds.--In 1833, the poor's roll contained
160 persons. At present (1840), they amount to 250. All
these receive regular supply, according to their circumstances of
destitution, from Is. 6d. to 16s. per month. Another class receive
3s. and 4s. per week. Besides these, sums to a large annual
amount are bestowed in occasional relief In the winter season,
shoes and clothing are given in addition to pecuniary donations.
In the course of the year ending June 1839, L.693, 14s. 3d. were
expended in these different ways. The funds requisite for these
supplies arise from the interest of L.600 lent out by the kirk-ses-
sion about fifty years ago, dues of proclamations, mortcloth, col-
lections at the door of the parish church, but chiefly from an as-
sessment imposed annually by a meeting of the heritors and kirk-
session in terms of law. This assessment for many years consisted
of L.1 Sterling on every L.100 Scots of valued rent in the parish,
and, along with a voluntary contribution from the inhabitants of
the town and villages, amounted to L.200. This, in addition to
the other funds, formed an adequate source of supply for the poor
and incidental expenses. Of late years however, the assessment
has been rapidly increasing. In 1834-35, it was L.400; 1835--36,
L.65o; 1836-37, L.550; and, in 1837-38, L.950. The average
collection at the church door for five years preceding June 1839,
is about L.65. These contributions are decreasing to a great
extent, in consequence of the enlarged assessments. A committee
of heritom meets with the kirk-session  monthly, for receiving ap-
plications for aid; and from the numbers who: then apply, the re-
qeption of parochial relief does not appear to them to be degrading.
A great defect prevails. as to the proper management of the poor.
