     Statistical Account

   It has been observed that limestone is always found in the
same field with the coat; it is in general a seam from three
feet to five in thickness, and is wrought in the following man-
ner: They take off the earth from the surface, called tirring,
which is from 10 to 30 feet; seldom or never have they as
yet wrought the lime-stone by mining.  The probability is,
however, that they will soon be compelled to it; the work-
men take tirring at 3 d. the square yard; they put out the
lime-stone at so much per chalder, and by experience they
know what number of square yards of broken stone, makes a

might be saved, which are unfortunately lost by the workmen striking through
upon old waste; as was the case February 1789, when five coalliers were kil-
led in the Newk coal pit of Campsie.  I consider the wages of the coalIiers,
as by no means in proportion to the wages of other labourers in the parish;
the labourer having only sixteen pence per day:  Allowing the coallier a third
more on account of the danger and disagreeable nature of the work, viz. two
shillings, then there would be one third of the wages, which he receives at
present, saved to the public.
   Coal, in every inland district in Scotland, should not be considered as an
article of commerce, which the landlord as a merchant, may speculate upon
for his own advantage:  It should be considered as an article of the first ne-
cessity:  Proprietors of land should recollect, that every circumstance which
increases population, ultimately benefits their estates; wherever water is plen-
ty and firing cheap, there the manufacturer and labourer will always resort.
Campsie, at present, is conspicuously blessed with both; and it will discover
the solly of the landlords, if ever they permit coals to become much dearer;
it is not the richness of the soil which always brings the highest rent to the
proprietor: some particular local advantage acts in his favour; and perhaps
there is none to surpass the advantage of cheap fuel.
   A small farmer (such as we have in this district) considers good oat meal
and a good fire as great luxuries; and while the tenants possess these, they will
make a considetable shift to pay their dear rents.
   It is with pleasure that we take notice of the public spirited attempts made
by several gentlemen last year, to prevent the coals from rising in this district;
and they have fully succeeded:  They have perhaps sunk a little money, but
their tenants and dependants have reaped the benefit, and the public hath paid
them every respect which an elevated mind can desire.
