	which much benefit has been derived by the aged and infirm, as
	well as by widows and orphans. Allowances are also made for de-
	fraying the funeral expenses of members and their widows. The
	Castletown Society alone, since its commencement in 1797, has
	distributed nearly L.4000. These Societies have prevented many
	from being on the poor's roll.
	   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
	receiving parochial aid is 35, whose circumstances are taken into
	due consideration without any special or fixed sum being allotted.
	There is a mortification of L.100, left by the late Dr Oswald of
	Scotstown, the interest of which, along with L.525 of collections,
	and some seat-rents in the church, under the direction of the ses-
	tion, placed at their disposal last year L.36, 12s. 4d. There is
	no assessment of the heritors. Particular care is taken in the ad-
	mission of parties on the poor roll-vagrancy is discouraged-no
	pauper certificate for begging has been granted during the last
	fifteen years-and in various cases, the heritors and parishioners
	have subscribed liberally, in order to pre-vent families from be-
	coming a permanent burden upon the parish.
	   Fairs.-There are three annual fairs held in the parish; in
	March, June and November, for the sale and purchase of cattle.
	   Inns.-There are two in the parish, which are well kept, but
	one would be fully sufficient for the accommodation required by
	travellers.
	   Fuel.-Moss is not very abundant in this parish; but there is
	now an abundant supply of English coal to be had at the village
	of Castletown: it is conveyed, in vessels that are constantly ar-
	riving at Castlehill for cargoes of pavement.
