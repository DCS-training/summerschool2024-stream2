with two pecks of meal a week.  Sometimes, is he is better
than the ordinary run of servants, he will, in addition to the

   We generally get our labourers, that is to say, dykers and
ditchers, from the north, and a few can be had in the parish.
They will earn from 1 s. to 2 s. 6 d. a day.  There is one'
mason, with two apprentices, in the parish; five or six wea-
vers; no shoemakers regularly bred.  The common people
make their own shoes.  There are three or four brogue-
makers, three house-carpenters, seven taylors, and one black-
smith.

   Ruins.-At the east end of Eoch-laggan stand the remains
of an old church dedicated to St Kenneth.  The greatest
part of the walls of that venerable edisice are still standing.
It is surrounded by a consecrated burying ground, which is
still more used than any other.  In the middle of the 
Coill More, a great wood on the south side of the loch,
is a place called Arst Merigie, or the height on which
a standard was wont to be erected.  Here is a place held fa-
cred by the most remote antiquity, and said to be the burial-
place of seven kings of the antient Caledonians.  It should
appear, from popular tradition, that those kings, or eminent
warriors, lived about the period when the Scots were driven
by the Picts beyond the Tay, and had their scat of govern-
ment at Dunkeld.  It likewise appears, that of old this was
a famous place for hunting; and indeed it continued to a-
bound in deer and roes till very lately, that the introduction
of sheep, with which these animald never mingle, has driven
them away. It is said that the kings came always, with their
retinue and hounds, to hunt, for the most part of the sum-
mer, on the blanks of this loch, and in the neighbourhood.
