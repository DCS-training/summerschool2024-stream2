PARISH OF DORNOCH. SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND

CAITHNESS.

THE REV. ANGUS KENNEDY, MINISTER.

I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATIURAL HISTORY.
Name.-"THE town and parish of Dornoch," says the writer of
the last Statistical Account, " derive their name from the Gaelic
words Dorn-Eich, which signify a horse's foot or hoof,-there be-
ing a current tradition to this effect:-About the year 1259, the
Danes and Norwegians having made a descent on this coas4 were
attacked by William, Thane or Earl of Sutherland, a quarter of
a mile to the eastward of this-town. Here the Danish general was
slain, and his army beaten, and forced to retire to their ships,
which were not far distant. The Earl of Sutherland greatly
signalized himself upon this occasion; and appears, by his personal
valour and exertion, to have contributed very much to determine
the fate of the, day. While he singled out the Danish general,
and gallantly fought his way onward, the Thane, being by some
accident disarmed, seized the leg of a horse which lay on the ground,
and with that despatched his adversary. In honour of this exploit,
and of the weapon with which it was achieved, this place received
the name of Dorneich, or Dornoch, as.it is now called. This tra-
dition is countenanced b the horse-shoe, which is still retained in
the arms of the burgh.
Extent and Boundaries.-This parish extends in breadth 9 miles
from E. to W. along the coast of the Frith of Dornoch; and in
length from S. to N. or N. W. about 15 miles. It is bounded
on the east by the Little Ferry, which separates it from the pa-
rish of Golspie; on the north and west by the parishes of Ro-
gart and Criech; and on the south by the Dornoch Frith, which
separates it from the county of Ross.
The parish may be considered as a sort of peninsula; the Dor-
noch Frith, which extends considerably beyond it, bounding it on
the south, and the estuary of the Little Perry on the east, which
