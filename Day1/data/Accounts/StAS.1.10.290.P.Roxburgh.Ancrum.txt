and discharges itself into Tiviot at the distance of half a mile
below the village, and a quarter of a mile above Ancrum
Bridge on the great road to Jedburgh.  This river abounds
with excellent trout, and affords better sport to the fishers
than any other in this country.

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-The soil, in the lower grounds of
the parish upon the side of Tiviot, is rich, consisting of a
mixture of sand and clay, and, in some places, particularly
near the village, of a loam.  In every season it produces good
crops of wheat, barley, potatoes, turnips, and sown grass.
On the higher ground or ridge, which pervades the parish
from E. to W. and, on the declivities exposed to the N. the
surface is a heath, wet, partially stony, covering a bottom of
cold clay; but the flat ground, on both the Ancrum and
Langnewton side of Ale, is naturally rich, though, being of a
deep and stiff clay, it is not so easily ploughed, nor are the
returns so certain, as in the Tiviot haughs or holmes.
   There was formerly a considerable extent of wood in this
parish; but none of long standing remains, except upon the
banks of the Ale near the village of Ancrum, and that which
is in the environs of Ancrum-house, on the opposite side of
the river.  There are several young plantations of fir and
white wood belonging to Sir John Scott, Admiral Elliot, etc.
and some, comprehending not less than 100 acres, upon the
estate of Sir George Douglas, in the barony of Langnewton.
These are all thriving; and already begin to embellish the
aspect of the country, which was formerly bleak and desolate.
   The situation of Ancrum-house, where, according to tra-

tive.  The surrounding fields are beautifully diversified both
in figure and surface.  Spots of verdant lawn, sometimes le-
vel and sometimes sloping, craggy knolls, scattered trees, and
