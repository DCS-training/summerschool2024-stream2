or four years, and even longer, if the return was a little
more than two seeds; after that, fallow, without any kind
of manure; then two crops of oats, and fallow again every
third year, as long as it would produce a decent crop; then
allowed to go to pasture.
   The present mode followed in the parish:-The light
land first well prepared for turnip, which are sown in drills
neatly made up, manured with the dung of the farm, and
lime or shell marl, so far as they can be procured, not to
lose the season for the turnip; part of which is eat on the
ground with sheep, and part with cattle in the house.  When
eat with sheep, it is not uncommon to sow wheat with
grass-seeds, which, in general, succeeds well.  When the
turnip is carried off, barley with grass-seeds seldom fails of
a good crop; then hay is taken, the fog, or second crop,
eat on the ground with various kinds of stock; then, in
autumn, taken up for wheat, which is sown with one fur-
row; after the wheat, oats, and then turnip; sometimes
they take up with oats, and hen turnip; when the land is
naturally very good, and in high order, wheat is taken
after the oats, then turnip:  After this rotation is followed
twice, the grass is allowed to lie for pasture two or three
years, then taken up as before.  The land that is too heavy
for turnip, or the clay lands, are taken up from grass with
oats; then fallow with the dung of the farm, and a full
dressing of shell marl or lime (25 double carts of marl, or
6 double carts of lime per English acre) sown with wheat;
then pease, then barley with grass-seeds, then hay, and
after that three years pastured; then cropped as before.

   Grass-seeds.-When 'only one crop is taken, they sow
12 lb. of red clover, and half a bushel rye-grass, to the Eng-
lish acre; when to lay in pasture, 6 lb. of white clover,
