   Tertian Class.-After a brief recapitulation of the subjects
of the former year, the professor proceeds in the third year
to dialling, conic sections, and fluxions: exercises in the last
are continued through the remainder of the course.  Experi-
mental philosophy in its several branches, mechanics, hydro-

work, all arts and sciences, and be founded on an analysis
and natural history of the intellectual faculties.  Every illus-
