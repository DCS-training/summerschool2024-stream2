can they make bread by it themselves, owing to the high
price of leather.
   The imports into this parish, consist of salt, iron, hemp,
coarse cloths, whisky, a few grocery goods, and coals.  The
repeal of the duty on coals, will be an immense benefit in
future years, as there are few peats to be got, and wood fells
too high for feuel.
   The exports consist of grain, cattle, herrings, and the manu-
factures formerly mentioned.  Besides supplying its own in-
habitants, this parish disposes of yearly to the neighbouring
distillers, and the burghs of Fortrose and Inverness, from 800
to 1000 bolls bear, and from 200 to 400 bolls of oats, peace,
and meal, including what is sent forth of the victual rents.
Though the last crops (1792) was deficient in counties far-
ther South, it was so plentiful in general throughout the
Eastern half of Ross-shire and Cromarty, that, after serving
the people and the numerous stills, those districts have ex-
ported six or seven thousand bolls.

   Population.-If we may judge from concurring traditions,
where no authentic record has been preserved; and from a
well known fall, that there are a third more dwelling houses
now in the parish of Avoch, than in the beginning of this
century, the population must have increased considerably
within that period ú Yet, by Dr Webster's list in 1755, the
population is stated at 1457; and by an accurate survey made
partly in 1792, and concluded spring 1793, the number of
living souls was found to be 1380.
   The church, which was built in 1670, and was probably
made sufficient to accomodate the parishioners, or at least
such a number of them as might be expected to attend pub-
lic worship regularly about that time, could not, in the way
it was then sitted up, contain properly above 400 persons.
