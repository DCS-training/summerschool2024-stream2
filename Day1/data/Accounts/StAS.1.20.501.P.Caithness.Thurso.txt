various parts of Scotland, resort to this fair, with goods to a
large amount.  It is also a market for horses, butter, cheese,
linen-cloth, and yarn, and other commodities of the growth,
produce, and manufacture, of the country.  But, of late
years, since the merchants in the town have extended their
trade, and enlarged their shops, and increased the number
of articles they deal in, this market has not been so much
frequented by strangers as formerly.

   SECT. II. Corporation and Magistrates.-The town was
formerly governed by three bailies, and twelve counsellors,
appointed by the superior; but, for many years past, the
magistracy has been confined to two bailies and twelve
counsellors.  These are not elected annually, but continue in
office during the superior's pleasure.  Perhaps it were bet-
ter, that the magistrates were annually nominated by the
superior, from a leet presented to him by the burgesses and
inhabitants; at any rate, in terms of the charter, the num-
ber of bailies ought to be increased to three.

   SECT. III.  Armorial Bearings.-There are none ex-
tant; but there is a town's seal, which is a St Andrew with
his cross.

   SECT. IV.  Taxes and Revenues.-The town is valued in
the cess-books of the county, at L. 666:  13:  4 Scotch mo-
ney; and the feuars pay a proportional part of the land-
tax, corresponding to that valuation.  They also pay cer-
tain feu-duties to the superior, chiefly in tallow.  These,
with the public taxes, are all that the inhabitants are sub-
jected to.  As a corporation, the town has not revenue.
The customs of the public markets and fairs, are let for a
small yearly rent, which belongs to the superior.
