facts and circumstances, to ascribe them to the smallness
of the farms, and to the short leases usually granted by
the landlords.  This, however, would be a rash, perhaps
an erroneous decision.  The want of stock at setting up a
farm, or being obliged to sell off cattle for payment of 
rent, disqualifies a man from doing justice to his land;
and one with 5 of 6 acres of land, has frequently a bet-
ter corn-yard than another in the same field with 8 or 9
acres.  That the longest leases in the present circumstan-
ces of the country, would be of little consequence, with 
regard to improvements, may be admitted, in a place
where proprietors of farms, and which have been in their
families for several generations, observe the same mode
of husbandry, and are neither better lodged, clothed, and
fed, than the tenants in the neighbourhood.  Their feu-
duties, to be sure, are heavy.  Their farms, perhaps,
have been feued at the actual rent, when the feus were
granted.  But the rents of neighbouring farms have, in 
some instances, been doubled; and yet the tenants live
as well as the generality of these petty proprietors.  Good
grass is much wanted.  All the cattle, except the milch-
cows, are turned out to the hills and moors, where
they make a shift to preserve life, but are stinted in their
growth; and the queys are often 5 or 6 years old before
they have a calf.  But there can be no grass sown where
there are neither enclosures nor proper herding; and to
leave land out of tillage, which has been constant tillage
for ages, produces only weeds.  Besides the numbers of small
swine that run are large from the time the corns are taken
in till the bear-feed for the ensuing crop be sown, root
up every grass that might grow.
   Poughing after harvest is very unusual.  Small as the
farms are, this occations a throng of work in the spring-
