   Ecclesiastical State.-Before the Reformation there was a men-
sal church here under the bishoprick of Dunkeld, with two altars;
the one dedicated to St Columba, the patron saint of that see,
and the other to the Virgin Mary. Both that church, indeed,
and half of the manor of Cramond, bad by David I. been granted
to Robert Avenel, and subsequently transferred by him to the
Bishops of Dunkeld. In 1210 Richard de Prebenda died while
residing here, and was buried in the monastery of Inchcolm.*
   The present church was built in the year 1656. + In form it
resembles a cross. It was greatly enlarged in 1811, and is now
capable of containing 958 sitters.
   The manse was built in 1745. In consequence of the alte-
rations and improvements which have been made upon it from time
to time since then, it is now a very comfortable and commodious
dwelling. The situation of the church and manse has been much
and justly admired. Viewed from the road leading down to the
village, at the distance of a few hundred yards, they present a
landscape remarkably beautiful and attractive;-the manse stand-
ing on the foreground,-the church, with its antique tower, peep-
ing from an enclosure of lofty planes, while trees of magnificent
beauty fill the eye on every side, and complete the picture.

<FOOTNOTE>It may be viewed, says Dr Jamieson, as a farther proof of the great attachment
still retained to Columba at Dunkeld, that so many bishops, most probably at their own
desire, were interred in that island which bore his name, as having been consecrated
to bird. This is the island called Inchcolm, or St Columba's Inch."-Jamieson's
Hist. of Culdees, p. 144.
          The bell of the tower, inscribed with "Michael Burghersdyk fecit me 1619,
-Soli Deo Gloria, "-was restored, from the body of civil war, by Monk in 1658.
