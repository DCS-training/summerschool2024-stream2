   Villages.-The village of Kippen stands about a mile dis-
tant from the eastern boundary of the parish, and contains
76 families.  Buchlyvie, which is 5 miles farther west, is a
larger village, and contains 102 families.  The greater part
of the inhabitants of both these villages consists of labourers
and trades people of different descriptions.  There are several
merchants also, who supply us not only with rye grass, clover,
lint seed, and wool, but with most articles of personal and
domestic consumpt.

   Fairs and Markets.-Five fairs are held in the village of
Kippen, and as many in Buchlyvie in the course of the year.
Besides which, there is a weekly market in Kippen, in each
Wednesday, for 3 or 4 weeks, in the month of December.
