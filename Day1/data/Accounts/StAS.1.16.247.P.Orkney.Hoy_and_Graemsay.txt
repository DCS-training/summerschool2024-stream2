to feed upon sea-weeds or ware, they are often carried away
by the high tides that commonly take place in stormy
weather.  As to the number of their sheep, it would be no easy
matter to ascertain, as the people are at great care and
pains to conceal it; but by a general calculation they may
be computed at 1000 or 1200.

   Productions.-The quantity of grain produced here is
very inconsiderable, and their farms are so very small,
that when they have paid their rents to their landlords,
which are collected commonly in kind, they have but a

butter.  The prices of these articles are very precarious,
