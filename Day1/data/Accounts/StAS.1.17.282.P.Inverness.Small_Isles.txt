     Statistical Account

that the island of Eigg, which was formerly in part rented by
small tenants, was divided among 8 principal tacksmen.

   Stones.-In various parts of the coast of Eigg, there are
bodies of free stone, some of it too soft, and some of it suffi-
ciently solid to bear the chissel; but hitherto it has been
converted to no useful purpose that I know.  On the N. W.
side of the island, there is also a body of shelly limestone,
yielding fine lime, and not difficult to burn; this, if fuel
were plentiful, might afford excellent manure.  In Rum,
there is a kind of light red rock, which has an affinity to ve-

very fit for rough building.  In one particular spot, it is
found in pretty thin flags, not difficult to quarry, some of
them about 5 feet square; some of them have been squared
with the hammer, and floors paved with them to very good
purpose.  In this island, also, crystalline and pebble stones,
not large in size, but of great solidity, are found.  Glass has
been cut by some of the crystas.  The pebbles are of various
colours, and admit of a very fine polish.

   Inundations.-On the north side of Rum there is a rivulet,
taking its rise in some of the highest mountains, which has
often overflowed its banks, and, spreading over the valley
through which it runs, done considerable damage to the
growing corn, and swept along some of the peats cut in the
neighbourhood.

   Language.-The language, principally spoken, and univer-
sally understood, is Gaelic, and from it the names of places
seem mostly to be derived; yet it must be confessed, that
there are names of places, which the present inhabitants do
not fully understand, that seem to be derived from a lan-
