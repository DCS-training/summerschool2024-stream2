are very averse to perform statute labour upon them, and
their superiors give themselves little trouble about the matter.
Nor are there any bridges, except some wooden ones for foot
passengers.  Hence it is that every thing must be carried on
horseback.

   Antiquities.-There are traces of encampments, with ma-
ny tumuli, and remains of Pictish buildings almost every
where.

   General Character.-The people seem to be much more in-
clined to idleness than to industry.  They are extremely frugal
of the little they have; but as to earning any thing more, it is
a melancholy fact, that a poor tenant, who rents land only
to the value of 20 s. or 30 s. and whose labour could well be
spared from his little farm many days in the year, will rather
saunter, or sit idle at home, than work for 6 d. a day, which
would be a considerable addition to his own and his family's
scanty meal.  Such being the general character of the peo-
ple, it is almost needless to add, that the evils attending idle-
ness and poverty are too common amongst them.  They are,
however, in general, religious and well disposed, and may be-
come industrious, when they have more tempting induce-
ments to become so.-They all speak the Gaelic language.
Such as understand English at all, speak it grammatically,
though with the accent peculiar to most of the Northern
Highlanders.
