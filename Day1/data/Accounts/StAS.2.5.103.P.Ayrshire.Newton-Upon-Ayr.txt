there is a lack of the means of education; and one or two additional
endowed schools are much required.
	Library.--A parochial library was instituted in 1829, and contains
about 500 volumes. The annual subscription is 2s., and the num-
ber of readers varies from 60 to 100.
	Friendly Socities.--Of these there are only two, which can be
considered us belonging to this parish, and they are not in a pros-
perous state. But there are 10 or 12 societies whose members
are scattered through Ayr, Newton. and Wallacetown; and since
1790, they have distributed among their sick and infirm members
L. 13,643.
	Savings Bank.--A savings bank was instituted in 1815 for the
parishes of Ayr, Newton, and St Quivox. The sums invested
yearly have since its commencement gradually increased. Last
year they amounted to L. 2715--the sums withdrawn to L. 2375.
In the course of the last two years 503 accounts have been opened
for new depositors, about one-fourth of whom reside in this parish.
The depositors in general belong to the various classes of mecha-
nics,--weavers, mason, shoemakers, carpenters, &c.--and a very
considerable proportion are females, employed ate needle-work, or
as domestic servants.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The following table shows the ave-
rage number of persons who have received parochial aid for the
last seven years, the annual amount of contributions for their re-
lief, and the correspomding outlay:

	Besiede the monthly pensioners, whose allowance varies from
Is. 6d. to 8s. per months, and may be averaged at 4s. 6d., there are
many who receive occasional aid. The funds for the support of
the poor are raised by church collections, ammounting to about
L. 100 yearly, and by an assessment is obtained from occasional
L. 50. A little additional assistance is obtained from income.
It will be observed that, for some years past, the income has been
exceeded by the expenditure. To remove  the debt, which is thus
accumulating, it is proposed to increase the assessment; but it is
