   The wool is in general coarse, the carcase being principally
attended to.  Upon an average it takes about 12 fleeces to the
stone, which fells at from 10 s. to 12 s.  Little or no attention
is given to have sheep with fine wool, though there are some
in the district.
   To the north of the Stinchiar, and along the shore, there is a
great deal of land fit for fattening both sheep and black cattle, and
to that use several farmers appropriate their ground.  But the
breeding of cattle is a more general object in this part of the 
country.  It is supposed, that nearly one fifth part of the pa-
rish is arable land, or capable of being made so.  Agriculture,
however, has been less attended to, as within these twenty or

than doubled, whereas the value of corn has continued nearly
the same.  Such encouragement also is given to importation
of Irish grain, as tends greatly to depress the husbandry of this
neighbourhood.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 5945 Scots; the
real about L. 3000 sterling.  Within these twenty years past,
the rent has been doubled, almost universally, and in some

village of Colmonell, paid, twenty years ago, L. 25 sterling.
The possessor, at the expiry of his lease, went out a beggar.
It was let on a new lease at L. 80 sterling, and is evidently now
a lucrative bargain.  It was too large for the former tenant to
manage with propriety.  His successor made several subsetts,
but reserved to himself a good portion of the land, with a ve-
ry small share of the rent.  All his subtenants have made mo-
