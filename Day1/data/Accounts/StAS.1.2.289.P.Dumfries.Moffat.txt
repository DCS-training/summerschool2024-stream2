trisle of 3000 feet higher, than the village of Moffat, which
may be 300 feet, or more, above the level of the sea.  There
is a large and beautiful plain, upon the top of Hartfell, of ex-
tent enough for a horse race.  The prospect on a clear day is im-
mense:  Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Northumberland, are
seen on the south; the ocean, both on the east and west, and,
to the north, the view is terminated by the Highland hills.
There is a spring well near the top of the mountain.  The
spring, called Hartfell Spaw, issues from the foot of it.
   Most of the hills in the parish are very high, though they
all fall short of Hartfell.  They are mostly green, with very
little heath:  Some of them much broken with rocks.  One
hill, called the Yoke, is so narrow at the top, that a person
can fit with a leg on each side of it, as upon a saddle, and see
to the bottom on both sides, where two beautiful rivulets
flow.

   Mines and Minerals-No mines have been discovered in
the parish, though some slight trials have been made.  Coals
are brought from Douglas; a few from Sanquhar; both dis-
tant near 30 miles.  Fuel is consequently dear at Moffat; sel-
dom, even in summer, can coals be bought, under 10 d. the
hundred weight; and, in the winter season, they cost from
1 s. to 16, or 18 d.
   Peats or turs are brought 4 or 5 miles, and sold at 2 s. the
single cart load in summer, and, in winter, at 2 s 6 d.  They
are generally very good; and yet, dear as coal is, it is thought
the cheapest fire of the two.
   It is said, that there is a considerable body of allum
rock in the parish; but no trial has been made of it.  Indeed its
mountainous situation, and its distance from fuel, and from
the sea, would render if of little no value.
   There is a species of clay, which the smiths use for fixing
