   It was long doubted whether iron made with raw bituminous
coal and heated air would answer for malleable iron.  Several ex-
periments have lately been made to this effect, which have been
attended with the most satisfactory results,  Messrs Beecroft,
Butler, and Co., at their works at Kirkstall, near Leeds, lately
found that 4 cwt. 2 qrs. of Scotch pig iron yielded by the process
of boiling instead of puddling, blooms of 4 cwt. 1 qr. 8 lbs. each,
showing only the comparative trifling waste of 20 lbs. in a charge
of 4 cwt. 2 qrs., and the quality of iron was found to be equal at
least to any made from cold air.
   The castings take place at these workr every twelve hours-
The iron obtained is generally a mixture of No. 1 and No. 2.
The average produce of the raw ironstone varies from 22 to 34
per cent.; when calcined it varies from 40 to 50 per cent.; the
average is 44, at from 8s. 6d. to 9s. per ton. On an average, the
manufacture of a ton of pig iron requires 4856 lbs. of coal, or 2, tons
8 1/2 cwt.  The hot air apparatus consumes about 8 cwt. to a ton, which,
raises the total quantity to 2 tons 16 1/2 cwts., or about 2 3/4 tons to the
ton of pig iron.  Each furnace is fully charged twice in the twenty-
four hours.  Each single charge, at an average, requires about 660
lbs. of coal, 520 lbs. of calcined iron ore, and 100 lbs. of lime-
stone; i. e. 154 such charges produce about 17 tons 15 cwt. or 18
tons 17 cwt. in twenty-four hours.  As ordinary tuyers would not
resist the high temperature to which they are exposed, water tuyers
have been substituted similar to those used in refineries. The
temperature at the place where the tuyer enters the: furnace is a
brilliant white heat, and the flame which escapes from the tunnel-
head is of a bright red, whilst that of the old furnaces supplied by
coke and blown with cold air is of a yellowish hue.  The pressure
of the blast upon the iron receiver is, on an average, about 2 1/2 lbs.
According to the dimensions of the blowing cylinder, the quantity
of blast was formerly 2827 cubic feet per minute for each furnace
when blown by cold air, and is now only 2120 cubic feet.  The
following tables will prove interesting:
