     NUMBER. XIX.

     PARISH OF PERTH.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH,-PRESBYTERY OF PERTH,-SY-
     NOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING,-COMMISSARIOT
     OF St. ANDREWS.)

     BY the Rev. Mr JAMES SCOTT.

     SS 1. Name of the Town.

   THE town of Perth gives its name, not only to the parish,
but also to the extensive county in which it is situated.
The late Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, (Annals of
Scotland, Vol. ii. p.  341.) says, "The derivation of the
"word Perth, used in vol. i. p. 138, ought to be omitted.
"I have been favoured with different interpretations of the
"word.  Not knowing which to chuse, I judge it best to
"omit them all."
   In this Statistical Account, however, some explanation of
the name may be expected.
   The word Perth, is pronounced by the Highlanders, Peirt
or Peart.  According to this pronunciation, the word is said
by some persons to mean a finished labour, or complete piece
of work; and to refer to the building of the town, or to the
fortifications with which it was originally surrounded.
