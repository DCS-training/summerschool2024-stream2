tom of the river is rocky.  This, in large floods, forms
the most beautiful cascades of broken water.  There is a
bridge of two arches built across the river, a little south of
the church and manse, where the river is narrow, upon a
rocky foundation.  The falls of the river to a person stand-
ing upon this bridge in a large flood produce a grand and
awful sensation.  Here we behold a train of the most
beautiful cascades of broken water, tearing and roaring,
over the rugged rocks, with the most tremendous noise.
About 20 yards below the bridge, there is one of the
grandest falls of water to be seen in the south of Scotland.
Indeed, travellers who have seen it in a great flood, have
averred, that it is equal, if not superior, to many of the
remarkable falls of water in the Highlands.  Here the
river runs over a ridge of rock actors the bottom, and
falls into a deep lin.  It is so remarkable an object in na-
ture, that it has called forth the attention of the Scottish
Muse, in the ancient poem of the Cherry and the Slae, com-
posed by Captain Montgomery, who lived in the neigh-
bourhood, at Cranston castle, and naturally describes this
fall in the 6th stanza of that poem, as follows:

     "To pen the pleasures of that Park,
     How every blossom branch and bark
     Against the sun did shyne,
     I pass to Poetis to compyle
     In high heroic statlie style
     Quuhais Muse surmathes myne.
     But as I lukit myne alane,
     I saw a river rin,
     Out'wore a steepie rock of stane
     Syne lichtit in a lin,
     With tumbling, and rumbling
     Amang the rock is round,
     Devalling and falling,
     Into a pit profound."
