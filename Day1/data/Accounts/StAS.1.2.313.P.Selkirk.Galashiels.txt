webs, all faulty yarn; they must be acquainted with all de-
fects in weaving; and, if they are of a nature not to be cor-
rected, or concealed by the subsequent operations, which the
cloth undergoes, they can make both spinsters and weavers ac-
countable for their several mistakes, which cannot thus be
amended.  And the excellence of all cloth depending, in a
great measure, on the equality of the yarn, both as to fineness
and twisting, they have the advantage of knowing and employ-
ing the hands, which some nearest to each other in these re-
spects, and the weavers, who excel in working finer or coarser
yarn.
   Spinning machines possess one eminent advantage over com-
mon wheels.  The yarn on 30, or 36 spindles, is all equally
twisted, and drawn to the same fineness.  And from the na-
ture of the motion, the twist cannot be hard, nor the thread
fine, which renders the cloth soft, firm and durable.  The
most dexterous spinster cannot twist so equally, and so gently,
twenty slips of yarn, from wool of the same quality, as a ma-
chine can do twenty thousand.  And it is now universally a-
greed, that both warp and woof, twisted as gently as the loom
can admit, is most susceptible of being driven close by the
mill, of receiving the strongest dye, and of acquiring the
smoothest surface.

/pArtizans.-  Besides the manufacture of wollen cloth,
which is no doubt the staple of the parish, other branches are
carried to a considerable extent.  Ten persons are employed, 
as skinners and tanners, who pay, for the white and tanned
leather, which they make, from L.  66 to L.  98, of excise to
Government, at an average, yearly.  Seventeen are wrights,
who, besides jobbing as cabinet-makers, and house carpen-
ters, and wheel and mill wrights, and making all the com-
mon implements of husbandry, drive a very considerable trade,
