found of a whirlwind, which I would have perceived it to
have been, had it been day-light, and a cloud of dust to
make it visible.

   Artificial Appearance.-I believe much of the corrusca-
tion of the Aurora Boreali's proceeds from reflection in the
atmosphere.  One night I perceived the atmosphere illu-
mined in quick succession of red flahes, like the Aurora, to
an angle of 20ø or 30ø elevation, and found it was done
by boys, burning pob-tow, about a mile distant, and that
the successive comunications of the atmosphere were occa-
sioned by the tossings of the tow.

   Conjecture.-I have sometimes, in very clear nights, per-
ceived the Milky-way to be a great circle in the heavens,
passing near Aquila, Cygnus, Sirius; and I find it goes
through the southern hemisphere in the same circle conti-
nued.  Its plane, therefore, is a plane which passes through
the centre of the earth.  The conjecture I have founded on
this is, that the Milky-way exhibits to us the position of the
universe, which is a plane (of small comparative thickness)
lying in the position of the Milky-way.  What supports
this conjecture is, that the small motion which the fun has
among the fixed stars, is, in this plane, towards Aquila.

   Diseases incident to Wheat-are the black and rust.  The
black is the most hurtful.  The covering of the grain is en-
tire, but within it is all black powder, which afterwards
blackens, and hurts the found wheat.  If you pull up a
blacked stalk, all the stalks that rise with it from the same
root are blacked likewise.  It is most common in rainy
summers; no effectual remedy is found.  Potatoes are some-
times liable to the scab or curl, especially if the ground be
