quarry was opened there, but from the great dip of the stone, and
the consequent difficulty of working it, a few blocks only were ex-
tracted for a special purpose.  A vein of this stone is supposed to
run from the coast through the intermediate parishes.  It is found
in abundance in Turriff and Montquhitter and partially in the
coast parishes of Gamrie and Aberdour.  None has been met
with, as I have heard, farther west than the point above referred
to at Cammaloun.  There is also at Petts, on the estate of Gight
a quarry of whinstone, valuable for the large slabs obtained from
it.  Some of these have been extracted 10 feet long by 2 broad,
and 6 feet by 4.  They are used in the country for various pur-
poses, and are remarkable for strength and tenacity.
