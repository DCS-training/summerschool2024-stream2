greatly injured the crop of the whole country.  This was
the case in the year 1778, on the 14th of August, when a
gale of westerly wind, of not more than four hours continu-
ance, drove the fray of the sea over the Orkney islands, which
damaged the crop to such a degree, that it was found neces-
sary to import about 18,000 bolls of meal and bear, which,
with large quantities of biscut, potatoes, pease, barley and
malt, cost the consumers no less a sum than 15,000 L. Ster-
ling, that is, nearly twice the gross rent of the country.  Crops
1782, 1783, 1784, 1785, were poor indeed, but not so bad as
that of 1778.  To supply the deficiency of the said four crops,
nearly 20,000 bolls of victual were imported into Orkney.  The
crops for several years last past, have been so much better,
that considerable quantities of victual have been exported.
   The ferries in this district, and through all Orkney, except
on the post road from Caithness to Kirkwall, are not under
proper regulations.  There are no stated ferry-men, the freights
are accordingly imposed at the pleasure of the boatmen who
cross over with passengers, which renders the expence and
trouble of travelling through these islands very great, and dif-
ficult to be ascertained.
   There are ale-houses in almost all the islands, but no inns,
except in Kirkwall and Stromness, the only towns in Orkney;
which circumstance makes it inconvenient for strangers to
pass through this country; this defect, however, is well sup-
plied by the most respectable people in each of the islands,
who receive and accommodate travellers with great hospitality
and kindness.
   The inhabitants of Orkney are nearly the same in number
now, (1794,) according to accounts lately given in by the
several ministers, to the synod of Orkney, as they were found
to be by like accounts given in to Murdoch Mackenzie, ma-
ritime surveyor of there islands, about the year 1750; viz.
from 23 to 24,000.
