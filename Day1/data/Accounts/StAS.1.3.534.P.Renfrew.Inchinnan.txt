to market:-Butter, cheese, fowls, etc.  Thus the people of
the town are served at a reasonable rate; but now the farmer
is above dealing in these things, unless he get an extravagant
price for them.  This will in part account for the great rise
upon these articles; and they must, in all probability, conti-
nue to rise:  For if all these necessaries of life are confined
within the hands of a few farmers, who can raise them at
pleasure, the tradesman must have higher wages, and the
price of the manufacturers must of course be raised, which, in
the end, must be greatly against the trade of this country.

   Church.-The minister's stipend is 8 chalders of meal, and
20 L.  Sterling in cash, exclusive of a manse, and glebe which
consists of 8 acres, that would rent at 40 s. per acre.  Colo-

Templars.  The time when it was built cannot now be as-

been performed in it for a century past.  The manse was re-
paired in 1788, but in so superficial a manner, that it now
stands as much in need of repairs as ever.

   Heritors and Rent.-There are 11 heritors in the parish, 7
of whom reside in it; and of these, 3 possess but a few acres
each.  The valued rent is 23981. 13 s. 4 d.  Scotch, of which
the patron has nearly one half.  The real rent is about 2100 L.
Sterling.

   Improvements.-The property of Lord Douglas, who is a
considerable heritor, was little better, about 30 years ago,
