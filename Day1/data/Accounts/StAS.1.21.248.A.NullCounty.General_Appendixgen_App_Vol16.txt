     General Appendix to [Vol, xvi.

   I do not make my clerical survey of my parish in spring,
and at once.  As soon as the harvest is got in, I begin to
visit on Sabbath afternoons; and continue through winter
and spring, when I have moon light, Until my parochial sur-
vey be completed.  I then find the people at more leisure,
and in a better habit of body and mind; and I am thus pre-
vented from being taken up with idle company at home on
the Sabbath evenings.
   I beg leave to offer my compliments of condolence on the
mournful event of the demise of Lady Janet Sinclair, Sir
John's worthy mother, and a lady eminent for rational piety.
Nigh 30 years since, I was employed by my friend Mr Rose,
at Inverness, to preach in his absence.  The honourable fa-
mily of Ulbster were in church forenoon and afternoon.
They were on their way to Edinburgh; and I heard them
spoken of in every high terms of approbation, for their uni-
form observance of a rule, long before adopted, not to travel
on the Sabbath day, when they were on a journey, and to at-
tend divine service: an example worthy of imitation, which
many in these days are not disposed to imitate.
   I received the paper with hints about potatoes.  The peo-
ple here are not very fond of them.  I got a great variety of
kinds from the late Mrs Udny Duff; but they are very in-
different about any kind, except what they call kidney pota-
toes or long white.
   I find I should have taken notice that one farmer here
commonly brings 150 bolls of shell-lime from Aberdeen
each year.-I said that Gormack-burn, after taking an ellip-
tical sweep, falls into Leuchar-burn: it would have been more
accurate to have said, after forming some parabolic and ser-
pentine curves, falls into Leuchar-burn.
