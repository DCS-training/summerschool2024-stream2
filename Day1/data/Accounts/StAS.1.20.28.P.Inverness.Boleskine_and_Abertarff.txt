the consequence is a redundant crop of corn; but when this
happens after the seed is in the ground, it generally proves
the destruction of the crop; but the portions of lands, conti-
guous to rivers, always produce the most exuberant crop of
natural hay and pasturage.

   Agricultural Process.-Although no parish is better sup-
plied by nature with limestone, there being abundance
thereof in the lands of Foyers in Statherrick, and in Aber-
chalder in Abertarf, it is with regret we must mention,
that the same has proved of very little benefit to the inha-
bitants of this parish.  We do not learn that any part of
Abertarf has been tried with lime as a manure, although
many of the farms are within a very little distance of the
quarry.  It is true, Mr James Fraser, writer to the signet,
proprietor of the lands of Gortuleg, has, within these 5 or
6 years, manured his ground with lime brought from the
quarries of Mr Fraser of Foyers; from the ruggedness of the
road, he is obliged to lead the lime-stone on horses backs to his
farm, or places nearly contiguous thereto; and as he has abun-
dance of convenient fuel, he is enabled to burn them, in kilns
built in the corners of his fields, with less expence than any
of his neighbours; and although the consequential returns of 
green crops, potatoes, and corn, greatly exceeds what is
usual in that country, the great expence of procuring this
manure, does not seem to afford sufficient encouragement, for
his example admitting of imitation; but probably the he-
ritor of this quarry, may lay down a plan, for disposing of
the raw materials, at a moderate rate, for a specific number
of years, and his neighbours may thereby be induced to
make sufficient roads to the quarry, and thereby, with all
local inconveniences, make a trial of this species of manure, 
especially as the country abounds in variety of mosses,
which has now been found by experience to be an excel-
