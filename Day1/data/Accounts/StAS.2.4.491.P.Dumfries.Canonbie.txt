would have followed the name, as a part of the title of distinction
of every king who comes after the first of the name. We may re-
mark, that, during the reign of Edward I., there was a constant com-
munication with Scotland, "the affairs of which," says Hume the
historian, "from the most interesting period of his reign." From
great numbers of coins of the same kind being found in various parts
of Annandale, particularly around the burgh of Lochmaben, we
are of opinion that these coins were secreted in Canonbie and An-
nandale, at the time when Warrenne, in 1298, marched an army of
40,000 men into the latter district to re-establish the authority of
Edward, which Wallace had for some time so nobly opposed.
	Modern Buildings.--Among these worthy of note, as held in
feus from his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch, are, Woodhouselees;
the occasional residence of George Bell, Esq. merchant, Leith;
Forge, that of Pultney Mein, Esq.; Marsh House, of Colonel W.
Mein; Crookholm, of Colonel N. Mein; and Woodslee, of George
Scott Elliott, Esq. of Larriston.
	The corn-mills erected some years ago at Hollows are exten-
sive buildings, and the machinery of the most approved kind.
These mills are driven by a subterranean dam cut through the
solid rock, and, by this means, have at all seasons of the year an
abundant supply of water from the Esk, near the banks of which
they are situated.

	Character, &c. of the People.--The dispositions and habits of
the people of this parish have undergone, within these last fifty years,
a wonderful change for the better. At that period, much of the
spirit of the borderers pervaded the inhabitants; and gambling was
carried on to such a degree that all industry was laid aside, so that
many depeded for their subsistence upon the precarious results
