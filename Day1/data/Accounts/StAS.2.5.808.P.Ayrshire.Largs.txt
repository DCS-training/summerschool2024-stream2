of Greenock.  At Fairlie, a chapel in connexion with the Esta-
blishment was erected by private subscription in 1833, opened in
1834, and erected as a quoad sacra parish in 1835.  It contains
300 sitters, and affords great accommodation to the inhabitants of
that district of the parish.  The first minister of this congregation
was James Gardiner, who died in 1835, and was succeeded by the
Reverend John Gemmill, A.M., the present minister.
   The Church was removed from the burying-ground situated in
the centre of the village, and a new one built, in a more open and
eligible situation in 1812.  It was seated for 900, but, being found
too small, particularly for the extra population of the summer, cross
aisles were added to its eastern extremity in 1832, which accom-
modate 432 additional sitters.  This addition was made from funds
belonging to the poor, and the seats are annually let out, and the
rents yield a good return, which adds to the ordinary funds ex-
pended by the kirk-session.
   The manse stood formerly in the inmediate vicinity of the old
church, and near the site of the Brisbane Arms Inn, now belonging
to Mrs Strachan.  It was sold by the minister and heritors in 1764,
when the present manse and offices were built on part of the glebe.
The house has been recently repaired, and is a comfortable and
commodious residence.  The glebe consists of seven acres.
   Dissenters.--A congregation of the United Associate Synod
was formed here about 1780.  Their first minister was William
Watson, who was ordained 15th January 1783.  He was translated
to Old Kilpatrick in 1789.  In December 1791, John Leech was
ordained as his successor, who demitted, and died in Glasgow in
1822, being succeeded by Daniel Maclean, who was ordained 22d
October 1823, and deposed 29th November 1829.  He was suc-
ceeded, by the present minister, William Steven, who was ordain-
ed 31st August 1830.  The church was rebuilt in 1826, and is
seated for nearly 700 sitters.  There is also a comfortable manse
for the minister.
   A congregation of Relief is now being formed.  A small meeting-
house has been erected, capable of containing 450 sitters; but
hitherto no minister has been ordained.
   Education.--There was a parochial school in 1696, with a sa-
lary of 100 merks, but no school-house.  In 1809, a comfortable
school and schoolmaster's house were built by the heritors.  The
present schoolmaster is Alexander Jack, who has under his charge
115 scholars.  Sir Thomas M. Brisbane has recently, at the ex-
