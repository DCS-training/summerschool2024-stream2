     Statistical Account

   Rivers.-There are no rivers which run through the pa-
rish.  The river of Irvine, which takes its rise to the east of
Loudonhill, in the parish of Loudon, in times of floods,
carries great quantities of sand along with it, chiefly after it
passes Irvine, which being thrown out at the Bar, is gradual-
ly removing it to a greater distance from the harbour.  The
depth of water, from the Quay to the Bar, is generally from
9 to 11 feet, at spring tides.  In high storms, with the wind
from the south or south-west, it is sometimes 16 feet.

   Roads-The roads leading to and from the town are, 1ft,
The Kilmarnock road to the south-east.  2d, the Ayr road
to the south.  3d, The Greenock road by Kilwinning to
the north-west; and, 4th, The Glasgow road by Stewarton
to the north-east.  They are all kept in tolerable repair by
the statute labour, which is converted into money, and paid
to the trustees.  Three shillings Sterling are paid by every
householder in the town for that purpose, which, in many
instances, is a very hard and oppressive tax, especially in sea-
port towns, where there are so many sailors widows, lest with
numerous families, and often in poor circumstances.  This is
an evil which calls for redress.  Besides the statute money,
there are tolls nigh to the town, on the Stewartoun, Kilmar-
nock, and Ayr roads.
   A fly goes regularly from this to Glasgow, by Kilwinning,
Dalry, Beath, and Paisley, three times every week.  A stage
coach runs from this to Greenock twice in the week, and
continues to be well employed.

   Manufactures.-Manufactures, as yet, are not carried on
here to any extent.  The young men, in general, are sailors,
or go abroad to the West Indies and America as storekeep-
ers and planters.  Many from this place and the neighbour-
