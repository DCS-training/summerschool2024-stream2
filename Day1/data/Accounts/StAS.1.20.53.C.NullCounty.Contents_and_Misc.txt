employ, some incidents of that fort were unavoidable.

     No XV.  Circular Letter, sent in April 1797.

     SIR,

   I AM very much disappointed, at not having hitherto received the Statisti-
cal Account of your parish.  There are very few now deficient, and
you cannot imagine the bad effect which the want of those must have, in
the opinion of many who are perpetually inquiring, whether the Statistical
Account of Scotland is, or is not, completed?  It is unnecessary for me, I

matter at so busy a time in Parliament as this.  I remain, with esteem,
your faithful and obedient servant,

ful an undertaking.

     No XVI.  Note, written with Red Ink, to the Clergymen who had not
        given in their Statistical Accounts, 11th July 1797.

   SIR JOHN SINCLAIR presents his compliments to
He sets out for Scotland next week, and will be much disappointed in-
deed, if he has not the pleasure of finding the Statistical Account of
                          ready for him; as, on his arrival, he must bring
the Work to an immediate conclusion.  There are now only six deficient
parishes; and from the Draconian colour of his ink, any Statistical delin-
quent may fee, what the rear rank has to look for.  Sat sapienti
