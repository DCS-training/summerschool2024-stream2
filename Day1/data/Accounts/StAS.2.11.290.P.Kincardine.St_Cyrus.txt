290			KINCARDINESHIRE.

The whole of these fishings, which comprehend the entire extent of
the sea-coast, and of the North Esk river, from its mouth to the
boundary of the lands of Morphy, brnufht, in 1837, a rental of
L.3591. The fishing of Comeston and Kinnaber includes part
of the river and sea coast, and the latter property being in the pa-
rish of Montrose, a moiety of the value of this, fishing, which is
the joint property of the respective proprietors, falls to be deduct-
ed from the above rental, and the remainder, or L. 2991, was the
revenue in the year referred to, from the fishings connected with
this parish. Reports of the number of fish caught at some of the
stations are given in the minutes of evidence before a committee of
the House of Commons in 1825. So many as 3000 fish, includ-
ing salmon, grilses, and trouts, are said to have been caught in one
day in July 1835. The number of men employed is about sixty;
wages, from 8s. to 15s. a week, with fish-money, or an additional
allowance according to the number caught. Prices of salmon vary
from 8d. to 2s. 6d. per lb.; and the greater part of the fish is
transported in ice to the Edinburgh and London markets.
	There has been, for many years, a small white-fishery carried
on by the inhabitants of the village of Milton. In 1781, the vil-
lage contained 46 families, comprising 170 individuals, and had
three boats, with six men to each, engaged in the white-fishing.
But in 1792, the village was, as before mentioned, partially de-
stroyed, and the fishermen wdrd, at the same time, deprived of
their harbour. Since that time, not more than one or two small
boats have been employed, and the population of Milton, with
that of Tangleha, is now reduced to fifty souls. One boat is still
engaged in the white-fishing, and affords support to two or three
families.
        Produce.-For the purpose of arriving at an approximate value
of the raw  produce, it has been attempted to ascertain, with as
much precision as possible, the number of acres under each kind
of crop, and the average produce of each acre. The following
results have been obtained:
