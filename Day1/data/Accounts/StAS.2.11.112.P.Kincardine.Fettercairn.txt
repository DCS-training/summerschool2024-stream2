   The highest part of the Grampians, here, does not ascend more
than 1600 feet above the level of the sea. Their angles of ascent
range probably from 30&deg; to 40&deg;. Their lower undulations, as
they slope down to the plain country, give a diversified and pleas-
ing, but not a hilly appearance, to the landscape.
   Meteor•logy.--A register of the weather, kept from 1816 to
1836, by an intelligent observer in the parish, (from which the
years ending Ist September 1817, 1821, 1826, and 1831, are se-
lected as likely to give a fair averafe of that period,)--leads us to
conclude that there were dry days in each year, 222; wet days or
days in which rain, hail, sleet, or snow fell, in some quantity or
other, 143; majority dry, 79.

From this statement, it may be inferred that, on the whole, the
climate is good. Accordingly, invalids, who require change of air,
often derive much benefit from it during the summer season. Still,
at other times, the sudden changes of temperature, and the fre-
quent prevalence of cold fogs and hoar frosts, are very apt to pro-
duce all the varieties of inflammatory affections, which are the most
common diseases,
	Hydrography.--In the hill above Fasque, there is a spring of
a distinctly chalybeate character. There is another, about one-
fourth of a mile below the village, on the Fettercairn estate.  In
many other pl`ces in the parish, the water seems impregnated
with iron, from the quantities of oxide of iron which appear in the
bottoms of drains, and other situations, where it converts the stag-
nant water into a coagulated state. No iron rock has been dis-
covered near these places. No rivers take their rise in or run
through this parish. But the North Esk, after it issues from the
mountain forms the. boundary between it and Edzell, for the
space of nearly four miles. This river then runs almost due east,
for, about nine miles, and enters the German Ocean, a few miles
north of Montrose. In the neighbourhood of The Burn, its banks
