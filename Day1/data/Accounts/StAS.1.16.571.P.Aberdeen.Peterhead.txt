Idea of the state of agriculture in this parish, than the irre-
gular size of the farms, which are determined more by local
circumstances, than a general spirit for improvement.

   Rent of Land.-In the country part of the parish I do not
think there is any estate which yields above 12 s. at an ave-
rage per acre, and there are not many that can be estimated
at 10 s.  The lands in the vicinity of the town of Peterhead
let at from L. 1, 10 s. to four guineas each acre.  Here there
is a spur to industry, and in consequence great exertions are
made, and very weighty crops are raised, particularly of
potatoes, bear, and grass.  There is scarce a day-labourer
or manufactuter who does not raise potatoes, by taking a
few falls of ground, from 4 d. to 1 s. each fall, trenching
and hoeing the ground, and taking up the potatoes, with his
own hands.  He is employed about this work, after he has
spent the day at his ordinary employment, which tends to
promote his health, gives a wholesome nourishment to his
family, and enables him to go on at his sedentary bu-
siness at home with more animation and spirit.  In conse-
quence of the general attention bestowed on raising pota-
toes, I think the manner of managing that crop is as well
understood here, as in any other part of the kingdom, and
as weighty crops are raised as in any other place.  The
ground is generally trenched out of ley, sometimes after it
has carried one crop of oats, without any manure; by fre-
quent hoeing, the weeds are kept down in summer, and
the potatoes are taken up with a spade.  The expence of
the management of one acre, exclusive of rent and seed, is
not less than five guineas; but it is not uncommon to have
above 50 bolls, of 32 stone Dutch weight each boll, from
an acre.  An ordinary crop is estimated at 40 bolls, which
are generally sold at 8 s. per boll; and I am acquainted
with repeated instances of eight acres in one person's pof-
