of rich holm land, the washings of both waters for time
immemorial consisting of deep loam, very productive un-
der proper culture.  The other cultivated lands are gene-
rally light and dry, lying on a slatey and ragged rock, or
gravel, which, with lime, marl and dung, produce very
well.  The hilly parts are generally dry, green, with ve-
ry little heath, and fit for cattle or sheep.  The air is dry
and healthy, because the country has a fine open exposure to
the S. and W.  The spring in favourable seasons is early.
The summer sometimes extremely hot.  Harvest soon on
the western side.  Winter stormy and cold.  High winds,
heavy rains, but seldom any continuation of snow, though
of frost in some seasons for upwards of one, two, or three
months together, which is always reckoned a preparation
for, and a prognostication of a kindly spring, a nourishing
summer, and plentiful harvest.  Peats are scarce, some-
times sold for 2 s. 3 s. and even 4 s. the single cart-load.
Coals are brought from Sanquhar in the upper part of
Nithsdale, Tindall, Fell, and Archerbeck in Cumber-
land, at the distance of 30 and 40 miles, and sold at 9 s.
the cart load in Lockerbie; an insuperable bar to rising
manufactures at present, and principally occasioned by the
unproductive and impolitical tax on coals over the Solway
Frith, which is said and expected soon to be taken off
there, and also in similar situations in Scotland, which
would be a vast benefit to the country.  No epidemical
diseases are peculiar to this parish.  The common duration
of human life is 60 years, though some advance to 70, 80,
and 90.

   Population, etc.-According to Dr Webster's report, the

is about 1600; 700 in the thriving town of Lockerbie, and
900 in the country part of the parish.  There are about
