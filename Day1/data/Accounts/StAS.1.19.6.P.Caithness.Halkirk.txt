and of all other vegetables that are allowed to be in the
ground longer than the spring, summer and harvest.  These
disadvantages are not more peculiar to this parish than to
the other parishes of the county.
   Advantages, arising from the same Causes.-These dis-
advantages, are, however, in a great measure compensated
by advantages arising from the same causes.  If these strata
will not suffer the water to penetrate through them, yet by
keeping it so near the surface, it soon dries or runs off, by
being so much exposed to sun and wind, and there being no
great depth of earth to retain it, or interrupt its progress
to the swamps, lakes, burns, rivers.  If the ground is kept
by them cold, damp, and chilly, in spring or seed-time, or
even after that time, which, as was already observed, is no
small impediment to agriculture, and ocasions a slow vege-
tation, yet, in the months of June, July, and August, it
becomes very warm and tepid, very nourishing to the ten-
der vegetables.  In these months, by reason of the great
length of the day, and of the earth being laid on these hard
and impenetrable strata, as above observed, to very near
the surface; in these months, and for these reasons, I
say, our crops make a very rapid progress; nay, I will
venture to say, a much greater, than in any part of Great
Britain, or even in more southern kingdoms, in that short
period of time.  From this circumstance it happens, that
we have as good a crop generally, and as early a harvest,
and oftentimes earlier, than they have in more southern
countries.  But I must say, that all our prospect of a crop
depends in a very great measure on the complexion and
temperature of these months.  If they are favourable, we
are sure of a great and good crop; if not, we have no great
reason to expect a suitable return.
   Another advantage, worthy to be observed, is, that these
flags, or flat stones, are most excellently calculated for
building, and that with great case and expedition, and
