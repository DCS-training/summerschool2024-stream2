1783; and, had not a considerable importation taken place
the effects must have been dreadful.  A benevolent socie-
ty, under the patronage of Mr Barclay of Ury, was form-
ed at Stonehaven, for purchasing meal and grain to be retailed
at an under price in that town and the neighbourhood, of which
this parish felt the good effects.  There were some hundred
pounds lost, (if money sunk on such an emergency can be called
a loss), which Mr Barclay generously paid, partly out of his
own pocket, and partly by donations from his friends in Lon-
don, given for that purpose.-The well-meant supply gifted by
Government came at least six weeks too late to give the intend-
ed relief.  There were bear-meal and potatoes of crop 1783
before it came to hand.  It, moreover, consisted of very bad
meal, made of damaged pease and bear ground together.  From
the lateness of its coming, and the badness of its quality (as
famine only could have compelled the people to eat it) some are
induced to think that the merchants were the greatest, if not
the only gainers.  Had Government, instead of sending meal,
ordered the sum they voted to be paid to the several kirk-sessions
in due proportions, the Scotch merchants would have suppli-
ed the parish with good grain or meal (when mostly needed)
for the money.
   There are no forests and very little planted wood of any
kind; neither will wood thrive, owing to the eastern exposure,
and the height of the land.
