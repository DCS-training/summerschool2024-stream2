     Of Sprouston.

   Persons who become objects of charity, from sickness, or other
causes, are relieved by the session out of the weekly collec-

the poor enrolled are inventoried, and told at their decease,
which is a check against impositions.

   Price of Provisions and Labour.-The price of all kinds of
provisions, especially of oatmeal, has greatly increased; and
if potatoes had not been introduced, the price of oatmeal
must have been still higher.  There is a considerable advance
in the wages of all servants.  Men, during harvest, receive
L. 1: 4: 0, and women L. 1, with diet; a man hired for a
day 1 s.; and a woman 10 d.  Forty years ago, a man's wa-

1 s. a-day in summer, and 10 d. in winter.  His wages are
sufficient to enable him to bring up a family.  Taylors wages
are lately advanced from 4 d. to 6 d. and 8 d. a-day.

this parish, abounds with salmon.  They sell high in the 
spring, the greatest part of them being sent, by Berwick, to
London; but the prices vary considerably; and in summer,
they are tolerably cheap.  There is a project for carrying a
canal, along the Tweed, from Berwick to Kelso, or even
higher.
 
   Miscellaneous Observations.-Sea sowls appear here in great
numbers in the spring, about seed-time; they follow the
plough, and are thence called sced-birds.  Coal, the only fuel
used here, is brought from England.  The roads are bad,
owing, probably, to the statute labour being commuted.  It
is the general opinion that turnpikes have improved the coun-
