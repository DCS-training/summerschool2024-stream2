mills, and boulted by hand-sieves.  Now, about 7000 bolls
are made use of annually; it is ground in mills, which are
made for the purpose of preparing flour; it is boulted, and
the different kinds separated by machinery, which is con-
structed according to the latest improvements.  Seven of
these mills are within a few miles of the town.
   Forty years ago there were but 2 grocers in Falkirk
they complained of little business, and one of them was
also a tallow-chandler.  They had all their grocery goods
from Borrowstounness, and imported nothing themselves.
We have now 22 in that line of business; some of them

by the lord of the manor.  But the power of life and death
is not now attached to any barony.  He can, within the
bounds of his jurisdiction, enforce the payment of rents to
