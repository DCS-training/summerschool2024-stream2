that spot forms a striking contrast with the struggle and disaster
to which the next day's march conducted him. From Rhin he

                       III.-POPULATION.
  A codtintied decrease is found in the population of the parish
of Rogart since the year IS I 1,-as may be seen by comparing the
census of that year with the census of 1831, and with these sta-
tistics.  This decrease has been caused by emigration to the pro-
vinces subject to Britain in North America,-chiefly to Upper
Canada.

   Language.- The Celtic, or Gaelic, language is spoken by almost
all the inhabitants. There are a few shepherds who do not speak
this language; but their families do.  A considerable proportion
of the inhabitants,, however, can converse in the English language;
and, in a few years it is likely that none may be found who cannot
do so. Their English, being acquired from books, and occasional
