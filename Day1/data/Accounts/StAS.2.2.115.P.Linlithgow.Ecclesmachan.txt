it is used as a preaching station in the Sabbath evenings. Every
person in the parish, of suitable age, is able to read. It is not
ascertained that they can all write.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-At present there are three paupers
on the roll; viz. an aged woman, who receives 5s. a month, an il-
legitimate child, and a lunatic confined in a private asylum. The
heritors support the latter by private assessment. A few re-
ceive occasional assistance. The ordinary collections amount to
about L. 11, and there is, besides, the sum of L. 2, 12s. per annum,
the interest of bonded money. Hitherto, there has been no legal
assessment; but, it is feared, that one may at length become ne-
cessary, from the demand of aliment for illegitimate children, to
which this parish, owing to the shifting habit of its youthful po-
pulation, and other unfavourable circumstances, is much exposed.
