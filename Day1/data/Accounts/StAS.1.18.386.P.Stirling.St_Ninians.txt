those times gives sufficient reason to believe, that Ninian was
afterwards canonized: and as no other saint of that name
occurs in our history, it is not unreasonable to conclude, that
St. Ninian's Row in Edinburgh, St. Ninian's Well in this
place, as well as this parish and village, received their appel-
lations in honour of this pious reformer.
   It is not necessary to suppose that the parish adopted the
name of the saint immediately after his death, or even imme-
diately after his canonization.  In our own times, new build-

tershall, Clayhills, Newhouse, and Bannockburn.  Pow-
milne and Polmaise appear to be derived from pou, a provin-
cial word, signifying a watery place.  From the Gaelic we
must learn the meaning of such names as these: Touch,
Touch-adam, Touch-gorm, Auchenbowic, and Auchenlilly,
Linspout.

   Situation.-The parish belongs to the synod of Perth and
Stirling, and to the presbytery of Stirling.  It is bounded
on the east by the parish of Airth; on the south, by Lar-
bart, Dunipace, and Kilsyth; on the west, by Fintry and
Gargunnock; the river Forth, if the small space occupied by
the parish of Stirling be excepted, separates it on the north
from Kincardine, Lecropt, Logie, and Alloa.

   Extent.-The road between Powbridge, the eastern extre-
mity of the parish, and Randyford, the western extremity,
measures between 15 and 16 miles: but as the figure of the
