houses allowed to retail it, is an irresistible temptation to people
of this description, and consumes a considerable part of the
weekly charity.  What a fatal policy is it not in any govern-
mint, to encourage a mamufacture so peculiarly destructive,
for the sake of converting a small proportion of the profit de-
rived from it, into revenue?
   Such dispositions among the lower ranks occasion also a
great many beggars, who stroll about exacting contributions
from the compassion of individuals, their demands not being sa-
tisfied in the distribution of the charitable funds.  But the num-
ber of beggars, belonging to this parish, is tristling, compared to
the crowds of vagrants of every description, who swarm from
the populous towns around, and spread over the country, beg-
ging, cheating, swindling, or stealing, as best suits their pur-
pose.  And here, as in other places, they have several insa-
mous haunts, to which they resort for lodging, dispose of
their booty, and spend their sinister gettings in the grossest
riot and debauch:  and, as soon as these are exhausted, they a-
gain issur forth to practice every art upon the public, which
unprincipled ingenuity, stimulated by want, can devise.
How worthy would it not be of the generous exertions of pa-
triotic spirits, to find means of restraining these insidious depre-
dations, and turning the activity and address of vagrants to 
more innocent and useful purposes!
