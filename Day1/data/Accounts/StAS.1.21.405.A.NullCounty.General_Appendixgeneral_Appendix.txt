     The Statistical Account.

where lands are possessed by corporations, and occupied by
the whole of the members in undivided commonty (a mode
of occupation infallibly condemning them to a state of com-
parative non-production, so long as it continues) it is still
possible, though I own, not very probable, that the members
may have the good sense, and may also fortunately agree to
let the whole to a single farmer upon such security of tenure
as shall communicate to him an interest leading at least to all
the necessary outlay of mere soil-improvements-though no

The clergyman has, however, no farther interest in his glebe
than his own uncertain life, or still more uncertain incum-

the tacksman.  Without doubt, in the course of their pro-
fessional education, most of the clergy receive a tincture of

ment of the lands must, however, rest upon more efficient
principles than mere taste, else it will make but slow progress.
   Several schemes have been submitted to the General As-
sembly to create in the clergy a certain interest in the im-

turn, and most important consequence such as draining,
planting and inclosing; though all attempts at an arrange-
ment to this effect, have as yet, been unsuccesful.  The ge-
neral idea of the plans last submitted to the General Assem-
bly (so far as I recollect) seemed equitable:  viz. that the
Church should apply for an Act of Parliament, vesting in the In-
