sent church.  Ah there circumstances, together with its prox-
imity to Peeblesshire, which was in the diocese of Glasgow-
show, that this parish was originally church land, and con-
firm the opinion that it took its name from the Saint above
mentioned.

   Extent, Soil, etc.-The parish is extensive, being 11 or 12
miles long and 6 broad, but in many places intersected by
large corners of other parishes.  The Esk runs through the
middle of it from W. to E. and almost divides the parish.
The Pentland Hills stretch from E. to W. upon the north
side of the parish.  The highest of these hills is 1600 feet
above the level of the sea at Leith.-The soil is various, con-
sisting of clay, gravel, sand, and moss, with their combina-
tions.  There is but little wheat raised in the parish; oats, and
barley, pease, turnips, and potatoes, succeed well, but grafts
seems to be the most profitable crop; the others should be
attended to only in order to assist its growth.  Upon the best
and low grounds of the parish, the following rotation of crops
will answer, viz. 1st, fallow, turnips or potatoes; 2d, bar-
ley with clover and rye grass; 3 d, hay, one crop only, as the
clover generally fails the second crop; 4th, oats.  It is found
that washing the milk dishes with water in which a little salt-
petre has been dissolved, entirely removes the inconvenience
to the dairy from turnip feeding, and takes away the dis-
agreeable taste it is apt to produce in the milk.-The two
horse chain ploughs with the curved mould board, for im-
proved, and the Scotch plough, for unimproved, ground, are
those commonly used.  The sheep are much of the same sort,
and treated in the same manner, as those in Linton parish*.
