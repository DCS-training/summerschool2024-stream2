     Statistical Account

with much expence, yet it may be reckoned among the ad-
vantages of the parish, that it is indented and almost sur-
rounded with arms of the sea, many of which form safe
anchorage for shipping in the worst weather.  Loch-alin
Bay, running in from the Sound of Mull in the S. E. part of
the parish, forms a safe and capacious harbour; but it is
rather narrow at the mouth, and not of easy entrance, unless
with either a favourable tide or fair wind.  There is another
late and commodious harbour at the mouth of Loch-Suineart,
called Drumby; it is, on the Morven side, formed by a deep
and clear inlet, betwixt the island Oronsay and the main-
land.  There are besides numberless fine creeks for small
boats; and, along the coast, scarce a bay wherein a vessel of
any tonnage may not pass a tide.
