inhabitants.  In 1791, one person died at the age of 95;
at present, there is one man in the parish above 90, an-
other 89, and several others near to that period.  The
small pox is the most frequent, and the most fatal epidemical
disorder.  The young are subjected to its ravages every
two or three years.  In some years, it is more fatal than
in others.  In 1790, almost one half of the children, that 
siezed with it in the village of Clackmannan, died. 
This is not to be wondered at:  Considering the bad treat-
ment, it is rather astonishing how any escape.  As soon
as the infection has seized the child, he is put to bed; a
large fire is kindled; he is smothered up with blankets,
that he may not catch cold; while, to hasten the eruption,
a mixture of warm milk and whisky is, from time to time,
poured down his throat.  Among many of the farmers,
however, the better sort of the inhabitants, inoculation is
become frequent, and is practiced with great success.  On-
ly two instances have occured in the parish, during the
last 14 years, of children dying, where this mode has been
used; and even these two instances, it is said, were owing
to the parents not attending to the directions of the sur-
geon.  Yet, notwithstanding all this, the prejudice against
inoculation is deeply rivotted in the minds of the great
body of the people.  They look upon it as a tempting of
Providence; and would consider themselves as guilty of a
species of murder, is the event should prove fatal.  There 
have been some instances of children dying by the measeles
and hooping-cough; but there are no numerous*.

month of August, a dysentery made its appearance, and raged with such
uncommon violence, that even in the small village of Clackmannan alone,
upwards of twenty persons, almost all of them heads of families, fell vic-
