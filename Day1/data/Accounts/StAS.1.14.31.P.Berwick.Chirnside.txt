     Of Chirnside.

   That the ancient Caledonians did not consume with
fire, but simply inter their dead, and that the monu-
ments of their graves were only the heaped clod, or the
grey stone; whence subsequently came the accumulated
cairns, in conformity to the traditional ordinance of the
Norwegian, or Danish god of war, Woden, has been
commonly admitted among antiquaries.  But it is con-
tended by some of them, that the South Britons had
adopted the custom of burning the bodies of their dead,
from their continental neighbours in Armorica (the in-
habitants of Bretagne) in ancient Gaul; who are said
to have practised it, even before the Romans invaded
Britain:  yet, although this be a very disputable point,
it is not doubted, that the usage of the conquerors had
been partly followed, not only by the natives of the
subjugated countries in the S., but also those who
dwelt between the 2 Roman walls; some of whom being
frequently in leagues, and prosessed amity with that ci-
vilized people, learned, as their historians affirm, many
of their customs and arts.  Hence, it is alleged, that
such numbers of their sort of sepulchral urns have been
dug up, in places where the Romans are not known to

sides, rudely constructed of stones, with mortar of lime, had a few unshaped
flags extended over them; upon which the plough-share appeared to have
sometimes grazed.  May we not, therefore, justly conclude, that at or
near the place where such sepulchral remains, as those described, were
found, some Roman troops, if not an army, had taken, not only their pas-
sage, but a temporary station; especially, as it would require some space of
time for burning, in their manner, and collecting the bones of their dead,
or slain; who, when of rank, were distinguished, by having some more
honoured part of their ashes put into urns; and for the depositing and pre-
servation of which, the gravelly or driest ground was always looked for,
and chosen.
