the minister, one heritor, and two farmers.  Now there are
about 40 in St Andrews alone.  Most of them are drawn
by an ox, yoked in the same way as a horse.  Harrows of
two or three bulls, with wooden teeth, were formerly used,
but are now justly exploded in most farms, and those of two
or three bulls, with short iron teeth, are used in their stead.
Even these seem too light, and the people much neglect the
brakeing their ground.  The harrows are drawn side-ways
by a train or side rope, (like that used in a plough), fasten-
ed at each end; which method of harrowing does great in-
justice to the land.  Rotation of crops is here unknown.  A
few potatoes, with oats and bear sown alternately, have, for
many years, occupied the same spot of ground.  Rye-grass
and clover, have been tried with success, by the minister and
one heritor.  They have also tried pease; but, owing to
the frequent rains in the end of summer, and the beginning
of harvest, have scarce got one good crop in seven.  Turnips
thrive tolerably well in these parishes, but are seldom used.

   Hill and Common.-The hill and common round these pa-
rishes, is black and heathy, affording shelter for numbers of
moor-fowl, and such other birds as delight in this sort of
soil.  No wood, of any kind, can be made to grow here, or
in any part of Orkney, where it has been tried; and even
the most common shrub cannot be raised without the great-
est difficulty, though it is observable in many places, even
under the flat sea-beech, where the storms or other accidents
wash off the gravel or sand, that black peat-moss, stuck
through with trees, seems to have been the original soil.
Sometimes a whole tree has been found, and the smallest
fibre so strong as to bear lifting.  And in a peat-moss in
Deerness, at the depth of four feet, roots of trees and hazel-
nuts have been dug up, the nuts quite entire.  This would
