rocks, and upheaved in very many places from its original horizon-
tal position by the granitic invasion from below. To what extent
the altitude of Mealfaurvonie be owing  to granitic displace-
ment we have no means of determining; but it is remarkable that
the great upper dome or rounded summit of this mountain, which
is elevated, as already noticed, 3200 feet above the sea, is one en-
tire mass of conglomerate rock, (the abraded portions consisting
of granite, gneiss, mica-slate, quartz rock, and sandstone, cohering
together almost without any basis or cement,) and that the strati-
fied sandstone at its base has been so indurated, probably from the
influence of a subjacent but contiguous mass of granite, as in many
places to have lost its distinctly stratified disposition, and to have
acquired so hard and crystalline a texture as has rendered it fit to
be used as a causeway stone for the streets of Inverness. The
hardened variety has sometimes been described as quartz rock.
This enormous sandstone deposit is now disjoined from the simi-
lar rocks which composed the eastern termination of the Great
Glen by Loch Ness, and the granitic hills of Caiplich and Doch-
four; but when surveyed from Mealfaurvonie the conglome-
rate rides of Foyers and Balliechernock described in the Ac-
count of Dores parish, appear once to have been connected with
it; while on the north, across the valley of Urquhart, the junction
with the main eastern deposit of sandstone is completed through
the upper braes of Kiltarlity.
   We have mentioned that the portion of Glen Urquhart next
Loch Ness consists of the stratified sandstone and its associated
conglomerate. Of the latter, almost all the eminences which sur-
round it are composed; and beneath their rough and bare sur-
mits a broad plateau, gently declining towards the centre of the
valley occurs,-on the inner lip or edge of which the sides of the
glen sink rapidly down, showing that the bases of the higher
summits were at one time washed by a great body of water, which
rested on the plateau just mentioned, and which subsequently dis-
charge itself by the trough below forming the present course of
the river Enneric. In causing these excavations, the waters ap-
pear to have encountered three principal barriers; one now open-
ed into Loch Ness, at the mouth of the valley, one stretching across
from Craigmony, a little to the west of Drumnadrochit, and one at
or above Dalshangy, where the separation between the upper and
lower valleys is still visible.
