in some parts of the south of Scotland by the name of the
lugged spade.  With this he cuts in the furrow all the turf,
fit for his purpose, that he can collect.  The clods so cut are
taken up by the hands of a second person, who lays them
closely over the manure on the rigg.  If he cannot afford to
employ a couple more hands on the opposite side of the rig,
he must go round it, thus cutting and laying on the sod till
all is covered.  As the surface is very strong, and the soil by
nature absolutely barren, an immense quantity of sea-weed
is necessary to force from it a tolerable crop.  It generally
takes no less than 200 large creel-fulls, if not mixed with dung
or any other compost, to yield a boll of barley, or if sown
with potatoes, which is the most ordinary as well as the most
beneficial crop raised in there creeks, about 12 or 14 barrels.
The lazy-bed, thus roughly covered with such sod or turf as
the ground affords, is left in this state till the time of sow-
ing, generally very late in the spring; when, previous to its
receiving the seed, another operation of considerable labour is
found necessary to pulverise it, that is, breaking down the
rough clods with a heavy kind of hoe, which, in the toughest
parts of the soil, takes up nearly as much time as the first
operation of covering the lazy-bed.  Then the seed is sown;
if with barley, pretty thin; if with potatoes, the cuttings are
planted, with a dibble, not many inches asunder.  The finish-
ing operation is the harrowing, which is done with a hand
rake, having six timber teeth and a handle about 2 feet long.
In the whole of this process, the men are generally assisted by
their wives and all their children above 12 years old.  The
picture above drawn of the arduous labour of lazy-bed culture,
holds true in respect to every other place through the pa-
rish, where the ground does nat admit of being ploughed,
with this exception, that the manure is led up, and the har-
