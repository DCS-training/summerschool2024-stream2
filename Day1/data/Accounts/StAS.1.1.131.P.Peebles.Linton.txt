self with his hands on the floor, several stones came up.
The man was of decent character; and from his own, and
his neighbours reports, there is no doubt of the fact.  The
largest stone was the size of a finger end.  He threw up 13,
which, being the Devil's dozen, might probably the num-
ber swallowed.  Latterly, his surgeon made him vomit in
an inclined position, and he threw up sand, which probably
had fallen from his victuals into some sack formed in the sto-
mach by the weight of the stones.  The stones must have
been lodged in his stomach for about 16 years.

   Mines, Minerals, Springs, etc.-There is white free-stone
at Deepsyke-head and at Spittlehaugh.  The former quarry
supplies all Tweeddale.  There is red free stone in the ridge
of Broomieleas, supplying all Tweeddale with pavement flags.

   There is limestone at Carlops, and Whitefield, and Spittle-
haugh, afforded in proportion to their relative situation to
the market, at 10 d. 1 s. and 1 d. per boll of shells, at the
hill.  Two bolls of shells is a good loading for a one horse
cart.  A boll of shells, when slacked, yields from two to
three bolls of lime.

   There is a coal at Carlops and Coalyburn, sold, accord-
ing to situation, at 6 d. and 7 d. per 200 weight at the pit.
The seams are about 4 1/2 feet thick, including a division stone
of 18 inches.

   Fullers earth is found in a small seam below Bridgehouse
bridge over the Lyne, on the east side of the water.

   Marle is found in beds, formed seemingly by oozing springs
from lime-stone, which encrust or petrify moss by depositions
