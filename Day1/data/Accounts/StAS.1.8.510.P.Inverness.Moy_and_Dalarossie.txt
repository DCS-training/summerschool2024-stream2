   Character and Manners.-The inhabitants of these parishes,
however, are, in general, sober, peaceable, and industrious,
Crimes of an atrocious nature are rare among them.  The
climate is rather unfavourable to the constant exercise of in-
dustry, as during the stormy season in winter, and a great part
of spring, they can do little, except taking care of their cattle;
but as soon as the season permits them to labour without doors,
their exertions are very great, until the seed time is over.  In
summer, they are employed in providing fuel, which consists
of peats; and as the climate is unfavourable, on the one hand,
this inconvenience is in a great measure remedied, by the great
plenty of fuel in every part of the parish.  In harvest they are
equally diligent in cutting down and securing their corn, be-
fore the bad weather sets in.-In their manners, they are
remarkably attached to old customs and practices.  The lan-
guage, dress, and most of the peculiarities of the old High-
landers, continue in this place, with very little alteration.  Ex-
cepting the gentry, few of the inhabitants of this place speak
English; nor do they discover much inclination to acquire that
language.  The tartan plaid and kilt, and the other parts of
dress peculiar to the Highlanders, are still in general use
among the men; the women, in like manner, retain the High-
land dress of that fex.  Their houses are of the same con-
struction with those of their predecessors for ages past; and they
still place the fire in the middle of the house, and the fa-
mily sits in the form of a circle around it.
