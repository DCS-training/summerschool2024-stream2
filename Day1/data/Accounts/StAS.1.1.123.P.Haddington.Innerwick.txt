   The decrease of population is owing chiefly to the mono-
polising of farms, and the introduction of two horse ploughs.

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-The men's wages was 5 d.
a-day about 40 years ago; they are now from 10 d. to 1 s.
The women's wages is 6 d. a-day for labouring at hay or tur-
nip.  But there are few day-labourers, most of the people
being employed as hynds or plowmen, lot-men, &c.; all of
whom are paid in grain.  The lot-men thresh for the 25th
boll.  The plowmen receive bolls of different kinds of grain,
frequently amounting in all to L. 18 or L. 20 Sterling.  A
