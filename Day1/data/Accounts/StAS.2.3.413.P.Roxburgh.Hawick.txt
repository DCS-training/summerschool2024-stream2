mortification to L.19, 1s. 11d., and the school-fees on an average
are estimated at L. 90.  L. 17 are also allowed in lieu of a dwel-

   In 1804, the heritors endowed an additional school in the vil-
lage of Newmill, in the landward part of the parish.  The salary
amounts to L. 12, and the school-fees on an average are estimated
at L.18.
  Besides these there are 10 schools carried on by teachers on
their own adventure.  Six of the teachers are females, and in most
of those schools the elementary branches of education are taught,
and at much the same rate as in the parish school.  A subscrip-
tion school was also established a few years ago, which is gradual-
ly progressing.
  There are likewise 24 Sabbath schools on the local system, and
in connexion with the Establishment, besides 4 under the super-
intendence of the Dissenters.
  The following table gives the average numbers attending the
week-day schools in 1835.  It ought, however, to be noticed, that
the numbers that attended more or less through the course of the
year were considerably greater than those stated in the tables it
being found, for example, from the lists of one of the schools which
were kept with great accuracy, that the gross number of children
that attended during any part of the year amounted to 191, whilst
the number in attendance at one and the same time was never more
than 85.

  Individuals brought  up in other parishes are  occasionally met
with, whose education in early life appears  have  been  totally
neglected.  It is not, however, known that there are any of the na-
