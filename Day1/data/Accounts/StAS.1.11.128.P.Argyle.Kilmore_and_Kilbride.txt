tenantry, or lower class of people, are sold from 3 L. 5 s. to
3 L. 10 s. at present*.  The horses are stronger than those in
the North Highlands.  They are exceedingly hardy and fit for
every kind of labour.  Their size is from 12 to 14 hands high;
and they are strongly made.

   Sheep and Swine.-Sheep stocks are but lately introduced
here.  Hitherto they have answered very well.  They are of
the black faced kind, bred in Annandale, and the high grounds
about Moffat.  As they increase in numbers, they contribute
much to wear off the heath; insomuch, that several hills,
covered with it about 30 years ago, have now got a beautiful
surface of grass; although, alas!  at the expence of reducing
the number of the poor farmers; many of the villages being
quite depopulated.  A few persons rear swine, in small num-
bers; but they are not of a good quality.

   Wild Quadrupeds.-Quadrupeds of the wild kind, here, are
such as are common in most parts of the Highlands of Scotland;
a few roes, many hares, of the largest size, wild cats, and a
few badgers and otters, which are numerous.  The foxes are
nearly extirpated.  There are many pole-cats, and beautiful
weasels, besides rats, mice, and moles.

   Birds.-There are moor-fowls, black and red; but not in such
numbers as formerly, owing to burning the heath, and the in-
crease of the sheep.  There are also plovers, wild pigeons, crows,
and rooks; the latter are become so numerous, as to be very
destructive to the grain and potatoes.  Of the migratory kind,
we have wood-cocks, swallows, snipes, a few green plovers,
