sionally insulated by the Tay; and this supposition is fa-
voured by its situation, and by its ancient name, Inch-tuthel,
that is, an "island in a flooded stream."

   Hills and Woods.-The north and west parts of the pa-
rish are hilly, and contain quarries of excellent blue slates,
which are sold on the spot at L. 1 the thousand, and are
carried to a considerable distance.  The higher hills are
covered with heath, mixed with dwarf juniper, the lower
with furze and broom.  They are generally of a rocky ap-
pearance.  Some of the latter are clothed with natural
woods of oak, ash, birch and hazel; others have been
planted with firs, larches, and other forest-trees, of which
large plantations have likewise been formed in the low
part of the parish, within the last 20 or 30 years; but
there is still need of more woods, not only for shelter and
for ornament, but also to supply the inhabitants with fuel
and timber.

   Climate, Distempers, etc.-The air is dry and healthy,
but sensibly different in the N. and S. parts of the parish,
being temperate on the banks of the Tay and the Isla, and
cold and keen on the hills*.  About 50 years ago, the ague
was very prevalent in the plain; but since the marshy
grounds were drained, it has disappeared.  The disorders
mostly to be met with, are hysterical and nervous affections,
consumptions, and worms.  The violent nervous symptoms

*Having been favoured with a state of Fahrenheit's thermometer for
the last 10 years, taken at Delvin, at 11 o'clock at night, I subjoin an ab-
stract of the greatest and least heights.  To this I am enabled to add a
similar abstract of the greatest and least heights taken at the same hour
in Queen-Street, Edinburgh, for the same years.  From these abstracts an
idea may be formed of the general temperature of this climate compared
with that of the capital.  Delvin is in 56 degree 33' North Latitude.
