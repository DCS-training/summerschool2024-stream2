     The number of families in the parish is                     583
     Average number of individuals to each family, including the pa-
       rents, about                                                    4 3/8

   The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50
and upwards residing in the parish is four.
   In the upper district of the parish the Gaelic language is still
partially spoken by the common people; but there are none who
cannot also speak English. The Gaelic is, however, gradually
disappearing: and it is likely that, in a short time, it will be alto-
gether disused.
   The general character of the people, both in a moral and intel-
lectual, and also in a religious point of view, now stands as high,
it is believed, as in any parish similarly situated in Scotland.

	Agriculture.--The strict accuracy of the following returns can-
not altogether be depended on, but they have been made up with
as much correctness as the nature of the information obtained
would admit of.

The number of acres which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage is estimates-

Do. which have been cultivated, and which remain constantly waste or in pas-

    The species of trees most generally planted are larch and Scotch
fir. Of the latter especially, as formerly stated, thereare largeplan-
tations in the southern district of the parish. There are no planta-
tions of hard-wood of any great extent, but there is a considerable
quantity of ash, elm, and beech planted, dither in hedgerows, belts,
or small clumps, and these kinds appear to thrive well. The kinds
