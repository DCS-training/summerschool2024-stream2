tion of the parish minister.  Sir Michael Stewart, Ba-
ronet, of Blackhall, is patron.-The schoolmaster's sala-
ry is 100 merks Scots; and the whole amount of his in-
come, as teacher and session-clerk, is about L. 16 a-year
for which he teaches English at 1 s. 4 d.; writing at 1 s.
6 d.; arithmetic at 1 s. 8 d. a-quarter.  This, with his o-
ther perquisites and salary, amounts only to L. 16, and with
this he maintains a numerous family.  Besides the paro-
chial school, there is one in the village of Gourock, where
the teacher is supported by the wages, without either sala-
ry or house.  Neither of these schools are so well attended
as might be expected, from the number of inhabitants, and
the easy terms on which education is got.-The poors
funds are managed by the session, and consist of L. 400
stock, besides the weekly collections.  Out of this, a little
is allowed to about 34, who are on the roll, consisting of
those unable to work, and of those incapable to earn what
is sufficient to maintain themselves and families.  They re-
ceive from 2 s. to 4 s. 6 d. each a-month.  Besides this,
twice a year the sum of L. 8 or L. 9 is divided among the
most needy, some of whom are not on the list.  The poor
live in their own houses, and none are allowed to beg; but
there are great numbers from other places.

   Roads.-The public road, which runs through this pa-
rish, and leads to Irvine and Ayr, is kept in good repair
by the statute labour.  John Shaw Stewart, Esq; of Gree-
nock, some years ago altered the line of that part which
leads from this to Greenock, consisting of above 5 miles, and
generously executed the whole at his own expense, which
is of great utility to the county.  It is probable, that this,
with the cross roads, which are very bad, will now be
much better by levying, at a certain rate, and applying
the money raised under the direction of trustees, agreeable
