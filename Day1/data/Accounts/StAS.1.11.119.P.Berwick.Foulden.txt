	  Population. - As the records have not been regularly kept,
	  the ancient state of the population cannot be precisely ascer-
	  tained. A considerable village, containing about 60 families,
	  being now reduced to 16 only, is supposed to have diminished
	  the population; and it is the opinion of old residenters, that
	  the number of souls is not so great now, as it was 40 years ago;
	  although, upon comparing the average of baptisms for the
	  last 7 years, with that of the same number of years half a
	  century ago, there appears to be very little difference. Hence
	  some incline to think, that although a number of old people
	  have died, and several others have left the bounds to reside
	  elsewhere, the permanent population is still nearly the same;
	  and the reason they give, is, that several new farms have been
	  erected, with a number of houses, containing many families,
	  which bear a near proportion to the reduction, which has taken
	  place in the village. The former opinion, however, seems
	  nearest the truth, the return to Dr. Webster, in 1755, having

	  Ecclesiastical State.  - The number of Seceders is very in-
	  considerable; so that the people, in general, attend the ordi-
	  nances of religion in  the parish church; which was rebuilt in
	  1786. The manse was built about 14 years before. The stipend,
	  by a late decreet of augmentation, is 56l. 10s. in money,
	  and three chalders and a half of barley and oatmeal, equal
	  parts. There is an allowance of 2l. 10s. for the expences of
