     of Kilmadock or Doune.

   The town consists of one street, of a commodious breadth,
running from the bridge of Ardoch, a considerable distance
west, to a point where the roads from bridge of Teith and
Callander meet.  On this point a very neat market-cross
is erected; and, passing the cross, the streets divide with
the road, each division continuing so far as two bridges
thrown across a small rivulet that runs south to the Teith.
The three streets, thus situated, form exactly the letter Y.
   As formerly mentioned, the situation of Doune is low,
but it is very healthful and dry, being close on the banks
of Teith, and upwards of 40 feet above the run of the wa-
ter.  This neat town stands on excellent ground for build-
ing.  The foundation ishard channel, covered with a coat
of rich earth for gardens; and this continues a consider-
able way north, and about a mile and a half west, the banks
of Teith, forming a neat level spot, whereon stand the two
great cattle markets, held at Michaelmas and Martinmas
annually.
   There is no public building in the town; but a patriotic
gentleman, one of the natives, lately proposed to erect a
town-house for public occasions, with a spire, a bell, and a
clock, and a market-place behind.  The plan is worthy of
the gentleman who proposed it; and, it is hoped, the people
of the place will put it in execution.
   The village of Buchany lies on the Callander road, at the
west end of the plain mentioned above, and below the house
of Cambuswallace, which stands on the funny side of a
gentle rising ground, commanding a view at once extensive,
pleasant, and delightful.  From the top of Cambuswallace
parks, the eye is presented with an endless variety of pic-
turesque objects, comprehending the river Teith, the village
and castle of Doune, the policies of Blair-Drummond, and
Stirling Castle.
