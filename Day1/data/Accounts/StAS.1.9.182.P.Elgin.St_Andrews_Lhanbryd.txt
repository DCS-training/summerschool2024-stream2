mate adapted to pasturage, therefore, during summer and
autumn, cattle markets have been established in some place
of that country every week; crossing the cattle over this
rapid and generally unfordable river, and bringing home
under the night such as may not be sold, is attended by
a most forbidding inconvenience, which it is not necessary
here particularly to describe.  The application of lime as
a manure has of late been practiced in this country, and
much greater quantities of it are now used in building than
in any former age.  Banffshire abounding in limestone and
fuel, furnishes the whole quantity required for both pur-
poses.  Besides hard labour, and much time in loading and
unloading the boat, the freight alone adds a fifth part to the
price.  How far Government may be interested in this
bridge, needs not be here stated; but it may be observed,
that experience hath now proved, that the opening of pro-
per roads, has alone civilized and improved the rudest cor-
ners of the Highlands, while the forts which were erect-
ed there, and are supported at so great expense, have in
this respect been found entirely nugatory; although they
could not be intended for any other purpose in a country
which, nature having interdicted from being the theatre of
war, can only at any period exhibit the scene of a flight
skirmish, or one short engagement.-The easy practicabili-
ty, and the advantages of making a canal through the loch
of Spynie, and the N. W. corner of the parish from Lossie-
mouth, to within a mile of Elgin, navigable without a lock
for any vessel that can get into the harbour, might he point-
ed out.-But it only remains rather to suggest the advan-
tage of establishing a corn-market similar to that of Had-
dington.  The county, at an average, disposes of from
10,000 to 16,000 bolls, by the agency only of 3 or 4
persons, who, in general, purchase by commission from
their correspondents in the south, and they alone are often
