distance of 3 1/4 miles from Cullen.  The whoe of the parish
has never been surveyed; and therefore the number of
acres cannot be precisely ascertained.  partly, however, 
from plans, and partly from computation, it may be stated
at 27,000 acres Scotch measure, and in the following pro-
portions nearly:

   Soil, Surface, and Climate.-In a parish of such extent
there is generally a great variety of soil; and this parish
affords no exception to the general rule.  In one corner the
soil is a light loam, extremely rich, on a bottom of clay; in
another it is thin, but abundantly fertile, on a red mud.
Some places are very sandy, and others clayey; and, in
general, with the exception of what is sandy, an amazing
number of small roundish stones cover the ground.  The
surface is variegated with hills and eminences, streams of
water, and fertile plains.  The Binhill, in the S. E. end of
the parish, is mostly planted with trees.  It is covered with
heath, and of so considerable an altitude as to serve as a land-
mark to the fishers, being perceived by them, according to
their way of reckoning, at full 15 leagues distance.  The hills
of Maud and Adie, Also covered with heath to the top, are
contiguous to it, but of less elevation, and proceed in a
westerly direction to the confines of the parish.  The
greatest part of the parish has a N. W. exposure, and suf-
fers from the storms which blow from that point; but this
inconvenience is greatly over-balanced by a sea coast, in-
cluding its windings, of 12 miles.  The vicinity of the sea, in-
dependent of all its other advantages, serves in some measure
to mitigate the heats in summer, and to lesten, both in point
