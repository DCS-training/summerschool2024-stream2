   Birds, Beasts, etc.-The birds that commonly frequent
the shores of this parish are of the web-footed kind.  The
wild-goose, cormorant, scale-drake,  duckm, teal, widgeon, sea-
magpie, and swanm are rare.  The gulls here are of three
different species.  There are the crane, curlew, plover, half
plover, sandy lark, page plover; of all which only the duck,
scale drake, widgeon and plover, nestle in the parish.  Land
birds, larger than a common sparrow, are the lark, boun-
tain, thrush, fieldsare, starling, blackbird, snipe, quail, land-
rail, partridge, moorfowl, black game.  Rooks and wood-pi-
geons are so nemerous as to be a serious evil to the farmer;
crows and magpies are exceedingly numerous likewise.  Mi-
gratory birds are the lapwing or green plover, cuckoo, blue
and grey swallow, stone-chatter, and night-hawk.  The
lapwing appears in March, the cuckoo in April, swallows
and stone-chatters in April or May, the night-hawk in
May or June:  He makes a chattering noise the whole night,
and lives upon the butterflies or moths that fly about during
the night.  All these disappear in October.  The wood,
cock appears the end of October or beginning of November,
and disappears in February.  The snow-birds appear in
stocks in November or December, as storm sets in, and dif-
appear in February, as the weather turns mild.  The black-
bird was once migratory, but for 10 years past he remains
with us throughout the year.  Wether this indicates that
our climate is grown colder than it was formerly, I will not
pretend to say.  The number of sheep may be about a
l000; of which about 200 are of the Bakewell breed,
the rest of the old Scots sheep, small sized, with short wool,
unequal as to its quality, some of it being fine, and some
of it coarse.  The black cattle may be about 800.  They
