     of Eaglesham.

The small-pox carry off great numbers of children:  but there
is no reconciling the minds of the lower ranks to inoculation.
In 1786, a few children were inoculated, and it seemed to
give pain to the people in general, that they came so well and
easily through.  The thoughts of bringing trouble on their
children, as they call it, with their own hands, outweigh every
argument that can be advanced in its favour.

   Rivers and Mineral Springs.-Several rivulets rise out of
the muirs of Eaglesham, and fall into the river Cart, on the
east side of the parish.  This river takes its rise out of the
muirs of Kilbride and Eaglesham, about four miles south of
the village of Eaglesham; and in its course northwards, di-
vides the counties of Lanark and Renfrew, and this parish
from Kilbride and Carmunnock.-There are two mineral
springs in the parish; the one is of a purgative quality, and
when used in the case of complaints in the stomach, gives im-
mediate relief.  The other is used as a remedy for the muir-
ill in black cattle, and is carried to a great distance for that
purpose.-At Balegich-hill, two miles west of the village,
there have been lately observed, several pieces of the barytes, or
heavy stone.  It is of a reddish colour, and laminated struc-
ture; and is often the matrix of lead.  This circumstance,
joined with other symptoms, render it probable, that there are
silver and lead in that part of the parish.-There are also
found large masses of the osmund stone, which seems to be a
volcanic production.  It stands the strongest heat without
renting, for which reason it is used in building ovens and o-
ther furnaces.

   Number of Proprietors, Farmers, and Inhabitants.-The Earl
of Eglinton is patron and proprietor of the whole parish, except
three small farms in it.  The valued rent is L. 3070:6:8,
