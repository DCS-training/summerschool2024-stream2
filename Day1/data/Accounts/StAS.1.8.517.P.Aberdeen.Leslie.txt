   Diseases:-The molt common diseases are fevers, of the slow
nervous kind; there are not often fatal.  Sometimes inflamma-
tory fevers, attended with putrid symptoms, appear, which
are generally very dangerous.  Many are likewise subject to
rheumatic complaints, and a scrophulous taint of the blood seems
to pervade a pretty large proportion, of the inhabitants of this
and the neighbouring districts owing perhaps to the poor low
diet they use, and the cold damp huts they inhabit.

   Fuel.-The fuel here used is peat and turf; neither of
them good in their kind.  This fuel, from the time and la-
bour it requires, in the best part of the rammer, may be reck-
oned expensive in the most favourable seasons, and has al-
ways been found to retard the improvement of every country,
and the advancement of manufactures, especially where manure
must be brought from a distance.  Could coals from New-
castle or Sunderland be got during summer, at a moderate
price, the advantage to this district would be considerable.
The expence of freight and charges of importation must al-
ways affect this part of Scotland:  But were the heavy duty
on coals removed, the revenue of the kingdom, would soon re-
ceive, from the increasing population and prosperity of the
people, much more than it ever can derive from a tax, which
is one of the greatest obstacles to their advancement.

   Minerals.-In several places, on the south side of the parish,
there is a kind of jasper, or amyanthus, found.  It has a
greenish kind of tinge, with grey streaks interspersed.  The
country people make snuff boxes and other trinkets of it;
but no quarries have been opened, nor blocks of any size
wrought.
