without any resistance, till it gets so near the land, that for
want of a sufficient body of water, it cannot exert its strength,
in disintangling itself from the net, the fishers in the mean
time, take advantage of its situation, and attrack it with sticks
and stones, till they have it secure.  Some of these fish are
very large; many of them have been taken ashore at Loch-
goil head, in the manner now described; there was one in
particular, a few years ago, which measured 28 feet in
lenght, and from which 150 gallons of soil was extracted.
Small whales, and purpoises, make their appearance in sum-
mer, and buckers at all times of the yeat.  Of amphibious
animals, there are none but the seal and the otter, nor are
these very numerous.  A few years ago, a creature of a very
uncommon appearance, was taken ashore in a salmon net at
Loch-long side in this parish; it was of the species called the
sword-fish.  The body of the fish was about nine feet long,
and somewhat rounded; from its nose issued a horn, or hard
bony substance, about three feet long, shaped like a two-
edged sword, and tapering beautifully towards the point,
which with the edges were exceeding sharp.  The year after
this fish was taken ashore, another of the same kind was
caught to shell-fish; there are a few oysters to be got upon the
stones and rocks, and great abundance of muscles, cockles,
wilks, or periwinkles, and some spout-fish.  There is also some
sea-ware, but not in great abundance, owing to the rugged-
ness of the shore; the sea-ware in this country is of an in-
ferior quality, from the great quantity of fresh water in the
lochs.  About 20 tons of kelp may be made yearly.   The
sea-ware is also used for manure; but generally with a mix-
ture of dung.
