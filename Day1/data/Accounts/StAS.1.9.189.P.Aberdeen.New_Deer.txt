tirely of stone; and tenants possessing only a 19 years
lease, cannot be supposed to be at the expense of stone
fences, when they have no allowance or encouragement
for them.  In the last state there is no notice taken of hay

sometimes not more than 500 or 600 yards wide, pouring
down a temporary deluge.  In winter, again, a shower of
snow, instead of rain, frequently passes over a like extent,
and in the same direction.  The physical cause seems to
