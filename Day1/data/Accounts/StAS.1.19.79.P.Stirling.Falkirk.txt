course fall in proportion.  Parish schools have been the great
nurseries of that general knowledge which is so commonly
to be found even among the peasants of Scotland; and from
them some of our most illustrious characters have sprung forth.
But I am afraid, if additional encouragement be not soon
given, that those sources of improvement and wisdom must
soon be abandoned to the direction of the illiterate.  Men
of learning and ability will not chuse to languish in obscu-
rity and indigence, but will seek for employment in some
of the more lucrative situations of civil life; and then the
nation will be prevented from being adorned and improved
by those luminaries, which opportunities of education
would have formed and drawn out to public view.

   Poor.-The number of persons in this parish who are at
one time upon the poors roll, may be estimated at an ave-
rage at somewhat more than 150.  They are supplied with
small sums of money, according to their circumstances,
from 1 s. to 5 s. or 6 s. a month.  The money which is
thus expended on the indigent of this parish arises from
funds belonging to the poor, from offerings at the church-
gates on days of divine service, from other voluntary con-
tributions, and from an assessment which the landholders
annually lay upon themselves of L. 1 Sterling for every
L. 100 Scotch of valued rent in the parish.  As many
persons, from the nature of their property, are little or in
no degree exposed to the assessment, there is an annual,
voluntary and liberal subscription in the town of Falkirk,
and in the villages of the parish.
   There is also in the town of Falkirk an hospital for the
support of four aged and infirm persons.  It was founded
and endowed in 1640 by Lord Livingston of Almond and
Callander.  This deed was amplified and confirmed by him
in the year 1668, after he was created Earl of Callander.
