lies attending the Established church.	There is a small con-
gregation of Independents in the parish, who assemble for public
worship in the upper flat of the minister's dwelling-house. There
are about eight families of this persuasion in the parish,- a few fa-
milies from other parishes also attend. The Independent mi-
nister rents a small farm. There is also a place of worship occa-
sionally visited in summer by licentiates of the United Secession
church. There are no families in the parish who profess to be con-
nected with that body, consequently the congregation is made up
of occasional hearers. There are, however, some individuals who
generally at tend when there is sermon. Only one Roman Ca-
tholic is to be found in the parish.
     Divine service at the Established church is generally well attend-
ed, especially during the summer season; some of the people re-
gularly coming a distance of six or seven miles. A few families
occasionally attend the churches of Aberlour, Rothes, and Inver-
avon, from the greater proximity of these places of worship. The
average number of communicants amounts to 370. The parish_
ioners are almost all well affected towards the Established church,
in proof of which, it may be stated, that petitions to both Houses
of Parliament, praying for the support and extension of the Church
of Scotland, were transmitted in February last, signed by upwards
of 400 male inhabitants of the parish. The sacrament of the
Lord's Supper is dispensed once a-year, previous to which, seve-
ral diets are held for catechising both the advanced and young
communicants. The parishioners are also regularly examined
and catechised once a-year, after the conclusion of the harvest
season. In the year 18lO, four communion cups, and in 1822, two
communion plates were gifted to the kirk-session,- the former by
Mr George Stewart, merchant, Corgyle of Wester Elchies, and
the latter by Mr James Cruickshank, farmer, Bogroy, one of the
elders of the parish. The Earl of Seafield is sole patron.\f*
