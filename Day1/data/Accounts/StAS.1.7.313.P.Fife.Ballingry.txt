advantageous crop; they sow also a mixture of rough bear
and barley, pease and beans and some wheat; but of this last,
very little.  The time of sowing oats is towards the end of
March, or the beginning of April; they sow their bear from
the beginning to about the middle of May.  The rotation
of crops here in general is, after breaking up ground, to
take two crops of oats, and one of bear; with this last crop
they sow grass seeds, and the ground then commonly remains
in grass 3 or 4 years before it is again broke up.  There is,
in this parish, one mill, that of Inchgaw, to which the diffe-
rent estates are bound thirle, that is, must have ground at
that particular mill what quantity of victual is consumed by
the families living on the estate.

Of the above there are 80 Seceders. About 30 years ago, it
appears this parish contained above double the number of in-
habitants, which it does at present.  The obvious cause of
this decrease of population, has been the throwing the prin-
cipal estates into grass farms, which are now in the hands of
a few considerable dealers in cattle.

   Productions.-Although there is a considerable quantity of
grain raised in this parish, yet the soil being better calculated
for grass, the rearing of cattle forms the most considerable
employment of the tenants, and is one of the principal pro-
