	The University Library was founded in the fifteenth century. It
contains an extensive and valuable collection of books, amongst
which are many beautiful editions of the classics. It is always in-
creasing by donations of copies of every new work published in
this country, as well as by books purchased by the fees received
at matriculation, assisted by fees received from graduates, and by
an annual payment from all students, who are entitled to the use
of the library under certain limitations.
	A small botanic garden adjoining the college was prepared for
the use of the lecturer in botany in 1753; but, having from various
causes, become unfit for its purposes, a very valuable botanical gar-
den, consisting of eight acres, was formed in the neigbourhood of
the city, by the citizens of Glasgow. The University subscribed
L.2000 towards its erection, for the privilege of their Professor of
Botany lecturing in the hall in the garden, and Government has sub-
sequently given a similar sum in support of it. This garden, which
was opened in the spring of 1818, is, for-the variety of rare plants
from almost every part of the world, not exceeded by any botanical
garden in the kingdom.
	The founder of the Hunterian Museum was the celebrated Wil-
liam Hunter, M. D. who was born in the parish of East Kilbride, in
the neighbourhood of Glasgow, in 1710. By his will in 1781, he be-
queathed to the Principal and Professors of the College, his splen-
did collection of books, coins, paintings, anatomical preparations,
&c. and appropriated L. 8000 for the erection of a building for
their reception. The collection is valued at L. 65,000, viz. medals,
L.30,000, books, L. 15,000, pictures, L. 10,000, miscellaneous,
L.10,000. The collection has been considerably increased of late
years. The public are admitted every lawful day, on payment of 1s.
	There are twenty-seven bursaries connected with the College,
varying from L. 5 to L. 40. They are held from four to six years.
Besides these, there are two very valuable exhibitions.  In the year
