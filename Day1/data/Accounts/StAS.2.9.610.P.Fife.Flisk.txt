himself, during the winter. In summer, it grazed along with the
farmer's own cattle. The goadmen, who were young, and also
the horse herd, who was generally older, lived in their master's
house.
About seventy years ago, the crops raised were not so varied as
now, and the system of agriculture was different; oats, barley, and
peam were what were gail generally sown. There was no cultivated
grass and no turnip or potato. Turnip was first introduced by
Mr Barclay on Pittachop farm, about fifty-eight years ago. By
1792 (as appears from the former Account) a considerable quan-
tity of wheat was grown, about 190 acres; but now, it has increased
to 290 acres. A field of 15 acres contained barley and oats, for
twenty-two,-xears in succession.
   At the middle of last, century, or even later, the rental does not
seem to have been from one-tenth to one-sixth of what it is now;
and even forty years ago, probably not much above one-fourth.
This, however, is to sonto extent only apparent, as the nominal va-
lue of many other things has undergone corresponding relative
change. Part of the rent was paid in grain and meal. A house,
now the farm-house of Fliskmill, was formerly the girnal for the
Ballinbreich estate. The meal would sometimes accumulate to
600 cwt. before it was sold.
The first two-story farm house was built only sixty-one years
ago (in 177'6.) All the accommodation the farmer had before, was
his "but" and "ben."'
The chief improvements of which the parish seems susceptible,
are increased draining and enclosing; tbe erection of a greater
number of cottages; planting the uncultivated lands; and the
erections of a pier for the shipment of grain and the easier landing of
lime and coal, &c. and for rendering the Perth and Dundee
ateuners available for the convenience of the inhabitants.
