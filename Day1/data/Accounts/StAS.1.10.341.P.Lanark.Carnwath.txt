tablishing a woollen manufactory, was any person of spirit and
capital to engage in that branch of bussiness.
   Some of the intelligent farmers are now sensible of their
mistake, in allowing their cott-houses to fall into ruins; for
although the rent of these houses was not an object of impor-
tance, yet they were the nursery of the servants both male and
female that were wanted in the country.  By allowing these
houses to go to ruin, the poor inhabitants are removed to the
manufactoring towns, and the farmers find it exceedingly dif-
ficult to procure workmen to carry on the necessary bussiness
of the farms.
