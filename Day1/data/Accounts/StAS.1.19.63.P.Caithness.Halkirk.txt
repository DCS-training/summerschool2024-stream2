   Farms.-The farms in this parish are of great variety
with respect to rent or tack-duty, ascending through vari-
ous degrees, From L. 2 to L. 200.  Those of them that fall
under the description of too large tacks or farms, are cer-
tainly a great bane to industry and population, and the ne-
cessary causes of many inconveniencies to subtenants; and
it is equally certain, that the advantages arising from them
either to the tacksman or the proprietor, are imaginary and
delusive, and terminate in the prejudice of the interest of
both.  But how happens this?  Why, the tacksman, who is
not able to labour but a very small part of the tack him-
self, and founds his credit and support on what he can
make of the subtenants, this tacksman, in order to keep
credit with the proprietor, and to support his family, im-
poses, and perhaps of necessity, heavy burdens on the sub-
tenants, by which they are in the end disabled to keep
credit with this tacksman.  The proprietor, by the rent
he exacts from the tacksman, will reduce him in the end
to bankruptcy, if he has no other shift; and if he shoul
have such shifts, it is odds but he must pay for these also,
as soon as they are perceived.  Thus, the great evil origi-
nates with the proprietor, though perhaps undesignedly.
Yet I will not stand forth in the vindication of these large
tacksman.  They themselves are much to blame, either by
raking tacks, which oblige them to distress others and
themselves; or, if they hold their tacks on reasonable
terms, by oppressing their subtenants, not from motives of
necessity, but from motives of gain, and to make them-
selves easy at their expence.
   And, as too large farms are great evils, for the reasons
above stated, so, on the other hand, too small ones are no
less so, for other reasons no less important.  They are too
inadequate to the burden they have to support, even when
