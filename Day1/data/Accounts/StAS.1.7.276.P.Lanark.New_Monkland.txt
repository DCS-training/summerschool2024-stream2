will be of the greatest benefit to the country in general, and
this parish in particular.

   Population.-The village, or, as it is commonly called, the
town of Airdrie*, is the only one in the parish, and stands
near the south-west extremity, on a beautiful rising ground,
between two small rivulets, regularly bruit, with wide streets,
and extends near an English mile in length from east to west.
It had very few inhabitants at the beginning of the present
century; but they are much increased since.  In the year
1760, there were only 300 examinable persons; in the year
1789 they amounted to 1100; and from an actual survey, ta-
ken this present year, (1792), there are 1762 souls in the
town and suburbs.  The number of souls, in the landward
part of the parish, is not exactly known; but in the year
1789, there were found to be 1300 persons above 8 years of
age, members of the church of Scotland, besides dissenters.
Adding, therefore, these numbers together, with that of the
children below 8 years of age, (who will amount to about
500 more), it is evident, that the population of the whole
parish cannot be less than 3560, which is 847 more than it
was 40 years ago, the return to Dr Webster, in 1755, being
only 2713.
   The following table will give a concise view of the state of
the population, as well as of the different employments of
the inhabitants:

*It was, by act of Parliament, in the year 1695, erected in-
to a market town, with the privilege of holding a weekly mar-
ket an Tuesday, and two fairs annually, the one on the third
Tuesday of May, and the other on the first Tuesday of Novem-
ber, O. S.  A Lammas and Candlemas fair have been added
to the number, but the two old fairs are best frequented.
