                                 WICK.

          Navigation.-A little trade has been carried on from the port
        of Wick from very early times. In 1588, Alexander Earl of
        Sutherland burnt the town of Wick, and spoiled the ship and
        plundered the goods of Andrew Wardlaw, a merchant.
          In 1840, twenty-one ships were registered at the port of Wick,
        amounting to 1154 tons. The tonnage of the ships which have
        entered this port for the last twenty years may have been about
        30,000 tons annually; and the yearly number of sailors about
        3000.
          A steam-boat began to run from Wick to Leith in 1833, once
        a fortnight. The Sovereign steam-boat of 200 horse-power, which
        commences for the season in March, and is laid up in November,
        makes a voyage, once a week, between Lerwick, Kirkwall, Wick,
        Aberdeen and Leith. It carries passengers, stock, and goods;
        and has been of the greatest advantage, not to Wick only, but to
        Caithness, Orkney, and Shetland. Two smacks ply, each once
        a fortnight, between and Leith. There is at Wick a Chamber of
        Commerce.

          Market-Town.--Wick is the market-town of this parish. It is
        a place of great antiquity; and was at the request of the Earl of
        Caithness, of whose earldom it formed a part, erected into a royal
        burgh on the 25th of September 1589. The superiority of it has
        been bought and sold by the Sinclairs of Caithness, the Glenor-
        chys, the Sinclairs of Ulbster, and the Sutherlands; but the Re-
        form Bill has reduced this once potential privilege to feebleness.
        It is, therefore, now little valued. The set of the burgh con-
        sists of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and
        seven councillors. There are no corporations or crafts in this
        burgh, At Michaelmas 1755, the number of burgesses amount-
        ed to 53; at the same term in 1801, to 29; and in 1832, when
        the roll was last made up, to 66. About 15 have since, been ad-
        ded. The dues payable on the admission of a burgess amount to
        L.4, 4s.
           In 1660, the customs were let at L.55 Scots; in 1086, at
        L.63, 10s. The ordinary revenue for 1840, was,
               Rent of customs,                                            L.30  0 0
