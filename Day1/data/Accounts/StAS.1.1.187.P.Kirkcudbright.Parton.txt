   A few years ago, a man died above 90, who, about 8
mouths before his death, got a complete set of new teeth,
which he employed till near his last breath to excellent purpose.
He was four times married, had children by all his wives,
and at the baptism of his last child, which happened not a
year before his death, with an air of complacency expressed
his thankfulness to his Maker for having "at last sent him
"the cled score," i.e. 21.

   Church and Stipend.-The church, situated within 200
yards of the river, is remarkable for little else than its
darkness and disproportion, being 65 feet long, and 14 1/2
broad.  The pulpit is of solid oak, curiously carved, and
bearing date 1598.  The manse, rebuilt in 1777, had addi-
tions and repairs in 1789, and is now large and commodious.
The stipend is L. 83: 6: 8; the manse and glebe L. 10.
