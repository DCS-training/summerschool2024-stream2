whin stone of which they are built.  It was anciently the 
property and chief residence of the powerful family of the 
Frasers, first proprietors of Oliver castle, and afterward of a 
great part of the lands from that to Peebles, and sheriffs of 
the country; and from whom spring the families of Lovat and 
Saltoun, in the N.  The last of that family, in the male line, 
in Tweeddale, was the brave Sir Simon Fraser, who in 1303,

and that they have been enlightened with the gospel from a 
still more ancient period; and that in after ages they received 
from the kings of Scotland, many expressions of royal re-
gard and munificence.  The first teachers of Christianity in

the former teachers of heathenism, the Druids, and taught 
the religion of the true God and our Saviour in much purity 
and simplicity for some centuries.  When the ambitious bishops 
of Rome, in succession to the emperors, formed their design 
of universal empire, various religious orders were instituted, 
and various religious houses were built and endowed, in this, 
as in the other nations in Europe, to increase the votaries,
