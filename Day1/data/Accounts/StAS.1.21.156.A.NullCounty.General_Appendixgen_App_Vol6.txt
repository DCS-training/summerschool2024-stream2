unproductive.  The crop that had occupied this mould when
the trees were selled is found still entire.  It consists chiefly
of heath: but several other smaller plants are also very dis-
tinguishable.
   Immediately above this stratum lies the moss, to the height,
upon an average, of seven feet.  It is composed of different
vegetables arranged in three distinct strata.  Of these the first
is three feet thick.  It is black and heavy, and preferable to
the others for the purpose of fuel.  It consists of bent-grass
(agrostis) which seems to have grown up luxuriantly among
the trees after they were felled.  The second stratum also is
three feet thick.  It is composed of various kinds of mosses,
but principally of bog-moss (sphagnum.)  It is of a fallow or
iron colour, and remarkably elastic.  It is commonly called
white peat; and for fuel is considered as much inferior to that
above mentioned.  The third stratum is composed of heath
and a little bent-grass, but chiefly of the deciduous parts of
the former.  It is about a foot thick, and black.
   Three strata of different vegetables lying above each other,
the limits of each distinctly marked, and each distinguished
by a different colour, is certainly a curious natural phenome-
non.
   An enquiry will here occur, What has occasioned this suc-
cession in the vegetables of which the moss is composed?
   Every vegetable has a particular soil, more or less moist,
peculiarly adapted to its nature.  Let a piece of ground be in
a moist state, rushes will introduce themselves; drain the
ground sufficiently, the rushes will disappear, and finer vege-
tables will succeed.  it seems reasonable to account for the
succession of the different plants that compose the moss on
similar principles.
   Let us imagine an extensive plain covered with trees lying
in all directions, full of branches, and possibly loaded with
