     Statistical Account

a prospect too vast, and crowded with objects, for particu-
lar or critical remark.  From this advantageous spot of
observation, the various powers of taste which adorn the
mind of man are called forth, and pleasantly engaged in
contemplating lofty mountains, verdant hills, fruitful plains,
beautiful rivers, populous towns, great woods, three re-
nowned castles, and a peep of the German Ocean.  Under
the spectator's eye from this place the parish of Roxburgh
lies fully displayed, and forms an excellent landscape, the
Tweed washing its border on the north, and Teviot partly
on the south.  A rich angle, all inclosed*, lying on the
south-east side of Teviot, adds much to the beauty of 
whole.

   Curiosities.-Among the curiosities in this parish, two
well-springs, on the banks of the Tweed, of a petrifying
quality, are remarkable.  One of these is but a feeble
spring, and being in the midst of marshy ground, is not very
perceptible.  The moss around it, however, is all incrusted
considerably.  More plentiful in its source, the other
spring produces a more powerful effect.  It seems to drip
through a solid rock; but upon near inspection, that rock
appears plainly to be a petrified substance.  The powers of
the water are so strong, as to crust a bit of moss, or any ca-
pillary substance, within the space of three months, and
render it hard as solid ice in the course of half a year.  A
little below this a stratum of rock (by miners called a dike)
runs across the river, and forms a great natural curiosity.
The rock is divided into four slits, which contain the
Tweed when not in flood.  Two of these are about 34 feet
deep, and so narrow that one may easily step across them.
In summer, people a-foot used often to pass the river here;
