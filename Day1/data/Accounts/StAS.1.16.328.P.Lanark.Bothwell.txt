     Statistical Account

   Woodball,-the seat of Walter Campbell, Esq; of Shaw-
Field.  It is situated on the banks of the water of North
Calder, about five miles north-east from the church.  The
house is large, with some noble apartments, and a good
library.  The inclosures and plantations are numerous and
extensive.  Two avenues from the great road to Edin-
burgh, from the east and west, each about a mile and a
half in length, passing through belvideres and funk fences,
form a fine approach.  It has lately received a complete
melioration from the present proprietor.  A beautiful
piece of water has been formed, upon the banks of which
modern gardens, peach-house, vineries, and orangery, are
built to a great extent.  Pleasure-walks are made along the
banks of the Calder, and both sides ornamented with plant-
ing.  The Monkland canal adds to the scenery, and will
advance the value of the coal in the estate.  The fields have
been laid down in great order; plantations thinned; fine
vistas opened; and a more elegant and cheerful aspect
given to the whole.  Few places in the west of Scotland
are upon a more liberal scale; few gentlemen understand
the improvements and interests of their country better
than the proprietor, or have done more than he upon his
several seats.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-Beauty of Clydesdale, or Fine
Prospects.-There are many of these in the parish.  One
is, the view from the west point of the village of Udding-
ston, down the river.  It terminates upon Daldowie, where
nature, aided by an excellent taste, has formed one of the
most beautiful places upon Clyde.
   But there is another prospect which merits particular
notice.  It is the east brow of the hill, upon which the vil-
lage of Bothwell stands.  This seems to be the great pro-
montory which nature has erected to contemplate the beau-
