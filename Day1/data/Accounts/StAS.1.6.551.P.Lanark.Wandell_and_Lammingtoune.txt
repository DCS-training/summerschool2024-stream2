or more.  Devonshaw is the same with Woodend in the
Celtic.  And Hartside may be so named from Harts, which
animals may have been formerly plentiful in the woods, which
then abounded.-The trees now remaining in Lamington, there
being few or none in Wandel, are principally the beech, ash,
elm, alder, plane, and fir.-There are no thorn hedges here
except in the glebes of Wandel and Lamington, in the ridges
adjoining to the latter in the high road below Loanhead, and
about yards and gardens.  For this neglect two reasons are
given, first, that the hedges gather flocks of birds, to eat up
the grain; and secondy, that when the grounds are inclosed
there is not so much open air, to wind their corn after it is cut
down, and to make it ready to be led into the barn yard, in a
country like this, incompassed about with hills and high
grounds, and consequently liable to wet weather*.
   There is a beautiful and pleasant spot of ground situated
on the Clyde, at Whitehill, improved at a great expence, by
drains in a long and straight ditch set about with willows about
a mile or upwards.-There is scarcely a garden, which de-
serves the name, as being almost without flowers, and having
little or no fruits excepting gooseberries, currants, and black-
berries.-Not only the farm houses have a small spot of
ground on which are set plants and herbs, but also every cot-
tage almost has a kail yard.

   Extent, Rent, etc.-The acres in the barony of Lamington
are about 4000; and in that of Wandel about 5000, in all
9000.  There are about 3000 of the former, and above 4000
of the latter, in high grounds, for pasture of sheep, in gras-

*These two reasons seem to be unquestionably ill founded, as the hedges
many be well pruned, and kept sufficiently thin and low, with some labour,
which would be abundantly recompensed by defending the grounds from the
encroachment of sheep and other cattle, to which they may be exposed.
