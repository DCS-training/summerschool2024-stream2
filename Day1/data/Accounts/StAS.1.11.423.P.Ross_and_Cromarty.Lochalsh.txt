   Surface, Soil, and Climate, etc.-The general appearance
of the country, like that of all Highland parishes, is moun-
tainous.  The hills are neither rocky, nor covered with
heath, as in the neighbouring countries to the N. On the
declivity of the smaller hills, and in the intermediate hollows,
the soil is rich, and commonly of the same quality with the
ground which covers lime-stone rocks.  On the top they are
covered with thin moss.  The whole produces excellent pa-
sture, reckoned superior in quality to any in the neighbour-
ing countries.  The climate, as may be expected, from the
attraction of the clouds by the high hills in the parish, and
the still higher hills of Kintail and Sky, is exceedingly moist
and rainy.  The inhabitants, however, are healthy, and many
live to a considerable age.  Nervous fevers are the principal
epidemical distempers to which they are subject.

   Produce.-The produce of the country is oats, barley, po-
tatoes and pease.  But the attention of the farmer being
principally occupied in rearing cattle, the raising of corn be-
comes a secondary consideration.  The inequality of the sur-
face renders cultivation difficult, and the wetness of the climate
makes the return precarious.  In the best seasons it does not
produce corn sufficient for the inhabitants.  They annually
import oat-meat from Ireland, the Frith of Clyde, or Caith-
ness, at from 15 s. to 24 s. per boll, of 8 stone Dutch weight.
The quantity varies, according to the goodness of the harvest,
or the severity of the spring.  In a bad spring, the cattle often
consume their corn after the provender has been exhausted.

   Cattle.-The number of cattle in the parish, according to
a very accurate survey lately taken, is as follows:
