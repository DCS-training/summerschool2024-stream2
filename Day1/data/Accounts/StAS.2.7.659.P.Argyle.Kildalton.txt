ofDivine things, they cannot convey correct ideas of moral obli-
gation, or of relative duties, or of the place which personal labour
holds in the scheme of God's moral government.  Idly disposed,
and exhibiting a conduct governed by prejudices handed down
from past generations, they not only do not contribute to the
means of supporting the family, but they do not use judiciously or
economically what is committed to their trust, nor easily adopt the
suggestions of persons who are better informed. It is anticipated,
that, as these habits and feelings give way to the force of Scrip-
tural education, the comfort, morals, and happiness of the labour-
ing classes will be promoted.

                   Parish of Kildalton
            Presbytery Of Islay, Synod of Argyle.

     I.-Topography And Natural History.
  Name.-Tradition says that this parish derives its name from
a step-son of one of the Macdonalds of the Isles, a young man of
great promise, who was killed in early life, and who was buried
in the parish church. Kildaltan, or Kildalta, signifies the bury-
ing-pace of a step-son or foster-son.
    Exten, &c.-The parish extends along the south-east side of the
Island of Islay. It is about 24 miles in length, and 7 in breadth.
Is is bounded on the north-east by the Sound of Islay, and on the
south-west, by the Atlantic Ocean. The centre of the parish is
nearly of an equal breadth, but it becomes considerably narrower
towards each end. There is a range of hills extending along the
centre in a paralle course with the sides, which gradually be-
come higher as they approach the Sound of Islay. Their height,
as far as I understand, has never been ascertained. Benvigory
