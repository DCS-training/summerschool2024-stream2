hill, running from north to south throughout the whole
breadth, which afterwards being directed eastward, is the
boundary between Bower and Watten.
   This parish is, in general, flat and low lying; and, like the
rest of the shire of Caithness, can hardly be said to have hills

which almost equally divides the parish, betwixt Bower Tower
and Brabster, to the west of the kirk, is a large stone, about
8 feet above ground, called Stone Lude or Lutt, perhaps from

have been a place of Pagan worship.  Besides several tumuli,
