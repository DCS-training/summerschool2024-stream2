   Sea Fight.-The only sea fight spoken of as having ta-
ken place near this shore, is that of Commodore (now Ad-
miral) Elliot, in the year 1700, when that brave and ex-

rock by the vessel as she sunk.  The tide having retired,
and the men getting upon the beach, their next effort was
to ascend a precipice between them and the country.  In
making this effort, after so much fatigue, nature was so far
exhausted in them, that one of their number dropped down

   The escape of these men appears very wonderful, and
can only be ascribed to the watchful providence of God.
The rock, upon which they remained for some hours, beat
upon by a heavy rain and violent wind, is of a conical
form, 70 feet high and upwards; and about two yards, or
two yards and a half, broad at the top.  How they clung
