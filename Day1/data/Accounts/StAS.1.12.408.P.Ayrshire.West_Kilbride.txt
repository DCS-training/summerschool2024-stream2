scourging crops of oats; then let it rest as before; next suc-
ceed the 2 ploughings; and so on, in this rotation.
   For the other 2 soils mentioned, lime is certainly exceed-
ing proper; but very strong prejudices were long entertained
against it.  When the present incumbent entered to his charge,
there was not an ounce of lime laid upon land within the
parish, and no reasoning could prevail with the farmers to
try it:  they pleaded their ignorance of its operation, the me-
thod of applying it, and the great expense attending the con-
veyance of it from a distant kiln.  But, whether from ob-
serving the great advantages arising from it in neighbouring
parishes, where it hath been long introduced, or that they
are subjected to certain regulations by the late leases, or
from the more enterprising spirit of some new proprietors, a
mighty change has taken place in the people's ideas with re-
gard to lime, in consequence of which, vast quantities of it
have been laid upon the land within these 3 years; greater in-
deed, in proportion to the extent of the parish, than any
other within the county.  This gives ground to hope, that a
better method of husbandry, though yet in its infancy, will,
in a few years, from perseverance, and the influence of a 
laudable example, become more general*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The prejudices of the people, are not the only hinderance to the progress
of agricultural improvements in this parish.  One local disadvantage which it
labours under, must have contributed much to retard them, and that is, that
there is neither coal nor lime-stone to be found within itself; though pains have
been taken to discover them, and attempts made to sink pits for that purpose.
And what renders the only expedient for supplying this defect, more embarras-
sing is, the duty upon coals carried coastways, and even to places within the
precincts of the same port, and where the coal-works are situated.  This hath
discouraged farmers from bringing lime-stone by water, from Arran, and the
greater Cumbray, where it is to be had in abundance, because, though it might
be procured from those places, at no great charge, there is no coal to burn it
with, but what must be fetched at an extraordinary expense.  The barbarous
