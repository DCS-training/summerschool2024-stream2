*Wages, etc.-Men servants are 2 sorts, married and unmarried.
The yearly wages of unmarried servants are from L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, be-
sides shoes.  Young lads, from 12 to 14 years, have from L. 1 to L. 2;
and an unmarried grieve, from L 5 to L. 6.  The married servants have
the price of their labour paid them in quite a different manner.  Each of
them has a milch-cow, with its followers, ranging with his master's cows
throughout the year with grass for a few sheep; he has the labouring of
some ground, which is carried on at the master's expense, and which
produces about 3 bolls meal, besides some potato ground, which yields
from 8 to 10 barrels.  A married grieve has grass for 3 or 4 milch cows,
with their followers, as also grass for some sheep, besides the labouring
of so much ground, as will yield from 6 to 10 bolls meal, besides pota-
toes.  The married servant has also 5 bolls meal yearly for his mainte-
nance. and a free house, and fuel.  The unmarried servants are much
cheaper; but on account of the common people's early marriage, they
are very few in number, which is the only cause why masters hire such as
have families.  There are no labourers to be had for day's wages, so that
