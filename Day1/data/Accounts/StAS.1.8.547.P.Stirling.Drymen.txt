     of Drymen.

   Extent.-It is extremely difficult to give an accurate idea
of the situation of this parish, as it is of great extent, and
its outlines are exceedingly irregular.  The utmost length of
the inhabited part is about 15 miles; but the moors extend
considerably farther.  The greatest breadth is about 9 miles.

   Surface, Rivers and Fish.-In some places, the country is
rugged and mountainous; in others, flat and level; but, for
the most part, it is an irregular slope, between the high
moors and the rivers, cut up by a great number of small,
but rapid streams.  The principal rivers, are, the Duchray,
the Forth, and the Enrick.  The Duchray is one of the most
considerable branches of the Forth, and divides this parish, for
some miles, from that of Aberfoil.  Near the church of
Aberfoil, it joins another considerable stream; and the united
river is then known by the name of Forth.  Previous to
their confluence, the parish of Drymen leaves them at a con-
siderable distance; but afterwards joins the Forth, near Gart-
more, about 5 miles to the S. E., where the winding course
of that river, for some miles; divides it from that of Port.
The Enrick takes its rise in the hills of Dundaff, about 15
miles from Drymen, to the eastward.  It separates this parish
from that of Killearn, and afterwards runs through it for
about 2 miles.  It then forms the boundary between this and
the neighbouring parish of Kilmaronock; and, about 4 miles
farther on, discharges itself into Lochlomond.  These rivers
abound in trouts, par, perch, pike, eels, and flounders, with
some salmon.

   Soil.-In such an extent, there must necessarily be a great
diversity of soil.  The banks of the Forth are, in general,
covered with a deep moss; but, where that is removed, the
industry of the farmer is rewarded, by a very rich clay, pro-
