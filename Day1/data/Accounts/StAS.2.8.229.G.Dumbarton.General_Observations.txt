                      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

                    ON THE COUNTY OF DUMBARTON.*/f
                             ____________

  Name.--Dunbar or Dumbar, and Dunbarton or Dumbarton,
have long been celebrated in "Scottish story," as national fortres-
ses of great antiquity and strength, and from analogy, might both
be plausibly derived from the same Celtic radicals, Dun and Bar,
which by interpretation mean a "fort or stronghold on a summit
or height."  This is unquestionably the origin of Dunbar on the
Frith of Forth, but the Dunbar-ton on the Frith of Clyde is sup-
posed to be a corruption of Dun-briton, the "fort of the Britons,"
also formerly called, according to Morris and othes, Alclud or
Alcluid. In examining the Acts of Parliament published by
authority of Government, we find the name frequently rendered
Dunbretane, more frequently Dunbertane and Dunbartan, but lat-
terly chiefly Dumbarton or Dunbarton, so that no conclusion can
be drawn from "use and wont" in favour of either of the above
etymologies. But be this as it may, the town and fort, which have
given their name to the county, are of great antiquity, and evident-
ly bear the impress of the language of the earliest inhabitants of
these northern isles. This district is also occasionally known by
the name of Lenox, which is a corruption of Leven-ach, "a field
or district on the Leven," by which latter term we are to under-
stand not merely the water of Ieven; but also Loch Lomond, for-
merly called Loch Leven, which stretches along a large portion
of the eastern boundaries of the county, and also washes with its
pure and limpid wave many parishes in Dumbartonshire to the
south. The Lenox family, now extinct, but represented by the
Duke of Richmond, derived their name from the same origin,
according to the practice of our forefathers, who named great dis-
tricts and great families after each other.
