neighbours.  In the village of East Salton, there is a weekly
market, where the different kinds of butcher meat are sold,
of excellent quality, and at moderate prices.  They are in
the vicinity too of excellent coal, sold at the pit for 3 1/2 d. per
load of 2 cwt.  The water in the parish is extremely salubri-
ous, running over a bed of limestone.  It is at all seasons un-
commonly cool, and is reckoned peculiarly proper for culi-
nary purposes.-Near the house of Salton is a mineral spring,
the properties of which have been only discovered within
these 12 years.  In the opinion of an eminent physician, to
whom it was shown, it is in no respect inferior to the medi-
cinal waters of Bristol, possessing the same qualities, as the
water of these celebrated wells; it is without smell, peculiar-
ly soft, pleasant, and agreeable to the taste, and has been
kept for years in a corked bottle, without any sensible loss of
its properties.  Salton affords an advantageous situation for
the establishment of manufactures.  Fuel and provisions are
cheap; and the rivers Salton and Tyne afford a range of two
miles, very convenient for the erection of such manufactures
as require being conducted by water.  It is within 6 miles
also of a good sea port, where the manufactures might be ship-
ped to any quarter of the globe.
