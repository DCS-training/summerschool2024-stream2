used, unless the price be very high.  Except these two
kinds, every other is very expensive in manufacturing, and
produces but little kelp.  The quantity of kelp made in
the parish, varies according to the price it draws.  When 
the price was high, and every kind of sea-ware used,
there were from 130 to 150 tons made annually; but the
price falling greatly in 1791, there were not probably 70
tons made the following year in the whole parish.  Then
the price was so low, and the wages of manufacturers so 
high, that, in many parts, even the button wrack was
used for manure.  The price of no commodity in the
country varies so much as that of kelp.  It sometimes
rises to 8 L. the ton, and sometimes falls as low as 50 s.
Various reasons are assigned for the late fall in the price
of kelp; such as kelp imported from foreign countries,
and other substitutes used now where kelp was used for-
merly.  The buyers also complained, that, in manufac-
turing the kelp, stones and sand were mixed with it,
which, besides the loss of weight to the buyers, hurt also
the quality of it.  Though this abuse was by no means
carried to the height complained of by the buyers, and
only by a few individuals, yet it undoubtedly affected
the price of kelp.  The buyer, however, ought to ob-
serve, that sand sticks to the sea-ware, and that some
stones will mix with it in the manufacturing kilns, in
spite of all the care and attention of the manufacturers.
The Duke of Argyll, upon being informed of this com-
plaint, gave or ers to his chamberlain to intimate to his
Grace's tenants, and all the kelp manufacturers upon his
estate, that whoever was found guilty of adulterating
the kelp, would find no shelter upon his estate, and that
they would be prosecuted and punished as far as the law
would admit.  This will have a good effect upon his
