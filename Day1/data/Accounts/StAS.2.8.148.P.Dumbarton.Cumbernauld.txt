                            III.--POPULATION.

                            1791,    1600

            The number of families, 700, gave 4 1/4 to a family, or 4 3/8 nearly.
               During the seven years ending with 31st December 1838,
                  the average of marriages was         33 2/7
               Births,                                 79 6/7
               Burials,                                58 6/7
   The chief employment of the people is cotton weaving, there
being above 560 weavers' looms in the parish, or nearly one-fifth
of the whole population. Some time ago, weaver's work was hardly
to be obtained. At present, work is plentiful, but the prices are
small: upon an average, the weaver's weekly earnings will not ex-
ceed 5s. or 6s. clear; and considering the price of provisions, and
how few are of provident habits, many must be suffering privations.
Indeed, the fluctuating nature of the cotton trade, and the small
remuneration, have induced many of the weavers to relinquish the
loom, and have recourse for employment to the coal and ironstone
mines.
   The above, with otherd causes, some of them of a political na-
ture, have produced unquestionably very great changes in the
moral character and habits of the people,-not for the better, itis
much to be feared; and has hindered them from prizing as they
ought, and, therefore, from giving to their children, that education
which once was the pride and the honour of the people of Scot-
land. The natural effect of this is, that though few are unable
to read, yet thet are allowed to grow up in comparative ignorance
or religion and its duties; and hence may be dated the decline of
morality,-disinclination to religion and to religious duties,-ne-
glect and disregard of the Sabbath and of Sabbath institutions,-
the increase of profanity and crime, and, of late years, the increas-
ing magnitude of the criminal calendar. Notwithstanding of this,
and though we have some turbulent spirits among us,-and it is
to be regretted that this class seems upon the increase,-still the
character of our population generally is quiet and orderly, in the
midst of their many privations.
   The principal exception from this general character, consistent
