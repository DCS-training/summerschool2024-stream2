and is next in bigness to the last mentioned, I mean the
water or river of Forss.  It is a very rapid and dangerous
water, especially in time of speat, abounds with excellent
trout, and a considerable number of salmon are fished in it
every year; a few years ago there was a very good bridge
built upon it, at a place in the parish of Reay, and very
few waters in the country need it more.

   Hills and Mountains.-Having in some measure antici-
pated the article of hills or mountains, in my observations
on the soil and climate, very little may be said of them
here.  The only hill that is anywise worthy of notice, is
that of Spittal.  The summit of it is 4 miles from the
nearest bank of the river Thurso, from whence there

burst on his view at once, and overwhelm him with sur-
prise and transport; nor is he less delighted when he be-
holds the whole country exposed in all its varieties, as it were,
in a map, to his eye, looking down from this elevated
centre on the grand subjacent and circumjacent objects.  It
is I believe 7 miles distant from the north shore, 12 miles
from the east shore, and 14 from the north-west shore,
ving a gradual, gentle ascent from these shores, with the
interruption of some small hills or rising grounds.  Its pre-
cise height I cannot determine, having neither the opportu-
nity nor the instruments proper for taking it.  The name
