attended with inconveniences to all.  The time consumed in
preparing and leading it, which is so great a hindrance to
the business of farming, with the distress occasioned by the
frequent difficulty, or rather impossibility, of preparing it
properly in so rainy a climate, render it highly desirable that
the partial and oppressive tax on coals were repealed.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The circumstances advan-

parts of the Highlands, though not till it has drained the
