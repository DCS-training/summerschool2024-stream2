wider and more beautiful prospects, till at the upper extremity the
whole scene bursts upon the eye with grandeur and effect which
might be transferred to the canvass of the most accomplished ar-
tist without alteration, or addition to its parts. In the fore-ground
are the deep woods with the stream winding far beneath at the
outlet of the valley appears the venerable castle-as if guarding the
entrance into the enchanted scene--farther in the distance is seen
the wide expanse of cultivated landscape that lies between the ob-
server and the Pentland hills;--and lastly, those lovely hills them-

phenomenon to intimate, with what living energy it once embraced
the solid rock beneath--and what strength still remains to even
amidst the decrepitude of age, as a remnant of the surpassing and
gigantic might of its years of youthful or of matured vigour.
   Vogries House is the seat of a proprietor whose possession ex-

portion of the parish.  The house is of a kind, which is frequently
met with a situation where external ornament did not seem to

--high walled--evedently built with no view to a very extended
duration, with no presentension to architectural embellishment
The late properietor, however, had it in contemplation to build a
