     Statistical Account

-I shall add a stone to your cairn, was, among the High-
landers, the valedictory expression of gratitude or esteem.
   There is one Druidical temple, Cairn Irenan, formerly
mentioned, probably the most complete in this country.
   To the south-east of Redcastle, about 400 yards within
flood-mark, there is a cairn of considerable dimensions.  Ma-
ny of the stones, notwithstanding their collision through the
violence of the tide, still bear the marks of art, and indicate
the existence of a considerable building at some very remote
period.  There are several cairns of this description in the
Frith, about the origin of which even tradition is silent.
Were there any vestiges of tumuli on which they could have
been built, or any other circumstances which should indi-
cate the eligibility of the scites on which they are placed,
we might be induced to look on them as temporary asylums
from the predatory incursions of rude and barbarous tribes;
but none such exist.  Urns have been found in one of them,
which, with other circumstances, induced Dr Campbell* to
be of opinion, that the Romans must have been thus far
north.  The cairns he supposes of Danish origin.  An in-
genious countryman+ has gone farther, and supposes that a
considerable part of the area which is dry at ebb tide, but
covered with from 2 to 16 feet water when it flows, being
at least 10 square miles, must have been inhabited.
   Whatever may have been in this, the proximity of this
arm of the sea is of very considerable utility to this and the
neighbouring parishes, as, exclusive of the facility with which
coals, lime, wood, and other necessaries are conveyed, it fur-
nishes a variety of fish, and particularly herrings, in their sea-
son, which have been sometimes sold 100 for 1 d.  Sprats,
