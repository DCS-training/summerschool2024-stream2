			 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.               219

	Boundaries.--The county is bounded on the east by Wigton
Bay, and the rhver Cree, which separate it from the Stewartry
of Kirkcudbright; on the north, by Ayrshire; on the west, by
the Irish Channel; and on the south, by the Irish sea. It is
bounded by water, therefore, on every side, except the north. It
lies between 54&deg; 38 and 55&deg; 4 north latitude, and between 4&deg; 16
and 5&deg; 6 west longitude. It is divided into three districts,--the
Rhynns (peninsula), which lies west of a line drawn between Luce
Bay and Lochryan; the Machers (flat country), lying between the
Wigton and Luce Bays; and the Moors, which includes the re-
mahnder, being more than the third of the whole county. No part
of the shire is above 13 miles from the sea.
	Population.--The following table shews the state of the popu-
lation at different periods:

	The number of square miles in the county being 459, there are
79 inhabitants to each square mile. Taking Scotland altogether
the average is 80 to a square mile. The following table may not
be uninteresting.

	We may state that, with the exception of Irish settlers, who
form a numerous class, the greater number of the inhabitants can
trace back their descent through many generations. They are of
Celtic descent; and it is a curious circumstance that, even so late
as the time of Queen Mary, Gaelic was the vernacular dialect of
the district. Nor was this speech entirely disused in the more re-
mnote parishes of the county, till about the beginning of the seven-
teenth century. It may accordingly be supposed, what is really
the case, that the feudal feeling predominates in Wigtonshire to
a greater extent than in any other county in the south of Scotland;
and that superstitious observances and traditionary legends abound.
These, however, are now confined chiefly to the more remote pa-
rishes, and are fast giving way even there.
	Physical Appearance.--The physical appearance of Wigton-
shire is not striking or varied. Though there are eminences and
hills of considerable height, yet it has been remarked, that there
is no county in Scotland that rises so little above the level of the
sea. There are, properly speaking, no navigable rivers, if we
