     ed, but it is so much exposed to the winter gales, and so high above
     the level of the sea, that it is hardly possible to make it comfort-
     able, or to keep it so for any length of time. The glebe is a
     grass glebe, and may maintain sixteen soums of black-cattle. The
     stipend is one of the small livings, and Government pays L.64, 16s.
     annually.
       Education.-There is but one parochial school in the parish.
     It is in the Island of Eigg. The house was built in 1829, and
     made very comfortable. The salary was, the same year, in-
     creased from L.8 to L.30. The school fees may amount to
     L.10 a year. The present schoolmaster is not noted for atten-
     tion to his scholars, or diligence in the discharge of his duty. He
     seldom has more than from 20 to 30 scholars, and often he has
     none, the parents withholding them from the school, as knowing
     that they make no progress in their education under him. Ex-
     cepting in the Island of Muck, where the Gaelic School Society
     has had a teacher for the last three years, there is no other school
     in any of the islands. Principal Baird, has, however, promised to
     send one, if the requisite accommodations can be obtained from
     the heritor. There are about 600 persons above six years of age
     in this parish who can neither write nor read.
       Poor and Parochial Funds.-The number of poor upon the roll
     in this parish is 10.  They live in their own houses, or with their
     nearest relations.  The only fund from which they derive any be-
     nefit is one of L.30, bequeathed by the late Captain Mackaskill
     of Morinish, in the Island of Mull.  Any addition to the interest
     of this sum is made up by fines.  We have no beggars.
