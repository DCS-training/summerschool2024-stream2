     Statistical Account

Upon Lord Breadalbane's estate, there is little reason of
complaint, as bonnage, arrage and carriage, are mostly
abolished, except some assistance to his Lordship's factor
or steward, in time of peats and hay.  But the tenants
of some small proprietors, complain grievously of being
obliged to serve their landlords, without any abatement
of rent, when most necessary, to manage their own work
of the same kind.  And there is little prospect of relief,
as landlords think it too heavy a burden to engage the
number of servants requisite to carry on their work*.

   Kelp.-In these parishes, about 30 ton of kelp used to
be manufacatured annually.  Lord Breadalbane's tenants
are allowed to use it as manure, or convert it into kelp,
as they choose.  In this they are directed by the price,
whether high or low.

   Lakes, &c.-In these islands, there is plenty of spring
water, but no lakes, except a few that turn some corn-
mills.  Two of those, though small, abound with fine
trout.  There is no river in this parish worthy of no-
tice.  Public roads are daily improving.  Statute labour
is commuted.  There are only 2 or 3 vessels at sea from

*There is another custom which tenants look upon as a grievance;
that is, a yearly tax, or stent, to ferries, smithys, and corn-mills.  Every
tenant, in proportion to the extent of his farm, pays annually so much
corn, meal, beef, and cheese, to the ferrymen contiguous to them.  They
pay, in the same manner, to the smith for plough irons, and shoeing of
horses, though they should not find it their interest to plough a furrow.
The most of farms are likewise thirled to a particular mill, whether con-
tiguous to them or not.  The tenant is obliged to pay multure to the
miller, that is, every 17th peck of the produce of his farm, even though
he should find it convenient to manufacture his grain at another mill, or
sent it to market.
