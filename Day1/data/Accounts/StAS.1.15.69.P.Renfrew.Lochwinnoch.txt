is used as a burying place.  The Pail, or Pele, an old castle,

of considerable strength, to which the lairds of Semple re-

   Minerals, Magnetic Rock, etc.-Coal, lime, and free-
stone abound in different parts of this parish, and a very sin-
gular magnetic rock has been discovered two miles from
Castle-Semple.  The compass was sensibly affected all round
the rock, to the distance of 150 yards.  The effect was most
remarkable on the cast and west side of it, and in every direc-
tion it was greater, as the compass was nearer to the rock it-
self.  In its immediate vicinity, or nearly in a perpendicular
direction above it, the position of the needle was very un-
steady and irregular, and as the compass was gradually brought
nearer the ground, the deviation from the magnetic meridian
was more remarkable, and the vibrations more rapid.  When
the compass was set on the ground, the north pole of the
needle invariably directed itself to one very small space of the
rock, on whatever side of it the needle was placed.
