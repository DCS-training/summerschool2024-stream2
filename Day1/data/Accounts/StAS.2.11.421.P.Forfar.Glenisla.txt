				V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

  Means of Communication.-The nearest post-office is at Mei-
gle. There is, however, a sub-office at Alyth, which is the near-
est market-town, and about eight miles from the church of
Glenisla. Two lines of road are kept in repair by the Statute
Labour Assessment,-the one leading to Alyth, the other
communicating with Kirriemuir and Castletown of Braemar
by the Spittal of Glenshee. The former of these is about eight
and a half miles in length, the latter six. The other roads are,
for the most part, imperfectly formed, and prove very indifferent
means of communication. The bridges are four in number, of
which two are of stone, one of iron, and one of wood. The two
latter are intended chiefly for foot-passengers.

  Ecclesiastical State.-The church is centrically situated for the
population; but, from the great length of the parish, and its moun-
tainous nature, scarcely more than one-half of the inhabitants are
within four miles of it. It was built in 1821, is in a good state of
repair, and affords accommodation for 700 persons. The seats
are allotted to the people according to the valued rent of the pro-
perties on which they reside. The manse was built in 1813, and
ir rtill in good condition. The glebe consists of about eight acres,
Fifteen acres of moor land were lately added to it, by the division
of a neighbouring common, three acres and three-quarters of which
have since been improved. The whole would let for L.16. The
amount of stipend is L.150, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele-
ments.
