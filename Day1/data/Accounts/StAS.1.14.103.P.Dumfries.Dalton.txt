course, through a bed of rocks, has also probably been
opened.  This, however is only conjecture; but it is suf-
ficiently evident, that the level surface just mentioned, is
well calculated for making a canal, for the purpose of an
inland navigation from the upper parts of Annandale to
the Solway Frith; and it is no true, that such a ca-
nal might be executed at a very moderate expense, as it
would requires few, if any locks.  That many advantages
would arise to the country in general, from an improve-
ment of this nature, is obvious.  In particular, the in-
land part of Annandale might, by this tract, be supplied
with coals, and with lime, for manure, &c., of both
which, the carriage by land from the coast is exceeding-
ly expensive and tedious.  Wood, iron, flate, and a va-
riety of other necessary articles, which are imported,
might also be carried at a much easier rate, than they
now are; and the time consumed in land carriage, might
be employed in enclosing, and otherwise improving the
country, a great part whereof having been common,
though lately divided, remains still in an uncultivated
state.  It is therefore to be hoped, that when peace is
re-established, and credit has attained its former stability,
the proposal for such a canal may be attended to, and en-
courages by every man of landed property in the neigh-
bourhood, especially as the late truly patriotic measure,
so long desired, of permitting coals to be imported duty
free, must create a great demand for them; and if the
conveyance into the interior parts of the country was, at
the same time, rendered more easy, the present waste of
time, in the crasting and drying of peat, might in great
measure be avoided and prevented.
