resource against want, but the means of comfortable sub-
sistence to such as are able and willing to work, in parishes
situated like this, in a political view, I should consider it
as unwise to attempt the introduction of manufactures
to any considerable extent:  In a moral view, I should
consider it with regret and with dread.  On this subject,
under all the existing circumstance, the balance is not to
be struck between the gains on the one side and on the

the confinement with impatience, unjustly deprived of the
