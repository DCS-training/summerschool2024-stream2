   Sheep etc.-On the upper end of this, and of the neighbour-
ing parishes bordering on Northumberland, the sheep have been
greatly improved of late, in shape, in weight, and in quality of
wool.  This has been effected, partly, by purchasing tups
from Northumberland, and other counties in England, or by
purchasing from, and exchanging them with each other; and
partly, by adopting a different mode of breeding their tups.
The farmers of the last generation took their tups out of the
whole flock, when they cut their lambs; whereas now, they
select a few of their best ewes, and such as have the finest fleece,
which they keep apart from the rest of the flock, during the
tupping season, with a good fine woolled tup, procured as above;
and out of the lambs breed from these, they choose their tup
lambs-There is a good breed of horses in the parish, and
many prefer them, with a little blood, for long carriages.

   Commerce.-The produce of the lands far exceeds the con-
sumption of the inhabitants.  Part of the redundancy is sold
at Jedburgh, and part is manufactured at the mills of Swin-
side and Oxnam, and carried over the sells to the stockmen
and their herds.  A great quantity of cheese, of butter, and
of veal is sold at Jedburgh; the eggs are carried weekly to
Berwick, and the poultry, both there and to Edinburgh, by
persons who return loaded with salt, groceries, and other com-
modities, for supplying the inhabitants, and merchants in Jed-
burgh.

   Seed-Time and Harvest.-Wheat is sown from the middle
to the close of October; oats, pease, and flax, from the 10th
of March to the middle of April; barley, rye-grass and clover,
from the middle of April to that of May; potatoes are put in-
to the ground during the same period; and turnips are drilled
during the course of June and to the middle of July.  The
