     Statistical Account

upon the banks of the Leven and the lake, is partly a rich loam,
and partly a light gravel.  The rising ground is more wet,
and tilly, and some part of it covered with heath.  The pro-
duce of the ground is barley or bear, oats, pease, potatoes,
and turnips, with a small quantity of wheat and flax; but
the greater part of the land is either under hay, or in pas-
ture.

   Wood.-There are about 250 acres planted with Scotch
firs and larix.  A cutting of the natural wood, at 20 years
of age, is worth about 2350 L. Sterling.  The ash tree, in the
church yard of Bonhill, deserves a particular description, be-
ing no less remarkable for its uncommon size, than for its
extensive spreading, and the regularity of its branches.  The
trunk is 9 feet in length, the girth, immediately above the
surface of the ground, is 25 feet; about 3 feet above the
surface it measures 19 1/2 feet; and, at the narrowest part, 18
feet.  It divides into 3 great branches; the girth of the
largest is 11 feet; of the second, 10; and of the third, 9
feet 2 inches.  The branches hang down to within a few
feet of the ground, and, from the extremity of the branches
on the one side, to that of those on the other, it measures
no less than 94 feet.  There is another large ash tree in the
parish, though it is greatly decayed, only the trunk, and part
of some of the branches remaining.  The trunk is about 11
feet in lenght; the girth, immediately above the surface of
the ground, is 33 feet; at the narrowest part it measures 19
feet 10 inches.  The proprietor has lately fitted up a room
in the inside of it, with benches around, and 3 glass win-
dows.  The diameter of the room is 8 feet 5 inches, and 
from 10 to 11 feet high.
