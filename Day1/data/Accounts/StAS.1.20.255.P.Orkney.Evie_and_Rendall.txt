     of Evie and Rendall.

   Longevity.-There are four people now alive above 80
years of age; one of 86; but none have reached 90, at least 
since the year 1769.

   Religion, Kirks, Manse, Stipend, Glebes, and Schools.-
The people of these parishes are in general decent and well 
disposed:  gross crimes are unknown.  They are free from 
pro aneness on the one hand, and, hitherto, from sanaticism
on the other.-The kirk of Evie was situated near the 
manse, and near the middle of that parish, 17 or 18 miles 
north-west from Kirkwall.  And the kirk of Rendall lies

rest of the heritors, as well as Lord Dundas the patron, (but
who has no property in the parish), acquiesced, the presby-
