	           L.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name.-THE name of this parish is in ancient charters written
Smalbarn and Smalhame; and in modern times Smalholm and
Smailholm. Its etymology, as stated in the former Statistical Ac-
count, is uncertain.
     Extent, Boundaries.-It extends in length about 4 miles, and
in breadth rather more than 3 miles, and containes more than 6
square miles. It is situated in the north-eastern extremity of the
county of Roxburgh; is bounded by the parishes of Mertoun on
the west; Earlston on the north; and Nenthorn on the east; and
on the south by the parishes of Kelso and Makerstown.
     Topographical Appearances, & c.-The figure of the parish is
irregular, and there is a variety of flat and rising grounds. It is
about 500 feet above the level of the sea at Berwick-upon-Tweed.
The air is pure, and the climate is considered peculiarly favourable
to the health of the inhabitants among whom no particular dis-
temper can be said to prevail. Many of them live to a good old
age.
    Limestone has been found in the parish, but it has never been
burned, owing to the great distance from coal. On the south side
of the parish there is an abundant supply of hard whinstone rock,
to which the road trustees have access for making and keeping in
repair the turnpike-roads in the distric; and a considerable quan-
tity of what is called rotten rock is found in various parts of the
parish, which is used for making and repairing country and farm
roads.
			II.-CIVIL HISTORY.

Baillie, Esq. of Jerviswood; Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden; and
his Grace the Duke of Roxburghe.
