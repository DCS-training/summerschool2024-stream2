   Soil and Climate.-The soil of the parish is various.  The
air, especially on the coast, is rather moist, but not un-
healthy.

   Mineral Springs.-There are many mineral springs in
the parish, but they have never been analyzed; and from
the celebrity of the mineral well of Peterhead, at 12 miles
distance, they are little used.

   Lake.-There is only one lake, lying on the boundary
betwixt the parishes of Lonmay and Crimond.  It is now
called the loch of Strathbeg.  It was formerly a small rivu-
let, called indifferently the burn of Strathbeg, and water of
Rattray.  Buchanan calls it Ratra amnis.  By a storm the
mouth of it was shut up, and successive banks of sand have
been thrown up by the sea, and the rivulet has, in the
course of a little more than a century, become a lake of
550 Scotch, or 700 English acres.  For several years past
it has not increased in magnitude; the evaporation from
the surface being equal to the quantity of water emptied
into the lake.  Were a person to measure with tole-
rable accuracy the quantity of water which runs into
this lake, it would possibly afford data for proving, that
the evaporation from the Caspian Sea is sufficient to
counterbalance all the water poured in from the rivers
which empty themselves into it.  An attempt has been
lately made to drain the lake of Strathbeg; but the
person who made the attempt failed in his circumstances,
which has suspended the work.  It is said, however, that
he is soon to resume it.  His reward is a long lease of the
grounds covered by the lake.  The fishes contained in this
lake are, red and white trout, eels, flounders, and large fresh
water muscles, commonly called pearl muscles.  No pearls,
