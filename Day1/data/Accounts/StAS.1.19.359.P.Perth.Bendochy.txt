   St Fink.-There has anciently been a chapel at St Fink,
dedicated to that saint.  That part of the parish which is
eastward of the confluence of Eroch and Isla, would seem,
from its situation, to have belonged to this chapel.  The
houses near to it are called the Chapeltown, and the foun-

sent proprietor dug out some heads, without a body, (each
inclosed between four square stones, fitted to hold the head);
probably the heads of people who had been slain at a dis-
tance in battle.  There was a cairn of stones on his estate,
which he also opened up, and below the stones, among the
loose earth, which was black with burnt ashes, he found
human bones, which had undergone fire; and upon digging
down into the firm ground below, he found two inverted
urns, which had been placed in pits dug for them, each urn
containing human bones; the bones and urns were in per-
fect preservation.  The urns were large enough to hold the
thigh and leg bones, and other bones, entire.  They were
adorned with rude sculpture, but had no inscription.

cleared of the ashes and earth with which they were filled,
were found to be about 6 feet wide within walls, 5 feet deep,
and 40 feet long, or more.  Their were built in the sides, and
