               PARISH OF KIRKURD.

   PRESBYTERY 0F PEEBLES, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

          THE REV. DAVID ANDERSON, MINISTER.


        I.-TOPGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name-Boundaries.-ACCORDING to Chalmers in his Cale-
donia, the word Kirkurd was formed by prefixing the Scoto-saxon
Kirk to Urd, the Celtic name of the place, signifying an eminence
or height. This seems the most probable derivation of the name.
The length of the parish from east to west is 5 1/2 English miles,
and its breadth from north to south is from 3 to 4 miles. It is
bounded by Broughton, Skirling, Dolphington, Linton, Newlands,
and Stobo.
   Topographical Appearances.-The highest hill in the parish is
called Hell's Cleugh, which, according to Armstrong, is 2100 feet
above the level of the sea. On the summit of this hill there is a
small cairn called the Pyked Stane, the boundary of three parishes,
Stobo, Broughton, and Kirkurd. This cairn commands a very ex-
tensive view. Towards the north-west, the view extends as far as
Dumbartonshire, and towards the east as far as the Eildon hills,
near Melrose, and the Cheviot hills in Northumberland.
   Hydrography.-There is a copious sulphureous spring near
Castlecraig. The late celebrated Dr Black, Professor of Che-
mistry, in the University of Edinburgh, from a chemical analysis,
ascertained its water to be stronger than the sulphureous water at
Moffat, but weaker than that at Harrowgate. It has been used
with success in several diseases. The water Tarth flows along the
north of the parish, and divides it from Linton and Newlands.
This is the only stream in the parish.
   The lands in this parish, though in general high, being betwixt
600 and 700 feet above the level of both the east and west sea,
are notwithstanding healthful-the soil being for the most part
gravelly. The soil appears to be well adapted for the growth of
timber of various kinds, and a great deal of wood has been planted,
