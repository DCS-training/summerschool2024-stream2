particular, a very extensive plantation, begun in the year
1752 by the late Earl of Dundonald, and considerably en-
larged by the present Earl, comprehending 800 Scotch acres,
in a very thriving condition.  The N. E. part of the parish,
though mostly arable, is, in general, poor and barren.  To-
wards the middle and S. the soil is either of a rich clay or
dark loam, extremely fertile, and capable of the highest cul-
tivation.  Till of late, very little wheat was raised in the pa-
rish, and hardly any sown grass, except by a few of the gen-
tlemen; but now the tenant, in common with the proprietor,
begins to adopt the most approved rotations and modes of
culture; such as wheat after fallow, with lime or dung; af-
ter this, drilled pease or beans; then barley, with grass feeds.
Again, if the soil is naturally rich, and in good heart, wheat,
after one crop of grass; but, if otherwise, it is allowed to re-
main in pasture from 3 to 4 or 5 years, when it is broken up
for oats, to which a fallow or green crop succeeds.  As a
proof how much the culture of wheat gains ground, one far-
mer, in 1790, had upwards of 30 acres in wheat; but the
present state of the cultivation of the parish will best appear
by the statistical table.

   Manures, Ploughs, and Rent.-The manures used are lime;
dung, and the refuse of tan pits.  The former is brought
from Lord Elgin's limeworks, distant, at a medium, 6 miles.
The plough which is now most generally in use is the light
English plough, upon the improved plan of Mr Clarke of
Newcastle, executed by Mr Small of Blackadder-Mount, with
side and mould board of cast iron, drawn by two horses, and
managed by one man, without a driver.  Best croft land
near the town pays 48 s. per acre, in small parcels of 2, 3,
or 4 acres.  Best land in the parish, when let out in large
farms pays 30 s. per acre, and thence declining to 20 s.
