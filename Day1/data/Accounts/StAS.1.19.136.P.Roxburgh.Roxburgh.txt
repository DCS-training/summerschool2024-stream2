     Statistical Account

in this country, to any place where wilful or accidental
death has happened, the people imagining that such places
are haunted by the ghosts of the deceased; that gloomy
fancy was heightened in this instance by the consideration
of the poor unfortunate's being a bride the day she died.
A little to the westward of this, on the opposite side of the
river, appear several caves cut out of solid rock, in the
middle of a high precipice, whose bottom is washed by the
Teviot, which flows here abroad and deep in a serpentine
form.  Three of these caves have been of large dimensions.
One of them was used as a hiding place for horses in 1745,
when the Pretender to the Crown of Britain went through
this parish with his army, and from that circumstance, as
well as from its having been used for a stable afterwards,
it is called the Horse Cave.  Another, whose mouth is al-
most quite filled up, and inaccessible now, reaches so far
back into the ground, that old people who have been in it
say they never got to the farthest end of it, and suppose this
cave had been a subterraneous passage to Sunlaws mansion-
house in times of danger.  A third is called the Dove Cave,
from its having been used by Lady Chatto as a pigeon-
house.  The sides of it are full of square holes cut out of
the solid rock, and said to have been the pigeon nests;
but some imagine from this circumstance, that it had been
originally a concealed cellar, or hiding place for flores.  It
is probable these caves had all been sheltering holds during
the border incursions, which exposed the miserable inhabi-
tants of this country to perpetual danger and depredation.
At the mouth of one of these caves, in a fine summer even-
ing, when the fun has gone "balflings down the west," the
eye is presented with a view of nature displayed in such
glory and variety, as she seldom assumes.  Many vestiges
of camps and trenches appear in this parish; but the most
remarkable encampment in it is that on the north-west side,
