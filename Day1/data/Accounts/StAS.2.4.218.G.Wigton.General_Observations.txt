                   GENERAL OBSDRVATIONS
                 ON THE COUNTY OF WIGTON.

	Etymology--OF the etymology of the name Wigton, it is diffi-
cult to give an account. The respectable minister of the parish
of Wigton derives the word from wic, a village, and ton, a hill; a de-
rivation descriptive of the local situation of the town, which is sdat-
led on a considerable eminence, overlooking the bay of Wigton.
But the word is susceptible of a very different etymology; name-
ly, wic or waeg, a wave, a billow, a sea, and ton or tun, a dwelling,
or village. This derivation is as appropriate as the other, and bears
a better analogy to the names of many other places in the same
province. The word ton or tun is universal throughout Scotland,
as signifying a village or dwelling; hence, indeed, the English word
town. A farm-steading is to this day, in many districts, called in
the current speech a farm-town. And as to the syllable wic, or,
as it is generally spelled, wick, it is used as descriptive of a place
that is washed by the sea, such as Senwick, Rerwick, Southwick.
Hence we define Wigton as a village washed by the sea; a defini-
tion which is corroborated by the fact, as mentioned by Symson
in his Large Accotnt of Gallovay, and as is known from other sour-
ces, that Wigton, instead of having been at first built on an emi-
nence, as the former etymology would lead us to believe, original-
ly occupied a level site, which was gradually abraded by the sea,
and is now a full quarter of a mile within tide-mark. The county
would necessarily takd its name from the chief town within its
bounds; and Wigton was, at the time (1341) when the county
was formed, if not the only, at least the chief town in the district.
Wigtonshire is sometimes called West Galloway, or the shire of
Galloway, or more briefly, the shire; the Stewartry of Kirkcud-
bright being denominated East Galloway; the two are known by
the common name of Galloway.
