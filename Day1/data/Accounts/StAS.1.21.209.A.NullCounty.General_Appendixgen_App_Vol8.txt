     The Statistical Account.

   There is in this parish an old castle called the Castle of
Duffus, concerning which, both tradition and history say lit-
tle.  It seems to have been built for a place of defence; the
walls in some places are 6 or 7 feet thick, situate on a rising
ground, surrounded with a ditch 30 feet broad, with a draw-
bridge, the only place of access to it.  Within the ditch or
fosse, there is a fine orchard and garden, stocked with the
best kind of fruit trees.  The foundations of a number of
houses are yet to be seen.
   A story prevails among the country people that it was built
by the Danes in the time of King David I.; others, that a
family of the name of Cheyne came from France, got a grant
of the ground from King David, and built the castle in this
defensive state, because they had been guilty of some crime in
France that exposed them to prosecution.  The castle gave ti-
tle to Lord Duffus, who about 60 years ago possessed these
lands with many others in this country,

   Broughead, or Burgus.-There is in the west end of the pa-
rish a place called Broughead, a village containing 400 people
who live chiefly by fishing.
   Here there is a small promontory jutting into the Firth,
rising above low water about 20 yards on the west and north
sides, fenced by perpendicular rocks on the east; the ascent
is very steep, and now covered with grass nourished by the
rubbish of the houses that have fallen to that side.  On the
south, the ascent is more easy, and was defended by three se-
parate fosses, through which the sea was allowed to pass,
arched over with draw bridges.  The area on the top formed
a rectangular figure; in length 150 yards, in breadth 50.  This
area seems to have been surrounded with piles of large oak
trees, drove deep into the earth, forming a kind of rampart,
Pieces of these piles are yet to be found among the rubbish
