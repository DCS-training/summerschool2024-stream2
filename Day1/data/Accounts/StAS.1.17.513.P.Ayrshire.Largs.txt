     of Largs.

is very richly carved, and with great taste, considering the
time in which it was built, namely, in 1636.
   On the roof of the aile are painted the 12 signs of the
zodiac, and several views of the house of Skelmurly; with
the premature death of a lady of the family, who was killed
by the kick of a horse.
   It is likewise adorned with several texts of Scripture, and
various escutcheons of the different members of that ancient
family.
   Below is a vault, built by Sir Robert Montgomery, who)
becoming serious in the after part of his life, repaired hither
at night for devotional exercises; by these means burying
himself as it were alive.
   There are two niches in the walls for coffins; and Sir
Robert himself, with his lady, Margaret Douglas, daughter
to Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig, ancestor to the Duke
of Queensberry, lie in two leaden coffins.
   She died in 1624.  On Sir Robert's is the following in-
scription:

     Ipse mitri praemortives fui: Fato funera,
     Praeripui, Umcum, idque Caesarium
     Exemplar inter tot mortales secutus.

   This plainly alludes to the Emperor Charles V. who had
his funeral obsequies performed before his death.
   Colonel Montgomery, the lineal descendent of Sir Robert,
is patron; the Reverend Mr Stephen Rowan, minister.
   At the Revolution and establishment of the Church of
Scotland, in 1689, Mr John Wilson was settled.  He died
in 1699, aged 44.  He was succeeded, in 1701, by Mr An-
drew Cummin, who died in 1762, aged 88, in the 6th year
of his ministry.  Upon his death followed Mr Gilbert Lang,
who had been settled as his assistant and successor from 1756.
