1639, while presbytery was the established form of church 
government, the parish of Rothesay was within the presby-
tery of Irvine of Cuninghame, and synod of Glasgow and Air.
In the year 1639, it was disjoined from that presbytery and 
synod, and annexed to thr Presbytery of Denoon, and synod
of Argyle, to which it still continues united. In the time of
Episcopacy, it was within the diocese of the Isles; and, by
the act of parliament in 1617, appointing the chapter of the
Bishop of the Isles, the Parson of Rothesay was made Sub-
dean of the Isles.  The parish may be about ten miles long,
and from three to four broad.

   Population.-There is no particular account of the antient
state of the population of the parish; but, from the number
of ruinous and waste houses which were in the town of
Rothesay, it would appear to have been pretty populous. and
of some note at an early period. About the year 1762, some
of these ruins were begun to be rebuilt; and, since that pe-
riod, the town has been gradually increasing so much, that,
not only the former ruinous houses have been all re-built,
but a number of new streets laid out and finished.

   Number of souls in the parish of Rothesay the following
years, distinguishing the number residing in the country, and
the number residing within the territory of the town of
Rothesay, taken from the Examination Roll of each year.
