     NUMBER XLV.

     PARISH OF KIRKDEN.

     (COUNTY OF ANGUS.)

     By the Rev. MR. MILLIGAN.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish has two names, Kirkden, alias Idvie.  The
first only is in common use; and evidently derived
from the situation of the kirk and manse, which are built in a
den.  It derives its other name from the barony of Idvie.-
It is about 5 English miles in length, and the broadest part of
it does not exceed 2.  About the middle, for near a mile, it is
very narrow.-Kirkden lies in the presbytery of Arbroath,
in the synod of Angus and Mearns, and in the county of An-
gus or Forfar.  The soil is various.  About 1200 acres are
dry kindly land, mixed with small stones, called by the far-
mers, a beachy soil.  This part is, in general, soonest fit for
the seed in the spring; and the crop upon it is soonest ripe in 
autumn.  About 900 acres are deep dry land, and the bed is
till.  The remainder is a cold clay bed, and is naturally wet
and spungy, but has been greatly improved by draining.
