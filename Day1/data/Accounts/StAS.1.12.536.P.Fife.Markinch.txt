   Schools.-There is one established schoolmaster in this pa-
rish.  He has a good house and garden, with a salary of 10 L.
a-year.  The school-fees are, 3 s. for teaching latin, 2 s. 6 d.
for arithmetic, 2 s. for writing, and 1 s. 6 d. for english.  And,

diate neighbourhood, are very populous, the emoluments are
considerable.  Including precentor's fees, and other perqui-

school-house, and a house for the schoolmaster; and by the
encouragement she has afforded, and the personal attention she

success.  Her Ladyship has also established, at the same place,
a school for teaching young girls to few; and has provided a
house for the mistress, with an apartment for teaching, and
has given such encouragement, as to induce a woman of cha-
racter and abilities to undertake the management of it.  At
these different schools, upwards of 200 children are constant-
ly taught, almost all of whom belong to the parish.
