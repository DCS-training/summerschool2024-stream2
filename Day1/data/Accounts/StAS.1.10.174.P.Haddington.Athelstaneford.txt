cannot be unworthy of the same wisdom, in the present en-
lightened and prosperous state of this country, to do some-
thing to make their incomes keep pace, in some measure, with
the other orders in society.  If something of this kind is not
done, there is reason to apprehend, that, within a few years,
many parishes in Scotland will not be able to find men suffi-
ciently qualified to superintend the education of youth.  The
consequences of this are as obvious as they are alarming.
Gothic ignorance forebodes nothing friendly either to private
happiness or national improvement.  The other school in
this parish is in the village of Drem.  The late Earl of Hope-
toun, with that generosity and attention to the comfort of his
dependents which strongly marked his Lordship's character,
allowed the schoolmaster 1 boll barley, 1 boll oats, and 1
boll pease, with maintenance for a cow, summer and winter,
by way of salary.  He has likewise a free house and garden.
The scholars are taught reading English, writing, and arith-
metic, and are generally from 30 to 50.  There is likewise a
female teacher in the village of Athelstaneford, for instructing
girls in sewing, working lace, etc.  She, too, is allowed a
free house and a small salary.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church, manse, school-house, and
schoolmaster's house, have all been new built within these
last 12 years, and all of them after the most approved plans;
so that there is no parish in Scotland better accommodated
in these respects. The stipend is 8 bolls wheat, 16 bolls
barley, 32 bolls oats, 750 l. Scotch, (including 50 l. for com-
munion elements), with 25 merks Scotch, as the interest of
500 merks mortified money on the estate of Monkridge, in
the parish of Haddington, by Mrs Hepburn, of pious me-
mory.  Sir David Kinloch of Gilmerton is patron, and is the
only one of 6 heritors that resides in the parish.
