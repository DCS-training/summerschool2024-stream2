due also to the General Assembly to state, that it has displayed
of late years a most praiseworthy zeal in increasing the means of
education in districts heretofore inadequately supplied with them.
But an effective superintendence of the education of a country
implies, not merely a periodical inspection of its schools, or, as cir-
cumstances may require, an occasional increase of their number,
but a regard also to the perfecting of the instruction which it is
their object to communicate.  It is here that our national Church
appears to us to be called on to make still farther exertions.
Physical science has been unremitting in the prosecution of its
discoveries, and year after year have new harvests of physical
truth been presented to the public mind, clothed in the most at-
tractive and popular forms; the periodical and daily press also has
opened up to all classes of the community an extended acquaint-
ance with arts, manufactures, commerce, &c., and involved them,
moreover, in intricate discussions regarding the principles of go-

yet comparatively nothing has been done by the Church to
impregnate, through the medium of education, the new truths
thus brought to bear on society with a religious spirit and ten-

take care, not only that the interests of religion be protected from
aggression, but also that the whole progress of society be render-

moment be disputed.  Would the General Assembly once take
up the subject with a spirit of earnestness and determination com-
mensurate to its infinite importance,-would they unfold to
the people of Scotland, in an affectionate pastoral address, a clear
and comprehensive idea of an education adapted to the present
advanced state of secular knowledge, which, by imbuing every
department of that knowledge with the genuine spirit of a living
Christianity, should thus render it in the highest degree instru-
mental in evolving and perfecting, both for the business of time
and the enjoyments of eternity, the whole powers and capacities
of man's intellectual, moral, and spiritual being;-it may be
safely predicted that, for the accomplishment of so truly great
and glorious a work, there would forthwith be supplied, with un-
hesitating readiness, both adequate pecuniary resources,-then
grateful offering of an enlightened Christian sympathy,-and
the assiduous and persevering efforts of the most richly endued
Christian genius.  In such a state of things, opposition would be
