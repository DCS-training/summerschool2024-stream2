     Statistical Account

tains near 200 inhabitants, and lies upon the Frith of Forth,
on the W. side of the mouth of the Leven, forms a part of
this parish, though totally detached by the intervention of the
parish of Wemyss.  Markinch consists of four straths, or
valleys, running from W. to E., all of them approaching, and
some of them joining one another on the E.  These straths
are separated by gently swelling hills, which rise to no great
height, and which are usually called Laws.  These hills, or
laws, corresponding to the general rise of the country from
S. to N., gradually rise above one another; the more north-
erly always overlooking those that lie towards the S.  The
hill on the northern boundary is in a line with the Lomond
hills, and forms a part of that track of high ground, which,
extending from  W. to E., divides the northern from the
southern part of the county.

   Soil, Climate, and Diseases.-The soil of this parish is va-
rious.-A small part consists of strong clay, and deep loam.
A larger proportion, of light loam, rich and fertile.  There
is also a good deal of dry, gravelly, sharp land, which, in
moist seasons, yields plentiful crops.  But the largest pro-
portion is rather wet, and lies on a cold, tilly, or clayey bot-
tom.  Of this kind some is sufficiently deep, and, in warm
springs and summers, abundantly productive.  But other
parts of it are thin, and, when allowed to lie untilled, apt to
run into heath, or coarse benty grass.  The whole parish al-
most is arable, except a large moss on the N. side, and some
swampy ground, which has been planted with fir, and other
kinds of barren timber.  This parish has little shelter from
the storm in any direction, but suffers most from the easterly
winds, which, in the spring months especially, are exceeding-
ly cold and penetrating.  The climate, however, is tolerably
mild and temperate, and the inhabitants generally healthy.
