     of Linton.

   Lint is seldom sown, and only for family use.  It is worth
10 or 11 shillings per stone when fit for the heckler.  Four
stone from the peck is reckoned a good crop.  Nobody will
risk the sowing it extenlively, except with the view of gam-
bling for the Trustees premium.

   There is no register of burials or marriages.  The register
of baptisms is not very accurate:  A shilling is paid for ac-
giftering, and poor people have an interest in the omission.
