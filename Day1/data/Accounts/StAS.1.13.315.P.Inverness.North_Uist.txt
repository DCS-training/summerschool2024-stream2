     of North Uist.

   There is a glebe, but no manse, the proprietor furnish-
ing the present incumbent with a house on the farm he pos-
sesses.  The King is patron.  The stipend is 1200 merks
Scots, and the allowance for communion-elements 60 merks.
-The number of poor to whom charity is given amounts
to 50.  The only fund for their support arises from the
fines of delinquents, the collections made at the church-
doors on Sundays, and at the time set apart for the cele-
bration of the Lord's Supper.  Lord Macdonald also orders
a few pensions for the benefit of the most needy.  But
the poor are indebted for their principal support to the
people at large, among whom they go about begging, and
who are in general very charitable.-There is only one
school in the parish.  The Committee for managing the
Royal Bounty pay L. 25 a-year of the salary, to which
is joined the parochial salary of 200 merks Scots.  The
number of scholars is in general from 40 to 60, 10 of
whom in general read latin; the rest study geography,
book-keeping, arithmetic, writing, and reading English.
This school sends one yearly to College.  There have been
2 at the University last winter, who got the rudiments of
their education at this school*.
