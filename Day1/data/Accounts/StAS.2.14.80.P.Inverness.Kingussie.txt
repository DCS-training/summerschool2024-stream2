time in question, is in nothing more apparent. or more pleas-
ing, than in the increased facilities of education.  The means of
instruction have been rendered accessible to the poorest, and,
with the exception, perhaps, of a few solitary instances, to the
most remote of our population.  There was but one, the parish
school, at the time of the former Statistical Account.  In some of
the present schools, but more particularly in those conducted on
the Sabbath evenings, several aged people have been taught to
read, with an ease and accuracy credible only by those who have
heard them; while the general diffusion of knowledge, and the
comparative fewness of those who are unable to read, furnish a
most pleasing contrast to the gloomy picture of two score years ago,
when the "greater number of the people were so illiterate, that
they could neither read nor write." *
  In conclusion, we would only remark, that, were the old sys-
tem of smaller and more numerous possessions returned to, which
has been of late years relinquished for that of large extensive
sheep-walks, and were the system we recommend, to be adopted
in connection with the approved mode of agriculture, in regard to
the arable land, the change would tend gread to prevent emigra-
tion, and contribute much to the happiness and the prosperity of
the country at large.
