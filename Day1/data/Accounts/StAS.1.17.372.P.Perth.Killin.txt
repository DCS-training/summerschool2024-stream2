hills, which are not rocky, but covered with grass and heath
in most parts to the tops of them.  The highest mountain
in the parish is Benmore, which is situated by the side of
Lochdochart, in the pass betwixt Glendochart and Strath-
fillan.  Its figure is conical, and, by Stobie's map of the
county of Perth, its elevation above the level of the sea is
3903 feet.  It was in former times a deer forest, but is now
converted into a sheep-walk.
   There is a considerable quantity of wood in the parish,
both natural and planted; and it thrives very well in most
parts of it.  Even in Strathfillan, and in the higher parts of
the parish, where there is now rather a want of wood, it is
very evident it once abounded; the trunks of trees being so
frequent in the ground, that the natives within these few
years made a practice of digging them up, and using them
for light and fuel.  The natural woods consist chiefly of oak,
ash, hazel, alder, and birch; and the plantations of Scotch
and silver fir, plane, beech, and elm.  They are now mostly
inclosed, and taken sufficient care of by their several pro-
prietors.

woods and hills of the parish.  The most numerous wild
quadrupeds are hares of both kinds, the white and common
hare.  Roes are in some of the woods, but they are rare.
Wild cats, martins, weasels, badgers, and otters, are not un-
common.  The fox, which was formerly so destructive to
the sheep of the country, is now mostly extirpated.-Of
the winged kind, tarmagans, dotterels, and plovers, are on
the tops of the mountains; grous and black game in the
hills; and partridges in the corn fields.  The ravenous birds
that prevail most, are eagles, hawks of different kinds, ra-
yens, crows, and magpies.  Ducks of various kinds, herons,
