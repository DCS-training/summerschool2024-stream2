     Of Kirkmichael.

   Not more firmly established in this country, is the belief
in ghosts, than that in fairies.  The legendary records of
fancy, transmitted from age to age, have assigned their man-
sions to that class of genii, in detached hillocks covered with
verdure, situated on the banks of purling brooks, or sur-
rounded by thickets of wood.  These hillocks are called sioth-
dhunan, abbreviated sioth-anan, from sioth, peace, and dun,
a mound.  They derive this name from the practice of the
Druids, who were wont occasionally to retire to green emi-
nences to administer justice, establish peace, and compose
differences between contending parties.  As that venerable
order taught a Saoghl hal, or world beyond the present, their
followers, when they were no more, fondly imagined, that
seats, where they exercised a virtue so beneficial to mankind,
were still inhabited by them in their disembodied state.  In
the autumnal season, when the moon shines from a serene
sky, often is the wayfaring traveller arrested by the musick
of the hills, more melodious than the strains of Orpheus,
charming the shades, and restoring his beloved Eurydice to
the regions of light.

     Cantu commotae Erebi, de sedibus imis,
     Umbrae ibant tenues.

   "Indulge excess neither of joy nor grief toward frail mortals; dwell not on
the remembrance of the dead; for these that now are, must soon depart."
   The other is a stanza descriptive of the unembodied state, and supposed to be
uttered by a ghost, not unlike that of Petroculus in Homer.

     Bha mi (says he) fad an cein an roir,
     B' eatrom 's bu luainach mo cheim;
     'N duradan 'n gath na greine,
     Cha neille connam fein do neart.

   "Far distant last night, was my journey; light and bounding were my steps;
unsubstantial as the atom in the beam of the sun, is the strength of my form."
