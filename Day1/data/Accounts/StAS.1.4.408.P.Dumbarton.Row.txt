schoolmaster amounts to L. 80 Scots; during the winter
he generally has from 30 to 40 scholars, in summer about
half that number;  his emoluments, including session-clerk
dues, scarce amount to L. 18 Sterling a-year.-About
30 years ago, one of the then heritors of the parish, Mr
Glen of Portincaple, mortified a piece of land for the sup-
port of another schoolmaster;  the number of scholars
taught by him is considerably greater, and his emoluments
at least equal to the parochial one.-There are at present
8 poor who receive regular supply, and about the same
number occasionally.  The funds are the weekly collec-
tions at the church-door, amounting to from L. 10 to
L. 12 a-year, together with the interest of about L. 220
of stock, L. 50 of which was lately bequeathed by Robert
Carmichael, Esq; of Broomley, a late proprietor in the
parish of Bonhill.

and mutton, is 6 d. the pound, tron weight;  in harvest, and
beginning of winter considerably cheaper;  butter, from
9 d. to 10 d. the pound; cheese, from 4 s. to 6 s. the stone; a
hen, from 1 s. to 1 s. 3 d.  These articles of provisions have
