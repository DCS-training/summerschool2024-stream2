years, and remains in grass for other two.  The tenant is
bound to sow grass seeds with the third years crop, and is allow-
ed only to cut his hay for one season.  This, however, de-
prived him of the power of trying any useful, experiments, or
of using any other kind of rotation ; which, perhaps, might
be more advantageous to himself, and more improving to the
soil.  Hence the principal productions are oats and bear,
with some barley.  Wheat is reckoned to be a precasious
crop, and very little of it is raised, from a conviction, that
two crops of oats are more profitable.  Green crops, such
as turnips, pease and beans, are sown in small quantities,
through the soil seems excellently adapted for the latter.
There is lime in the parish and in the neighbourhood.
100 bolls, consisting of 5 Winchester bushels each, when
slacked, are commonly laid on each acre, before it is broke
up by the plough. After this manure, the farmer may ex-
pect, when the seasons are favourable, two excellent successive
crops of oats, yielding generally from 6 to 10, which may
be estimated to produce, at an average, 7 returns *.  Little
lint is raised but for domestic use.  Potatoes are only raised
for the same purpose, or feeding of cattle.  The farms at 
present is lease are 25.  Two of these consist of about 200
acres each ; one of 160, two 120, two 100, two between 70
and 80, six from 50 to 60, five from 30 to 40, and the rest
from 25 to 12, besides a few acres rented by some of the
villagers. New leases for 19 years are granted at from
17 s. to L. 1, 5 s. and some land about the village at L. 1,
10 s. per acre.  Many of the tenants being bound to pay
the cess and statute labour, the latter is commuted at L. 1,
5 s. on each L. 100 Scotch of valued rent.

   Cattle, etc.-The are in all about 120 horses in the parish ;
some are hired for farm work during the winter and spring.
