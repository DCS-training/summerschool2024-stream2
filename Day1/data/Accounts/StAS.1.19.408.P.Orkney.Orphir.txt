   Agriculture.-There are employed in tillage 100 Ork-
ney ploughs, and two Highland ones.  The latter were in-
troduced by Patrick Honyman of Graemfay; who also in-
closed his farm with good stone dikes.  It is the common
Scotch plough, with two stilts.  The former is of a very
singular construction, having only one stilt, a small pointed
sock, with a coulter, resembling a kail gully; and instead
of a mould-board, two flicks fastened to the head of the
plough, in a horizontal direction, which, instead of levelling
the sward, serves only to break it into pieces, leaving one
half of the surface unturned down.  This plough, which is
very light, is drawn by three horses a-breast, with the as-
sistance of a driver, who goes before, and pulls them on by
a halter, fastened to the midmost horse; the ploughman
carries in his right hand a small stick, called a pattle, with
which he clears the plough; it also serves him occasionally
as a second stilt, when he wants to take more earth; and
every now and then, when the horses are lazy, he throws
it at them, to quicken their pace.  The furrow made by
this plough is seldom above three inches deep, and thrown
off in slanting direction.  The harrows, which are also
small and light, are of an oblong form, and generally with
wooden teeth, and are drawn side foremost:  There is a
horse and a driver for each harrow.
   The only crops raised here are small black oats, sown in
April; and bear, or big, sown in May.  The harvest ge-
nerally begins about the end of August, and is over about
the middle of October.  A few potatoes are cultivated
upon every farms.  There is plenty of bog-hay; and, of
late, attempts have been made to introduce clover and rye-
grass; but nothing can be done in this way, without suffi-
cient inclosures.
   The manure chiefly made use of is dung from the cattle,
mixed up with ashes and turf, and sometimes a little fea-
