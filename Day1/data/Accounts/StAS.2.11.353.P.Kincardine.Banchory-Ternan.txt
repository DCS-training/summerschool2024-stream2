the ground, fill the drains, and put up the fences, without any addi-
tional charge of rent, and leave the tenant to do the rest. The
leases are for nineteen years, and buildings and fences are now
erected mostly at the landlord's expense, and upheld by the te-
nant. The practice of subletting, once prevalent, is almost un-
known.

	To this ought still to be added the produce of the cattle, or

        Remarks.-Since 1793, the date of the former Satistical Ac-
count, the agricultural improvements in this parish have been very
rapid and considerable. Its rental has increased threefold, and
the extent of its cultivated surface has been more than doubled,
(even in 1806 it was but 2378 Scotch acres,) and the mode of
conducting farming operations, which was then generally of the
most slnvdnly and antiquated description, has come to embrace
almost all the modern improvements. During the last twenty
years especially, the landlords have expended a large capital
in effecting important ameliorations, and done much, by their
example and encouragement, to diffuse a spirit of improve-
ment among their tenantry. But not a little still remains to be
done. Besides the arable land which might yet be redeemed,
from at least 1665 acres of waste pasture and wood of little value,
and besides the planting of some parts of 9339 acres unfit for cul-
tivation, a system of proper drainage is in many places greatly re-
quired. It is believed that, were the large low marshy tract, ex-
tending through the north of the parish, bordering on the loch of
Drum, and comprehending the loch of Ley, the course of the
Canny and some other rivulets, thoroughly and properly, drained
by the co-operation of the proprietors interested, it would not only
redeem a number of acres, capable of profitable cultivation, but
greatly benefit much of the neighbouring soil already cultivated, and
