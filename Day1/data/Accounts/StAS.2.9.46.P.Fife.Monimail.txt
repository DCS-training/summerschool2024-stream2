	   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
	receiving regular aid from the parish funds is 12.  The usual sum
	allowed is 4s. per month.  The collections made at the church
	doors (exclusive of those for religious purposes) amount to L. 55
	per annum; donations, &c. average nearly L. 10 more; and a
	voluntary assessment from the heritors of L. 20, makes the an-
	nual income of the poor about L. 85.  Of this nearly L. 20 are
	required for the support of pauper lunatics.  Many of the poor
	show a very commendable spirit of independence; others exhibit a
	disposition the very reverse.  Generally speaking, they look on
	public aid as degrading.
	   Inns.-There are three inns in the parish.
	   Fuel, &c.-The fuel principally used is coal, brought from the
	parishes of Markinch and Dysart.
	
	               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	   Since the former Statistical Account was written, improvements in
	the system of husbandry have enabled the farmer to raise nearly three
	times the quantity of agricultural produce.  Rents are more than
	doubled; the quantity of cloth manufactured is increased fourfold;
	and the people generally have more comfortable houses, food, and
	clothing; but their toil is harder, and their leisure less.  Know-
	ledge is more generally diffused; but contentment and happiness
	have not been equally extended. External decorum is as much
	regarded as formerly; but family worship is not so generally ob-
	served; and the religious instruction of children and domestics is
	not so carefully attended to as in former times.  Still, however, in
	the words of the former Statistical Account, " the general charac-
	ter of the people has always been, that they are industrious, regu-
	lar, quiet, and respectable.  There are mixtures in the purest so-
	cieties.  But this character is still merited by the present race in
	Monimail."
