   William Honyman of Graemfay, the principal heritor of
this parish, lately planted several thousand trees of different
kinds, but without effect.  The present incumbent has also
planted a good many of different sorts and sizes, but they no
sooner get above the wall, than they are immediately blast-
ed.  A few ash trees were lately cut down in the Bishop's
garden at Kirkwall; which, in the space of 200 years, had
grown to the height of between 30 and 40 feet; and even
these were protected by houses of equal height.  Indeed,
Orkney is not singular in this particular.  We find the same
causes produce the same effects in other situations similar to
theirs, viz. in Caithnes, Buchanness, and in all promonto-
ries, where the tea-air predominates.

   Sheep.-In the hills, and dales of Orphir, there is suffi-
cient pasture for 3000 or 4000 sheep; and yet the whole
number does not exceed 400, owing chiefly to the present
want of police in the country.  For, previous to the 1748,
when the heritable jurisdictions were abolished, there were
bailies in every parish, who decided in small matters with-
in their bounds; and were particularly attentive to the re-
gulations relating to the folding, shearing, and marking of
sheep.  Then no one was permitted to take a sheep upon
any pretence, without the presence of at least two sponsi-
ble witnesses, called Lawrightmen.  But of late, since these
offices have been abolished, every one goes to the hill when
he pleases, and either marks and shears them without any
witness, or disposes of them as he thinks proper; by which
means thieves abound, and the real proprietors are defraud-
ed; and as these poor animals are neither housed nor herded,
many of them perish of cold, and many are worried by
dogs.  Such is our situation with regard to this most use-
