thinking it a troublesome and unprofitable crop.  They have,
for many years past, sown a great quantity of ryegrass and
clover-seed, which turns to good account; the say is com-
monly sold at 5 d. and 6 d. a stone.  They have a ready
market for the hay at Greenock, &c.  There was no-
thing but bog, or meadow hay, for horses about fifty years
ago.  The valuation of the united parishes of Houstoun
and Killailan amounts to L. 4057:  8:  0 Scots.  The real
rent is nearly double, if not more, than it was 40 years ago.
The rent of the barony of Fullwood at that time was about
6 s. and 7 s. an acre. and now there is none of it below
20 s.  The number of the horses in the parish cannot be well
ascertained.  Farmers, who have only about half a ploughgate
of land, more or less, often keep only one horse in summer,
buy another in winter, and hire one to make a three horse
plough in the spring; and, when the ploughing is over, they
sell one of them.  Their horses are generally of a high price,
viz. from 20 to 25 guineas.  They buy them young, feed them
well, and, after a year or two, tell them to advantage.  The
farmers who have a ploughgate of land or more keep horses
in proportion to their labour.  Cows cannot be said to be nu-
merous.  A farmer that has half a ploughgate of land will
have 6, 7, or 8 milk cows, and a few young cattle, in pro-
portion to their farms.  In the hilly and moorish ground, they
bring up more young cattle, on coarse pasture, than in the
low part of the country, where grass is scarce, except when
sown.  There are not many sheep in this parish, except a
few in the upper and moorish farms; they hurt the inclosures
and the milk cow grass.
