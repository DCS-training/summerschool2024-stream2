   Population, &c.-In the year 1755, the numbers were
2098.  In the year 1776, the number of souls in the parish
amounted to 3943; the total amount this year, (1792), in
town and country, is 4676, of which there are, in the coun-
try, 131, and 4545 in town.  But to gain a complete list of
the number of people in the town of Arbroath, we must add
the number of souls in that part of it belonging to the parish
of St. Vigeans, which is 638, and then the number of souls in
the town is exactly 5183.
   In this parish there are 517 females more than males.  An
exact register of births and deaths has not hitherto been
kept: For the year 1791, it stood as follows:

   For some years past the town has increased considerably.
Last year 30 houses were built, many of them of consider-
able value; and this year there is much about the same num-
ber, though not of equal value.  This increase is no doubt
owing to our manufactures; and from the aspect which they
at present wear, there is every reason to look for a rapid in-
crease of population, and consequently of buildings.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Arbroath, which formerly belonged to
the parish of St Vigeans, was erected into a parochial charge
about the year 1560.  Besides the established church there
are meetings both of English and Scotch Episcopalians, Anti-
burgher Seceders, and Independents; and in the suburbs be-
longing to St Vigeans parish there is a meeting-house, the
property of the Methodists.  The church is built in the
south-west corner of the Abbey ground, and the tower serves
for a bell steeple.  It was repaired and enlarged about thirty
