emoluments of the two sessional teachers are entirely derived from
private contributions and school-fees. To each of them are allot-
ted a rent-free house, school-room, and garden, but their means
of subsistence are miserably inadequate, so that it is very difficult
to procure or to retain good teachers.
	Library.--There is a parish library, consisting of upwards of 300
volumes of religious works and tracts, and miscellaneous literature.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of names upon the
poor's roll is, at present, 20: but, including children and relations
entirely dependent upon paupers, they amount to 33, being about
one-seventeenth of the entire population. The allowance gene-
rally given varies from 5s. to 15s. per quarter. There is also
a regular distribution of coals and meal to the most necessitous of
the population, whether upon the poor's roll or not, twice during
winter. It is, for the most part, with great reluctance that paro-
chial aid is applied for. The sotrbes from which the funds are
derived are as follows: Collections at church, fines exacted from
delinquents, and mortcloth dues, about L.24 per annum; dona-
tions from the heritors, about L.58; interest on stock of L.276,
and on bank account-current, L. 11. To this has to be added the
interest of a legacy of L.30 from the late George Cooper, mer-
chant in Slateford. The interest of this sum, aided by contribu-
tions from the resident heritors, and other benevolent individuals,
is appropriated for the purchase of winter-coals and meal, shoes,
and any other little articles of clothing that may be required. Upon
the whole, the poor are well provided for, and, in general, very
contented.
