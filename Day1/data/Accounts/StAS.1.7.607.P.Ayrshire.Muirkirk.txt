There are, for the encouragement of those concerned, the
most favourable appearances in the necessary articles of coal,

Carnwath and Douglas-miln runs through this parish, and,
excepting a few miles in the parish itself, is in tolerable re-

Carlisle is now in great forwardness, and will be compleated
before the end of the present year.  It will run across the

with Dumfries by several miles.  There are three bridges
now a-building, on the line of road from Edinburgh to Ayr.
One on the water of Ayr itself; one on the water of Green-
ock, before its junction with Ayr; and, a third, on the water of
