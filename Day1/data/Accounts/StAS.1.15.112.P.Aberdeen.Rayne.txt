third is bear and two thirds are oats.  Every tenant plants
as many potatoes as serves his own family, and sometimes a
few more, which are sold at 6 d. the peck of 16 lib. weight;
but there is little demand for that article.  We generally
sow our oats about the middle of April, and our bear from
the beginning to the middle of May.  Our potatoes are
planted about the beginning of May.  In an ordinary year,
our bear is ripe by the 20th of August, and our oats by the
first week of September.  We have very few labourers.  A man
servant's wages is from 6 L. to 8 L. a year; and a maid ser-
vant's from 2 L. 10 s. to 3 L. Sterling.

   Fuel and Plantations.-the N. E. side of the pa-
rish there is an extensive peat moss, which affords excellent
fuel, though it consumes a great deal of the farmer's time in
casting, drying, and bringing home his peats, and which
might be applied with more profit to the other purposes of
agriculture.  This moss seems once to have been covered
with oak, alder, and hazle trees; as oak trees of a large
size are still found at a great depth, and so fresh as to be of
some use.  There are at present but a few acres planted
with trees in the parish, and these are the common Scotch
firs There are also a few ash, elm, and plane trees, on
different spots of ground.

   Mineral's, Roads and Wild Quadrupeds.-Such stones as
are in the parish are of the hard iron kind, but they are easi-
ly blown with gun powder, and dressed for building.  Our
roads are kept in tolerable repair.  As there is a great deal
of broom in the out-fields, hares are very common, and there
are also some polecats and foxes.

   Climate-The air is dry and remarkably wholesome, as
the whole country of Garioch is, and many of the people live
