   About twenty years ago, the inhabitants of Greenock were ex-
tremely incomloded by the scarcity of water for domestic and other
purposes ; and the attention of Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, the
lord of the manor, and grandfather of the present Sir Michael,
being directed to that subject, Mr Robert Thom, civil-engineer,
and proprietor of the Rothesay Cotton Works, a man of greatf
fertility of invention, and extraordinary mechanical genius, was re-
quested by Sir Michael, to inspect the grounds and streams in
the vicinity of Greenock, in order to ascertain the resources they
afforded for supplying that town with water. Mr Thom's inge-
nuity having been succesfully exerted in conducting and econo-
mizing a supply of water for his works at Rotbesay, it was sug-
gested to him by Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, that he should, also
report whether a similar supply might not be obtained for manu-
factories in the town of Greenock.  Mr Thom undertook the the sur-
very with these two objects in view. It was executed early in
1824; and a report was drawn up by him, addressed to Sir Mil-
chael Shaw Stewart, which has since been printed, and is to be found
in the appendix to the " Brief Account of the Shaw's Water Scheme."
In -the commencement of the report, Mr Thom states that a plen-
tiful supply of water for thetown and its public works, as they
then existed, was "a matter of comparatively easy accomplish-
general outline of the plan for the creation of the water-Power.
The following brief description will, we trust, make it intelligible
to strangers.
  On the south-west side of the highest rising ground above
Greenock, and between two and three miles from the town, is the
source of the "Shaw's Water," a small rivulet, which, uniting with
other streams, falls info the sea between Ardgowan House and the
town of Inverkip. Mr Thom proposed to form by embankment,
a large reservoir at the source of this rivulet, and thence to con-
duct the water round the hill by an open aqueduct, till it should
reach at as high a level as could be afforded a small reservoir at
Overton,on the face of the rising-ground above-mentioned. From
the last of these reservoirs be proposed that the water should be
let down in two diverging branches, one desending on the west-
training  falls of different dearees of power, to suit the convenience
of manufacturers.  The large reservoir, be proposed, should cover
upwards of 200 Scotch acres, and contain 200,000,000 of cubic
