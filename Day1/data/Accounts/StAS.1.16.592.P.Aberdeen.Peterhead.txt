   Language.-The language spoken in this parish is the
broad Buchan dialect of the English, with many Scotti-
cisms, and stands much in need of reformation, which it is
to be hoped will soon happen, from the frequent resort of
polite people to the town in summer.
   The names of places in the parish seem to be derived
chiefly from the English and Gaelic.  Thus, Alehouse-hill,
(a house which the family of Raven's Craig used to fre-

the name of his first place of residence to a house in the
opposite side of the parish; Cross-fold, from a place of wor-
ship having been in that field before the Reformation.  In-
vernettie, Auchtiegall, Glendevny, and Balmuir, I am in-
formed are Gaelic; and Blackhouse, which was supposed to
be English, I am informed, is likewise Gaelic; Blackhuose
being derived from Blockhouse, which signifies a place of
defence in front of a castle.  The truth is, Blackhouse, in
this parish, on the side of the Ugie, is opposite to tile ruins
of an Old Castle, which belonged to the family of the
Cheynes in St Fergus, and which was their place of resi-
dence, long before the house of Inverugie was built, or
they had any connexion with the family of Marischal, or
Keiths of Ravens Craig.

   Volunteers.-The people in general in the parish are not
fond of a military life; but in the present war, when they
are sensible they have every thing that is valuable at stake,
many have enlisted for the army; and in the town of Pe-
terhead, two companies of volunteers, 50 men each com-
pany have turned out with the greatest readiness for the
