  There are two Dissenting chapels in the parish, both now belonging
to the United Secession Church. The one at Denny Loauhead is
among the oldest and strongest, in point of wealth, in the Seces-
sion Church. When the Royal Commissioners for Religious In-
struction were here on 27th February 1838, the minister of that
church stated that the erection took place in 1738, and that the
first minister of it was ordained in 1751. There was a dispute,
as before noticed, in the parish, after Mr Watson's death in 1733,
about his successor. The cruel operation of patronage was then
beginning to be felt; and some of the people, by proceedings that
took place during the vacancy, were reluctantly constrained to se-
cede. Another dispute arose after Mr Turnbull's death in 1765,
--when, at length, the minister most unacceptable to the pa-
risbioners was intruded upon them, and then another party be-
took themselves to Loanhead. Since that time, the congregation
there has not been augmented by any violent proceedings on the
part of the Assembly. The minister farther stated before the
Commissioners, that it is increasing but slowly; that the com-
municants are on an average 512 ; and that of the adherents to
the congregation, 10 were resident in St Ninian's, 67 in Duni-
pace, and 250 in Falkirk,--in all, 357 beyond the bounds of the
parish. His stipend, as understood to be reported to the Royal
Commissioners, is, besides a manse and garden, L.170, and L.10
for the expense of two sacraments annually, and L.2 for attend-
ance at each synod. He said he had no bond or security for its
payment. His church was stated to have 731 sittings, and the
average number of regular attendants to be 560.
   The other Dissenting chapel is in the town of Denny. It was
originally Burgher, as the other was Antiburgher; and both are
now of the United Secession. It was established in 1797, when Mr
Fergus, the parochial minister, was incapacitated for duty by old
age. This chapel has about 500 sittings, as is supposed. The con-

<FOOTNOTE>5th February 1840. The Court of Teinds was plessed to augment the stipend
to 19 chalders, one-half meal, and the other half barley, and the sum fbr commu-
nion elements to L.15 per annum.
   A new church at Hags was opened for public worship on 19th July 1840.  On
15th September 1840, the Rev. Colin M'Culloch was, without one dissenting voice,
chosen minister, and, on 14th January 1841, he was ordained pastor of the parish,
quoad spiritualia,of Hags. The church has nearly 7OO sittings and 500,Sabbath oc-
cupants.
