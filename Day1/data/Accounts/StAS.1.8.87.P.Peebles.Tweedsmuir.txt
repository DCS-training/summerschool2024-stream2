   Sheep and Wool.-The whole of the parish contains 15
farms, which feed about 15,000 sheep, besides a necessary
number of horses and black cattle.  The graziers in the north
of England, are particularly fond of the Tweedsmuir breed of
sheep; they buy them of all ages, and drive them to their

This operation, no doubt, lessens the value of the wool, but it

part of them is sent to the manufacturing towns in Yorkshire,
some to the north of Scotland; a small part is manufactured
into coarse cloth for family use, and some is spun into yarn,
and sold in that state.  Several attempts have been made to
improve the staple of wool in this parish, by introducing an
English breed of sheep, from those belonging to Mr. Bake-
well; but they were found not to answer, as they were very
