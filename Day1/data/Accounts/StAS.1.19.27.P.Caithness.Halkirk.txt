either for want of employment, or for the sake of getting
better.  But I am persuaded, that numbers leave it wan-
tonly, who, if they were disposed to exercise sobriety and
industry, as they must do abroad, might find a competency
of bread and employment at home.  It is, however, very
much to be regretted, to what cause forever it may be owing,
that a spirit of emigration prevails too much of late years;
for the consequences of it are, year after year, more and
more severely felt by the country at large, but more espe-
cially by the farmers and tenants.  That useful and neces-
sary class of people, had scarcely these two last years, the
complement of servants they would need, because they ei-
ther could not get them for any wages, or if they could,
yet their demand was too high, and perhaps their work so
little, that they were not able to engage them.  I deny
not, but servants ought to have all due encouragement
when they deserve it; neither do I think, that in this coun-
try they have more than they would need: but I affirm,
that in the present state of things, the farmer is not able to
afford it and keep credit.  The demands of the landlord,
which are not lessening, the expence of living, which is a
third more at least than it was 20 years ago, together with
the other expences that attend the working of his farm,
which are also daily growing more, all these are of them-
selves too heavy for all the produce of the farm, and his
other shifts to answer them, though he had no other bur-
den.  All these things considered, I believe in my heart,
that the farmer is the greatest dupe and slave in the coun-
try; and while he is so, the country cannot thrive, espe-
cially since the whole traffick and credit of it is yet found-
ed on no other bottom but the produce of the field.  Let
all concerned be wise and consider this.
   Yet, after all, I think it very practicable to improve
farms, to make the circumstances of the farmer comfortable,
