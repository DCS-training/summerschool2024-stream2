   Roads.-There are two roads which divide the parish near-
ly into four equal parts, one of which runs from east to west,
and the other from south to north.  Both of them have
been long neglected, and are at present in a state of wretched
repair.  In winter, they are often totally impassable for car-
riages of any kind.  There is also a branch of road, presently
forming, leading along the south-west side of this parish to
the new bridge of Isla, and to the turnpike road from thence
to Perth, which will prove a considerable benefit to the
country.

   General Observations.-This parish is but ill provided in
fuel.  They carry their coal from Perth, at the distance
nearly of 12 a miles, and pay for them at the rate of 5 s. for
every 40 stone weight.  Peat-moss, however, is more gene-
rally used, which they also bring from a considerable dis-
tance; and, taking into account the time and labour wasted
in digging, drying, and carrying it home, is still more expen-
sive than coal.  There is indeed a small quantity of moss in
the parish, but the liberty of making it into fuel, is confined
entirely to the tenants of the proprietor.
   Want of inclosures, is another disadvantage this parish la-
bours under.  A small part of the parish only is yet inclosed;
and, from the small size of the farms, and the want of spirit,
and even ability in the tenants, it is not likely that this object
will be soon accomplished.  It is hoped the proprietors will
see their own interest in lending them some assistance.
   To make up, however, for these disadvantages, we have
an easy access to the means of improving the soil.  There is
great store of shell marl in the neighbouring parish of Kin-
