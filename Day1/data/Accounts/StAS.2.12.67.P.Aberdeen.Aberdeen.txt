time fixed on for their sailing is the evening tide of Saturday, by
which means they are necessarily at sea on the Sabbath; and
when any detention occurs from weather or other causes, they
most improperly leave the port on the Sabbath day.  Attempts
have been made to put an end to this abuse, but they have not as
yet been successful.  The amount of steam power in the vessels
in this trade is 860 horses' power, and their tonnage is 2410 tons.
One of these vessels makes weekly voyages to Hull.  There is
an inconvenience attending the use of these large vessels, that,
from their draugbt of water, they are unable to enter or leave the
harbour, except at the top of the tide; and sometimes when the
tide is small, detention takes place from their not having sufficient
water to float them if they are heavily laden, especially as there is
a bank formed where the basin of the harbour joins the channel
of the Dee, which it has not as yet been found practicable com-
pletelv to remove, and on which they sometimes get aground;
so that, on the whole, it seems preferable, at least in the present
state of the harbour, to employ vessels of a smaller draught of
water.
   Besides these, there are two steamers which sail between Dun-
dee and Aberdeen, and one between Aberdeen and Peterhead
during the summer season.  A small tug steamer is employed for
hauling ships into the harbour, and taking them out when required.
   Several steamers have been built and wholly fitted up at Aber-
deen and the making of marine steam-engines is carried on by
two firms to a considerable extent.
   The extent of the sbipping trade of Aberdeen may be, in some
degree, estimated by the following table drawn up for the last five
years by Mr Riddell, the clerk of the Shore Dues' Office, which
exhibits a view of the shipping actually arriving at the port in the
course of each year, terminating on the 1st July:

   The following tables, also drawn up by the care of Mr. Kiddell,
show the principal articles of import and export during the same
period of five years from the 1St July 1833:

<FOOTNOTE>This diminution of tonnage is only apparent, the difference being occassioned
by a late alteration in the mode of measurement.
