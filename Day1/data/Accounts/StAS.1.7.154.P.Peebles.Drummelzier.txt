This, and most of the neighbouring parishes, are greatly de-
creased in number.  A third of the inhabitants live in the
village, the rest in farm and cot-houses.  We have only 6
farmers, 7 weavers, 4 taylors and apprentices, 2 masons, 2

poor in England, as they buy no articles of luxury.-Provi-
sions are double the price they were 40 years ago, which
bears hard upon schoolmasters, and others, whose salaries
have not been augmented.  A lamb costs 5 s. or 6 s; a
