South, may be seen the Frith of Forth, with the adjacent
country, as far as the hill of Tintoc in Clydesdale.  Then
turning to the North, one sees the most part of the shires of
Perth and Fife, as far East as Dundee, and the German O-
cean; with the Lothians on the opposite side of the Forth.
A little to the South-West of the White Wisp, is the place
called the King's Seat; where, according to tradition, the
kings of Scotland, then residing at Dunfermline, sat, and
viewed the hunting of the wild bears, which then haunted a-
mongst there hills; whence several places, particularly in the
farm of Craiginnan, immediately above the Castle, are named,
some of them, the bear's den, and others, the Bear's Know,
to this day.  Thus, the scene around this ancient seat of
Campbell, consisting of rocks, and woods, and glens, and
mountains, contains a pleasing mixture of the beautiful, the
picturesque, and the awfully romantic.

   Literary Shepherd.-There is living at present in this pa-
rish, in a very advanced age, a man who was bred up, and
lived merely as a shepherd, and who received only a common
education; and yet possesses a valuable library of books, con-
taining upwards of 370 volumes; consisting of folios, quar-
tos, octavos, duodecimos, and decimo-quartos.  They are u-
pon many different subjects, as divinity, history, travels, voy-
ages, etc. besides magazines of various kinds, such as the Scots,
the Universal, and the Christian magazines; a complete set
of the Spectator, Guardian, Tatler, Rambler, etc.  They
are all of them his own chusing and purchasing.  They
are neatly bound, and lettered on the back.  His name is
upon a printed ticket, and pasted on the inside of the board
of each volume; with a mark, generally of blue paper, cut on
purpose, and placed in each volume, to prevent folding in the
leaves.  The books are all clean, and in excellent order.  Be-
