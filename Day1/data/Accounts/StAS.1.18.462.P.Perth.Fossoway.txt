     Statistical Account

   There is one circumstance, which deserves the attention
both of proprietors and tenants.  A sufficient distinction is
not always made betwixt the qualifications which fit a tenant
for managing an arable, and those which are adapted to a sheep-
farm.  The same talents do not render him equally capable of
managing both.  Tenants are very careful, not to discover their
want of knowledge in either, when they are anxious to obtain
a farm; and persons often obtain sheep-farms, of which they
have no knowledge, who would have managed a cultivated farm
well; while others obtain a cultivated farm which they cannot
manage, who delighted in, and succeeded in rearing sheep.
Indeed it seldom happens, that one who has been long accustom-
ed to manage sheep, has ever much success in cultivating the
ground; especially, if he is advanced in life.  But besides this,
the master, when letting his lands, is always too ready to pre-
fer the highest offer.  On the other hand, the opulent tenant
generally offers least; while he, who has little to lose, offers
more, obtains the farm, and in a few years, a sequestration
ensues.  It would be more profitable to a proprietor, to re-
ceive regularly L. 90 a-year, from an opulent and respectable
tenant, esteemed, and serviceable in the country, than to
be promised from another L. 100, which he only receives in
partial payments, and for which he is often obliged to use
legal diligence.

   Price of Labour, etc.-The wages of an able day-labourer
throughout the year, is 1 s per day; the wages of a woman
for the harvest, 8 d; for mens between 10 d and 1 s per day;
with breakfast and dinner for both.  Some farmers hire their
reapers during the whole harvest, and pay to men, between
25 s and 30 s; to women, between 21 s and 25 s.  The wages,
however, depend in a great measure on the demand there is
for reapers, and the number that is to be hired.  The average
