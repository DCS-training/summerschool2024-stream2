     Statistical Account

" of oak, we saw, far below us, the river Tay come sweep-
" ing along, at the bottom of a precipice at least 150 feet
" deep, clear as glass, full to the brim, and very rapid in
" its course; it seem'd to issue out of woods thick and tall,
" that rose on either hand, and were overhung by broken

" under the thickest shades, is seated the town of Dunkeld;
" in the midst of it stands a min'd chathedral, the towers and 
" shell of the building still entire; a little beyond it a large
" house of the Duke of Atholl, with its offices and gardens,
" dens, extends a mile beyond the town; and as his
" grounds are intersected by the streets and roads, he has 
" flung arches of communication across them, that add to
" the scenery of the place*.

thedral was performed either by his chaplain, or by some
of the clergy who had fixed benefices in other quarters of
the diocese, it was not necessary at that time to constitute it
formally a parish, and to mark its limits.  In fact, it does
not appear that this was ever done.  It is not entered as a
parish in the cess-books of the county, and none of the old
title-deeds of the proprietors describe the property as lying
within the parish, but within the city, of Dunkeld.  What
is now therefore the parish, includes only what was former-
ly within the bounderies of the city.  These, in the course
