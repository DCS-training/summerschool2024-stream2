   Few of these heritors are resident in the parish, but most of them
have seats in the neighbourhood.
   Family Descent.-Mr Campbell of Blythswood is descended by
a female from the family of Ardkinlas; but his name was original-
ly Douglas, and he is male representative of the family of Dou-
glas of Mains in Dumbartonshire.

<FOOTNOTE>Thus Matthew Earl of Lennox had, in 1497, given ,Northbarr and Rashelee to
his relative Thomas Stewart, the first of the family of Barscube Northbarr was pur-
chased by Donald M'Gilchrist in 1670.  About the middle of last century, it was
purchased by the Lord Semple.  It is now the property of Lord Blantyre, and is
connected with the grounds of Erskine by means of a bridge thrown across the pub-
lic road close to Erskine ferry.
   Rashelee has-been in the possession of the family of the present proprietor, Wil-
liam Maxwell, Esq. of Dargavel, for upwards of three centuries,-his ancestor, Patrick
Maxwell of Newark, having acquired it from the family of Lennox previously to
1516.  Southbarr bad been long possessed by another branch of the Maxwell family
and was purchased by the late Boyd Alexander, Esq. in the year 1785,
   The lands of Park-were granted in 1522 by John Earl of Lennox, to his kinsman,
William Stirling of Glorat.  This beautiful property appears to have passed through
many hands.  It was purchased in 1787 from a family of the name of Campbell by
the father of the present proprietor, William Fulton, Esq. who has recently adver-
tised it for sale.
   Freeland, says Crawford, was in old times the inheritance of the Stewarts of Kil-
croy.  It was called by them Freeland Stewart, which name was changed to Freeland
Brisbane, by a new proprietor who bad the latter surname.  When Crawford wrote
it was the property of William Maxwell, brother to the Laird of Dargavel.  The fa-
ther of the present proprietor, Matthew Killoch, Esq. purchased it from a gentleman
of the name of Ker.
   There are several respectable farmers in this parish of the name of Algie or Al-
goe, a name peculiar, it is believed, to this part of the country.  In former times a
family of this name had considerable estates in Renfrewshire, and were of Italian ori-
gin, the first of them having come from Rome in the suite of one of the Abbots of
Paisley.  The Algies of Inchinnan are spirited farmers, and the name, along with
others in this place, frequently flourishes amongst the prize takers at ploughing-
matches.
