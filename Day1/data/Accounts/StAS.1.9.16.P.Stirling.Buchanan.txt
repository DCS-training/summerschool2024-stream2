and some of them but the points of bare rocks.  The most
valuable islands are divided between the families of Mon-
trose and Luss; 4 of them, belonging to the Duke of Mon-
trose, are in the parish of Buchanan; 3 of these, namely,
Inchailloch, already mentioned, Inchfael, which signifies "the
"Long Island," and Incheruin, "the Round Island," have
a tenant in each of them with arable and pasture ground;
but by far the largest and the best of all the islands, and
which likewise belongs to the family of Montrose, is Inch-
murin; in this island the Duke of Montrose keeps his
deer, and a forester to take care of them.  This island, it
is said, belongs to no parish, but the people in it get
church privileges, when they apply for them, at Buchanan.
In the south end of this island, the ancient family of Le-
nox had a castle, but it is now in ruins.  There are also
three small lakes or lochs within the parish, namely,
Dulochan, Locharclet and Lochamnancairn.  In Du-
lochan there are some pike, in Locharclet there are pike
and large trout, in Lochlomond there are salmon-trout,
eel, perch, slounder, pike, and a fish peculiar to itself, call-
ed pollac.  This fish is of the size of a large herring, and at
times is caught in great quantities on this side of the loch
with draught nets; they are best in the months of July
and August.  Salmon was more plentiful last year on this
side of the loch than for many years past, owing to the
stakes and nets upon the mouth of the Leven to prevent
the fish from coming up, being pulled out; and yet salmon
sold last year dearer than before, owing to the carriers at-
tending more regularly than formerly, and carrying them
off to Glasgow, etc.  Salmon, which used to be sold at
2 d. and 3 d. the pound, sells now at 5 d. and 6 d.
