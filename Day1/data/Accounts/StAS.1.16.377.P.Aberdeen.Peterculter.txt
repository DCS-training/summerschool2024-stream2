fell over it, more than 15 years ago, and both were de-
stroyed.  It was built in 1608, and repaired in 1710.  It
has both these dates.  Near to this bridge are the remains
of a rampart called the guard-dike.  Tradition informs,
that a strong guard of armed men was stationed here, to
prevent all communication between the sound and the in-
fected, while the plague raged in Aberdeen and its envi-
rons, about 130 years ago.
   The other bridge is over the burn of Culter, on the Dee-
side road, a little below the paper-mill.  This is a good
sufficient bridge, and in good repair.  It does not bear any
date, but it had been widened above 40 years since.  For-
merly it did not easily admit carriages, for it had been
built before they were much used in this country.
   Close to the lower side of this bridge, there is a rock on
each side of the burn, projecting a little, and inviting, one
would think, to throw an arch over there.  The summit
of the rock is more than 30 feet above the bed of the ri-
ver.  If a bridge had been constructed on that foundation,
it would have added some grandeur to the aspect of the
place; the public road might have been shortened; and a
steep ascent might have been avoided.  That ascent is, by
much labour, now made easier.
   There are other two arched* stone bridges; each of
which has the site of one pillar in this parish, and of the
other in the parish of Dalmaik.  One of them is over
Garvock-burn, on the road leading to the house of Drum;
the other, which is a very small one, is over a rivulet, on
the road leading to the manse and church of Dalmaik, two
or three paces from the minister's garden.

*There are several bridges in this parish composed of long stones laid
horizontally, and supported at each end by a stone wall.
