Bruce took up his residence, and where there is still an old
building called Bruce's Walls.  Soon after the battle, he
visited the mother of these young men who had done him
such signal service, and she requested as a reward, all the
lands lying between the burns of Penkill and Pilneur, an
extent of country 10 miles long and 5 miles broad, lying
in the parish of Minnigass, and which he readily granted
them, and which continued the property of men of the
name of Murdoch, Mackie, and maclurg, till within the
memory of some men still living.  Their descendants are
still farmers in that neighbourhood, where they say their
ancestors have dwelt near 300 years.
   Some think this to be the battle mentioned by Buchan-
an, as fought by king Robert Bruce near the river Cree,
which he might easily have mistaken for the Dee; but
this is the less probable, as there is the vestige of a battle
fought near Machre moss, on the side of the river Cree,
which is said to have been gained by Robert Bruce over
the English, of which mention will probably be made in
the statistical account of Minnigass.
   I also omitted in my account, to mention the vestiges of
a wall or stone dike running from S. to N. 10 miles through
this parish; yet it is said to begin at the sea, and to run N.
through Girthon, Kells, and Carsphairn, into the shire of
Ayr, upwards of 30 miles.  This wall has no doubt been
a limit between two chiefs, but who these chiefs were, or
when this wall was built, which is now in ruins, tradition
does not say.
   Another fact come to my knowledge, is, that Mr Gor-
don, translator of Tacitus, and author of the Independent
Whig, &c. was a cadet of the family of Kenmore, and
born in this parish of Kells, and not at Shermers in the pa-
rish of Balmaclellan, as mentioned by Mr Thomson in his
statistical account of that parish.
