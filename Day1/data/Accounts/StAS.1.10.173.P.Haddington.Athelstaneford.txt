allowed to repay when able.  In this manner their wants are
supplied, and their feelings not hurt.  Even in the 1782, a
season of uncommon calamity in many parishes, the poor here
were well taken care of.  They got a small addition to their
former allowance, and were comfortable.  The annual expen-
diture, above 60 l. arises from the interest of money, collec-

with the average livings of the schoolmasters in Scotland, is
but small encouragement for a man of merit, who has recei-

that so useful a class of men should be so poorly rewarded
for their laborious services; and it reflects no honour upon
the landed interest of Scotland, that, in the late attempt the
schoolmasters made to get some addition to their livings, they
met with such violent and determined opposition.  If the
wisdom of the legislature, an hundred years ago, thought it
proper and necessary to allow them a small salary, surely it
