			PARISH OF KINNELL.

	PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

		THE REV. GEORGE WALKER, MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--THE word " Kinnell," if, as is most probable, it signi-
fies "Bankhead" in the Gaelic language, is, descriptive of the si-
tuation of tbe church; for the hillock on which the church stands
is about forty feet higher than adjacent haugh, and slopes more
or less abruptly on three, sides, down to the love of the river Lu-
nan, and, its, subsidiary streamlet the Whauk burn.
	Extent, &c.--The surface of the parish; may be equal to about
8 1/3 square miles. The ground vises gradually from the south and
west, and more abruptly from the north, so as to forth the hill of
Bolshan, and thence preceeds eastward, after a few alternate de-
pressions and elevations, through Rossy moor, to the higher hill of
Kinnoul, in the parish of Craig.
