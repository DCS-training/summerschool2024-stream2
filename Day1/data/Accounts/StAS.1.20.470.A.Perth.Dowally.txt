   Besides the domestic animals, forming the live stock of
the parish, most of the wild quadrupeds inhabiting the north
of Scotland are to be found here.

   Red Deer,-(Cervus elaphus), appear in this parish of
late, during the hard frosts and deep snows which in winter
drive them from the high mountains, where they pasture in
summer.  The multiplication of this species of deer, since
the Duke of Atholl has so particularly protected them, ac-
counts for their being seen here more frequently of late
years than formerly.  His Grace has a tract of 100,000
acres reserved chiefly for them, and it is computed that not
less than 4000 feed there constantly.  The size of the deer
has increased with the improvement of their pasture.  Some
have been shot which weighed above 18 stone.  It would
not be difficult for the Duke to furnish a royal hunt, more
splendid than that given by one of his predecessors in for-
mer times, of which Barclay, who was a spectator, has trans-
mitted to us so minute and so splendid a description"*
