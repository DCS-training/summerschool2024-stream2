  Modern Buildings.--The mansion-houses of Borthwickbrae,
Chisholme, Borthwickshiels, and Hoscoat, are excellent modern
buildings: and some of the farm-houses are little inferior.  In-
deed, none of the late improvements is more striking than the ex-
cellent farm-houses that have been erected.  Almost all of them
are new, or have undergone a thorough repair since the former Sta-
tistical Account was written.  The manse underwent a thorough re-
pair four years ago.  The church is old, but in good repair, and
well accommodated to its purposes.  It bears the inscription of
1659.  Roberton was erected into a parish about that date.  Has-
sendean, the old parish, about nine miles lower down the country, was
annexed to Minto and Wilton.  Roberton was erected from parts
of the parishes of Hawick, Selkirk, Wilton, and Hassendean.*
  The remains of two chapels can still be traced,--one of these
upon the farm of Chapelhill, where curates from Hassendean used
to officiate; the other, said to have belonged to the diocese of
Galloway, is at Borthwickbrae, where the chief burial-place of the
parish still is.  The families of the Potts and Grieves are buried
here.

<FOOTNOTE>From the inscription on the bhurch bell, it appears to have belonged to Melrose
tolbooth.  Tradition says, that when the church was removed from Hassendean, the
people in that quarter were highly incensed, and made great opposition to the mea-
sure.  The first of the workment who mounted the ladder to unroof the old church
was struck with a stone, which killed him.  The ladies also showed much real in de-
fending the kirk; and there is an old ditty, which arose out of the transaction, still
sung in the neighbourhood.
                   There are three wives in Hassendean,
                   And three in Briery-yards,
                   They are a' away to Hassendeanburn,
                   And left both wheel and cards, &c.
  Whilst the parishioners of Roberton were moving off with all that was portable of
the old church, the Hassendeam people followed, and a scuffle ensued at a place cal-
led Hornshole, about two miles below Hawick.  Here the enraged Hassendean folk
seized upon the church bell, and cast it into the pool, where it still remains.
