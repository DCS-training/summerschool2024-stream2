   Division and Occupations of the Inhabitants.-There are 280
inhabited houses in the parish, each containing from 1 to 17
souls; and at an average almost 5.  Of 8 heritors only 4 are
resident.  Of these the Earl of Cassillis, who is proprietor
of more than two-thirds of the parish, is the principal.
The bulk of the inhabitants are farmers, who possess at
an average about 130 acres of ground.  The leases are all for
19 years.  In the tacks assignees excluded, and some-
times the power of subsetting.  The number of tenants is
76; of subtenants 26.
   All personal services from the tenant to the proprietor are
entirely abolished, except the leading of coals to the master;
and in each tack the particular quantity the tenant is bound
to lead is specified.
   Servants of every description do not exceed 120.  The
females are rather more numerous than the males.  About
20 of both sexes are employed in domestic services; the rest
in managing the dairy and farm.  The bulk of them, being
unmarried, eat in their masters houses; and, at an average,
the males receive 6 L. and the females 3 L. Sterling, per annum.
About 14 male servants are married, and live with their own
families.  These, at an average, receive 5 L. a-year, and are
allowed, by their masters, a house and yard, 6 1/2 bolls of meal
yearly, a milch cow maintained summer and winter, and the
growing of a few potatoes; all which renders their state more
comfortable, and their continuance in their master's service
more certain-than those of the unmarried servants*.  Cot-
tagers are in number 109, and rent from farmer a house

<FOOTNOTE>

*So small a number of labouring servants is not adequate
to the half of the labour.  The remainder is performed partly
by the farmers themselves and their families, and partly by
cottagers.
