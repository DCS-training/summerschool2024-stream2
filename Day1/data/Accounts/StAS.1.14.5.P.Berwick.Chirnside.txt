ties.  The landscape beheld, is that of a plain, waved
with long ridges, running chiefly in one direction, and
of more than 25 miles extent from the Bay of Berwick
to the Tiviotdale Hills, on the W,; while directly S.,
and at almost the same distance, the samed hills and
chaces of Cheviot form a boundary truly grand.  About
60 or 70 years ago, this prospect, although striking and
noble over the country, was a naked one, and had little
or nothing of the beauty arising from extensive agricul-
ture, enclosed fields or plantations.  If some groves or
strips of trees marked, here and there, the seats of the
gentry or nobles, besides these, and a few enclosures,
joined with them, hardly any thing but waste land, or
the poorest culture, was discoverable.  Nature, indeed,
wore a robe that indicated a deep soil.  The unculti-

spread with thick furze, or tall whins, and, in some drier
places, with broom; which, in the spring and through
the summer, shed the golden gleam of their flowers, and 
their fragrance, all around.
   The eye of a spectator, on Chirnside Hill, now has in
prospect a country, of the extent described, all of it in
remarkable cultivation; the corn fields and pasture lands,
almost every where, enclosed and divided by hedges and
ditches.  Large plantations not only appear around the
gentlemens seats, but reach, in several places to the
extremities of their lands; so that they seem to be con-
joined to each other.  Of such a pleasant seene, we have
here an immediate exhibition.  The plantations of White-
hall, forming a quadrangle, with some contraction on its
E. and W. sides, and running on in lines of half a mile,
advance up the hill from near the banks of Whittad-
der to the croft lands of the village, now turned, in
