worked by a mine of 3540 yards, upwards of 2 miles long,
produces hard and soft coal, generally of good quality, em-
ploys at present 37 people for the various purposes, with
2 grieves, and one oversman.-North Falfield coal, the pro-
perty of the above designed Mr Durham, worked by a
steam engine, erected in 1784, which drains two distinct
coal fields, each consisting of 2 strata, one of a mixed na-
ture, about 5 feet thick, the other fine parret, in great re-
quest for the clear light it affords, and other properties: of
these strata the one is 9 feet thick for 60 yards, then gra-
dually diminishing for about 60 yards, till it comes to
5 feet thick, where splent becomes perceptible, united to
the parret on the pavement, the splent increasing in an uni-
form progressive manner, and the parret diminishing in the
same proportion, till its thickness becomes 4 feet, where
the coal is cut off by a hitch of considerable thickness, and
leaves the parish.  The other stratum is excellent parret, in
some places 9 feet thick, but not uniform; the coal is always
best where it is thickest This colliery employs seldom less
than 40, sometimes more than 50 men, with one as grieve
and accountant, and another as engineer and oversman.-
Consumption of one year, at an average for 7 years past, is

   The pits by which the greater part of the coal is put out,
are 54 or 56 yards deep.  This must have been a colliery
for a considerable time, as an account is to be seen in Largo
house of so many loads of parret coal, driven yearly from
Falfield to Falkland, a distance not less than 10 miles, for
the use of King James VI. his own chamber.  The
