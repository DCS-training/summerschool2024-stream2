ed by every stranger.  Below the Abbey there is a bridge upon
the Esk, rudely built, and overspread with ivy, which has survived
all accounts of its age and founder.  Ranges of trees in the oppo
site direction, close, at a proper distance, into vistas; while the
eye, in wandering over the beauties of the scene, is caught by the
simple spire of the parish church, and by the smoke, which, rising
from the adjacent village, hovers above the lofty trees.
   It has already been said that the lawn which surrounds the Ab-
bey contains from thirty to forty acres.  This, however, is not to
be understood as including the whole park.  Within the extended
wall, there are at least 220 acres, divided into fields, and skirted
either with aged wood or young plantations.
   The only other mansion house in the parish is that of Woodburn,
belonging to Mr Ker.  It is, a modern building, standing on a ris-
ing ground on the cast bank of the Esk.  There are some fine
trees around it, and it commands a most beautiful prospect.
   There are two mills for corn and one for flour.  There is also a
paper-mill.
                       III.-POPULATION.
  There is no account of the population of this parish, known to
me, previous to Dr Webster's report in the year 1755.  It then
amounted to 1439 souls.  In the year 1779, it consisted of 1670
souls; and in 1793, there were 606 males, and 689 females, in all
1295 souls, of whom 1017 were of the Established Church, and
278 of the Secession.
   At the census taken up under the direction of Parliament
         In 1811, the population was,                     1651
            1821,                                         1710
            1831, it was (923 males, and 959 females,)    1882

   Since 1811, it appears from the above statement, that the po-
pulation of this parish has been gradually increasing; and the only
mode of accounting for it, is the extension of the Marquis of Lo-
thian's colliery.  For years past, there have been many more
hands employed in it than at any former period.

   The population in the villages, for there are no towns is,      846

gister of mortality kept.
