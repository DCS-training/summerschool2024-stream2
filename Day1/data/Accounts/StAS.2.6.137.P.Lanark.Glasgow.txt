less, and proceeding from a spirit of envy, not from a regard to the
interest of trade or the King's revenue." To such an extent was
this branch of commerce carried on in Glasgow, that for several
years previously to 1770, the annual import of tobacco into the
Clyde was from 35,000 to 45,000 hogsheads. In 1771, 49,016
hogsheads were imported. As the Glasgow merchants were en-
abled to undersell, and did undersell, those of London, Bristol,
Liverpool, and Whitehaven, jealousies arose which ended in liti-
gation. As the tobacco trade was suspended in 1783, at the break-
ing out of the war with America, the merchants of Glasgow engag-
ed their capital in other pursuits.
	Some attempts having been made to open a connection with the
West Indies, the imports from that quarter into the Clyde in 1775
were as follow: Sugar, 4621 hogsheads and 691 tierces; rum,
1154 puncheons, and 193 hogsheads; cotton, 503 bags. The fol-
lowing excerpt of imports into the Clyde, from the custom-house
books, shows the great increase of this trade. In the year ending
the 5th of January 1815, immediately preceding the battle of Wa-
terloo, there were imported, sugar, 540,198 cwts. 2 quarters, and
25 lbs.; rum, 1,251,092 gallons; cotton-wool, 6,530,177 lbs. The
import duties of these and other articles amounted to L. 5632,058,
2s. 6d., and the produce was imported in 448 ships, carrying 79,219
tons, and employing 4868 men in navigating them. These imports
are, exclusive of grain, hemp, tallow, &c. from the Baltic,through
the Great Canal. The exports during the same period to Ame-
rica, the West Indies, and Europe, amounted to L. 4,016,181,
12s. 21/21d., and 592 ships, 94,350 tonnage, and 6476 men, were
employed in this traffic.
	In 1718, the art of type-making was introduced by James Dun-
can. The types used by him are evidently of his own making,
being rudely cut, and badly proportioned. He deserves credit,
however, for the attempt, and his letters are little-inferior to those
used by the other Scottish printers of that period. In M'Ure's
History of Glasgow, he is styled "printer, to the city."
	In 1740, the art was brought to great perfection by Mr Alexan-
der Wilson afterward Professor of Astronomy in this University,
and by his friend Mr John Baine. They first settled  at St An-
drew, the place of their nativity, but soon after removed to Cam-
lachie a suburb or this city, where they carried on business till where
partnership was dissolved on Mr Boine's going to Dablin, where
he remained but a short times. The professor removed to Glas-
