uniformly kept pace with the progress of manufactures and
population.  Indeed land is of no value, without inhabitants
to cultivate, and consume the fruits of it.

   Rotation.-1st oats; 2d, oats; 3d, potatoes, or barley, with
dung.  If barley, laid down with grass seeds.  After pota-
toes, generally oats, with grass seeds, or 2 crops of hay, pas-
tured 3 or 4 years.  About one-third of the farm in crop,
two-thirds pasture and hay.
   It was formerly usual to interpose a crop of beans between
the two first crops of oats, but the seasons have been so wet
of late years, that they could not get them sown early enough
in spring, or dried m autumn.  From this circumstance, the
practice has been generally abandoned.  Some farmers have
tried wheat; but after their ground was prepared, the exces-
sive autumnal rains have either prevented them from sowing
it, or they were obliged to sow it at a bad time, and it did
not thrive.
   It were much to be wished, that the proprietors of land
would endeavour to introduce a more commodious system of
cropping.  Where the farmers depend chiefly upon one kind
of crop, their labour comes upon them all in a hurry, and
they are obliged to keep more horses and servants, than if
their work were divided by a regular succession of objects.
   I am apt to think, that the great population centered here
by cotton mills, etc. points out the dairy, and fattening for
the butcher, as proper objects of cultivation.  Were farmers
to manage so as to have a proportion of cows to calve before
winter; or, in place of them, allot a few cattle for winter
feeding, they might prepare for them a proportion of cabba-
ges, carrots, turnips, and winter vetches; and, for house feed-
ing in summer, a patch of red clover sown with barley, to be
cut green, and given to the milch cows.  These crops would
