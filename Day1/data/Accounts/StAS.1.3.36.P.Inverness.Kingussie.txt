after expending several hundred pounds, little has been ef-
fected, as the natural declivity of the ground is not sufficient
for the purpose.

   Soil.-In the lower ground, the upper stratum of the soil
is a mixture of sand and slime, left by the overflowings of
the river; a light loam constitutes the second; and clay
the third.  The high land, in general, is a light loam with a

the harvest months, crops are always rendered uncertain.

   Agriculture and Natural History.-Grazing seems to be the
only kind of farming proper for this place; and for this the
hills in general are very suitable, particularly for sheep pas-

redious muster-roll of names, answer likewise another purpose.
They abound with game, and are much frequented by sports-
men.  Grous and tarmagan are in great plenty.  In some
parts black cock and wood-cock are also to be found;
though these are more rare.  In the most remote and un-
frequented places, there are a number of stags and roe-deer.
Wild duck are uncommonly numerous; and in the lake al-

   The natural history of the parish contains nothing to sin-

silver ore were dug up; but the work was soon disconti-
