males in those years in which female twins were born, yet

children were born; and in that year there were 11 female,
and only 10 male births; and in 1794, the number of male
and female births was equal, and there were 2 twins male,
and no females born.

   Marriages.-There is a regular register of the marriages
in this parish for 80 years; from which it appears, 1.  That
the total number of marriages recorded during that period is
544; making the average annual number about 7.  2.  That
there is 1 marriage annually for 98 inhabitants.  3.  That
whether the proportion of baptisms and marriages is taken
for the whole period, or for any 10 consecutive years, in-
differently selected, the marriages are less than a half, but
more than a third, of the baptisms.

   Deaths.-Of these no regular record has been kept.
