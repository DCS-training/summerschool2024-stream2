carefull distributed by the trustees of Mr Burnett, in accordance
with his directions, among the aged and infirm, "with a preference
to such persons who are known to have lived soberly and religious-
ly;" but these, the most necessitous as well as the most deserving
class of the parochial poor, are now merged in the general mass,
and receive a supply simply and barely according to their necessi-
ties, without reference to their previous character; and the amount
of this relief given to them forms an addition to the slim to be as-
sessed on the inhabitants.
   The relief of the parochial is placed under the direc-
tion of a committee consisting of delegates from the general kirk-
session, the magistrates, the Dissenting congregations which con-
tribute to the United Fund, and individual donors, together
with a proportionate number of gentlemen appointed on behalf
of the inhabitants at the time of commencing the self-imposed
assessment.  This committee meets in the beginning of every
month to receive and determine on applications for relief, which it
is to be regretted is regulated much more by the means at their
command, than by the necessities of the applicants, being, on an ave-
rage, certainly not more than at the rate of 4s. a-month.

   Boys' Hospital.-In pursuance of the agreement entered into
in the year 1768, respecting the relief of the parochial poor, the
adult inmates of the work-house or Poor's Hospital, and the girls
maintained there, were pensioned out of the United Fund, and the
hospital was thenceforth devoted to the maintenance and education
of boys only.  The number of these was at first 25, and until the
year 1795, when it, was increased to 40, no addition was made to
this number.  The cause of this may be supposed to have been,
that the United Fund necessarily occupied prominently the atten-
tion of the managers, in consequence of the continual recurrence
of meetings regarding it, and the number and variety of the trans-
actions connected with it; by which means, in the course of time,
