not been abundant for several years.  They are on the coast; but the
people are not acquainted with the deep sea fishing, and their
boats and nets are not fit for the operation.
The Broad-bay flounder is the finest in the world.  The laithe
far surpasses the whiting, in delicacy and sweetness.  Hake is a
strong coarse fish, but when salted, in spring is not disaggreeable
food.  Soles, tusk, and conger-eels are caught; whales, grampus,
and porpoise run ashore, and are often driven ashore by the fish-
ers, in numbers amounting to 150 or more, and varying from 5 to
30 feet in length.
   The haddock is the general favourite, and is to be had, at all
seasons, in the Broad-bay.  There is always a ready sale for it, in
Stornoway, in spring, when the salt-beef becomes tough.  Haddocks
fetch Is. per dozen; at other seasons, they are sold for halfpence
a-piece.  The country people smoke them; and putting salt into
their eyes, the brine runs down the bone and keeps the fish from
corrupting; it gives the fish a peculiar, but no unpleasant taste.
Cured in this way, they are little, inferior to Finnan haddocks.
This plan was resorted to, when the salt was scarce and dear, and
it is still adhered to.  In the harvest season, about the end of Oc-
tober, the natives, in calm weather, repair at night to the shore,
with blankets sowed end to end; and at the mouths of the rivers,
where the ford is shallow, they cross and drag with them one end of
the chain of blankets.  They beat the water to frighten the young
fry, which are very numerous; and hauling the blankets like a net
against the stream, they drive the cuddie fish to the sandy beach.
In one night, by two hauls of six blankets, twenty-four barrels of
cuddies have been caught.  Immense quantities come up the friths
and shallows about the end of harvest.  The fish is sweet and fat.
From their livers, a great quantity of oil is obtained, which is some-
times sold at 1s. 3d. per pint when scarce; at present it fetches no
more than 7d.  When fresh the cuddies are sold at 4d. per peck.
  Very few salmon are caught in this parish.  The gentlemen in
Stornoway give 5d. and 6d. for each cod and ling to the fishers.
