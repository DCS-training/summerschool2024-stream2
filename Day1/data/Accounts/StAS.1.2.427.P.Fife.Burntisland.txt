to be pointed out to Government, and may at least merit their
consideration.  It is this; that it might be made one of the
safest and most convenient watering-places possible, for his Ma-
jesty's ships in this Firth.  At no great expence, a run of the
finest water might introduced, by a pipe, and carried to a-
ny of the quays, thought most proper, where the king's boats
might receive it, without the least trouble or danger.  This may
be thought the more worthy of notice, as, it is well known,
that the present mode of watering the King's ships, either by
going to Leith, or Harly burn, a place on the north shore, a-
bout a mile to the westward of Burntisland, is often attended
with danger, and sometimes with loss.  And, it is to be hoped,
it would be no small inducement to adopt this plan, were it
to be properly stated to Government, that the fame pipe, that
supplied his Majesty's ships, could easily furnish the town of
Burntisland, with soft water, of which it stands much in need.
It would be just, or at least, it would be generous, to accom-
modate a place, at present unable to help itself; a place, espe-
cially, that, upon every occasion, has furnished a very large
proportion of brave men, for the navy; and, where many of
the lame, and the wounded, and many of the widows and the
fatherless, of those who have suffered in the service of their
country, now reside.
   It is suprising, that the advantages of this harbour, should
have so long been overlooked by the public; and no less so,
that, in the present enterprising mercantile age, they have not
been laid hold of, and improven.  It is doubtless equal, if not
preferable to any in Scotland, for dry docks.  Its vicinity to
Edinburgh, the capital of the kingdom, and its ready access,
by sea, to every quarter of the globe, certainly renders it eli-
gible for every sort of mercantile pursuit.
