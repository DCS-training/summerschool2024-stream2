rudeness, disorder, and profligacy.  The degrading opera-
tion of that state of villainage from which they have so re-
cently escaped, the corrupting tendency of that injudicious
management by which they have since been influenced, their
irregular and sometimes exorbitant gains, which at one time
overstocks, and at another starves them, and which common-
ly puts it in their power, by the fruit of three days labour, to
pass the rest of the week in absolute idleness, or in sottish in-

combine to produce or to aggravate this degradation of man-
ners.  In the coalliery of Dudingston, there have been some
agreeable exceptions to this general description, though its
application to the prevalent hue of such scenes of darkness,
is too legitimate and congruous.  Manufactures of every
kind have commonly been thought unfavourable to purity of
manners.  The profits which they afford are greater, and
more irregular than those of husbandry.  In truth, wherever
men are collected together in considerable numbers, cor-
ruption is generated; and as there will probably be some
amongst them found of depraved manners, the contagion is
too apt to spread around.  Where the conductors themselves
are men of steady principle, or where the more respectable
workmen acquire an ascendency, a spirit of serious enquiry,
and strict behaviour is sometimes introduced among the ma-
nufactures, which may tempt the world to call them too
good.  And where the reverse takes place, a spirit of licen-
tiousness and disorder will prevail, which even the indulgent
morality of the world may pronounce to be too bad.  Of
both these descriptions of characters, the manufacturers of this
district afford examples.  Though such moral and secondary
causes may thus tend to communicate a general complexion
