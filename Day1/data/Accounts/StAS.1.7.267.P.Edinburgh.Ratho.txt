many people employed carrying on improvements at Dalma-
hoy and other places.  They soon began to decrease, and at
present do not exceed 825 souls.  So great a diminution,
in a parish so near the capital, in the space of little more
than 30 years, may seem surprising; but the cause has arisen
principally from letting the lands in large farms, and turning
much of them into pasture grounds, whereby some villages
have been entirely depopulated, and others considerably re-
duced in numbers.  If it be a good maxim, that the riches
of a country consist chiefly in the number of its inhabi-

in this respect, to the best interests of the parish.  One cir-
cumstance, indeed, that obstructs the increase of population
in this district, is, the great distance from coals, the parish
being, in this respect, the most unhappily situated of any in

west hills, being between 10 and 12 miles distant from both;
and many bring them from Bonharr, which is 17 miles dis-
tant, on account of the goodness of the roads.  This cir-
cumstance must prove an insurmountable obstacle to the esta-
blishment of manufactures, and consequently to the popula-
tion of this parish; which, however, upon the whole, has
only decreased 105 within these 37 years; the number re-
turned to Dr Webster, in the year 1755, being 930.

versity of St.  Andrew's.  This gentleman, along with many
peculiarities of character, possessed much valuable knowledge,
and, in point of extent and originality of genius, had per-
haps no superior in his time.  He was author of the Epigo-
niad, an epic poem of great merit, and which, as a monu-
