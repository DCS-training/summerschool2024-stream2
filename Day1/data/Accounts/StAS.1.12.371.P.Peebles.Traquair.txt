     Of Traquair.

Traquair have made several attempts to discover lead mines,
and have found quantities of the ore of that metal, though not
adequate to indemnify the expense of working, and have
therefore given up the attempt.  Not long since, a specimen
of the Galena ore was found in one of the streams which falls
into Quair water.

   Climate, Diseases.-The air is dry and healthy, though
there are no well authenticated instances of longevity.  The
lower part of the parish enjoys a mild and temperate air,
though the tops of the hills are covered with snow, and the
attraction of the mountains often deluges the upper part with
rain, when almost none of it is felt in the vallies.  The clouds
are often seen floating in the air, attracted from mountain to
mountain, when there is sunshine below.  The inhabitants
generally enjoy good health, and are subject to no epidemi-
cal diseases.  Rheumatism more generally prevails than any
other disorder, which is generally denominated the pain; the
causes of which, perhaps, are the poor manner of living, the
badness and dampness of the houses, the scarcity and dearth
of fuel, and an attachment ot fishing at night with lights,
which is principally practised early in the spring, and late in
the autumn seasons, after the Tweed is flooded with rain.  In
summer 1789, the small-pox, which, for several years, had
not visited the parish, prevailed very much, and cut off seve-
ral children; but though there was a great prejudice in the
minds of the inhabitants against inoculation, many of them
were prevailed upon to inoculated their children, and all of
them did well, the experience of which has gone far to re-
move their former prejudices.

   Fish, Birds, etc.-The river Tweed, which runs along
the whole N. side of the parish, formerly produced a great
