     General Appendix to

   Management.-Upon No. 4th and 2d, with the help of
plentiful green house feeding from No. 3d, I pasture thro'
summer two working horses and a riding poney, together
with generally five small milk cows, (one of which I intend
to calve about the end of January for winter and spring
milk,) weighing, when moderately fatted, from 20 to 30
stones, Dutch weight.  Such are my conveniences and sour-
ces of profit; the land remaining in tillage being however
unfit to afford winter fodder for the cattle, this deficiency
is in part made up by a small farm.
   This farm, of about ten acres in extent, of middling qua-
lity, rather wet and spungy, I keep constantly in tillage in
four breaks or divisions, and under rotation of four crops.

   I find however, that the farm, with the part of the glebe
in tillage, are insufficient to afford 6 1/2 or 7 months fodder,
(the ordinary duration of our winters from grass to grass) to
my three horses and five cows, with incidentally a young
quay, reared to keep up the stock of cows, and now come
home from hired summer grazing.  To supply which de-
ficiency, I rather chuse, in point of oconomy, to buy in
annually 4 L. worth of fodder, than take the other alternative
of buying in cattle in summer, and selling at Martinmas;
being conscious (as I suppose most of my brethren in office
are) that we are but ill calculated to make a figure in the
horse or cattle market,
