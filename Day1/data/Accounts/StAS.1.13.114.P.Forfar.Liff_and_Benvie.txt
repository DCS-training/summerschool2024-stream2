weaver being for the most part supplied with that article
from Dundee.  Some of the cloth manufactured is sold by
individuals at first hand, at Dundee and Inchture; but the
quantity thus sold does not amount to more than is pur-
chased by the merchant weavers in this district, from neigh-
bouring parishes, who, therefore, may be said to deal to the
extent of the whole cloth manufactured here.  The mer-
chant weavers are 5 in number, and are themselves included
in the lift of operative manufacturers.  All of them, one
excepted, who buys to the greatest extent, dispose of their
whole stock either in Dundee of Perth, or Cupar of An-
gus, preferring a smaller gain at home, to the risk of a
greater in the hands of correspondents at London.  Almost
half of their cloth is bleached before it is sold, and of late
they have adopted the method, of what is termed here dry-
bleaching, which is nothing more than after boiling the
cloth in water, mixed with a due quantity of pot-ashes, to
wash the lees from it, and leave it to whiten on the ground
by the action fo the sun and weather, without, as former-
ly, sprinkling water upon it.  The cloth by this means is
equally  well bleached, and much labour as well as expense
is saved.  The following is pretty accurate statement of
the webs manufactured in one year, and the prices at which
they are commonly sold by the manufacturers.
