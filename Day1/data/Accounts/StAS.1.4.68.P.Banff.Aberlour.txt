and burials for 20 years, it appears, that the baptisms are,
at an average, 25, deaths 13, and marriages 8.  Though
there are scarce any remarkable for longevity, yet the
people are generally healthy, and, a few expected, who are
carried off by small pox and consumptions, arrive at
the age of 70, 80 and not a few at 84.  The whole
are of the Established Church, except about 10 or 11,
who are Roman Catholics.  The inhabitants, except a ve-
ry few servants and cottagers who come from Strathspey
and Badenoch, are natives, descended from ancestors who
have lived in the parish for many generations; and as there
are very few who come from other places, so there are
as few who leave the parish:  For since the year 1782,
when there were whole families emigrating from the neigh-
bouring parishes to North America, none, except a few
aspiring young men, who have had a more liberal education
than their neighbours, have left this parish, and gone, some
to London, some to the West India Islands.  There is but
one residing heritor.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, etc.-The church seems to be

year 1772 was only L. 50;  but at that period the Earl of
Fife, as patron, without any application from the incum-
bent or any in his name with generosity worthy of his
Lordship, proposed an augmentation of the stipend, and
desired the incumbent to name what augmentation he
thought the minister of Aberlour ought to have; who,
with the advice of the presbytery, proposed L. 8: 6: 8
Sterling, of money, with 18 bolls of oat-meal, at 8 stone
the boll, which his Lordship agreed to, and obtained a de-
creet, without any expence to the incumbent:  So that, at
present, the stipend is L. 58: 6: 8 of money, and 18 bolls
