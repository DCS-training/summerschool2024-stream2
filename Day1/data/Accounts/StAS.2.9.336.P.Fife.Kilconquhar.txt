The average amount of collections for the poor at the church
door,. for the last seven years, has annually been L. 66, Is. 4d.
The interest of money belonging to the kirk-session L. 38; pro.
clamation dues, L. 2, 4s. 3d ; morteloth do. L. 3, .1 Is. 9d., making
in all L. 109, 17s. 4d. The remaining sum has been raised by
a voluntary contribution from the-heritors according to their va-
lued rents.
Prisons- There is a jail in Earlsferry in a very wretched state,
but fortunately we rarely have occasion to use it.-
                    OBSERVATIONS.
Local advantages.-This parish has many local advantages.
Being near the sea, we are abundantly supplied with all the varie-
ties of fish caught on the coast. We have a plentiful supply of
coals, which are sold at the mouth of the pit, at 5s. per single
horse cart-load. We have a much greater quantity of all kinds
of agricultural produce-than can be used in the parish.
   Improvements.-Since the date of the former Statistical Account,
great improvements have been made in agriculture, particularly in
draining and turnip husbandry. Buildings of every description are
greatly improved, especially farm-houses, which, from being gene-
rally small and covered with thatch or tile, are now large and com-
modious, and finished in a style that would have been thought
extravagant forty years ago. Thrashing-mills are now universal,
wherever the farms are of any considerable extent. There are
23 thrashing mills in the parish, which are still driven by horses.
  A new era is commencing for the lessening of labour, by the in-
troduction of steam engines. There are as yet only six steam en-
nes in the parish, and only one of these is applied to a thrashing
mill namely. at the farm of Balniel Den, the property of Colonel
Lindsay. It may safely be predicted, that, before another half
century elapses, it will be as uncommon to see a thrashing mill
driven by horses, as it now is to see corn thrashed with flails.
  The number of persons- qualified to vote for a Member of Par-
liament is 70.
