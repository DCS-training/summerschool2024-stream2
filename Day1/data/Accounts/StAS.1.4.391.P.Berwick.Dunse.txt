   Miscellaneous Observations.-In 1782-3, when victual
was at a very high price, the heritors, and other inhabitants
in good circumstances, contributed very largely for the sup-
port of the poor and indigent, and sold at least 20 bolls
weekly, from the 3 d of December 1782, to the middle of 
August 1783, at one-third below the market-price.  The
inhabitants are humane and generous to all real objects.
They are also industrious and economical, and contented
with their situation and circumstances.-There is a public
library in Dunse, which was establish in 1768, consisting
of about 60 shares, at L. 2 a share, and 6 s. a-year; the 
shares are transferable, like any other property.  From the 
original L. 2 for each share, and the 6 s. also advanced for 
the year's reading, we were enabled to buy at once near
L. 150 worth of books, and from L. 12 to L. 15 has been
expended annually upon books ever since that period.-
There are 3 great fairs in Dunse.  At these is a very great
shew of fine cattle and horses.  At least L. 20,000 Sterling
is received for cattle at these fairs, which are chiefly pur-
chased by English dealers.  There is also a good deal of
sheep.-The roads were originally made and kept up by
the statute-labour, except the two great roads from Edin-
burgh to London, the one by Greenlaw and Coldstream,
the other by the Press and Berwick, which were made by
sums borrowed by the gentlemen of the county upon the
turnpikes.  The statute-labour is now commuted at 7 s. 6 d.
each horse, and 3 s. on householders.  The question re-
