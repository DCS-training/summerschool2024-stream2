   parish is in a great measure extinct. This change is by some con-
   sidered to have been carried too far, as having a tendency to pro-
   duce a race of horses of a size disproportioned to the work. The
   price of a good horse at present will vary according to his quality
   from L. 15 to L.35.
     Sheep.*--Owing to the extensive improvement of waste and pas-
   ture land, comparatively few sheep are now reared in the parish.
   At present no attention seems to be paid to the breed, one flock fre-
   quently consisting of half a dozen different kinds. The flock at
   Sandlaw of the pure Leicester breed, famed for their size and the
   fineness of their wool, is perhaps the only exception. Besides the
   small number (679) at present reared in the parish, it may be not-
   ed that, for the last five or six years, large flocks from the High-
   lands come here for winter pasture, on the approach of snow on
   their native hills. The number thus pasturing at present is 3700
   of the Highland, Strathdown, and Lanark breeds. The total
   amount received for the winter's pasture does not exceed L.80.
     Live-Stock.--From an accurate survey made in December last,
   we are enabled to state the average number of the different kinds
   of live-stock as follows: 241 work horses; 101 other horses of
   every age and description; 22 work-oxen; 558 cows;--541 one
   year olds;--401 two, year olds;--27 I three year olds ;--76 four
   year olds; 679 sheep; 191 swine; and 1 goat.
     The following table exhibits nearly the annual amount received
   from sales of live-stock now generally shipped at Banff for the
   London market:

     It ought perhaps to be noted, that, within the last forty years,
   great improvement has taken place in all kinds of handicraft, our
   masons, wrights, smitbs, shoemakers, &c. being generally very su-
   perior workmen.
     Leases, &c.--These extend here to nineteen years. Although
   farm-buildings are more substantial and comfortable than they
   were forty years ago, there is still ample room for improvement.

<FOOTNOTE>Mr Morrison of Montblairy has of late years introduced a very large floek of
   sheep of the most approved Enjush breeds.
