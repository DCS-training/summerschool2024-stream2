is almost the only sort of fuel which is used in the parish, except
in the remote parts, where peat is easily procured, and the carriage
of coal is long and difficult.
			MISCELLANIEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Since the period when the last Statistical Account was written,
very considerable and important changes have taken place. Stock
of all kinds, but especially sheep and cattle, have been improved.
A much greater extent of land is in cultivation, and that too cul-
tivated in a more judicious manner. Such a quantity of grain
and other kinds of produce is now raised in this district of coun-
try, as to be sufficient for the supply of the inhabitants. The great
distance from lime, it must however be acknowledged, is a great
bar to the farther breaking up of waste land, or the successful cul-
tivation of what has already been broken up. Manufactures have
also been considerably increased during the last forty years; but
are far from being yet carried to the extent to which they might
be carried with advantage. The banks of the streams afford many
eligible situations for impelling machinery by water. Coal and
stone for building are cheap and abundant. It must be allowed,
however, that the possession of the land by few proprietors is not fa-
vourable to the calling forth of a spirit of enterprise, however great
may be the natural advantages. The distance from water carriage,
and the thinly peopled state of the country, are also obstacles to
the, extensive establishment of manufactures in this parish, which
do not exist in many other districts of the country.
