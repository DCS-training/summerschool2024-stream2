ford to lay out much money upon their farms; but even if
any of them should have the spirit, to lay out part of their
time and labour, in improving a piece of land, which other-
wise might be of little value, from the prospect of advan-
tage to themselves, though not immediate, upon looking for-
ward, he is discouraged, as he finds his lease, before he had
time to put his farm in order, drawing near an end; and thus
the fruit of his labour, from which he might have any return
himself, is to be conveyed to another, for a trifle of more rent.
For 2 or 3 years, therefore, before the end of the lease, the tenant
does nothing but what brings an immediate return.  The lease
being so short, makes the return of these periods frequent,
which must hurt the farms considerably, and consequently
the proprietors themselves, ultimately.  Another circum-
stance, which is considered as unfavourable to improvement,
is, the crouding many tenants upon one farm; 4, 6, and 8.
It is well known, that no work, under the management of
many, where every one claims an equal share in the direction
can go smoothly on.  Different opinions may occasion some
obstruction, especially if any thing, out of the common tract,
is to be done.  By this observation, it is not meant to put
the farms into fewer hands; but to divide them, and for the
most part to have but one on each possession; and when they
happen to be larger, two.  This would bring on a considerable
outlay; yet might form a source of more sure income to the pro-
prietor, and greater comfort to the tenant.  This division has
been found very useful in other parts of Argyll-shire.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-This not being a commercial
country, money is flow in its circulation; so that there can
be no inducement for a Jew to reside in it.  All the inhabit-
ants, except 2 shepherds, are natives of this and the neigh-
bouring parishes.  Such disputes as require the investigation
