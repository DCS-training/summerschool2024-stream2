disagreeable tone, and use many words improperly.  The
names of places are mostly of English derivation; one or two
perhaps of Saxon.  I am in doubt whether Philogar and

corn of all kinds for bread, and even oats for the feeding of
horses, are brought from the low part of the country, which
produces much more grain than is necessary for its own con-
sumption.  There are indeed, towards the under part of the
