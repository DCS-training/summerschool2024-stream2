upon the banks of a lake of 500 acres extent, and in form of
a crescent, was built in 1763, for what was at that time un-
derstood to be the legal allowance, 1000 l. Scotch, and con-
sequently upon a small plan, and poorly executed.  In 1777
it was repaired, and some additions made to it.  The glebe
consists of about 6 acres.  The annexed parish of SOUTH-
WICK lies to the eastward, and the minister possesses also a
glebe there of about 8 acres.  Although the walls of the old
church of southwick, which stands in a very romantic small
strath about 4 miles E. from the parish church, still remain
in many places at their full heighth, yet there is not the
smallest tradition of any incumbent there, or of any circum-
stance relating to it as a separate charge.  It appears to have
been annexed to Colvend ever since the reformation.  In Fe-
bruary 1650, Mr David Hope, then incumbent, obtained de-
creet agaist the heritors of both parishes, modifying the sti-
pend at 3 chalders of victual, two thirds meal and one-third
bear, and 400 l Scotch of money, with 50 merks for commu-
nion elements.  By a new decreet in 1789, the stipend was
modified at 800 l. Scotch, with 40 l. Scotch for communion
elements, and the victual continued.  However long these
parishes have been united, their antient boundaries are still
distinctly known, Colvend is to Southwick*, in point of
rental, extent of territory, and population, nearly as three to
two.
