and ancestor of the present John Hamilton, Esq; of Bar-
dowie.  From that time, the proprietor of the barony ap-
pears to have taken the title of Bardowie; and the title of
Bathernock (now written Baldernock,) dropped by the fami-

the parish, when it came to be erected.  But when that
erection took place, or when the name Bathernock came to

South to North there is a gradual ascent, pleasantly diversi-
fied by round swelling hills.  The flat ground, before men-
tioned, is a rich loam; the rising grounds towards the East,
are a clayey soil over till; and those towards the West, a
a light sharp soil over whin rock.  On the North side there
some moorish ground, but the greater part of the parish is
