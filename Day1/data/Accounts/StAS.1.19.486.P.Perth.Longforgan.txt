their own, they sent from London 400 quarters of the best
mealing English oats, which they directed to be ground into
meal, to be sold at the Dundee market price to all of their
tenants who wanted, and who could afford to pay; and to
those, whose daily earning were not sufficient to maintain
themselves and family, they ordered the meal to be given
out weekly at a reduced price, i. e. at 1 s. per peck, and to
continue till next harvest; and to the poor for nothing.

   Few Poor.-It may seem extraordinary, that in a parish
consisting of 1500 souls and upwards, and in which there is
a village of nearly half the number, principally labourers
and manufacturers, there are so few who receive chari-
ty; and still more extraordinary that there is but one
travelling beggar in the whole parish; even she receives
parochial supplies, but she has got such a habit of begging,
nothing can restrain her.  Of that class, nay pass through
the parish, but they come from the neighbouring towns, and
many from the Highlands.  This may be accounted for as
follows:

   Reasons why.-Every native of this parish, who is in real
want, upon proper application, gets a supply as far as the
funds will admit, and according to his or her necessities.
   If they be totally unable to do any thing for their own
maintenance, of if they have a family to provide for, which
they are unable to do, they get more; if they be single, or if
they have friends or relations who can help them, they get less.
For it is the leading feature or this charity, that the poor are
to be supplied with the necessaries of life, and not with the
superfluities, and in such a manner as to be a spur to the in-
dustry of all, especially of the rising generation, and not to
encourage sloth, and support idleness and extravagance.
