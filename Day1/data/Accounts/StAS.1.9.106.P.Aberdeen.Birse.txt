   Surface, Soil and Climate.-The surface is uneven, hilly,
and even rocky and mountainous.  It is beautifully diver-
sified with hill and dale, wood and water.  Many spots in
it are most delightful; they afford the pleasures of a rural
life in abundance, and such as can relish these pleasures
must be highly delighted with the variegated appearance
of the country.  The soil is light and sharp, sandy in some
places, in others a dark brown loam.  It is mostly on a
hard and gravellish bottom.  In a few places the bottom is
inclined to clay; when justice is done to the soil, the pro-
duce will sufficiently reward the husbandman for his labour
and expense.  The air is pure, and the climate temperate
and healthy.  On the banks of the Dee snow lies not so
long as in some other places.  There are no diseases pecu-
liar to the parish.  Many of the inhabitants arrive at a good
old age, as the population-table will evince.  Some families
seem to have their blood tainted with the scrofula; some
complain of rheumatism (more frequently indeed than their
forefathers), and a few young people die of consumptions.
In general, however, they are a blooming healthy race.
Inoculation is practised a little with success; the sensible
part of the people do not seem averse from it.

   Hills and Mosses, Birds and Game, etc.-As there are 3
straths or districts of which the parish is made up, so there
are 3 large ridges of hills taking their rise towards the ri-
ver Dee, and running in a S. W. direction till they termi-
nate in the heart of the Grampians, of which indeed they are
a part.  Peter-hill, the White-hill, and Mulbrax, are in the
south ridge.-The Ords, the Shooting greens, (over which
the great road leading from the river Dee to the Cairn
o'Mount passes); Tomcairn, Corse-Dardar, (over which
the public road from E. to W. passes); hills of Midstrath
and Arntilly, Lamachip, and Brackenstaik, are in the mid-
