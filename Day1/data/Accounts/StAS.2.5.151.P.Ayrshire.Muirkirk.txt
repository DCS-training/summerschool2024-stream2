	Mines.--There are numerous mines of coal, ironstone, and lime,
all wrought upon the most approved plants. The principal seam
of coal being thick, and the rise moderate, rail-roads are laid, and
horses employed to drag the coal and ironstone from the rooms
and other workings to the bottom of the shaft. As in other parts
of Scotland, a part only of the stratum is excavated in the first
working of the pit, the other part being left as pillars to support
the roof. The miners are much troubled with choke damp or
carbonic acid gar; but never with inflammable damp or carburet-
ted hydrogen gas.
	Natural woods.--It appears from a charter granted to the monks
of Melrose by the Grand Stewart of Scotland, that this and the
neighbouring parish of Sorn were a forest in the end of the twelfth
century. That it was, at one time, covered with trees is abundant-
ly evident, from the names of many of the farms, from the trees
found in mosses, and from small clumps and detached trees of
birch and mountain-ash still to be seen on braes, and by the sides
of narrow ravines. To whatever cause the destruction of these
trees may be attributed, it is much to be regretted. In a hilly
country such as this, the want of shelter is severely felt; and the
prostrate trunks and branches, by obstructing water and assisting
in the formation of moss earth, must have proved highly injurious
to the climate. The Honourable Keith Stewart, who became
proprietor by purchase about forty years ago, of the greater por-
tion of the land in this parish, judiciously planted numerous belts
near the water of Ayr. They are composed mostly of larch,
spruce, and fir; but whether from carelessness, bad management,
or the trees not suiting the soil, some of them have made but lit-
