   Rentals.-It is not easy to ascertaln the real rent of those
parishes, as some one or other of the proprietors has a new
set of the whole or some part of his lands every year.  It is
still more difficult to estimate the value of the casualities they
pay ils kain fowls, etc. and the personal services they are o-
bliged to perform.  It may, however, be computed at about
1600 L. Sterling of real rent yearly.  The valued rent is
247 L. 7 s. 8 d. Sterling.

   Ecclesiastical State, Poor, etc.-The Duke of Argyle is pa-

The wages of servants have advanced to nearly double what
they were 20 years ago.  The usual day wages to a man ser-

masons, according to their skill and experience, get from 1 s. 6 d.
to 2 s. per day without maintenance.  Taylors and Shoemakers
8 d. besides their victuals.  Household men servants from 5 L.
to 6 L. a-year.  Maid servant from 1 L. 15 s. to 2 L. 10 s. and
shoes.
