course of the winter and spring. No fixed price was stipulated but
such as was going in town after the ensuing Candlemas,-or, in other
words, such a price as the purchasers agreed among themselves to
give the tenants in general.  The latter, therefore, had no alterna-
tive but to accept of such a price as was offered, or otherwise lose
their customer.

   This was the practice fifteen or sixteen years ago, but now, as
distilleries have multiplied in the burgh of Campbelton, where the
price of grain varies according to weight and quality, the farmer
obtains a fair remunerating price, every Thursday being a market
day, and the practice of dealing with customers is abolished.
    All the lands in the parish are possessed by ten heritors, and let
in lease to 111 tenants,--only six of the latter are graziers, who
solely depend upon the sale of black cattle and sheep for pay-
ment of rents.
    The valued rent of the parish is L.453, 13s. Id.  The present
rent, in Sterling money, L.9483.  When the last Statistical Ac-
count was written, it appears, that the rent-roll did not exceed, in
toto, L.3705 Sterling.  The subsequent rent-roll, taken down
from the verbal report of the tenants, cannot be far wrong.

   Owing to the depreciation of grain, and the low price of cattle,
there is reason to believe that the rents have considerably dimi-
inshed.  Only two of the preceding heritors have family seats in
the parish, viz.  Macdonald of Largie, and M'Alister of Glenbarr,
-the former occasional visitors, and the latter a constant residenter.
   After perusing the preceding rent-roll, and comparing it with
the rents of the parish forty years ago, it may be reasonably in-
ferred, that the mode of cultivating land is not only progressively
improving, but that a considerable extent of soil, which was for.
merly waste and useless, has been subjected to the operations of
the plough.  Much still remains to be done in the way of enclo-
sures and subdivisions, and adopting a more Judicious rotation of
white and green crops.
