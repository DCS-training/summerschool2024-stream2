   When this place was much frequented by shipping, ship-buiId-
ing, for which the beach and the patent slip afforded great conve-
nience, was carried on to a considerable extent. The names of
Hart and of Boag were well known, even in Greenock. Very few
vessels are built here now; but the patent slip has been frequently
employed of late.
   As shipping and commerce now find more direct and easy ac-
cess to various parts of the country than formerly, there seems to
be but little prospect of any great return of trade to this place,
except by the establishment of manufactures; and few places pos-
sess greater advantages for this purpose. A harbour, the safest
and most accessible in the Frith,-a ready communication with
all parts of the country by land and water,-an abundant supply
of coal,-and a large population, having at present but irregular,
or inadequate employment,-present unusual advantages for the
investment of capital in manufactures.
