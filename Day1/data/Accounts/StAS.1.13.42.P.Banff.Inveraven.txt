go, General Grant, to render the intercourse between In-
veraven and his estate of Morange more easy and expedi-
tious, at his own expense caused a large road for carriages
and carts, to be made from Inveraven to Morange and
Glenlivet, over the hill of Carnocay, (a ridge of hill
extending from Bolrinnas, south-west to Aven, as far as his
right extended;) and when the road reached to the Duke of
Gordon's property, it was carried on by the statute-work of
the country.  Across this road runs the rivulet or burn of
Tommore in Inveraven, (which has its rise in the north-
west side of Belrinnas;) he, therefore, that it right to no
hindrance, at his own expense also, put a stone bridge of
two arches, 8 or 12 feet wide, over it; but, in a few years
afterward, (in 1782), the burn, when greatly swelled by
an impetuous torrent from the hills, undermined the foun-
dation, and carried it away, together with the meal-mill
and all its implements, (which was a quarter of a mile be-
low it on the same burn), into Aven.  This was a great loss
to the parish and travellers, as the burn, when it is big,
cannot be passed but by a bridge.  The Duke of Gordon also
caused a road for carriages to be made from Glenrinnas,
up through Glenlivet, to Tomantoul in Strathaven.

   Fish.-There come plenty of salmon up Spey; but they
are taken here only by the angling rod and line.  There
are also very good trouts in this river.  The salmon is sold
in the first of the year, at 4 d the pound; in June, it is sold at
2 1/2 d. and 2 d. the pound; and in July last summer it was
sold for 1 1/2 d. the pound.  A few small salmon go up Aven,
and there are large good trouts taken in it.  There are
trouts also in Livet, Tervey, and Cromby.

   Antiquities.-There were upon an eminence on the east
side of Aven, and ashort way up from the house of Ballen-
