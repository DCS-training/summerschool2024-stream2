      866                       PERTHSHIRE.

  Education.-No schools in the parish but the parish school,
which is in a flourishing state.  Salary, the maximum.  Probable
yearly amount of fees actually paid to schoolmaster, about L.21.
Probable amount of the other emoluments, about L.8 or L.9, in-
cluding salary as session-clerk and beritors' clerk.  There is a
small piece of ground, about seven acres, adjoining to the minister's
glebe, which was mortified by a Mr William Bell, minister here,
1641, and afterward conveyed to the parish of Errol, for the
purpose of maintaining a student of divinity ; the management and
disposal of this mortification is in the bands of the presbytery of
Perth, who let the lands, and appoint the rent to be paid annually
as a bursary to the student whom they have chosen, and who
continues in the possession of it for four years.  The bursars are
obliged to attend the university of St Andrews.  The present
rent of these lands is about L.21, exclusive of all public burdens,
but subject to a deduction of one-fifth for stipend.  Ministers' sons
in the presbytery are preferred to all others.
  Public-Houses.-There are three public-bouses in the parish.
Poor.-Average number of persons receiving parochial aid,
9 or 10, besides one in the lunatic asylum. Average sum allotted
to each of such persons per week or year, about L.3, 15s. per
annum. Average annual amount of contributions for relief of
the poor, L.60. From the poverty of the greater part of the po-
pulation, and the total want of resident heritors, the collections
are small ; average, about L.6 or L.7. There is no legal assess-
ment, but the beritors voluntarily assess themselves for the sup-
port of the poor to the amount, at present, of L.53 or 1,.54, of
which L.23 are for a lunatic in the Pertb Asylum.
