   There is marle in the parish.  Lime, from cumberland, is
delivered in the different bays at 1 s. the Carlisle bushel,
which is equal to three Winchester bushels; and sea shells at
1 s. 0 d per ton.  Sea shells are the best of all manures; and
in this neighbourhood they are inexhaustible.  Every tide,
accompanied by an east wind, brings in great quantities of this
most valuable commodity.  With these different manures,
rich crops and fine cattle are raised; but, if the present treat-
ment of a most generous soil be persisted in, there is a reason
to believe that it will be much injured.  Three, and some
times four crops of oats, or barley, succeed each other; and
with the last of these crops grass seeds are sown which are
cut for hay in the following year.  Thus four, and some-
times five, white crops follow one another; for a cop of rye
grass is as severe as a crop of oats, and therefore may be called
a white crop.

   When the land is laid down with grass seeds, it common-
ly lies six years.  Fallowing, in this part of the country, is
little practiced; and green crops are but small, and few in
number; the fields, therefore, become very dirty.  A partial
fallow in the spring, and early in May, is of great use in
cleaning the fields.  It is often followed by a rich crop of
light grain; and is particularly serviceable in preparing land
for grass.  This is almost the only fallow used here.

   Carts are used in carrying merchants goods, manures,
grain, etc. etc.  The small plough is used, sometimes with,
and sometimes without a chain; but for coarse strong land,
a large plough is thought necessary.
