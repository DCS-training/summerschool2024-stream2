sparingly covered with vegetable mould. This is particularly the
case towards the shores of the Clyde, where, in some instances, it
is thinly strewn upon the rock. On the higher land it becomes
deeper, and often rests upon till. The hills present a surface of
elevated moor, rarely interrupted by moss or rock, a considerable
part of which might be rendered arable. The vale of Leven con-
sists of a channelly alluvial soil, of sufficient depth and fertile qua-
lity.
  Climate.--The climate is healthy, and free from predisposing
tendency to any particular diseases. It partakes of the same ge-
neral character which is observable over the south-west coast of
Scotland, being mild and humid, with frequent showers rather
than heavy rains. Frost is seldom severe or long-continued, and
heavy falls of snow are almost unknown. The annexed table,
constructed from careful observation by Mr Dunlop of Keppoch,
will afford a view of the weather for the seven years from 1826 to
1832.*

                     II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
  No general history of this parish has been given to the public.
There have, however, been compiled two statistical accounts of
Dumbartonshire, from which much information applicable to Car-
dross, may be collected. The former of these was drawn up by
Mr David Ure for the Board of Agriculture in 1794; the other
published in 1811, and was the join production of the Re-
verend Andrew White, minister of Kilmarnock, and the Very Re-
verend Principal Macfarlan of the University of Glasgow. The
localities of the parish may also be illustrated from the map of the
county as surveyed by Mr John Wood in 1818.
  Situated at a distance from the capital, and from all the usual
royal residences, as well as from the ceaseless wars that ravaged

<FOOTNOTE>Mr Dunlop's table since 1832 presents very similar results, and need not be
