now to be the systems most generally adopted for preparing
the land to bear to crop of wheat.

   Beans and pease, singly or mixed together, are raised in
considerable quanties; part is sown in drills, and regularly
horse hoed, though this practice is far from being general.
Oats are still much cultivated, though not in so great a pro-
portion to other grain as formerly.  Dutch oats have, in
some places, lately been substituted instead of barley; as they
are well adapted to late sowing, and thus enable the farmer
to work his land in the same manner as for barley.  A large
quantity of barley was formerly raised in this district, where
the whole dung of the farm yard was usually put on the bar-
ley land, which with frequent ploughings, insured a lucrative
return.  But of late, the dung being almost entirely allotted
to the wheat, the barley has declined in quality, and be-
come so unprolific, that some farmers have entirely given up
that article, substituting in its place Dutch oats as before
mentioned.  The quantity of barley produced in the parish,
is, however, by no means trifling.

   Potatoes form a great article of produce, the vicinity of
Edinburgh affording an opportunity of disposing of them to
advantage.  There are some turnips, cabbages, carrots, and
yams, cultivated here, though the quantity is very small.
The yams are a very productive crop, never yielding less
than 50 boils, and sometimes 100, of 28 stones each, per
acre, even without dunging the land.  No part of the pasture
ground is let at less than 30 s. an acre, and some yields a
rent of 45 s. and 50 s. the produce is therefore moderately
estimated at 40 s. per acre.
