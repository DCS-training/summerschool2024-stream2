assist them in carrying on their improvements.  From the diffi-
culty, also, of finding houses, as subtenants, for their wives asd
families, married ploughmen are in a manner debarred from ac-
cepting engagements in Crimond, and thus both the worldly pro-
sperity and respectability of the people must be so far, retarded by
an excess of zeal in the prevention of pauperism.
   Emigration has not hitherto prevailed to any extent in Crimond,
but may be considered on the increase.  As there is not even a
village in the parish, the population is entirely rural In the ab-
sence of a correct register of marriages and deaths, the yearly
average may be stated as follows:

   Character of the People.-The common people are in general
cleanly both in their persons and houses; and their styie of dress,
in regard to neatness and comfort, has undergone much improve-

reading, especially newspaper reading, is much on the increase
Attendance on the ordinance of religion is most exemplary, and,
with the exception of the lowest class of men and women-servants,
often thrown promiscuously together, with none to care for their
best interests, they may with propriety be called a moral people.
   Since the establishment of the preventive force at Rattray Head,
about the year 1825, smuggling from foreign parts has been alto-
gether unknown on the Crimond shore.
