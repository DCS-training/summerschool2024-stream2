a great measure, alleviate this grievance; and if the far-
mers could use coal, instead of peats, they might employ
their servants for very useful purposes, such as, making 
kelp, building walls, making inclosures, composts, etc. etc.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The Gaelic is the only lan-
quage commonly spoken here, and I believe the purest 
dialect of it to be met with in any country; though by
their frequent excursions to Glasgow, the people have in-
troduced a number of English words.  Numbers of the in-
habitants, who attended the school, speak English tolerably 
well.- There are 200 tons kelp sent annually to the mar-
kets of Liverpool and Leith, and fetch the best price 
that is given for any that is sent from any part of the 
Highlands; fish and oil are sent to Glasgow; price as for-
merly mentioned. There are also from 200 t0 250 head
of cattle sold to drovers, at an average, about L. 2, 5 s. a-
head, great and small, besides about 100 hides of beef sent 
to Glasgow, or sold on the nearest part of the continent.
The number of horses is 557; cows, 1170, the num-
ber of soums in sheep, 277, which, at the rate of 8 sheep to 
the soum, is 2216.-The weather is rather inconstant.  The 
W. and S. W. winds blow most frequently here, and prove
very destructive to corn.  This last winter was very wet
and stormy, much the same with that 1790, both which 
have been the most distressing to the people here, in the 
memory of any man living.  We have had very little 
snow this winter or spring, and none at all the two pre-
ceding.  The sea seems to have made some encroachments 
here.  The tradition here is, that 3 or 4 generations back,
the cattle used to seed in places, where kelp is made at this
day; but now it can hardly go any farther, as the shore 
along the west coast, (where the sea could have made any 
progress formerly), is almost all rocky, and may serve as a
