     Statistical Account

parish cannot be well ascertained, as it is parted among
near an hundred small heritors, many of whom labour
their own small portions; but the valued rent is 1696 L.
3 s. 11 d. Scots.  The glebe in Harray may be worth about
45 L. Scots.  The church of Harray got a thorough repair
in the year 1778, but has never been touched since; so
that if not attended to, I suppose, it will soon be where
it was.  We have a number of poor, but no funds;
scarce being able to pay our clerk and officers.
   The number of ploughs in the parish is about 57,
together with 20 carts, drawn by one ox each:  One
standing stone, without any tradition concerning it:
Many Pictish castles, all in ruins; they seem to have
served for watch towers and fortalices in ancient times,
but they could have saved nothing but lives and house-
hold goods; they could not have preserved cattle, as
their dimensions were too small.  The people in general
in this parish are about the middle size, few above it.
Property is shifting sometimes from hand to hand, but
mostly in trifling bits.
   The people are as well contented as poor people can
be expected; can put a new suit of clothes upon their
backs now and then, partly of their own making, and
partly bought; and can make a feast, at a wedding or a
christening, on their own provisions, with a drink of
their own ale.-The enclosures are much the same as in
Birsay.-The poverty of Harray was very great in some
late bad years; insomuch that I divided 8 bolls of
meal into 96 parts, and every person that applied got
according to their need; they, in these years, certainly
lived very miserably, mostly upon milk and cabbage,
but none died.-In this parish, there is 1 school, at pre-
sent vacant, partly maintained by a mortification given
