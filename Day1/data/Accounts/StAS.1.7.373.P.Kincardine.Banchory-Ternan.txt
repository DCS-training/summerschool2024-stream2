demical fevers are not unfrequent.-The small-pox is seldom
mortal, even in the natural way.

   Church, School, and Poor.-In the year 1775, there was an
elegant new church built.  The manse is very old; its age
unknown.  The glebe and toft want more than one-fourth
of an acre of the legal extent.  The stipend is about 42 l.
Sterling, with 4 chalders of victual, one-third bear, beside
the annualrent of 100 l. Sterling, mortified for behoof of the
minister, by Dr Alexander Reid, whose father had been a
minister here.
   There is a school for teaching Latin, English, writing, and
arithmetic; and what is singular, no part of the salary is paid
by the heritors or tenants.  It is 16 l. Sterling; which, with
1 l. Sterling set apart for upholding the school-house, is an-
nualrent at at 4 1/2 per cent. of a sum mortified by said Dr Reid,
and of 50 l. Sterling by another gentleman.  The whole
was originally intended for the subsistence of a head master,
and two assistants.  There is also a woman's school, for the
education of young girls; the fund for the maintenance of
the mistress is 2000 merks, mortified also by Dr Reid.
   The poor at present are 80 in number, which high propor-
tion is very much occasioned, by the more than common pro-
vation made for them here, by which industry is abated, and
strangers induced to obtain a settlement in the parish, while
a degree of discontent and envy is unhappily excited in the
minds of the poor.  Hence it might be inferred, that it would
be better they were relieved by charitable cotemporaries, to
the advancement of sympathy in the one, and of gratitude in
the other.  The funds are 350 l. Sterling, mortified by one of
the family of Leys, for the benefit of the poor on that estate
in the parish; 100 l. Sterling by Dr Reid; 100 l. by Alex-
ander Shank of Castlerig, a son of one of the ministers; and
