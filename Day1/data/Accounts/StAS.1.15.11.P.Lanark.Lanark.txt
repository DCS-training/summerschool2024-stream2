cadzow, Coldstream and Zuilshieds, to Balstane near
Carluke, bearing the name of Watling-street, or rather
Biggar road; and from thence to the wall.
   About a mile North of Lanark, and upon the very
brink of Cartlane rocks, on the North of the Mouss, are
the vestiges of an old stronghold, called by some Castle-
dykes, and by others the castle of the Quaw.  Perhaps
from the Gaelic Uaidh, a cave, in allusion to the caves
or strange artificial archways afterwards to be noticed.
There are still evident traces of a wide, or rather a
double ditch on the land side, which incloses about half
a rood of ground, and on the side next to the river is a
precipice upwards of 200 feet of perpendicular height.
The well was very evident about 40 years ago, but
is since filled up.  There are at present no remains of
any building, excepting some slight traces like a foun-
dation, and some artificial caves or arched ways of a
very singular construction: one of them, which I
saw opened, was about 7 or 8 feet in length, and 4 feet
wide, running in a bending direction towards the center
of the inclosure from the brink of the rock; the height
about 3 1/2 feet.  This archway was composed of huge
blocks of freestone, rude and unpolished, intermixt with
the common moorstone of the country.  It was not
arched at top; but the stones laid horizontally one above
another, still approaching nearer and nearer, till the sides
formed a junction, and united at the top.  In the bottom of
the archway was a fat black earth intermixed witht some
bones in the state of ashes.  Several other archways, or holes
like the above, running in different directions, still exist,
although not hitherto explored.  The most remarkable
thing attending these vestiges is, that no lime or mortar,
nor the smallest appearance of lime rubbish is to be found
