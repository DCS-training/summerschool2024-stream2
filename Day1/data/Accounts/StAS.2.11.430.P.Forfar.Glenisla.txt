tions are, for the most part, young, and consist chiefly of larch and
Scotch fir, to which sorts of timber the soil appears most congenial.
  Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land per imperial
acre may be estimated at L.1. To the arable, however, is com-
monly annexed a portion of hill ground, or the privilege of mountain
pasture. The charge for grazing is, in the lower district, at the
rate of L.2 per ox or cow, and in the upper district, on hill and
bog pasture, from 12s. to 14s.; for a full-grown sheep, 1s. 6d.
  Live-Stock.-The numbers of cattle, sheep, and horses are
nearly as follows, viz. 281 horses, 1785 cattle, and 9680 sheep.
The cattle are of the Angus and Highland breeds. The sheep
are of the black-faced breed, and are brought, for the most part
when young, from the Linton and Lan`rj markets.

  Husbandry.-The rotation of cropping generally observed
throughout the parish is that of six years, viz. 1. fallow; 2. corn
sown out with grass seeds; 3. and 4. grass; 5. and 6. corn. This
mode of cropping is, however, in many instances, about to give way
to a rotation of seven years. The land will thus remain three
years in grass,-a period of rest which seems necessary in order
to keep it in a favourable state of production.

  The general duration of leases is fourteen years,-a term which
is obviously less favourable than one of nineteen to an active and
industrious tenant.

  Twenty-two of the proprietors farm their own lands. The farms
vary in size from 8 to 200 acres and upwards, exclusive of untilled
ground. Great attention, is now paid to their drainage and cul-
ture. In the southern district especially, they are well laid out.
Much has yet to be done in the way of fencing, although, in re-
gard to a few of the larger farms, the fields are well enclosed.
The farm-buildings are in general suitable to the possessions, and
in tolerable repair. Several of them are of recent erection, and
are at once substantial and commodious.

  Provision and Waqes.-The priced of provisions and rate of
wages in 1791 and 1838 may be stated as under.
