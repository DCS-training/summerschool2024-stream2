     Statistical Account

   Population.-By a late survey, it is found that there are is
this parish 2750 souls; and it is supposed that the popula-
tion has not increased much for 40 years; but no exact ac-
counts of it have been kept.  The return to Dr Webster in
1755 was 2728 souls.

   Schools.-In the town of Dunblane there are, besides the
parochial school, three others, to which the generality of the
people send their children to be initiated in the principles of
the English language, previous to their being sent to the
principal school.  Owing to the extent of the parish, there
are three other schools in different quarters of it, for the
accommodation of those who cannot come into the town.
The number of scholars at the parish school is, at an ave-
rage, about 60.  The schoolmaster's salary is 12 L Sterling
in money, and 7 stones of cheese, a house, and garden, in
value about 6 l. Sterling.  He is likewise session-clerk.  The
perquisites of which office are, including the salary, about
10 L Sterling.

   Alehouses, Inns, etc.-There are no less than 41 houses
where ale and spirits are retailed, 29 in the town of Dun-
blane, and 12 in other parts of the parish.  These are the
causes of misery and poverty prevailing among many of the
lower rank, who, laying aside their industry, become dissi-
pated and abandoned, and at last, through disease, age, and
infirmity, become, with their families, a burden upon the
parish.  In this manner the number of poor has increased
much of late years.  The greatest number of those upon the
roll are virtuous labouring people, who are aged and infirm;
but there are among them several of the above description.
