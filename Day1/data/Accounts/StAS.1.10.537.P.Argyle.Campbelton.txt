first; athough the many fragments of elegant crostes found
here, (which were so numerous as to give their name to the
adjacent farm,) give reason to believes that the church was
much frequented, and the saint of no ordinary same.  Of
Coivin's exalted merit, a most honourable testimony may be
seen in a Gaelic address, or invocations to him, preserved in
the ancient missal already mentioned, and beginning with
'O Coivin, now with Archangels,' etc.
   These two saints, however, Couslan and Coivin, though
both of an unquestionable piety, seem to have had ideas on
some subjects totality different.  Couslan, for instance, incul-

his time, as in our own); and if lovers did not yet find it
convenient to marry, their joining hands through a hole in
a rude pillar near his church, was hold as it continued to be
till almost the present days an interim tie of mutual fidelity,

country, none ever broke it, who did not soon after break
his neck, or meet with some other fatal accident.

proposed, that all who did not find themselves happy and
contented in the married states, should be indulged with the
opportunity of parting, and making a second choice.  For
that purpose he instituted an annual solemnity, at which all
the unhappy couples in his parish were to be at his
church; and, at midnight, all present were sufficiently blind-
solded, and ordered to surround the church those times at
full speed, with a view of mixing the lots in the urn.  The
moment that ceremony was over, without allowing an instant
to recover from confusuion, the word cubbag (seize quickly)
was pronounced; upon which every man laid hold of the first
female he met with whether old or young, handsome or ugly,
