as should reasonably be done, the average expense to each family,
cannot be reckoned less than L. 4 per annun.  Supposing that,
out of 768 families, 500 import their fuel in this manner, we have
an annual expense of L.2000 in the article of fuel alone.  Coll is
more fortunate in this respect.  There the people have fuel
enough and to spare, which costs them nothing but their labour.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church is by no means conv-
niently placed for the greater part of the population, being situat-
ed in a corner, four and a half miles distant from one extremity of
the island, and eight and a half from the other.  It was built in
the year 1776, and enlarged in 1786; and, though it has under-
gone several repairs of late years, it cannot be said to be in a suf-
ficient state.  It may accommodate about 500 persons, but was
never regularly seated.  All the seats are free.
   The manse was built in 1832, and, being found insufficiently
executed, was repaired in 1838.  It is still far from being com-
fortable.  The glebe contains about 30 acres, the land being
mostly of very inferior quality.  It is not worth L.5 per aunum.
The stipend amounts to 213 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 7/9 lippies bear;
70 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 1 1/3 lippies meal; and L.395, 17s. 6d,
Scots money, burdened with an annual tack-duty of L.22, 4s. 5d.
to the Synod of Argyle, and also with a salary to an assistant, as
will presently be stated.
   There are no Government churches or missionaries in the parish;
but there is an assistant residing in Coll, who has a legal provision
of L.58O, 2s. 6d. Scots money, 11 bolls, 2 firlots bear, and 3 bolls,
3 friots, 1 peck, 1 1/3 lippies meal, varying of late years from L.62
to L.65 per annum.  The church there is situated about the mid-
dle of the island, was built about the year 1802, and is in tolera-
ble condition.  It accommodates about 350 sitters.  There is one
catechist in the parish connected with the Established Church,
and having a small salary from the funds of the Synod of Argyle.
There are no Episcopalians or Catholics; but there are some
Dissenters, chiefly of the Independent persuasion, and a few Bap-
tists, each sect having a preacher and meeting-house of their own,
When the last list was made out, they consisted of 13 families, of
which 3 or 4 were Baptists.  Some families have joined them
since.  The Baptist emissary, a self-authorized preacher, is em-
ployed, as I am informed, by the Baptist Missionary Society at a
salary of L.20 per annum.  The Independent, when inquiry was
made, declined to give any information as to the means or amount
