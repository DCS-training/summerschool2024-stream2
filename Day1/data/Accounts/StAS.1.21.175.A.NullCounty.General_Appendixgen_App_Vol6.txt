     The Statistical Account.

there may be seen hundreds, men, women, and children,
bouring with the utmost assiduity.  The women declare they
can make more by working at the moss than at their wheel
and such is their general attachment to that employment,
that they have frequently been discovered working by moon-
light.
   Another happy consequence arising from their numbers
is the great quantity of moss they consume for fuel.  There
are in all 115 families.  Each family requires at an average
10 dargues* of peats yearly.  Each darg uncovers a space
equal to 10 square yards of clay: so that by casting peats, the
moss tenants gain yearly about 6 roods of land.
   The advantage, too, of providing their fuel with so little
trouble, is very great.  They require yearly 1150 dargs of
peats; which, as each darg when dried and stacked is va-
lued at five shillings, are worth 287 10 s. sterling; a sum
which otherwise must have been expended on the prime cost
and carriage of coals.  Many of them cast peats for sale; and
100 l. worth are yearly disposed of in the town of Stirling,
the village of Down, etc.
   Though moss-work be laborious, it is at the same time
amusing.  The operator moves the moss five feet only at a
medium; and the water, like carts in other cases, carrying
it off as fast as it is thrown in, excites him to activity.  Still
he must submit to be wet from morning to night.  But ha-
bit reconciles him to this inconvenience; while his house
and arable land fill his eye and cheer his mind.  Nor is it
found that the health of the inhabitants is in the smallest de-
gree injured either by the nature of the work or the vicinity
of the moss.

<FOOTNOTE>

*A dargue (or darg) of peats, is the quantity that one man can cast and
two can wheel in a day to the field where they are spread out to dry.
