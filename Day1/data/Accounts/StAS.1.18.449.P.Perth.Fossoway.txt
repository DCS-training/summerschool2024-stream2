in Mr Graham, by a special grant from the crown.  The
present incumbent was ordained on Mr Graham's presenta-
tion, 11th of May 1780.

   Church, Manse, Glebe and Stipend.-The church and manse,
as formerly mentioned, were built in their present situation,
in 1729.  The church is neither commodious, nor in good
repair, although it has received frequent reparations since it
was built.  The manse and office-houses were rebuilt in the
year 1781, and are neat and convenient enough; but not so
sufficiently executed, as might have been expected from the
sum of money expended on them.  Heritors, when they are
building churches or manses, ought to endeavour to have them,
at least, substantially finished.  This would in the end, save them
a good deal of expence.  One would imagine, that a manse,
which costs L. 300, might be so built, as to stand at least a
century.  This, however, Was not the case with the former
one at Fossaway, which was thrown down in its 51st year, by
consent of the heritors, who were wearied out in repairing it.
Owing to the peculiar situation of this country, the greater
part of the houses stand nearly east and west; and as the most
violent weather, and greatest hurricanes come from the west,
it is found to be a very hard talk to make the west gabel proof
against the rain.  Particular attention should be given to this
circumstance, in every house built in this part of the country.
   The glebe now occupied by the incumbent, is about 10
Scotch acres.  It was formerly a muir, and is a very poor
soil.  In the year 1729, it was purchased for L. 29: 8 s ster.
Its soil is a mixture of moss and gravels few inches deep in
many places; and lies partly on a bed of moss, but mostly on
a bed of very fine sand.
   The stipend of the parish consisted of 40 bolls; two thirds
meal, and one third bear; and L. 56: 13: 4 d ster. in money.
