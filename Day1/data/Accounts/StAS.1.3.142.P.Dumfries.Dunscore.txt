   Young children, for whom the mortcloth is not used, are
not included in the above.  The yearly average of burials is
about 17.  There are 76 farmers, including such proprietors
as either farm the whole or a part of their estates; 2 shep-
herds; 6 blacksmiths; 7 joiners; 11 masons; 7 shoema-
kers; 19 weavers; 6 taylors; 5 millers; and 1 clock and
watchmaker.  Of late, the number of inhabitants is consi-
derably increased, which may be owing to the farms being
made smaller, and the improvements of the land by lime from
Closeburn and Barjarg James Grierson, Esq; of Dalgoner
has also, of late years, granted a number of seus, which have
greatly augmented the number of inhabitants upon his e-
state.  The inhabited houses are 224; five persons in each
house may be nearly the average.

   Cattle and Sheep-The number of black cattle is nearly
1300; the number of sheep 3480; and the number of horses
218.  The black cattle, in general, are of the Galloway
breed; but Mr Robert Burns, a gentleman well known by
his poetical productions, who rents a farm in this parish, is
of opinion, that the west country cows give a larger quantity
of milk.
