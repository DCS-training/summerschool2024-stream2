     Of Dysart.

   Brewery and Ropery.-In the former, about 1000 bolls of
barley are malted annually, mostly the growth of this county.
About 2500 barrels of ale and beer are brewed, from 10 s. to
36 s. the barrel, value 2150 L.  A considerable quantity of
this is sold in* Kirkcaldy, to which the brewery pays 40 L.
annually, impost.  A manager and 4 labouring servants are
employed.  An addition is now making to the works, to
carry on a distillery there.  In the latter, about 6 men are
employed in making small ropes.

   Domestick Commerce.-There are 4 annual fairs in Dysart,
one for linseed, one for white cloth, one for white cloth and
wool, and one for black cattle.  In Pathhead, one for white
cloth and wool. In Galaton, one for white cloth.  About
50 years ago, great quantities of cloth were exposed at these
fairs, and bought by merchants from Edinburgh, Glasgow,
and Stirling.  This trade has gradually fallen off; and very
little business is now done at any of the fairs, except that for
black cattle.  Less white cloth is made in Fife than formerly,
so many of the weavers being taken up in the check and tick
manufacture:  and the merchants choose rather to pick up
the cloth at the bleachfield, than after it has been dressed for
the market.  The wool market too is entirely gone.  For-
merly many families spun wool, and made cloth for their
own wearing:  now English cloth is generally worn.  And
since enclosing became general, very few sheep are kept in
Fife.  The easy intercourse by means of posts and carriers,
and shops being established in every little village, render fairs
less necessary.  Business is thus better managed.  When every
body resorted to the fairs, they were generally a scene of dis-
sipation.  Whatever day the fair began on, no business was done
