   Extent, Erection, Surface, etc.-This parish is very exten-
sive, being, from N. to S, about 12 miles; and, from E. to
W., about 10.  It is sometimes called Braemoray; and it was
anciently a vicarage to Forres, the seat of the Archdeacon of
Moray, and comprehended Ardclach, which was not erected
into a separate parish till the year 1638.  The face of the
country is in general hilly, but not mountainous:  The highest
hill in it, is called the Knock of Braemoray.  The height of
this hill, which is not considerable, has not been ascertained
by measurement.  Upon the banks of the rivers Findhorn and
Divie, there are some of the most romantic rural scenes, which
wood, water, rocks, and variety of ground can produce.

   Proprietors and Rent.-There are 5 proprietors; of whom
only 1 resides constantly in the parish, and another occasionally.
The valued rent of the parish is 1945 L. 8 s. Scotch:  The real
rent cannot be dated with any degree of accuracy.

   Rivers and Lake.-The Findhorn, already mentioned, is the
principal river in this parish.  It takes its rise in the hills,
betwixt those districts of Inverness-shire called Strather-rig and
Strathearn, above 50 miles from the sea; after traversing,
with amazing rapidity, a tract of mountainous country, in a
course nearly from S. W. to N. E., it discharges itself into
the Moray Frith, about 4 miles below Forres.  Over this
dangerous river, from its source to the sea, there are only at
present 2 bridges*; one upon the military road, from Avic-
