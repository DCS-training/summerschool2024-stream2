this century, or during the space of thirty-eight years; and as this
remarkable increase has t`ken place chiefly in the town, the po-
pulation of the landward part of the parish having remained al-
most stationary since the period of the first census, it may be re_
garded as a strong evidence of the flourishing state of the woollen
manufactures, to whose influence, in creating a demand for labour
and attracting operatives from other places, the increase in the po-
pulation is mainly to be ascribed.
   Habits and Customs.-Of the customs prevalent in this parish,
there is none certainly that is less deserving of notice, though none
that is more characteristic, than that of distinguishing individuals
by other than the names that properly belong to them.  This cus-
tom was at one time common to the whole district, and was no
doubt adopted in ancient times for the purpose of drawing a broad-
er line of distinction between individuals, who, belonging to the same
clan, and bearing the same name, were not unlikely, but for a de-
vice such as this, to be frequently confounded with one another.
And it is somewhat remarkable, that such fictitious designations
have remained often in the same family, and been handed down
from father to son in regular succession, through the course of
many generations.  Indeed there are some of the older inhabitants
of this parish, who in the ordinary intercourse of life have been so
long accustomed to the conventional usages of the place, that their
proper names are but seldom used, and by many of their neigh-
bours are altogether unknown.  And even in the register of deaths,
where it might have been supposed that the evidences of such a
strange custom were least likely to be traced, there is actually a
faithful record of the sobriquets by which the ancestors of the pre-
sent generation were commonly distinguished, a  record which,
however it may be viewed in other respects, does evidently prove
how completely the practice in question has been interwoven with
the habits of the people.
   It deserves also to be mentioned, though not peculiar to this pa-
rish, that, during the course of last century, it was the custom to
employ only one coffin at the interment of paupers.     This, as ap-
pears from the statements of some of the older inhabitants, was
used merely for the purpose of conveying them to their final rest-
ing-place, and was so constructed as to be capable of opening by
a hinge underneath, by which means the body was permitted  to
escape when lowered down into the grave.  It is not to be denied
that there is something  in  this mode of interment very much at
