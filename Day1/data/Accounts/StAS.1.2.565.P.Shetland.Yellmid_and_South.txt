     UNITED PARISHES OF MID AND

     SOUTH YELL.

     (IN SHETLAND.)

     By the Rev. MR. ANDREW DISHINGTON*.

     Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE united parishes of Mild and South Yell, are situated
in one of the most northerly of the Shetland islands.-
They extend, from north to south, above ten miles, and,
from east to west, about fix.  They contain in all about 1100
marks land, (as it is here called,) which will not much exceed
500 Scots acres.  The arable land principally consists of some
cultivated spots, lying along the sea-coast.  The inland parts
of the island are mostly hills, covered with peat moss.  There
is very little heath, but abundance of a rough sort of grass,

late periodical publications, but which the reader will probably be
glad to see reprinted, together with one from Mr Dishington himself,
