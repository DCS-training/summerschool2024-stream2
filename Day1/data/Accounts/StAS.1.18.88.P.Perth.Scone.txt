   To the southward of this lawn is the kitchen garden, en-
riched with all sorts of culinary vegetables, with fruit trees and
bushes, and ornamented with walks and flowers.  On the
west side of it is a romantic bower, which immediately calls
to our remembrance the fair Rosamond's.
   From the garden we pass into the nursery.  It is an oblong
park of about 2 acres, having a fine southern exposure, and
being surrounded by a number of tall and stately trees, which,
at the same time that they shelter the young plants, give the
place a remarkably pleasing and venerable air.
   On the south of the nursery is a hollow or den, planted on
each side, with shrubs and forest trees, and enlivened by a
small brook, which runs through it.  Along the side of this
brook is a winding gravel walk, which leads to the lawn, in
which the palace is situated.
   As the ground rises, the spectator, on the opposite side of
the Tay, sees every object distinctly, round, and swelling to
the eye.

He who, at any time got the ball into his hands, run with it
till overtaken by one of the opposite party, and then, if he
could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side,
who seized him, he run on: if not, he threw the ball from
him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party; but
no person was allowed to kick it.  The object of the married
men was to hang it, i. e. to put it three times into a small
hole in the moor, the deol or limit on the one hand; that of
the batchelors was to drown it, i. e. to dip it three times into
a deep place in the river, the limit on the other.  The party
