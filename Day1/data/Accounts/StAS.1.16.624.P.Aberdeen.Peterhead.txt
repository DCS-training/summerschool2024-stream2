     Statistical Account

   Review of Population.-Though the population of the
parish has already been mentioned, it may not be improper
to state the population of the town of Peterhead, and the
value of property at different periods.
   In 1593, there were only 14 feus, allowing to each fa-
mily 4, this makes the number of inhabitants at that time
56.  From an anonymous manuscript, I find in 1727 there
was supposed to be in the town about 230 families, which,
supposing it to be accurate, would make the inhabitants to
be at that time about 900.  In 1764, they were 1266; in
1769, they were 1518; in 1790, they were 2550; and at
present they are supposed to be about 3000.  Dr Laing
estimates them in 1764 at 1500; but this is a mistake, as
that year I visited every family in my parish, and I am
confident no list was taken that year, or in 1769, excepting
by myself.  The list in 1790 was taken by the managers
of the town, at which I was not present: of the accuracy
of it, however, I have no doubt.  From this statement
it will appear how rapidly this town has increased in po-
pulation these last 30 years.  In a few years, probably less
than 40 years from the time I took the first list, I make no
doubt the number of inhabitants will be trebled.

   Value of Feus at different Periods.-The value of the feus
and property in the town has increased very much; in
1593, from considering the charter, each acre appears to
have cost about L. 50 Sterling.  Since the Governors of
the Merchant Maiden Hospital became proprietors, they
have feued off land at the rate of 16 s. per fall, and 1 d.
of feu duty for every foot of front, or at L. 128 Sterling
per acre.  Now they have resolved to sell none under L. 1,
10 s. per fall, or at the rate of L. 240 per acre; with 1 d.
for every foot of front as feu-duty.  There are many in-
stances, howover, of much higher prices being paid in Pe-
