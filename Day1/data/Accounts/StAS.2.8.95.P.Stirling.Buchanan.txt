                     Dr Webster's return, 1755, gave 1699
                     Statistical Account  1799,      1611
                     Census               1801,       748
                     Do. 1831, (should have been)     600

  The number stated in last census is 787, which
rated. It was taken early in summer, when, besides the resident
population, there'were many women and children from the adja-
cent villages, and even from Greenock, employed in the annual.
cutting of oak copse : these were all included in the return to Go-
vernment. The real amount is stated in the table. The decrease
of the population is ascribed to the enlargement of farms, and to
the introduction of sbeep-husbandry.
  There is no villaoe in the parish. The whole population.may
be called agricultural ; for tliough there are about ten families of
tradesmen, none of them depends exclusively on his trade. There
is a register kept of baptisms, marriages, and deaths; but the first
is incorrect, as many parents omit to register their children, and
the ornission is calculated a- t one-sixth of the whole number.

         The yearly average for last seven years of births registered,  10

                                           of deaths,        7
                                           of Marriages      3

  In explanation of the marriages, or rather proclamation of banns,
it nilist be stated, tbattbe total number for the last seven years, where
both parties, and where the. male parties were parishioners, was
21,-tbus giving the average of three, as entered in the table : but
during the same period, there were also nine other proclarrLations,
where the female parties only were parishioners, which are exelud-
ed, as belonging to other parishes where the male parties reside..
  The people are sober, industrious, and religious. As the parish
is on the Highland border, a part of the inhabitants still retain the
Gaelic language. There are few, however, that do not understand
English.
