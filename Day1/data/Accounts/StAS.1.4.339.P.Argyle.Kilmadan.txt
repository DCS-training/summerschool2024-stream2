The population of the parish is diminished nearly one-half
from what it was 25 years ago.  The cuase is plainly this:
The propritors set their farms in a large extent to gra-
ziers, who can afford to pay a great rent; becuase 1 man
will herd the cattle on a farm which formerly supported 8
families.  They find also the sewer farmers in a farm, the
less that farm is burdened with the maintenance of fami-
lies; and that a great number of farmers cannot pay the
same rent that a few can.  Some families leave the parish
yearly; but for 20 years past, only 2 families belonging to
it have emigrated from Scotland.

   Produce, etc.-The parish produces oats, barley, peas,
potatoes, turnips, rye-grass, clover, garden-stuffs, fruit-trees,
barren trees.  There are between 5000 and 6000 sheep,
