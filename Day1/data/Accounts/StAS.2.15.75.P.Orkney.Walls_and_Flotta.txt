was, for several centuries, the seat of the family of Moodie, aod
bears the masks of strength and antiquity. The mansion-house of
Melsetter, formesly occupied by the late Major Moodie, the last pro-
prietor of the name, aod now by his son-in-law, Robest Heddle,
Esq. of Melsetter, is beautigully situated at the fasther extremity of
Longhope Bay- and commands a view of the eotraoces of the
Pentland Frith, the coast of Caithness, aod the high laods of the
west coast of Sutherlaod.
   Laod-owners.-The whole parish of Walls, with a small excep-
tion, belongs to the Crown and Mr Heddle,-the latter being the
proprietor of fully two-thirds of the property.
   Parochial Registers.-Unfortunately, there are few records in
the parish, and these do not extend to a remote date. It appears
that there have been five incumbents of Walls and Flotta, besides
the present minister, since 1688. The dates of the two first in-
ductions previous to 1707 are not given; their names, however,
are mentioned,-Mr Dalgarnock and Mr Andrew Kerr. Mr John
Keith was inducted in April 1707, Mr Edward Irving in August
1747, Mr James Bremner in March 1772, and the present minis-
ter in July 1837.

   I have not been able to ascertain with satisfaction to myself the
number of deaths, nor do I know whether those in Pharay are in-
cluded, nor if all those who have died or been lost at sea are re-
gistered.
   With few exceptions, the employments of the people consist of
farming and fishing, the same individuals generally pursuing both
occupations. Straw-plaiting is also. Carried on to a considerable
extent by the women.
