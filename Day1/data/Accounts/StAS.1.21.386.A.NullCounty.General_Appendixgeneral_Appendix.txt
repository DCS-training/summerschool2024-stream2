     General Appendix to

of deaths, in the city and its environs, an 1790:  yet the
result did only exceed the actual survey taken in 1791, by
38, as appeared from the public papers a few months after
that calculation was finished.
   The expectation of life derived from the above table, of
the probabilities of life adapted to Scotland in general, page
2d, is not only much inferior to that corresponding to the
Fife table of observations, but is also less, excepting at in-
fancy, than the expectation of life produced from an Edin-
burgh table, an. 1780.  From whence it may be inferred, that
the bills of mortality are the only proper sources from which
such tables of observations ought to be derived.
