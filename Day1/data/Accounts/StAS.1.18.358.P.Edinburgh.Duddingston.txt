     NUMBER XIII.

     PARISH OF DUDINGSTON.

     (COUNTY OF EDINBURG.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM BENNET.

     Name, Situation and Extent.

   DUDINGSTON is said to be a name of Gaelic origin,
and to signify the house on the sunny side of the hill.
However fanciful such etymologies in general may be, the
situation of the church corresponds in some sense with this
description.  It stands under the south cope of Arthur's Seat,
raised upon an eminence, which is embraced on the west
and south by the lake bearing the same name, and protected
on the north by the mountain.  The most beautiful and pic-
turesque scenery expands before it, and on every side.  The
views which it commands include every object which the
painter would select to compose a rich or a finished landscape.
Magnificent villas, towering castles, rich vallies, cultivated
fields, woods, groves, ruins; the lake below, the bold preci-
pices of Arthur's Seat behind; the hills of Pentland, Moor-
foot, and Lammermoor, bounding the prospect upon the
west and south; and the sea sinking in the distant horizon,
