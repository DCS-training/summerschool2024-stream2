                   PARISH OF CORSTORPHINE.*

            PRESBYTERY OF EDINBURGH, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND

              THE REV.  DAVID HORNE, MINISTER.

                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.-CORSTORPHINE, was anciently written Crostorfin or
Crostorfyn, as in the foundation charter of Holyrood House in
1128, and in Ragman's Roll of 1296.  Several derivations have
been proposed.  Chalmers in his Caledonia frequently refers to it
as a Celtic word, but in his description of the parish, he inter-
prets it as the Cross of Torphin, acknowledging at the same time
that he cannot trace any connection between Torphin, who was
grandson of Malcolm IL, and died in 1014, and this part of the
country.  It may, however, be noticed, in corroboration of this de-
rivation, that Torphin is the name of a large tract of country in
the district of West Calder.  Another derivation is from the Nor-
man or French words, "Crois d'ore fin," or cross of fine gold, and
this we think the more probable of the two, from the circumstance
that the earliest proprietors of Crostorfin were Normans, who, in
that age, were devoted friends of the church, and fond of the em-
blem of the cross.  Tradition likewise supports this derivation and
connects with it the existence of a golden cross in the chapel of
the estate in early times.
   Extent and Boundaries.-The present parish of Corstorphine
includes within its bounds part of the ancient parish of Gogar, the
remainder of which was annexed to the adjoining parishes of Kirk-
liston and Ratho. It also includes the lands of Ravelston and
Saughton, which were detached from St Cuthberts by the Teind
Commission of 1627, and united to Corstorphine in 1633, by an
act of the Scotch Parliament.  The parish is about 4 miles in
length, and its greatest breadth is about 2 1/4 miles. It is bounded-
on the north, by Cramond and Kirkliston; on the east, by St Cutb-
