and populous charge for one clergyman.  Coigach would com-
prehend two of these districts; one of which would be con-
sined to Ullapool and its environs, consisting of upwards of
1000 souls.  The Aird of Coigach would form another districts,
which is separated from the Ullapool district, by an extensive
track of moss, mountains, and rocks.  In this district there
are upwards of 600 souls; and some of the tenants there, with
the concurrence of the proprietor, made lately a very laud-
able attempt to obtain a mission from the SOCIETY for Pro-

glebe, which is the principal obstruction, it should never be
insisted on as a necessary condition for the establishment of a
mission.  In some cases, a missionary would not occupy a
glebe though he had it, and, in most places, if he was dis-

and that according to the present mode of settling missions
adopted by the Society, those places, that have most need,
have least chance of being provided with them.  The Society,
however, must have good reasons for their proceedings,
though it is to be regretted that the effects should thus,
though contrary to their intention, retard the object they
have in view to promote.  The enlightening of these be-
