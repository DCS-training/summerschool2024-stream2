a good extent.  But its industry is principally directed to the
manufacturing of cotton wool.  Besides about 50 mules and
jennies, managed by private hands, it has 4 mills in constant
employment; and will probably have 2 more in a short time.
Of those built, the 2 largest are twist mills; the 2 others are
mule mills.  The mule mills are 3 stories high, 70 feet by 20;
have about 130 mules each, which give employment to up-
wards 100 labourers.  The largest of the twist mills is
stories high, 120 feet by 30; and employs about 300 labour-
ers.  The other twist mill is 3 stories high, 84 feet by 32;
and is not yet completely set agoing.  There is also a cotton
factory, in which are wove muslins, and other cottons, of neat
patterns and good fabric*.

from Whitehaven, Newcastle, &c. and run from 30 s. to 40 s.

sary article, the inhabitants are often in absolute want.  This
tends to hurt the manufactures, as it causes many of the la-
bourers to remove; and will, when known, prevent strangers
from settling.  Employers would therefore consult their own
interest, would they adopt some method of supplying their
workmen constantly, and upon as moderate terms as possible.
The duty upon coals was a frequent, and just came of com-
plaint which, since the commencement of this account, has
been; happily removed.
