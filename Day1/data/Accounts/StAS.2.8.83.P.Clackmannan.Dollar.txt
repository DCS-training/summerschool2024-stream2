limestone, is about 1730 yards, and its greatest breadth, measur-
ed from the crops of the same coal, is out 960 yards, of which
the breadth from the line of the trough to the south crop is 672
yards, and from the trough to the north crop, is only 288 yards,
The surface of the ground from the mountain foot declines
gently towards the river Devon, and forms haughs or holms along,
both sides of the river. From these holms the ground again rises
to the south, forming a steep brow; from the top of which there
is a considerable extent of table or flat land reaching to the south
side of the parish. In this flat land, is found the Sheardale coal-
field already mentioned. The only difference regarding the beds
of coal, compared with those of the Dollar coal-field, is that, in the,
Sheardale Coalfield, no smithy coal or anthracite is to be found.
  The organic, remains found here are the same as are found ge-
nerally in the coal -fields of Scotland ; but no organic remains are
found in any of the rocks which compose the Ochills.
  In both coal-fields, the following coals have been found above the
mountain limestone, the place of section being at Kelly Burn, the east
boundary of Dollar parish, and at the deepest part of the trough:

  These coals are a mixture of splint and cubical coal, suitable
for household use and furnaces, with the exception of the smithy
coal, which is part of the main coal, gradually changing its quality
into the smithy or blind coal, as it approaches the mountain rock.
  Sandstone has been wrought on both sides of the Devon. The
quarry at Sheardale has been wrought to a considerable extent. A
good specimen of this rock is seen in the Academy of Dollar.
The sandstone on the north-side of the Devon has not been much
used for a number of years; but at present it is being quarried
at Quarrel-burn quarry, west from the town of Dollar, with a
