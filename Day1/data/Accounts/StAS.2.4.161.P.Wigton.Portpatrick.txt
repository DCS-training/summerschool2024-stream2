the purposes of orderly refreshment and comfortable accommo-
dation.
	Fuel.-,About 300 tons of coal, chiefly from Troon and Ayr,
are consumed yearly by the inhabitants, at the rate of about 14s.
or 15s. per ton. The fuel chiefly used is peat, procured from
mosses in the parish, and usually sold in the town at from 1s. 8d.
to 2s. per cart load.

			MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa-
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac-
count, have been already adverted to. The want of coal must pre-
vent the introduction of manufactures to any considerable extent:
but the condition of the working-classes would undoubtedly be im-
proved if it were found profitable to introduce hand-loom weaving.
The purity of the sea water here would render Portpatrick a de-
sirable watering-place in the summer months, if baths were erect-
ed, and pains were taken to improve the bathing-ground, which
could be easily done by quarrying a little of the rock in various
places where nature has already almost formed plunge-baths on the
shore. There is a very pure and mild summer atmosphere; the
purest fresh water; one chalybeate spring; an admirable prome-
nade of the piers, which are paved and dry in all weather; abun-
dance of fish; easy communication with the markets of Stranraer,
Donaghadee, or Belfast; excellent houres for lodging; a daily
post; and, in good weather, facilities for travelling to all parts of
the three kingdoms.
