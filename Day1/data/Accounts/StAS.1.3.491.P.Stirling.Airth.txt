November, the second in March, and the last in the end of
April or begining of May.  Previous to the last, a quantity
of lime and dung is spread upon the fields.  The effects of
lime are particularly beneficial; in hard clay ground, it
separates the stiff particles from each other; and, if the soil
is soft and wet, it sucks up the exuberant moisture.  The
farmer should be very attentive, as to the time and manner
of putting lime on his barley fields.  Perhaps the best time
is the beginning of November, when the ground should be
plowed with a very thin and slight surrow, as the lime natu-
rally rinks into it.  By its being put on at this season, the fa-
line particles, and hot burning quality of the lime, are ab-
sorbed by the earth, and incorporated with it through the
winter; whereas, is it be deferred till after the second or
third plowing, a little advantage is derived from it that season;
and in cafe of much drought, it is often found to be hurtful.
There is a prejudice entertained by many farmers, that lime
is not beneficial to light fandy ground. This opinion may
be presumed to proceed from the want of a fair trial; for it
is well known, that lime incorporates with fand, and tends to
consolidate its small particles, and to give the ground a pecu-
liar strenght and firmness.  The farmers often roll their bar-
ley fields with a heavy wooden or stone roller:  This, in a
dry season, is of great use, as it tends to preserve the mois-
ture in the ground, and hinders the drought from penetrat-
ing into it; but if heavy rains fall soon after the rolling, it is
necessary to open the surface with the harrow.  It may be
observed, that the barley sowm in April is the strongest grain;
but that sown in the middle of May is the most prolific.
Beans and pease are sown in the beginning of March,
the oats immeadiately after.  Ploughmen's wages. at present
are from 8 L. to 10 L. per annum.  Those of servant maids,
