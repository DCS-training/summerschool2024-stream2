   Swedish Turnip.-It may not be improper in this place to
mention that the Ruta Baga, or the Swedish turnip, has been
cultivated with considerable success by the two heritors of this
parish.  In a country like this, where stock occupies so
much attention, and renders such benefit to the farmer,
some root or plant seems wanting to give to the cattle,
between the time that the turnips begin to shoot, and of
course, to cease to afford nourishment, and the coming in of
the grass.  The ruta baga seems admirably calculated for
that purpose.  For besides being later of shooting than the
turnip, it loses not its nutritive qualities after it has shot, but
retains all its juices and solidity:  Whereas it is well known
that a turnip, after it has put forth its flower, becomes dry,
light, and reedy, and in every respect unfit for feeding either
cattle or sheep.  Horses too seem very fond of it; and one of
the gentlemen above alluded to, has this winter given them to
his out-lying young horses, who eat them with great eager-
ness.  He was led to try this experiment, from observing
that when these young horses broke out of the field, they
constantly fed on the ruta baga, though in the same field
there was a large quantity of turnips, which they never of-
fered to touch.  Another extraordinary quality of the ruta
baga is, that it seems impossible to make it rot; though bit or
trod upon by cattle or horses, it never rots, but whatever part
of the root is left, nay, if scooped out to the shell, it remains
perfectly fresh, and in spring puts out a new stem.  It is
needless to observe that the opposite of this obtains with
the turnip.  The culture too of this valuable root is perfectly
simple:  When first attempted in this parish, the gentlemen
