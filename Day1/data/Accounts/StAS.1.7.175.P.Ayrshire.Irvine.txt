an excellent quality, make a very quick and cheerful fire;
and, answering the purposes of baking and brewing better

   Considerable quantities of woollen carpets and carpetins,

suburbs or annexed part of the parish, the numbers in the
town having rather decreased, owing to the taking down of
some old houses, each of which contained many families;
whereas the new ones built in their place are occupied by
