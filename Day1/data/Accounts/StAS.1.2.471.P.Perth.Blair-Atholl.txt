     of Blair-Atholl and Strowan.

the common people have learned to despite a soldier's pay,
and to hate a life of servitude, yet they have still a deal of the
martial spirit remaining, and make very good soldiers, when
once they undertake it; being firm, hardy, and brave, though
not generally tall.  Seven or eight hundred of them attended
the Marquis of Montrose, till after the battle of Kilsyth, and
signalized themselves by their fidelity and valour.  With re-
gard to religion, they have not many dispute, nor do they
make much noise about it; but, in general, they attend the
church, and religious ordinances, with gravity, decency, and
every appearance of sincerity; and many of them enter
deeply into some of the most important points of controversy
among Christians.

   Language.-The Gaelic language is spoken here, by the
natives; and there are but few others in the parish.  It was
in all probability, the first language spoken in this country.
That it gave the antient names to places is clear.  There are,
indeed, a few names, such as dour, cabar, Etc. that are as
common among the Welsh, as among us; but whether these
names have been originally given by a colony of Welsh, or by
the Caledonians, or Picts, the people themselves appear to
have been only different colonies of the same Celtae or Gael*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*These names, by the by, seem to come from two words of
the same signification, viz.  Coill, or Coille, and Gad, a wood.
From Coille comes Coilltich, ( Keatai ), Inhabitants of the Woods.
From Gad, in Scots Gaelic, signifying a Withe or Twig, in
Welsh, a Wood, come Gaidbiol ( Gad-gbiola ), Gadelians ( or Giade-
lians), Galli, and Gadeni, names given to the Gaidheil, or Gael of
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; all signifying Men of the Wood;
