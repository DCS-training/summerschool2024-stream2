     Statistical Account

the northern division of that well-known ridge of moun-
tains.  It is bounded on the east by the parishes of Aber-
dalgie, Forgandenny, and part of Arngask; on the west, by
Dunning, Findo-Gask, and a part of Forgandenny that
runs westward between the Ochil part of this parish and
the rest of it; on the north, by Tibbermor; and on the
south, by Orwell.  It is computed to be eight miles in
length, by two in breadth.  Hilltown and Mailler, another
district of the parish, is also entirely cut off from the rest
by two intervening parishes, at the distance of about three
or four miles.  The improper subdivision of parishes, with
relation to one another, with respect to their several
churches, and the conveniency of their inhabitants, is so
general all over Britain, that it almost ceases to be viewed
as an absurdity.  Our laudable veneration, however, for the
indisputable wisdom, and mature judgment of our ances-
tors, in marking, with great precision, the limits of these
notable districts, and the irremediable confusion that would
necessarily follow, were any alteration made on them,
should effectually restrain us from ever attempting to disturb
their established order.

   Name.-The name of this place is generally written For-
teviot.  In Fordun and others, it is Fortheviot, Forthe-
vioth, and Forteviach.  This name is asserted by some
authors to be a contraction of Forthuir-tabiaicht, Gaelic,
from FAirthir, farther or remote; and tabachta, state or
condition.  This compound name may therefore mean the
remote or distant situation or state, which, with respect to
Stirling, Perth, or Abernethy, ancient seats of government
and power, is very much applicable to the place.  This
etymology, however, is very doubtful.
