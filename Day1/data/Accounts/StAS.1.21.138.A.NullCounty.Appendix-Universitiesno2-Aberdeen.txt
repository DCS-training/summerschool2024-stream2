   Dr George French, professor of chemistry.  And,
   Mr James Kidd, professor of oriental languages.

   Improvements Suggested.-Of the improvements still wanting
to render the course of education more complete in this Uni-
versity, the public will in some measure be enabled to judge
from the foregoing account of it; the following however are
briefly suggested for their consideration.
   The establisment of some new professorships is obviously
necessary for this purpose, particularly one for humanity or
the Latin language, unless such an arrangement could be
adopted, as would enable the present professors of languages
to extend their instructions to the other classes, as well as
those immediately under their care.  This appears the more
necessary, as it is suspected, that the knowledge of Latin is
rather on the decline, over all this part of the united king-
dom; which may be imputed in part, to children being lent
to school, and thence to the University at too early an age,
but chiefly to the present situation of the parochial schools.
Here, the emoluments are so very inadequate to the decent
support of a public teacher, that they are chiefly occupied by
boys at college, or others still worse qualified, and in such
circumstances, no one will chuse to remain longer than he
can find another employment more advantageous.
   In the medical department there are already two professors,
but to established any tolerable school of physic, several others
would be necessary.  A professor of astronomy would also
make an useful addition to the present number, as the vari-
ous subjects taught by the professors of mathematics and na-
tural philosophy, leave them but very little leisure for teach-
ing this agreeable and useful science.  A ready furnished ob-
servatory also affords great encouragement for such an esta-
blishment, where the same person might be fully employed
