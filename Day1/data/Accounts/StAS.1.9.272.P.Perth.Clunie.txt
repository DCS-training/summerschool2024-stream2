ground being ploughed in the spring before the frost was
thoroughly loosened at the bottom of the furrow; a scar-

were obliged in the winter to travel as far as Murrayshire
for meal, which they brought across the mountains with
considerable labour and expense.-The drought of summer
1766 parched the crop here to such a degree, that in the
autumn many of the corn-fields, instead of being cut down

but the mildness of the ensuing winter prevented any hard
consequences.-In August 1769, another water-spout, ac-
companied with dreadful thunder and lightning, fell here
