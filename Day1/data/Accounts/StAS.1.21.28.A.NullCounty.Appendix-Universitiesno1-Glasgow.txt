to grant the University L. 210 sterling yearly, payable out of
the Exchequer: one part of which was appropriated for sala-
ries to a professor of anatomy and botany, and to a professor of
oriental languages; and another part of it for augmenting the
salaries of the principal and professors, according to a scheme
of division mentioned in the deed.  This gift has been renew-
ed by all the subsequent sovereigns.
   The gift of L. 300 per annum, by King WILLIAM, was for
some time directed to be applied for extinguishing the college
debts, and supporting four bursars.  By a subsequent deed of
Queen Anne, in the year 1713, part of it was continued for
the said purposes; and the remainder appropriated for salaries
to a professor of civil law, and a professor of medicine.
   His Majesty King GEORGE I. was pleased to grant, out
of the rents of the archbishopric, a new gift of L. 170 per an-
num; which was appropriated for a salary to a professor of
ecclesiastical history, and for augmenting the smaller salaries of
the other professor.-By these royal donations, the whole of
the rent paid by the College, for the lease of the archbishop-
ric, is exhausted; and regular accompts thereof are transmit-
ted to the Exchequer.
   Since that time there has been one profession added to this
University, by the bounty of King GEORGE II.
   ALEXANDER MACFARLANE, Esq. of Jamaica, had erected
an astronomical observatory in that island, for his own use.
At his death, he bequeathed his astronomical apparatus to the
College of Glasgow, on condition that they should build an
observatory, and appoint an observer.  The College very readi-
ly accepted the condition, and built an observatory; and, in
the year 1760, his Majesty was pleased to grant a presentation
to Dr. ALEXANDER WILSON, to be professor of practical astro-
nomy and observer, with a salary of L. 50 yearly out of the
Exchequer.
