fairs or markets are held here annually; the one early
in June, and the other the first week in December, where
black cattle and other country commodities are fold;
and, though the proprietor exacts no toll or custom, he
maintains a guard while the markets lasts, to keep order, and
prevent riots.  The fair in December is known by the name
of the Goose-market.  But, as no geese are fold at it, the
name Goose-market has probably taken its rise from an en-
tertainment usually given by the gentlemen of the parish to
the principal inhabitants on the second day of the market,
where a goose (being then in season,) always makes a part of
the feast.  On this occasion, there is no excess in drinking
encouraged; and the company meet merely for the sake of
social intercourse.  Adjoining to the village of Drummond
is the parish school, which is commonly attended by 60 or
80 children, and often by a much greater number.  The sa-

and, as precenter and session-clerk, his emoluments will a-
mount to about L. 4, besides the quarter-fees paid by the
scholars, which are as low and moderate as any where in Scot-
land; English being taught for 1 s. per quarter; writing
1 s. 6 d.; arithmetic 2 s.; and Latin 2 s. 6 d.  It is no more
than justice to say that the education of youth is at present
conducted at the school upon the most approved plan, and
with correspondent success.  To which we may add, that,
besides what is usually taught at grammar schools, several o-
ther branches of useful science and literature are taught here,
such as the French language, geography, geometry, book-
keeping, and the different branches of practical mathema-
tics.  This deserves the more to be remarked, because so
few country parishes are favoured with similar advantages
for educating their youth.  Within a quarter of a mile of the
