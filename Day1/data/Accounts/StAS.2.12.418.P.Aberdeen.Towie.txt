   Modern Buildings.-There are no buildings of any note.  The
church, a plain substantial building, was erected in 1803.  The
Masonic Society here built a lodge, in which there is a spacious
hall, in 1821.  It stands almost close to the turnpike road, and
is kept as an inn, which is well frequented.

   Character, Manners, &c. of the People.-The people generally
are industrious, and neat and cleanly in their houses and in their per-
sonal habits, and enjoy a reasonable portion of the comforts and ad-
vantages of society.  Vocal and instrumental music, particularly
the violin, form the most prominent amusements of the people in
The winter evenings, and it is believed that few parishes in Scot-
land can boast of so many good Strathspey players, who are also
temperate in their habits, and industriously employed in their
other avocations.

                         IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-The number of cultivated acres may, be comput-
ed at upwards of 2400. About 100 acres more might be brought
under cultivation; but the doing so would be attended with a heavy
expense, and uncertain profit.  A rotation of seven years is uni-
versally adopted.
   Rent of Land.-The average rent of land may be stated at
18s. per acre.  The duration of leases is usually nineteen years.
The farm-buildings are, with few exceptions, substantial and com-
modious, having for the most part been built by the tenants, with
an allowance at the expiry of lease seldom exceeding a year's rent;
a sum in most cases not equal to one-third of the cost of erection.
The native limestone has never been generally used; and on ac-
count of its inferior quality, and the difficulty of obtaining fuel,
it is now almost entirely abandoned and is obtained from Cor-
