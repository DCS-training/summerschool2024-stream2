   Farmers.-Some of our farmers have been favoured with a
liberal education.  A few of them have been instructed in
the rudiments of the Latin language.  Almost all of them
have been taught writing and arithmetic, as well as to read
the English language with understanding and ease.  Most of
them from their earliest years are inured to manual labour.
Nor are the operations of carting, plowing, etc. confined to
their earlier years; many of them always, and most of them
occasionally, lend their personal labour to the cultivation of
their grounds.
   As our farmers in general do not enjoy the luxuries of af-
fluence, so few of them are subjected to the miseries of ex-
treme poverty.  Their diet is usually frugal; but occasions
are not wanting when they enjoy with temperance the com-
forts of the table.  Their mental qualifications are not infe-
rior to their external advantages.  This valuable order of so-
ciety, is in this place distinguished by no inconsiderable de-
gree of manly intelligence and general information.
   A careful and candid observer will not deny, that our
farmers are in general frugal, industrious, and moderately
happy; at the same time he must acknowledge, that their
circumstances might, in many respects, be considerably
improved.  It is not altogether without reason, that they
complain of the small extent and of the high rents of
their farms.  Their dwelling houses, with a few excep-
tions, are confessedly incommodious.  Though the vestiges
of their original slavery be gradually wearing away, they are
not as yet completely effected.  In some baronies, the far-
mers work the hay, and in others, they cart the coals of the
landholders.  Thirlage is an obvious grievance.  Thirlage is
a low kind of monopoly by which the tenant is obliged to
make all, or some part of his meal, at one specified mill.
The consequences of thirlage are similar to the consequences
