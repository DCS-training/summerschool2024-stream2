   Amusements.--Curling, in its season, is eagerly pursued, and the
confidence of the Denny players, in their superior skill and tact,
prompts a challenge every season to their neighbours. A year
or two ago, a Denny Curling Club was formed. John Carnie,
Esq. of Curling Hall, Largs, so well known to the curling world

Mr Niel Carnie, who was a principal partner in the firm of Messrs
Thomas Shiels and Co. of Herbertsbire Printfield. On the
Carron, and the reservoirs of the printfield, his son, John, first

there is a little frost, may, by a slight suffusion of water over
its surface, present in four hours, (the thermometer at 28&deg;,) the
finest and firmest ice a curler could desire.
   A Denny Archers' Club was instituted in 1828, for the pur-

--and for a silver arrow, at the same distance,--the successful
competitors becoming vice-presidents. The medal and arrows
remain in the possession successful competitor; the others
are shot for annually. Members are admitted by ballot,--one
