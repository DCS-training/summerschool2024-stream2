perhaps a small croft to cottagers, or cottars, as they are call-
ed.  Some of these are handy-craftsmen, who subsist by their
trade; others are common labourers, who hire themselves
out for day's wages in the country.  The number of trades-
men is as follows: 10 square wrights: 4 wheel wrights; 5
smiths; 4 shoemakers; 14 shop-keepers; 14 taylors; 40
weavers, including apprentices.  Some of these have other
occupations besides their trade.

   Wages.-The wages are regulated according to the na-
ture of the work, and the time of the year in which it is per-
formed.  A day-labourer, from the beginning of March till
harvest, gets 8 d. per day, besides victuals; a hay or corn-cut-
ter 1 s.; a taylor 6 d.; a lint-dresser 8 d.; a wright 1 s.  Wo-
men hired for spinning, get 2 d. or 3 d., according to their
merit.  Men servants, engaged for a year, get about 6 L.;
and women from 2 L. 10 s. to 3 L. Sterling.

   Live Stock.-Most of the tenants depend on the sale of cat-
tle, for the payment of their rents.  The number of sheep
is about 9000.  More than a third of these are of the black
and white faced kind, somewhat large in the body, and
rough in the wool.  The rest are of the common Scotch kind,
smaller in size than the former, but very hardy.  A few of
the Cheviot breed have lately been introduced.  The black
cattle are of the small Highland kind.  They feed remarka-
bly well, and, when properly fed on grass, they prove excel-
lent beef.  Few of them, when fed, exceed in weight 20
stones of beef.  Their number is about 2000.  Few horses
are kept, except what are barely sufficient for cultivating the
ground.  They are computed at about 800.  There are also
some parcels of swine, and a few goats.
