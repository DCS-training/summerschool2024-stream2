of Scotland, where the air is milder or more wholesome than
in the village of Colmonell, and all along the banks of the Stin-
chiar.-The weary and impatient traveller, chilled and
benumbed with the pinching cold he has experienced on the
adjacent mountains, feels with peculiar pleasure, the genial
warmth of the valley into which he descends.-The inhabi-
tants, in general, are not only long lived, but healty in their
old age.  There are a good number upwards of 80, now alive;
among whom, there is a woman in the 93 year of her age, who

   Rivers.-Stinchiar is the principal river in the parish.  It
has its source in the parish of Barr, about twelve miles above
the village of Colmonell.  Its water is most clear and transpa-
rent, so that a fifth lying at six or eight feet deep in it, can be
distinctly seen from its banks.  It produces salmon and trout;

of the inhabitants.  Several streams or rivulets, fall into the
Stichiar, particularly the Asshill, the Dusk, the Muick,
and the Feoch.

   Woods.-It is universally believed, from traditional authori-

Knockdolian hill, to the kirk of Barr, an extent of ten miles:
and it may be stated, as an additional proof in support of that
idea, that, in mossy grounds, large oak trees are often found in
that part of the country.  There is also still a great deal of wood
in the neighbourhood.  The banks of the Stinchiar are adorned
with natural woods, almost the whole length of its passage thro'
the parish.  There is also much wood upon the Muick; and for an
extent of three miles at least, upon the Dusk.  The timber grow-
ing in these woods, is oak, ash, elm, birch; and there are also
