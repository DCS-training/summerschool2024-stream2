brought from Cumberland to the parts of Palnackie and Tongland
Bridge. At certain seasons, when their servants and horses are
not necessarily engaged in agricultural operations, the farmers send
for coal to Dalmellington, in Ayrshire, a distance of thirty-six
miles from Castle Douglas. Here it costs less than the same
weight of English coal; but it is also much less durable; and,
taking into account the long land carriage, in reality no cheaper.
The common cart-load of shipped coal, containing 8 bushels, or
12 ewt., costs about 9s., besides cartage, which is 2s. 6d. more.
Peat is found in the parish, but it is not very extensively used as
fuel.
