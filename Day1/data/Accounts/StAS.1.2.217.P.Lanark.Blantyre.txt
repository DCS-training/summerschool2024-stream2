doubled, in the course of about 4 years, and may now amount
to 1040 souls.  In the mill there are, at present, 4096 spindles
driven by water; and the company are still greatly extending
their operations.  There is another very large house built contigu-
ous to the mill, which is to contain 15000 spindles, to be dri-
ven by the hand : but only a very small part of these machines
are as yet finished.  A considerable village is now built, for the
accommodation of the people employed at this work, where
formerly there was not a single house.
   The employment at cotton mills, has, in general, been ac-
counted unfavourable to health; and yet, what is singular, in
the present case, is, that out of a great number, employed
at work within the mill, only two have died since it was erected.
Great care indeed is taken, to keep both the house and machi-
nery as clean as possible; fresh air is carefully thrown in; and
tar is burnt, to remove or counteract the noxious smell of the
oil, that must necessarily be used about the machines.

   Heritors.-There are at present 37 heritors, who pay cess;
and of these, 10 do not reside in the parish.  The landed pro-
perty has very seldom been transferred : for, though there are
few possessed of more than a plowgate of land, and some who
have only a few acres, yet many even of these small possessions,
have been inherited by the same family, for some hundred
years.  This retention of landed property, is plainly to be
imputed to the industry, frugality, and amiable rural simpli-
city of the inhabitants.  The whole parish consists of 24
plowgates of land, each plowgate containing about 80 acres;
and, for the most part, the proprietor occupies his own
lands.

   Produce.-The parish consists, for the most part, of arable
grounds; and oats are the crops most frequently raised.  Pease,
