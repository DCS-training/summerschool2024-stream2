			PARISH OF FETTERESSO.

		PRESBYTERY OF FORDOUN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

                    THE REV. GEORGE THOMSON, MINISTER.

                 I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.--IN ancient records, the name is variously written Foder-
esach, Fethiresach, Fetheressow, &c. An eminent Celtic scholar
states, that Fiathair, (Fiatha and ar) signifies lay land, or wild
and uncultivated land; Feathar (Fea and ar), bogqy land. Es-
sach, a waterfall, cataract, cascade:--so that Featber-esso seems to
signify the uncultivated, or marshy, or boggy land, in the vicinity of
the waterfall. There is a beautiful waterfall on a small scale, near
the burying-ground; but none of any considerable extent in the
parish.
   Situation, Extent, and Boundaries.--The parish is about 10
miles in length, between 5 and 6 in breadth, and comprehends
24,914 acres. It is bounded on the south by the parish of Dun-
nottar; on the west, by Glenbervie, Durris, and Maryculter; on
the north, by Maryculter, and Banchory Devenick; and on the
east, by the German Ocean. Its southern extremity is 115 miles
north of Edinburgh, and 15 south of Aberdeen.
   Topographical Appearance.--Its surface is, irregular, but not
mountainous,--presenting a landscape, varying from the most
pleasing to the most bleak. The new town of Stonehaven, the
banks of the Carron and Cowie through the whole of their course,
the grounds adjoining Fetteresso Castle, Ury, Rickarton, and
Netherley, may be considered age belonging to the former. Nor
is there wonting at Elsick, Muchalls, and Cowie, and in the bold
rocky coast, much that is also pleasing to the eye. Most of the
other districts, particularly the great common of Cowie, in the
centre of the parish, are bleak, even where cultivation is carried on
upon a regular and approved system. But there is, in some districts
great want of wood and, enclosures, and, of course, of shelter;
and much mossy, wet, and bleak land.
