serving attention is the enlargement of Saltcoats Harbour.
Though, the first building of it, 90 years ago, was a great ef-
fort for a private gentlemen, it does not now suit the im-
proved state of the trade and shipping.  It consists of a quay,
all of stone, about 24 feet thick, large hewn stones on each
side, and an outer wall to shelter the ships, of a considerable
height.  This building runs along a natural ridge of rocks,
in a straight line from N. E. to S. W. five hundred feet.
At the S. W. end, it turns at a right angle, and runs through
the sea, more than a hundred anti sixty feet, forming a pier
which points nearly north.  Within this rectangular space is
the present harbour, capable of containing 24 vessels, having
a proper clay bottom, dry at low water, and from 10 to 12
feet deep at spring tides, admitting vessels of 200 tons.  But,
as only two large, and three smaller vessels can be loaded at
a time, and the large ones must be hauled down to the very
end or point of the pier, before they can complete their load-
ing, and must sail too, at a spring-tide, in order to make
room for the loading of the rest.  This delay is a very great
inconvenience in the coal trade.

   To remove which, it is proposed to carry forward the first
described line of quay two hundred and fifty feet beyond the
pier, onwards to the S. W. along the same line of natural
rocks, which still continues.  Then, to turn it through the
sea, northward and eastward with a single obtuse angle, till
it conies so near the point of the pier as to leave room for
ships to enter.  This would form an outer harbour capable of
containing 14 vessels more, in water from 15 to 16 feet, and
much more commodious than the present one.  For the
present pier (stripped of its outer wall) would strand as a
tongue or middle quay between them, from which vessels
could take in their loading on each side; the largest always
