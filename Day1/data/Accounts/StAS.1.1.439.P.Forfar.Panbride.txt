   Poor.-The number of poor varies from 8 to 10:  They
are all maintained in their own houses; and there is not a
beggar in the parish.  But, besides the ordinary poor, there
is a considerable number of householders in indigent circum-
stances, each of whom get a boll of coals from the session
yearly.  The funds bearing interest do not much exceed
L. 100; but a considerable sum arises from the mortcloth
and hearse fees.  The weekly collections in chuch are from
5 s. to 7 s. or 8 s.

   Stipend.-The stipend is 1/2 chalder of wheat, 3 chalders
of oatmeal, 2 chalders of barley, and L. 30: 5: 6 Sterling;
in which sum is included L. 5 for communion elements.  The
glebe consists of 4 acres, 1 rood, and some falls, of very good
land.  The King is patron.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is one mineral spring of
the chalybeate kind, but it is not much frequented.  There
is plenty of sea-weed along the coast for manuring land; but
it has rarely been made into kelp.  Haddocks, cod, etc. were
