try, have contributed to their prosperity; as it is a certain
fact that at the present period they are better lodged, better
cloathed, and have the necessaries of life in much greater
abundance, than when their rents were trifling: yet the
general spirit of improvement in agriculture, which now per-
vades Scotland, has not made so rapid a progress as might
have been expected in Annandale.  The purchase of the Isle
of Man, however, and the stop put by that means to smug-
gling, in which all the people living upon the Solway Frith
were more or less concerned, have wrought a surprising
change on their industry, as well as improved their morals.
Although French brandy has, in consequence of these alte-
rations almost wholly disappeared, its place is now occupi-
ed by whisky, a spirit equally fatal to the health of the people,
though not so hurtful to the revenue.  This accursed beve-
rage is retailed in numbers of tippling houses, and coming so
low as 1 s. 6 d. the Scotch pint, is greedily swallowed by the
people, though it saps their constitutions, and ruins their
health.  When the proposed wise measures of allowing coals
to be imported duty free, and laying an additional tax upon
Scotch spirits, are adopted by government, it is to be hoped
that the more wholesome liquor brewed from good malt will
again be drunk by the people, and their attachment to whis-
ky weakened, if not destroyed.
