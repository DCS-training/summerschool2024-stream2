   Agriculture.-The green hills afford good sheep-pasture,
and in several places might yield excellent green crops of
potatoes, turnip, &c. if properly cultivated for this pur-
pose.  There crops begin now to be more generally raised
than formerly, and the farmers to be better reconciled to
them, though some of the lower classes and more ignorant
are still averse to these valuable improvements, being wed-
ded to their old absurd and, unskilful practices.  But the
frequent failures and losses that attend new schemes at-
tempted by more speculative and opulent farmers, to them
appear sufficient reason for not too rashly changing the
plans and practices of their forefathers, and giving up, a
sure, though moderate profit, for the uncertain hopes of un-
experienced theorists.  The culture of field-turnip and
cabbage is but lately introduced here; and the Earl of
Morton, who of 63 ploughgates in the parish possesses 28,
seems at present very anxious to promote and encourage
this plan of agriculture among his tenants.  The rent of
land, exclusive of the poorest outfield, is from 10 s. to
L. 2 an acre.  The English plough, with 2 horses, is most
generally used, though some farmers still prefer the old
Scotch plough, with 4 horses and a driver.  Of late the
rent of land is greatly increased.  Farms that about 20
years ago let at 10 s. an acre, are now more than 20; and
those which even 6 years ago paid L. 20 of rent, now let
at L. 30.  But the plan of husbandry is much better now
than formerly, and the land hence greatly improved in va-
lue.  The real rent of the parish within these few years, has
consequently been raised several hundred pounds.  It can-
not at present, for particular reasons, be exactly ascertain-
ed.  The rotation of crops is variable according to the va-
