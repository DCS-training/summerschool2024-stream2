weavers are still, and have long been in the practice of 
purchasing flax, which they spin, weave and bleach, each 
for his own account:  The quantity of cloth thus manufac-
tured is inconsiderable, but it finds a ready market in our 
country-fairs, and generally sells at the rate of I d. Sterling
a-yard, above the current price of cloth of the same 
quality, whitened at a regular bleachfield.  The bleaching
of cloth was a considerable trade five or six years ago, and
is still continued, though not to half the extent.  About 
15 years ago, a manufacture of coloured threads was esta-
blished in Bervie, and is still carried on.  The threads are 
sent to the London market, where they generally finds a 
ready sale.  This manufacture employs, in all its parts,
about 50 people.  Three years ago, a machine was erected
on the haughs of Bervie, for spinning linen-yarn :  This 
machine was the first of the kind in Scotland.  Although 
exceedingly imperfect at first, it is now brought to a con-
siderable degree of improvements; the yarn it spins is of 
a good quality, and fit for any sort of manufacture what-
ever.  The proprietors of this machine have also the thread-
manufacture, mentioned above, so that all the yarn spun
by the mchine is made into threads.  The house is not 
yet filled with machinery, but will contain from 600 to
700 spindles, when full, and employ about 60 boys
and girls, and 20 to 30 men and women.  Two years ago
a sail-cloth manufacture was established, which employs 14
weavers, and a proportional number of other hands.  A
lint-mill was built last year on the haughs of Bervie,
which is likely to meet with encouragement.  There are 
also two mills for cutting barley, and they cut about 1300
bolls yearly, which is generally carried up the frith of 
Forth.  There is likewise a corn-mill, to which the te-
nants of the parish are thirled.  In last December, a dif-
