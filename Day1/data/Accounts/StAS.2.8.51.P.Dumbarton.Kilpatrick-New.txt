number of births is still less to be relied on for very few of the
Dissenters are at the pains to register. We can therefore obtain
only an approximation from the proportion of Dissenters to. the
adherents of the Established Church; the latter being required
to register before obtaining baptism for their-children. This pro-
portion gives 89.3 as the yearly average of births for the last three
years. We have no public register of deaths; but a rivate list
kept by the grave-digger gives 71, as the average number of
burials during the same period. This, however, is considerably
above the average of deaths within the parish ; for, owing to the
neighbourhood of Glasgow and other circumstances, more funerals
come from other parishes than leave this. For instance, of the
97 burials in 1834, 22  * were from other parishes, while only four
persons are known to have been carried elsewhere for burial. The
average of these years is likewise increased by there having been
8 burials in consequence of cholera in 1832, and 6 in 1834.
Making allowance for these circumstances, the yearly average of
deaths will be found to be about 60, or in the proportion of one to
52.8 inhabitants. +
