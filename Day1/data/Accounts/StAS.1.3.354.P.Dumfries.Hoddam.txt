Ecclessechan, for London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.  The
revenue, arising from the postage levied upon letters and pac-
kets, at the post-office in Ecclessechan, amounts to 120 L. per

this village a market is held every month, besides two
fairs in the year.  These fairs and markets, besides con-

swine was advertised to bed held every Friday, from the begin-

in January 1788, and has since continued according to the
original establishment.  During these 4 years, upwards of
