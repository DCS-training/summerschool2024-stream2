   There are 169 families, 5 1/2 to each family. Those of 10
years and under, are to those above that age as 2 to 9.
There are 1 Roman Catholic; 7 Episcopalians; 33 Seceders.
The population from 1716 to 1770 is calculated from bap-
tisms, and burials being multiplied by 26 and 36, and the
half of the whole product being taken for the number of
souls required, that of 1780 and 1789 is ascertained by actual
enumeration.  It should thus appear, that the population of
the parish during the present century has been very much
the same:  Many causes may have contributed to this; the
number of large farms, of small possessions, and of cottages
continued nearly equal; and, though our increased wealth
should have produced more children, yet having no trading
village to keep them at home, those who were not
needed for the usual domestic purpose, may have gone in
search of employment to the many manufacturing towns,
with which we are surrounded.  From the cottages being
in more easy circumstances than formerly, it is probable
there may now be greater proportion of souls under 12
