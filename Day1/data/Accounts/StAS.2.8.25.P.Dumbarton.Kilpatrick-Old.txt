parish, are mostly of the Highland breed, and are bought at the
large fairs or trysts in the country round.
   The milch cows, of which. there are a great number, are of the
Ayrshire breed. Little cheese is made as the farmers find it more
profitable to supply the villages of the parish, or the neighbouring
towns, with milk and butter. Part of the milch cows are reared
in the parish, but a great many are brought from neighbouring pa-
rishes. Some of the farmers have been remarkably successful in
bringing their stock to the greatest perfection, both as regards the
symmetry of the form of the animal, and the quantity and the qua-
lity of the produce. The butter of one of the dairy farms is so
well known in the Glasgow market for its excellent quality, that
it brings regularly ten per cent. more than the ordinary price.
   The sheep which are reared and fed in the moor parts of the
parish, are nearly all of the black-faced kind.
   The leases of land are in general for nineteen years.
   The Average gross amount of Raw Produce.--This cannot be
stated very accurately, as a number of farms have, been unlet, and
have been under a course of improvement by their proprietors.
Some of the lands have been thrown into pasture which were cul-
tivated before, and may soon come to be cultivated again. Some
others have not been under a regular rotation of crops. But the
following statement may be considered an approximation:

   Quarries and Mines.--Besides the mines of coal and limestone,
mentioned under the head of Mineralogy, there is abundance of
freestone and whinstone, quarries of both of which are wrought
in different parts of the parish.
   Fisheries.--There are two fishing stations on the Clyde, but
these are not of much value,--the one never renting more than
L. 2 or L. 3 a-year the other never more than L. 6 or L. 8.
   Manufactures.--The factories, of William Dunn, Esq. for spin-
ning and weaving cotton.--These consist of four large mills: the
Faifley mill, the Duntocher mill, the Milton mill, and the Hard-
gate mill, all situated within less than a mile of each other. It
was about the year 1808, that these works were commenced.
