and 3 miles above Berwick.  from the Tweed, which a-
bounds in  fine salmon, a great many of these fish get into
the Whitadder, and in the months of September and Oc-
tober are found 30 miles up that river, passing into the small
brooks among the hills in Lammermooor, till their backs
are not covered, and there lodge their spawn among the 
gravel.  No part of the Whitadder is rented, and the fishes
are killed with the rod or lister.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, about
40 years ago, the number were 2593.  Within these 60
years last past, the number of inhabitants in the town of 
Dunse has been doubled; and though the town has not in
that time extended itself much to any of its wings, yet ma-
ny empty spaces have been built upon, and many old houses,
which contained only 1 or 2 families, have been rebuilt up-
on larger plans, and now contain from 4 to 8, and some of 
them 10 families.  There are scarce any vestiges of old
houses.  Many new ones have been built of late years, and 
several are now building.  By a very exact list, taken 3
years ago, the number of souls in the town was 2324; in
the country part of the parish, 1000.  In all, 3324.
