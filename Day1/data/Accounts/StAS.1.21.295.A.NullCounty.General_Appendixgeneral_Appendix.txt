Firth; and, in time of war, could rendezvous at Inverness or
Fortwilliam, protected by strong forts, and in harbours that
may justly be reckoned among the safest and most capacious
in the kingdom.  Besides, a frigate or two, stationed in the
Moray Firth between Peterhead and Fort George, together
with as many on the west coast, between the found of Mull
and the north of Ireland, could afford greater protection to
our trade in those quarters, than many times the number at
present, when the navigation round the north of Scotland is
so scattered.

affluence; and several, who, contrary to their inclination,
are obliged to leave their native soil, and remove to other
states, might contribute to the strength and wealth of their
own country.  Large tracts of land, now in a barren state,
might be improved; and those parts, which at present af-
ford but a scanty subsistence to a small number of inhabi-
tants, might be so far meliorated, as, with the help of com-

   That the above assertions may not appear too bold or ex-

at present is entirely confined to one side of the kingdom,
would, by means of this canal, become open to both; so that
twice the number of hands might be employed in that
branch: and the cod and ling fishing, which is yet but in its
infancy, might be carried on as extensively as the herring
fishing.  In all the attempts hitherto mad, in the white fish-
