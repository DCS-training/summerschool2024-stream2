and cuckoos; of the smaller birds such as are common through
Scotland.  We have also water fowls of variuos kinds.  There
is one kind of duck, of the migratory tribe, called the widgeon.
They abound much in our bays.  They appear about the be-
ginning of winter, and migrate about the end of spring.  If
the end of autumn is severe and stormy, they appear some-
times before winter.

   Rents and Heritors.-The valued rent, as stated in 1751,
was 389 L. 10 s. 4 d.:  the real rent may be at present about
3280 L.  There are 13 heritors, great and small, in the parish;
of whom only 4 reside.  Services are in a good measure abo-

   Ecclesiastical State.-The church of Kilmore was built
about 300 years ago.  It was originally in the form of a ca-

pacy in Scotland; but, on the introduction of Presbytery, as
the old building became decayed, a part of it was repaired;
and reduced to the size of an ordinary large kirk; about 60
feet long, and 20 broad.-The kirk of Kilbride is of a lesser
size, 40 feet in length, and 16 in breadth.  The walls of Kil-
more church are very sufficient:  The roof and windows have
received repairs at different times.  It is poorly seated; but
there is reason to think, that the heritors will soon make up
this defect.  The kirk of Kilbride is not so sufficient in the
walls, as that of Kilmore; and the seats are equally bad.  It
stands greatly in need of repairs.  Neither of them have
church-yards; but it is proposed to have them soon.  Indeed, a
few excepted, the kirks in the West Highlands are in a miser-
able condition, compared with those in many other country
parishes in Scotland.  But, as improvements of all kinds are
every where going on rapidly, we hope the churches, in this
