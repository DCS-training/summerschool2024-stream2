  Hydrography.--There is a remarkable sulphuretted spring, dis-
covered in 1831, close to the shore at Bogany point, and about a
mile east from Rothesay. It is much visited by invalids, and many
have derived great benefit from the use of its waters. The folow-
ing analysis and note are by Dr Thomas Thomson, Professor of
Chemistry in the University of Glasgow:--
	"In an imperial gallon, or 277, 274 cubic inches, there are com-
mon salt, 186.73 grains; sulphate of lime, 125.20; sulphate of
soda, 129.77; chloride of magnesium, 32.80; silica, 14.39.
	"The sulphuretted hydrogen gas in the imperial gallon was 17.4
cubic inches. Thd great use of this kind of water is in deseases
of the skin. When taken internally, or used in a bath, it is the
most valuable madicine in existence such diseases. It is also
useful in glandular diseases in general." We may add, that it has
been found exceedingly beneficial in many cases of rheumatism.
	The number of lochs in the parish is five, besides two which
divide it from Kingarth on the south.

        Geology and Mineralogy.--That part of the parish which lies
south of the bay of Rothesay and of Lochfad is entirely composed
of conglomerate and red sandstone;  while all to the north of
these consists ot mica-slate, clay-slate, chlorite-slate, traversed by
trap and quartz veins. +
	The soil is in general shallow on the more elevated ground. In
some parts, it is light, in others of stiff retentive clay, in others
mossy. The finest soil, which is alluvial, is in the valley which
stretches from Kames to Ettrick bay. It is loamy, and in some
places mixed with moss, yielding most abundant crops of wheat
oats, barley, turnips, potatoes, &c. On the west shore at St Ninians,
bay, there is a bed of marl of considerable depth and value. There
are no mines of importance, if we except the greenstone quarry in
the immediate vicinity of Rothesay, out of which most of the houses.

<FOOTNOTE>The cotton mill-dam which is connected with Lochfad covers, when full, 67
acres additional.
