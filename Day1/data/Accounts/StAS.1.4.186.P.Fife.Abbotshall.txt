but thin and cold on the north skirts.  The extent of sea-
coast is about half a mile, lying along the west side of the
Bay of Kerkaldy.  It is very flat and sandy, but exceedd-
ingly pleasant; most of the towns and villages on the coast
are pleasantly situatedd.-The lands of Abbot's Hall, which
belong to Mr Ferguson of Raith, abound in coal of diffe-
rent seams, it is said,some 3, 5, and even 14 feet.  Part
of the crop-coal only was wrought about 40 years ago.

   Population.-The ancient extent of the population is not
easily traced, but was much less than at present.  The re-
turn to Dr Webster's, about 40 years ago, was only 1348
souls.  In 1791, the total population is 2136; males 1061,
females 1075.  The number of inhabitants in the town is
1660, in the country 476.  The annual average of births
is 50, of deaths 44, of marriages 22.  Under 10 years of
age there are 249 males, 239 females; only a few persons
are between 80 and 90.  There are 6 heritors, 2 of whom
reside.  Farmers 25, their families about 200; 8 principal
manufacturers, besides a few smaller ones; apprentices 50;
seamen about 10 or 12; male household-servants 63; fe-

are tradesmen, being wholly employed in manufacturers.
Families of gentry 3; 1 in the town and 2 in the country.
One minister of the Established Church, and a person who
preaches to a small Cameronian meeting.  The number of
the Established Church 1338, of Seceders 798.  Within
these 20 yeas, the population of the town is increased be-

decreased above 100.  The increase of the former is owing
