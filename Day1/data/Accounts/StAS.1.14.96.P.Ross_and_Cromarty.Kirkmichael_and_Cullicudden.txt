   Miscellaneous Observations.-In searching for lime-
stone, in 1786, several specks of rich lead ore were
found in a free-stone rock, to the S. of the mill of St.
Martin's, by the late Mr. Gordon of Newhall, whose
classical knowledge, philanthropy, and engaging man-
ners endeared him to all who knew him: Appearances
were so favourable, that workmen had proceeded a good
way in cutting through the rock, under ground, in 2
different directions, in hopes of meeting a vein of ore;
when his sudden and much lamented death, in January
1778, put an end to the attempt.  Some spar, lime-
stone, and stone-marl were found in digging through the
above rock, in which a number of specks of ore were
found embedded.  Rich shell-marl was discovered, a few
years ago, in a small loch near the mansion-house of
Baclangwell, which the proprietor has used, as a ma-
nure to his fields, with great success.-Salmon, trout,
skate, herrings, whitings, small cod, flounders of various
kinds, cuttle-fish, needle-fish, cuddies, and a variety of
smaller fry, are caught in the frith opposite to this pa-
rish, by hooks and nets, and also by yares (belonging to
Newhall and Poynterfield), in which cart-loads of her-
rings and other kinds of fish are sometimes found en-
closed, after the tide leaves them.-About 10 tons of
kelp are made, every third year, on the shores of New-

worth at their death, (after paying funeral charges), to the poor of the
parish, if they did not leave an indigent parent or child.  In consequence
of this regulation, the number of poor receiving aid from the session, is
now reduced to 35.  Besides the weekly collections, the greatest part of
which is given by the residing heritors, the incumbent has been at pains,
for several years past, to make up a small permanent accumulating fund,
the interest of which, he hopes, will, in a few years, afford considerable re-
lief to the greatest objects.  It has already increased to 30 L. Sterling.
