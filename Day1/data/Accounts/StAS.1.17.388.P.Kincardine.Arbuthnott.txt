   Produce.-The produce of the parish is more than suf-

are oats and bear, with a little barley and wheat.  Turnip
and potatoes are likewise very general.  A considerable quan-
tity of clover and rye-grass now begins to be sown, though not

for the last fourteen years, the tenants are bound to a mode
of cropping the improved ground; to divide it into a course
of four, five, or six crops, with a restriction not to take more
crops of grain than the rotation of six admitted, viz. turnip,
barleys, and grass, not less than two years, to be broken up
with two successive crops of grain of different kinds each
year; and if any of these be wheat, it must be the first after
grass.  As might be expected, the tenants have chosen to
hold the course of six, preferably to the four or five years.
