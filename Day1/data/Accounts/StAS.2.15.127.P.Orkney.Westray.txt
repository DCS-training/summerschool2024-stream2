from the period when that race of people were the possessors of
the country. Similar to the ancient graves here scattered over
the sandy plains, they are naturally a subject of curiosity. But I
have never heard of, any of them having been opened, but one
which was opened at the request of two strangers, who visited the
island many years ago. An urn, with one or two domestic utensils,
-a drinking cup and quern, were discovered.

<TABLE=POPULATION>

                              III.-POPULATION.

       In 1755 the population of this parish, according to Dr Webster, sets, 1290
          1793, according to the last Statisti6al Account,                   1629
          1811,                                                              1626
          1821,                                                              1947
          1831, the number of males was 940, of females 1092, in all,        2032

     The decrease of population between 1793 and 1811 was owing
to the number of young men impressed, or that volunteered into
the service of the navy, during the late French revolutionary
war.
     There are only two families of independent fortunes residing
in this parish, namely, Mr Traill of Holland, and Mr Stewart of
Brugh.
     The number of landed proprietors of the yearly value of L.50, is         8
                     widows upwards of 50 years,                             12
                     unmarried men upwards of 50,                            43
                     unmarried women upwards of 45,                          44
                     families in tbe parish,                                  4
       Average number of children in each family,                             3
       The number of inhabited houses in the parish,                        273
                     uninhabited houses,                                      4

     The number of insane persons, 5; of dumb, 2; of deaf, 4; of
blind, 3; and of fatuous description, 3.
     One custom in this parish, and common to Orkney at large,
is that of allowing the servants four or five days liberty at Christ-
mas, to enjoy themselves. Only the most necessary part of domes-
tic work, with due attention to the bestial on the farm, is done on
these days. The master of the house has, also, to keep up a well-
furnished table for all his servants at that season.
     Another practice peculiar to this place is, that of observing punc-
tually those days in the Roman calendar, on which eating and
drinking are practised with more liberality than usual.
     Enjoying in a moderate degree the necessary comforts of life,
the people appear, in general, contented with their situation and
circumstances; and the little emigration that takes place may be
deemed a proof of this. They are naturally shrewd, and many of
them of quick parts; and in general, they are very desirous of
knowledge.
