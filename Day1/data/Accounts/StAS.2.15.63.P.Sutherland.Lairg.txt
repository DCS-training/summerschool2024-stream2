	not only want pasture, but their rents far exceed the value of the
	land; and the appearance of their houses tells but too plainly the
	condition of their inhabitants. The population of the parish is
	now rapidly decreasing, as may be seen from the following state-
	ment:-

	   Language, Character, &c. of the People-The language gene-
	rally spoken is the Gaelic; and, although all the young people
	now speak English, the Gaelic can hardly be said to have lost
	ground, and the people, from being taught to read it, speak it more
	correctly than they did some years ago.
	   The inhabitants of the parish are an interesting people;-they
	are cleanly in their habits, and neat in their dress; they combine
	intelligence with modesty, and due respect for their superiors; they
	are sober, moral, and industrious; and they show a becoming re-
      gard for the ordinances of religion.

                                IV.-INDUSTRY.
	    Agriculture and Rural Economy.-From the description already
	given of the parish, as consisting principally of moor ground, it
	will be seen that very little can be said under the head of agricul-
	ture. There is no great corn farm in the parish; and, with the
	exception of the lots occupied by the tenants; (which all lie within
	two and a-half miles of the church,) the whole of it has been turn-
	ed into sheep-walks. The breed of sheep on these farms is the
	Cheviot, and that, too, we believe, of a superior kind,-as much
	attention has been paid to its improvement in all parts of the county.
	The average rent of grazing on the sheep farms does not exceed
	2s. a-head; but what number of sheep there are on these farms, the
	writer has no means of discovering. The lotters, on the Duchess
	of Sutherland's property raise, in favourable seasons, as much corn
	as supplies their families during the year; and of late, a very de-
	cided improvement has been manifested in the mode of cultivating
      their land.

                                V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	   Means of Communication.-There is no market-town in the pa-
	rish, nor any nearer than Dornoch, which is distant from Lairg
