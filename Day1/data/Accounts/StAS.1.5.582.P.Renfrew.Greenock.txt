     Statistical Account

10 feet perpendicular, meeting several rivulets, the slaught-
er-house should send, chiefly by means of pumped water,
all its blood ans filth through the greatest breadth of the
town.  This shocking nuisance the Magistrates and prici-
pal people of Greenock have repeatedly attempted to re-
move; but all their endeavours have been hitherto
thwarted.-The mention of one nuisance introduces ano-

pointed-the rest may be easily imagined*.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-About 15 years ago there
was only onr stage-coach from Greenock to Glasgow; now
there are, every lawful day, four; with one to Irvine, and
in winter one between Greenock and Port Glasgow; be-
sides post-chaises, of which there are in the place, eight.-On
the quays of Greenock, as hold-fasts for the ships, and in o-
ther parts of the town, may be seen a number of iron guns,
of different sizes, which were many years ago recovered
by a London diver, from the wreck of one of the ships of
the unfortunate Spanish Armada, which sunk off the old
