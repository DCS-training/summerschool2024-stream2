     of Sandwick and Stromness.

   Kelp.-As the west coast of there parishes is high and
rocky, the quantity of kelp made is not considerable.  The
sea-weed on the shores is cut and burnt only once in two
or three years.  No kelp is made from the sea ware that
is driven ashore from the ocean.  About 150 tons may be
made once in three years; that is, at an average, 50 tons
yearly; of which about 8 tons are made in the parish of
Sandwick, and about 42 tons yearly in the parish of Strom-
ness.

   Fisheries.-The fish caught here are cod, ling, skate,
holybut, haddocks, lobsters, etc.  Cod and ling are caught
about a league's distance from the west coast of these pa-
rishes.  Three boats only are employed in this fishing in
the parish of Sandwick, and as many in the parish of
Stromness.  The outfit and expence on this fishing, and
the returns in good seasons, are as follow:
