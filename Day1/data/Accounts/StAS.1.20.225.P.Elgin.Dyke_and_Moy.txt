till night, in digging the foundations in a different quarter.
Before morning, he had secured the contents of an earthen
pot, of old coins, which, at convenience, were sold as bul-
lion, for about L.46.  They were all of one size, broader than
a sixpence, and very thin; but the silver was fine and unsul-
lied.  Such as had been unavoidably scattered, were found,
by the test of Anderson's Numesmata, to be groat pieces;
with a rude impression of a head, hand, and sceptre, upon
each.  They had been struck, at many different places, both
in Scotland and England, as appeared by the one side; on
the other side, they bore the impression and name of one or
other of these contemporary princes, Henry II. of England,
or King William of Scotland.  Some, that had been struck
at Striveling, had the words RE VILLAM ; Re being the Gae-
lic word for King.  I saw some of both kinds.

   Records.-The oldest parish record now extant, goes back
as far as 1610.  It is very ill to read.  In some periods, the
records seem very exactly kept; in others, they are very
much deranged and confused.  No record of burials has ever
been regularly kept; as there are two burial grounds, and
two grave-diggers, it is the more difficult to be exact.  At
present, there are three records carried on at once.  A re-
gister of baptisms and marriages; a cash-book; and a book
of discipline, for recording the proceedings of the church ses-
sion.  This has frequent references to the cash-book, and 
the cash-book to it.  All of these new records commenced
in 1788.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In the last century, James
Brodie of that Ilk, and his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Dun-
bar of Grangehill, ahd each of them 9 marriageable daugh-
ters, who were cousin-germans; and 8 out of each family were
married.-A rape, committed by a soldier, about 50 years
