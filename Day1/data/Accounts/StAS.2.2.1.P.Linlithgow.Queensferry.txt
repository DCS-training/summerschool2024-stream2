                PARISH OF QUEENSFERRY.

PRESBETERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.

      THE REV. THOMAS DIMMA, A. M., MINESTER.

          I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Boundaries.-This parish, which comprehends the royal burgh,
is bounded on the north by the Frith of Forth, and everywhere
else b the parish of Dalmeny.  In the town, but beyond the
royalty, there are 422 inhabitants, and at New-Halls 90, by the
census 1841.
   Climate, &c.--In winter the thermometer ranges from 46° to
15°.  In November 1830 it was 32° at the lowest, and in the fol-
lowing January at 230.  The barometer is not subject to more
than the usual variations.
   The Frith opposite the town is about a mile and a half in
breadth.  The tide rises 18 feet at the harbour mouth.  The water
is shallow on the southern shore; but the depth is greatest on the
Fife side, where in the fair-way between the island Inch Garvie,
and the Battery Point, the bottom has been found with a line of 60
fathoms.  At certain seasons, after floods occasioned by melting
snow or falls of rain, the saltness of the water is much diminished
by the volume of fresh water carried down by the Forth and its
tributary streams.
   The town is supplied with water collected in an artificial reser-
voir, very liberally formed, at the expense of the Earl of Rosebery,
in the year 1819.  This has proved an unspeakable advantage to
the town.  During the great drought of last summer, when the
reservoir was nearly embankment, the burgh laid upwards of L.100
in heightening the embankment, and thereby greatly increasing
the supply of water.  At the original formation of the reservoir,
the town expended L.200.
   The houses in the centre of the town are founded on sea sand,
which extends to the foot of the rising ground or brae, at the bot-
tom of which the town is built.  In the west a considerable
sandstone appears, which dips to the north with a considerable
   LINLITHGOW.                 A
