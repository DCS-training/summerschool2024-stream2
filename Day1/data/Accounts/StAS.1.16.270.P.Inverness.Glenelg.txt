salt prevents the natives from turning to advantage this
bounty of Providence, which from their local situation
they might otherwise do; at present, they are content with
fishing a barrel or two to help the maintenance of their fa-
milies.  Certainly it must be an impolitic law that imposes
so high a duty on one of the most necessary articles of con-
sumption in life.

   Birds, and wild Animals.-The migratory birds are, the
swallow, the cuckoo, the field-fare, and wood-cock.  The
birds of prey are the eagle, the raven) and grey crow, with
three species of the hawk, and two of the kite.  The game
birds are, the tarmargan, grouse, black-cock, snipe, heath-
hen, with a few partridge.  The aquatic birds are such as
are common on the west coast.  The deer and roe still fre-
quent the hills and woods on Lochurn-side; the mountain
hare, together with the fox, the badger, and weasel, are na-
tives of this country; and the amphibious animals are the
seal and otter.

   Tides.-The tides run very strong, both in Lochurn and
Lochneavis; but the moil remarkable current in this parish,
or perhaps in all the west coast, is to be seen at Kylerea, the
name of the sound that separates Sky from the main land;
at spring-tides it runs so rapidly as to render it impossible
for any vessel to pass through with a fresh breeze, and the
wind never so favourable.  Mackenzie, in his chart, rec-
kons its velocity equal to nine notes an hour.  Over this
found the black cattle annually driven to market front Sky,
and part of the Long-island are made to swim; and though
the current is so very strong, yet few accidents happen.
The number cannot be exactly ascertained, but in general
they may be reckoned about 2000.
