ploughman in the course of a day or two.  Large and clumsy
in all its parts, and drawn at a slow pace by ten powerful oxen
yoked in pairs, it made furrows of gigantic dimensions, not less
than sixteen inches broad, and sometimes of equal depth ; and the
ground being never cleaned by fallows or drilled crops, the noise
occasioned by the tearing up and breaking asunder the strong mass
of growing weeds was heard at a distance like the sound of burn-
ing furze or underwood.  The whole manure collected and mixed
was laid on the infield or bome-fields, which were required in re-
turn to give yearly crops of grain (oats, bear, or pease), without
fallow, cleansing, grazing, turnips, or potatoes ; but, by the suc,-
cessive additions of manure, there was accumulated a deep bed of
vegetable mould, requiring only to be thoroughly cleared of weeds
in order to produce luxuriant crops ; whereas the outfield or dis-
tant lands received no dung, except what dropped from the cattle,
penned in folds during the night and part of the day,-were occa-
sionally ploughed for corn crops, and cropped for two or three
years in succession, and allowed to return to pasture of the indi-
genous grasses, there being then no sown grasses for either hay or
grazing.  Of this system of culture, which had its advantages in
the existing state of the roads and markets, a remnant was to be
seen in the parish so late as the beginning of the present century;
but it has since been completely eradicated, and has given place
to the turnip husbandry, which is everywhere followed with more
or less success, and with a rotation of five, seven, or six years'
shift,-the last being undoubtedly the best where it can be adopt-
ed, as it requires three-sixths of the farm to be in grass of one,
two, and three years old; one-sixth in turnips for succulent food
in winter and spring; and two-sixths in corn, the straw of which,
with the hay yields a sufficiency of dry food during the same pe-
riod.  And such has been the effect of the drill and cleaning til-
lage, that two pairs of horses will now perform the whole work of
ploughing, carting, and distant carriages on a farm, which, in the
last century, required ten strong oxen and four or six horses to do
the work, for much less produce, in proportion to the land culti-
vated.  The chief distinction between the old infield and the
best outfield lands does not exceed a quarter of oats per acre, with
longer and coarser straw on the former than on the latter, but the
grain not quite so heavy.  Iron ploughs are now much used.
   Leases are granted, not as formerly during one or more lives,
but for nineteen years and crops.
