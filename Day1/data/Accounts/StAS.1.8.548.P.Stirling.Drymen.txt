ducing large crops of grain.  The lands near Enrick are, in
general, light, dry, and gravelly, a soil by no means unfa-
vourable in a moist climate.  By far the most common soil in
the parish is poor, wet, and tilly, extremely improper for
cultivation.

   Climate, Fuel, Cultivation, Produce, etc.-The progress of
agriculture here has been much retarded, by a variety of un-
favourable circumstances, the chief of which are the climate
and local situation.  The weather, as might be expected in
the vicinity of high mountains, and at no great distance from
the west coast, is in general very wet; which renders the
feed time and harvest exceedingly precarious.  But the prin-
cipal disadvantage is the distance from markets and manure.
The nearest market town is Dumbarton, about 11 miles from
any part of this parish; and next to it Glasgow, which is at
least 18.-There is some limestone to be had in the neigh-
bourhood, but of an indifferent quality.  It is but little used,
as the country affords no proper fuel for burning it.  The
farmers, in general, bring their lime from Kilpatrick, at the
distance of 12 or 13 miles.  Coals, which of late have been
pretty much used, are brought from the same place.  Peats
and turfs are still, however, the most common fuel; but as
in most parts of the parish, they are brought from a distance
of several miles, and as they require an uncommon degree
of attention in cutting and drying, they are nearly as expen-
five as coals.-The people, in general, have no idea of rest-
ing their laud; but plow, without intermission, for many
successive years, to the great detriment of their farms.  The
common crops are oats and barley.  The barley is chiefly
sold to distillers; and the average price is from 16 s. to 18 s.
per boll.  Oat meal fells at from 14 s. to 16 s. per boll.
