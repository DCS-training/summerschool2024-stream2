a matter of considerable difficulty; but from the liberal po-
licy of this enlightened age, and from that spirit of patrio-
tism which is already so forward to devise and execute plans
of public utility, it is reasonable to hope, that neither of
them may prove impracticable, if the public attention is once
engaged by their importance.  To extend the coal tax, to a
country circumstanced as the Highlands is, may be consider-
ed as a measure, at once grievous and injudicious. In many
places there are few or no peats; in others they are at a
very inconvenient distance from their habitations; and in all
it requires so tedious a process to secure any quantity, that
the people, idle as they in general are, seldom provide enough
for the season; and the leakiness of the climate often de-
stroys all.  This was in a remarkable manner the case in the
1788, when the poor people were obliged, in the middle of
winter, to come from many of the islands to the mainland,
and carry heather from the tops of the mountains.  Thus
circumstanced many are compelled, though at a vast expence,
to get coal from the low country; and more would provide
in the same way, were they able to bear the accumulated ex-
pence of freight, duty, and custom-house fees.  Indeed the
heavy freight would render coal a dear article in the High-
lands, independent of duty and custom-house dues; but when
these are superadded to the extraordinary expence they must
incur from their particular situation, it is a great grievance, e-
specially when an insignificant duty, laid on at the pit, would
be more productive, and less felt, and when many methods
of commutation might be devised.-But it appears not less
injudicious than grievous.-Since the separation of the Ame-
rican colonies, the attention of the nation has been very wise-
ly directed towards the improvement of the natural resources
of the country.  The unimproved state of the Highlands has,
in this view, excited a degree of public spirit that does honour
