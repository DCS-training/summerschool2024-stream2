some other small plantations, in different parts.  But, in a
few years, the rising grounds along the Dee side opposite to
St. Mary's isle will be covered with wood, Lord DAER having

is an established school hard by the church; the number of
scholars is about sixty.  If once a house was built, and other
sands, provided for the school-master, were settled, the livin
