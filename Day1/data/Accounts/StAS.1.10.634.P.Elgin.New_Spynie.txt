     Statistical Account

that this estate, bought some years ago at 6000 l. draws now
more than 400 L. annually.

   Cattle.-There are 201 horses and 560 black cattle in the
parish, besides 14 large oxen, which go in pairs either in the
plough or wain.  Before the moor was planted, almost every
tenant had a small flock of sheep; but now there are not
above 200 sheep in the parish:  And these are chiefly of a
small white-faced breed, which has been in this country
from time immemorial.  There is little attention paid to the
breeding or improvement of black cattle, except by a few of
the gentlemen, who alone turn this branch of husbandry to
any account.

   Rent and Proprietors.-The valued rent is 3055 L. 3 s. 8 d.
Scotch*, which is divided among 5 heritors, exclusive of the
precinct of Spynie; belonging, as was said, to the Crown.
Besides the farm of Spynie, the Earl of FIFE holds all the
lands in the north and west, except the estate of Westfield,
the property of FRANCIS RUSSEL, Esq; of Blackhall, Ad-
vocate.  The Earl of FINDLATER holds the lands of Bur-
roughbridge, lying between the Loffie and the town of El-
gin; as well as the lands of Greenhall, Myreside, and Bishop-
miln, in the east, between Spynie and Elgin; JAMES MILN,
Esq; having only the milns of Bishopmiln, with a small con-
tiguous property.  And the LESSLIES of Findrassie have
long possessed that estate, on the side of the lake, between
the properties of the two Earls.
