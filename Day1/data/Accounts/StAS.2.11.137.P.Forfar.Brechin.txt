manufacture, two distilleries for spirits from malt have been for
some time erected in the immediate neighbourhood of the town,
and are in full operation.
	Quarries.--There are three lime-works at present in full opera-
tion, and several freestone quarries of excellent quality.
	Nurscries.--There are three nurseries in the neighbourhood of
the town, consisting of about twenty-five imperial acres, and sup-
plying a large district with forest trees of all kinds, as also fruit
trees, ornamental shrubs, and bushes, &c. All of these are in full
employment, and kept in the best order.
	The principal green crop is turnips, but a considerable extent
of land is planted with potatoes for domestic purposes, and feeding
cattle; very few potatoes are raised for exportation. Wheat is
generally sown after the potatoe crop.
