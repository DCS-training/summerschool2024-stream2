St Marnock's-mill, in town, is but lately erected.
	Besides the above grain, there are a few bolls of beans made
into, meal at each of these mills, but the amount varies, and is not
easily ascertained.
	In the progress of agriculture, the change is very striking, and
perhaps no district of Scotland has undergone so much improve-
ment. In 1792, there was but a comparatively small portion of
the land under cultivation, and that quantity yielded inferior crops.
Almost none of the present improved modes of farming were then
known; the husbandry implements were of a rude and imperfect
kind; and tile-draining, the modern charm for fertilizing the soil,
was not dream of.

of the produce of land in crop.

	Considerable quantities of grain are imported from Ireland into
the parish, and made into meal and flour at the different mills.
A large proportion of the oats grown in the parish and converted
into meal is conveyed to Glasgow, Paisley, and other markets,
where it is rapidly bought up.
