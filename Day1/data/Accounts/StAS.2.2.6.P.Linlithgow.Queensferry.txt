   Antiquities.-The burgh has no ancient buildings; but in the
west end of the town the Carmelite church, dedicated to the Vir-
gin, is deserving of notice. It was built and endowed by the very
ancient family of Dundas of Dundas, about the year 1330. Its
extent and revenues are now unknown. It continues to this time
the burial-place of the family, whose remains are deposited in a
vault under the place where stood the high altar, and now in a new
tomb, formed by the preseut proprietor. The town suffered from
time to time, from the hostile commotions that prevailed in the
country. It was injured by the cannon of some ships in the time
of the Commonwealth, as there are balls in the possession of some
families, which tradition mentions as having been picked up after
the cannonade bad ceased. In the year 1745 the town was threat-
ened to be plundered by the Highlanders on their march to Ed-
inburgh, but the Happy Janet, a ship of war lying off the town,
prevented their designs being carried into effect.
   There are some good houses in the town, on what is called
the Vaults. The church is a plain building, but in the year 1821
was fitted up with very great neatness and taste, at the expense of
upwards of L.500. It has an excellent bell, which the shipmasters
brought from Holland, at the erection of the church. It has the
following inscription: "Soli Deo gloria, Michael Burgerhuys me-
keit, David Jonking, maerchant of Edinbruge, gifted this bell to
the kirk of the Queensferrie. Cursed be they that takes it frae
there. Anno domino 1635."  It has a spire and two bells, and a
council-room, in which the magistrates and council meet for the
despatch of business.
