  Savings' Bank.-One of these most beneficial institutions, being
a branch of the Glasgow National Security Savings' Bank, was
established in Dunoon in October 1839. Its success has fully
justified the anticipations of its promoters, and it promises to be
of essential benefit to the labouring classes. The amount depo-
sited the first year was L.248, 9s. Id.; second year, L.250;
third year, L.177, lls.; and the fourth year, L.581, 9s. It is
superintended by a committee of management, and certain of the
gentlemen interested in its success, guarantee the safety of the
deposits, in their transmission to and from the head institution in
Glasgow. The whole sum deposited till December 1843, is
L.1257, 19s. Id. Of this sum there has been drawn L.489, lls.
3d., leaving a balance in favour of depositors of L.768, 7s. 5d.
Another branch of a Savings' bank has been commenced at Ar-
dentinny.
  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
receiving parochial aid for the last seven years, is 684, not includ-
ing the children in families receiving this aid. Of this number,
some are not permanently placed on the poor's roll, but receive
occasional aid. The altered circumstances of the parish, chang-
ing as it has done, within the last twenty years, from being, compa-
ratively a retired and rural one, to a state bordering so much on
the circumstances and habits of town life, has, no doubt, with be-
nefits, produced the evil of an increased parochial pauperism ; and
has had its manifest tendency, as might be anticipated, to increase
the demands of pauperism; the feelings and views of individuals
being influenced by the local current of the times; and many in-
dividuals formerly resident in towns, obtaining settlement in the
parish, and not influenced by the feelings peculiar to a rural and
Highland peasantry. The highest rate per week given to single
paupers is 2s. 6d., with frequently house rent besides, and occa-
sionally some supply of clothing. The highest rate to widows
with children, varying of course according to the number and age
of the children, is 4s. per week, and generally house rent, with as-
sistance for clothing.
   The annual amount of contributions for their relief from church
collections during the last seven years, (1842 inclusive,) is as
follows: 1836, L. 116, ]9s. 33/4d. ; 1837, L. 129, 19s. ; 1838,
L.110, 17s. 103/4d. ; 1839, L.118, 9s. 63/4d. ; 1840, L.109, 3s. 6d.;
1841, L. 124, 19s. 61/4d. ; 1842, L. 128, 3s. 61/4d. The other
