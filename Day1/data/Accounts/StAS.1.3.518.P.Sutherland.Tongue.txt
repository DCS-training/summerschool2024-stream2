Hill), Ben Laoghal*, and Ben Hope.  Ben Laoghal is almost
a perpendicular rock, deeply surrowed, and about half a mile
high.  As it declines towards the west, it is broken into se-
veral craggy points, on one of which are seen the remains of
a building, called by the country people Caistal nan Druidhich,
the Druid's Castle.  About 300 yards below Caistal nan
Druidhich, the eye is relieved by a wood of birch, which
seems gradually to descent to a lake, one mile in length,
that lies at the bottom of the mountain.  The north side is
covered with heath, and the east with very grass, which
affords pasture to a number of casstle, horses, sheep, and
goats.  On this side lies Loch Laoghal, a lake 4 miles long,
and one broad.  The river Torrisdale takes its from this
lake, and discharges itself into the sea at Torrisdale, where
the channel is about 20 yards wide, and the water 13 feet
deep at spring tides.  Ben Hope is more than a mile high
from the level of the sea, and, except a few spots which are
rocky, is wholly covered with heath.  Its appearance, in a
calm summer evening, when partly obscured by mist, is
wonderfully grand, and infuses into the mind a sublime
kind of melancholy.  Ben Laoghal, and Ben Hope,
make a part of Lord Reay's forest, in which there are
supposed to be about 2000 deer.  From the foot of Ben
Hope to the Whiting Head on the west, and as far as Tongue
Bay on the east, the Molne, a long tract of hilly desert, co-
vered with dark heath, and interspersed with greysh rocks,

<FOOTNOTE>

*Ben Laoghal is samed, in the songs of the bards, as the
scene of the death of Dermid, a young man of such extraor-
dinary beauty, that no female heart, of that age, could resist;
and withal of such prowess, that even Fingal, whose wise he had
reduced, would not himself attack him, but found means to
get him slain by a boar.  He and the lady, or the boar, (it is
not yet determined which), lie buried at the foot of the moun-
tain.
