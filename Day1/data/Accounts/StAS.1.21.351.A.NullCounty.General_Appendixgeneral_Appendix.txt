     The Statistical Account.

   N. B. The distance by water from Lord Elgin's lime kilns
to the shore of Stirling, is 46 miles.  A small boat carrying
104 carts or 30 tons of lime shells, is freighted at 1 l. 19
besides about 4 s. for lading anchorage and shore dues, which
does not come to 5/12ths of a penny per ton per mile.  But as
the freight for a short distance would be a higher rate, we
have allowed 1/2 d. to cover all circumstances.  The 30 tons of
time shells though only 2 l. 3 s. by water, would be at least
76 l. sterling of carriage by land.
   From this comparative view of land and water carriage,
the difference appears almost incredible; yet the calculations
are founded on fact and experience, and it is believed below
the standard.  In whatever view we take the subject, there
cannot be the least argument for delaying the scheme of op-
ening the navigation of the rivers in question a single mo-
ment.  The annual saving would maintain 4525 inhabitants,
at the rate of 10 l. each person, young ant old.
   If an accurate survey of the districts in question were made,
the exact quantity of coal and lime required could be known,
and at same time the expence of land carriage of these two
commodities from all the different places where they are pre-
sently found; and at same time the exact cost of opening wa-
ter communication to those different places could be known,
and the gentlemen interested would be enabled to judge
with accuracy the objects of improvement.
   Limestone is procured in the greatest abundance at Lord
Elgin's craigs, on the coast of Fife.  It is also produced at
Sauchie and Murrayshall, in the parish of St. Ninian's, and
at Aberfoil and Leny.
   Coal is produced on the banks of the river Devon, be-
tween Cobble-Crook and Rackmill, and at Bannockburn and
Auchinbowie; and the country in general on the south side
of the Forth, from Stirling to Carron, seems to abound with
