quantity.  There is but little white clover sown, there
being but little ground laid down for pasture.
   As wheat is accounted the most profitable produce, there
are annually about 290 acres occupied by this crop.  A
great deal of land, though naturally unfit for wheat, is, by
the aid of the Edinburgh dung, employed in raising that
grain.
   Potatoes form an important and useful crop, being both
profitable in itself, and an excellent preparation for wheat.
The potatoes are all raised by the plough, and are horse-
hoed.  The fields of them are extensive; the produce on
the acre is generally large, and the market-price at Edin-
burgh high: though potatoes cultivated in this way are
never equal in quality to those raised in lazy beds by spade
culture.
   About one-fifth of all the arable grounds in the parish is
usually under clover and rye-grass.

   Price of Labour.-A married ploughman, with all his
perquisites, has generally to the amount of 1 s. every work-
ing day, or about L. 16 a-year.
   The hire of a plough, with a man and two horses during
winter, for what is called a long yoking, is 4 s.  In spring,
when there are two yokings, the price is 3 s. each yoking,
or 6 s. a-day.
   When this plough is hired to till by the Scots acre, the
price is 10 s. an acre.  At one yoking a-day, the plough is
occupied upon the acre about two days and a half.
   When harrowing is hired, it costs 2 s. an acre; but 3 s.
when the ground is lee.
   But the manufacturer pays for labour what the husband-
man cannot afford.  During the shortest days of last winter,
a common labourer, employed by manufacturers in this
parish, had 1 s. 4 d. a-day.
