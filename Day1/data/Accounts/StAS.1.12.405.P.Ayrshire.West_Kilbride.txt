cross, to the remotest inland parts over the hills, it is about
3 1/2 English miles broad; in other places, between 2 and 3
miles.  It is bounded upon the whole of the W. by the sea
and Frith of Clyde.  It comprehends in it, the lesser island
of Cumbray, which is separated from the main land, by a
sound 3 miles over.  Upon the most eminent part of this
island, a light-house was erected, about the year 1750, which

Cumbrays, and the coasts of Cowal and Cantire; the exten-

ed Frith, with the rock of Alfa rising majestic in its very
bosom; the stupendous rocks and peak of Goatfield in Ar-

the whole, in the back ground.  Such as landscape is exceed-
