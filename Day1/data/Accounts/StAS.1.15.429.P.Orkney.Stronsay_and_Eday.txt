of life, and to inspire them with a degree of importance,
to which strangers are frequently inclined to dispute the
justness of their claim.  The heritors, in general, have
not yet exhibited ready dispositions to encourage and re-
ward an active spirit of industry and improvement, by
lengthening the leases of their tenants, or otherwise; but, on
the contrary, have overlooked such indications of spirit, when
exhibited by their tenants, and have been ready to attribute
their consequent success to the lucrative terms on which they
held their possessions, and accordingly made this a presence
for exacting more rent; with which demand, however un-
reasonable, if the industrious farmers did not comply, others,
less skilful, or less active, have been preferred, merely by
showing a readiness to agree to terms, which, instead of being
able to implement, they have found, on trial, that they were
unable to pay up even the old rent exclusive of the additional
rent.
   This conduct tends greatly to discourage tenants, and hath
contributed much to prevent any improvement of the soil,
from a dread thus excited in the minds of the tenants of being
dispossessed, or of being obliged to promise more rent than
they could afford to pay.  To this cause, a suspicious and
distrustful spirit between heritors, tenants, and sub-tenants,
may in a great measure be ascribed.  Hence a desire to con-
ceal their property and their gains, one from another, and
to take undue advantages, when an opportunity occurs, by
way of retaliation, for real or imaginary injuries done them.

rationably, and appears to have suitable impressions of pious gratitude for her
recovery.
   Of those who have been affected or cut off by the ether maladies above men-

a common kind.
