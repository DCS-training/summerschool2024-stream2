     Statistical Account

   Manufactures and Village.-Several years ago, a gentleman,
generally esteemed, and of a remarkable mechanical genius,
under the patronage of LORD DAER, built a house in this
parish, not far from the river Dee, for distilling British spi-
rits.  An alteration in the distillery laws, and other circum-
stances, occasioned him very soon to drop this branch of
business; upon which he proposed to convert the house in-
to a manufacturing house for cotton: but the stagnation of
this branch of business put an immediate stop to that under-
taking also.  It is now, by the same gentleman, joined in com-
pany with others, under the same patronage, converted in-
to a woollen manufacture; and they have erected a teasing,
or scribling, and a carding machine, which are driven by a
small stream of water; they have also several hand jeanies.
Upon account of some improvements made in the machi-
nery, they have greater demands for their yarn, than others
engaged in this branch of business: and if the war now raging,
the failure of credit in general, the scarcity of money, or the
increasing value of that article, do not put a stop to this ma-
nufacture, a village begun nigh the above building will ra-
pidly increase, and increase not only the population of this
parish, but that of Kirkcudbright also.  There are, properly
speaking, as yet no villages in this parish; for a few houses
built upon the military road below the church, and the be-
gun village above mentioned, do not deserve that name.

   State of Property, Rents, etc.-More than the one half of
the parish in value, though not in extent, belongs to the Earl
of SELKIRK.  His Lordship's rents, however, amount not to
the one half at present.  Eight of the proprietors, either farm
the whole, or a part of their own lands.  The average rent
of the arable land, except three farms in the N. part, runs
