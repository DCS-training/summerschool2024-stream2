   Market- Towns.- There is a weekly provision market at Mac-
duff on Tuesday, and at Banff, in the immediate neigbbourhood,
on Friday. Macduff was constituted a royal burgh by charter by
George III. in 1783, through the influence of James Earl of Fife,
who patronized and greatly improved it. In the early part of the
last century, it was only a small fishing village, containing only a
few houses, and was called Down ; while the land was let in farms.
Earl James changed it to Macduff, after his own family name,
which is Duff. It is included by the Reform Act within the
boundaries of the burgh of Banff, but retains its separate magis-
trates, namely, a provost, two bailles, and four councillors, elected
by the feuars.
   Villages.-The village of Gardenstown appears from a record
in the baptismal register to have been built in the year 1720, and has
remained nearly stationary, as to size and population, ever since.
   The fishing village of Crovie is above a mile eastward of Gar-
denstown. The date of its commencement is unknown, but sup-
posed to be about the same as that of Gardanstown and Down or
Macduff.
   A small village called the Longman was commenced on the
top of a hill of the same name, about twenty years ago, by the
Earl of Fife, on the Banff and Peterhead turnpike; and as the
