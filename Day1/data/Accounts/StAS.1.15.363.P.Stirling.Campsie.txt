     of Campsie.

   The session in this parish has hitherto taken the complete
management of supplying the poor; the heritors meet once
in the year, or two years, as it suits them, to examine and
pass their accounts; and it may be said here, as in every pa-
rish in Scotland, that it is the cheapest and the best managed pu-
blic fund in Great Britain; the only expence incurred with
us is of one guinea per annum allowed to the session-clerk,
for keeping the books.  Besides the public parochial charity,
there are two other charitable institutions, which have lately
been founded in the parish, the one known by the name of
the Campsie Benevolent Society, instituted in the year 1786,
and whole capital already amounts to 110 L. which Society
allows 3 s. to its members per week if bed-rid, and 2 s. per
week if merely incapable of work; the other institution is
connected with the Lennox-Kilwinning mason lodge; its ca-
pital is 70 L.; it likewise allows liberally to its indigent mem-
bers.
   The annual disbursements by the session are between 60
and 70 L. Sterling per annum.  This parish, considering its
riches and its population, could afford its poor a great deal
more, providing an assessment took place; the mode of pro-
vision by collections at the church-doors, has been consider-
ably hurt by a Relief meeting-house, which hath lately been
erected in the parish; the collections made at these houses
being either employed to pay their ministers, or to pay the
debts incurred in building their chapels, none is given to sup-
port the regular poor; such houses, therefore, upon their pre-
sent footing, are extremely prejudicial to the Scotch mode of
providing for the indigentll.
