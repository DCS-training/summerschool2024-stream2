	                     IV.-INDUSTRY.
   The active and enterprising spirit of the farmers has shed a be-
nignant influence over the external aspect of the parish, and no-
thing but the contour of the surrounding hills, and other perma-
nent landmarks, could identify it with the subject of the Statistical
Account in 1792.  During a period of forty years, agriculture has
passed progressively through the various intervening stages be-
tween infancy and matured improvement, and comparatively little
is now left to be achieved by future enterprise. Within the short
period of the last twenty years, upwards of 300 acres have been
reclaimed from their natural state of nioss and moor, and render-
ed comparatively productive, and neither the aspect of the times,
nor the calculations of a profitable return, could justify the appli-
cation of any additional capital in the recovery of the small resi-
due of about 80 improvable acres within the whole extent of the
parish.
