     Statistical Account

present week, (the first of the year 1798), have died four
respectable characters, whose joint ages amounted to 314
years.-The writer of this Report baptized a child about
18 months ago, whose mother, grandmother, great grand-
father, and great grandmother, (five generations ina 
direct line), are all alive.

   Air, Climate, Diseases, etc.-If the situation of Banff is
considered with regard to those circumstances which have

ny advantages in this view which it possesses in an eminent
degree.
   The town stands on a rising ground, and the houses in
general are built on a dry hard stratum, in many places in-
termixed with sand.
   Such a situation is certainly more favourable to a free
circulation of air than a dead flat; and the dry foundation
of the houses prevents those deleterious consequences which
arise from breathing within doors a damp unwholesome at-
mosphere.  From the river, flowing immediately below 
the town, there are no swamps in its neighbourhood; nor
in any direction around it are there any stagnating waters,
whose noxious effluvia might prove injurious to health.
Thus, from local situation, are the inhabitants exempted
from a source of contagion, whence intermittents, and many
low levers, derive the origin.  On the other hand, as the 
town lies open to the north and north-east, the cold winds
of these points, blowing immediately from the sea, renders
the inhabitants of this place liable to rheumatism, coughs,
pectoral complaints, sore throats, and inflammatory fevers.
The fevers of a different complexion, which sometimes pre-
vail, are to be considered, upon the most probable and ra-
tional principles, as originating from irregularities in living,
from contagion, and, among the lower class of people, from
