time, servants were preferred to cottagers:  but since the late
rise of wages, and great demand for labour about the roads
and manufactures, they feel the want of them, particularly in
harvest, when hands are with difficulty procured.  Men-ser-
rants wages are 6 l. a-year.  Our farming cannot be said to be
in a very advanced slate:  but there has been great improve-
ment within these 20 years.  The advantages of enclosing and
laying down in grass are now felt:  the distinction between
infield and outfield is doing away:* balks are disappearing
and green crops are substituted in the place of summer fallow.
The soil is none of the best; but might be made much better
than what it is at present,

   Burgh Acres.-About Dysart, Pathhead, and Galaton, num-
bers who keep cows and horses, find it necessary to farm a
few acres at a high rent.  Where farming is only a secondary
object, perfection cannot be expected.  They have the ad-
vantage of the country farmers in more easily procuring dung;
and accordingly the soil near the towns appears richer than in
the country.  They often sow too thick; and are seldom at
pains to keep their fields clear of weeds.  Drilling was in-
troduced about 40 years ago.  Wheat, barley, beans, and
oats, are sometimes sown in this way; turnips and potatoes
always.  Where the ground is over-run with weeds, as is the
case with the burgh acres, from their being almost constantly
in tillage, the drilling is surely a great advantage; seed is
saved; the crop is generally more vigorous, and more easily
kept clean.  There are a few of these who have the burgh
acres, who push the farming with vigour, and have their

ridges, by which one-third of the ground lost there ridges called balks.
