Leadhills, a worthy and well informed gentleman.  By a re-
gister of the workings, it appears that the lead was discover-
ed, in the bed of a small rivulet which runs through the vil-
lage, in the year 1513, by one Martin Templeton, and that
it was first, wrought by Douglas of Parkhead.  For many
years the work was carried on in a very imperfect manner.
In the beginning of the last century, Leadhills, or Water-
head, as it was then called, was the property of a gentleman,
named James Foulis, who had two daughters: one of whom
married Sir Thomas Hope, king's advocate, in the reign of
Charles I.; the other married Baillie of Lamington.  Sir
Thomas Hope and his heirs became proprietors of Leadhills,
in right of his lady.
   The works have been carried on with various success, some-
times by the family of Hopeton, and sometimes by companies
and individuals.  At present they are set to the Scotch Mine
and Leadhills Companies.  The first is divided into 100
shares of L. 1000 each.  The Company have a president,
twelve directors, a secretary, and clerk.  They keep an agent,
two overseers, and two or three clerks at Leadhills, who
transmit weekly to London an account of their whole pro-
cedure.
   The external appearance of Leadhills is ugly beyond de-
scription: rock, short heath, and barren till.  Every sort of
vegetable is with difficulty raised, and seldom comes to per-
fection.  Spring water there, is perhaps as fine as any in the
world: but, the water below the smelting-milns, the most
dangerous.  The lead before smelting is broke very small and
washed from extraneous matter.  It contains frequently ar-
senic, sulphur, zinc, etc. which poisons the water in which
it is washed.  Fowls of any kind will not live many days at
Leadhills.  They pick up arsenical particles with their food,
which soon kills them.  Horses, cows, dogs, cars, are liable
