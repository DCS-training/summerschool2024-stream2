     of Scone.

nument erected to the memory of David, first Viscount of
Stormont.  It seems to have been intended for an altar-piece,
and to represent the inside of a chapel or oratory.  In the
middle, towards the lower part of it, is a statue of his Lord-
ship as large as the life, clad in armour, kneeling on a cushion
at an altar, a book lying open before him, and the palms off
his hands joined, as if earnestly engaged in devotion.  On ei-
ther side is a man in armour, somewhat smaller than the life;
the one said to be the Marquis of Tullibardine, the other the
Earl Mareschall.  Above these are several emblematical fi-
gures; towards the top are the arms of the family; and,
over all, an angel, who seems to look down with appro-
bation.
   On the east wall is an elegant monument of blue and white
marble, erected in honour of Lady Stortnont, first Lady to the
present Earl of Mansfield.  On a pedestal, in a marble nitch
in the wall, stands a large urn of white marble, sin which is
inclosed the Lady's heart embalmed; and below, on the pe-
destal, a remarkably elegant and pathetic Latin inscription,
expressive of the Lady's great worth, and the regret occasion-
ed by her death; which does much honour, not only to
the genius and erudition, but to the heart, of its noble
author.
   As we advance by a gravel walk from the house to the east-
ward, we are agreeably surprised to find ourselves, on entering
the shrubery, in the midst of a small lawn of a circular form,
surrounded by-shrubs and trees of unequal height, which, to-
gether with the surface of the earth, exhibit the appearance of
a crowded amphitheatre.  Here, and all along the shrubery
and young plantation, luxuriant nature may be seen to wan-
ton in all the richness, variety and gaiety of foliage.  So rich
is the soil, that some of the trees, though planted within
these nine years, have attained the height of thirty feet.
