   The nearest market-town is Berwick, which is five miles distant;
it is also the nearest post-town.
   Means of Communication.-The want of a bridge across the
Whitadder (the nearest being five miles distant,) and of a more
gradual access to the river, has been long and much felt. This,
however, is soon to be remedied. The plan of a bridge, and of a
very preferable line of road to it, have been procured from Mr Jar-
dine, civil-engineer; and towards defraying the cost, which is es-
timated at L. 2500, there have been subscribed from the bridge
money of the county L. 500, and by the gentry L. 1500.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church was built in 1786. It
