will in a short time build a new church. Divine service is in ge-
neral well attended. The Lord's supper is dispensed once a-year,
and the average number of communicants is 350. The number
of persons, male heads of families, who have the right of exercis-
ing the veto, amounts at present to 127. There is no other place
of worship but the parish church; and, with the exception of four
or five Dissenters who came from other parishes, the parishioners
adhere to the Establishment. Tent-preaching is still kept up here
on the sacramental Sabbaths. In one of the session records, of
date 6th June 1808, after mention is made that the sacrament
was dispensed according to appointment, the following is added:
"It deserves to be remarked, that there was no sermon at the tent
at all on this occasions,--a thing that has not occurred in this parish,
as far as we know, in the memory of any living."
	Manse, Glebe, &c.--The manse was built about the end of last
century, and a very neat addition was made to it in 1832. The
glebe consists of 4 acres, and is worth L. 10 per annum. It
appears from a minute of the Presbytery of Ayr in September
1701, that the Kirk-hill, consisting of 14 acres, which lets at pre-
sent for upwards of L. 30, was designed as a grass-glebe to the
minister; but, from some unknown circumstance, the ground thus
designed is now the property of the Marquis of Ailsa. The sti-
pend is 15 chalders, half meal and half barley, besides L. 8, 6s. 8d.
for communion elements, and L. 1, 1Os. 4d. as an allowance for a
grass-glebe. The average price of a chalder to the clergy in this
county for the last seven years, viz. from 1829 to 1835 (for the
fiars for crop and year 1836 are not yet struck,) was L. 14, 13s. 3d.
	Ministers of Dalrymple.--The first Presbyterian minister of
Dalrymple, as far as can be ascertained from the records of the
Presbytery of Ayr, which go back to 1642, was Mr Robert Spreule,
who was also Presbytery clerk. How long he was settled before
that date, and how long he continued, and whether he had any
immediate successor, is unknown, as some of the records of those
troublous times are either lost, or were never in existence. In
1694, Mr James Gilchrist was ordained and admitted minister of
Dalrymple; in 1699, Mr James Laurie; in 1727, Mr John Adams,
who was translated to Falkirk in 1744; in 1745, Mr Samuel Wal-
ker; in 1754, Mr Ebenezer Walker, brother of the former; in
1798, Mr Robert Steven, minister of Catrine chapel, was admitted;
and on the 19th of February 1829, the present incumbent, Mr
Robert Wallace, was ordained and admitted.
