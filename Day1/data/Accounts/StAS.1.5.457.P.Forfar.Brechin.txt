     PARISH OF BRECHIN,

     (COUNTY OF FORFAR.)

     Drawn up from Materials communicated by the Rev.

     MR ANDREW BRUCE,

     One of the Ministers of that Parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE ancient and modern name of this parish is Bre-
chin.  Some imagine it to be derived from the
Gaelic word braechin, which signifies fern; but this
seems not very probable, as that plant is by no means a-
bundant in the parish.  Others, with more probability,
trace its origin from the Scotch word brae, which signifies,
the declivity of a hill, and is indeed very descriptive of
the local situation of the town of Brechin, whence the
name of the parish is derived.

   Situation, Extent, Surface, Climate and Diseases.-This
parish is situated in the presbytery of Brechin, and
