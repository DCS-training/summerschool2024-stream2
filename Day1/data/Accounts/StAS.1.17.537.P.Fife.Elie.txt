     NUMBER XXXVIII.

     PARISH OF ELY.

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF FIFE.-PRESBYTERY OF ST.
     ANDREWS.)

     By Mr WILLIAM PAIRMAN, Minister.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   ELY, the modern name, ELIE or ELLIE; the old name,
is so called from A Liche, in Gaelic, " Out of the sea,
"or out of the waters" the town being built so near the
sea, that it washes the walls in some places.  The houses
are preserved with great difficulty by sea dykes, notwith-
standing which the sea is yearly making great incroach-
ments.  If this derivation is a just one, and if it was built out
of the sea, the sea is fast resuming what it gave.
   Ely has a most pleasant, dry, and healthy situation.  The
shore is sandy, and shelving gradually; is remarkably well
adapted for sea-bathing; and is, of late, much resorted to for
that purpose.  It is a mile and a half long, and about a mile
broad.  It is bounded by the parish of Newburn, on the west;
by the parish of Kilconquhar, on the north; the parish of St
Monance, on the east; and the sea, on the south.  It was
disjoined from the extensive parish of Kilconquhar about the
year 1640.
