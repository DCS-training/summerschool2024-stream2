required, at little more than half the expence of land-car-
riage.  So favourable is the spirit of the people to this un-
dertaking, and so evident its advantages to the public, that
many farmers propose to subscribe for shares.  The canal
will pass for three miles through the parish of Old Machar,
from the harbour of Aberdeen, and communicate with
Gordon's mills field, the printfield, and Parsley bleachfield,
the most extensive manufactures in this part of the country.
   The benefit which the manufacturers on the banks of
Don, both in this parish and the parish of Newhills, would
reap from this canal, must indeed be great; both by
the cheap carriage of coals, and all the heavy and bulky
articles used in their several branches, to their manufac-
tures, and by the easy conveyance of their goods to Aber-
deen, on the arrival of which in a given time they might
securely depend.  As there are many fine haughs and wa-
ter-falls along the Don, and adjacent to the course of the
intended canal, it may in time be the means of establishing
useful manufactures at a considerable distance from the
town, where the immense expence of fire and carriage
renders such undertakings at present impracticable.  But
its beneficial influence on agriculture will be more instan-
taneously conspicuous.  Almost the whole labour of the
farmers, and of their servants and horses, from seed-time to
harvest, is employed in digging, drying, and carrying home,
peats and turf for their winter-fuel.  This, by discouraging
the carriage of lime and other manure, and by putting it
out of their power to attend properly to green crops and
fallow, has exceedingly retarded the improvement of the
lands at a distance from the town.  By means of the canal,
every farmer along the banks, and to the distance of two
or three miles frown these, might, at a cheap rate, and in a
few days, lay in his winter-fuel of coals, and have abun-
dant leisure to attend to the improvement of his land.  It
