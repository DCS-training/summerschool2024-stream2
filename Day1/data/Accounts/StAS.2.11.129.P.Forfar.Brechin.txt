		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

   Name, Boundaries, &c.-THE name Brechin is derived from a
Gaelic term, signifying a brae; and is descriptive of the sloping
bank beside the river South Esk, on which the town is situated. The
parish extends in length from east to west about seven English
miles, and in breadth from north to south about six. It consists
of 24 3/4 square miles. It is bounded by the parish of Dun on the
east; by Carriston on the west; by Strickathrow and Menmuir on
the north; and by Farnell on the south; while on the south-west
it marches with Aberlemno. It is not of a very regular shape, al-
though no part of it extends much above three miles in each di-
rection from the burgh. The Grampian mountains are seen at
no great distance to the north; but there is no eminence which
can be called a mountain within the parish, excepting Burghill, or
Burkle, (as it is usually pronounced,) which lies on the south side
of the town. The greater part of the parish is level, or diversi-
fied by gently sloping grounds.
   The climate is justly reckoned temperate and salubrious. From
the extensive draining of wet lands of late years, we hear of no
complaints of ague, which were common in former times. No pre-
valent distemper can be said to exist in the district
   Meteorology.--On this head the writer presents the following
meteorological table, drawn up by Mr George Henderson, from a
journal kept about the centre of the parish, 190 feet above the level
of the sea, during the years 1830 and 1831.
