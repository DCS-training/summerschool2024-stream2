     Statistical Account

of the parish consists of two vallies.  That along the Her-
mitage is about ten miles in length, from the source of the
river to the point where it loses its name in the Lidda.
At the head of this river the country is entirely mountain-
ous.  The mountains are very high and steep, but are ge-
nerally dry, and afford excellent sheep pasture.  The
greatest part of this stream is fringed with natural wood;
it possesses much rural beauty, and exhibits the pastoral
scenes of life in great perfection.  The other valley, or
strath, is that along the sides of the Liddal.  Near the head
of the parish on the east, the rivers Liddal and Tyne, which
runs by Newcastle, take their rise, in the midst of an im-
mense bog, surrounded by mountains.  This place is very
properly named Dead water, because for a considerable
space neither of them can be traced as a running stream.
The Tyne winds slowly to the east, between the bleak
mountains and the dreary wastes of Northumberland, by
Keelder Castle*.  The Liddal runs due west for few miles,
and then runs due south.  This part of the country is
mountainous, high, cold and moist, and lies under the
thick and solitary gloom of continual fogs.  For ten miles
down the river its banks are entirely naked; the hills on
each side produce a great quantity of grass.  At the point
where it is joined by the Hermitage the banks are covered
with trees.  On the north side the thriving plantations of
the Duke of Buccleugh, and on the south the plantations
and woods of Mr Elliot of Whitehaugh, near the confluence
of the rivers, form a landscape highly beautiful.  Here the
valley widens considerably, and improvements are every
where seen.  From this hill you reach the confines of
Canonby; the ride is very much admired by travellers.
