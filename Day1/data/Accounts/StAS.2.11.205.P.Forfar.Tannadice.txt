The latter always draw out on the certain prospect of marriage; and
the former, when any situation of independence casts up. The in-
terest is a comfortable addition to the incomes of many.
	Fuel.--Everything capable of ignition is used as fuel, viz. whins,
broom, brushwood, turf, peats, and coals; the last can be pur-
chased at Montrose for 1s. 1d., or a little more per barrel, of 10
stones English weight, or 160 pounds. The upper part of the
parish, to which coals were almost inaccessible, can now be as
easily supplied from the depot at Newtyle by the rail-road, as the
lower from Montrose. There are thirteen taxable carriages at pre-
sent running in the parish, some of them with four, and others,with
two wheels. Forty years ago there was not one of either descrip-
tion. Few of the roads, indeed, were suitable for such vehicles.

		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The principal improvements withhn the last forty years have
been already mentioned. It may be added, that, if we may judge
by the longevity of many, the parish is very healthy. A few years
ago seven men and a maiden lady died in one year, all upwards
of eighty years of age: and last winter, a man, who had been at
the battle of Culloden, died at the age of 104, and another only
twelve years younger. There are at present upwards of ten persons
alive about eighty years of age; and three nearly ninety.
