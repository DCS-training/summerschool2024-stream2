   Leases.-Leases are generally for nineteen years-by far too
short a period upon unimproved farms.
   Most of the land is entailed, and the proprietors are restricted
from giving leases for more than nineteen years, and also from giv-
ing more than one year's rent at the end of the lease, for houses,
fences, drains, &c. in short, for all improvements.  These restric-
tions were long acted up to by the proprietors, but have been as
much as possible departed from by them for several years; and many
of them, at their own risk and expense, give great encouragement
to industrious tenants.  There is an emulation, in most cases, be-
tween the proprietor and his tenants, whether the former shall be
the more liberal, or the latter the more industrious.  The result
has been, that the rental of the parish, about forty years ago little
more than L.2000, is now above L.7000, and the farmers' capi-
tal has increased more in proportion than the rent.  The valued
rent of the parish is L.5831 Scots, divided as follows:-

   Considerable quantities of potatoes and turnips are raised, as nearly
one-sixth of the arable land is annually in crops of these; the extent
of turnip land to that of potatoe land being as 7 to 1.  Little or none
is sold.  Cattle are fed with the turnips, and the potatoes are consumed
with men, horses, a few swine and poultry.  Little cultivated and no
meadow hay, is raised, as the land pays better in pasture.
   Very few sheep are kept.  What are kept is of the large kind, and
weight from 64 to 80 pounds.
