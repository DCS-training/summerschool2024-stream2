by the Romans, or since they left the country, is uncertain.
To this place a superstitious regard is attached by the vul-
gar.  Tradition asserts, that some time ago a man attempt-
ing to cast divots (turf) on the side of it, no sooner opened
the ground with the spade, than the form of an old man,
supposed to have been the spirit of the mountain, made its
appearance from the opening, and with an angry counte-
nance and tone of voice, asked the countryman why he was
tirring (uncovering) his house over his head?  On saying
this, the apparition instantly disappeared.  The man, it is
reported, was so terribly frightened, that he immediately
left off the operation; and none has since ventured to di-
sturb the repose of the imaginary spirit.
