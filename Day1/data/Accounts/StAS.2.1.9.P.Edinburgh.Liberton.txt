zeal and talent, who laboured here till 1584,* but was afterwards
minister of Prestonpans, where we find him in 1596.+  He was

in his Treatise concerning the Fulfilling of the Scriptures, refers
to him as a distinguished saint.

parish in 1616, and a member of the Assembly which met that
year in Aberdeen.  He was afterwards translated to Edinburgh,
and made Principal of the College, in which capacity he sat in the
Glasgow Assembly 1638.  He was reckoned a man of learning.

poetry, but only continued minister here for five years.
