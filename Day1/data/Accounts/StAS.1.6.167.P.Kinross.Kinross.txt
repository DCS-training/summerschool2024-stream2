the Lochleven trout, is the vast quantity of a small shell-fish,
red in its colour, which abounds all over the bottom of the
Toch, especially among the aquatic weeds.  It is of shape quite
globular, precisely of the appearance and size of a lintseed boll
at a little distance, and the trouts when caught have often their
stomachs full of them.  These observations may account for
a phenomenon of another kind.  In Lochleven are all the dif-
ferent species of hill, or burn, or muir trout, that are to be
met with in Scotland, evidently appearing from the diversity
of manner in which they are spotted.  Yet all these different
kinds, after being two years in the loch, and arriving at 3/4 or
1 lb. weight, are red in the flesh, as all the trout of every kind
in the 1och are, except perhaps those newly brought down by
floods, or such as are sickly.  The silver-grey trout, with about
4 or 5 spots on the middle of each side, is apparently the ori-
ginal native of the loch, and, in many respects, the finest fish
of the whole.  The fry of all kinds are white in the flesh till
they come to the size of a herring, about the beginning of their
third year.  The gallytrough, or char, abounds in the loch
The description of this fish is generally well known.  What is re-
markable of them is the size to which they often grow, some
of them weighing near 2 lb. and they are never known to
rise to a fly, or to be caught with a hook, baited in any way
whatever.  Besides these, are vast numbers of eels, pikes, and
perch, in the loch.-The fish of Lochleven, only a few years
ago, sold here at 1 d. each, great,and small, for the trout, and
the perch at 1 d. the dozen, and, about 25 years ago, at half
that price: the fishing was then let at 200 merks Scotch.
The trout* are now raised to 4 d. per lb. the perch to 2 d. per

*Those called Bill trout are believed to be old ones.  In spring 1791, a large
one was caught that weighed 10 lb.-many of them weighed 8 lb.
