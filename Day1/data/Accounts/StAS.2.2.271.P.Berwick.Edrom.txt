chapel, the frame work of which is entirely of cast iron. Part of
the glass is beautifully stained. It was erected by Thornas Bos-
wall, Esq., the late proprietor, and cost several thousand pounds.
The situation of Edrom House and the parish church is very beau-
tiful. The lands all around are in a state of high cultivation, en-
riched with plantations and hedge-rows; and, in the distance, there
are the upland scenery of Dunse Law, Cockburn Law, and the sweep
of the Lammermoor Hills, and the Cheviots.
   Mills.-There are four corn-mills in the parish on the Black-
adder Water,-Bighouse mill, Blackadder, Nisbet, and Kimmer-
ghame. At Kimmerghame and Bighouse mill, there is conjoined
to the corn-mill a saw-mill, where a good deal of wood is cut for
rural purposes.
   Paper-Mills.-There are two paper-mills on the Whitadder.
That of Broomhouse is on a very extensive scale. The number of
hands employed is 56, male and female; and the hours of work
are ten per day. Printing-paper is chiefly manufactured. The
people are healthy, sober, and every way decent in their conduct.
At Allanbank paper-mill, binding boards are manufactured: and
the number of hands employed is 25 for eight hours a-day. Men's
wages are 14s. per week: women's, 10d. per day. The people here
are equally correct in their conduct as those at the other paper-mill.
-A lint-mill and a wheel-wright-mill are mentioned in the former
Statistical Account; but these have been discontinued for a good
many years.
