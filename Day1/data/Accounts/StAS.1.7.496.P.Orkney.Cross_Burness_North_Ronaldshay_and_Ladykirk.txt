as profitably employed in making kelp during the summer
season, which is the best for fishing, and their profits in the
kelp manufacture are more certain; but, what has been al-
ready mentioned would greatly better their condition; and
these, and many other things might be promoted, provided
that the proprietors were resident in these islands, and men
of generous and benevolent principles.

   Years 1782 and 1783.-The situation of these islands in
1782 and 1783, was truly deplorable.  Farms that usually
produced 100 bolls oatmeal, did not produce 20 bolls, and
the lesser farms proportionally deficient.  The quality too,
was in many places as inferior, as the quantity was little.
The quantity of grain then imported into these islands can-

assistances, and the humane conduct of this gentleman, toge-
ther with the assistance given by the principal farmers, to the
people on their own farms, none perished of want, as was the
