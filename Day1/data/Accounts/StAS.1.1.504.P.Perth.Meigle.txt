759 feet; Kinpurnie-hill, noted for a tower on its summit,
3 miles S. E. of Belmont, 1151 feet; Sidla-hill, a mile S. E.
of Kinpurnie, 1406 feet; Barry-hill, on the opposite border
of the Strath, 3 miles northward of Belmont, 688 feet.  This
level and fertile Strath is beautifully diversified with planta-
tions of trees, cultivated fields, towns, villages, and seats:
But several considerable tracts are still barren, and covered
with heath.

   Rivers.-The river Isla has its source in the Grampian
Mountains, several miles northward of Mount Blair.  Bathing
the foot of that mountain, it turns eastward, traverses longi-
tudinally the narrow valley of Glenisla, below which it forms
a cascade, called the Reeky Linn, upwards of 30 feet high.
Afterwards, proceeding through a deep and rocky channel, it
is augmented by two small streams at the base of a rocky penin-
sula, on which lie the ruins of Airly Castle, which was antient-
ly a strong fortress, constructed at different periods, and demo-
lished during the Commonwealth.  Thence the Isla descends
with rapidity into the plain, and runs southward near a plea-
sant seat formerly called Ruthven, now Isla-bank.  Suddenly
changing the direction of its course to W. S. W. it slowly
moves, in a winding passage, through a flat country, which
it frequently inundates, receives the Ericht two miles north
of Cupar, and falls into the Tay at Kincleven.  There are
three bridges on the Isla; one between the lower extremity
of Glenisla and Airly Castle; another near the church  of
Ruthven; and a third a mile N. W. of Cupar.  In the
neighborhood of Meigle, there is a ferry-boat on the Isla,
in the road from Dundee to Alyth.  Several attempts have
been made to raise L. 800 for building a bridge at that fer-
ry; but these have been hitherto frustrated by the societies
who were peculiarly interested in their success.  In rainy sea-
