larly depending for their subsistence upon the herring fishing, a
fluctuating and precarious employment, are frequently in a very
poor condition.  But they have their lands cheaper, and are on
the whole in better circumstances than the peasantry of the
neighbouring parishes.  The people are industrious and oblig-
ing.  They are naturally acute, and such as have had the advan-
tages of education are intelligent.  With respect to religion, there
is a considerable excitement, and a considerable profession. From
the practice introduced by the late minister, of causing the people
to deliver their sdntiments on religion publicly at fellowship meet-
ings, many show a wonderful facility in talking upon such subjects;
but close observation enables us to perceive that their knowledge
is merely superficial.  To the peculiar phrases used by them, they
are found to attach no definite ideas; and if the ideas which the
phrases convey are expressed in another language, the words of
which they understand, they do not recognize them. What is
most to be blamed, is a general addiction to flattery and infidelity
to engagements.
   The number of illegitimate children in the parish during the
last three years was 4.
