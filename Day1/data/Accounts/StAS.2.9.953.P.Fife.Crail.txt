   Heritors.-In mentioning the land-owners of the parish, it may
be proper to mention, that for the purposes of building or repair-
ing church, manse, or school, one-third of the expense is defray-
ed by the corporation as superiors of the town and burgh muir.
The other two-thirds are paid by the landward heritors, according
to their valued rents, as under.

		Valued rent of the parish,	   L. 13,870	0   0

   This valuation is, with the exception of Kingsmuir, the same
as the parish was rated at in the new valuation of Fifeshire 1695;
and, though it be very high in comparison of many other places,
it shows that the land in this quarter must have been early in a
high state of cultivation.  In 1815 the landward part of the pa-
rish was valued at L. 7234 Sterling, for property-tax, and the
burgh L. 1391 Sterling, making in all L. 8625; and it is consi-
dered that the real rental of the parish, exclusive of the burgh
and its pendicles, is now only about L. 10,000.
   Parochial Registers.-These commence, on the 15th April
1648, with a minute in the beautiful handwriting of Mr James
Sharp, who was then minister of the parish and afterwards Arch-
bishop of St Andrews, and are carried on, with little interruption,
to the present day.  The greatest blanks are from the 4th Febru-
ary 1729 to the 4th January 1782, which seems to have been oc-
casioned by the clerk neglecting to copy from his scroll-book, as
the leaves are paged but not filled up; and from 1779 to 1790.
They now occupy fourteen folio volumes, and are valuable records.
