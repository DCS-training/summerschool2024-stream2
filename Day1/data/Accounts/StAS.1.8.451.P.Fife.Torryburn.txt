     of Torryburn.

Besides these different seams, there is, on the north parts
of Torry, a fine parrot coal, in thickness 4 feet, which
is very valuable, and is said to sell in the London market, at
a higher price than any other.-There is also very good iron
stone in the parish, some of which has been wrought.

   Population.-This parish, though inconsiderable in regard
to extent, is pretty populous.  Upon a survey of the inhabit-
ants, taken last year (1791), they amounted to 1,600 souls.  The
return to Doctor Webster in 1755, was 1,635.  The follow-
ing table will shew the medium of marriages, births, and bu-
rials for the last 20 years.

From this comparative statement, it appears, by the births,
that the population of the parish has been upon the decrease
during the last 10 years, which is actually the case.  In the
first period, the coal in the estate of Crombie was wrought
to a pretty considerable extent; but, when it began to fail,
numbers of the workmen went to collieries in the neigh-
bourhood; and at present, very few families of them remain in
the parish.  With regard to the deaths, (the mediums of which,
in both periods, are nearly equal, and which, in the last, ought
