and finer wool, and are not so subject to diseases as the Gal-
loway breed.

   Wages of Servants.-The wages of servants are constant-
ly advancing.  At present a servant man gets from L. 8
to L. 10 a year, and a servant maid L. 3, besides a va-
riety of articles under the name of bounty; a day-labour-
er gets 1 s. a-day and his victuals; a tailor 10 d.; a
shoemaker 8 d. for the making of a pair of shoes; a carpen-
ter 1 s. 6 d. together, all, with their victuals.  Blacksmiths
are paid by so much corn from the merk-land; a practice
troublesome to them and the tenants both, and which ought
to be laid aside, and money substituted in its place.  The
same observation will apply to the schoolmaster on the pa-
rochial establishment.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages of the
parish are, a good road, its vicinity to the sea, and to a mar-
ket at Campbelltown, with abundance of natural manure
from sea-ware and lime-stone.-Its greatest disadvantages
are, want of timber, and scarcity of fuel in many farms, on
which the peat-mosses are now exhausted.
