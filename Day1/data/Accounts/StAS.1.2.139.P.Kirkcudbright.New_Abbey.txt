     of Newabbey.

   In Lochkindar there is an artificial mount of stones, rising
6 or 7 feet above the surface of the water, supposed to have
been constructed for the purpose of securing the most valuable
effects of the neighbouring families from the depredations of
the borderers.  The stones stand on a frame of large oaks,
which is visible when the weather is clear and calm.  Sea-
fowl breed here in summer.

   Food of the People, etc.-The food of the poor, and of the
labouring people is very indifferent in quality, though there is
no deficiency in the quantity.  Potatoes may here be fairly
computed to constiture more than half the food of the lower

to their parents, and useful to society, and generally get a to-
lerable education for their station in life.

   Size and Character of the People, etc.-The inhabitants of
Newabbey, are, in general, about the middle stature, of 5 feet
6 or 7 inches, healthy, active, and inured to labour.  One
young man, who lately removed from the parish, was of the
height of 6 feet 7 inches, of a make and strength proportional,
and was remarkable for a quiet and peaceable temper.  The
genius and employment of the inhabitants turn to agriculture,
in which they are very industrious and judicious.  They are a
sober, obliging, honest and intelligent set of people, hospita-
ble to strangers, charitable to the poor, just in their dealings,
and obliging to one another.  They affect not elegance or ex-
pence in their dress or diet, but are cleanly and comfortable
in both, and are truly a set of very worthy and respectable
people.  Very few incline to sea, and fewer still to the ar-
my.  To the credit of the parish, it may be added, that not a
