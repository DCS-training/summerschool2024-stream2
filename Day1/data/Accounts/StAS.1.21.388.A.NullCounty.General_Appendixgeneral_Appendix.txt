ing to diminish or augment the population, I should be led
to suppose it increased, since the date of the report, by five
or six families.
   The before-mentioned causes relate rather to the local
transference, than the real state of population upon the
whole.  It may be observed, therefore, in general, that wa-
ges of all kinds have increased since the time of the report,
by nearly one half of the then rate, in addition:  Nor would
this appear to be a mere nominal rise proportioned to the de-
preciation of money; but a real bettering of the labourers situa-
tion:  For though butcher meat, till very lately, hath been
generally dearer in nearly the same proportion; yet (except-
ing the dearth arising from the Parliamentary hue and cry
in 1795-6,) the prices of grain seem not to have increased
above the rate of one third or less of their then rate.  In so
far then as greater facility of rearing families, affords greater
incouragement to marriage and propagation, population upon
the whole may be presumed to be progressive: unless we
were to suppose an unfavourable disposition in the elements,
which indeed, within there 18 months, has manifested it-
fell to be peculiarly noxious to the feline species; cats, in
this county, as in others, having died within that period,
by cart-loads, of the yellow fever, as was sometimes imagin-
ed;-the wrath of Apollo fell first upon the dogs in the
Grecian camp before Troy; and in these days of gloom and
of prophecy, the death of the cats was apt to be viewed with
apprehension as the prelude of some dreadful calamity.
   For the reasons assigned in my original reports of this, or
the adjoining parish of Linton, no exact returns can be had
of births, deaths, marriages, or their respective proportions.
   To lay open the inside of this parish, and to afford a
sketch of the quicquid agunt homines, it may be proper to sub-
join, (which I believe was omitted in the report,) An Ar-
