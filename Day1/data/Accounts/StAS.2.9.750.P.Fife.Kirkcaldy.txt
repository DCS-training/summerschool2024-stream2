rents to this duty is matter for regret. If we suppose the popu-
lation to have been as 35 to 1 of the births, it must have been at
this period 4025. Its rapid increase after this date may be infer-
red from the facts, that the church required to be enlarged in
1643, and in 1650 Abbotshall was disjoined from Kirkcaldy, and a
new church was erected.  From 1640 to 1650, the average of
births was 174, making the population 6090. This, it will be ob-
served, included the present parish of Abbotshall, the population
of which, together with that of Kirkcaldy, is at present about
10,000. This gives an idea of the comparative size and import-
ance of this parish, at dates two centuries distant. The trade of
the town was nearly annihilated, and the number of its inhabitants
was greatly reduced during the forty years that intervened between
the death of Charles I. and the Revolution. The population has
been gradually increasing for a century past.

in order to make a return to Parliament, will serve to exhibit the
state of the population at present. The return contained the num-
ber of persons who slept in the parish on the night of the 6th June.
