upon them, have been up-set and wrecked.  The flood, in-
deed, is more dangerous than the ebb, as it has been known
to tumble a ship's anchor over and over.  It is the general
opinion of the inhabitants, natives of the parish, that this
frith is gradually shutting up.  This opinion is not founded
on the tradition of their fathers only; it is founded on their
own observations.  The navigation of the frith they find is
becoming daily more difficult; new sand-banks frequently
appear; and, upon the S W. of the parish, many acres are
now excellent salt pasture, which not long ago the tides
covered, when they consisted of sleach and sand.

   Fish.-Several kinds of fish abound on this coast, such as
slounders, skate, cod, soles, shrimps, etc.  Turbot are rare.
It is an observation of the inhabitants, founded on expe-
rience, that herrings frequent this coast periodically.  About
6 years ago, they were found in vast shoals; from that peri-
ed till lately, few could be seen; at present (1793) they every
where abound.

   Ecclesiastical State-The manse was built about 1730,
and enlarged about 1769.  Like many public buildings of
this kind in the country, it was not sufficiently executed; and
now the heritors propose to give it some repairs.  The church
was built in 1776, and, in its structure, it is elegant, conve-
nient, and sufficient.  The glebe, which at present lies se-
parated, but a part of which is now proposed to be exchan-
ged, consists of about 13 acres.  The stipend, by decreet of
1st February 1650, is 4 chalders of grain, 1 2/3 meal and 1/3 bear,
Linlithgow measure; 500 l. Scotch in money, with 50 merks
for communion elements.  The Duke of Queensberry is pa-
tron and titular.
