questrations or prosecutions for debts, the parishoners are bet-

   Manufactures.-The women are employed, partly for mak-
ing coarse serges for home consumption, but principally in
spinning linen yarn for the merchants, and by means of these,
and breeding black cattle, the subtenants and smaller farmers
make a shift to pay their rents to their landlords.  No other
kind of manufacture is carried on in this parish.  What would
be most profitable for us would be fishing; but the re-
straints laid upon that business, by the salt-laws, discourage
private persons from engaging in it; frauds, no doubt, ought
to be prevented, but certainly some remedy might be found
for several of the many hardships brought upon those concern-
ed in the fishing business by these laws, without prejudice to
the revenue.

   Production.-As to vegetables and plants, there are none
but what are common in the country, except in the den of
Auchmedden, where there are some rare herbs.  And for trees,
except a few fruit-trees in the garden of Aberdour, and in
the minister's garden, there is not one that deserves the name
of a tree, though, in former times, it is evident that there has
been plenty of growing timber.  The principal productions
of this parish are barley, bear, beans, pease, oats, turnips, po-
tatoes, greens, and cabbages.  The staple commodity along
the coast, is barley, bear, and beans; and, in the moors,
oats.  In the year 1766, there were scarcely 10 acres of town
grass within the parish, and not one ounce of hay made; now
every subtenant or cottager who has a croft of land (and
there are only 3 tradesmen in the parish who have no croft),
