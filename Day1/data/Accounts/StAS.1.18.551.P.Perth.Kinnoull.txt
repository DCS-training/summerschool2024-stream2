   Church of Kinnoul, Manse and Stipend.-Sir Robert Erskine,
Lord of Erskine, and great Chamberlain of Scotland, in the
reign of David Bruce, gave in pure alms to the monastery of
Cambuskenneth, the patronage of the church of Kinnoul,
with some lands lying in Strathern.  He was proprietor of the
barony of Kinnoul, in which he was succeeded by Sir Nichol
Erskine his second son.  It was usual for the abbeys or monas-
tries, to retain the rectory tithes of the churches which were
gifted to them, and to maintain an officiating vicar out of the
small tithes; but this was not the case, with respect to the
church of Kinnoul.  The monastery always presented a rector
or parson, who, in consequence, received the rectory tithes,
or at least, a part of them, as he could agree with the mo-
nastery.
   The Patron Saint of the Church of Kinnoul, was St Con-
stantine.
