     Statistical Account

herrings, butter, beef and hides: all of which, except the
ling, are sent to Leith.  Formerly Dutch and Hamburgh
merchants traded to this country, and carried off the pro-
ducts, bringing such necessaries as the people needed.

   Heritors, Rent.-There are twelve heritors, but seven of
them hold very inconsiderable property.  They all reside
in the ministry, except three.-The rent of the parish cannot
easily be ascertained, because the tenants are obliged to fish
to their landmasters, at a stipulated low price, besides pay-
ing a small rent for the land they possess.  No valuation
has ever taken place in the country.  The fishing-farmer,
as he may be called has his lands for about 5 s. or 6 s. a
merk; but being obliged to fish to his landlord, and recei-
ving from him a lower price for his fish and oil than he
could otherwise obtain, the proprietor thereby increases his
rent considerably.  But the quantity of products annually
being casual, makes it still more difficult to establish the
just rent.

   Church.-The living of the minister is casual, depend-
ing annually on the state of the tithable subjects: but the
teinds have been let for L. 66 Sterling, including 7 merks
of glebe-land, which lies at a distance from the manse.
The half of the corn-teind of Papa, paid in ipsa corpora,
retained in the incumbent's own hand, and valued at L. 6
Sterling, forms part of the stipend.  In all, it amounts to
L. 72 Sterling per annum.  There is a process of augmen-
tation now (1797) pending before the Court of Session,
for these nine years past, and it is supposed will be de-
termined soon.  The vacant tithes, from which the aug-
mentation will arise, are about L. 20 Sterling.  The
glebe is not considerable in value.-Lord Dundas of Aske
