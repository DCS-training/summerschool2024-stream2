     NUMBER XXXVIII.

     PARISH OF BURNTISLAND.

     ( COUNTY OF FIFE )

     By the Rev. MR. JAMES WEMYSS.

     Name, Situation, Etc.

   It is difficult to ascertain the origin of the name.  The tra-
ditional story is, that is arose from buring of a few
fishermen's huts, upon a small island on the west side of the
harbour, which induced them to take up their residence, where
the town now islands.  Originally, however, the parish was
designed Kinghorn-wester.  It is situated in the county of
Fife, on the first of Forth, north and by the west, from Leith, a-
bout 6 miles.  It is in the presbytery of Kirkaldy, the synod and
county of Fife.  From east to west in may extend about 3 miles,
and nearly as far from south to north.

   Town and Climate.-The town of Burntisland is pleasantly
situated, upon a peninsula, surrounded by hills to the north,
in the form of an amphitheatre.  They lie at the distance of a-
bout half a mile, and happily occasion much warmth and shel-
ter.  The climate is very healthful.  The air, dry and clear,
rather sharp.  Many of inhabitants live to a good old age.
They enjoy the benefit of fine dry walks of great extent, and
