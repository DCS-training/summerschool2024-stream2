     Statistical Account

   Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.-The parish is beautifully
situated upon the river Clyde, in the Presbytery of Dum-
barton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr.  The church stands
near the turnpike road, 10 miles below Glasgow.  Before
the disjunction of New Kilpatrick, the parish was of great
extent.  It is still, however, larger than the ordinary size
of parishes in this part of the country, being about 8 miles
long, and, in some places, from 3 to 4 miles broad.  The
soil of the arable part of the parish is generally thin, san-
dy, or gravellish; but it is in some places clay, and in o-
thers clay with a till bottom.  The surface of the low
part of the district, towards Clyde, is rather plain and le-

places covered with heath and wood.

   Rivers, Hills and Prospects.-The principal river is the
Clyde, and it is the boundary of the parish upon the south.
It abounds with salmon, smelts and trouts, which are
caught in great plenty; and herrings have been taken, as
high up the river as Lord Sempill's house, about a mile
above the church.  There are several smaller rivulets,
which, as will be afterwards shown, have added very
much, by the number of works erected upon them, both
to the wealth and population of the parish.  From the
hills above the church, which are continuations of the 
Grampians, and from one in particular, called Dumbucks,
there are excellent distant views, terminated on the one
hand by the losty mountains of Arran, with their heads
sometimes above the clouds, and on the other, by the
soaring top of Benlomond.  From the Chapel hill, the
property of the family of Blantyre, and from Dalnotter
hill, the property of the Lord President, both situated up-
on the turnpike road from Glasgow to Dumbarton, with-
in half a mile of the church, the observer is delighted
with the variety of the scenery, and richness of the pro-
