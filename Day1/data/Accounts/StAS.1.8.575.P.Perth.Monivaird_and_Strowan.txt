   Population.-The inhabitants have greatly decreased within
these last 40 years.  This decrease is chiefly owing to the
union of some of the small arable farms, and to the removal
of many of the cotters to the neighbouring villages of Criess
and Comrie.

   Antiquities.-There are no crosses nor obelisks in the parish,
except the cross in the market place at Strowan, concerning
which there is nothing remarkable, but that the initials of
JESUS NAZARENTUS REX JUDAORUM are the only characters
