for the first week milk should be given it cautiously; after
which it may be given more freely; and when about ten
days old it should be bled.  It may then get as much sweet
milk, fresh from the cow, as it can take, three times a day;
and a large piece of chalk should be hung in the box,
which it will lick occasionally.  The bleeding should be re-
peated once a week, and it will be fine veal in ten weeks.
It should never be killed sooner, but three months, or
even older, the veal will be excellent, and will weigh
from 10 to 11 stone, of 16 lb. each.  The frequent bleed-
ing prevents diseases from plethora, which calves are sub-
ject to, even when not so high fed; and still more when
they are.  And the chalk contributes nothing to the
whiteness of the veal, but it amuses the animal, and it cor-
rects the acidity in the stomach, which might otherwise
happen, and which frequently does happen.  At all times
when they loath the milk, and do not feed well, let them
be bled.  A cow calf is the best for veal.  if a bull calf,
he should be cut at about a week old, otherwise the veal
will neither be so good nor so white.

   Pigs.-Pigs are in general to be found in the farm-yards
of proprietors only.  Those in this parish are mostly, it not
all, of the Chinese breed, which are never measly; but
sometime they lose the use of their feet, of which they
seldom recover.  They are very prolific, and easily brought
up; they pick up their food in a straw-yard, or about the
doors, and live upon what otherwise would be lost.  They
may be fed upon clover, yams, potatoes, or the refuse of the
kitchen, and will fatten upon damaged corn; but it shut
up for eight or ten days, and fed upon ground peace or
beans, at a very small expence, they become excellent
meat at all ages; indeed all their corn should be ground;
very fine is not necessary; but it well bruised between
