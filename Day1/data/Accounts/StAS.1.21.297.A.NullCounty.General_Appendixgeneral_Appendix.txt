it is principally carried on by men hired from Nairn, Find-
horn, or Speymouth.
   Thus it seems evident, that opening the Strathlochy Canal,
would be productive of very great advantages to the High-
lands, in respect of the fisheries alone.  Besides these, how-
ever, there are many other articles of commerce, which
would occupy the sailor, the handycrafstsman, and the la-
bourer.  Men of all these denominations would find con-
stant employment, about the slate works of Eisdale and Bala-
chaolais, the lead mines of Suanard, the copper mines of
Kishorn (near Applecross), and the marble quarries of Tiree
and Icolumcill: to which may be added, the limestone, shell
sand, and kelp of the Western Islands, and all the oak woods
of the west coast, especially those of Lorn, Appin, Motyen
and Ardnamurchan*.  But, without dwelling any longer
on particulars, it may be rarely affirmed, that, by fishing,
and an interchange of commodities between the east and
west coasts of Scotland, through this canal, exclusive of the
advantages in trade and the number of people occupied in
different works, fifty seamen for one now, at a moderate
calculation, might be employed in those parts.  Connected
with the other two canals, this one would occasion a circu-
lation in trade; which is as necessary to the existence of the
commercial system, as the circulation of fluids is to that of
the animal body.  And, lastly, all the improvements in
fishing, farming, mechanics, and manufactures, of the east
country, might easily be communicated to the inhabitants of
the west.

*Several of these articles are manufactured already, but not near so exten-
sively as they might be, were the communication with the east coast, through
this canal, opened.  The proprietors of those places are deeply interested in
promoting this plan.
