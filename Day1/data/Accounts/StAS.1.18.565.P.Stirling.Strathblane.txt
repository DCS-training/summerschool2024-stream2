   The general appearance of the country is agreeably pictu-
resque.  Coming from the south, the traveller at first ascends
from the fertile fields of New-kirkpatrick, into what appears
an extensive heath; but which he no sooner enters, than he
finds it interspersed with cultivated fields, and here and there
observes a lake of several acres.  Descending into the valley, he
is charmed with the verdure of the country, the mildness of the
air, and the appearance of chearfulness and plenty, which is
displayed around.  Several neat villas scattered along the bot-

In summer, the landscape is enriched and adorned by the
luxuriant foliage of the woods with which the hills are skirted,
and the whole receives an air of grandeur, from the abrupt
precipices in which the hills terminate.  Toward the west,
the hill of Dumgoiack, on the Duntreath estate, presents a
singular and striking appearance.  Insulated in the middle of
the valley, of a conical figure, and compleatly clothed with
wood, it arrests the attention; whilst a shoulder of the oppo-
site hill, projecting like the pedestal of an arch, directs the
eye, as it were through an immense vista, to the plains be-
low, when the whole prospect is bounded by the distant
mountains on the side of Lochlomond.

   Cultivation and Produce.-For many years past the farmers
have paid considerable attention to the improvement of their
lands; and perhaps the state of agriculture is nearly as far
advanced as the nature of the soil will admit.  Already in-
closed, for the most part dry, and originally quick and fer-
tile, it requires only to be manured and laboured, in order to
produce plentifully.  The manure chiefly used is lime, and
the opportunity of getting it readily from the neighbouring
parishes of Campsie and Baldernock, has caused it to be gene-
