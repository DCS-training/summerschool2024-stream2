to carry off the water, and no more, and made them all of
18 feet broad.
   He made the first attempt to level in a manner recom-
mended by Dr Anderson; but he found it too difficult to
execute, perhaps from not clearly understanding the Doc-
tor's method.  He therefore did the whole with the spade.
He first opened a trench of about 10 feet wide, and extend-
ing from end to end of the field, in the same direction he
meant to lay the ridges, laid up the upper surface of the
10 feet trench upon the side of the ditch, to be removed
afterwards; then made up all the low spaces, or former fur-
rows, with the undersoil, from the crowns or rising grounds,
with spade and wheel-barrow, if near, and if at a distance,
with carts.  He raised this trench with the undersoil, also
brought from both ends, towards the middle of the field, in
such sort as to form an inclined plain, falling off at both
ends, and to drain it completely by its own furrows, which
were to run into the ditches on each side of the field.  When
this undersoil had got its proper shape, he marked off an-
other 10 feet trench, and, with the spade alone, threw the
upper soil of the second trench upon the new formed under
soil of the first, so as to cover it completely with the same
cultivated earth uppermost, which had been the upper sur-
face before; and so on through the whole field, until he
came to the last trench, upon which, when the proper shape
was given with the under soil, the upper soil, which had
been laid up upon the edge of the first trench, was carted
round and laid on, which completed the operation.  The
appearance of the field then was uniform and regular, rising
in the middle, and falling off at both ends towards the
ditches which receives the surface water.  It was then di-
vided into 18 feet ridges, and continues so; and by this
means the whole field was levelled, without burying any
part of the original surface.  The expence of this, upon a
