sides from notch to notch as the weigher chooses.  Now, it
is evident, that this addition to the short arm must dimi-
nish the weight; and, that in adjusting the lever, the mea-
sure of the short arm ought to be taken from the pivot of
the hook to the pivot of the center of motion, and not from
the end of the beam, as is the practice, which makes a 6th
part of difference.  For, if you suppose this arm of the le-
ver, which is precisely the cafe, by the one measurement
to be 7 inches, and by the other only 6; or, dividing the
same, in the one cafe, into 28 parts, or quarters of inches,
and in the other into 24 of these quarters; then, according
to the mechanical principles of the lever, the weights will
be inversely as their distances, and 24 the weights will
be inversely as their distances, and 24 merks at the hook
will balance 28 upon the opposite arm, and there will be a
loss to the receiver of 4 merks upon every setting, or repe-
tition of the first error, occasioned by not making the mea-
sure from notch to notch on the long arm of the lever of
the proper length, viz. from the centre of the pivot of the
hook to the centre of the pivot of the point of motion; of
course, the loss to the receiver, upon the miel, will be 20
merks; upon the 9 settings, 32 merks; and upon the 12
settings, 44; being nearly the 7th part of the whole re-
ceipt.
   To cure this original defect, a very inadequate remedy
has been applied, viz. the person weighing adds setting
more to the weight, by sliding forward the ring to which
the balance is appended half way to the next notch; for it
must be observed, that every notch forms a setting.  Of
old, they have probably had some standard weight equal to
the miel; and, finding the punlar miel to fall short of it, or
perhaps not to correspond with its constituent parts upon the
bismar, another Danish weight, weighing one setting, and
upon nearly the same principles, they have thought to rec-
tify the mistake in this imperfect manner, not having been
