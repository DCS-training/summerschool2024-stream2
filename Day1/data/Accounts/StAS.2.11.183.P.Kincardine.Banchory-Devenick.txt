	In forming that Part of the turnpike road which passes through
the estate of Ardo, a stone coffin, in the formation of which no
tool appeared to have been employed, was dug up. It was bed-
ded in shingle (not sand,) was only two feet and a half long, and
two broad, and contained an urn within, which was a human scull
of a small size, but apparently that of an adult.

			      III.-POPULATION.
	At the time of Dr Webster's report, the population amounted
to 1495. In 1792, when the last Statistical Account was publish-
ed, it amounted to 1700, of whom 744 were males. According
to the census of 1821, it had increased to 2222, and by the census
of 1831, it is as under:

	The increased population of this parish during the present cen-
tury, is to be ascribed chiefly to two causes--the introduction of
vaccination in 1803, and the parcelling out tracts of uncultivated
land, with proper encouragement to small tenants, who, whilst they
earned a subsistence by labour in the granite quarries and peat-
mosses in, the vicinity of Aberdeen, improved, the land allotted to
them; by which means much useless land has been cultivated.
This plan is still in operation. It was introduced by Mr Menzies,
and has been folloved up by Mr Thomson and Miss Fordyce, with
considerable success.
	Character of the People, &c.--The general habits of the people are
decent and orderly. They are attentive to the duties of religion,
and violations of the Sabbath day are, much to their credit, ex-
tremely rare. Poaching, and, I may add, smuggling, are unknown
among us.
