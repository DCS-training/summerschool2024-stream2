tion to the improvement of this staple of our country which
it merits.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In antient times, the Gaelic
language alone was spoken in this parish; and, even in the
memory of man, it extended many miles farther down the
country than it now does.  The limits of this antient tongue,
however, are daily narrowed here as every where else, by the
increasing intercourse with the low country.  At present,
every body understands English, though the Gaelic is chiefly
in use.  The service in church is performed in English in
the forenoon, and in Gaelic in the afternoon.
   The stipend is 62 l. 10 s. in money, together with a chal-
der of barley, and a chalder of oat-meal.  The glebe consists
of above 15 Scotch acres of ground of good quality, partly
arable, and partly meadow.  The manse is a commodious
building, and in good repair.  The church is a forry edifice;
but is about to receive some repairs, which, it is hoped, will
render it a decent place of worship.
   The antiquities of this parish are neither numerous nor
important.  On a rising ground, in the neighbourhood of
the manse, and facing the south, there is a circle of stones,
which there is room to believe to be a relic of Druidisin.
It consists of 10 large stones, placed circularly, with a larger
one in the middle.  They seem to have stood originally on
one end, but have now fallen, and are partly sunk into the
earth.  From this circumstance, it seems to be, that the.
Highlanders, when speaking of the kirk of Aberfoyle, uni-
formly make use of the term Clachan, i. e. the circle of
stones; and the same term is used when speaking of many
other places of worship, both in the Highlands and in the
low country, places where it is probable that such circles did,
or do still, exist.
