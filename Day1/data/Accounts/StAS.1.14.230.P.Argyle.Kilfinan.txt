     Statistical Account

any thing; and as it is by far the most extensive divi-
sion, and the church standing upon it, the whole parish
often goes by the name of the parish of the Kerry, and
is fully as well known in the neighbourhood by that
name, as by its real one; but it is never written so.
The northern division is called Otter, which is also a
Gaelic word, descriptive of a shallow place, over which
runs a gentle current; and accordingly this division of 
the parish is so called from a most beautiful sand bank,
which juts out into Lochfine, in a serpentine form, near
the seat of Mr. Campbell of Otter, proprietor of the 
whole division but one farm.  This bank is 1800 yards
long, from water-mark to its remotest extremity at low
water, and forms, with the land on the S side, an oblique,
and on the N. an obtuse angle.  In time of spring tides,
it is entirely covered at high-water, and about 3 hours
after the turn of the tide, the whole appears to within
a few yards of its extremity; and from its length, nar-
rowness, and form, makes a very uncommon and plea-
sant appearance.  It seems to be an encroachment of the
sea upon the land, which, from its nature, could give
it little opposition, being low, level, and channelly.  On
the N. side of the bank, where seems to have been the
ancient channel of the loch, the water is very deep:  on
the S. side, where, according to conjecture, the surface
has been peeled off by the united force of storms, and a 
strong current, it is very shallow; ebbs a great way out
in time of spring tides, and gives opportunity to the in-
habitants in the neighbourhood to gather oysters, spout
fish, mussels, and other various kinds of the shell fish, which
are there to be found in great perfection and abun-
dance.
