     of Dunkeld.

   In the plantations round Dunkeld, squirrels are nume-
rous.  Attempts have been repeatedly made to propagate
a breed of pheasants, but always in vain.  When first sent
out, they are tame and sluggish, and fall an easy prey to
the foxes, polecats, etc. which abound here.  All the birds
common to Scotland are here, are some of kinds that are
rare have been seen.  Since the larix (on the cones of 
which they live) has been cultivated, the Crossbill (Loxia
curvirostra) has appeared.  Occasionally, too, the rose-
coloured Ouzel, (Turdus roseus); the ash-coloured Butcher-
bird, (Lanius excubitor); the golden-crested Wren, (Mota-
cilla regulus); and the green Woodpecker, (Picus virdis),
are found. 

     GARDENS.

   The gardens of the Duke of Atholl lie to the north-west
of the house, on a sharp light soil, with a southern aspect,
and are well sheltered.  Experiments on different plants
have been made in them.  In 1770, some seeds of the true
Rheum Palmatum, were sent from Petersburgh, by Dr
Mounsey, to his Grace.  They were planted, and consider-
able attention was paid to the culture of that root.  Rhu-
barb, to the value of L. 160 Sterling, was sold in one sea-
son, to a London druggist, at the rate of 8 s. per l b.
In short, full proof was afforded, that rhubarb may be raised
and dressed in Britain, equal, in all its qualities, to what is
now, at so high a price, imported from the East Indies, and
from Ruffia and Turky.
   The Truffle, (Lycoperdon Tuber of Linnaeus), was plant-
ed here, but was not found to thrive*.
