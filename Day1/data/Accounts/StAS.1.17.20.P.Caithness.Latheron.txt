which divides Caithness from Sutherland, passes through this
parish.  This road, when it comes within a mile of the mi-
nisters house, divides itself into two roads, the one passing
along the sea-side to Wick, and the other crossing the coun-
try by the Causaymire towards Thurso.

   Surface, Hills, Sea Coast, Soil, etc.-The appearance of
the parish is diversified, partly flat and partly hilly, or moun-
tainous.-The coast is bold and rocky, rising perpendicular,
in many parts 100 yards and upwards, above the level of the
sea.-There are immense tracts of moss and muir ground.-
There are three large hills or mountains (besides many smal-

Morvine is supposed to be more than a mile above the level
of the sea.  With a clear sky, one will see from it a part of
10 or 12 different shires.  There is a fine spring near the
top of it.-The coast is intersected by several straths on wa-

sea.  The straths are surrounded with hills or high lands,
which are covered with heath or pasture, interspersed with a
little brushwood.  The soil in general is sharp, in some parts
a strong rich clay, in others inclining to grit, or gravel, but
in most parts interspersed with masses of detached rocks, and
loose stones, the naked rock appearing often in the arable
lands.  The cultivated lands are generally shallow, yet pro-
ductive of pretty heavy crops.  What is not cultivated has
in general a poor appearance, excepting the pasture and
woodlands in the different straths.

   Climate, Disiases, and Longevity.-The climate in general
is dry and healthy.-The most prevalent diseases are fevers,
fluxes, and rheumatisms.  Fluxes were very prevalent among
the common people in 1782 and 1783, owing, it is supposed,
