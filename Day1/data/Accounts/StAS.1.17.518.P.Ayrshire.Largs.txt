   There is a tradition, that, before his death, he asserted
that he should be the last who would die of that disease,
which happened accordingly*.
   At the Outterwards, a farm in the north-east extremity
of Brisbane estate, on small holm, lying on the water of
Nodesdale, were discovered the foundations of several small
buildings, said to be the remains of huts, to which the inha-
bitants of the village of Largs, and adjacent country, retired
to avoid the infection.  There is in Largs a weekly market
On Thursdays, and four annual fairs, the most remarkable
of which is St Columba's day, vulgarly called Comb's day,
which is held on the second Tuesday of June.

bane house, with the following inscription on a plain stone, in
Which, it is laid, there is an allusion to the forementioned tra-
dition, round the edge.-Here lyeth the Reverend Alexander
Smith, minister of Largs, a faithful minister of the gospel, re-
moved by the pestilence 1644.
