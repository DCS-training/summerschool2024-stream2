then winds through a deep rich valley, till it falls into the
river Forth, 4 miles to the W. of Clackmannan, and a
very few miles only from the place where it takes its rise.
In time of floods, owing to the high hills through which
it passes,it comes down with a dreadful and irresistible 
rapidly; very frequently sweeping along with it fields of 
corn, and ricks of hay, and at times, even bridges, and
every thing that is in its way.

   In general, however, it is only a small river; large e-
nough, at the same time, to become navigable, if its chan-
nel were properly cut.  In 1776, a survey and estimate,
made by Mr. James Watt engineer, under the direction
of the late Lord Cathcart, was given in to the Board of
Police in Scotland, for the purpose of improving the in-
ternal commerce of this country, by cutting several navi-
gable canals.  Among other plans given in by Mr. Watt,
that of making the Devon navigable for several miles was
one. The estimate of the expense amounted only to a-
bout 2000l. pounds Sterling.  Had this plan been carried
into executiion, a track of more than 10,000 acres of coal,
at present entirely locked up from the sea sale, would
have been exposed to the publick market; besides many
other advantages of trade, that must have accrued to the 
neighbouring country.  The extensive iron works now be-
gun by the Devon Company, on the banks of this river,
renders it highly probable, that the plan will still be exe-
cuted; the advantage of water carriage being so much
superior to that of land.  The Devon abounds in trout,
