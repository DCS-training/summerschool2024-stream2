Coldingham.  Besides these, there is a number of roads
cut along the sheep banks, in order to procure sea-ware for
manure, which is driven in at 6 different places on the 
shore of this parish.  The post-road crosses three of the
ravines already mentioned, as intersecting this parish; first,
the Dunglass burn, at its entry on the west side, over an
old bridge, which is very inconvenient; next, at the 
Tower; and lastly over the Peas.  It crosses the two last
by bridges, built in the year 1786, when the road was al-
tered, in order to avoid the very dangerous pass which it
crossed near the sea.  The Peas bridge is 123 feet from
the bottom of the water of the burn to the top of the rail;
it is 300 feet long, with the parapet walls, 15 feet wide,
and 6 feet from the level of the road to the top of the
rail; in passing by the Peas bridge, the road is lengthened
between 1/4 and 1/2 of a mile; but a great saving is obtained
in point of level, as the level of the present bridge is 200
feet in perpendicular height, above the spot at which the
old road crossed the Peas burn, near the sea; and the old
road upon the east side rose through a perpendicular height
of 150 feet, at a declivity of nearly one in five.

   Woods, etc.-About Dunglass, there is a great deal of
fine wood and valuable trees, home of which are in this
parish; a small part of these woods is natural, or has
sprung as stock shoots from natural wood cut over, but by
far the greatest part was planted about the beginning of
this century.  There are about 100 acres of natural oaks,
called Penmishield wood, about half of which have been
cut since the year 1750.  None have been cut for the last
10 years, the remainder are about as old as the century.
There is also a good deal of wood on the sides of many of
the deep ravines; with which the parish is intersected.
Fuel is fearce and expensive. Some peat and turf are used;
