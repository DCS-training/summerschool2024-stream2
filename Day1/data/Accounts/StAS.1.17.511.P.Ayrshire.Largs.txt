   It would produce much more profit were they not disper-
sed in so many places, and at such a distance from each
other.
   Mackerel, haddocks, whitings, and cod, are caught on
every bank in large quantities.  A single boat, with four or
five hands, has been known to take twenty stone of them in
a day.  In 1793, when a number of boats were employed, it
is computed, that, for the space of a month, they took, at an
average, 18 stone every day.
   They are sold, at the village of Largs, from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s.
per stone; and, when carried to Paisley and the neighbour-
ing towns, they bring at the rate of 3 s. 4 d.
   Considerable quantities of herrings were formerly taken on
this coast, and smaller quantities are still taken at a little dis-
tance from it.
