their oats into meal, for which there is a constant demand.
Of this they retain what is necessary for their own fami-
lies.  They dispose of part in the neighbourhood, and the
rest they either send to public market, or sell to the dealers
in the neighbouring towns.  They dispose of their potatoes
and hay in the same manner; and almost the whole of the
bear or barley that is raised, is carried to the towns.  The
labourers, handicraftsmen, and smaller tenants, who do not
raise produce sufficient for their families, either purchase
from the larger tenants, or when the price of meal is high,
and the ports are open, they buy Irish, or other imported
meal; so that there is frequently both an exportation and
importation of this principal article of provision.  What
the proportion may be cannot well be ascertained; it va-
ries every year according to the seasons and the prices of
grain.  It is believed, however, that upon the whole there
is considerably more corn, &c. produced, and more sheep
