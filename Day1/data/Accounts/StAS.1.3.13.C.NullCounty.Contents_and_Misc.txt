the people, but to fill the exchequer, or the armies
of the state*; and the utmost that could be expect-
ed from them, was to render taxation, and other
public burdens, less unequal.  But, in modern times,
more extensive and more important objects of in-

in Sweden, in Saxony, in Sardinia, and in Tuscany, such plans
have been attempted; but rather with a view of ascertaining
the present state, than the means of future improvement.
