tion, that for nearly two years past none of our accumulated mo-
ney has been taken to make up deficiencies. The average num-
ber of poor has not increased for many years past; and though it
has risen from eight to twelve since the date of the last Statisti-
cal Account, yet this is not more than keeping pace with the in-
creased population. There ir still a general unwillingness to bd
dependent on parochial aid; although a few, who are by no means
proper objects of charity, are clamorous enough.
	Fairs.--Two fairs for the sale of dairy stock are held annually
at Dunlop,--one on the second Friday of May, old style, and the
other on the 12th of November. They are both well attended.
	Inns, Alehouses, &c.--A very respectable inn has been built at
Lugton bridge, on the road from Irvine to Glasgow. Besides
this there are six houses in which spirituous liquors are sold. One-
half of them might, with benefit to the public, be suppressed. It
is found that wherever a public-house is opened, some persons in
the neighbourhood fall into dissipated tippling habits, which other-
wise they might have avoided.
	Fuel.--Coal is the only fuel used. It is chiefly brought from
the neighbourhood of Kilmarnock and Irvine. The pits at both
these places are about seven miles distant from the village, where
coals can be laid down at 12s. per ton, including the expense of
carriage.
	A pit has lately been opened in the parish of Beith, at a dis-
tance of three miles from Dunlop. If the coal should prove to be
of good quality, it will be of very great advantage to this part of
the country.
