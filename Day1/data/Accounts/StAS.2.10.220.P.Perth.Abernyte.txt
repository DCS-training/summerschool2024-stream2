            sides by bold acclivities of well cultivated fieldis, watered below by
            the two united rivulets sufficient for a good mill.  And this con-
            formation of the hills and vale, with the nature of the substratum
            in some places, is well adapted for emittingsprings and rills.

               The mean temperature of May 1831, as indicated by the thermometer in the shade
                                       was here only                              57/d1

              The average pressure of the atmosphere in May 1831, according to the barometer
                                     was nearly                       30
                                  In June,                           293
                                  In July, nearly                     30
                                  In August,                         291
                                  In September,                       29

               The climate here is good, and the air salubrious; consequent-
           ly, since the ground has been well drained, the people in general
           are healthy, not much subject to any particular distempers.  The
           most prevailing complaints are, colds. rheumatism, fevers and
           dropsy, besides those incident to youth.  But the natural small-
           pox rarely appears; and now at least, there sdem to be few or no
           instances of scrofula, and none of ague, which was formerly very
           prevalent.
              Hydrography.-There are some cold perential springs in dif-
           ferent parts of the parish.  These, with the drainings, contribute
           mainly to thd united rivulets that pervade the vale, and in con-
           fluence with a larger stream below, in the parish of Inchture, de.
           volve meandering to the Tay.  Here is a beautiful cascade of forty
           feet, almost all perpendicular, at the head of a romantic den, a
           deep wooded ravine in the low grounds.
             Geology.-The rocks in this parish are sandstone with amygda-
           loid containing agates or pebbles.
             The arable ground in the lowerparts of the parish is in general
           of a light, but fertile soil, lying mostly on a bed of gravel, and
           some of clay, or botb united.  In some places, the soil is pretty
           deep.  The higher ground in general is, of course, by no mean's
           so fertile.  In some places, it, produces little except coarse grass
           or heath.  But now, there is little of that last description left
           unplanted.
