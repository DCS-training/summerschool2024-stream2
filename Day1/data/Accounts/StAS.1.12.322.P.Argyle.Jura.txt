     Statistical Account

of the island, Jura, in the course of a few years, might have
very considerable returns from its wool, and transport annual-
ly the increase of its flocks to richer pastures on the continent,
where the mutton would greatly excel that of the English, or
Low Country sheep.  There are several flocks of goats in Ju-
ra, but they are much on the decrease.  They are not so pro-
fitable as sheep; they carry no fleece, and their flesh in infe-
rior.  The inhabitants of this island would find it their inte-
rest to banish two-thirds of the horses which they keep, to
rear sewer black cattle, and to extend their stock of sheep and
goats.  As there is very little meadow ground in the island,
and the arable ground makes such poor returns in oats, it
ought certainly to be the grazier's object to keep such a stock
principally as would shift for itself in winter.
   There are one or two herds of red deer traversing the moun-
tains.  We have plenty of grouse, some termagan, and black
game; but no partridge, no hare, and very few rabbits.  A-
mong our birds of prey are the eagles, which build their nests
in the inaccessible precipices on the W. side of Jura, and prove
very destructive to the kids and lambs.  The fish commonly  
caught here are cuddies, and sayths.  In autumn there are
some lythe, and small cod.  There is a very delicate fish that
may be had through the whole year, called by the country peo-
ple murloch.  It is very long in proportion to its thickness,
and, in shape, resembles the dog-fish; it is covered with a ve-
ry rough skin, like shagreen, of which it must be stripped.
In an arm of the sea that runs in on the W. side, and almost
divides Jura in the middle, there are great quantities of lob-
ster, oysters, and craw-fish.  The marine plant, of which kelp
is made, grows in great abundance on the shores.  Before the
general use of Barilla, the kelp of Jura was a considerable ad-
dition to its rental.
