     General Appendix to

men, I most heartily agree, that instead of checks, every pos-
sible spur ought to be applied to their industry; but from the
opinion that their present pittances answer the latter purpose,
I feel myself obliged to dissent, as I think it is founded in a
mistaken notion of human nature.  All exertion is prompted
by the hope of attaining some absent good.  We are equally
inactive when the attempt appears unnecessary, and when it
appears impracticable.  Despair no less effectually than pos-
session prevents every endeavour.  In this light, small salaries
are at least as injurious as large; and if we allow any virtue
or honest principle in the human breast, the one extreme
must be fraught with more danger than the other.  If then
it is clear from experience, that the greatest number of scho-
lars, which abilities and attention can possibly assemble, are
insufficient to furnish a decent and comfortable subsistence
for the teacher; is it not likely that a happy medium of sa-
lary, rendering this practicable, and perhaps not difficult,
would call forth wore spirited exertions, and more unremit-
ting diligence?
   Another class of men are unfriendly to the augmentation,
for reasons very different from the preceding, not because it
would retard, but facilitate the progress of learning; an event
which they deprecate as very pernicious to the lower classes
of mankind.  They talk much of the pride of science, and
that 'little learning is a dangerous thing.'  With this, they
associate the idea of the people addicting themselves to vain
speculations, of neglecting their humble and useful employ-
ment, of becoming discontented with their condition, and of
ruining themselves by visionary projects.  But, on this prin-
ciple, the immediate abolition of schools, and the total ex-
tinction of knowledge, would be the most proper and meri-
torious measure that could be employed.  And, if we could
indeed by any means restore the happiness of primeval ages,
