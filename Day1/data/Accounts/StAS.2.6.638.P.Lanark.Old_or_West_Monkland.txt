   The total days frost in November for the above number of years
was 120 days, which, at an average, gives six days of frost for each

to a similar period was 211, which gives 1O.1 days of frost for
each month of December in twenty years.  For the four winter
months, November, December, January, and February, the results
will stand thus:-
