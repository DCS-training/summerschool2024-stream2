   Bleachfields, Longevity, etc.-There are 3 bleachfields in
the parish, Borland, Baldinnie, and Kirk-step.  The two first
whiten annually 100,000 yards, the last about 30,000 yards.
-Few very remarkable instances of longevity have occurred
within the recollection of the inhabitants, though to hear of
people dying at the advanced age of 90 and upwards is not
uncommon.  There was a man alive last autumn (1793) at
the age of 106.  There are no epidemic diseases peculiar to
this parish.  Inoculation for the small-pox is by no means
general, especially among the lower classes.

   Antiquities.-There are no Roman ways, nor Druidical
circles in the parish*.  At Camp-muir, a village belonging to

<FOOTNOTE>

*Some tumuli have lately been found in this parish, when
digging materials for the turnpike road: One at Pitcur con-
tained at least 1000 load of stones.  In the center of this cairn,
a few flat unwrought stones, and without date or characters,
contained some human bones.  A cairn of a very small size was
found a mile farther south on the new line of road, and scarce
distinguishable from the pasture around.  In the center, an urn
was found full of bones.
