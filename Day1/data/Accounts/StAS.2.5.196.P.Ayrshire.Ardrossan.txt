			II.--CIVIL HISTORY.
	Of the ancient history of this parish hardly any thing worth
notice is known. A modern account of it was published by Mr
Robertson of Bowerlodge, in 1819, in his description of Cuning-
hame.
	Eminent Men.--Of eminent men connected with the parish there
is no record, unless Dr Robert Simpson, the celebrated Professor
of Mathematics in the University of Glasgow, be excepted. The
professor was an heritor in the parish, and passed the recess of col-
lege for many years on his own property at Knockewart.
