	images in the cathedral, and to east down the altars and purge the
	church of all monuments of idolatry; but to preserve from de-
	struction the desks, windows, and doors, the glass and iron-work,
	&c. King James VL, by warrant dated in 1592 (still extant),
	appointed the son of the preceding laird to hold the office of
	bailie, 'as his predecessors had bruicked the same.'
	  "The lands of Dalguise in this parish, which had been given
	by King William the Lion, in 1060, tn the church of Dunkeld,
	were, in 1543, granted by Bishop Crichton to John Stewart, the
	second son of Stewart of Arntullie, and Elizabeth Stewart his
	wife; and from them the proprietor is descended.  John Stewart,
	the first of Dalguise, who married a daughter of Alexander Stew-
	art of Grandtully, died in 1576, and was buried in the church of
	Little Dunkeld. His next younger brother, Sir Thomas Stewart,
	was vicar of Dowally.  John Stewart, grandson of the first laird,
	married Isabel, daughter of William Stewart of Kinnaird.  He is
	traditionally remembered in the Gaelic language as Ian Mor
	Macalastair, and, was engaged, along with the Atholl Stewarts,
	in most of the military actions of the civil war, under the gallant
	and unfortunate Montrose.  He was also, for some time, cham-
	berlain to the Bishops of Dunkeld, and died in 1653.  His great-
	great-grandson, John Stewart of Dalguise, was born in 1689.
	Having embraced the cause of the exiled royal family, and after
	being present at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, he was subjected to
        fine and imprisonment.  He built the House of Dalguise, which
	bears the date of 1716.  Hew Stewart, a younger son of John
	Stewart of Dalguise, was Governor of the British settlement at
	Bencoolen in Sumatra.  David Stewart, another of his younger
	sons, was a banker and merchant in Ddinburgh, and Lord Pro-
	vost of that city about the year 1778.  John Stewart, the seventy
	laird, having possessed the estate during the long period of seventy
	years from 1706 to 1776, and having attained the age of nearly
	ninety years, greatly beloved and respected, died at Dalguise in
	September 1776.
	  "The present proprietor, who is the great-grandson of the last
	mentioned, is employed in the Colonial Civil Service, and resides
	abroad."-'
