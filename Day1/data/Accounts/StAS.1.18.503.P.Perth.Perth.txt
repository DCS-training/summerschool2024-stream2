     of Perth.

   The annotator thus takes away from Boece's story, that
part which relates to the change of the name, and situation of
Perth.  Lord Hailes, in his Annals, sub anno 1210, takes
away the other exceptionable part, wherein Boece says, an
infant son of the king and many other persons were drown-
ed.
   His Lordship had been induced to retain what related to
the change of Perth.  He was pleased to inform me, that for
once, he had put some confidence in an assertion of Boece,
thinking it scarcely possible for Boece to mistake, or venture
to write what he knew to be false, concerning a town only
20 miles distant from the place of his birth.  But his Lord-
ship did not advert to the disputes about priority, and other
such matters; which, in the time of Boece, and near 100
years after, were keenly agitated, sometimes not without
bloodshed, between the two very ancient towns of Perth and
Dundee.
   In support of what the annotator or Fordun has observed,
1. It is certain that the town had the name of Perth, long
before the year 1210.  There are many hundreds of charters
from about the year 1106, to the year 1210, still extant.
Any person who will take the trouble of looking into these
charters, will find, that whenever there was occasion to
mention the town, its name was always written Perth, or
Pertht, or, by way of contraction, Pert, the same as after-
wards.
   There was no noble person who gave his name to Perth;
but there were some persons who took their surname from
that town.  It was a mere local surname, as many others
were.  Thus, in ancient, as well as in modern writs, persons
are mentioned of the following surnames, viz. Stirling, Aber-
deen, Abernethy, Dundee, Kirkaldy, Hawick, Muffelburgh,
and many others of the same kind.
