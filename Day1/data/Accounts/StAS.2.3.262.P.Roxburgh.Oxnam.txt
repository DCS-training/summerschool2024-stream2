used for culinary purposes by the Romans, during their frequent
encampments.  It seems to consist of an alloy of copper, bears
marks of the mould in which it was cast, and is of a capacity to
contain one and a-half gallon.  It is at present in the possession
of the parochial clergyman.  Besides, a shilling of Robert Bruce
and two sixpences of Queen Anne were found at Newbigging, and
other relies of antiquity, which we forbear particularly to notice.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

     The ancient population of this parish cannot be ascertained.
     But in 1755 the number was     760
     In 1801 it did not exceed      688
     And in 1831 it amounted only to 676, comprising 348 males and 328 females.

This gradual decrease must be ascribed to the early junction of
small farms, and to the subsequent monopoly of larger ones.  At
present, six large farms are held by non-resident tenants.  The ef-
fect of this system has been, not so much, indeed, to deteriorate the
condition, as to reduce the number of inhabitants.  Every village
is abolished, owing to the removal of all dwellings not deemed ne-
cessary for accommodating the families of tradesmen and farm-ser-
vants.

                           IV.--INDUSTRY.
     Agriculture.--It is accurately estimated that 3480 acres are
either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, and that 16,990 acres,
exclusive of plantations remain unbroken and constantly in pas-
ture.  But it is evident from traces of the plough being still observ-
able on many of the hilly grounds, that these must at a former
period have been far more extensively under cultivation than at
present.  In the meantime, however, they cannot be made to un-
dergo even occasional tillage with profit, and are kept, therefore,
in permanent pasture.
