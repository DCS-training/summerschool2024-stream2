They are also given with great advantage to milch-cow
and young cattle.  Upon Lord Airly's farm, oxen have
been reared and fattened to the weight of 80 stone.-Flax-
feed is sown too, which generally yields from 3 to 4 or
5 stones the peck; the stone worth 11s. or 12s.-250
stone of hay an acre; 11 or 12 bolls of oats; 10 bolls
of barley; 9 or 10 bolls of wheat; and 10 bolls of
pease, are considered abundant crops; and not to be ex-
pected, if fields are not in high cultivation, and the
season favourable.  In general, little more than the half
of the above quantities are reaped; yet the produce is al-
ways more than what is necessary for the consumption of
the inhabitants.  The surplus is carried to the Dundee
market, which is find to be about 2000 bolls of meal and
barley.
   The rent of farms is from 20l. to 200l. and upwards;
their extent is from 50 to 500 acres.  There are about
200 acres planted, including bolts and clumps.
   There are 40 ploughs in the parish; generally formed
after Small's model, and drawn, some by 2, others by 4
horses, according as the foil is tender or rugged, and the
fields level or sleep.  The number of hones may amount
to 200; and milch-cows to 150.
   The most deficient crop known in this country these 50
years past, was in the year 1792.  Compared with it, crop
1782 was a great one.  Still, no person suffered through
scarcity, either in the one or other.  In 1782, as meal
was very dear (20s. the boll), and the price of labour not
so high as now, the kirk-session purchased a quantity of
meal, and sold it at a reduced price, according to the cir-
cumstances of the buyer*.
