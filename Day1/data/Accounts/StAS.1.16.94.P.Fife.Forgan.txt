   Fuel.-There were formerly some peats dug out of the
mosses in the parish; but the proprietors have prohibited this
practice for many years past.  There are some muirs that
abound with whins; from these the poor people get a part
of their fuel.  Coals are both scarce and high priced.  The
land coal is driven from the distance of 8 or 10 computed
miles.  A quantity such as two horses can conveniently
draw, costs about 7 s. 6 d.; an equal quantity, or rather
larger, but of a much better quality, brought from Alloa
and other places by sea, will cost 12 s. weighing about 112
stone weight.  This makes the fuel costly to the poor,
many of whom, during the cold of winter, aggravated to
them by their meagre diet, are not a little injured by the
want of it.  But amidst all their straits, it is truly pleasant
to see them possessing that cheerfulness and contentment
which Christianity is so much fitted to inspire.

   Population.-The population is on the increase.  Several
feus have been made on the banks of the river Tay, and
several new buildings have been of late erected on them.

The number of examinable persons in the parish at present
(1793) is about                                             700
Allowing the usual proportion of 1/4 for children,          175
The total number of souls may be stated at                  875
The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was only                 751
The increase since that period is therefore not less than   124
