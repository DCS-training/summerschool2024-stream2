   Miscellaneous Observations.-At the distance of a few yards
from Cessford Castle, and to the N. W. of the vestige of the
Moat, there stands a venerable ash tree, called the Crow Tree,
expanding its branches, and covering a considerable surface
with its shade, which, though very old, seems as yet in a
healthy state.  It measures at the base 27 feet 8 inches round
the girth; at 6 feet upwards, 15 feet; and at the clift where
the branches (which are thick and strong) diverge and spread,
14 feet 6 inches; so that its diameter, at an average, to the
clift, is 5 feet, and is supposed to contain 300 feet of wood.
This tree is of great antiquity, and has been often visited and
admired by the curious.-There are 3 corn mills in the dis-
trict, two of them on the Kail, the other on the Tiviot; one
of these was lately rebuilt, and the machinery properly adapted
for grinding oats, barley and wheat, and for making pot barley.
-There is a saw mill at Marlefield, on the Kail Water, where
the plantation of firs, fit for dales, paling and other purposes,
are prepared, and meet with ready sale.  There is also a fulling
mill on the same river.-In June last, a nest of those carnivor-
ous birds, usually called hooded crows, was discovered by a
shepherd on the banks of Kail.  There were two young ones
in it; one of which was entirely white.  By some inattention
it died; and its remains (lately in the incumbent's possession),
were transmitted to a certain virtuoso in Edinburgh, for pre-
servation in his musaeum, where it may be seen.  There are two
quarries of good free stone, one of them at present not occu-
pied; and a fort of grey state taken from the bed of Kail,
now disused, being apt to slice, and at any rate found too
heavy for roofing.
