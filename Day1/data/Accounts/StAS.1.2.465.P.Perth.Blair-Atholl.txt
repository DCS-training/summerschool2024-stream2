pers.  The small-pox in the natural way, and the measles, are
among the most fatal.  Fevers are generally brought thither
from the low countries; cold, colics, pleuritic fevers, rheu-
matisms, consumption, Ect. are rather accidental, than ne-
cessary consequences of the climate, which is, in general, salu-
brious.  On the other hand, the inhibitants are not remark-
able for longetivity.  Many live to 75; fewer to 80, fewer still
to 90, and the instances are very rare of any that approach to

the Erochty, the Bruir, and the Tilt.  The Tummel overflows
a deal of ground.  The Erochty and Garry are, constantly,

   Woods.-There is no extensive wood in the parish, but ma-

present, have destroyed much wood, by fire and otherwise.-
