   Woods.-There are not above 30 acres of natural wood in
this parish, but the proprietors of Castlesemple have made
very extensive plantations, which, from the goodness of the
soil, and the attention paid to them, are in a very flourish-
ing state.  They extend at present to above 400 acres, and
will probably receive considerable additions from the present
proprietor.  It may be worthy of remark, that in thinning
some plantations at Castlesemple, from 29 to 35 years old,
each latch sold at from 12 s. to 22 s, and the best of any of
the other trees did not bring a higher price than 5 s.

   Roads.-The roads were some years ago in a wretched state,
hilly, narrow, and almost impassable in wet weather, but many
of them are now excellent, and great improvements may im-
mediately be expected, from two new lines of turn-pike road,
proposed to be carried through the parish to Kilbirnie and
Port-Glasgow.  The turn-pike roads in this parish are con-
nected by private roads, to the making and repairing of which
last the conversion of the statute labour, amounting to above
100 L. Sterling a year, is solely applied.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The greater part of the inhabitants at-
tend the established church, and there are not above 100 Se-
ceders, Burghers, etc. in the parish.  William M'Dowall,
Esq; of Garthland is patron.  The stipend consists of 127 bolls
of meal, and 2 L. of vicarage; and although the glebe contains
only six acres, yet from its situation it is worth about 11 L.
Sterling yearly.  An augmentation has been lately proposed.
to the heritors by the patron, to which they have unanimous-
ly agreed.  The church is very well finished, and contains a-
bout 1300 people; the manse is beautifully situated about
300 yards from the village, and 320 l. have been lately ex-
