   Government Church at Croick.-There is a Government church
situated at Croick, in this parish. The church and manse of this
place, which were completed on the 13th June 1827, are in a seques-
tered valley about twelve miles from Bonar Bridge. Lady Mary
Ross of Balnagown granted ground for a glebe and garden, the
extent of which is 6 acres, 3 roods, and 39 falls Scotch land mea-

the glebe has also been enclosed and improved. There were two
places of worship besides the parish church, previous to the erection
of the Parliamentary church; these were twelve miles apart, one
(at Ochto), being fourteen miles from the parish church, and the
