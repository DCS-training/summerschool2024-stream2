of the springs that ooze through the rocks are of a petrify-
ing quality, particularly in the higher and more rugged hills
in Southwicks near Crow-fell, where some chrystallizations are
found.

   Antiquities*.-At Fairgarth, near the center of the parish,
there is a well formed of a very copious spring of excellent
water, arched over, which goes by the name of St. Law-
rence's Well, hard by which are the vestiges of a chapel, with

" To fee a flower of purple, of green, blue, yellow, etc. striving
to catch a worm, is really amusing."

*About the year 1780, there was found upon the estate of
Southwick, belonging to Sir JAMES RIDDELL, Bart, in the mid-
dle of a large granite stone, when blasted with gun powder, in
a socket exactly fitted to it, a piece of the fame kind of sub-
stance, smooth and polished, in form somewhat resembling a
rude hatchet.  It was about 9 inches long, 6 broad at the one
end, and 3 at the other end, about the thickness of the palm of
the hand; one of the angles at the broad end a little more acute
than the other, the corners a little rounded, and sharp round
the edges.  The virtuosi, to whose inspection it was submitted,
did not hesitate immediately to pronounce it to be a hatchet,
which had been used by the Druids in performing sacrifice,
which conjecture they imagined warranted by the vestige of a
Druidical temple very near the place where it was found: But
this depends upon an hypothesis which admits rather of some
doubt.  When the size, the sirmness and solidity of the mass
in which it was found, are considered, and the difficulty of as-
signing any period since the creation as the commencement of
the formation of such a mass-indeed our entire ignorance of
the nature and progress of such a process, or the time it would
require,-it must be owned it becomes rather problematical,
whether this hatchet is the work of art, and ever existed in a
state separate from the stone out of which it was taken; or if
the phenomenon is only a lusus naturae.
