is three miles.  The appearance of the parish is much diver-

mosses.  The part adjacent to Lochryan extends about three
miles, is almost level, and the soil is light and sandy, with a
mixture of gravel.  All this track is well cultivated, and, in
moist seasons, yields excellent crops of oats and bear.  The
means of improvement, lime and shells, are easily ontained

is hilly, wet, and spongy, partly green, and partly covered
with heath; and, even on the highest ground, there are large
deep mosses.  All this track is much sitter for pasture than
