     PARISH OF KINNELLAR,

     (County of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Mr GAVIN MITCHELL.

     Situation and Extent.

   THE parish of Kinnellar is situated in the presbytery,
synod, and shire of Aberdeen.  It forms an area of
4000 acres, and is of narrow extent; consisting chiefly of an
irregular assemblage of hills, none of which, however, rise to
any considerable elevation, or display any thing very wild or
dreary in their aspect.

   Soil and Cultivation.-The whole parish is either actually
cultivated, or at least susceptible of cultivation.  Even the
hills are partly cultivated, both upon the sides and the sum-
mit.  Their tops are partly covered with thriving plantations
of firs.  In other places, where they produce heath, or a strong
coarse species of grass, they are still reserved for pasture.
The low ground dividing the hills, is, for the most part,
swampy.  The soil of the hills, wherever they discover any
appearance of heath, is warm, kindly, and, is some degree,
sandy.

   Cattle, etc.-Great number of sheep were formerly sed
here; but these have decreased, and do not now exceed 447,
