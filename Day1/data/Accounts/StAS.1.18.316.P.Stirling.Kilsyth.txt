     Statistical Account

ever I turn my eye, I meet with the friends or companions of
my youth.  Tenderly alive to all they feel, and all they fear,
I cannot but have a deep concern, and ardent desire, for their
temporal and eternal interest.  Happy shall I be, if living or
dying, I can be the humble instrument of turning even one
of them to righteousness*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There is a very curious collection of old parchments in this parish.  Some
of them go nearly as far back as the Reformation.  They principally refer to
the affairs of the church, being charters or grants of lands and privileges,
from certain abbeys to certain livings. Among the rest are some from Cam-
buskenneth near Stirling.
They might afford matter of much curiosity, perhaps furnish some important
information.
