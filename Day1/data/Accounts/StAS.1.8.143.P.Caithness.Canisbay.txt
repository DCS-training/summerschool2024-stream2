London.  The figure of the parish is remarkable for its
regularity, exhibiting to the eye the exact quadrant of a
circle, the arch of which divides it from the neighbouring
parishes towards the land, and the two containing tides from
the seas that wash its coasts; Dungisbay Head is in the ver-
tix of this quadrant, from which the coast stretches in a
straight direction due S and due W. till it meets with Wick
parish on one hand, and Dunnet on the other.  Each of these
lines may be reckoned 8 English miles in extent.  The

about 50 square miles or upwards.

   Soil, Surface, etc.-Canisbay is rather a level than a hilly

There is no river, and only a few rivulets (the chief of which

to be seen above the surface of the earth.  There are mineral
and fresh water springs in abundance.  The former are all of
the chalybeate kind.  There is one of excellent quality near
the old castle of Freswick.  Heath in general prevails,
where agriculture has not reached.  There are, however, con-
siderable tracts of green pasture land, in different districts of
the parish, which require only the advantages of cultivation
to be made productive.  A light black loam, with an inter-
mixture of moss, is, where cultivation prevails, the general
character of the soil.  The rest is entirely moss, reaching, in
some places down to the sea brink, and yielding peats in the
greatest abundance, and of as good quality as any in the
