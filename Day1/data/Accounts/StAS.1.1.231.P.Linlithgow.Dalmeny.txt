the best land from 30 s. to 40 s.  The total rent cannot be
exactly ascertained, as in some farms it is partly paid in
victual, the price of which  varies  every year; but it may
probably be estimated at about L. 5000 Sterling yearly.  The
valued rent is L. 9620 Scots.

   Culture.-From the nature of the soil, which is in great
part wet, the difficulty in culture is to keep the lands clean;
hence turnip crops also, and the winter feeding of cattle, are
in many places debarred.  On account of the distance
from great towns, dung can hardly be conveyed thence; and
little more of course is used, than what is made on each par-
ticular farm.  There is a bed of shell marl in a marsh ad-
joining to Dundas-hill, but it has been little wrought.  Lime,
which is in the near neighbourhood, has been applied to a
considerable extent.  The principal white crop raised, is
oats; next barley and wheat.  The rotation has here, as in
so many other places, been much amended of late years, by
introducing green crops, and by summer fallowing; two of
the most capital improvements in husbandry.  Two horse
ploughs upon Small's plan, another great improvement, are
also coming into general use.  Almost every farm is enclosed
and subdivided by hedges, hedgerows, and belts of planting.
The farmers here are both industrious and intelligent; and;
indeed, this may be said now, of the greater part of the far-
mers in the three Lothians, and in several other counties.
As rents, however, seem to be too high in many places, it is
to be hoped, from the great number of well informed and
public spirited gentlemen in Scotland, that such leases
will be granted, not only enabling the farmers to live,
but to live easily, to make experiments, to run risks, and
consequently to promote knowledge and improvements in
husbandry.  A country course, would both essentially en-
