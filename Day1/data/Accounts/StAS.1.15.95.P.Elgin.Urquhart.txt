winters likewise, in general, are to open, that several plants
commonly ranked amongst the hot-house division, stand
throughout that season in the gardens of Innes, exposed to
the open air, and lose little of their verdure.

   Soil and Cultivation, etc.-The soil is various, and, though in
general light and sandy, is of a kindly and fertile nature, ex-
ceedingly well adapted for raising turnips, potatoes, barley, and
all kinds of artificial grasses.  And a considerable part of it
would be extremely sit for wheat, if there were any opportuni-
ty of procuring sufficient quantities of manure.  Notwithstand-
ing the mildness of the climate, and the kindliness of the soil,
agriculture has made but flow advances.  Some patches of
turnips are indeed to be seen, and a few acres are sown with
grass seeds; but the fields in general are rather in a Rate of
bad cultivation.  This seems to be occasioned, in a great
measure, by the expence and difficulty of constructing suf-
ficient inclosures; there being no stone quarries in the pa-
rish, nor any stones in the fields sit for this purpose; and
thorn hedges are so long of coming to perfection, and so dif-
ficult to be fenced when they are young, that no tenant, on
a lease of ordinary endurance, can attempt them with any

*It may likewise be observed, as a farther proof of the excellency of this
climate, that in the end of the last, and beginning of the present century,
while there was so great a deficiency in the crops, in many parts of Scot-
land, as bordered on a famine, owing to the cold and wet seasons; in Moray,
at that period, the land was so productive, as not only to supply its own in-
habitants, but also to spare considerable quantities of grain for the subsist-
ence of their neighbours.  And it is a fact well ascertained, that in those years
of scarcity and dearth, people came from the shire of Angus, to purchase
oat meal in this country, for which they paid at the rate of 30 s. per boll.
