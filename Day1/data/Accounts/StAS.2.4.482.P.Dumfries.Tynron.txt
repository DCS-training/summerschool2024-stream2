replied that he was very good, whereupon she made him a gred-
dan, which he supped very pleasantly, and then told her that he
was the King; and asked her what he should giver her, to which she
answered that they desired nothing but their own ground they pos-
sessed, (a sign she was not covetous, it being at this day but worth
fifty merks per annum, and was no doubt of small value then,)
whereupon King Robert Bruce took parchment out of his pocket,
and wrote a charter for the said land of Cairney Croft to the said
--Brownrig, his heirs ang assignees. John Brownrig of Cairney
Croft, lately deceased, told me that William Duke of Queensberry
was once pursuing him for his land, upon which he went to Edin-
burgh and colsulted an advocate, who advised him to go home and
search all his house, and bring him al papers he found in it; and
that accordingly he returned, and noticing a bowell in the wall at
the back of a bed which had not been opened for some ages, he
opened the same, and found the said charter and some other papers,
all which he carried into advocate, who told him he needed not
fear the pursuer, for he had as good a right to his land as the pur-
suer had to his. The said John Brownrig told me further, that
William Philip, factor to Sir Robert Grierson of Lag, then pro-
prietor of the barony of Aird, (within which bounds Cairney Croft
lies,) persuaded him to give up that old charter, and take a new
one holding of Lag, which in his simplicity he did. This family
were weavers from one generation to another, from King Robert
Bruce his days till the death of the said John Brownrig, but his
sons Simon and--choosing rather to serve other men than to
follow the occupation of their forefathers, have sold Cairney Croft
to the kirk-session of Tynron."
