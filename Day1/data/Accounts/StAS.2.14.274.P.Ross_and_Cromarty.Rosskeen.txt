          of live-stock, and at the other, for the best samples of the differ-
          ent kinds of grain. These exhibitions cannot fail to be attended
          with the most beneficial effects.
             Husbandry.-The general character of the husbandry pursu-
          ed may be said to be the five years rotation. The land is, in
          general, in a high state of cultivation, and capable of little farther
          improvement. It is said, that about L. 12,000 has been, of late
          years, expended on one farm alone, Ardross, in liming, draining,
          &c.; and a vdry fine farm it now is. The general duration of
          leases is nineteen years. The farm buildings are, in most instan-
          ces, of a very superior description. The improvement which the
          parish has undergone, within the last forty years, may be learned
          from the fact, that, according to the last Statistical Account, the
          rental was then only L. 2000, whereas it is now L. 6000 and up-
          wards.
             Quarry.-There is a fine quarry of red sandstone on the banks
          of the water of Alness.
             Fisheries.--There are four stake-nets for the fishing of salmon
          in that part of the frith which bounds the parish; but, as may be
          guessed from the rent, which is only L.45 per annum, they are
          not very productive. Salmon are also caught by means of cruives
          on the water of Alness, but not in any number.
             Produce.-The gross amount of raw produce raised in the pa-
          rish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows:

             Manufacturers.-There are two hemp-manufactories in the pa-
          rish, which together give employment to about 70 people, who
          receive each from 9 to 12s. per week; besides the spinning,
          which occupies a great number of females, in the vicinity of the
          village of Invergordon.
