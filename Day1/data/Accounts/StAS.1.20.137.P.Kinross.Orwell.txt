rish; they pay 1 s. 2 d. for a single cart at the hill, and 3 s.
For cartage, making the cart of coals amount to 4 s. 2 d.:  it
will weigh about 8 cwt.
   There are also peats to be had in the neighbourhood; but
these are only burnt by the poorer sort of people.
   Their manner of living is perfectly plain and simple,
which must greatly contribute to their health.  The poorer
sort have oat-meal pottage for their breakfast and supper,
and broth made of barley and pease for dinner, and this of-
ten without flesh; which, with bread baked of pease-meal,
and rolled thin, called pease-bannocks, compose the whole of
their dinner.
   The better sort, however, live in a very different man-
ner; most of the farmers and master tradesmen keep as good
a table as any gentleman of L. 500 a-year; and their com-
mon drik after meals is whisky-punch, which article they
haven in this parish rather better than what is to be found in
many places of Scotland.  It is distilled here by Mr Stein
of Hattonburn.  The village of Millnathort consumes a
great deal of this article, which may easily be accounted for
from the number of public-houses in the village.  The
consumption is not so much by the inhabitants themselves, as
by the great concourse of passengers travelling this road to
Perth, and all the north of Scotland.
