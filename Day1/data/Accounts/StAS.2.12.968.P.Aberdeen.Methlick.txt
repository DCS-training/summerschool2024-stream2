males.  Ninety-two were found to reside in the village and kirk-
town of Methlick, and 1645 in the other parts of the parish.  The
number of houses inhabited was 354.
   There are 2 blind persons in the parish, 1 fatuous, and none
deaf and dumb.
   Habitual intemperance is rarely met with in the parish ; and
the average number of illegitimate births in the parish within the
three years previous to 1840 was 11, of which 7 were ante-nuptial
cases.  The attendance on the ordinances of religion is exemplary.

   Agriculture.-According to a survey made in 1803, the extent
of the parish was ascertained to be, exclusive of that part of the
policies around Haddo House, which belongs to Methlick, about
11,217 Scotch acres.

   Since 1803, not fewer than 2000 acres Scots have been brought
under the plough and into a state of regular cultivation; and nearly
2000 acres have been planted.
   The extension of the policies about Haddo House, during the
present century, is a remarkable feature in the appearance of the
parish.  In 1803, they comprehended only 701 acres Scots, or
about 885 imperial acres, of which 186 1/2 acres Scots, or 237 acres
imperial, were planted.  Now, the extent of land within the po-
licies is upwards of 1960 imperial acres, of which about 1080 are
planted.
   The present rental may be stated at L.3600, fully three times
the rental in 1803.  In mentioning this great rise of rent, it
is not to be forgotten that, in 1803, the demand for farms was
comparatively small, and especially, that it was very common for
the proprietor at that time to receive a part of his rent in the form
of a sum of money paid at entry, and called a grassum,-a mode
of payment which is now wholly done away.
   The infield, or best quality of land, may be reckoned to range
from L.1 to L.1, 10s. per Scotch acre ; and the average rent per
Scotch acre of the whole arable lands at the commencement of
the subsisting leases may be said to be from 10s. to 12s. 6d.  The
