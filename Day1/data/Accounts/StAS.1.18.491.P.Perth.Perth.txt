tainty.  We may therefore pass on to the generally received
opinion which is, that the town was regularly built; and
fortified at the command of Agricola, while he was prose-
cuting his conquests on the north side of the Forth.
   Richard of Cirencester, the discovery of whose book has
thrown great light on the antiquities of Scotland, when
speaking of the Horestii, says, "Their towns were Alauna,
"Lindum, and Victoria; the last of which was more illus-

"It was built by Agricola, at the river Tay, 20 miles from
"the exit of that river into the sea."  (Rich. Itinerary,
lib. i.c. 6.)
   This is an exact description of the situation of the town of
Perth.  The distance to Dundee, which is commonly consi-

It is probable, however, that Richard meant Scots or com-
puted miles, as he had his report from some Monks of his
order, who had been in Scotland in the 13th century, and
had there examined the remains of Roman antiquities.  He
might therefore speak, according to the manner of the coun-
try, of the distance of Perth from what may be called the real
exit of the river.  He evidently means Perth, and Mr Whi-
taker, in his history of Manchester, applies the name accor-
dingly.  Perth, or Victoria, is reckoned to have been one of
the Latin towns, on which ample privileges were always con-
ferred.
   Mr Henry Adamson, a young man of the clerical profes-
sion, Son of James Adamson, Provost of Perth, and brother
of Dr John Adamson, Principal of the College of Edinburgh,
wrote his metrical history of Perth about the year 1620,
which was published, after his death, in the year 1638.
   The name which Mr Adamson gave to his book, was,
"the Muses Threnodie."  But, according to the fashion of
