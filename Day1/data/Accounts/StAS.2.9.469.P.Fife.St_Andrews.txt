	sary to abandon this position, it was removed to the elevated ground
	west from the harbour, where a small fragment of its ruins may still
	be traced.  Fordun states, that it was erected by Constantine II.
	soon after the middle of the ninth century; but others contend that
	it was founded by the Macduffs, Earls of Fife.  It was suppressed
	at the Reformation, and its revenues were appropriated to various
	purposes.
