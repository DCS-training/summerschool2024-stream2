   Church, School, and Poor.-The Earl of Moray is patron
of the parish of Alves.  A new and substantial church was
built in the year 1769.  The manse is said to have been built
in the year 1690, and has since undergone frequent repairs.
The stipend is 80 bolls of barley, 300 L. Scotch, with 60 merks
for communion elements.  The salary of the schoolmaster is
10 bolls of bear, and 33 L. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch.  The quarterly
payment for reading is 1 s., for reading and arithmetic 1 s. 6 d.,
and for Latin 2 s.  The schoolmaster is always session-clerk,
for which he has a salary of 1 L. 12 s. per annum, together
with the casual perquisites arising from the registration of bap-
tisms and marriages.  In the year 1715, GEORGE DUNCAN,
late merchant in Inverness, mortified (sunk) 3000 merks for the
benefit of this school; the interest of which is applied to the
education of 6 boys, not above 10 years of age, each of them
enjoying this for 4 years.  These bursars are named by the
minister and kirk-session.-The funds, for the support of the
poor, arise from the weekly collections, fines from delin-
quents, mortcloth dues, and some mortifications.  The late
Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER WATT, who was once incumbent at
Alves, and died minister of Forres, mortified the principal
sum of 30 L. Sterling, for behoof of the poor of this parish.
These funds afford a comfortable relief to our poor, who are
not very numerous.

<FOOTNOTE>

the effects: The scarcity of fuel, arising from the mosses being worn out; and
the crafts and small possessions being converted into very extensive farms. This
last measure is peculiarly hostile to population, and in the end will appear very
much against the best interests of our country at large, as well as the permanent
advantage of the proprietors.
