the lands, and their owner, were called Horsebruik; which,
in the course of time, have been changed into Horsburgh.
Valeat quod valere possit.-The present proprietor has, in-
dependent of royal grant, a very just title to the lands on
which he resides.  They came into the family by an in-
termarriage with the name of Tait; but the present occu-
pant, by judicious improvement, has raised their value,
from scarcely L. 50 of annual income, to be worth L. 300

and inclosing, in the whole parish, has been effected by him;
and whilst he has given beauty to his vicinity, he has added

where so much still remains to be done, every attempt to
improve the face of the country merits its due praise, and
ought not to be withheld.

   Road up Leithen.-In summer 1794, this road, formed
by subscription, and at present kept in repair by the same

sure, and a considerable quantity of coal, were drove on it.
This line of communications shortens the distance from coal
and lime, from 12 to 14 miles.  Both coal and lime are of
better quality, and a considerable saving in toll-bar duty
is obtained.  The effects of opening this communication
have already appeared highly beneficial to those who at
first subscribed, and they are, as far as they are individually
concerned, ready to enter into a second subscription, to
carry the measure, as far as their ability allows, into com-
plete effect.  The narrow policy of others, who have not
subscribed, and who have taken advantage of this communi-
cation, prevents them from subscribing at all.  A public good
