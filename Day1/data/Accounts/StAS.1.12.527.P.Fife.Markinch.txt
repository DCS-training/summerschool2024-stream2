Rheumatism, consumptions, and hystericks, are the most pre-
vailing diseases.  Nervous fevers are not uncommon, though
seldom epidemical.  During the incumbency of the present
minister, several instances of serofula and cancer have occur-
red.  The small-pox is frequently very fatal.  Though a few
individuals have been reconciled to the practice of inocula-
tion, yet the prejudices of the bulk of the common people a-
gainst it continue so strong,  that it has not yet been generally
introduced.  Children from 4 to 10, or 12 years of age, seem

inches long.

Forth, at the town of Leven.  The Orr is another consider-

parish, joining the Leven about 2 miles below the parish
church.  In both these rivers there is plenty of different
kinds of fish.  Salmon, pikes, and burn trouts are the prin-
cipal kinds.  There is also to be found in them a species of
trout, of a tolerable size, the flesh of which is red, resembling
that of salmon, of a fine flavour, and very delicate.  Those

   Roads and Bridges.-The great road from Kinghorn to Cu-
par, and Dundee, runs through the west part of the parish;
and, since the late turnpike act for this county was obtained,
