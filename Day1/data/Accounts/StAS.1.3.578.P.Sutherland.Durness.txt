plenty of spunges, but not of the best quality, are also inter-
mixed among those sea weeds.  The tides rush in with great
rapidity and violence upon this coast, especially on the head
lands; and, above all, at Cape Wrath, where their violence
is increased by means of a shoal, running out north by east,
from the extremity of the Cape, for 5 or 6 miles, and cover-
ed by a depth of water, measuring only from 16 to 24 fa-
thoms.  About a mile from the coast is the Staigs, a rock
the top of which is always above water; but which is, ne-
vertheless, formidable to ships approaching the Cape by
night; but a still more dangerous rock, the top of which
can be seen only in neap tides, is said to lie 9 miles due north
from the Cape.

   Lakes and Rivers.-Loch Erriboll is a spacious harbour, in
which even the smallest sloop enjoys perfect safety, and which
appears large enough to recieve perhaps the whole British
navy.  On the east, it is bounded by the bright and elevated
rocks of Whitenhead, which mariners distinguish at a dis-
tance, even in the night; and on the west by Ruspin, a small
dry harbour, lately much improved by the tackmen of the
fishings and the kelp shores.  At Far-out-head, there is a
large bay of rough sea, too open to afford shelter for vessels.
Cape Wrath, Far-out-head, and Whitenhead, are the only
headlands on this part of the coast.

   Caves.-In the cave of Smo, founds are distinctly repeated
by a remarkable echo.  This cave is, indeed, in many re-
spects, an object worthy to attract and engage the notice of a
curious observer of nature.  It is, in some places, 100 yards
wide.  The natural vault is about 70 or 80 yards in height.
A short way within the mouth of the cave, there is a perso-
ration in the arch, through which a stream of water de-
