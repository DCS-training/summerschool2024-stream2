     of Essie and Nevay.

   Surface and Soil.-The northern declivity of the Sidla
hills composes one half of both parishes.  The soil of this
division is a thin black mould, on a bottom of mortar; but,
its exposure notwithstanding, it is more fertile, and yields
earlier crops, than any part of that ridge which fronts the
south.  Towards the summit of the hills the soil degene-
rates, and is fit for planting or pasture only.  The highest
part of the southern boundary does not exceed 950 feet
above the level of the adjacent plain.
   The soil of the lower part of the parish is various.  In
Nevay, a level and marshy tract, containing some moss on
a stratum of sand, is a continuation of the extensive moss
of Meigle.  No marl has been found in the former, though
there be abundance in the latter.  That tract stretches
eastward to the church of Essie, and north to the Dean.
Some plots of it are cultivated; the rest affords indiffe-
rent pasture.  A low and flat territory, north of Essie,
consists of a strong and rich clay, ill cultivated, and liable
to be partially inundated by the river, which, in time of
heavy rains, overflows its low banks.  To the eastward of
the church the soil is thinner, but friendly to vegetation.

   Climate.-A greater quantity of rain falls in this district
than in the low country south of Sidla.  Last spring (1793)
the fields in this neighbourhood were refreshed by co-
pious showers, while the Carse of Gowrie, and territory
to the eastward, remained dry and parched.  The reason
of this difference seems to be, that all clouds and vapours
from the south-west are divided near the mouth of the river
Earn, and attracted partly by the Sidla Hills, and partly by
an elevated ridge stretching along the north coast of Fife;
so that little rain from that quarter falls upon the interval
between those mountains.  But, favoured as Strathmore is
in this respect the weather in general is extremely vari-
