by subsequent sovereigns, and confirmed by acts of Parlia-

livings, for the defence of the nation against an invasion of
the English, the clergy in the University of Glasgow, on plead-
ing their privilege, were exempted.  This right, of exemp-
tion from taxation, was pleaded by this University before the
Lords of Council and Session, on the 20 th of November 1633,
and was sustained.
   To these privileges, which the bishops of Glasgow obtained
from the Crown and Parliament, they added others which
were in their own power, in consequence of the ample civil
and criminal jurisdiction, which they possessed within their
own diocese to wit, The privilege of buying, selling, and
transporting provisions, within the jurisdiction of the bishop,
free of tolls and customs;-the fixing the rent of houses or
lodgings, possessed by persons belonging to the university, by
a jury, the one half citizens, the other half persons belong-
ing to the Univeraity;-the obliging the magistrates of Glas-
gow, upon their election, to swear that they shall observe,
and cause to be observed, the immunities, liberties, and sta-
tutes of the University;-the granting the rector the next
place, in precedence to the bishop, in all ceremonies and
processions;-the granting the privileges of incorporated mem-
bers to all the servants of the University;-the self-denying
clause in the chancellor's oath, and which still makes a clause
in it,-"Se nibil in academi‘ negotiis sine moderatorum et ma-
"gistrorum assentione tentaturum;"-and particularly, the grant-
ing to the rector, at first, the jurisdiction in all civil and pe-
cuniary questions, respecting members of the University, and
in crimes less atrocious; and afterwards, the extending it to
all causes and crimes whatsoever:-The power, also, of in-
flicting ecclesiastical censure, even that of excommunica-
tion.
