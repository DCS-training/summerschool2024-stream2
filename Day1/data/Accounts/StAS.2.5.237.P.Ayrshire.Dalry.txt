   Divine service is well attended in the parish church, it being in-
conveniently over-crowded, except on some stormy days in winter,
when the country people cannot attend.  There are no societies
for religious purposes in the parish.  The average yearly collect-
tion for the Sabbath Schools amounts to L. 7, 10s.  The only
other extraordinary collections of late years have been for the As-
sembly's India Mission, L. 9, and for building a Gaelic chapel at
Ardrossan, L. 8, 3s.
   Education.--Besides the parochial, there are two private schools
in the town ;  and one in the country part of the parish.  The
usual branches of instruction taught :  in addition to English, writ-
ing and arithmetic, are book-keeping, geography, Latin, Greek,
French, and mathematics.  Those taught in the private schools
are the smae as in the parochial, with the exception of the three
last branches.  The schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, 13s., with L. 2,
2s. 9d. for deficiency of garden ground.  He receives, besides, L. 5
for acting as clerk to the heritors, and as kirk-treasurer.  Taking
into account his perquisites as session-clerk, his salary will average
L. 40 annually.  This, together with the school fees, which will fully
exceed L. 50 yearly, would give a fair remuneration to the teacher.
The school, however, for a number of years, has been taught by an as-
sistant, who receives the fees, while the principal enjoys the salary.
The expense of education is, for English 1s. per month ;  if writing
and arithmetic be included, 1s. 2d. per month ;  and when most of
the other branches are taught, the expense is from 18s. to L. 1, 4s.
per annum.  It is beleived that there are few of the young between
six and fifteen years of age who cannot write, and none of the same
age who cannot read.  There are probably not half a dozen above
fifteen who cannot read ;  but there are a considerable number above
that age who cannot write.  That the people are fully alive to the
benefits of education is evident from the fact, that at the date of
the last Statistical Account, the number of children at school was
90, or one scholar to every twenty-two persons ;  while at pre-
