	About L. 1300 per annum is paid, or is in the hapds of proprie-
tors, small farmers, and feuars.
	The leases are generally for nineteen years, and the farm-stead-

will exhibit the relative state of the country, in respect of prices,
&c. at three different periods--1750, 1791, and 1836.

	The lands towards the Clyde and near gentlemen's houses are
tastefully adorned with plantations. The Cairns planting presents
a number of very fine beeches; and the ravines, through which the
Calder and the Kirk-bum run, are beautifully sprinkled over with
wood of different sorts.
	Manufactures.--The weaving of muslin was introduced about
the year 1783. The work is chiefly derived from  the manufac-
turers in Glasgow. In 1791, there were 120 weavers. They could
easily earn 10s. a week, and the total gross income from this
branch of industry, including the labour of journeyment and appren-
tices, was estimated at L. 2800 per annum. At present, a good
weaver with difficulty earns 10s. per. week, and the general average
is probably not more than 8s. The number of weaver includ-
ing females, who also work at the loom like men, 500. They
will earn about L. 200 per week, or, nearly L 10,000 per annum,
which is at the rate of L. 20 per annum on an average to each
individual. No cotton work now exists in the parish.
