is the opportunity of sea-bathing, which is the purest exer-
cise of health, and perhaps does no less good, than the
credibly large gulps of water, which many in faith of its
healing powers, force themselves to swallow.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The town is well supplied with
butcher meat; and nearly 500 head of black cattle, and 350
calves, besides sheep, lambs, and swine, are slaughtered at the
shambles.  Formerly, fish were plenty, now they are scarce,
and consequently very dear.  The coast being rocky, we
have plenty of crabs and lobsters, which find a ready mar-
ket; but the greatest part of the latter is sent to London;
and it is said, that the fishermen last year drew no less than
80 l. for lobsters sent thither. About the summer markets,
boats loaded with dry fish, such as cod, ling, skate, etc.
