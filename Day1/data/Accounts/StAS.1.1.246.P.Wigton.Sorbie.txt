   Sea Coast, Fish, Tides, etc.-There are upwards of twelve
miles of sea-coast, including the bays.  The shore is rather
bold to the fouth, but becomes flat at Rigg or Hunter's Bay;
and continues so to Garliestown, where it rises again.  On
the whole, it may be called a rocky shore, though in Garlies-
town Bay there is a deep, soft clay, on which vessels lie in the
greatest safety, and have the best anchorage.  Flounders,
soles, skate, cod, crabs, lobsters, oysters, with many other
kinds of fish, abound on the coast.  Herrings were found some
time ago in vast shoals; and there is reason to believe that
they still visit this shore.  Some years ago they were caught
with great success; and it appears from a minute of kirk-
session, dated September 1. 1700, that the inhabitants were
so anxious in the pursuit of them as to be difficulty restrain-
ed from fishing on the Lord's day.  The people are now fully
engaged in agriculture:  Fishing is nearly neglected, and
the fishing boats on the coast are very few.  The sea-animals
are the same with those on the eastern coast of Great Britain.
The sea-weeds are of the common kind.  A few tons of kelp
are made from them every two or three years.  Some are
spread upon the land, without any preparation; but the 
best farmers use them in composts, which produce a quick
and strong fermentation.  The courses of the tides are as
follow.  The tide slows straight out from Wigton Bay six
hours, and takes the same time to return.  At Garliestown,
the tide slows five hours from the south, and ebbs seven.  It
is high water at Garliestown at a quarter of an hour before
eleven o'clock A. M. at the change ad full of the moon.
Ther are no light houses, beacons, or artificial land-marks,
on the coast; but there are several places where light-
houses might be erected with great advantage to navigation.
