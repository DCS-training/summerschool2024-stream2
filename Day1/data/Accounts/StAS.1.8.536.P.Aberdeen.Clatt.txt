     Statistical Account

that the months of September, October and November, have
proved rainy throughout.  The frost mists which sometimes
begin the latter end of July, and are frequent in August and
September, are very injurious to late sown barley, and to
pease*.

   Soil, Cultivation, etc.-The soil is various; light and randy
towards the hill fides; the infield generally a loam, easily cul-
tivated, being neither wet nor too dry.  Were the climate
as favourable as the soil, the ground would produce any sort
of crop common in Scotland; but the frequent changes of
the weather, and the frosts, prove very unfavourable to green
crops; excepting turnips and potatoes, which thrive well,
when the ground is duly prepared.  It must be acknowledged,
that improvements in agriculture and husbandry are, here,
only in their infancy.  Most of the greater farmers, however,
begin to have a few acres in turnips and sown grass; but very
little in fallow, and no wheat, which would be but an uncer-
tain crop, by reason of the lateness of the seasons, the spring
and autumnal frosts, and subsequent rains:  Neither are the
farmers, at present, in a condition to enter into regular rota-
tions; as besides other reasons, their possessions are not of the
proper size, and only upon short leases, which are a certain bar
to all improvements.-Some stone inclosures have been made
of late; and several plantations of wood have been begun up-
on the Knockespock estate.  The first carts were introduced
only in 1760, by the minister and another residenter.  They

*This occasioned the loss of the crop in 1782, by which calamity this coun-
try was much reduced; and had it not been for the Government bounty of meal,
and the seasonable supplies of white pease, destined for the American War, a
famine must have unavoidably ensued:  The peace with America was, therefore,
the providential means of saving several shires in North Britain from depopula-
tion and ruin.
