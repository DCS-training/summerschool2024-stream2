*Reflecting upon the information and pleasure derived from
my intercourse with Mr Cranstoun, I embrance this opportunity
of recommending to young persons, who are inquisitive for
knowledge, to reverence the hoary head, to court the company
and conversation of those whose wisdom has been enriched and
dignified by the experience of multiplied years.  If this advice
were more strictly attended to, interesting anecdotes, and valu-
able information, which elude the notice of general history,
while they are recent and familiar, would often be conveyed by
authentic tradition; and acquiring importance from the rapid and
strange vicissitudes they exhibit, as well as from their contrastand
connection with modern events and manners, would, at length,
enter into record, and be rescued from the gulph of oblivion.
By accumulating a store of facts, our views of past history
would become more correct and enlarged; and speculations
of the philosopher and politician, relative to future events, and
to measures affecting the interests of posterity, would be found-
ed upon the most solid basrs.
   The plan of this statistical history seems well calculated to
supply what has hitherto been a desideratum in literature; and, in
the estimation of future generations, the locality and minuteness
of the circumstances which it contains, will constitute not the
smallest part of its interest and utility- Enlightened by such
instruction, we are enabled to investigate the sources of preju-
dices and customs, the elements of characters and manners, and
the causes of, events, of which, otherwise, we are utterly at a loss
to give any explanation or account.  I illustrate this observa-
tion by a fact strictly pertinent to my present argument.  There
are few, perhaps none in this parish who have heard of the per-
secution of Mr Livingston the minister of Ancrum after the Re-
storation.  He was universally respected in the church for his
piety and for his popular talents as a preacher, and dearly be-
loved by his stock.  He was banished in his old age, because he
could not, in his conscience, conform to Episcopal government,
and keep the King's fasts.   Many of his people shared the same
fate; in that number some boys, because they adhered to
his principles, and were guilty of rudeness to the curate who
was appointed his successor  But, though the story is not re-
membered, the effects of it are still permanent and operative,
and an antipathy to every form and institution supposed to be
derived from Episcopacy, has been instilled with the rudiments
