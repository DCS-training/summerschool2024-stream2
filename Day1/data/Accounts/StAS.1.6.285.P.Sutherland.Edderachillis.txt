monly give 7 s. or 8 s. for an he, and less for a she, goat.
   As for horses, the principal use of them here, is the rearing
of them for sale, there being but little occasion for these ani-
mals in riding or husbandry.  The kind bred here is the Gar-
rons, which are never housed, feed themselves in the mountains
in summer and harvest, and pasture near the houses in
winter and spring.  They are of a good size; and not inferi-

One of them is at Inchard, which never paid any separate

but the fishing does not commence sooner than the middle of
April, either there or on all this coast.  The fishing of this
river, and of others within Lord Reay's estate, is rented by a
company of merchants in Peterhead, who cure and export
