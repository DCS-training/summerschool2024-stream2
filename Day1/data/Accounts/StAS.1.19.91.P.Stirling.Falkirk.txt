   The length of the great canal is 35 miles; the collateral
cut to Glasgow 2 1/4; and that from Port Dundas to the
Monkland Canal, 1 mile; in whole, 38 3/4 miles.  This ex-
tensive track of a canal is supplied with water by six reser-
voirs, which cover about 409 acres of land, and contain
about 12,679 lock-fulls of water; and the Company have
it in their power to increase the number of reservoirs.
   The summit of the canal is 141 feet above the level of
the sea*.  The number of the locks is 20 on the east, and
19 on the west.  The length of the locks between the gates
is 74 feets and the width between the walls 20 feet.  The
medium breadth of the canal at the surface is 56 feet, and
at the bottom 27.  Vessels of 80 or 90 tons, properly
constructed; may be navigated through, and are fit for

<FOOTNOTE>

*The summit of the canaI was at first but 140 feet.  One foot in
height was afterwards added to all the lock-gates, which has made some
people conclude, that as 20 locks are on the east, the summit must now
be 160 feet.  But though the water throughout the canal be one foot
deeper, yet the summit is only raised 12 inches.  The first lock from the
sea does now elevate vessels 8 feet; but the increased height of this 1ock
raises water on the next one foot; thus the upper gate of the 2 d lock,
which was 7 feet above the level of the water on the lower side, is redu-
end to 6 feet, and consequently, when a foot is added to its height, it only,
as formerly, raises the vessel 7 feet.  The same thing happens to the third
lock, and so on through the whole; and when you arrive at the summit,
the boat is only one foot higher than it would have been before the addi-
tion was made to the gates, and this foot was gained at the first lock.
The circumstance of there being 20 locks on the east side of the sum-
mit, and only 19 on the west, may be accounted for as follows:-On the
east; the canal terminates in the Grangeburn, where there is so little
water, that the vessels are left nearly dry at ebb tide; whereas on the
west, it ends in the Clyde where the water is 8 feet deep without the
help of the tide and thus one lock is saved.
The revenue arising from the canal was annually increasing from the
commencement till 1792, when it announced to about L. 14,000.  By the
stagnation of trade in 1793, it did not reach L. 12,000; but in 1794, it
was somewhat more than L. 12,000.
Government have shares in this canal to the extent of L. 50,000.
