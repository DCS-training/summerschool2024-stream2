bushels has been a great quantity of lodged oats, impro-
perly filled, and the straw, so necessary in a cattle coun-
try, fit only for the dunghill.  The lime is 1 s. 2 d. the
Carlisle bushel; and, for some years past, the import has
been nearly the same as in 1790; and only about 1000
bushels of it might annually go to the adjacent parishes.
-The arable farms are all enclosed, and the improvement
of farm houses is going hand in hand with the improve-
ment of land.  So late as 1780, they were, almost with-
out exception, miserable hovels.  Since that time, above
20 have been built, all of them good, and many of them
very good; having not only the farm house, but the of-
fices with slated roofs, and many have been enlarged, re-
paired, and rendered more comfortable habitations for
men.

   Before improvement began, the grain raised in the pa-
rish served the inhabitants.  The effects of the scarce
years, 1782 and 1783, though improvement had then
made small progress, were little felt:  The meal did not
rise above 2 s. the stone.  At that time, the parish could
do little more than supply itself; but in 1790, it export-
ed 400 bolls of oats, 12 Winchester bushels to the boll;
and 400 bolls of meal, 16 stone of 17 1/2 lb. making the
boll.  Wheat and bear cannot be ranked amongst the pre-
sent exports of the parish, but tracts of them are under
cultivation, by different farmers, this season.

   Cattle, Sheep, etc.-The farmers great dependence be-
ing placed upon black cattle, one great object of improve-
ment is, to produce good pasture.  Grain is cheaper here
than in a manufacturing country: the Galloway boll of
oats giving, in this parish, communibus annis, 1 L. 1 s.;
meal, 1 s. 8 d. the stone; and potatoes, 8 d. the bushel.
