     Statistical Account

of victual, thousands might have perished for want.  Very
little of the grain was found fit for feed, and by a survey,
made under the inspection of gentlemen of skill, to ascertain
the real state of the crop, it was found, at an average, to
be sufficient to supply the inhabitants only five months,

religion; maintain, in general, great decorum of behaviour,

excites them, of consequence, to support it.  Nor are
they, in any gradation of society, notorious for any parti-
