     Of Cambusnethan.

14 miles distant from Glasgow, 9 from Lanark, and 4 from
Hamilton, which is the market and post-town, The Clyde.
affords salmon, pike, trout, and parrs.  The Calder is little
more than a rivulet, and is remarkable for the beauty of its
banks.  There is another small stream, which runs across the
higher part of the parish called the Auchter.

   Surface and Soil.-The haughs on the Clyde are extensive
land beautiful.  A considerable part of them forms a lawn in
front of the mansion-house of Cambusnethan; the other part
is regularly enclosed, and well cultivated.  On the bank,
which rises over the haugh-grounds, there are extensive or-
chards; behind these, coppice-woods, or regular plantations,
afford a complete shelter from the easterly winds.  From the
river to the summit of the bank, the average distance is about:
3/4 of an English mile: from this summit, the parish has, upon
the whole, a gentle rise to its farthest point, which must be
of considerable elevation.  The soil is generally clay, with
till bottom; but as the clay is, in some places, much stronger
than in others, or the soil much deeper, there are very differ-
ent degrees of fertility.  In the middle, and higher part of
the parish, the soil is mossy, or mixed with a black sand, pe-
culiarly unfavourable to vegetation.  The soil of the lower
district produces very good grain, and is capable of great im-
provement.

   Agriculture.-Oats are the chief object of attention.  Many
content themselves with raising two or three crops of this
kind, and then lay their fields in grass.  In the care of sum-
mer fallowing (a practice which has not, till of late, been
introduced into this parish), the ploughing is performed
with two horses: however, except in this case, the old
Scotch plough, which cannot be drawn by less than three
