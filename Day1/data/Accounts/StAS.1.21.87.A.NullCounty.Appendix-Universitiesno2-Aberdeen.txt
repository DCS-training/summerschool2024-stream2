gion; scripture criticism; the system of theology; and ec-
clesiastical history; and the pastoral care.

   Oriental Languages.-During the theological session, the
students who attend the hall have also access to lectures in
oriental languages.  No honorarium or fee is paid by the stu-
dents in the theological department.  In the Greek and phi-
losophical departments, the fee paid by the bursars, is from a
guinea to a guinea and a half; the minimum paid by the
free students is at present two guineas.

   Law.-The suppression of the professorship of canon law
has already been noticed: that of civil law still subsists; but
the study of it not being prosecuted in this part of the coun-
try, no lectures have been given for a long time past, in this
branch of science.

   Medicine.-Medicine has hitherto been a branch of educa-
tion which the University have been anxious to promote;
but from different causes, it has not succeeded; chiefly ow-
ing to the detached situation of the College, with other par-
ticular local disadvantages, and there being but one medical
professor in the University.  Several of the incumbents have
made various attempts; and amongst others, the late Dr John
Gregory of Edinburgh, at that time professor of medicine in
King's College, who, with Dr David Skene, physician in A-
berdeen, (an eminent anatomist,) opened a class in the town
of Aberdeen for teaching anatomy, physiology, and the prac-
trice of medicine; but they met with no success, and were oblig-
ed to relinquish the plan.  A similar attempt was made in the
year 1792, by Dr Chalmers, which likewise failed.  And at
present, the several obstacles, which then occurred, still exist.
