     Statistical Account
they can agree for.  At these other schools, there is about
half the number of scholars that attend the parochial
scholls.  Till within 10 years, there was a school in this
parish supported by teh Society for propogating Christian
Knowledge.  In giving a school to a parish, the Society
always appoint the schoolmaster; and they make it a con-
dition, that the parishioners furnish him gratis with a sussi
cient house, garden, grass and fodder for a cow, and as ma-
ny dry pcats as he may require.  The man whom the So-
ciety sent last to this parish, was lame, old and inform, and
being naturally peevish, the parishioners and he could not
be mutually satisfied.  He died in the service.  The So-
ciety did not send a successor; and though the minister of-
fered repeatedly to apply for one, the people would not
content to the burdens required by the Society, having for-
merly found them exceedingly troublesome.  As the So-
ciety now have a handsome fund, it is to be hoped they
will be more libera.-  The average number of poor in the
parish is 20.  Each of them get from 10 s. to 15 s. at an
annual distribution of the funds.  The poor consist of el-
derly persons, who, unable to earn a subsistence, go about
and get alms from the inhabitans,  If any of them are
disable from travelling about, there is a meeting of the
heritors and session called, and such of the parishioners as
choose to attend, in order to assest the parish for their sup-
port.  Every plough of land pays a certain quantity of
meal, and this is sent to the poor person's place of abode;
besides, such a sum of money is sent out of the funds, as is
thought sufficeint to purchase any necessary of clothing or
medicine.  The fund at present is about L. 120 Sterling,
which has been made up partly by donations, and partly 
by savings in plentiful years.  The collections at the
church-doors amount annually to about L.14 Sterling.
Many plans have been concerted by te Commissioners
