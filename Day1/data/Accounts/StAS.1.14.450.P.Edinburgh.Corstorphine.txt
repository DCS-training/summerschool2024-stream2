direct travellers going from Edinburgh, along a road
which, in those times, was both difficult and dangerous.
   There is in this parish another place of worship, but
which appears never to have been used for that purpose
since the time of the Reformation.  It is a small chapel
at Gogar, which is now annexed to Corstorphine:  there
is a burying-ground around it, and which is stil used for
this purpose.  There are also a few acres of ground as a
glebe, which belongs to the minister of Corstorphine, and
which, some years ago, was let in feu by the presbytery
of Edinburgh to the proprietor of the estate of Gogar.
   There is a school still supported in the village of Go-
gar.  Besides the emolument of class-fees, the schoolmas-
ter is in use to receive some benefaction from the pro-
prietor of the place.

   Population, &c.-According to Dr. Webster's report,
the population in 1755 was 995.  The present number of 
souls is 1037:  of males, 484; of females, 553; at 8
years of age, and under, there are 228; of families, there
are 250; which makes only 4 1/5 to a family.  The num-
ber of farms is about 17; and none of them of immo-
derate extent.  The practice of engrossing small farms
seems not to have been practised in a degree any way
prejudicial in this parish.  The greatest part of it is di-
vided between 3 heritors:  Besides these, there are about
14 smaller heritors and feuars.  There are no manufac-
turers in this parish.  The numbers employed in the com-
mon occupation of tradesmen, are as under:
