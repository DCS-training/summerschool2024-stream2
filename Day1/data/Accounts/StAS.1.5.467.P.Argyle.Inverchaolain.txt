bourhood, are so sensible of his superior mode of cultiva-
tion, that they have, (with great advantage to themselves),
adopted it on a small scale; and it is hoped, due time,
his example will have more general influence over all this
country.-There are 40 ploughs in the parish.  Some
plow with 2, some with 3, and some with 4 horses.  The 
average produce of oats, on ground cultivated on the old
plan, is from 3 to 4 bolls per acre; of bear from 4 to 5.-
The prices of all our productions, are regulated by the 
Greenock market.  The produce in grain being short of 
the consumption, an annual importation, of about 400 bolls
of oat-meal, is necessary.  Some poultry, butter and cheese
are exported.

   Sheep.-Our mountains, which were of old pastured
with black cattle and horses, are now covered with sheep,
which has not only made a pleasant change on the surface,
but has also encreased the rents considerably, and enables
the graziers to live better, and  make money.  There may
be about 14,000 sheep in the parish; the Crawford muir
black-faced sheep, are the kind that are thought to suit
best; but many of the graziers here, are liberal minded
gentlemen, fond of making experiments, and of im-
proving their breed of sheep.  Some of the Cheviot, or
long-faced white sheep, have lately been brought to this
parish.   Some of them are pastured in our mountains, and 
others on our low ground.  Those on the mountains seem
to thrive equally well with those in the low lands, which
is a proof of their hardiness and fitness for the climate.
Tbe prices of sheep and wool have encreased of late;
three-year-old wedders are sold at from 10 s. to 14 s.;
ewes, (commonly called old or draught ewes), from 6 s.
to 8 s.; lambs, from 3 s. to 5 s.; wool laid with tar, from
5 s. to 6 s. a stone, (Trone weight, 24 English ounces to
