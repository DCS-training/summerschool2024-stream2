the Associate Synod of Originat Seceders, which it is much to be
desired that the way might be opened for receiving back into the
Establishment.
   The other places of worship in Aberdeen are as follows:-3 cha-
pels belonging to the Congregatioiial Union; 3 chapels connected
with the United Associate Synod; 1 chapel in connection with the
Relief body; 2 chapels belonging, the one to the Scotch and the
other to the English Baptists; 1 chapel belonging to the Wesleyan
Methodists; 1 English Episcopal chapel, with two clergymen; 1
Scotch Episcopal chapel, with a bishop and a curate ; 1 Roman
Catholic chapel; 1 chapel which is called the United Christian
Church.
   In addition to all these, there are also in Aberdeen small num-
bers of Friends, Glassites, Irvingites, and Unitarians, which have
each their own place of worship.
   The following table gives a summary view of the ecclesiastical
state of the inhabitants of Aberdeen, as ascertained by surveys
made chiefly by the elders of the respective parishes, and given
in to the Royal Commissioners for Religious Instruction, when they
visited this city in October 1837. *

   There is too much reason to fear, that, although the surveys on
which this table is founded were made with every possible care,
there are many included under the heads both of the Establish-
ment and Dissenters who are little, if at all, in the habit of fre-
quenting any place of worship.  And it must be remembered, too
that the strongest attachment to the forms of a professing church
is unhappily too often found to be compatible with an utter disre-
gard or even a deliberate rejection of the saving thruths of the Gos-
pel.

<FOOTNOTE>In this table, under the head of Dissenters, see included both these denomina-
tion that are friendly and that are adverse to the principle of a national
church.
