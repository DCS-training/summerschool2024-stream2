education of 4 poor children, may amount to 25 L. Ster-
ling a-year.  The number of scholars, at an average, will
be about 50.  Two private schools are likewise generally
kept, for the winter months, in different parts of the pa-
rish, and the number of scholars at each about 30.-The
poor are not numerous, and seldom beg.  The funds
for their maintenance are the weekly collections at church,
which some years fall under, but seldom exceed, 15 L.

smallest in circumference, is of a sharp conical figure, and
a small space at the top has been surrounded with a stone

the dead; for in all of them that have ben opened, there
has been found, it is said, an urn, enclosed in stones, in
the form of an oblong square, about the middle of the

bottom of another up.  In each, there was a small quan-
