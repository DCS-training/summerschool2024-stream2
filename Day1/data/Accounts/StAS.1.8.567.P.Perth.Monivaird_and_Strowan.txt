     of Monivaird and Strowan.

     NUMBER XXXVI.

     UNITED PARISHES OF MONIVAIRD AND
     STROWAN.

     (County of Perth Presbytery of Auchterarder-Synod of
     Perth and Stirling.)

     By the Rev. Mr. COLIN BAXTER.  Minister of these united
     Parishes.

     Origin of the Names.

   MONIVAIRD and STROWAN, originally distinct parishes,
have been united for at least a century and a half.  The
modern name, Monivaird, is a corruption of the ancient, which
was Moivard, as appears by a grant made by the Earl of
Stratherne, in the beginning of the 13th century, of the church
of St. Servanus, or Serph of Moivard, to the monastery of
Inchaffery.  The ancient name is full retained, in the speech
of a few inhabitants of the parish, who use corrupted dialect
of the original language of Scotland.  The origin of the name
cannot easily be traced, its etymology is Gaelic; being made
up of two words, Moi Vard, signifying the Plain of Bards.
Strowan is probably a corruption of St. Ronan, the tutelar
saint of Strowan parish.
