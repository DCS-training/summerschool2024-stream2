But a missionary is now established in each of these stations,
with a salary of 50 L.  Sterling, arising chiefly from funds
mortified by the late Lady Glenorchay, and left under the
management of the Society for Propagating Christian Know-
ledge, together with a manse and glebe from the Earl of
Breadalbane.  The mission at Strathfillan, in the west end
of the parish, comprehends also the adjacent parts of the
parish of Glenorchay; and that at Ardeonaig to the eastward
takes in the neighbouring parts of the parishes of Kenmore
and Weem.  The legal stipend of Killin is 55 L. 11 s. 1 1/2 d.
Sterling, with a manse, office-houses, and glebe.  The heri-
tors give besides 35 L. 18 s. 8 d. Sterling of a gratuitous do-

the living since the Revolution.  Excepting one family of
Roman Catholics, there are no sectaries of any denomination
in the parish.
