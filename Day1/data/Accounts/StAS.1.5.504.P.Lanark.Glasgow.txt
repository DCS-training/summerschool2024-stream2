     Statistical Account

that it nearly rivals some of the finest works of that kind
in Staffordshire.  All the courser kinds of pottery, together
with bricks, tiles, etc. are also made here in great abundance.
A very considerable quantity of hats are likewise manufac-
tured, not only for home sale, but for exportation to America
and the West Indies, together with nun's thread, silk, cotton
and worsted stockings, and gloves of all kinds.  During the
time of the American trade, large quantities of tobacco
were manufactured into snuff, etc. and immense quantities
of shoes and saddles made and exported to that country, for
which purpose very extensive works were erected for
tanning leather.  These manufactures still continue, though
perhaps not to the extent that they did at that time.
   The manufactures of ropes and cordage of all kinds,
the making of soap and candle, and the refining of sugar,
which appear to have been the first that were begun here,
are still carried on to a great extent, though they have lost
the privileges, granted for their encouragement before the
Union.  The art of type founding, has been long prac-
tised here, and, (together with that of printing by Mr
Saunders, Mr Urie, and the Meffrs Foulis), has been brought
to as great perfection, as in any part of the world.  The
introduction of the cotton manufacture, and those trades
depending on it, has given rise to many new manufactures,
and to the making machinery of all kinds, which, toge-
ther with all kinds of work, in cast or malleable iron, and
in brass and lead, are now made here in great quantities.
The manufacture of bottles, or green glass, has been long
established here, and is now considerably increased; and
has of late been extended to slint glass, in which they have
come to great perfection.
   About the year 1760, a very extensive brewery was
erected near Anderson, from which large quantities of
ale and porter were exported to Ireland and to America.
