        From the house down to a small stream flowing past it, there are the
        remains of a covered way, as if indicating, from the means em-
        ployed to reach the water in safety, that in these troublous times
        it was occasionally converted into a place of defence. All that
        now remains is apparently a small part of a turret or corner of the
        building. Several stone coffins have, from time to time, been found
        in different parts of the parish; but there seems to have been
        nothing about them worthy of notice.
                                   III.-POPULATION.

           The population of the parish, according to Dr Webster's account
                                     in 1755,  was 535
                                        1792,      526
                                        1801,      538
                                        1811,      540
                                        1821,      704
                                        1831,      617
                                        1833,      664
        The last census was taken by the present incumbent,  and in-
        cluded 324 males and 340 females.
           From the above it will appear that there is a considerable de-
        crease in the population between 1821 and 1831. This may be
        accounted for from the circumstance, that, at the first of these pe-
        riods, very considerable improvements were going on at Blairhill
        and Batruddery, which required an additional number of labourers;
        and, moreover, a distillery in the parish was then in active opera-
        tion, which has now been given up.                     -

        The number of the population residing in villages in the parish, in 1833, was   210
