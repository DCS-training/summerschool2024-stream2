and larch, and fourteen of ash, birch, oak, elm, and beech. There
are few or no enclosures, but the state of the farm-buildings and
dwelling-houses is improved of late years. As the farms are small,
and the tenants industrious, improvements, encouraged by the
landlord, during the last seventeen years have made rapid progress,
-much aided, no doubt, by the facility with which lime is pro.-
cured from Mortlach, in consequence of the building of Craig
Elachie bridge, and the improved state of the roads. The returns
on the best land are six to eight; and on the poorer soils four to
five. The weight of hay from sown grasses from 100 to 150 stones,
per acre.
   On the estate of Kirdals there are 572 acres either cultivated or
occasionally in tillage; 132 waste or in pasture ; 4500 in a state of
undivided common; and 400 in wood, consisting of fir, oak, birch,
and alder. There are few enclosures; and, with some exceptions,
the farm-buildings are rather of an inferior kind. The greatest
obstacles to improvement arise from want of capital, and more ex-
tensive meliorations. The number of horses amounts to 44; of
black cattle to 330; and of sheep to 200. Average gross amount
of raw produce raised on the estate: turnips, 30 acres; grain,1200
bolls; potatoes, 400 bolls; hay, 3000 stones.
   On the estates of Wester Elchies and Ballintomb there are
about 1170 acres in cultivation, 100 in meadow pasture, and 3400
in hill and moss, 60 for occasional tillage and 86 for permanent
pasture, 200 in natural wood of oak, birch, alder, &c., and 80 in
plantations of, Scotch, larch, spruce, and silver firs. The want
of capital is the chief obstacle to improvement; and although
the proprietor allows L.5 for every improved acre at the end of
the lease, few tenants can conveniently want their money so long,
chiefly on account of an advance of' ten per cent. on the tenth
rent, and five per cent. on the fifteenth rent, which per cen-
tages continue to the expiry of the nineteen years' lease. There
are but few enclosures, and the farm-buildings are generally but
indifferent. Stone enclosures are-paid by mutual valuation at the
conclusion of the lease. There are about 50 pigs, 90 horses, 800
black-cattle, and a few sheep. The average gross amount of pro-
duce may be about 50 quarters of, wheat; 200 of barley; 45 of
pease; 1940 of oats; 350 bolls of potatoes; 25 stones of flax;
and 150 to 200 of hay per, acre.
   No proper return can at present be given, for the estate of
Knockando.
