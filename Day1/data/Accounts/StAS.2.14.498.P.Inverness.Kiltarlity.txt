yards from the public road, which here serves as the boundary be-
tween the two estates ; but the numerous trees in the surround-
ing pleasure-grounds are so disposed, that the passing traveller
can hardly catch a glimpse of it. The house is quite a modern
one, and is furnished in a most splendid manner. It was built at a
very considerable expense by the late proprietor, James Fraser,
Esq., who also erected in the neigbbourhood a farm-steading
of corresponding magnificence. The property was . purchased
by John Stewart, Esq. of Carnousie, for the sum of L. 80,000.
For a great many years past, much care has been observed in lay-
Ing out the grounds and woods in the neighbourhood. The gar-
dens, orchards, and shrubberies, together with the hot-houses and
green-houses, are admirably kept, and evidences of a superior
taste are every where discernible. A great part of the property is
covered with valuable timber, consisting principally of Scotch fir
and larch. The portions already disposed of and cut down have
yielded a handsome sum to the present owner, who pays much at-
tention to the thinning and proper management of his forests; and
by his directions, the blanks caused by the cutting are in the
course of being planted with timber of a different sort from that
which formerly grew on the same soil. The rental of the Bel-
ladrurn esta ' te is supposed to be about L. 1600; and a considera-
ble part of it is considered to be improvable. The most of it,
however, consists of hilly pasture ground, abounding in various
sorts of game, as roe, bare, black-game, grouse, partridge, &e.
The lakes and marshes on the property, though not much worth
for the angling to be got on them, are resorted to by various kinds
of water-fowl. The number of acres on this estate is 4300, be-
i ng composed of about 700 acres of arable, 2600 acres of pasture,
and about 1000 acres under wood. Mr Stewart and his family ge-
nerally reside for some months in the year at Belladru ' m, where
their warm and active benevolence command the esteem and re-
spect of all around them.
