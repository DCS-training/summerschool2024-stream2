lage, two thirds of which may be sown with oats, and the
remainder with bear, barley, potatoes, and a few acres in
turnip.  The principal manure used for improving land is
sea shells, of which there is an almost inexhaustable quanti-
ty, not only within the high water mark on this side of Wig-
ton bay, but also in the dry land, several hundred yards
from the shore, particularly in the holms of Cassencarie, the
property of Alexander Muir M'Kenzie Esq; where they are
in beds from four to ten feet deep of the finest shells ima-
ginable, without almost any mixture of sand.  As there can-
not remain a doubt but that these shells have been thrown
together and left there by the tide, so from these and other
fossile marine productions, found both on this and the other
side of the bay, it is evident, that the tide has flowed 15 or
16 feet higher on this coast, at that period, than it doth at
the present.  These shells are generally sold by the agents of
Mr M'Kenzie at 5 d per tun, 25 tuns of which is sufficient
for an acre of land, and proves a cheap and excellent ma-
nure to this part of the country, and is considered much
preferable to either lime or marle.  But the advantages of
this valuable treasure of shells is not confined to this part of
the country alone, but extends round 50 or 60 miles of a
coast as far as the mull of Galloway, where they are sold as
high as 3 s. 6 d. per tun.  Many thousand tuns of these shells
are carried off annually, by a number of vessels, from 20 to
60 tuns burthen, which are constantly employed when the
weather will permit, in carrying them all round the coast,
and some times even to the Isle of Man.  These shells have
been used with great advantage for the improvement of bar-
ren heathy land, in so much, that many hundreds of acres
in this parish, originally not worth more than 2 s. per acre,
have been made worth from 10 s. to 15 s. per acre.  Yet
this, like every other advantage that is easily attained, is not
