character is grander or more picturesque, and there are points
from which the eye may wander over a much wider tract of hill
and d`le, and of mountain and wild; but there are few spots of
such moderate elevation, from which you can look down on a richer
and more beautiful scene than from the battlements of Castle
Huntly.  The prospect, with which no stranger can fail to be de-
lighted, comprises the whole of the Carse nf Gowrie, studded as
it is with gentlemen's seats, and waving with the most luxuriant
crops of grain,-the river Tay, from Newburgh to within a few
miles of its confluence with the German Ocean,-the opposite
coast of Fife, where the east and west Lomonds in particular are
very prominent objects,-part of Strathearn, with the Ochils and
other loftier mountains in the distance,-the braes of the Carse,
as they are called, cultivated to their very summits, and over them
the higher range of the Sidlaws, by which it is separated from
Strathmore.

                         III.-POPULATION.
              In 1755, the population amounted to     1285
                 1795,                                1526
                 1801,                                1569
                 1811,                                1809
                 1821,                                1544
                 1831,                                1638

  The population of 1811 exceeded that of 1801 by 240; and
the population of 1821 came short of that of 1811 by 265.  The
difference is to be accounted for chiefly by the great demand for
stones from, Kingoody, prior to 1811, which induced a number of
labourers to settle there, so that the village contained 53 families.
That demand afterwards fell off, and, in consequence, the ddcrease
of inhabitants in Kingoody alone amounted in 1821 to not less
than 134.  The population in the country parts of the parish has,
upon the whole, rather diminished since that period; but this di-
minution is more than balanced by an additional village which has
been recently erected on the estate of Mylnefield, and in which
nearly 40 families now reside, the majority of them finding em-
ployment at a bleachfield, which was established a few years ago
in their immediate neighbourhood, though not within the bounds
of this parish.
