is as 1 to 4.  Of the 36 births annually, there occur in ge-
neral three instances of children still-born, and one instance
of twins.
   The inhabitants are not liable to any particular local di-
stemper, and many of them arrive at a very advanced age.
One died a few years ago aged upwards of 100, and a friendly
company occasionally met, which was styled the Eighty-four
Club, where no member was admitted till they attained the
number of years mentioned in the title.  In proof of the situa-
tion of Dunkeld being healthful, it may be mentioned, that
it is frequently recommended by physicians as a summer
residence for their consumptive patients.  The oftensible
reason of such recommendation, is, no doubt, the opportu-
nity of obtaining goat-whey*, which it affords.  But it is at
the same time understood, that the purity of the air coming
cleared and freshened from the hills of the Highlands, toge-
ther with the comforts of the society, and the charms of the
scenery, (inducing the invalid to regular and gentle exer-
cise), form not the least powerful and beneficial medicines.
