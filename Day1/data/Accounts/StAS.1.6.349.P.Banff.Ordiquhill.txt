   Names of Places, Mineral Springs, etc.-The names of pla-
ces in this parish seem mostly of Gaelic original.-There
are several excellent mineral wells in the parish; which were
formerly much frequented.  They are of a medicinal quality,
and are known to be useful in many complaints, particularly
those of a scorbutic nature.  One of them, being dedicated to
the Virgin Mary, was formerly at certain seasons much resort-

salubrious, and the people healthy, hospitable and industrious.

   Produce and Rent.-About two thirds of the parish are arable;
the other is still in a state of nature, and partly covered with
heath.  The soil is, in general, deep; but cold and wet at the
bottom.  A considerable quantity of lint, turnips and potatoes
are raised here; but hemp, cabbages, and the like, however,
are seldom produced in the fields.  Though there are 3 or 4
farms of about 100 acres arable, besides a considerable extent
of pasture, the highest rent, every thing included, does not
exceed L. 40 sterling yearly.  The valued rent of the parish is
L. 1700 Scots; the real rent at present, including servitudes,
amounts to about L. 700 sterling.

who generally resides in the parish, is sole proprietor; and his
house, which is lately fitted up in the modern taste, is com-
modious and elegant; and surrounded by a number of vener-
able ash, and other trees, in a thriving way.  He is spread-
