   Roads, Surface, &c.-The great turnpike road from
Edinburgh, by Hawick, Langholm, and Carlisle, to Lon-
don runs along the banks of the Ewes, and gives it an
air of improvement which it did not before possess.  This
road was, according to my information, planned by Mr.
Pultency, and carried into execution in the year 1765, by
an act of parliament, obtained for that purpose.  There
are 2 other publick roads, the one leading to the E., and
opening a communication into that division of the county
of Roxburgh called Liddlesdale; the other opening up the 
communication to Dumfries and Moffat.  Both these roads
were made by act of parliament, laying on so much year-
ly upon the lands of the different heritors, according to
their valued rent, and which the tenants are obliged to
pay lieu of the ordinary statute-labour.  The country
is very agreeable; the hills, on both sides of the water,
being entirely green, except some small spots of health,
fringed with plantations, which thrive well, and bid fair
to pay amply for the land occupied by them; and if his
Grace the Duke of Buccleugh should continue to plant,
it will become, perhaps, the most pleasant highland coun-
try in the S. of Scotland.  Even in its present situation,
the views are many of them striking and picturesque from
the different aspects, which at almost every turn of the 
road, the country assumes.

   Antiquities.-Though next to a border parish, there is
not, as far as I can find, after the most minute inquiry,
one single antiquity worth the taking notice of, except one
small station, which appears to me to be either Saxon or
Pictish, from its form.
 
   Heritors, Rent, Stock, &c.-There are no residing heri-
