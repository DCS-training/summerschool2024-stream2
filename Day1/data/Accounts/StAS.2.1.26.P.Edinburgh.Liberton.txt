parish school can never instruct one-sixth of the children in a pa-
rish like this.  There should be a well endowed school for every
500 of the population.  For this purpose, all our district schools
should be raised to the rank of parish schools and suitably endow-
ed. The status and character of all teachers, even those at pre-
sent called Parochial, should as much as possible be raised, by a
liberal provision for their maintenance (which at present is often
not so great as that of a collier or mason), and the fees should be
as much as possible lowered.  A most marked improvement has
already followed even the imperfect efforts made in this parish for
the improvement of education.
   Literature.--There have been for several years libraries in Li-
berton and Gilmerton.  The one in Gilmerton was chiefly esta-
blished by the late Rev.  Mr Grant and Dr Stevenson, and is now
valuable, containing a great many excellent books.  The Liberton
library is also good, and is managed by a committee of the sub-
scribers.  A new library was lately established at Liberton Church
in connexion with the Sabbath School, which meets in the church
before public worship.  It contains already 150 volumes which are
eagerly read by the children, who amount to about 100, under eight
or nine teachers.  A similar library has been established in con-
nexion with the Sabbath school at Gilmerton.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons
receiving aid from the kirk-session was, in 1835, 129; in 1836, 120;
in 1837, 110; so that the number is gradually diminishing.  The
sum given to each varies from L. 7, 16s. to L. 1, 6s. per annum.
The auto expended on ordinary paupers was, in 1837, L. 309, 9s.
1d.; in 1836, L. 348, 1s.; in 1835, L 391, 18s. 10d.  Besides
this, other sums were expended, amongst which from L. 3 to L. 5
were given each year in the form of occasional relief to per-
sons not upon the poor's roll;: L. 7, 18s.  1d. was applied to the
education of seventeen poor children; and in 1836, L. 29, 4s.;
in 1837, L. 36, 19s. 4d. raised by voluntary contribution, was
devoted to the purchase of coals for the poor during the unusual
severity of winter. The poor of this parish are partly supported
by voluntary contributions, partly by assessments. The first as-
sessment was made in 1779. Before that the average collections
at the church doors was L. 42, 1Os. 9 1/2d. At present the average
is great,being L. 55, Os. 8d. The amount of assessment was in
1835, L. 399, 8s. 4 1/2d.; in 1836, L. 497, 5s. 9 1/2d. ; in 1837,
L. 350, 0s. 11d. For the same years the collections were, 1835,
