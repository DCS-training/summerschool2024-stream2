in that period.  But, so far as the population of the parish is
to be judged of from the session records, it may be concluded,
that it has increased in the lower parts thereof, and particu-
larly in the village of Killin, with the district of country
that surrounds it, nearly in the same proportion in which it
has decreased in the higher parts.  The register of births in
the parish has been kept with much exactness during the
period specified from which it appears, that the total num-
ber of births in the parish for 60 years, preceding the year
1790, amounts to 6916, at the annual average of 115, with
little difference.  An abstract of the births and marriages in
the parish, for 10 years preceding the year 1790, is subjoined.
Owing to the number of places of interment no register of
deaths has been ever kept in the parish.
