     Statistical Account

   Climate.-This parish, as it faces the Atlantic Ocean, is
much exposed to the westerly winds, and the rains which
generally accompany them.  The climate may be said to
be moist, or even wet, but not very cold, on account of
the vicinity of the sea.-The people are generally heal-
thy, and subject to few diseases.  The prejudice against in-
oculation for the small-pox is now done away; and that
disease, formerly so fatal to children, very seldom proves
mortal; of 100 children inoculated last year not one died.

   Antiquities.-The antiquities of the parish consist of a
number of Danish forts, some rude obelisks, and the re-
mains of one vitrified tower.  One of the obelisks (which
stands on an eminence, to which it must have been carried
from some considerable distance) measures 16 feet above
ground, and is 4 feet broad, by 2 1/2 feet thick; a curious mo-
nument of the knowledge which our forefathers must have
had of the mechanic powers.

   Church, Stipend, etc.-Extensive as this parish still is, it
was much more so before the late incumbent, Mr Robert
Thomson, after much trouble and expence, got a part of it
disjoined, and formed into a new erection, together with a
part of the neighbouring parish of Kilcalmonell.  In this
laudable undertaking his merit was the greater, as his li-
ving at the time was only L. 50 a-year, with which he had
to support and educate a numerous family.  But he was a
man who made little account of his private interest when
engaged in any scheme for the public good.  He afterwards
got his living augmented to what is at present enjoyed by
the writer of this, namely, 6 chalders of bear, Kintyre mea-
sure, and L. 18, 10 s. Sterling money, together with a glebe,
and L. 12, 10 s. in lieu of manse.  The Duke of Argyle is
patron of the parish.
