The glebe consists of 7 Scots acres.  The manse was built

There are two schools in this parish; one of them is a paro-
chial school, the other is planted by the Society for pro-
pagating Christian Knowledge.  The emoluments of the
parochial school are 200 merks Scots of salary, one shilling
the quarter for every scholar taught to read; one shil-
ling and sixpence the quarter from every scholar taught
writing, arithmetic, and Latin.  The Society schoolmaster
has a salary of L. 12. the children of the poor are taught by
him gratis.  At each of these shcools there are from 60 to
80 children.  The number of poor on the parish roll is 50.
The fund to provide for them is not above L. 10, arising
from the weekly collectiones, the hire of a mortcloth,
and the interest of L. 50 due the session by bond.  The
greater number of those on the roll can provide for them-
selves in part, by their labour.  Few if any on the poors
roll beg from door to door, yet the parish is insested with
beggars from other places.
