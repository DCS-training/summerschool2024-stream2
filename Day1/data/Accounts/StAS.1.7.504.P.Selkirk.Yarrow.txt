males.  What the ancient population was, cannot now be
well ascertained, as all the old records were burnt about 30
years ago along with the manse.  The aged people all agree
in asserting, that it considerably exceeded the present; and
their testimony is corroborated from the numerous remains
of old houses.  Various causes may be assigned for this de-
population.  One, undoubtedly, may be imputed to the mo-
nopoly of farms, which diminishes the number of farmers
families.  Another may be attributed to the aversion of the
farmers to rebuild cot-houses, which decreases the class of
cottagers.  A third may be ascribed to the manufactures car-
ried on in other parts of the country, which draw off the in-
habitants from such parishes as this, where they have not as
yet found their way.

   Longevity.-In this parish, scarcely any person ever attains
to 100 years.  There is, however, one instance of this re-
membered.  A woman died here several years ago at the
great age of 106.  At present, there are several persons bor-
dering upon 90, but none exceed it.
