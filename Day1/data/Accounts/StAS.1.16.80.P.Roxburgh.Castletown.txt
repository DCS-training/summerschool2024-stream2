   Eminent Men.-This parish gave birth to the celebrated
Dr ARMSTRONG, whose father and brother were ministers
of it.

   Antiquities.-There are several monuments of great an-
tiquity in the parish, but their origin and their history are
involved in much obscurity.  Even tradition itself says
little concerning them.  There are also several old gold
coins in the possession of Mr Elliot of Red-heugh*.  Though
this parish comprehended a great part of the middle march
between the two kingdoms, yet excepting a few detached
facts, there is nothing of consequence preserved or related
by historians.  As it lies directly along the English Border,
it must have been, for a long period, the scene of action, of
fierce contentions, barbarous feuds, and marauding expedi-
tions, which took place between the two nations, when,
before the union, and before law and civilization took
place, inroads were constantly made by both parties upon
each other, and the stronger arm carried away every thing
both from the house and from the field.  These exploits
have been recorded in the poetry of the times, which are
still sung by the aged, and listened to with eagerness by
the young.  They contain an account of the heroic at-
chievements of those days, that is to say, of the inroads
made and repelled by the marauders on each side of the
Border+.

*They were found on the farm of Priest-heugh, in the neighbourhood
of this parish.  Some years ago a box was found in the side moss, con-
taining about 120 silver coins, about the value of 3 d each, variously in-
scribed.  Some of them were clipped, or cut in the edges, and not coined.
Some copper or brass vessels, of antique forms, were found in a moss on
Shortbuttrees and sent to the Duke of Buccleugh.
