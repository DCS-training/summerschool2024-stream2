        large surface of fertile land, now covered with water, might be
        brought into cultivation, to the great benefit of the proprietor.
          The obstacles to improvement are, want of capital, want of
        roads to the moorland, and want of drains and inclosures.
          The sand, which consists of about three parts of lime and one
        of silex, is found to answer well as manure, when laid on moss, by
        which crops of bear and oats are produced; so,that if goud roads
        were made through the different farms, from the shore to the
        moss, extending at an average for three or four miles large tracts
        of moorland, with the aid of sea-ware and sand, might be brought
        into cultivation, particularly as the small tenants are beginning to
        use carts in husbandry, and as the quantity of sea-weed cast on
        the west shore is very great.

          The quantity of rye raised is but small, and confined to four
        or five farms.  There are only four or five gardens in the parish.
        There are scarcely any cabbages raised by the small tenants, or
        any garden vegetable, or roots.  The egg trade is carried on by
        young able-bodied men, who go about through the country with
        baskets, buying up all the eggs they can got at 3d. per dozen.
        These are shipped off for Glasgow and Greenock from Loch
        Boisdale, Loch Eynort, and the Sound of Eriscay, in open boats,
        of from 17 to 20 feet keel; in return for which, the dealers bring
        home goods, such as dye-stuffs, tobacco, cotton goods, crockery,
        and some other articles of convenience.
           It was only a. few years ago that turnips were introduced They
        are only cultivated on two or three farms.  They answer uncom-
        monly well ; and I cannot doubt, that when Enclosure became
        general, they will be extensively cultivated.  Artificial grasses
        such as rye-grass and clover, are only raised on two farms, where
        they are found to thrive welI. The want Of inclosures is the great
