ders and dyers, and to private families for oulinary purposes.  It
may here be mentioned, that the first potatoes produced in Scot-
land were at this place, from seed brought over by Mr Christie
from Ireland.
   There are three iron founderies of considerable extent.  Their
work in cast-iron machinery and blacksmith's articles is well exe-
cuted, and has an extensive sale.
   Navigation.--The direct importation from foreign parts into
Perth for the year 1835, consisted chiefly of Baltic produce, and
of the following articles: cheese, 840 cwt.; clover seed, 780 cwt.;
foreign spirits, 120 gal.; flax, 2000 cwt; lintseed, 50 quarters (the
importations of this article generally consist of from 600 to 800
quarters yearly;) and a considerable quantity of timber,--pine, Nor-
way, Baltic, and American, the whole imported in twenty-two ves-
sels, the sales whereon were L.5191.  Besides the above, there
were corns, bark, hides, smalt, madder, tar, &c. Importations of
bones and animalized carbon, to a considerable extent, have taken,
place, not only from the continent, but coastways, which have been
found (the bones being ground) to be very beneficial in raising
turnips.
   The articles imported coastways are, coal, lime, salt, manure,
&c. The quantity of coals in 1835 was, from England, about
22,000 tons; and from Scotland, about 11,500 tons.  The value
about L.28,500.
   The exports to foreign parts were trifling. Indeed, from the con-
tiguity of the great shipping port of Dundee, a great many articles
were sent thither in lighters for exportation, and a number of car-
goes, ostensibly for Perth and its county, were entered inwards
there from the continent, and transhipped into lhghters hither.  But
the quantity of potatoes shipped from Perth for the London mar-
ket during the last year was 27, 114 tons, or I08,456 Scotch bolls.
The value in Perth about L.65,000; and the value in London,
which includes freight, &c. about L,101,000.  The other exports
consisted of corns of all kinds, about 40,000 quarters, and a con-
siderable quantity of timber, slates, &c.
   The number of vessels belonging to Perth is 78,--5467 tons.
   The number of coasting-vessels which entered the port last year
was 736,--about 40,000 tons.
   The only navigable river connected with the parish is the Tay,
