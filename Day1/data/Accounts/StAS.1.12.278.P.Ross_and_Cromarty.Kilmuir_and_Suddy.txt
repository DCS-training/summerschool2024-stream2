indolence of the present inhabitants, and I am well convinced,
if gentlemen farmers, possessed of capitals, came to settle in 
this place, they would meet with all due encouragement, both
as to leases and melioration, from the proprietors, who all
wish to encourage agriculture; and I am persuaded, that such
adventurers would find, upon trial, that it would turn out to
their own private advantage.
