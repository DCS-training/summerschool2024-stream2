     Origin of the Name.

   INVERARAY, in Gaelic, Ion-ar-ao-reidh, is the modern
name of the parish.  The appellations by which it was
formerly distinguished, viz. Kilmilieu and Glenaray, were
either given in consequence of its being the cell of some
monk, or from a glen which forms a considerable part of
the district.  In the Highlands of Scotland, although the
names of rivers are sometimes descriptive of their appear-
ance, yet this, in many instances, may be justly called the
region of conjecture.  The river which runs by Invera-
ray, in Gaelic, Ao-reidth, is a contraction of Ao, a priva-
tive (not,) and Reidh, smooth.  This etymology suits
with the appearance of some parts of the river at this
day, and was very applicable to the whole of it, before its
channel was cleared.  Ao-reidh, is evidently contrasted
with Sio-reidh, always smooth, the name of another river
