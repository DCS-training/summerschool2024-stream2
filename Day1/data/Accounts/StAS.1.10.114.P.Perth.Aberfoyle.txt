mountainous districts to the N. and to the W.  This parish
consists of a narrow track of country, bounded on every side
by lofty hills and mountains.  The bottom of the valley is
occupied by a series of beautiful lakes, skirted with woods
of oak, ash, and birch; and their banks are occasionally di-
versified with scanty portions of cultivated ground, the soil
of which has, in the course of ages, been washed down from
the mountains, and deposited by the streams.
   The mountains are sometimes covered with oak woods
more than half way up.  The lower eminences are, for the
most part, covered to their summits.  The higher regions
are chiefly overgrown with heath; and sometimes they pre-
sent only the bare rugged rock.
   The most considerable lakes are Loch Ketterin, Loch Con,
and Loch Ard.  The former is about eight miles in length,
and one in breadth.  Loch Con and Loch Ard are each be-
tween two and three miles in length.  These lakes abound
with eel, pike, and trout, all esteemed excellent in their
kinds.  The fish caught here, however, bears no price, as
there is no market to which it can be brought; nor is there
any restriction with regard to the fisheries of these lakes.
   The river Forth has its rise in the western extremity of
this parish.  After passing through the lakes, and receiving
many accessions from the streams that descend from the
mountains, it bursts forth, at the lower extremity of Loch
Ard, with considerable magnificence, over a rock near 30
feet high.  Hence it flows with a less agitated current through
the eastern district of the parish, which forms a beautiful and
fertile valley, (denominated by the natives, according to a
correspondent Gaelic term, the Laggan), surrounded, like the
rest of this district, on all sides by hills, with a narrow open-
ing towards the S. E. by which the Forth, after having pas-
sed some woody heights, and a beautiful round hill, entirely
