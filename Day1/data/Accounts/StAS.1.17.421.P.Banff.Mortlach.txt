   So the average for the first 10 years, is 42 1/10, for the
second, 47 3/10.  Here it may be remarked, that the rule
for finding the population, by multiplying the births by 26,
seems from this instance to be exceedingly erroneous, for the
product of such multiplication would not in the present case
be the half of the reality.  The decrease in the last 10 years
is very observables and is probably to be ascribed to the cala-
mitous eighty two.  The difference betwixt the 1766 and
the 1788 in the foregoing tables the baptisms in the one be-
ing more than three times as many as those in the others will al-
so strike one: And for this difference no satisfactory reason
can be assigned.  It is likely, that, in the latter of those two
years, the effects of the 1782, which reduced the country in
general to much want and a train of consequent distresses,
were at their height; that the greatest number of emigrants
had then left the parish in search of employment and main-
tenance, among the farmers towards the south or in the ma-
nufacturing towns; and that, after that period, they began to
return, to find home more comfortable, and to increase.
Such is the attachment to one's native soil, that it is seldom
deserted but either from necessity or the gratification of an
ambitious desire; and as soon as circumstances will permit,
or the passion is cured, it is commonly resorted to again.  Of
