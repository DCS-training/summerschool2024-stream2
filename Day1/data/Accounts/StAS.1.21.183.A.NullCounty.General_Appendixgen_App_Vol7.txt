Lochridge, in which there are daily above a dozen of coalliers
who cut and draw every day above 150 load of coals, which
fell at 6 d. the load.
   The coalliers wages and necessary expences amount to
about one half of the produce.  The rest belongs to the pro-
prietor and the tacksman; and might still be wrought to
much greater advantage, especially iron, as there is much
excellent iron stone near that coal pit, stretching along
both sides of the Maike Glen, where there might be an iron
work with a blast furnace erected-there being plenty of free-
stone, lime and clay, all near it for building, and water suffi-
cient to turn any wheel or engine that might be necessary in
such a work.  Besides there should be, and will in all pro-
bability, in process of time, be a canal cut from the Clyde,
somewhere below Renfrew, adjoining to the Forth canal and
the Paisley canal, and coming up the Cart by the bridge of
Johnstone through Lochwinnoch, and through Kilbirnie near
the loch, and down the side of Garnock to Irvine, and even
below Irvine to the Troon; the whole length being nearly 25
miles, and the expence would be between 20 and 30,000 l.
It would be of great service to the Glasgow and Paisley mer-
chants and manufacturers in having their merchandize, etc.
conveyed to the open sea for America and the West Indies
in all weathers and on all occasions; whereas they now
sometimes lie 8 or 10 days wind bound at Greenock and
Port Glasgow.  It would also save 2000 l. or 3000 l. annually to
the people of Glasgow and Paisley, in the article of coal,
and as much in the articles of provisions of meal and eggs,
butter and cheese.  The meal in Ayrshire and Galloway is al-
ways 1 1/2 d. a peck, or 2 d. or 3 d. a stone cheaper than at Glas-
gow or Paisley; and a canal or water conveyance would soon
equalize it, and raise it a penny here, and lower it nearly as
much there.  Yea, it could come much sooner and safer
