        Botany.-This parish contains several of the rarer British
plants, and many which, either from their local distribution or
other circumstances, are deserving of notice. The banks of the
river are especially rich in vegetable production,-the number of
which is increased by the stream bringing down alpine plants and
seeds from their natuml situation, and establishing them upon its
sides. The fields, woods, moors, and hills abound in such plants
as generally characterize similar localities. The loch of Leys also
contains several species of considerable interest. There cannot
be a doubt that farther research would add several new species to
the Flora of the parish, although it has been repeatedly subjected
to botanical investigation. The first of the following lists contains
those plants which are rare or very local in Britain; the second
those which are otherwise interesting:-

Calamintha Acinos         Melampyrum sylvaticum          Orchis Morio
Galium erectum            Nuphar pumila                  Equisetum Mackaii.
Linnea borealis

The last named plant was first found in the parish in 1841, and has
not, it is believed, been discovered in any other part of Scotland.

	The existing plantations are very extensive, being equal to more
than five-sixths of the arable, and to more than one-fourth of the
whole surface. They consist chiefly, of pine and larch, with patches
of birch, and belts of oak, beeeh, ash, and some ornamental trees.
The greater part was planted during the last seventy years, and only
about one third of the whole is nearly ready for the market. The soil
especially on the beights near the river, is generally well adapted for
oak and other hard woods. Larch is found, however, to give way
After twenty or thirty years on certain dry and thin soils, and to be-
come diseased in the heart. Pines grow most profitably in the hol-
