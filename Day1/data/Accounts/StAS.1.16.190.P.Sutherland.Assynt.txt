     Statistical Account

was indeed a very infectious epidemical fever, which
having been introduced from other places, cut off a
great number, the stoutest and most vigorous in the space
of three days, others in that of four; if the infected survi-
ved the fifth, especially the seventh day, they generally
escaped.

   Instances of Longevity.-Mrs Christian Gray, daughter
of the Reverend Mr Alexander Gray, (the late learned and
worthy Episcopal parson here), died at the age of 100
years at least.  The narrator saw and often conversed with
her for one or two years after his admission in the 1765.
She retained the memory of every thing of importance
that came within her knowledge to the very close of life.
   Hugh Matthison, tenant in Baddy-danoch by Loch-Inver,
was, by his own account, 95 years of age.  He enjoyed
good health, and went a fishing in his little boat until within
some few days of his death.
   John Mackenzie, tenant in Clashmore, says, that he
is at the close of 100 years at least.  He can still thresh
corn, and do other domestic affairs.
   Mrs Mackenzie of Glenlerag, who died much about
1767, saw the fourth generation lineally descended from
her.  She was upwards of 100 years, and retained her me-
mory, etc. to her death.

   State of Property: Whether changeable or not.-The
property of this parish has perhaps undergone as few chan-
ges as any.  Tradition, and even documents declare*,

<FOOTNOTE>

*These documents are in the archives of the present noble proprietors
of this parish; and if the narrator remembers well, Sir Robert Gordon of
Gordonstoun hints at this fact, in his history of that ancient family.
