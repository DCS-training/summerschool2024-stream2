places loam.  The bottom is, in general, a blue or red clay, and
in some parts rather inclined to till.

   Rivers and Fish.-The Irvine, which rises a little above
Loudoun hill, runs on the northern boundary of the parish,
and is joined by many rivulets in the neighbourhood, in parti-
cular by the Glen, the Gower, the Burn-Anne, and the
Cessnock.
   All these streams have very good trout, and the Irvine, at
times, a few salmon.  The Burn-Anne trouts, though large,
are rather soft, as the stream comes from mossy grounds;
those of the Irvine, and of the Cessnock in particular, are little
inferior to char.  Liming the lands has diminished the num-
ber of the trouts from the noxious quality of that article
to fish.  But their greatest enemy is man.  The few salmon
that get over the mill-dams, are destroyed by means of hand
nets and harpoons.  Scarcely one salmon in a season can be
caught by the rod, where 20 to 30 years ago, any skilful person,
might, for his amusement, have killed scores of them.

   Lochs.-There are two lochs in the parish; one Loch-Gait,
at its eastern extremity, is a sheet of deep and clear water, a-
bounding in trouts and very large eels.  It is the chief source
of the water of Even, or Aven, which joins the Clyde below
Hamilton, and gives name to the parish of Strathaven, or A-
vendale.  The other is Brunt-wood loch, towards Mauchlin.
It breeds an immense number of wild ducks; and, in severe
winters, great flocks of swans frequent it for the benefit of the
springs.  A bird, which the people here call a hether blutter,
perhaps it is the bittern (it makes a loud roaring noise) built its
nest on the island in the loch, about eight or nine years ago,
but as some superstitious people suggested that its loud and un-
