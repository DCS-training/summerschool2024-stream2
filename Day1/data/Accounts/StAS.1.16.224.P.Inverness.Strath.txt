length, and from 1 to 2 in breadth, and is inhabited.  The
harbours are Loch Slapan, Loch Einart, and the Sound of
Scalpa, where vessels of any burden may safely anchor.
There are some fresh water lakes which are stored with red
and white trout, and in one of them there are a few sal-
mon, which, are caught in a copious rivulet that runs from
one of the lakes to the sea.  Oysters, lobsters, crabs, lim-
pets, spout-fish, and various other sorts of shell-fish, are to
be found on the shores.  The birds that most commonly
frequent the shores are the wild goose, solan goose, cor-
morant, scale-drake, duck, teal, sea magpie, crane, curlew,
plover, sandy lark, with gulls of different kinds.  In the
hills are deer, moorsowl, and black-game; the wild pigeon,
hooded crow, and eagle, nestle in the rocks.

least 25 years, and to the letting the lands to small tenants.
About 15 years ago, the whole parish was in the hands of
a few gentlemen, some of whom bad four or five farms;
but the number of gentlemen-farmers is now reduced to
one or two; and the other farms are let to small tenants,
and ten families, consisting of five persons each at an ave-
rage, are now living, where formerly there were not above
three.  Ten years ago the lift of examinable persons con-
tained upwards of 1200*; none included under 9 years of
age.  The present population, according to a lift made out
in June 1794, is 1579 souls:
