   The decrease of population has been caused, 1st, By emigra-
tion to North America; 2d, The joining of two or more posses,
sions together, and letting the whole to one tenant; 3d, The
principal heritor in the parish having taken several large farms
into his own hands, for the purpose of imprnving the same.
There are two blind old women, paupers, belonging to the
parish, but not residing in it. There are no insane, fatuous, deaf
or dumb persons in the parish, or belonging to it.
I The Gaelic language is spoken, and preferred by all the natives
as the medium of communication; but from their intermixture with
strangers, and the facility of intercourse with the low country, it
is fast losing ground, particularly among the young people.
   The introduction of new slated cottages, and the prizes given
by the Highland Society for the neatest and best kept houses and
gardens, have already effected a considerable improvement in pro-
moting a taste for cleanly habits, and shows how much may be
done in this respect, if the means and encouragement were af-
forded. Their clothing is plain, but comfortable; and in general
they are intelligent, moral, and religious. Drunkenness and quar-
relling is now, comparatively speaking, a matter of rare occur-
rence. Poaching and smuggling have been entirely, or almost
entirely, suppressed.
