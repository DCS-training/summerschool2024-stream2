are regularly recorded. For the six years that follow his trans-
portation to Glasgow, there is again a blank in the marriage re-
gister; but from 1832 both that and the baptismal one continue
to be duly kept. We have no register of deaths. The number
of yearly births varies considerably. For the last thirty years the
maximum is 85, and the minimum 18. The number of female
births in general exceeds that of male. Of marriages, the maxi-
mum is 15, and the minimum 2. Sometimes a year and more has
elapsed without a death. The greatest number I recollect within
a year is 11.

	The number of families at present is 147.
	There are no manufactories. Many years ago, a paper-mill was
erected on the Dee, which continued for some time in operation.
Contact with the population which it introduced had begun to tell
unfavourably on the manners of the original inhabitants, when, in
consequence of the failure of the proprietors, the establishment
was broken up, and has never since been reorganized. The ma-
chinery and all other materials belonging to it were sold, and the
building itself is falling rapidly to ruin.
	A better sample of Scottish yeomen will not easily be found
than what is supplied by the farmers of this parish. Their farms
are held on reasonable terms, and in pretty long leases. Two or
three only fall under L. 150 of yearly rent, and none exceed L. 500.
These are the limits within the range of which the greatest com-
fort and happiness may be expected for the farmer. Larger con-
cerns are unwieldy; by engaging in them, he is harassed, by
endless anxieties, and is apt to be led into dissipated habits and
ruinous speculations; while farms of a lower rent are insufficent
to yield a profit adequate to his comfort, or commensurate with his
labour, besides being always let too high by Coming within the
reach of a greater number of competitors. From the, character
and condition of the yeomen, there is at present no prospect of
any material or speedy change, in the general habits of the popu-
lation, which are entirely those of agricultural labourers. They
