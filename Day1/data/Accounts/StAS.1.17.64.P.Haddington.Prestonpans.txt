   Rents and Inclosures.-The rent of land is from 1 L. 11 s.
to 3 L. 10 s. per acre.  Almost all the parish is inclosed.
Walls built of stone and mortar form a great part of the in-
closures.  They are an immediate fence, take up less room
than hedges, and afford no shelter to birds.  The common
height is 4 1/2 feet above the surface.  The price of building is
3 L. 5 s. per rood, materials furnished by the builder.  In-
closures have considerably increased the rent of the lands.
The state of property has been fluctuating.  Within the
present century, the whole lands in the parish, with the ex-
ception of 4 or 5 acres, have been sold once, and some of the
estates much oftener.

   Wages and Prices of Labour.-The usual wages of a man
servants living in the family, are 5 L. Sterling per annum; of
a maid servants 3 L. Sterling; of a man servant, out of the
house, 6 1/2 bolls of oat meal, in money and other perquisites
from 5 L. 16 s. to 6 L. 11 s. 6 d.; a free house of 10 s. or
