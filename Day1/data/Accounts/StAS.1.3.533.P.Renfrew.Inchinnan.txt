wife, and do great justice to their farms, being all very in-
dustrious and attentive.  There are several very beautiful
hills in the parish, not high, but arable to the top; and few
parishes afford so many delightful situations for small country
feats.-There are about 2400 acres of ground in the parish.
About 100 acres are planted with common fir.  There are
few old trees in the parish, excepting a few at North Barr,
the seat of Lord Sempill.  There are about 200 acres yearly
in sown grass, for which they find good and ready markets
at Greenock and Paisley.  Every other kind of grain is sown

   Population.-The average of births, for the last 7 years, is
16; of marriages, 6; and of deaths about 4; though the
deaths cannot be so easily or exactly ascertained, as there is
no regular register kept of them.  It appears from the roll
book, that in 1695, there were 86 families in the parish; a-
bout 40 years ago, there were upwards of 100; and in 1791,
there are 68 families, which, upon the usual average of 4 1/2
persons to each family, makes the present population only
306.  The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was 397.  One
cause for this decrease of inhabitants, is owing to their
being so near Paisley, to which place most of the cottagers
have reported, on account of the encouragement they
meet with, from the flourishing state of the manufac-
turers; but the principal cause of the depopulation, is
owing to the largeness of the farms, one man renting
as much land now, as 3 or 4 did formerly.  Whatever
advantage this monopoly of farms may be to the proprietor,
or tenant, it is by no means favourable to the manufacturing
towns, or the country at large.  When farms are small, yet
sufficient to bring up a family, the children are all bred up
to industry.  Every article produced upon the farm is carried
