   Poor.-The poor's funds consists of a capital of 400 L. Ster-
ling.  This capital originated from two mortified sums; the
one a sum of 1119 L. 19 s. 4 d.  Scotch money, mortified to
the poor of the parish in the year 1701, by Mr James Alex-
ander, through whose means, chiefly, the three parishes were
united; the other, a sum of 1000 merks, mortified by John
Sharpe of Hoddom, in the year 1715.  By the interest hav-
ing, from different causes, been suffered to accumulate, these
sums have twelved to a capital of 400 L. Sterling.  Besides
the above, the weekly collections produce about 12 L.  Sterling
per annum.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are few parishes so well
provided with roads as that of Hoddom.  It is divided lon-
gitudinally almost into two halves, by the turnpike road lead-
ing from Gratenay to Moffat; and there are five cross roads,
all of which are equal to turnpike.  It may be proper to
mention the conveniency of us situation, in regard to one of
the principal commodities for improvement, viz. lime.  Lime
of excellent quality is to be got in great abundance, within
the distance of 2 miles.  This, together with the good roads,
has of late years greatly increased the value of the land, and
worth of the inhabitants.  The commencement of improve-
ments in this parish, and within the county of Dumfries in
general, may be dated from the year 1777, when a particu-

scription of heritors, to assets the proprietors of land, and
their tenants, in an annun sum, not exceeding 12 s. on each
