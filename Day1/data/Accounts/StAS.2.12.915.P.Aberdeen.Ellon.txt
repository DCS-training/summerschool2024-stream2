after three years' pasture, they take only one grain crop before
fallowing.  Such a shift, however, it is to be feared, cannot be ge-
nerally adopted while rents continue at their present rate and be-
sides, on strong clays and other similar soils, which are but ill
adapted to pasture and turnip husbandry, it must involve, under
any circumstances whatever, an obvious loss.
   The crops in this district of country have been, for many years,
as they still are, cut down by the scythe,-a method of reaping
which is not only less expensive, but which, on other accounts
also, is deemed preferable to the mode of cutting with the sickle,
formerly employed.  In the stack-yard, indeed, some loss is sus-
tained from the exposure to the weather of a greater proportion
of ears of grain in the stubble end of the sheaf, than when the
sickle is used; but this trifling loss is more than made up to the
farmer by the important circumstances, that the process of, mow-
ing takes the crop more effectually off the field, and renders it fit
also in a much shorter period of time for being safely transferred
to the stack-yard.-Females are employed for gathering the mown
corn into sheaves, one to each scythe; and perhaps the greatest
objection to this mode of reaping is, that when the crop is heavy
it necessarily throws upon the female labourer an undue proportion
of the hardest work.  Females are employed also in hoeing, in barn
work, and in the other lighter kinds of agricultural labour.  Such
work is not, indeed, too hard for them; but still it may be question-
ed whether the female part of the population are not now engaged
in out of door employments to an improper extent; as a constant
application to such employments, even if it were not otherwise in-
jurious, necessarily leaves them less time for improving themselves
in matters of domestic economy, and consequently for undertaking
the management of a family.
   Improvements.-In draining, in the reclaiming of waste land,
and in the adoption and steady prosecution of the most improved
systems of husbandry, the farmers in this parish have displayed,
with very few exceptions, much spirit and energy.  In some in-
stances, indeed, they have been encouraged and assisted in carry-
ing forward their more weighty improvements by the liberal co-
operation of their landlords; but even where this stimulus has been
wanting, or applied but in a very moderate degree, their own well-
directed exertions have effected many improvements of an import-
ant character.  Perhaps no part of the country possesses a more in-
