curate estimate in regard to temporary disease on a small scale,
its extent of prevalence, and length of duration.  Let us take as
instances the disease of cholera and that of influenza, whose wide-
spreading ravages over the whole community will long be remem-
bered;--though the latter is not to be compared to the former in
point of destructiveness, yet, as being more recent, it is at pre-
sent more impressive.  Who could possibly foresee the prevalence
of these, or form any calculation as to their effects, and yet the
stability of friendly societies depends much on such contingencies.
If their funds are large, and well economized by a continuance of
general good health among the members, they may be able to keep
their ground, but this would hardly be possible with limited re-
sources, and a great proportion of the contributors reduced to the
necessity of requiring weekly aliment.  Accordingly, such seasons
of pressure have, from time to time, upset numbers; but that they
are not so fluctuating as might be supposed, may be seen from the
following list of those now existing for the parishes of Ayr, New-
ton, and Wallacetown, exhibiting the dates of their commencement,
and the sums they have respectively disbursed.

  There are also several Female Societies in Ayr, conducted on the
same principle, and among the rest we may notice that called Lady
Crawford's, of long standing, and which has done a great deal of
good among indigent females. It derived its name from the Coun-
tess of Crawford, by whom it was instituted.

  The society consists partly of honorary and partly of general
members,--the former paying a small sum yearly without any
prospect of a return,--the latter so much per quarter, and receiv-
ing a certain allowance weekly in sickness or old age.  One member
was on the funds betwixt fifteen and sixteen years, and received
L. 120, 1s. 6d.  Had it not been for the charity of certain influential
persons, it probably would have been long ere now extinct.  There
