nor had the undertakers sufficient ability to carry on the
work to any great extent.  But the Easdale slate com-
pany, who now manage the quarries, having obtained a
long lease, not only of the slate, but likewise of the
marble quarry at Ardmady in this parish, commenced
the work upon a larger scale.  The marble quarry has
been discontinued, though some think it might be still
wrought to advantage.  The slate quarries were more
than sufficient, however, to employ all the hands that
were engaged in the marble, the demand of for slates be-
ing greater than can well be supplied, particularly since
the late war with America.  The quarriers are of late
increased to about 300 men;  All these, except a few.
have families.  Some of them are calle quarriers, o-
thers day-labourers or feuars.  The quarriers are paid
for the quantity of slates which they manufacture, an-
nally; some of them 1 s. or 12 s., and others 15 s a
10 s, in proportion to the difficulty or facility of work-
ings, and the expense that attends it.  The day-labour-
ers or feuars have 9 d. or 10 d. a-day thorugh the year;
and are employed, at the company's expense, in opening
quarries and removing the rubbish.  From the com-
pany's books, it apperas, that about 5,000,000 of slates
are quarried annually.  These may be manufactured,
of any dimension, from flags of 3 or 4 feet square, to
the smallest size, if the quality of the quarry is good.
The workmens wages amounted last year to near 4000 L.
Sterling.  They seem to live very comfortably; many
of them can easily save money; and though they should
be in debt to the company, they are indulgent enough
to allow them whatever is necessary for supporting their
families.  The company keep always a store of the ar-
ticles most necessary for them,  particularly meal, iron.
