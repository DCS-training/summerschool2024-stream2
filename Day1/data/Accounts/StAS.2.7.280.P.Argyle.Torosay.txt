cave,-a name given to it probably by the Danes when they had
possesion of the Hebrides.  Its spaciousness might leacd them su-
perstitiously to regard it as one of the abodes of their principal
deity.  The floor of the inner cave is covered with rubbish, in
which the bones of terrestrial animals abound.  They bear no
marks, however, of having been gnawed, so that it is probable the
animals to which, they belonged, particularly as they are of exist-
ing and indigenous genera, were devoured by outlaws or banditti
living in the cave.
   Meteorology-The climate in this parish, like that of the rest
of the island is mild in the habitable parts of it, which are chiefly
situated on the coast.  The summits of the mountains, however,
owing to their great altitude, are seldom free of snow, from the
beginning of November till the middle of April.  The mean tem-
perature is 47&deg; of Fahrenheit.  The mean pressure of the atmo-
sphere is 29.75 inches.  The prevailing winds are the south-west,
the west, and the north-west; and very often, during a hard gale,
it blows successively from all these points in the order above-stated.
Rainy weather may be prognosticated, with a good deal of cer-
tainty, when the tops of the mountains become enveloped with
thick clouds in motion.  On the other hand, fair weather may be
expected, when thin and broken fleeces of white mist appear
slowly ascending from the sides of the mountains, and when the
summits are but partially covered.
   Where so many high mountains intercept the vapour wafted by
the prevailing wind from the face of the ocean, a considerable
quantity of rain, as might be expected, falls, but not more than
the nature of the soil requires,
