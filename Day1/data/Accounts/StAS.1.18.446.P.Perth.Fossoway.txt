poems concerning the ancestors of the family, were handed
down to posterity, and were repeated to the whole clan on
solemn occasions.  Tulliebole, therefore, seems to have been
the residence, at a very early period, of some independent
chief, in the same manner that Tullibardine, or the hill of
the bards, was the seat of the chieftain of the Murrays.
   Formerly Fossaway and Tulliebole were two separate parish-
es, and each had its own pastor and church.  The annexation,
it is said, took place sometime about the year 1614.  In the
Advocates Library, there is an ancient manuscript, which is
entitled, "Register of Assignations for the Ministers' Stipends,
"for the year 1574."  In this manuscript, the stipends of
the readers of the two parishes, are separately stated thus.
"John Henderson, reader at Tulliebole, his stipend, L. 16,

the Shire, Diocese, Presbytery, and Commissariot, in which
each of them is situated; in which Fossaway is thus stated,

   This is evidence, that both parishes were at an early period
in the Diocese of Dumblane.  After the annexation down
to the year 1729, the two places of worship, the one at Fossa-
