   In 1763-The shore-dues at Leith (a small tax paid to the
city of Edinburgh on landing goods at the quays) amounted to 
L. 580.
   In 1783-The Shore-dues at Leith were upwards of L. 4000.
   N. B.  There was a considerable importation of grain to the
port of Leth in 1783, not less than L. 800,000 sterling
having gone out of Scotland for this year's deficiency of
grain.  But the Shore-dues are often above L. 3,503
per annum, independent of any extraordinary importation.
From Nov. 1788 to Nov. 1789, they were L. 3455: 14: 4.
-This revenue, from its nature, must be fluctuating.
   In 1763, and for some years after-There was one ship that
made an annual voyage to Petersburgh; and never brought
sallow, if any other cargo offered.  Three tons of sallow were
imported into Leith in 1763, which came from Newcastle.
   In 1783-The ships from Leith and the Fifth of Forth to
the Baltic amounted to some hundreds.  They make two voy-
ages in the year, and sometimes three.  In 1786, above 2500
tons of sallow were imported directly from the Baltic into

far as could he ascertained, by a survey for road money, (for many industri-
ously avoided the survey) amounted to 13,806; this, at the same rate of six
to a family, (which is held to be a proper ground of calculation in Edinburgh)
makes the number of inhabitants 82,836.  Besides, this number is exclusive
of the Castle, all the hospitals, poor houses, infirmary, dispensary, etc-
Arnot, upon the same data, says 80,836-but this is a typographical er-
ror.-Since 1775, the city and suburbs have been much extended; and the
inhabitants must also have greatly increased.
   N B It is a striking fact, that either the former population of Edinburgh
has been very erroneously represented, or the luxury of the present inha-
bitants has increased in a very uncommon degree; because, without much
apparent increase of population, the valued rent of the city and suburbs,
according to the cess-books, has been more than doubled.
