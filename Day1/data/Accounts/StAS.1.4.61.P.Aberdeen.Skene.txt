of both rocks and stones, and a considerable part of it wet
and spongy), the small progress which agriculture hath hi-
therto made, and I may add the quantity of moss in the pa-
rish.  The last assertion may appear paradoxical.  It is ne-

   Stipend, Church, Poor, etc.-The stipend, includ-
ing the glebe, is from L. 70 to L. 80 Sterling.  Mr Skene
of Skene is patron.  When the church was built nobody

There are 4 heritors in the parish, two of whom only re-
