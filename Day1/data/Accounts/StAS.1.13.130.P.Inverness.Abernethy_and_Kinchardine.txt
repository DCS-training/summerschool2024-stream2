tioned under the name of Abernethy.  It is 15 miles in 
length, and from 10 to 12 in breadth, and about 30 miles
from the sea at Inverness, Nairn, or Findhorn.  The sur-
face is very much diversified with corn-fields, woods, and 
mountains.  The soil is various; some parts deep, others 
thin and dry, some wet and cold.  A stretch of about 3 
miles of low deep land and meadow, on the bank of the 
Spey, is often overflowed in times of floods.  The Spey 
here runs smooth and flow, and of course the overflow is 
so too.  Although many hundreds of acres are in this si-
tuation, and would increase greatly in their value, if free
of this encroachment; yet it appears doubtful if embank-
ments could save the ground; and still more problematical,
whether the acquisition would be worth the expense, which
behoved to be very great, on account of the great height
to which Spey rises at certain times.  What increases the
difficulty is, the great body of water which, in time of
floods, comes from the mountains in the Nethy and smaller
rivulets, and which would come in behind the embank-
ments; besides the proprietor has a great deal of land on
the other side in the fame predicament, so that double em-
bankments would be necessary.  The arable ground bears
but a small proportion to the uncultivated.  A great pro-
portion of the surface is covered with woods, much of it in
hills, mountains, and rocks.  The grounds rises towards the
mountains, and the air and climate vary accordingly.
Healthy every where.  The people in general enjoy
health to a degree that is not expected in many parts of
the kingdom  The small-pox is the only disease that is re-
markably fatal.  Inoculation is not general, though, upon 
the whole, peoples prejudies against it are much removed.*
