the whole Island; and Gaelic names, it may be observed, still
prevail to a very great extent in it, particularly in Scotland;
for, although a foreign language was brought nither from 
the Continent by the ancestors of the greater part of the pre-
sent inhabitants, many original names, particularly those of
places, were naturally retained.  Thus, Dundas (a place in
this parish) is said to be the Gaelic for "hill of fallow deer*;"
Mons hill, for a "hill uncultivated."  Instances of such deri-
vations are numerous in the neighbourhood, and elsewhere;
as the Forth, or the "water," Inch Garvy, or "rough island;"
Kirkliston, or "a place inclosed on a river;" Linlithgow, or 
"dog's pool;" Torphichen, or "fight-hill;" Calder, or "oak-
"wood."  The language which was brought from the Con-
tinent, and which is now general over the island, was partly
introduced by the Anglo-Saxons, in the fifth century, into
England; and partly by the Dano-Saxons, in the ninth and
eleventh, both into England and Scotland.  The Dano-Saxon
has continued to be spoken in the greater part of Scotland,
and particularly what is called the Lowlands, with little devi-
ation from the original, till near the present times, in which
it has been giving place very rapidly to the modern English
language.  The cause of this, independent of the compara-
tive merits or demerits of the two dialects, has been the union
of the Scottish and English crowns; from which, as England
is the larger and wealthier country, and is, besides, the court
end of the Island, the English tongue has gained the ascen-
dancy, and become the standard of fashion and of propriety.

*Horns of deer have lately been dug up in its skirts; and 
some bones of such dimensions, as render it probable that they
belonged to the moose-deer, or some other of the largest of the 
flag species.
