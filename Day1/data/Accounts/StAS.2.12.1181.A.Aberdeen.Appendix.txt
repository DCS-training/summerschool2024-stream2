Andrews some years previously, without any aid being raised by
private subscriptions.
   The conditions on which the Treasury agreed to advance the
above sum of L.15,000, together with the interest accruing on
the whole sum set `part in 1826, arose from a proposal made by
the College to guarantee, within five years, the completion of a
new edifice of an extent not inferior to that in the sketches of Mr
Reid, His Majesty's Master of Works in Scotland, who had visited
Aberdeen in February 1834 for the purpose of obtaining informa-
tion as to the accommodation required.  Their Lordships termed
the offer made by the College "liberal," and considered it unne-
cessary that the King's architect should be employed,-the plan
and site adopted being still left subject to their approbation.  This
allowed the Principal and Professors again to bring forward, with
such improvements as the delay had suggested, the plans prepared
in 1825 by Mr Archibald Simpson, architect, whose excellent taste
and great ability have been displayed in the new edifice, as they
have been in the Assembly Rooms, the Infirmary, and other prin-
cipal buildings erected of late years in Aberdeen.
   The subscriptions of the numerous alumni and friends of the
college now commenced, the town of Aberdeen giving L.1050
the Chancellor of the University, the late George, Duke of Gor-
don, L.500, the Principal and Professors, L.500, &c.  In about
three months, they amounted to nearly L.5000, but soon after-
wards they experienced a check from the agitation connected with
a bill brought into Parlialent, which met with great opposition
from the public generally, because it attempted to divest the Col-
leges of all management of their property, and by its provisions
for uniting them, to injure greatly the interests of University edu-
cation in the north of Scotland.  Although this bill was with-
drawn in an early stage, yet the prospect of speedily obtaining the
Government grant continued to be clouded by the revival of the
subject of the Union in other shapes; and it was not till after a
tedious negociation that the Treasury approved of the plan and
estimate finally transmitted by the College, and engaged to pay
L.15,000 as soon as L.6000 of subscriptions were realized, and on
these L.21,000 being expended to their satisfaction, to pay the ad-
dition of accrued interest, the edifice to be completed in June 1841.
On this occasion, the magistrates and town-council of Aberdeen
assisted the College in guaranteeing the erection of a building
to the above extent, in the hope, that, while the work was in pro-
