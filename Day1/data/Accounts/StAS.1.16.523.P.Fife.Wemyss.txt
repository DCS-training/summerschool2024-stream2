     of Wemyss.

   Exports and Imports.-Coal and salt are the only exports.
The quantity differs according to the demands.  At an
average there is shipped at Wester Wemyss annually 6000
tons of coal, mostly for Amsterdam, Hamburgh, and
Middleburgh, being of a quality particularly suited for light-
houses.  The light on the island of May, at the entrance
of the frith of Forth, is supplied from this coal*.
   About 40,000 bushels of salt are annually shipped from
this parish for the different ports from Dundee to Inver-
ness.
   The imports are mostly oak-timber for ship-building,
Memel and Norway timber, deals, etc.  Gottenburgh iron,
deals and battons; in all about 10 cargoes in the year.

   Bridges and Roads.-There are no bridges in the parish,
but a small one over a rivulet that passes through Easter
Wemyss, nor is there any need for more.  The turnpike-
road from Kirkcaldy to Cupar by Kennoway, and to the
east of Fife, passes through the north part of the parish;
but from its distance from the coast, being near 1 1/2 mile,
the greater part of the inhabitants reap little advantage
from it.

   Inns.-There are properly no inns, but there are a suf-
ficient number of houses where ale and spirits are sold.

   Price of Provisions and of Labour.-The price of provi-
sions and of labour has considerably advanced of late years.
The price of butcher meat is from 4 d. to 5 1/2 d. a-pound
tron, at different seasons of the year; of butter, from 7 1/2 d.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As there is now a pretty certain prospect of the great coal in the
east part of the parish being again wrought, it is probable that a much
greater quantity of coal will be exported from the port of Methil.
