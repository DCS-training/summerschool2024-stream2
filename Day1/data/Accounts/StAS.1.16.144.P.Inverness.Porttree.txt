the sea.  It is composed of different kinds of burnt stone,
lime, and shell, that have all the appearance of being jum-
bled together, some time or other, by a volcanic eruption,
and is of such firm and solid consistence, that the largest
hammer, wielded by the strongest arm, could scarcely
make any impression upon it.  There are several rocks of
the same kind in that part of the island; one of which,
more curious than the rest, rises higher than that on which
the cattle stands, close by it, like an old and ruinous wall,
from 5 to 8 feet broad, and 40 long, and in most places it
is covered with ivy.  This curious rock, on account of its
ruinous and decayed appearance, was called Broichin, and
from it the castle got its name.  The castle was built with
stone and lime, is two storeys high, besides an attic one
the rooms are all very small, except one, supposed to be
the kitchen, and two others, about 11 feet square, and as
many high, in which are chimneys.  In the middle was a
small open court, in which was a well, but whether sup-
plied with water from a fountain in the hill above, or from
the rock itself, is not known.  It is not long since the
last part of the roof came down, and some broken joists
still remain sticking out in the sides of some of the rooms.
John Garbh is said to be the last who dwelled in it.  This
John Garbh was one of the predecessors of the pre-
sent Laird of Raasay, and lived in the times of James VI.
of Scotland.  He was remarkably stout and athletic, of
extraordinary personal strength and valour, and therefore
was surnamed Garbh, a word which is expressive of lusti-
ness and ableness of body.  Many are the stories related
regarding his acts of prowess and fortitude, as likewise of
severals of his countrymen, who are said to have been in
general of more than ordinary size and stoutness, but border-
ing rather on the marvellous, seem not altogether worthy
of much credit.
