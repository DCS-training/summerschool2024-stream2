     PARISH OF KILRENNEY.

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM BEAT.

     Name, Situation, Extent, and Soil.

   THE name of this parish seems to be derived from
the saint to whom the church was dedicated, viz.
St Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, whose fame for piety was
at that time great throughout Christendom.  What serves
to confirm this origin of the name is, that the fishermen,
who have marked out the steeple of this church for a meath
or mark to direct them at sea, call it St Irnie to this day;
and the estate which lies close by the church is called Irnie-
hill; but, by the transposition of the letter i, Rinnie-hill. What
adds to the probability of this interpretation, is a tradition
still existing here, that the dovotees at Anstruther, who could
not see the church of Kilrenney till they travelled up the ri-
sing ground to what they called the Hill, then pulled off
their bonnets, fell on their knees, crossed themselves, and
prayed to St Irnie.

   This parish lies in the county and synod of Fife, and pres-
bytery of St Andrews.  It is about 2 miles long, and 2 broad,
almost in the form of a cirle, somewhat elliptical on the coast.
It is bounded by Crail on the east; Anstruther on the west;
