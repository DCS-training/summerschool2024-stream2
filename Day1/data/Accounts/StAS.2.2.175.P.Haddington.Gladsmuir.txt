and has long furnished the chief supply to the eastern parts of the
county. It was wrought when Oliver Cromwell was in this coun-
try, about the middle of the seventeenth century, and drew then
a rent of L. 400. In 1834, it was found that the field lying to
the south of the village of Penston had been very much wrought
out; and a new tenant having succeeded to the lease of the farm,
and also of the coal, a new pit was opened a little to the north of
the Heninuir, and the coal has been wrought there ever since. But
as most of the coal has been already wrought in that part of the
property, borings were made in different places to the north of the
village of Penston, and a pit was sunk in that quarter about a gun-
shot to the south of the great road. The operations there were, for
some time, very much retarded by an influx of water; but a steam-
engine was erected, and the water having been carried off, the work
is now going on briskly, and a great quantity of coal is brought out
and disposed of. The coal is of an excellent quality. The seam
is about thirty-two inches thick, while the Pawnwood coal is from
four to five feet thick. There are now two engines at work, and
that part of the field is yet unbroken. At the same time, the work
at the Henmuir is still going on. The coal-grieve at Penston has
been so good as furnish me with an account of the different stra-
tifications that were met with in the, boring for coal, in August 1834.
