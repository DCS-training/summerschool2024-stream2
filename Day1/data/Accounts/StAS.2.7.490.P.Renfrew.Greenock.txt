         In addition to his other duties, the chaplain teaches the younger
      prisoners daily.  The members of the Greenock Ladies'Associa-
      tion visit and converse with the female prisoners six hours in the
      week.
         I It is the opinion of those who have the best opportunities of
      being informed on the subject, that offences against person and
      property are on the increase irf this district, owing partly to the
      increase of the native population, and partly to the influx of arti-
      sans and others employed in the manufactories in the town and
      neighbourhood.
         The health of the prisoners seems to be carefully attended to,
      in respect of diet and lodging.  It is to be regretted, however,
      that the site of the prison is low and confined ; and that the air-
      ing ground is not more extensive.  The prison is well secured.
      There is a comlunication between it and the sheriff-court room
      which is almost immediately adjoining.
        Fairs.-There are two fairs yearly, one on the first Thursday
      of July, and the other on the fourth Tuesday of November.
        Inns,  Alehouses, &c.-There are 31 inns and taverns in Gree-
      nock, and 275 houses for retailing ale and spirituous liquors.
      Taking the last of these separately, and computing the population
      of the whole parish at 30,000, there is a spirit or beer-shop to
      every 25 families, or thereabouts.  The total number of licenses
      for inns and alehouses of all descriptions in 1821, was 233; it is
      now 306.  The inrease, it is satisfactory to think, is not in pro-
      portion to the increase of the population; yet it cannot be denied
      that the number of spirit and ale-shops far exceeds the real wants
      of the inhabitants of the district, and affor& a lamentable, but ob-
