     Statistical Account

manufactory of woollen cloth, a few years ago, set up, which
is not as yet carried on to great extent.  The roads are not
in a very good state.  They have been made originally by
statute labour, and by it are repaired; sometimes it is com-
muted, and it is the general wish, that it were all com-
muted on moderate terms.  There are pretty good bridges
in the most frequented roads; and a bridge over the Ythan
at Ellon, is very soon to be built.  The money requisite for
it is already almost raised by a voluntary subscription.  The
rent of some land in this parish, is from 30 s. to 40 s. per
acre; in general, good land is valued at 13 s. or 15 s. per
acre, and a great deal at 10 s. some at 5 s. and some much
lower.  There is but little ground inclosed, except some
about the heritor's houses, and by a few of the principal far-
mers; all are convinced of the advantages of inclosures, and 
would generally set about inclosing, if they had long enough
leases.  There are five alehouses in the parish, and one inn
in the town of Ellon.
