need hardly be dwelt upon; and the whole system is evidently
contrary to the axiom, so ably inculcated by a great political
author*, " that the strength of a country does not so much
" depend on the comparative number of its inhabitants, as on
" their being equally spread along its surface, and exercised
" in healthful industry. "
   Notwithstanding these disadvantages, it appears, at present,
to be the wish of the landholders, in the western districts of
Scotland, to give every possible encouragement to all kinds of
manufactures+; may, such is the rage for them in this parish,
that corn mills are despised, of forgotton, even by their proprie-
tors.  Two have been allowed to go into total disrepair; one of
these has been advertised for a cotton-work; and a third,
though in good repair, has been actually superseded, and is
now an appendage to 3 cotton-mill, so that there are at
this time, only two corn mills in the whole district, to the
no small inconvenience of the farmers.
   As matters now stand, every good citizen will have it
at heart to prevent, as far as his influence and example
will go, the disadvantages that may follow; and above all,
the evils that may be dreaded from a relaxation in the
morals of the people, which were formerly so pure, and
unexceptionable, in this district that not above one or two acts,
at the utmost, of unnatural or barbarous violence, are ever re-
membered to have taken place in the parish of Nielston.

+Bleachfields have also their disadvantages; the work peo-
ple upon them are exposed much to wetness, and cold, which
in the high parts of the country is often intense, and is apt to
lead to the too frequent use of spirituous liquors.  Not a few em-
ployed at them, come and go without certificates of their moral
character.
