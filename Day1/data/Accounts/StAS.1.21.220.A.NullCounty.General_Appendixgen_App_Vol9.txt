other shores of Scotland; and every kind of birds, wild and
tame, almost, that are common to the hill and low countries
in Scotland, are in this parish.  The migratory kind are,
the swallow, cuckow, and French plover.  There is red and
black game in the hilly part; partridges and other birds in
the fields; hares in the hills and fields; and rabbits in the
links.  Sometimes deer straggle down from the Highlands to
the planting of Dunrobin.
   The fox has still a footing in this, and in every other part
of the county, much to the detriment of the game.  The
fox kills the young of the deer wherever it finds them, and
destroys the young moor-fowl; nor do the sheep escape alto-

and the name of the place where he killed the fox, specifying
also whether it is male or female, old or young; and if a female,
whether or not it had milk in its teats, or was with young.
After this ceremony is over, the huntsman cuts off the ears
of the fox, in sight of the inspector, and carries them away
carefully, to be kept in retentis till the 30th of April, on
which day the premium is to be paid.  On the 30th of April,
unless it falls on a Sunday, the commissioners of supply and
justices of the peace meet in the county burgh, chiefly for
the purpose of transacting the fox business, where all the
