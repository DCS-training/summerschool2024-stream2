but the ax and adze, which some of them can are very dex-

   There is no wheat raised in this parish.  The prevailing
crops are oats and peace, sown in April; and bear, or bear
and barley intermixed, which they commonly sow in May.
Since the year 1782, when the crop of oats in this parish
failed so much, that scarcely any of them were sit for sow-

drought or wetness of the summer, and the exposure of the
farms.  But on some grounds near the shore, the seasons
are perhaps as early as in any corner of Scotland.  For here

and reap it frequently in the end of July, or beginning of
August.  On there light grounds, a very simple rotation is
practised, of barley and a green crop alternately.  The green
crop is peace or potatoes; for turnips, though a better pre

   In the higher and deeper grounds, no regular rotation of
crops is followed, except on the heritor's own farms, where
a good many of the modern improvements are practised
with success
   The great aim of the country tenants, is to raise as much
bear and barley as possible, which, finding a ready market
with the highland distillers in Ferrintosh and Redcastle,
turns out to be the most profitable crop.  Most of those te-
