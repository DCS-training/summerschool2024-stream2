Appendix to the

the place, in consequence of an act of Parliament obtained
for that purpose, but without any public aid or contribution
whatever.
   By the erection of this pier, the navigation channel at
the entry of the harbour has been deepened and improved
to a degree much beyond any thing that was previously ex-
pected, although it be 200 feet shorter than Mr Smeaton's
original plan, which was in whole 1400 feet in length.
Before erection of the North Pier, the harbour-mouth was
always very much interrupted, and sometimes almost en-
tirely shut up by a bar, or large bank of shifting sand, upon
which, at low water, there was sometimes not above 18
inches or 2 feet in deepness; and at high water, even in
spring-tides, not above 13 feet; and as this bar was fre-
quently shifting and varying its situation, according as it
was acted upon by the storms of the sea or the floods of the
river, few shipping were in safety to take the harbour until
first it was sounded by a pilot, and the situation of the bar,
as well as the deepness of water, ascertained; whereas,
since the North Pier was built, small vessels, drawing 7 or
8 feet, have come into the harbour at low-water; and at
high-water, on spring-tides, there is now from 18 to 20 feet
in deepness at the entry, as the former bar, or bank of sand,
is now, by the confinement of the river, and the increased
velocity of the current, carried out into the sea at least a
quarter of a mile farther than it formerly was; so that we
now see vessels of considerable burden, in the violence of
a storm blowing right upon the land, making for and sailing
into the harbour with safety, even without the assistance of
any pilot, which no ship could have before attempted, with-
out the greatest danger of being wrecked on the bar, or
some part of the adjacent coast.
