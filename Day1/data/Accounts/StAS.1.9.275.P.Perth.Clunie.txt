wood, all serving as the common fuel of the inhabitants.
Good stones every where abound, for building fences and
houses.  Marl of an excellent quality lies at no great di-
stance, and the ground is well calculated for marl; besides,
it has almost every where a slope, favourable for draining;
and though in many places it is difficult to be cleared, yet
in ordinary seasons, and under due management, it never
fails to repay the labour and expense bestowed upon it.
The farmers begin to be sensible of these advantages, and to
make a proper use of them.  But, on the other hand, they
labour under several inconveniencies, which, it is hoped,
will in a short time be removed.  Servants wages are ex-
orbitant.  The want of day labourers is a great hindrance
to agricultural improvement.  The tenants cannot be re-
conciled to the idea of meliorating their climate and soil,
by raising belts of leathered wood on the N. E. and W.
sides of inclosures.  The burn of Lunan is suffered to in-
undate and render half useless many valuable acres of
ground in the park of Laighwood, and barony of Clunie,
a devastation that might be prevented in both places by
straighting and banking the burn, which, it is thought,
could be done in a substantial manner, at an expense not
exceeding L. 200 Sterling.  The materials for building
good houses abound in the parish; many of the people live
in miserable smoky cribs, more like sties for hogs than
habitations for men.  Several of the farmers have too short
leases, and some of them no leases at all; and conse-
quently, are discouraged from carrying on improvements
to any extent.  The old oppressive customs of bonnage,
thirlage, and servitudes, (disgraceful to the country, and to
humanity), are not yet quite abolished.  The public roads,
though lately somewhat improved, are still, during one
half of the year at least, extremly indifferent; though
there is some reason to expect, that the commutation of
