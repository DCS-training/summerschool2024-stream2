          north from the ford by which Baliol's army crossed the river; and
          another on the south of Forteviot, upon a rising grounds called
          Dronachy, lying broken over at the pedestal, on which are many
          emblematical figures.  About half-a-mile north from the first of
          these, a large tumulus or cairn was opened about thirty years
          ago, by the people repairing a road in the neigbourhood, and in
          it were found some coffins formed of rough flat stones, containing
          many fragments of bones, and some trinkets in various figures, of
          a vitrified substance and blackish colour; and, a few years ago,
          some urns were dug up at the west boundary of the parish, when
          the road was repairing between Invermay and Dunning.
             The ruinous buildings on the Halyhill were visited as an object
          of curiosity, so late as the reign of Charles I.; but nothing now
          remains of these buildings, and only a part of the eminence where-
          on they stood, as the water of May, by undermining below, is con-
          tinually washing away less or more of the rubbish.  The King's
          Haugh, a little east from the place, still retains the name.  Tra-
          dition informs us, that some houses in the neighbourhood have
          been built, or rebuilt, of the stones of the palace at Halyhill; and
          some of these are easily distinguished by the antiquated figures cut
          thereon, in the possession of Lord Ruthven.

	    Mansion-House.-Invermay House, the residence of the old
          family of Belshes, is the only mansion in the parish.  It is a mo-
          dern structure, plain and neat, beautifully situated on a rising
          ground overhanging the May (a rivulet that takes its rise among
          the Ochils, flows through the length of the grounds, and intersects
          them in its course) and, commanding an extensive view of the ro-
          mantic and picturesque scenery around, and of the rich vale of
