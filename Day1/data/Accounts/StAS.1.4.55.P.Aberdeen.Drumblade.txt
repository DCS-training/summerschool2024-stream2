     of Drumblade.

   Church, Stipend, Poor, etc.-The church was rebuilt in
1773.  The former church had been built in the year 1110,
as appears from raised figures upon one of the keep stones
of the east end; and the appearance of the work seemed
to confirm its antiquity.  The value of the living, includ-
ing the glebe, is L. 67: 15: 8.  The Earl of Kintore is
patron.  The number of poor receiving support from the
funds, on an average of 5 years, is 12.  The last year's a-
mount of the contributions, and the produce of alms, lega-
cies, and all the other funds destined to their use, was
L. 24: 10: 5.

their condition; are humane, and discover their humani-
ty on every occasion.  The having a little more the com-
mand of money at first setting out in the world,
might greatly meliorate their condition.  The roads in
this parish are not in good repair, on account of the clay
soil, the want of gravel, the great length of highway, and
the small number of people to look after it.  The statute-
labour is, however, exacted, and but in very few instances
commuted.  There are no turnpikes; the general opinion
seeming to be against them.

   Antiquities.-There are three tumuli in this parish; the
largest, Meet-hillock, is near Slioch, where King Robert
Bruce encamped, when he came N. in pursuit of some of
the adherents of Cummine Earl of Badenoch, after defeat-
ing that nobleman at Inverurie.  A small hill above that
tumulus is called to this day Robin's Height, and bad on the
