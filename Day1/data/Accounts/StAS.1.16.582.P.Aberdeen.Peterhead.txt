and produced a very rich crop, with very little fodder, and
I find the preference has in general been given to crop
1784.  The harvest was likewise rainy and late; the oats
were filled, but in general never ripened, or rather were
never of a proper yellow colour; many farmers were too
impatient; some permitted their oats to stand all the month
of November, and were sensible they ripened more in that
mouth than at any former period.  One farmer in this
parish dismissed his reapers in the end of October; he left
one large inclosure where the oats were quite green; they
filled perfectly during the month of November, and gave
as much meal as any oats on his farm.  I could mention
many other instances in other years of the propriety of not
being too hasty in cutting down oats before they are com-
pletely filled, though the season is late.  On the whole,
there never was a more plentiful crop than in 1784.  Meal
was selling about Candlemas next year at L. 8 Scots; be-
fore next harvest it could have been purchased below 10 s.
each boll, the last crop exceeding every person's expecta-
tion, and what was more extraordinary, the oats that were
green, and had been reserved as of least value, producing as
much meal as those that appeared to be fully ripened.
   The greatest part of the pease of this crop was entirely
lost, and never taken off the ground for want of good wea-
ther to dry the straw.  I had myself that year a field of
from six to seven acres in pease and beans, four acres in
beans, and two and a half in pease; the pease were sown
in the beginning of March, and completely covered, by
getting the ground harrowed; from that time to the end
of April 1 only found one day for sowing my beans; they
were sown, but I could only, from the constant rains, give
the ground a slight touch with the harrow; the greatest
part of the beans being still uncovered, I collected a few
boys, each with a stick in his hand, and pushed every bean
