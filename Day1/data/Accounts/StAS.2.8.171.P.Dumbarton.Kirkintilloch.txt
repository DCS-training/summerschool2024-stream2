  The following is the state of the winds for each month during
that remarkable year 1799:

good, latter half very wet. 1768, early crop, but light and deficient; 1769, tolerable
good crop. 1770, crop in good land excellent, high lands deficient, fodder plentiful.
1771, very bad crop,ill secured, and heated. 1772, rather late, and scarcely a medium,
In the month of June in this year, hailstones of great size fell in many places, in some
places it is said as large as nutmegs. 1773, a terrible storm in March, rest of the sea-
son rather favourable, a tolerable crop. 1774, dreadful storm, September 30, and
again in December 5, 6, 7, which did much damage by sea and land; altogether a
wet late season, with a low average crop; 1775, great storm October 19, and again in
November, the rest ofthe season excellent, and prices low. 1776, mediunm season and
crop. 1777, late season, and crop indifferent. 1778, much the same as last. 1779, a
great frost, which lasted eighty-four days, the season otherwise good, with an early
harvest an good crop. 1780, a good season, but not equal to the last. 1781, good
season and crop, but much shaking. 1782, a severe bad season in May and June;
hailstones of immense size fell in some places; frost in harvest, a complete failure in
the crop. There are no distinct notes from this time till 1799, which was a very bad
reason, with a poor late crop; meal 2s. per peck, potatoes Sd. the small peck, and buy
Is. 4d. per stone.  At the end of the following year, 1800, oatmeal was 3s. perpeck,
pease-meal, 2s., potatoes, 10d. small peck, bay, 1s. 9d. per stone. There was a great
failure of the crops all over Britain, attributed to the great drought of the summer.
In 1801, there was the best seed-time in the memory of man-the year throughout,
was good, with a plentiful crop of every kind, and an early dry harves.  The first
eight months of the year 1802 were the worst in remembrance; the four last were
fine; a late but plentiful crop, and all well got in. There was plenty of grain on the
acre, but it did not meal so well as last year; beef 1s. per pound, mutton 9d., butter
1s. 5d., cheese 9d., eggs per dozen 1s. 3d., peck loaf 3s. 2d., oatmeal 1s. 3d., pots-
toes, a poor crop and watery, 1s. per peck. In 1803, a good crop, dry harvest, grain
plentiful, oatmeal 1s. 4d. per peck. The last seven months of 1804 all good weather,
with the best crop, full and ripe, and well got in, that occurred since 1801, oatmeal
1s. 5d. per peck.  In 1805, meal at same price, a plentiful crop of every kind.  In
the harvest of 1806 there was a great drought, followed by a wet November and De-
cember, corn, beans, and potatoes were all got in in fine order. 1807, a poor crop,
oatmeal 2s., hay 2s., pease, beans, and potatoes bad; 1808, a fine crop, well got in;
potatoes, pease, and beans above an average, altogether a remarkably fine harvest.
1809, a good harvest, grain plentiful, but high priced; oatmeal in June 2s. in July
1s. 1Od. per 1810, a beautiful warm sunny harvest; no rain from 3d Septem-
ber till near the end of October, the best harvest and wheat seed-time remembered;
barometer above fair for six weeks together; oatmeal 1s. 6d., potatoes 9d.  1811, a
great cornet appeared near Ursa Major on the 9th September, extraordinary rains,
frost, and winds in spring and beginning of summer, a medium crop. 1812, Crop
not all housed till the beginning of September, plentiful but dear; meal 2s. 4d. and
potatoes 1s. per peck. 1813, a good harvest, and a most excellent return of all sorts
of crops, meal 1s. 6d. potatoes 1s. per peck. 1814, a remarkably fine harvest, plenty
of grain, but little straw, roeat 1s. 5d. per peck, potatoes 9d. per peck of forty-two
pounds. 1815, a plentiful harvest all safely housed, oatmeal 1s. 8d. per peck, pota-
toes 9d., beef and mutton per stone 10s. 6d., skim cheeze 5d. and sweet milk cheeze
9d. per pound. 1861 was an uncommonly cold wet year, no sunshine; a poor crop of
every kind over all Europe, wheat L.3. 10s. per boll ostd L.2, barley L. 2, 10s.,
oatmeal 2s, per peck, quartern loaf 1s. 5d. 1817 was the worst crop ever known in
the west of Scotland; the month of August was particularly bad. 1818, a plentiful
crop of everv kind in Scotland, but a poor crop in the south-east of England, pota-
toes very pletiful, and of a fine quality; harvest began in early places on the 10th
of August; new oats and barley in the Falkirk and Haddington markets on the 13th of
August; oatmeal 1s. 5d, and potatoes 1s. the peck. 1819, trees early in leaf, but de-
stroyed by the frost early in June; no equinoxial blast in autumn; the longest set of dry
warm weather in September since I800; crop finished over all the country by the end
of the mounth,very plentiful and well got in; oatmeal 1s .2d.per peck. The Radical in
great commotion, especially towards the latter end of the year. 1820, harvest begun,
but not generally, by the end of August, and was bery generally finished by the end
of September. Upon the whole, a plentiful crop, and all safe. In November best beef
10s. 6d. per stone, oatmeal 17s. 6d. per boll, butter 1s. per pound, all very cheap.
