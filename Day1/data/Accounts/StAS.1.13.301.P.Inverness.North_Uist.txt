never was surveyed, nor divided into miles; but by allow-
ing a computed mile to be equal to a mile and a half mea-
sured, there can be no great mistake:  According to this
rule, the length of it, from the Sound of Bernera to the
island of Benbecula, in a straight line, will be 20 measured
miles, but 30 by following the ordinary tract that travel-
lers take.  The breadth of it varies, being in some places
18, and in others 12 miles.  Along the whole of the W.
coast, and round the N. end of this island, (being almost the
only parts of it that are cultivated), the country is low and
level for the most part for a mile and a half from the shore
to the moor.  In this part of the country the soil is sandy,
especially near the shore, and at some distance from it:  Be-
tween that and the moor is a thin black ground, covering
either a hard gravel, or solid rock, interspersed in some
places with flats and meadows.  The rest of the country
consists of a barren, soft, deep moor-ground, and mountains
of no great height, covered with heath.  The cultivated
part of the country, already mentioned, is extremely plea-
sant and beautiful in summer and autumn, yielding in fa-
vourable seasons the most luxuriant crops of barley, and the
richest pasture of white and red clover.  But, though in
the warm season of the year no country in the Highlands
can exhibit a more delightful prospect, yet in winter and
spring the scene is totally changed.  The face of the coun-
try then is quite naked and bare, there being no trees nor
high grounds to shelter it from the inclemency of the wea-
ther.  The grass is so soft and tender, that the winter rains
and snow take away its substance; so that cattle, during
these seasons, feed partly upon corn and straw, and partly
upon sea-weed, thrown in time of bad weather in great
quantities upon the shore.
