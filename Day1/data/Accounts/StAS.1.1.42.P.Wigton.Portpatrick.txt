     Statistical Account

is greatly to be attributed to the late Sir James Hunter Blair,
who happened to live at the critical period when the change
began.  He had sagacity enough to foresee the many advan-
tages which must result from it, and forwarded the projec-
ted improvements as much as possible, by filling the harbour
immediately with vessels, and building almost entirely a new
town, to accommodate the inhabitants and the travellers who
passed through it.  Such is the origin and the progress of im-
provement, which is generally owing, whether in a great ca-
pital like Edinburgh, or a provincial town like Portpatrick,
to the spirit and exertions of particular men, who seem born
for the purpose of rousing the multitude from a state of ig-
norance or torpor, from which they are too often unwilling
to be emancipated.

   Manufactures.-Manufactures have not yet made their
way to Portpatrick.  Ship-building is the only one as yet at-
tempted.  Under the auspices of the active and public spirited
citizen above mentioned, some companies of shipwrights have
been formed, who are likely to carry on that branch suc-
cessfully.  The depth of the water, and the shortness of the
run, render it one of the most convenient launches that can
be conceived.

   Commerce.-Both our exports and imports have greatly in-
creased.  We export here goods from Paisley, Manchester,
etc.; and we import considerable quantities of the Irish linen
manufacture.  The inhabitants of Portpatrick, however, are
generally only the carriers; the dealers are those who, not
being sufficiently opulent to freight and load large ships, car-
ry on a hauking business by land.  They bring their goods
in carts, and hire the Portpatrick vessels to convey them from
one shore to the other.
