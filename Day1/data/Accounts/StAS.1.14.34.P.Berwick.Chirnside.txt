ced angle of the latter, or where the bridge or cause-
way over either of them led to the castle, there was
often a sort (such as that known at Dunse, immediately
below the town, connected with the castle), called the
Bar-nay, or Barnekin.  Still more advanced, and, as
the rise of the ground favoured the position, stood the
tower of watch, overlooking the country around it, but
facing the quarter of the enemy.  It either stood single,
and was of a construction fit for some defense, or being

strong-house of some of the vassals, which therefore was
called, corruptly, the Peel, and properly, the Pile-house,

respected, they were frequently set on fire by the supe-

thicker and stronger walls, but lower, was erected the
bastile, or prison of the barony, or parochial district;
and, upon some eminence not far from it, was fixed the
grim and terrific spectacle of the gallows, or gibbet.
   In this parish, there is a place called Old Castles, hav-

buildings about it, which point it out as the site of the

bar, who joined to their title that of March, and were early, and often ap-
