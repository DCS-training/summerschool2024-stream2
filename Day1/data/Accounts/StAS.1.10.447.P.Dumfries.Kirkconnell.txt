Knockenstob, Cares, etc.  How long it is ago, since it ceas-
ed to be vernacular, cannot be ascertained; only, the English
language is now spoken here, as in the rest of Nithsdale, with
considerable purity, excepting chiefly a few old Scotch, or
rather obsolete Saxon words, that now and then occur; and
in a plain, easy, manly stile of pronunciation, without any
of those grating peculiarities of provincial accent, that mark
the dialect of some of the adjoining counties.  With the
small exception, of one from England, and another from Ire-
land, the inhabitants are all natives of Scotland.

   Diseases, etc.-Enjoying the advantage of an open situa-
tion, particularly a long and wide extended strath, which
forms the principal part of the parish, added to other circum-
stances formerly mentioned, tending to render the air pure
and salubrious; the people here are in general stout and heal-
thy, and usually free from epidemical distempers.  Even
when those have been raging in the contiguous parts of the
neighbouring parishes, here they have scarcely or not at all
appeared; at least, if they did, it was mostly in a milder form,
except in low confined places where the houses were damp
and ill aired, and accommodation in other respects perhaps
rather unfavourable for the patients.  For the same reason,
in part, it is to be feared, that the great increase of the
village, below the church, will be attended with a very ma-
terial change, as to salubrity, in that quarter of the parish;
as the site of it is low, flat, miry, and partly subject to a
land flood after heavy rains, especially in the months of au-
tumn and winter.  The diseases most common in this parish,
are, the rheumatism, asthma, and consumption, in adults
and the teething fever, the croup, chincough, and small-pox,
in children.  Of these in children the first three, perhaps
too the last, are greatly mitigated, or prevented, by the ear
