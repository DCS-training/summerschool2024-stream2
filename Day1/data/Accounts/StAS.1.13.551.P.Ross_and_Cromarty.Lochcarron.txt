     NUMBER XXXIV.

     PARISH OF LOCHCARRON,

     (COUNTY OF ROSS, SYNOD OF GLENELG, PRESBYTERY
     OF LOCHCARRON.)

     By the Rev. Mr LACHLAN MACKENZIE.

     Name, Extent, Soil, etc.

   Thisparish derives its name from a Loch or arm of
the sea, into which the river Carron falls.  Carron,
or Carambuin, which, in the Gaelic, signifies the winding
'stream;' takes its rise in the heights of the parish,from a
lake, called Loch Scavan.  A little above this loch, there 
are two burns; the one falls into Loch Scavan; the other 
goes to the burn of Lubgargan, and falls into the sea at
Dingwal.  It forms another loch at Bellanocra, within
4 miles of the sea.  In this loch, as well as in the other,
there is a small island, where MacIan, when propietor
of this part of Lochcarron, had a house and garden.  There
is a good salmon-fishing upon the Carron.  This parish is
bounded on the W. by the sea.  It is upwards of 14 miles
