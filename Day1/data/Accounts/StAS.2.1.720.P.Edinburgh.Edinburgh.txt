   In 1840, on the representation of the Prison-Board institut-
ed by Parliament for the regulations of the prisons of Scotland,
the Bridewell was incorporated with the Calton Jail; and se-
veral suggested improvements carried into effect. Work was
supplied to the prisoners and as great of degree of classification
and separation of prisoners was made as the nature of the building
would permit. The number of prisoners on the 1st October 1840
amounted to 481 criminal and 8 civil. The average number of
prisoners for the year 1841 was 463 criminal and II civil. The
average for 1842 was 530 criminal. The debtors and civil pri-
soners were removed at this time to the Canongate Jail, in order
to afford more room for the criminal prisoners.

   Canongate Tolbooth.-This is an old building of the time of
James VI., or perhaps earlier. It contains a court-room for the
courts of the baron bailies, and a debtor's prison for civil prisoners.
   Bridewell.-A House of Correction was established about the
year 1632 by the magistrates, for the reception of the vagrant poor
and vicious characters strolling about the streets of the city. As the
populations incereased a larger establishment of the kind was found
necessary; and, accordingly, in 1791, a grant of L. 3000 having been
obtained from government, and an act to assess the inhabitants
for the remainder of the requisite sum, from L. 5000 to L. 6000
more, the present Bridewell was founded. In five years afterwards
it was opened for the reception of culprits. The building,
which. stands on the south side of the Calton Hill, is of a semi-
circular form. It consists of five stories, the lowest of which is oc-
cupied with the kitchen and baths, the three above are divide into
cells, and the upper story contains the hospital and store rooms.
