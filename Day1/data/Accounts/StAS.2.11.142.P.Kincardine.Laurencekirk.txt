of Blackiemuir, and the formation of a new channel for the Lu-
ther, by the overflowing and stagnation of whose waters the marsh
is occasioned. It is understood that arrangements have been in
contemplation, with a view to this improvement; and were it ac-
complished, the whole district would be benefited, the hoar-frosts
would be in a great measure prevented, which so frequently rise
on these marsbds, and to a considerable distance injure the sur-
rounding crops, and much land, which at present is subject to be
flooded, and thus unfit for tillage, would be rendered of consider-
able value. The remainder of the waste ground in the parish
does not exceed 30 or 40 acres.
	"The great obstacles to improvement are felt chiefly in the
want of enclosures, of planting for the purpose of shelter, and of
sufficient and substantial accommodation in the farm-buildings.
There is no supply of proper building stone for dikes, and the
only substitute is hedges, yet, although the soil is well adapted for
the growth of thorn and beech, the farms are generally open and
unenclosed, and the whole district, though naturally fertile, pre-
sents rather a bleak appearance.
	"Although there are serious and well grounded objections to
throwing land into too great farms, yet there is a class of farms
that-are neither great nor small, varying from 100 to 130 acres,
commonly called four horse farms, which are objectionable in many
respects. Of this description a considerable part of the farms in
this parish consist. It would be perhaps better, that after the
croft of four acres, and the small farm of 40 or 50, there should
be no intermediate class, until the extent amounts to nearly 300
acres; of this class there are only three or four in the parish.
	Fross Produce.--"In order to ascertain the gross produce, it is
necessary to show how the 5000 arable acres which the parish
contains are cultivated.
