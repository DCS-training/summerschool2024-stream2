     Statistical Account

   "Dark, lurid, and stormy, the first three days of winter;
whoever would despair of the cattle, I would not till sum-
mer."
   The superstitious regard paid to particular times and sea-
sons, is not more prevalent in this country, than the belief
in the existence of ghosts.  On the sequestered hill, and in
the darksome valley, frequently does the benighted traveller
behold the visionary semblance of his departed friend, per-
haps of his enemy.  The former addresses him in the lan-
guage of affection; if danger is approaching, he is warned
to prepare against it, or the means of avoiding it disclosed.
By the latter, he is attacked with the vehemence of resent-
ment.  The inhabitants of this, and the visitant from the
other world, engage in furious combat.  For a while, the
victory is in suspense.  At lenght the ghost is overthrown,
and his violence appeared:  a few traits of his life upon earth
are described.  If he stole a ploughshare from his neighbour,
the place where it lies concealed is pointed out.  His anta-
gonist is requested to restore it to the owner; and if he fails,
punishment is threatened to follow the breach of promise;
for, till restitution be made, so long must the miserable cul-
prit be excluded from the regions of the happy*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*These illusions of fancy operate sometimes with such force, that severals
have died in consequence of them; and some have been deprived of their rea-
son.  Fragments of the speeches of ghosts are frequently recited; and like the
responses of the Grecian oracles, are generally couched in verse, especially the
more ancient fragments.  Two of these it may not perhaps be improper to cite
in the original.  The one is an apostrophe from a beloved wife, to soothe the
melancholy of a desponding husband.

     Na bidhea' (says she) ro ghaol, 's na bidhea' fuath,
     Agad air fluagh innis threud;
     Na smuanaigh air na chaidhe bhuait,
     'S chuid nach teachaidh bhuait, gun deid.
