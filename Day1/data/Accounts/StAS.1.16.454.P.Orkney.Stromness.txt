   Fuel.-As there are no peat-mosses in the parish of Sand-
wick, the inhabitants of that parish bring their peats from
the mosses of the neighbouring parish of Harray, distant
5 or 6 miles.  This employs them and their horses the
greater part of the summer, when, otherwise, they might
be employed in cleaning their lands, and preparing manure,
so that this distance from fuel is consequently a great bar
to improvement, either in the way of inclosing, fallowing,
or raising green crops.  The small mosses in the parish of
Stromness at present supply the parish; but it is probable
that, in 30 or 40 years hence, these mosses will either be
exhausted, or covered with water, so as to be inaccessible.
The inhabitants of the village of Stromness cut part of
their peats in the parish mosses; but the greater part of
this village is supplied with peats brought by sea from other
parishes, the distance of 5 or 6 miles.  The duty being
now taken off coals, the inhabitants of this village will pro-
bably use peats for their kitchen-fires, and coals for other
fires.
