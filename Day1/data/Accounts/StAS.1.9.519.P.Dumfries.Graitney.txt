   Springs, Rivers, Solway Frith, etc.-There are some mi-
neral springs; but as very little attention hath hitherto been
paid to them, their virtues are scarcely known, and they
are rendered less valuable by being often washed over by
the tides.  The Eden, Esk, and Sark, uniting form the head
of Solway Frith, and the southern boundary of this pa-
rish.  The Frith here may be 4 or 5 miles broad, and is
navigable to Sarkfoot for vessels of 120 tons burden.  There
are several harbours or landing places in the parish, such
as Sarkfoot, Hiedkirkpoint, Brewhouses, &c. but on any
part of the coast, which is a flat and sandy shore, vessels
may lie in safety at all times.  The Sark, and the Kirtle
another small river, are the only streams in the parish.  The
tides flow regularly from W. to E. with great rapidity, for
the space of 3 hours, and are nearly full at the moon's
southing.  The spring-tides rise about 20 feet above low
water mark, and there are evident appearances of their ha-
ving risen much higher at some former period.  In the
little rivers Sark and Kirtle are trout, eels, herlings, pike,
&c. but not in such quantities as to be objects of much at-
tention to the inhabitants.  The fishing, however, in the
Solway Frith is of more importance.  It produces salmon
in pretty large quantities, some sturgeon, cod, flounders,
and rarely porpoises.  But as the different methods employ-
ed in taking the several kinds of fish, the markets to which
they are sent, and the prices at which they are sold, are
fully and accurately detailed in the return from the adjoin-
ing parish of Dornoch, it is unnecessary to repeat them
here.
