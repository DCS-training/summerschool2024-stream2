of 30 fathoms, with 12 1/4 inch working barrels.  What the
late tacksman intended, is now carried into effect by the pre-
sent winning, which commands a very fine breast of coal in
both seams.  The lowermost seam is yet untouched with
this winning.  The main seam, now working, consists of

The roof conflicts of hard blue till, about 10 feet thick, above
which are strong posts of freestone, some of which are very
hard.  The other seam lies 10 fathoms deeper; it is said to
be a very fine coal, 7 feet thick, but has some small ribs of
stone in it.  The average out-put for the last four years is a-
bout 30 tons a-day, and so much is the case altered since 1743,
that there is a great demand, and the consumption is daily
increasing.  This coal dips to the E. at the engine, but to the
S. E., after passing a large hitch about 500 yards from the
engine pit, on the line of bearirng at the crop, the dip, or de-
clivity, is exactly a fathom in 3; but, in the dip workings,
only one fathom in 4 1/2; which gives ground to believe that it
will at last flatten altogether, and even crop out at the oppo-
site point of the compass, which, if the case, will make it a ve-
ry productive colliery.
