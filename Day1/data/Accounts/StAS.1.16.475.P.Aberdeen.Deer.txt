home-grown flax, is annually exported to the southern bo-
roughs.  In and near the villages of Stewartfield and Deer,
3000 yards of linens, checks, and linsey-woolseys, are every
year made for sale.  The Aberdeen merchants have been
long in the practice of giving out wool to be knitted into
stockings.  Spinning and knitting form the chief employ-
ment of the women; and a very considerable sum of mo-
ney is brought into the parish yearly from these sources.
A woman earns 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. a-week.
   In the year 1783, a bleachfield, and complete set of ma-
chinery, were erected by the late Mr Burnett of Denns, in
the neighbourhood of his village of Stewartfield. At pre-
sent, there are about 350 pieces of cloth, and about 600
spindles of yarn, bleached annually.  The Honourable
Board of Trustees, a few years ago, gave L. 30 Sterling for
erecting a drying-house.

   Minerals.-This parish abounds with springs of water.
On the farm of Mains of Anochie there are no fewer than
52.  There are besides a great many chalybeate springs in
the parish, some of which are very strongly impregnated,
and have been useful in stomachic and gravellish com-
plaints.
   There are quarries of limestone of a very good quality,
in different parts of the parish; some of which are reckon-
ed inexhaustible.  About 13,000 bolls of lime are made
annually, which sells at 6 d. or 7 d. per boll of 90 Scots
pints. 5000 or 6000 bolls of unburnt limestone are like-
wise sold to farmers, who burn it for themselves, at the
rate of L. 1, 5 s. for the hundred-boll-cairn, which contains
475 cubical feet.  From 60 to 70 hands are employed,
but not constantly, in the different parts of the work, who
are either paid by the piece, or receive 9 d. per day in
summer, and 7 d. in winter.
