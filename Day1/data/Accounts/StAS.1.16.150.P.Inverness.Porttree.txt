evening.  The best and most expeditious way of catching
the cuddie, when it is in greater plenty on the coast, is with
a sort of creel, called jabh.  The jabh commonly consists
of three or four strong rods, from 8 to 10 feet long, laid
across each other in the middle, and gently bent upwards,
till they are fixed at the ends to a large hoop, from four
to fix feet diameter, which forms its mouth: On the inside
it is all lined with a narrow net, made for the purpose to
retain the fish and to let out the water, tightly tied to
its ribs and mouth; and it has a long handle reaching its
bottom, where the rods cross one another, and to which, and
to the mouth, it is well fastened with a strong cord.  This
instrument the fisher, standing on a rock, presses down side-
ways into the sea, till the lower part of it reaches the bot-
tom, the mouth being nearly right above; then himself, or
an assistant, throwing out the bait in small bits over it, he
holds it firm in that position till it be all covered with cud-
dies, attracted by the bait, when he raises it up gently, and
often brings in many hundreds at a time.  The summer is
the best season for the larger sye, and the most common
method for fishing it then is this: A little before sunset
several persons go out in a boat; two, three, or four of
whom sit in its stern, each having a fishing-rod or two, fur-
nished with fine white or gray lines, and flies made of white
feathers, or hair on their hooks, which they hold out as far
as they can after the boat, while two more are rowing it
forwards; in this manner, till it becomes dark, they con-
tinue going backwards and forwards among the fish, which
always pursuing the fly, and endeavouring to swallow it,
fix on the hooks in such quick succession, as keep the fishers
often constantly busy in taking them in.  Every farm on
the coast, of which there are 34 in this parish, has a boat
or two, and sometimes the far greater number of these are
out in search the of sye in the same evening.
