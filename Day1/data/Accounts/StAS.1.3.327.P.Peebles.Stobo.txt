cumference,and, at the centre,is between 6 and 7 feet below
the level of the adjacent plain; whether it is the effect of 
nature or of art, it is difficult to determine.  There is an-
other cavity near the largest cairn, which is much larger
than Pinkie's Hole, being about 140 paces in circumference;
but it is neither so deep, nor so regular in the formation,
having a small ridge in the middle of it.  There are also,
upon the muir, a few small circular appearances, which are
evidently the effect of art.  The Sheriff Muir is the place
where the Tweeddale militia met.  It was thought expedient,
whilst the unfortunate animosity subsisted between the sister
kingdoms, that each county should embody a  militia, who
were summoned to appear before the sheriff-depute on a cer-
tain day, and at an appointed time and place.  This muir be-
ing both  centrical for the county, and well adapted for mus-
tering the militia, was the place appointed by the sheriff for 
that purpose; hence it was called the Sheriff Muir, and still
retains the name.

   Slates.-There are two seams of slate in one hill, nearly of
equal quality, which must have been wrought for many ages
past, as the oldest houses, in the district of country, to which
they have been carried, are covered with them.  The slates
are of a dark blue colour,split to a proper thickness,and,for
durability, and strength in proportion to their thichness, are
belived to be inferior to no slate whatsoever, as  no decay is 
observed in the slates of the oldest houses covered with them.
The seams of slate having been long let, with a large farm in
which they are situated, little attention was given by the te-
nant to the working of them, and the country was ill served
with them; but the quarries are now wrought, to a great ex-
tent, by the present proprietor, and his lessees, and the slates
are said to be much improved in size.
