                  PARISH OF DUNNET.
          PRESBYTERY OF CAITHNESS, SYNOD OF SUTHERLAND AND
                  CAITHNESS.
         THE REV.  THOMAS JOLLY, MINISTER.

         I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.-The name Dunnet is apparently derived from the
Gaelic Dun, signifying hill.  The names of many places in the
parish are, however, of Danish extraction, as Ratter, Syster,
Reaster, Sunzigoe, Ashigoe, Getterigoe, &c.
  Extent,&c.- The form of the parish is very irregular, its great-
est length being about It miles, its greatest breadth 6, and the
narrowest point, from Dunnet to Brough, 2 1/2 miles.  It is bound-
ed on the north and  north-east, by the Pentland Frith ; on the
east and south-east, by the parishes of Canisbay and Bower; on
the south, by those of Bower and Olrig; and on tbe south-west
and west, by Olrig and Dunnet bay.
   With the exception of Dunnnet-head, the whole parish may be
considered a  level distric, the elevations being trifling, and run-
ning in nearly parallel ridges, from north-east to south-west. The
highest point of Dunnet-head rises about 500 feet above the level
of the sea,-the average height of the parish above that level does
not exceed 150 feet.
