an opposite nature caused a great increase of the population. Mr
Speirs erected a large cotton factory, which required many
hands; and, to accommodate this new population, a village was
built, which now contains about 650 souls. In consequence of
this, the population is now nearly double that of 1791.

This population is disposed of as follows: families, 203. Of
these 24 families are employed in agriculture; 131 in trade,
manufacture, &c.; 48 families not employed in any of the above
ways.
                      IV.-INDUSTRY.
  Agriculture and Rural Economy.-This parish contains about
12,800 imperial acres of land. Of these, about 1000 acres are
arable; considerably upwards of 100 are under wood; and the rest,
hill and moor pasture.
  Bent of Land.-The arable land low down in the valley, on
the banks of the Endrick, lets at L.3 per acre. Cows. are grazed
on such land for L.4; on hill pasture for L.2. The rent of the
whole parish is L.3822. The annual value of the real property
in Fintry, as assessed in April 1815, was L.4126.
  Rate of Wages.-Labourers' wages are Is. 8d. per day; me-
chanics 3s. 6d.; tailors, Is. 6d. with meat. Farm-servants ge-
nerally live in the farmer's house; their wages are from L.1O to
L.20 per annum. Women servants have from L.6 to L.8 per
annum.
  Husbandry.-Oats and barley are the staple grains, though the
produce is far from equalling the consumption. There may be, at an
average, about 840 bolls of oats; barley, somewhat more than a third
of that quantity annually. The late Mr Speirs gave his tenants
good houses and farm-steadings. The Duke has begun to do so
in his barony, in a very superior style. A house and farm-steading,
lately erected in the upper part of the parish, cost, it is believed,
nearly L.1000. New farm-houses are very much wanted.
  Grazing.-Stock of sheep and cattle chiefly occupies the at-
tention of the farmer. On this, he depends for the payment of
his rent. The parish is well calculated for such kind of farm-
ing. It possesses very superior pasture, and is conveniently situat-
ed for the great cattle and sheep-markets, Falkirk, Balgair, &c.
