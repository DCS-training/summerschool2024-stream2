1. Oats; 2. Summer-fallow; 3. Wheat; 4. Pease; 5. Bar-
ley, with grass-seeds; 6. Hay.  In other farms the follow-
ing rotation is observed: 1. Oats; 2. Turnip; 3. Oats or
barley; 4. Pease; 5. Barley with grasses; 6. Hay; and
sometimes pasture the seventh year.  Potatoes are planted
generally in some corner of a field in grain crops.  Ten re-
turn of oats is not an uncommon produce.  The turnip
crop is found to be precarious, but is believed to be very
useful.  In some portions of ground here the oats do not
degenerate.  These may be called permanent soils; and
wherever found, ought to be chemically analized, that their
qualities and proportionable mixtures may be ascertained.
By arriving at this knowledge, farmers will have it the
more readily in their power to rectify their soils, and bring
them to an high degree of perfection.  The Cupar-Grange
or Angus oats are most commonly sown; and they not un-
frequently give meal for corn.  The rent of land has risen
greatly in the space of a few years.  In general it is at least
doubled since the year 1770.  Some land is let at L 3 per
acre, Scotch, yearly, on a lease of seven years; a great deal
is let at 40 s. or two guineas an acre.  Top-dressing on the
sward, for being ploughed up next spring, is a very com-
mon practice.  It is a prevailing maxim here, that land
top dressed with lime only, or lime and a mixture of earth,
should not be ploughed until the lime has taken a firm grip
of the ground.  Experience has taught, that by this method
the lime is not only kept from sinking too deep, but is also
mixed more intimately with the soil, than were it ploughed
in immediately after it is laid on the land.  This parish is
supplied with four meal, two lint, and three barley mills,
Most of the land was formerly thirled to the mills at a con-
siderable high multure.  But these servitudes were found to
be real grievances, and therefore were mostly bought up by
