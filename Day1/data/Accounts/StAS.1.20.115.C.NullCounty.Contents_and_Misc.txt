   It may be proper also to inform the reader, that the preceding Tables re-
specting the state of Aberdeenshire, were rendered more perfect than could
have been expected, from the deficiency in several of the original return,
in consequence of some special queries having been circulated for that pur-
pose, amongst the clergy of that county, in December 1796, to which 67
answers were received; and from them the Tables, of populations, rent, &c.
were corrected.  Some differences which will appear between the numbers
in those Tables and in the Statistical volumes, may be attributed to the dif-
ferent periods at which the calculations were made

   Since the above was written, it appears, from "A General View of the
"State of Portugal,"   by James Murphy, printed in London, in one volume
quarto, anno 1798, that inquiries, both of a Statistical and Agricultural na-
ture, have been carried on in that kingdom, in consequence of an institution
entitle, The Royal Academy of Lubon.  In particular, it would seem, that
a number of premiums were offered and adjudged by that Academy, as far
back as the year 1783, for physical and economical descriptions of any district
or considerable territory, either in Portugal on its transmarine dominions*;
and that a number of queries were circulated amongst the farmers, in 1787,
on this judicious principle, that no system for the improvement of the coun-
try could with safety be adopted, without a previous examination into the ac-
tual state of the nation, in regard to population, industry, natural produc-
tions, commerce, public revenue, and national expenditures+.
   It is not stated how far this plan has succeeded, though it has been
carried on for several years; but it would appear, that no expence was
spared to accomplish it, and that it received the full support and protection
of Government.  It is the more creditable therefore for this county, that
such inquiries have been carried on so successfully, by the exertions of indi-
viduals.
