be preferable, as sheep could be more commodiously kept
within these; and surely it is a circumstance much to be
wished, that the breed of sheep were more encouraged here
than it now is.  Many of the people in the parish have
still an unreasonable aversion to inclosing, notwithstanding
its many obvious advantages.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-It is an advantage, that
the centre of the united parishes, lying at nearly an equal
distance from the market towns of Montrose and Brechin,
about 4 or 5 measured miles from either, there is found
a ready sale for grain poultry, butter, cheese, eggs, &c.
But then there is a disadvantage resulting to those of the
parish who have such articles to buy; because on account of
the demand at these towns, enhanced of late by a number
of monied men, who have settled in these places and neigh-
bourhood, there is no article of provision can be purchased
within the parish, but at a very dear rate, and even higher
than in the above market towns.  There is likewise a tem-
porary disadvantage, which those especially of the poorer class
are beginning to feel: The coal has here, for a considera-
ble time, been the principal article of fuel, yet the common
people have in a good measure likewise depended partly on
furze and broom, and partly on turf and peat.  The furze and
broom begin to fail, as most of the wastes, from whence
these were procured, are either inclosing or converting
into corn ground.  The article of turf becomes still scarcer,
as the moors from which that was got, are now for the
most part inclosed and planted, and the low country mosses
which furnished peat, become every day more and more
exhausted, so that in a few years a total failure of them
may be apprehended; and as to peats from the hills, the
distance from hence, which is 10 or 12 miles, part of it
very steep and disagreeable roads renders it extremely diffi-
