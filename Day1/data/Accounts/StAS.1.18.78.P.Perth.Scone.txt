     Statistical Account

   Villages.-There are a number of villages.  Four of the
more populous contain from 55 to 70 souls.  Scone is the
most remarkable.  It stands in a plain relatively high except
on the east; and, though sheltered, is sufficiently airy and
healthful.  It consists of 2 streets and several lanes, one of
the streets, being remarkably wide, serves for a market place.
A considerable part of it has been either built or rebuilt with-
in the last 10 years.  The new houses are substantial and
neat; and many of them contain several families.  The
number of souls in the village is 466.

   Stormont-field Bleach-field.-This place, presently possessed
by Messrs Thomas and John Barland, had its name changed
from Colenhaugh, to Stormont field, in honour of the pro-
prietor, the Earl of Mansfield, formerly known by his title
of Viscount of Stormont.  It is situated on the Tay, exactly
opposite to Luncarty, and in a pleasant field, along the side
of the river, consisting of about 130 acres.  A canal, about
3 miles in length, and 18 feet in breadth, cut, at a very
great expence, through steep banks of the Tay, rock-made
and whin stone, always furnishes it with an abundant supply
of excellent water from the river.  A small canal also from
the brook of Inverbuist, affords an occasional supply; and the
bleaching grounds are of a fine dry soil, and have an excellent
exposure.  Adjoining to the bleaching-miln, is a miln for
spinning cotton, upon a small scale.  The house for the ma-
chinery, is a large structure, substantially built, of free-stone,
and noble in its appearance.  Some of the other houses are
elegant; and all of them remarkably neat and commodious.
   Besides the fall of water, which, at present, drives three
wheels, there are likewise three other separate falls; one of
eight feet, and two of four, equal, by the command of water,
