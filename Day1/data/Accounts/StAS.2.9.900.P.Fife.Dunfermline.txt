   sence two elders conduct public worship, and dispense the sacra-
   ments. They meet at present in a room in Horsemarket Street.
   The pastor has no fixed salary, but provision is made for him,
   partly from funds contributed by the united body, in aid of weak
   congregations.
     Roman Catholic Congregation, founded in 1823.  Having no re-
   sident priest, they meet in the dwelling-houses of two of their
   members, who conduct the usual services, but of course do not
   perform mass.

   tings, 342 in the low area, and, if fitted up with galleries, about
   500.  Present stipend, L.100.  Rev. T. B. Field, admitted De-
   cember 1841.

      The stipends of the Dissenting ministers are dependent upon

      The population of the parish, as taken in March 1836, and re-
   ported to the Religious Instruction Commissioners, without chal-

                                                               _______
                                                  Total,      17,286

	Since that period, great changes have taken place; but, from
   an ecclesiastical census taken by me in 1841, according to the
   Government census of that year, and from information recently
   obtained, I think the following may be regarded as at least an
   approximation to the present number of persons, of all ages, be-
   longing, to the different religious denominations:-
	Establishment,	                              4000*
	Free Church,	                              2500
	United Secession,	                      8000
	Relief,            	                       700
	Baptist-James' Street and Inglis' Street       300
	- Maygate,
	Episcopalians,	                               160
	Congregationalists,	                       430
	Rowites,	                                40
	Roman CathoIics,	                       100
	Swedenborgians,                         	60

    <FOOTNOTE>Calculated from the number of those who declared themselves in 1841 connected
    with the Establishment, after deducting about 1600, as mere nominal adherents, put
    into the class of " Not known," &c, and 2500, stated to belong to the Free Church.
