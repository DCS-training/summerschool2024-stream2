would be much better dissolved by the operation.  Even
some farmers have proposed to powder the burning lime-
sbells, instead of slacking them, to answer this purpose more
effectually.
   All black loam, sand, or any kind of earthy substance
almost, proves to be very good manure for clay; from its
lessening its tenacity upon being mixed with it, and by
that means brings a greater quantity of its prolific parts
into action; and clay carried to poor soil, or to mossy
grounds, proves a very useful manure.

   Marl.-Marl has also been tried on clay, but without ad-
vantage.  It answers well upon lighter lands, as far as 50
bolls (a cube of two feet each) per acre; and in much less
quantity, it makes an excellent top-dressing for grass.

   Composts.-Composts are not much in use in this parish.
But dunghills have been made up of different materials,
such as, earth, rubbish from old houses, dung from the
straw-yard, and, in some few instances, lime, rubbish, or
marl; but the practice is not general, and as yet it is not
confirmed by experience.

   Dung, Hints to Landlords-Dung never should be per-
mitted to go off the farm.  The straw now, since threshing-
mills came into general use, is fit for fodder or dung only.
The incoming tenant should have leave to sow grass seeds
in i-6th of the farm, without any claim or demand by the
outgoing tenant.  If the landlord gives him leave to fell
his last crop upon its foot, i. e. standing corn and fodder, he
should be obliged to sell it by public roup (auction), that the
incoming tenant, or any one on the barony, may have an op-
tion of buying it if they please.  If he choses to thresh it out,
it should be done on the farm, and the fodder either sold by
public roup, or to the incoming tenant by appraisement.
It would be an excellent regulation, if every new tenant
