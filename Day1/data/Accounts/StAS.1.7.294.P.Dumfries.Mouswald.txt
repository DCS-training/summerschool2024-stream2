but little pasture, and a small spot of moor on the N. E.
quarter of the parish, which is the highest ground in it, and
which still remains in a state of nature, and on the summit

is a part.

   Wood and Wild Animals.-There are some thriving natural
woods, the property of Sir Robert Grierson of Lagg, on the
north quarter of the parish; and several acres have lately
been planted by that gentleman, with different sorts of fir
and other forest trees.  There is also a small piece of natural
wood, consisting of oak and ash, on a farm on the south
side of the parish, lately purchased by the Viscount of Stor-
mont.-The wood-lark, bullfinch, and most of the other
kinds of birds common to the south of Scotland, are to be
found in the woods.  It is said there are numbers of the
golden-crested wrens seen here.  In the moss there are the
bittern, snipe, moorsowl, and curliew.  Some black game
have also been seen.  Plenty of wild ducks hatch here, and
abundance of wild geese in hard winters.  Woodcocks are
also found here in winter; and the swallow, cuckoo, field-
fare, green and grey plovers, in their seasons.  Polecats,
commonly called fumarts, abound here; and there are num-
bers of foxes; both of which, particularly the latter, make
great havoc among the poultry.

   Rivulets.-There are no rivers in the parish, Lochar, as

take their rise in the higher grounds, and run into Lochar.
It has also plenty of fine spring wells.  St Peters, about 100
yards west from the church, is one continued spring for 30
