are the lime quarry at Tomphobuil, and a sort of freestone quarry,
of a bluish colour, upon the Aird of Appin. In order to accom-
modate the tenants, the former is let at a nominal rent, and it
supplies this and the neighbouring parishes with excellent lime,
both for architectural and agricultural purposes; and the latter
furnished most of the hewn materials required by the recent ad-
dition and improvements at Castle Menzies.
  Fisheries.-There are no fisheries in Dull, excepting wh`t there
is of salmon-fishing upon the river Tay, and that is retained by
the heritors whose respective properties border therewith in their
own hands. Of late years, they have been far from successful, in
consequence, it is supposed, of the distance from, the sea, and the
many obstacles which the fish have to encounter in their progress
thitherward.
  Raw Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce rais-
ed in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, may be thus
stated, viz.

   Manufactures.-There was a carpet manufactory established
some years ago at Camserney, by Sir Niel Menzies, Bart., a
gentleman who deserves well of his country, and who cannot be
too highly spoken of for his laudable and assiduous exertions in
promoting every species of improvement connected with mecha-
nics and agriculture. This manufactory has hitherto been attend-
ed with considerable success. It affords employment to between
20 and 30 hands, and has an annual consumption of about 600
stones of wool.
   Situated near the above manufactory, and upon, the same
stream, there is a saw-mill, and a whell,wright-mill, which has
