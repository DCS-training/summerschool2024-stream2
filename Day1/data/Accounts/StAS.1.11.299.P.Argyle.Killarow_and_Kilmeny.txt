river Luggan, where there is a salmon fishing, is one of the
largest in the district, emptying itself into a bay of the same
name, in the S. corner of the parish.  The river of Killarrow
runs a great way in the country, and empties itself into the
bay or harbour of Lochendaal, which harbour runs from the
Mull of Islay and the Runn's Point, about 12 miles, to Shaw-
field's pleasure grounds.  It is an excellent harbour for shipping,
is very much resorted to, and of late more than ever; as the
proprietor has lately built a fine quay at the village of Bow-
more, which will contain many vessels from 8 to 10 feet wa-
ter.  The harbour abounds with all forts of fish; and, in good
weather, the inhabitants, with small boats, supply themselves
abundantly.  Salmon sells at 1 1/2 d. per pound; when dearest,
at 2 d. per pound.  As every farm round Lochendaal has a
boat of its own, fish are in no great demand, nor is there a
market convenient*.

   Soil, Produce and Cultivation, etc.-The soil varies in most
of the farms.  The farmers plow too much ground.  The
average produce of oats is, from 3 to 4 returns, of barley from
4 to 5; but where marl and lime, or shell sand, are easily
obtained, and the lands are drained, the increase is much
greater.  Mr. Campbell has improved large tracts of moor
ground, within view of his own house, which lies about 3
English miles from the village; and, from his method of cul-
tivation, they have produced large crops.  He spares neither
pains nor expence; and in this respect several of his te-
nants attempt to imitate him.  It is computed that he lays

*About 20 years ago, some gentlemen adventurers from Liverpool, fitted
out 3 smacks, with wells, and caught great quantities of cod and ling at the
Head Lands, which supplied the Liverpool markets abundantly; but the bad con-
duct of the persons employed obliged them to give it up.
