neral a bleak rugged appearance; the cultivated soil, how-
ever, in the valleys, and on the sides of hills, and the
several falls of water in the rocky channel of the rivulets,
have formed some beautifully diversified scenes.  The un-
cultivated soil consists of moor and peat moss, with some
interjacent plots of green pasture.  The arable land in ge-
neral is sandy, shallow, stony and steep, lying either on a
bed of rock, or of compacted gravel.  Some fields contigu-
ous to the Lossie, consist of loam either upon a clayish or
sandy bed.  Several plots of a mossy and moory nature are
to be found both among the high and low lands.

   Rivulets, etc.-The parish is adorned with the three ri-
vulets of Lennock, Burden and Rushcroock, which flow in-
to the river Lossie.  The Lossie taking its rise in the parish
of Edinkillie, and gliding through Dallas, begins at its con-
fluence with the burn of Lennock, to run by part of the
west side, and then through the north end of this parish,
and after a course of about 18 miles from its origin to its
mouth, flows into the sea at the harbour of Lossie mouth.
The river abounds in barn trouts and eels.  Some salmon,
finnacs*, and white trouts swim up the river about Lam-
mas, which give fine diversion to the angler.  The moil
remarkable inundations happened in the years 1768 and
1782.  Three-fourths of the farm of Over-bogs have been
destroyed by land floods, which have hurled from the hills
an immense quantity of stones and sand, and left them upon
that plain field, where the river sometimes parts into two
or three streams.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Finnacs are a species of fish in colour and shape like a salmon.  They
weigh flom 2 lb. to 4 lb.  White trouts are of a less size, but of a whiter
colour.  They are supported to be two species of sea trouts.  In April,
shoals of the fry of each species swim down to the sea, from which they
do not return sooner than July.
