in breadth, on which is represented the figure of a salmon above
a distinctly described arch.  As the salmon was held sacred by
the Druids, it is highly probable that this emblematical represen-
tation was connected with the ceremonies of their worship.  A
broad smooth stone, of about 5 feet in length and 3 in breadth,
likewise formed part of the old wall of the burying-ground at Clatt,
on which are engraven several single and concentric circles, and
other figures representing barbed arrows.  This stone is similar
to many in different parts of the county, on which are described
circles and hieroglyphic characters, which are generally believed
to refer to the ages of Druidism.

                     III.-POPULATION.
   There exist no data by which the population of this parish at
an early period can be fixed with accuracy.  Were we, however,
to form an estimate from the average number of births at two cor-
responding periods of the last and present century, we should be
led to conclude that the population is considerably on the de-
crease.

<TABLE>
   The average number of births for seven years, from 1725 to 1731, was 16
                                                      1825 to 1831, was 12

                        1821,       - 283   -    268     -   551
	                  1831,       - 280	  -    255     -   535

   The decrease of population since the commencement of the
last century may be ascribed to the removal of several families
into the manufacturing, districts during the period of commercial
prosperity, and the consolidation of crofts into farms of moderate
extent.  Where clusters of cottages at one time flourished, there
scarcely now remain any vestiges to point to their former site.
By the present arrangement of the size of farms, the population
has settled into a deficient state, which does not correspond with
the exigencies of the parish, and upwards of eighty servants from
other districts are annually required to supply the deficiency, and
to carry on the cultivation of the soil. The village of Clatt con-
tains about 90 inhabitants, or above one-sixth of the whole popu-
lation of the parish.
