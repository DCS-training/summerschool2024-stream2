but though his cell was in Colonsay, he seems to have been
revered in Oronsay, which is so called after his name.  Co-
lon, who seems to have had no cell in either of the islands,
was lucky enough to have his memory preserved, by giving
his name to Colonsay.

   Situation, Extent, and Surface.-This western division of
the parish, being considered as one island, has Mull on the
N., is washed by the Atlantic on the W., and stretches across
the sound of Ilay on the E.; from which circumstance, it is
called descriptively, Eilean Tarsuing, or the Cross-lying Island.
Ireland is the next land to it on the S.  It is a flat island,
when compared with the towering peaks of Mull and Jura
in its neighbourhood.  The surface, however, is very un-
equal; there is a considerable number of rugged hills, cover-
ed over with heath.  This division of the parish has been sur-
veyed, and found to measure about 8000 acres, of which a-
bout 3000 are said to be arable.

   Air, Climate, Soil, etc.-The temperature of the air, and
the climate, are nearly the same as in Jura.  The inhabitants
are robust and healthy; they live in the same simple manner
with their brethren in Jura, and have neither lawyer nor sur-
geon in the island.  The soil is generally light; along the
shores it is sandy, but more fertile, and not so stony as that
of Jura.  Barley and potatoes are more productive crops here
than oats.  Artificial grasses have been tried, and are found
to answer.  The sea-weed, of which there is great abundance
for kelp and manure, has been tried with success upon mea-
dow ground.  When the surface is quite covered with it in
winter, a dissolution and incorporation with the soil takes
place, the natural clover and finer grasses are encouraged to
shoot up, and a most luxuriant crop follows.  The pasture
