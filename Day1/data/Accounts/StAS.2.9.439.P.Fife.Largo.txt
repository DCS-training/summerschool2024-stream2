in Britain, and a few in Denmark. On a rising ground to the
north, called Norrie's Law, several antiquities in silver were dis-
covered, together with a number of small silver Roman coins,
bearing the stamp of the earlier emperors. They are now in the
possession of General Durham. On the property of Balhousie,
about forty years ago, were found, deposited eighteen inches be-
neath the surface, three earthen vases containing ashes, and near
them some rude stone coffins, and the bones of a child.

          The population amounted in 1755,  to  1396

  The population formerly employed in sea pursuits, salt-works,
and collieries, in the south, has no doubt been diminished; but the
deficiency is far more than counterbalanced by the greater number
of bands employed in the cultivation of the land, in manufactures,
and in collieries in the north.


    Of the whole, there may be considered as residing in villages,   1761

  It is to be regretted, that, from the registration of births not be-

  There is nothing peculiar in the language or manners of the in-
habitants. It argues well for their prudence and management,
that with wages, as frequently happens, not exceeding 6s. or 7s.
