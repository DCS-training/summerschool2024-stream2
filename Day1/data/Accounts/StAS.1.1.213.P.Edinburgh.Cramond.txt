     of Cramond.

cwt. of nails, and 1000 dozen of spades, are annually made;
and a file manufacture has been lately established.  These
three branches employ about 50 men and boys, who make
from 3 s and 20 s. per week.  Much steel is exported from
hence to India; and the greatest part of the rod iron made
here is sent to Stirlingshire, where the Cramond company
employ above 200 men to manufacture it into nails, of which
larg quantities were, before the late war, exported to Ame-
rica.

   The iron used at the Cramond works comes chiefly from
Russia and Sweden, upwards of 1000 tons being imported
from the Baltic yearly.  The average cost per ton (including
customs at 56 s. and freight from 8 s. to 15 s.) is L. 17 for
Russia, and L. 18: 10: 0 for Swedish iron; but a very fine
kind of the latter, the produce of the famous mine of Danne-
mora in Upland, called Oeregrund's iron, from the port where
it is shipped, comes to L. 24 per ton.  This sort is used solely
for making steel.  These different kinds of iron are 50 per
cent. dearer than they were in 1780, which rapid advance
has lately induced the proprietors to erect furnaces at clyde,
near Glasgow, with the view of making bar iron for Cra-
mond, which they hope will, in a few years, furnish them
with sufficient materials, and save the great sums remitted
for that article The Cramond works are supplied with coal
from the Grange, near Borrowstounness, a property of the 
Messrs Cadells, and they annually consumed about 1600 tons,
which are brought in sloops for 1s 6 d. per ton freight; prime
cost and other charges may be about 7 s.  The forge ham-
mers weigh from 4 to 6 cwt. each, are wrought by water,
and make from 120 to 160 strokes in a minute.  These ham-
mers, and other cast iron articles used here, are made at the
Clyde furnaces.
