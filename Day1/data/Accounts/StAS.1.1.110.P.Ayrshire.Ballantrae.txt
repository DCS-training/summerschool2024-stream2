   Price of Provisions.-Though the price of provisions is
greatly increased within these 20 years, it cannot yet be said
to be high.  Beef, mutton, lamb, and pork, (of which last
there is a great deal more reared than used in the parish)

stone; hens 6 d.; chickens 2 d.; eggs 2 d. a dozen; skim-
med mile chesse 4 s. a stone, Scots weight (24 oz. to the lb(;
butter 10 s. 8 d ditto, of which there is not a great deal
sold, as the practice of smearing their sheep with tar and
butter before the winter sets in universally prevails over all
the country.

   Church.-The living of Ballantrae is L. 500 Scots of mo-
ney and three chalders of victual, with a house and glebe

the manse in 1736, and the repairs upon the manse and offi-
ces since that time has cost the heritors little more than L. 20
Sterling.
