     of Kincardine.

Invercharron one.  There is a yair at Kincardine, which pro-
duces a small rent to Sir Charles Ross.  He furnishes wood
for standards and saplings.  His tenants in the neighbour-
hood are obliged annually to repair the yair, and have the
small fish for their trouble.  The salmon belongs to the
master, or to th tacksman.  The small fish are of several
kinds, some of which have no names, but such as the natives
invent for them.  Early in the season, great shoals of that
species of fish, known in England by the name of white bait,
come up.  They grow to the size of achovies, and are
thought to be what are found in the harvest months, (resem-
bling the small winter herrings), found in the Bays of Cro-
marty and Inverness.

   It is worthy of remark, that during the great scarcity in
1783, these fish came up in such astonishing quantities, as to
contribute very much to the support of those who fished the
yair, as well as of many families from the neighbouring
county and estates, who were invited to share the boun-
ties of providence in that season of distress.  Sturgeon is also
found in the yair.  The incumbent has seen a large one ta-
ken from it, that measured 13 1/2 feet.  The country people,
thinking it of service to their cattle in certain diseases, carry
it home, and preserve it in their houses.  Prawns, small rock
and ware cod, gurnet, turbot, and padles are found; but for
the last 3 years, all the small fish have decreased very much,
except slounders.

   Ferries.-There are 5 ferries; one at Bonar, where the Car-
ron runs into the Firth; one on the river Carron, a mile
above the Firth; one at Culrain; one at Tighniriver, and
one at Ochtow.  The 3 last facilitate the communication be-
tween the counties of Ross and Sutherland.
