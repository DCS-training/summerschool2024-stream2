cimens, if polished by the lapidary; and it is thought abundance
of the metal cannot be far from being discovered.
	The soils of this parish are almost of every description. On
the banks of the Kelvin, Luggie, and Bothland, and other stream-
lets, the soil is to a certain extent alluvial. We have next a very
light sandy soil in many places, upon deep water-laid gravel.
There is, thirdly, in several places a soil a little more earthy, form-
ed chiefly of the whinstone rock. Fourthly, We have a deep
black soil, nearly allied to, and perhaps chiefly composed of, moss.
Fifthly, There is a thin mossy soil mixed with white sand. Last-
ly, we have, on by far the greater part of the parish, a deep stiff
tilly soil, containing scarcely a stone, but generally tinged with iron
for many fathoms, until we arrive at some mineral or metal. We
have, moreover, eight or nine mosses, some of them of great depth
and extent. Some have already been reclaimed, and they are all
gradually, and some of them rapidly, lessening by peat-cutting,--so
that oats, rye-grass, and even wheat, grow luxuriantly, where the
adder basked, the moorfowl fed, and the long heath waved.
