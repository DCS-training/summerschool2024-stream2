   starts and strangers, and to exclude the most wealthy and
respectable of their burgesses.  It is this narrow system of
municipal and political government, which is so irksome to
the inhabitants of many burghs is Scotland; which fours
their minds, and dispose them to listen with greedy ears
to pretended plans of reform in the constitution, however
remote their connection may be, with redress of any
real grievances they have to complain of.

   And yet, after all, such a change ought never to be at-
tempted, till it has been calmly considered, whether or not
such an attempt may produce greater evils, than those that
are complained of.  For when it is considered, that to pro-
mote the virtue and happiness of the people is the object of
Government, and that their liberty, both political and civil,
is sufficiently secured by the fundamental laws of the
realm, without exposing them to all the license and debau-
chery of popular elections, a wife patriot will be patient
under partial evils, and cautious in seconding plans of re-
form, which are not necessary to the security of freedom,
and may tend to the corruption of the people.

   Upon the whole, next to virtue and good morals, the
comfortable state of this community depends on the prospe-
rity of the capital, with which it is so much connected, and
on the disinterestedness and activity out their funds in useful
improvements.
