grain.  The adventure has not only proved advantageous to
themselves, but highly beneficial to the neighbourhood.  The
farmer being enabled to deliver his grain in less than one half
the time which was formerly required, has it more in his
power to embrace a favourable season when it offers.  This
is of the utmost moment here, where the nature of the soil,
in many such, that it can only be plowed to ad-
vantage between wet and dry.  The short carriage, therefore,
gives them a decided preference above other merchants, who
greater distance, so that they purchase most of the
barley produced for many miles around, which they either
conven into malt, for the Norway market, or send to the
Frith of Forth.  From 3000 to 4000 bolls of grain are an-
nually exported

   Manufactures.-A manufacture of sail cloth has of late
been established in the town of johnshaven, by a Company
of Dundee merchants.  This affords employment at times to
about 50 men, besides a number of women.  To form a fair
opinion of any undertaking in its infancy is difficult, but
were the harbour improved, there is every probability that
this would succeed, as it would then labour under no local
disadvantage.
