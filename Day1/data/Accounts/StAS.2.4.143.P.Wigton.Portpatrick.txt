			PORTPATRICK.                       143

Airds in Ireland, is certainly unfounded. The same Viscount of
Airds, by whom the church of Portpatrick was erected in the years
1628 and 1629, is said, in the Montgomery manuscripts, p. 93, to
have bought this castle, as well as Portpatrick town, from Sir Ro-
bert Adair of Kinbilt, and to have put many convenient and hand-
some additions to it.
	Modern Buildings.--The greater number of the houses in the
town of Portpatrick are of very recent date. They are all built of
the stone quarried from the neighbouring rocks, and are generally
built substantially. The present mansion-house of Dunskey shows
a stone in the wall with the insbription "Perfected 1706." It re-
ceived a large addition about eight years ago, in the time of the
late proprietor, and has been greatly altered and improved by the
present proprietor.

                      III.--POPULATION.
	Within the remembrance of persons still living, and who are
upwards of ninety years of age, there were not more than ten
or twelve houses where the town of Portpatrick now stands. The
inhabitants of these houses probably did not exceed 100, whilst it
appears that about the same time the population of the whole pa-
rish amounted to 551.
	The following is an extract from the Statistical Account given
to Sir John Sinclair in 1791; "The return to the inquiries
made by Dr Webster regarding the population of the parish of
Portpatrick about forty years ago was 551 souls. It has since con-
siderably increased. It appdars from an enumeration recently
made, that there are in the country part of the parish 484, and in
the town, 512 souls, so that the whole population amounts to 996,
being an addition, in that space of time, of 445 souls."
	By the census taken in 1831, under direction of Parliament,
the whole population amounted to 2239. The following note has
been kept by the schoolmaster who made the return:

	Since 1831, the population has decreased in consequence of the
number of men having been reduced who were then employed in
constructing the new harbour. At present it amounts to 1991, of
whom there are in the town, 1010; in the country, 981.
