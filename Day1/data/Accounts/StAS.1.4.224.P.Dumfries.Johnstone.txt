     Statistial Account

they receive board and loding, and an hire proportioned
to their age, and the number of cattle they have to attend,
generally 12 s. or 14 s.  The average hire for ploughmen
is from L. 7, to L. 7, 10 s. a-year; for an half grown l ad
to drive the plough, thresh, etc. L. 5; female servants for
husbandry, L. 3, or L. 3, 10s.  There are but very few
servants kept solely for domestic purposes.

   Ruin.-The only ruin worthy of notice is the castle of
Lochwood, which was the residence of the family of An-
nandale.  It is situated in the north end of the parish, com-
mands a very extensive prospect, especially towards the
south, and is said to have been built in the 14th century.
It must formerly have been a place of great strength, ha-
ving had prodigiously thick walls, and being surrounded
by unpassable bogs and marshes.  It was this circum-
stance made King James VI. say, that 'the man who built
'Lochwood, though outwardly honest, must have been a
'knave in his heart.'

   Eminent Men.-This parish has the honour of having gi-
ven birth to Dr Rogerson, first physician to the Empress of
Russia.  His father was one of the Marquis's tenants, and
rented one half of the farms of Lochbrew, in the south end
of the parish, where the Doctor was born.  The other half
was at the same time rented by William Halliday, another
farmer, whose son, Dr Matthew Halliday, is likewise one
of her Imperial Majesty's physicians.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The inhabitants are rather
above the middle size; but I never heard of any of them
exceeding six feet two inches.  Their dress, diet, and
lodging, are much amended within these twenty, or even
ten years.  They seldom live beyond their income.
