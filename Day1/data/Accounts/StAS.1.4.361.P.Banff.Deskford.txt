to the industrious, and beautifies the face of the country,
but perhaps proves more lucrative to the landholder, than
an extension of property.  In the lower grounds, the soil
seems peculiarly adapted for the growth of planting; and
had the famous Dr Johnson directed his tour through
Deskford, and deigned to pull down the blinds of his car-
riage*, he would have seen many trees not unworthy of
attention from the most prejudiced English traveller.  In
an orchard adjoining to an ancient castle, there is particu-
larly an ash-tree, which measures in girth 24 feet 5 1/2 inches.
It is called St John's tree, from its vicinity to a chaper of
that name, to be afterwards mentioned.  There is another
ash in the same orchard, which measures in girth 12 feet
3 1/2 inches, having a shank 20 feet high, of nearly the same
dimensions.  This ash is called Young St John.  There is
also a holly tree, perhaps the largest of its species in this
country.  It measures, at the distance of 2 feet from the
ground, 8 feet 4 1/2 inches in girth.  In several places of the
parish, hedges have been planted; and they also thrive a-
mazingly, when they receive proper care and attention.-
There is a quarry of limestone at Craibstown, which yields
lime superior in strength and colour to any in the neigh-
bourhood.  It is consequently in great request, and affords
a profitable employment to many of the tenants, in sum-
er and autumn.

   Church, and ancient Castles.-There is no date upon the
church; one pew in it bears 1627, another 1630.  It is si-
tuated nearly in the centre of the strath, and, like the ge-
nerality of churches in this coutry, is gloomy and misera-
bly furnished.-Close by it is an old cattle, called the Tower
