bolls, Linlithgow measure, every year; all which is car-
ried to Dalkeith and Edinburgh markets.  Coal and lime
are brought home in return.-There are about 2000 sheep
kept in the parish.  The farmers also rear a considerable
number of black cattle every year.  Besides these, they
buy many in the autumn; which, with these of their own
that are of proper age, they fatten on turnips.  They are
now beginning to breed horses.  This will probably be the
means of lowering the price of that useful animal, which,
for some years past, has been very high.  Horses are abso-
lutely necessary in this part of the country, for it is by them
the farmers labour their farms, and drive their corn to
market.  They never work with oxen now, as they used 
to do formerly.-The most common crops in this parish
are oats, barley, and peas.  There is also some wheat every
year; but the quantity of it is small, in proportion to the 
other kinds of grain.  Turnips and potatoes are very gene-
ral, and commonly very good.  There is now a great
quantity of clover and rye-grass sown, and some flax for
private use.  The oats that grow on the grounds about
Fans, are much esteemed for feed.  In feed-time, they ge-
nerally fell for 3 s. or 4 s. a boll more than the other oats, and
there is usually a considerable demand for them at that
season.  Of late years the quality, both of sheep, black 
cattle, and horses, has been greatly improved, and their
numbers increased, owing to the improvements that have
been made in husbandry; and if the farmers continue
in the same spirit of improving their farms, which I hope
they will, there is not the least doubt but their black cattle,
horses, and sheep, will still improve, both in quality and 
number.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 5948: 13: 11 6/12
Scots.  There are about 40 proprietors in it, 3 of whom 
are freeholders; the others are all feuers or portioners.
