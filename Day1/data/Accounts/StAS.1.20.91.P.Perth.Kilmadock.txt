the clay; and, where this river joins Forth, one of these
trees, covered with the same depth of clay, projects near
20 feet, and the trunk is near 6 feet diameter.  Several
shells have likewise been turned up from the clay in this
carse.
   Moss Flenders (part of which belongs to this parish)
abounds with natural curiosities.  Some years ago several
logs were found in the moss, squared, and lying along each
other in the form of a float, and the marks of the ax was
visible on them.  Here also was found a piece of a ship.
A Roman causeway has also been discovered along the bot-
tom of the moss, running in a direction of south-east to
north-west; but these particulars belong more properly to
the account of the parish of Kincardine.

   Advantages.-From the preceding observations it is evi-
dent, that the parish of Kilmadock has many advantages.
1. It lies in the centre of Scotland, and has intercourse with
all the kingdom.  2. The two great roads pass through it.
3. It contains an excellent soil, affording scope for all man-
ner of agricultural study and research.  4. The climate is
healthful, mild, and friendly to cultivation.  5. It is expo-
sed to the fun, and defended by mountains on the north and
north-west, and there is easy access to all parts of the
grounds.  6. It abounds with natural springs, rivers, and
burns, and contains very fine situations for cattle in time of
storms.  It enjoys the waters of the Teith for a space of 10
miles, where multitudes of water machines can be erected,
and hence is well adapted for commerce and manufactures.
Above all, it commands a grand view of hill and dale, of
mountains and vallies; it has ample provision for its poor,
and is free of hospitals and all such mortifications; it enjoys
peace and contentment, and is not rent asunder by civil or
religious contests.
