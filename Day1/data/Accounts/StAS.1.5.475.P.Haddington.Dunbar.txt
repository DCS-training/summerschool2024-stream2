     of Dunbar.

of Whittingham ;-westward, are Dumbender Law, Garle-
ton Hills, and North-Berwick Law ; and on the N. the
Bass, the Isle of May, the Frith of Forth, the coast of Fife,
and the losty mountains of Angus.

   Soil.-The soil is rich, and the parish of Dunbar is per-
haps the most fertile spot in East Lothian, which is the
most fruitful province in North Britain.  It is partly a
rich loam, partly clay, and partly a light mould.  It is
well cultivated, and produces great crops, chiefly wheat,
barley and beans, but little oats, and less rye.  Rich crops
of broad clover and rye-grass are raised, and the land an-
swers well for turnips and potatoes.  Sea-ware is much
used for manure, and with good success.  Limestone is
got in the E. end of the parish, and there are draw kilns
for burning lime, which is used by the farmers, and sold
to those in the neighbourhood.  The fields are inclosed,
some with stone walls, some with thorn hedges ; and some
of them are still open.  The greater part of the land is
dry, and the seasons are early.

   Rent, Proprietors, etc.-The land is, in general, high
rented.  The burgh acres give from L. 4 Sterling to a-
bove five guineas the English acre, and considerable farms
from 30 s. to two guineas.  The land is divided among
7 great heritors, (of whom 3 reside in the parish,) and about
the same number of very small ones.  There are 30 great
farmers, who pay of rent from L. 60 to L. 600 Sterling.
They are generally opulent and respectable.  There are
7 or 8 small ones.  There is one grazier, who deals to a
considerable extent, in breeding and feeding for the but-
cher market.  A good many cattle are stall-fed, and sheep
are fattened with turnips.  The valued rent of the parish
is L. 16, 953 Scotch, and the real rent about L. 8000 Ster-
