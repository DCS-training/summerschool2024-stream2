			  RESCOBIE.     		605

to this date, November 1840, there have been seven ministers of
Rescobie, namely, Mr Patrick Lyon, who succeeded Mr David
Lindsay, and was ordained 23d December 1677, and died in Au-
gust 1703. Mr John Dougall, who was admitted 22d March
1704, and died 1st December 1723. Mr John Dougall, said to
be son of the preceding, who was admitted 15th September 1725,
and deposed about May 1748. Mr Robert Trail, who was ad-
mitted on the 21st July 1749, and translated to Panbride, Octo-
ber 1763. Mr William Key, who was admitted April 26th 1763,
and died September 1776. Mr Thomas Wright, who was admit-
ted on 3d April 1777, and died on 9th April 1808; and Mr
William Rogers, who was admitted on the 10th May 1809.
	From the session records it appears also, that there was a Mr
William Arthur presented to the parish, but not ordained. On
3d July 1748, an intimation is given of a meeting of Presby-
tery  "to be held at rescobie the 14th instant, and. then to  offer
Mr William Arthur, the patron's presentee, to the parish."  On the
14th, the Presbytery met according to appointment, but it is not
said what was done. The presentee, however, January 1749, an-
other meeting of Presbytery is intimated to be held on the 19th,
to make an offer of Mr Trail to the parish to be their minister.
	During the period alredy mentionedd, namely, from 1687 to
1840, it appears that there were 27 schoolmasters in this parish.
For a considerable time, they are spoken of as admitted to the of-
fice of reader and schoolmaster. And it appears that the Pres-
bytery were then accustomed sometimes to delegate their power
of deposition of schoolmasters to kirk-sessions; for, in a minute
of session, dated 2d February 1735, a Mr Walker is, according to
an act passed by the Presbytery to that effect, deposed by the
minister and session in the Presbytery's name.
        Antiquities.-there are two stones at Blackgate of Pitscandly,
concerning which there have been varios conjectures. Some have
imagined then to be rude monuments of distinguished cheift that
fell there in battle. Now Buchanan informs us that there was a
very bloody battle fought at Restenet betwixt the Picts and the
Scots, when Feredeth, King of the Picts, was slain. This battle
took place about the year 831, when Alpin was King of the Scota
Buchanan say's * "cruentissima pugma usque ad noctem incerta
victoria conflixerunt." Restenet is near to Pitscandly, which is
