     NUMBER VI.

     PARISH OF STONYKIRK

     (COUNTY OF WIGTON.)

     By the Rev. MR. HENRY BLAIN.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE parish of Stonykirk, more properly Stephenkirk,
composed of the united parishes of Stonykirk, Clashank,
and Tofcarton, in Stranraer presbytery, lies in the county of
Wigton; and is bounded by the bay of Luce on the east, Kirk-
maiden parish on the south, the Irish channel and Portpatrick
parish on the west, and by the parishes of Inch and Glenluce on
the north.  It contains about 17,000 acres; of which, 700, 
lying along the bay of Luce, are of a sandy soil, hardly capa-
ble of improvement.  The foil of the rest of the parish is, in
general, light and dry; and favourable to an early har-
vest.

   Proprietors and Rent.-In the parish there are five heritors;
the two most considerable of whom reside in it.  The valued
rent is L. 4924 Scots; the real rent, services, etc. included,
is estimated at L. 3169: 2: 7 sterling; but a considerable rise
may soon be expected.
