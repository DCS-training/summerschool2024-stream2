ing, notwithstanding what has been said in its behalf, is
still to be considered as only in a state of infancy.  They
have a claim to protection and encouragement from their
landlords in particular, with whom they co-operate in eve-

the gratitude of the community at large, by making corn
and grass grow, where neither grass nor corn ever grew be-

money.  The real rent is not so easily ascertained, as a
good deal of it is paid in victual, etc.  Computing the
victual, however, at about 15 s. the boll, which is nearly
the medium price here for the last 7 years, the whole rent
of the parish amounts to upwards of L. 2000 Sterling.

   The farms in general are small: None of them rent a-
bove 100 Sterling, and the greater part of them are under
L. 50.  Each plough, at an average, turns annually about
