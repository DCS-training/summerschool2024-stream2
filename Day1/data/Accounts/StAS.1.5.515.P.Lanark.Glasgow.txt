extensive accommodations, than the present bridewell can
afford, the Magistrates and Council propose to erect a new
one, more properly calculated for the ends proposed, and
on such a plan, that additions can be made to 1, from time
to time, as the circumstances of the city may require.  The
goods effects of this will, it is hoped, b:  experienced by
the community, and towards the expence of it they have
already received two considerable bequests.
   About the middle of last century, the flesh market was
held on the sides of the Trongate, the most public street of
the city, and the same place served for the shambles.  The
disagreeable objects, presented by so nauseous a practice,
suggested a public market near the spot where the late guard-
house stood.-Still however the flesh market and shambles
were within the same area.-A few years ago a farther
improvement was introduced;  the shambles or slaughter
houses were placed by the side of the river, near the old
bridge, and the market was removed to King-street; from
whence there is an easy communication to the shambles,
and where a very spacious beef market is erected on the
east side of that street, the stalls of which are under roofed
pillars, having in the centre a large paved area open
above.-On the opposite side of the street there are similar
buildings, part of which are used as a mutton market, and
the rest as markets for fish, potatoes, butter and cheese.-
The flesh markets being now found too small for the supply
of the inhabitants, the Magistrates and Council propose to
remove the potatoe, cheese and butter markets to a situa-
tion, behind the weigh-house, where suitable accommoda-
tions are to be made for them, and to appropriate the whole
of the markets in King-street for flesh markets.-There is
also a very commodious market for the disposal of garden
stuffs, the consumption of which is very considerably in-
creased within these few years.
