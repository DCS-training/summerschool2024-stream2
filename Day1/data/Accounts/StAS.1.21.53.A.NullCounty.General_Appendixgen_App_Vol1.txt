     The Statistical Account

No fair trial has yet been made of them.  Ironstone is also
found in the lands of Lamancha.
   There is coal in the lands of Whim, Lamancha, and
Magbiehill.  The only vein wrought is the one nearest the
surface; and no attempts have been made to find any other
lying deeper.
   There is also on these lands plenty of turf and peat.
   The surface-soil of the hills, where the veins of ore are
found, is mostly limestone gravel.  The Countess Dowager of
Dundonald has had the fine wooled Lincolnshire shep pas-
turing on these hills and the low grounds for 20 years by-
past, and she imagines they might suit the Shetland breed.
   There is at Lamancha a chalybeate spring, vulgarly called
the Verture (i.e. the Virtue) Well; seemingly containing a
great quantity of fixed air, which holds the iron in solution.
   The ochre work at Lamancha is now manufacturing paint
for sale; it is to be had either in powder, or mixed with
boiled lintseed oil, in quantities not less than 1/4 cwt.  The
ochre is by different processes calcined, grounds and leviga-
ted by trituration with water.
   The powder thus produced is the paint, known by coun-
try wrights under the name of Spanish brown; it is a remark-
ably subtile impalpable powder, of a deep dark red colour.
What is sold mixed with oil is said to dry very quickly.
   The paint in powder is almost entirely attracted by the
nagnet, which it seems is the test of excellence.
