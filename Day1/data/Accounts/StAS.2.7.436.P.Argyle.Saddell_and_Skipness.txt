                THE REV.  JOHN MACFARLANE, MINISTER.



                    I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
            Name-SADDELL is found in ancient chartularies written in the
          v`rious forms of Saundle, Sandel, and Sandale, wbicb, in the
          Scandinavian language, signifies sandy plain.  Skipness, in the,
          same language, signifies ship-point, and was applied to this locality
          from its having been a central station for the fleets of the Normen
          during their struggles for conquest upon this and the neighbour-
          ing coast.  Saddell, disjoined from the parish of Killean, and Skip-
          ness, from Kilcalmonell, were erected into a. united parish in 1753-
            Boundaries.-The parish is of an oblong irregular form, mea-
          suring as its extreme length 25 miles, and 3 as the average
          breadth.   It is bounded on the cast by the Sound of Kilbrannon,
          which separates it from Arran ; on the west, by the parish of Kil-

          south, by Campbelton.
             Topographical Appearances.-In the general aspect of the pa-
          rish, especially when viewed from a distance, the spectator ob-
          serves nothing remarkable.  Undulating groups of heath-crowned
          elevations mark the rising ground, wbilst the declivities are either
          shaded with patches of straggling coppice wood, or subdued by par-
          tial tillage.  A nearer view, however, erpecially from the south, dis-
          closes a beautiful and imposing landscape, consisting of deep and
          expansive. valleys, decked at their entrance near. the sea with the
          mansions of the land-owners, whose lawns and enclosures are im-
