pence of the tenants and cottagers.  Last year the former
were affected at the rate of 11 s. for every 30 L. of real rent.
This assessment varies according to circumstances.  The ul-
timatum is 12 s. for every ploughgate, or 30 l.  Sterling of
rent, which the commissioners of supply cannot exceed.  The
latter pay from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. 6 d. according to their abili-
ties.  The bye-roads in Arroquhar might be kept in good
repair with the one half of the money levied in it, or per-
haps with less; notwithstanding, the assessment is as high as
it is in these parishes within the district, where the roads are
bad, (the trustees having it in their power, to appropriate the
surplus money to any other part of the district, where they
think it necessary), which is considered as a grievance.

   Posts.-Every night, about 8 o'clock, (Wednesday except-
ed), a post arrives from Inverary, and another, at the same
time, from Dumbarton.  These are succeeded by other two,
who wait their arrival, and set out soon after with the mails.
They meet near the head of Lochlong, where they are all
stationed, (which is half way between the post towns, or 22
miles distant from each), and succeed one another alternate-
ly.  There being no allowance made for horses, they are
obliged to travel on foot, which is a laborious talk in winter.
It very rarely happens, however, that the snow is so deep on
the road as to stop travellers.  In March 1782, the commu-
nication between Dumbarton and Inverary was interrupted
for a few days; but such a fall of snow, so uncommon at
that season, may not happen again in a cntury.

   Language.-Both the Gaelic and English languages are
spoken here.  The former is most prevalent, and is best un-
derstood, particularly by the old people.  The names of
places are Gaelic, and descriptive of their local situation.
