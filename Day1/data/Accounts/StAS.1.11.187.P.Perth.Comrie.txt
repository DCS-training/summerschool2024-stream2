the means of improving a great part of the land, in this and
the neighbouring parish of Monivaird.  The raw lime-stone
is brought in a large boat to the E. end of the loch, and there
fold, burnt or unburnt, as purchasers incline.-The greatest
disadvantage, under which many parts of the parish labour, is
the scarcity and high price of fuel.  White timber, or peeled
oak, once plentiful and cheap, is now scarce and dear.  Peats,
at best a troublesome and expensive, though the most common
fuel, are distant from the village, and most of the farms, 2 or
3 miles.  The nearest good coal lies at the distance of 25
miles from the village.  Were the short road made across the
hills to the southward of Comrie, which is earnestly longed for,
coals will become cheaper and more plentiful.  This road
will lessen the distance very considerably, and, when procured,
will tend much to advance the happiness and prosperity of this
part of the country.

   Antiquities.-In 3 different places in the parishes, there are
to be seen the remains of small Druidical temples*.  The
greatest piece of antiquity here is the Roman camp on the
plain of Dalgincross, in the neighbourhood of Comrie.  On
this plain are still visible very distinct remains of two camps,
with only an inconsiderable distance between them, and joined
by an agger+.

*The stones of one of these near the village were broken to pieces, about 10
years ago, and used in building one of the new houses: And it has been remark-
ed, by some lovers of antiquity, that those who were guilty of this act of sacriliege
never prospered afterwards.
*Mr. GORDON, in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, published in 1726, shewa
this to have been the plain, on which the battle was fought between AGRICOLA
and GALGACUS.  One of the camps is 402 paces long, and 392 broad.  The
other is now considerably diminished by the encroachments of the Ruchil.
