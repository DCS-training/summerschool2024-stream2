and on the south-west, it is bounded by the parish of Ban-
chory Devenick; on the east it presents to the sea a bold face of
rock, from 60 to 80 feet high, covered with grass and various
herbs and flowers: then there is a rising bank, arable from the top
of the rock distance, increasing towarsds the southern extre.
