gaining ground.  There are few instances of longevity.  Some
have attained to 90, but none, (at least for these 30 years,) to
100 years of age.

   Rivers and Mineral Springs.-The Avon, which rises
in the parishes of Avondale and Galston, passes through a
part of this district, and runs into the Clyde, not far from
Hamilton.-Near the village of Stonehouse, it has a fall which
would answer for a cotton mill.-There is a mineral spring
at Kittymuir, which has been found to be of service in
scorbutic disorders.  It would, probably, be more resorted to,

better accommodations near it.

the parish, the property of Mr Lockhart of Castle-hill, which
was afterwards, in a great measure, abandoned.  Of late,
different trials have been made, and it is hoped, it will again be
set a going.  The parish, in the mean time, has not suffered
much, being abundatly supplied with a coal 3, and now
4, different coallicries in the parish  of Dalserf, the nearest,
scarcely a mile, and the farthest, not four from the village.
At present, they cost at the work, 10 1/2 d. per cart, which is
more than double what they were 30 years ago.  A cart is sup-
posed to contain about 30 stone, Trone weight.-The pa-
parish abounds in lime; which has been much used of late, for
the purposes of farming.  It is generally sold in shells, at
L. 2: 10 the kiln, and to the tenants of the proprietors, at
L. 2: 5.  A kiln contains 100 bolls of stacked lime.  In
the river, and on the top of the lime stone, there is plenty
of excellent iron stone; which, in all probability, will be-
come soon an object of importance.-There are also fine quar-
