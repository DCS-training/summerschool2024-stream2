enumeration, to amount to 510 souls.  The heritors are in
number 27.  Earl Mansfield is superior of the greater part
of the parish.  Mr Johnstone of Grange, Mr Brown of West-
wood, Mr Richardson of Piercbyhall, are the principal heri-
tors ordinarily resident in the parish.  The most consider-
able non-residing heritor is Mr Beattle of Crieve.  The in-
ferior inhabitants are chiefly farmers and farm-labourers.
Here are, of artisans, 2 blacksmiths, 1 joiner, 1 shoemaker,
5 weavers, 2 tailors.  The people are in general sober, in-
dustrious and healthy; in longevity, some of them have
lived to the ages of 84, and even of 90 years.

   Husbandry.-The husbandry which occupies the farmers
is partly that of the shepherd-life; in part that of agricul-
ture.  It is the Cheviot breed of sheep which is here culti-
vated:  And of this breed there may be between 3000 and
4000 sheep on the farms in the parish.  The black cattle
are of a race allied to that of Galloway; are reared from
calves not bought in; and may be in number about 4000.
The soil is for the most part gravelly, or of the nature of a
morass.  Oats, bear, and barley, are the grains here culti-
vated.  Lime, and dung, with some little marl, are the or-
dinary articles of manure.  The medium extent of the
farms is from 100 to 200 acres.  The lands are tolerably
inclosed with stone dikes, and here and there with ditches
and hedges.  Lint, or flax, is raised in small quantities.
Green crops, for fallowing and forage, have been tried with
a success which has not failed to recommend the example to
general imitation.  In the harvest of 1795, the minister had,
on a field before his door, one of the finest crops of turnips
that have ever been any where produced.  Potatoes are also
raised in very great abundance.  The horses used for the
draught are commonly, in value, such as would fell in the
market from L. 12 to L. 15 Sterling each.
