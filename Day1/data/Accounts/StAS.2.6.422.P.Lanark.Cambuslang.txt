up the coal, and keeping the pits dry. The coals near Glasgow
are in general much deeper than in the upper or eastern parts of
the county, where they have not been so long wrought. At Cam-
buslang, the pits are about 39 1/2 fathoms deep, at Fullarton 65, at
Westmuir 54, at Faskin 49, at Shettleston 42; whereas about Ha-
milton and Dalserf, they are seldom more than 30 fathoms deep, and
at Cleland sometimes only three or four. In sinking pits in this
neigbbourbood, there is often found a bed of free mud or quicksand
many fathoms dee, which is kept from running away, and filling up
the pits, by vast cylinders of iron, about 8 feet in diameter, attached
together with iron bolts. Each of these cylinders may weigh from two
to three tons, and for every fathom of a pit perforating the quicksand
will cost from L. 35 to L. 40. The place where this is most
troublesome is a broad strip or belt of sand, which runs from Sandy
Hills near Tollcross, towards the green of Glasgow. The pits now
wrought at Wellshot, are evidently of long standing, and are said
to be the oldest in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. There are
upwards of 100 coal pits which have been wrought, and if we allow
three years only to each of these, they must have been begun
upwards of three centuries ago. In 1790 about 62 men, young
and old, were employed in these collieries; at present 100 are
employed. An ordinary collier can easily dig 40 cwt., for which
he then received 2s. 2d. a day, and if he wrought hard 13s. a week.
At present, a collier can make 3s. 6d. or 4s. a day, or at the rate
of from L. 1, to L. 1, 4s. a week. The wages of colliers and other
incidental expenses were then estimated at L. 2000 per annunm;
they may now be estimated at L. 2500.* In 1790, about 600 carts
or 360 tons were put out per week, and 18,000 tons per annum. At
present the output is nearly 550 per week, or 30,000 per annum. In
1750, a cart of coals of nine cwt. cost 9d. on the coal hill; in 1790,
they cost 2s.; and at present 2s. 11d. A cart of coals from Well-
shot, weighing 20 cwt. is now laid down at the village of Kirkhill
for 7s. 4d. The driving is 1s.6d., tolls 3d., and cost at the hill 5s. 7d.
	Ironstone abounds in various places in the parish, but is only
wrought on a small scale. Lime is not found here, but is brought
chiefly from lime-kilns in the parish of Kilbride, where it costs from
12s. to 16s. per chalder. The stratum of marble already noticed,
from 6 to l8 inches thick, is known to extend over a great portion of
the parish, and to run into Rutherglen, in the direction of Stonelaw.

fit on the sales is not included.
