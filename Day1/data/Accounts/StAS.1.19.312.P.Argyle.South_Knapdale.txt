ing depredators.  Their estate was fold by Ronald, the
last of the race, to the tale Sir James Campbell of Achna-
breck, and by him conveyed to Campbell of Shirven, in
the possession of whose family it now is.  The Macneils
and Macmillans, after having established themselves along
the eastern coast of Caolisport, were gradually supplanted
by the Campbells.  The former found means to preserve
the property of two or three farms in that part till towards
the beginning of this century, when they were excambion-
ed, with the then Argyle, for the island of Colussnay.  But
by far the most considerable family in South Knapdale was
the Macalasters of Tarbert.  Cantire was at that time held
by the Macdonalds; and the Macalafters, who are allowed 
to be a tribe of that clan, possessed almost all the lands
around Tarbert, and along the coast of Lochfine and Loch-

restless tribe of the Campbells, inhabiting a part of Glassary,
who effected a settlement, and erected a fort of fort on the 
west side of Lochgilp.

length they were overcome, and almost extirpated in
two bloody conflicts; first with the Macneils, near the
mouth of West Loch-Tarbert, and afterwards with the
Macalasters on the shore of Lochfine.  The sanguinary po-
licy which deprived the Macdonalds of Cantire, gradually
deminished the authority of the Macalasters.  The Mac-
alfers became masters of Dael and Craiglass, now the pro-
perty of Macarthur Stewart of Milton; and a Peter Dow
Campbell, taking the title of Kildusclan, of all their other
lands north of Inverneil.  These lands, after passing through
the hands of the Campbells of Barnicarry and Askemil,
were purchased, about three years ago, by Mr Macneil,
