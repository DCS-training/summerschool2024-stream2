admit, we have this incontestible proof, and which does
much credit both to the landlords and the tenats:-In
all the large farms, taken in the parish, for 20 years
back and more, there are only 2 or 3 instances in which
a change of the tenants (12 in number, when those of
the mills are reckoned), has taken place; and in one
of these instances, there was a surcease of the fami-
ly of the tenant.  With this small exception, the pre-
sent tanants are either those who have succeeded to
former leases of their fathers, or, being in possession of
their own for many years, have renewed them again.
If it be asked.  What are their circumstances?  The an-
swer is, They are not only those of credit and wealth,
but that some of the farmers are in such a degree of
both, as will probably raise the rank of their families.
   Both a mistake is here to be taken notice of, too rea-
dily entertained, either by the invidious or the superfi-
cial speculators, on what has been stated above, of the
quadrupled value of land property; who, nowithstand-
ing what has been proved, that the tenants have profited
highly by this event, rashly conclude, that the proprie-
tors are the only, or greatest gainers in consequence of
it.  So far is this opinion from being just, that it may
be affirmed, on the contrary, that had the landlords, ei-
ther here or in most other parts of the S. of Scotland,
sorborn their exertions, and spared their expenses of
improvement, their rents, in the progressive course of
trade and population in the British dominions, would
have been, by this time, more than doubled to them.
But it is to be presumed, that some of them, when they
reckon the cost of their agricultural improvements,
will, for the sake of the good done to their country.
