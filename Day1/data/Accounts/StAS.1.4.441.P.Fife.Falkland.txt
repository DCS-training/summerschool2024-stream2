and mountains of Scotland.  On the eastern Lomond is
plenty of limestone rock, a few feet below, and in some
places very near the surface, and easily wrought.  There
are also strata of coal of very good quality, but not yet dis-
covered in such quantity as to be thought worth the dig-
ging, especially in a country where there is a abundance of
fine coal, at a reasonable rate, in the neighbouring parishes
of Leslie and Markinch.  On the south side of the same
hill, too, was formerly discovered a lead-mine of very rich
ore but either through unskilfulness, or necessity of circum-
stances, given up.  It is now opened again, and with hope
of success.  There is also in the parish, particularly on the
Lomond hills, plenty of sand, and moorstone of good qua-
lity for building, and easily got at.  Marl and fuller's earth 
have been discovered, but in small quantities.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's reports, the
numbers were 1795.  In the parish at present are 2198 
souls.  Of these 937 are in the town of Falkland, 120 in
Ballinblae, a contiguous village, 193 in Newton, another
village, 476 in Freuchie, another village, and 472 in what
is properly the country part of the parish.
