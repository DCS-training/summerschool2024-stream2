     STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF LENTHRATHEN.

     BY THE REV. ALEX. THOMSON, MINISTER.

   THE late minister, though a man of sense and learning,
yet labouring under the infirmities of old age, when statis-
tical inquiries were set on foot, did not undertake writing
the account of this parish.  An anonymous account, how-
ever, was soon published; but not being so complete as
could be wished; which indeed could not be expected from
a person, who was probably a stranger to the district; it
therefore occurred to the present incumbent, after receiving
Sir John Sinclair's last letter, requesting some additional
information on the same subject, that this might be a proper
opportunity of writing a brief Statistical Account of the
parish, comprehending as much of the information desired
as can be obtained, or as circumstances will admit.
