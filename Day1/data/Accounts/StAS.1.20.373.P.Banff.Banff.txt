the King, as a mark of his royal favour, made him his
Chaplain for Scotland, with a pension of L. 200.
   In April 1661, he accompanied the Earl of Glencairn,
Chancellor, and the Earl of Rothes, President of the Coun-
cil, to London, to lay before the King an account of the
state of affairs in Scotland.
   In a council held at Whitehall soon after, Mr Sharp was
nominated Archbishop of St Andrews.  A resolution ha-
ving been formed to fill up all the other vacant fees, the
choice of proper persons was left to the new Archbishop,
who, (according to his inveterate enemy Bishop Burnet),
acted in this instance with great moderation.  One of his
first official acts, after his preferment to the Archiepiscopal.
See, was, obtaining a proclamation prohibiting the meeting
of clergymen in presbyteries or other church judicatories,
until the Bishops arranged a plan for their procedure.
   This, and some other rigorous measures, raised against
him an host of enemies, several of whom bound themselves
by solemn vow to sacrifice him to the sufferings of their
party.  They at length accomplished their horrid purpose
by assassination, attended with circumstances of savage bar-
barity*.
