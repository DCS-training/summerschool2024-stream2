the session on other persons in distress.  These inrolled
poor are 27 in number.  They have from 2 s. to 4 s. a-
month; or from L. 1, 4 s. to L. 2, 8 s. annually.  The col-
lections at the church-door and other dues, belonging to
the session, amount to about L. 35, and the assessment is
L. 30, forming together the annual sum of L. 65.  Of this,
L. 45 are required for the support of the poor on the roll;
and the remainder is bestowed in occasional charities, and
in defraying the little necessary expences of the church.
   Though these inrolled poor are the most indigent persons
in the place, none of them are in such a state of poverty as

ing to the parish, as it is made known to all who are ad-
mitted upon the poors-roll, that if they happen to beg they
forfeit their pension.

   Rents.-This parish contains more land of a low value
than any other part of the country at an equal distance from

neas the acre; but there are many fields in tillage, towards
the hills, of inferior value.
   The rent of houses for cottagers is usually from 15 s. to
40s. a-year.  The houses which give 40 s. are well built
and slated, but are too high priced for the income of a com-
mon labourer.

   Crops.-The prevailing crops here are, wheat, barley,
oats, beans, pease, potatoes, summer tares, clover, and rye-
grass.  The sowing of bear is entirely given up.  There is
very little flax cultivated, and no rye.  Few turnips are
raised, and seldom any cabbages or coleworts, but in sparing
