The proceedings of the Committee of Parliament, appointed
for the valuation of the teinds of Argyleshire, which sat in Inverary
in 1629 and 1630, once formed a part of the records in posses-
sion of the synod of Argyle, as did also the report of the Commis-
sion for Plantation of Churches appointed by an unprinted Act of
Parliament, * dated January 21, 1649, and which met in Inverary.
Both were removed to the Teind Office, Edinburgh.  It is believed
that the only papers now in the possession of the synod that re-
spect the actings of that commission are nine acts, extracted under
the hand of John Yuill, clerk to the commissioners, dated 17th
October 1750, continuing the summons raised before them for
planting, dividing, and dismembering of the parishes of Kilchrenan,
Clachandysart, and Inishail, Lochgoilhead, Kilmorich, Kilmaglass,
and Kilmore, Kilmichael and Giassarie, Kilchattane and Kilbran-
don, Kilmichall, Inverglussay and Kilmadocharmuk, Kilmaluag,
and Kilcallmikill, and Kilmore, and Kilbryde.
    The lowland congregation of Inverary was formed into a sepa-
rate erection or cure by a decreet of modification and locality, pro-
nounced by the commissioners, dated 26th December 1651.
