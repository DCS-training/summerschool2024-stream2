   This parish is indebted to its late proprietor for another
important improvement.  All along the high ways, he gave
leases and feus of spots of little value, for building.  On
these there are now upwards of 50 handsome cottages erect-
ed, filled with industrious inhabitants, having neat little kit-

   Produce.-The land here produces principally wheat,
beans, pease, oats, butter, cheese, and hay from artificial
grasses.  There is not much barley cultivated here; and,
from the strength on the land, flax and turnips are not raised

inhabitants cultivate potatoes for domestic use.  The average
quantity of wheat sold, may be about 500 bolls a year, each
boll being a little more than 4 Winchester bushels.  Before
this year, there have not been good crops of pease and beans
for several years past; but in tolerable seasons there may be
about 600 bolls sold annually.  There is generally also a con-
siderable quantity of oat meal sold out of the parish, besides
what is consumed at home; so that the produce exceeds the
consumption of the inhabitants.  The hay, butter, and 
cheese is mostly sold to Glasgow, and the quantity of hay is
some years considerable; but it is difficult to form an average
of it.

   It has been already observed, that trees of all kinds suc-
ceed well in this parish.  The Weymouth pine has come to
a great size in sheltered places.  The balsam and berry bear-
ing poplars seem also to thrive greatly.  Thorn hedges, on
the most stiff and sterile parts, grow stunted a little, after a
