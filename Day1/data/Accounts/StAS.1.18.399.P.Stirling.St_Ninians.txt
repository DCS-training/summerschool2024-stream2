of all other monopolies: Fraud, extortion, insolence, and
inferior workmanship.  If these crimes be seldom committed,
the cause must be fought in the miller, not in the nature of
the monopoly.

   Manufacturers and others.-The education and manners of
our manufacturers so nearly resemble the education and man-
ners of our farmers, that a description of the latter in a great
measure supersedes the necessity of describing the former.
Though distinguished by some peculiarities inseparable from
their professions, our manufacturers possess a degree of en-
largement of mind, which reflects considerable honour on
the order.
   This happy effect must chiefly be ascribed to the general
causes which are every where diffusing an ennobling light
through the mass of mankind.  In this place, however, some
other causes contribute a subordinate influence to enlighten
the minds of our people.  The absence of great manufacto-
ries, by obliging the individual to transact business for him-
self, prevents the degradation of mind which invariably follows
a minute subdivision of labour.  Many of our manufacturers,
as well as of our farmers, are admitted to the office of an elder
in the different congregations connected with the parish.
The duties and privileges of the office, tend not only to en-
large the minds of the elders, but enable them also in their
intercourse with others, to extend the sphere of general in-
formation.  Add to this, that the public business, in most of
our congregations, is conducted on a very liberal plan.  The
great body of the congregation is frequently assembled and
consulted, and the habit of thinking acquires additional
strength from the opinions which, on these occasions, are
Openly proposed and discussed.
