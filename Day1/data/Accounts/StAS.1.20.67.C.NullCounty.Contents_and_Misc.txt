form you, that in the third volume of Prynn's Records, there is a large, but
indigested list, of all those in Scotland, who paid homage to Edward I, in
1291, and 1296, forming a kind of Dooms-day Book of the country at that
period.  Four years ago, I, with some labour, reduced the numerous names
and designations into alphabetical order, and the list being now adapted to
general use, and containing the names and designations of the chief Land-
holders, Citizens, and Clergy, at the time, it may be regarded as of no small
importance to our ancient Statistics, topography, and genealogy.  If your
opinion coincides, I shall with pleasure present it to you for the purpose,
and correct the press.

   the 2d of June 1794.

   NOT only the Analyse de l'Etat Statistique d'Ecosse, but also the larger
Work, in English, I have perused with the greatest satisfaction and
delight.
   There are dark oblivious ages in the history of the world, during which
the human mind remained buried in torpid inactivity.  There are other pe-
riods, when the vivid powers of man awaken from their lethargy, and, as if
refreshed, after a long and undisturbed repose, exert themselves with re-
doubled energy.  The times in which we live, belong to the latter descrip-
tion; but that they do so, is owing to the generous and well directed exer-
tions of enlightened and patriotic individuals.

     Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes,
     Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo.

   No XXVII.  Extract of a Letter from J. P. Andrews, Esq; the Au-
   thor of the Continuation of Dr Henry's History, dated 31st Decem-
   ber 1795.

   IF any one can aid my researches, it must be the Author of the Statistical
Account of Scotland, a book which I have perused with equal pleasure
and astonishment, I may almost say, envy, since the southern part of the
island ought to blush, at having never produced a similar work.
