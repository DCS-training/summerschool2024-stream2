and both the red and white herrings of Wick have met with
the highest approbation in the London and other markets.

   The success of the herring fishing has been various, but,
on the whole, increasing in proportion to the number of ad-
venturers, and the skill they acquire*.  In 1790, 32 vessels
on the bounty, measuring 1610 tons, lay at Wick, but were
greatly hampered for want of a good harbour.  In 1791,
the number amounted to 44, crammed close to one another,
in a worse condition than ever.  They were much damaged
by a storm in the height of the fishing season, notwithstand-
ing which, the quantity caught was reckoned not inferior to
that of 1790; and was sufficient to load all the bounty ves-
sels.  Many more might have been caught, had there been a
good harbour for the vessels:  At present boats only can be
made use of; and it is an agreeable sight, in a fine evening,
to see upwards of 200 of them at once under sail, the
crews in high spirits, setting out for the fishing; it would,
however, be still more pleasing to see as many large vessels
busied in the same occupation, which might be the case
were the harbour made more commodious.  Notwithstand-
ing the success of late years, the fisheries of Wick are as yet
in their infancy.  Before they can flourish, so as to become
a national object, different encouragements would be neces-
sary.  A good harbour is much wanted, as nothing of the
kind can be found on all the east coast of Caithness; a cir-
cumstance that has occasioned much damage, as well as loss
