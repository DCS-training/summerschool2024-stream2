     of Mary-kirk.

   In 1771, the land was generally very wet and full of
weeds, and there were few attempts made to destroy them.
Since that time, every field has been not a little drained and
cross-ploughed; but all care has been taken to destroy the
weeds; and afterwards by lime and dung to procure a good
crop.
   In 1771, the farmers generally, ploughed with oxen; having
4, 6, or 8 in a plough.  But in 1795, it is presumed, they
have too much laid them aside, and betaken themselves to
horse-ploughs; and apply 4 or 2 in a plough, as they think
sufficient for the nature of the soil, the time, progress, and
mode of dressing it.
   In 1771, beef sold at 2 s 6 d, and 3 s per stone; mutton at
2 s 6 d, and 2 s 8 d per do; butter 6 d per lib.; cheese 3 s, or
3 s 9 d per stone; chickens 1 d 1/2 each; hens from 5 d to 8 d
each; eggs 1 d 1/2, or 2 d per doz.; salmon 1 d per lib.; and in
former times, each of these articles proportionally lower.  In
1795, beef sells at 5 s 4 d, or 6 s per stone; mutton at 5 s 4 d
per do.; butter from 10 d, to 13 d per lib.; cheese from 5 s to
6 s per stone; chickens from 4 d, to 7 d each; hens from 1 s,
to 1 s 4 d each; eggs from 4 d, to 8 d per doz.; salmon is sel-
dom used but at the tables of the rich, and is 6 d per lib.  In
the month of August, young salmon begin to be sold at 2 d 1/2
per do.
   In 1771, oat-meal sold at 10 s, or 10 s 6 d per boll; bear
seldom exceeded the price of meal; but since 1780, oat-meal
has been generally increasing in its price, and bear and barley
have sold for more.  Barley generally exceeds Chester bear,
1 s 6 d, or 2 s per boll.  In 1795, oat-meal has got up from
16 s, to L. 1 ster. per boll; and bear and barley it is supposed,
will bring more money.  There is not much flour bread used
here; what is needed is bought from the baker in loaves and
biscuit.  Turnips are more generally used for milk-cows and
