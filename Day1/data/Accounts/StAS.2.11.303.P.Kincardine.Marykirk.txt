the census of 1841, it amounted to 2389. The increase of inha-
bitants is to be attributed to the progress of manufactures, it be-
ing principally observable in the village of Luthermuir, where
many weaving shops have been established.
	The parish contains two villages, Larykirk, in which the church
stands, and Luthermuir, nearly four miles distant from it. The
former contains nearly 300 inhabitants, the latter about 1090, con-
sequently about 1000 reside in the country part of the parish.
  	The average number of births may be about 50, and of marriages
22, for the last seven years. The number of deaths cannot be
given, there having been no record kept of such.
	Of nobility, there are none residing in the parish. Two fami-
lies of independent fortune, Robert Taylor, Esq. of Kirktonhill,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser of Balmakewan, reside constantly
in the parish. Each proprietor derives an income from land above
L.50.
 	The number of inhabited houses in the parish is 554; of un-
inhabited houses, 2O.
  	There is only one insane person belonging to the parish; fatu-
ous, 8: blind, 3; deaf and dumb, 2.
  	The general character of the people is moral and religious;
they are decidedly intelligent. Poaching for game and also for
salmon in the North Esk, has prevailed to a considerable extent
in this parish hitherto, but it is hoped that the Kincardineshire
Society for the Protection of Game will speedily put a stop to this
demoralising practice.

    Agriculture.-"Marykirk is essentially an agricultural parish-
the manufactures carried on being limited to a flax spinning-mill
at Caldham, and the hand-loom weaving of linen in Luthermuir.
To which may be added three or four saw-mills, chiefly employed
in cutting up home-grown fir timber, for agricultural purposes.
  	The parish contains 9320 imperial acres which may be thus
classified:
