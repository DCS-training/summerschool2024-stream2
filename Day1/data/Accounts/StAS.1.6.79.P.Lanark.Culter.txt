     of Culter.

a small circular artificial mound of earth, on the banks of the
Clyde, within view of two others at a considerable distance.
-The principal disadvantage are the distance from coal,
which is brought 11 miles from Douglas, and the want of 2
bridge over the Clyde, which is often impassable.  There are
few peat-mosses here, and not many people who dig more fuel
than is necessary for drying their grain for the mill.-There are
some mineral springs, impregnated with iron; and iron-stone,
said to be an excellent quality, is found in great plenty, in
different parts of the parish.
