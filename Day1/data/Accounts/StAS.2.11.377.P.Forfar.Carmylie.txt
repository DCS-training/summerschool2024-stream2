ries were then worked chiefly for slates; they are now work chiefly
for pavement, and to a much greater extent,--the annual amount
of sales from them exceeding the yearly rental of the land. Many
enclosures have been made, more substantial than the fences at
that time,--great improvements have been made in all the imple-
nents of husbandry,--and in the management of land, an extend-
ed and much imprnved cultivation of the soil has taken place,--
not only supplying food in greater quantity, but of a more whole-
some and nourishing quality than had been enjoyed in former
times; and I am inclined to think, that, owing to this and to the great
extent to which draining has been carried in the parish, a great im-
provement has taken place in the salubrity of its climate, and in
the health of its inhabitants. Great improvements also in point
of comfort, accommodation, and cleanliness, have taken place in
the houses of all classes, and there can be no doubt that, general-
ly speaking, they are far better-fed, clothed, and lodged than
their forefathers. Farm-steadings also are much better construct-
ed, and more substantially built. In some instances, cultivation
has been extended too far in reclaiming soils of very inferior qua-
lity, which, though they gave a tolerable return when the price of
grain were high, and upon the first application of lime or marl,
now show a strong tendency to revert to their original state of
whins or broom,--which would be far more agreeable to the eye
than the bleak appearance which they now exhibit, and might be
more profitable than the miserable crops or scanty herbage which
they now produce.
	Considering the high and exposed situation of the parish, plan-
tations of wood are much wanted, both fnr ornament and shelter--
and though there is much done in both these respects on the
estate of Guynd, and a good deal also upon the Conansythe estate,
yet the greater part of the parish has no protection from the north
or east winds, and, though containing but a small proportion of un-
cultivated land, has rather a bleak appearance from the want of
woods and of hedge-rows. Besides the wastes alluded to, a pro-
portion of the land in cultivation on almost every farm might be
more profitably occupied with plantations of wood,--which, if ju-
diciously laid out, would at greatly improve the climate of the parish,
and the productiveness of the soil, and, if properly attended to,
would, besides gradually meliorating the soil, give a far greater re-
turn than can possibly arise from it in any other way.
	Some years ago a new line of road was projected from the pa-
