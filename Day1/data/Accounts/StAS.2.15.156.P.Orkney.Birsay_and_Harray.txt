	  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons who
        receive aid from the parochial funds is 12, and the average allow-
        ance to each is 2s. 6d. per quarter.  In some cases, however, more
        or less is given, as the kirk-session may think fit. The fund is
        made up of collections at the church door, mort-cloth dues, and
        marriage dues,-amounting in all to about L. 5 yearly.
          Fairs.-There are three fairs held annually in this parish, at
        which only cattle and horses are sold.
