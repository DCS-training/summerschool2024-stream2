small islands of Damsay, and the Holm of Grimbister in
the bay of Firth, is about 10 miles.  The shores are low
and flat, which facilitates the labour, and lessens the ex-
pense of making kelp.  The tangle, or sea-weed, is cut in
some places every other year, but more generally every
third year, for that purpose:  there being no tide-way
about these shores, the sea-weed grows more slowly than
in many others places.  The quantity of kelp made an-
nually, is, at an average, about 80 tons; the expense of
making it, about 1 l. 6 s. the ton, (reckoning 24 cwt.  to
the ton).  Where the shores are deeper, and the labour
greater, the expense is proportionably so.

   Soil, Mode of Husbandry, Size of Farms, &c.-The
soil is various, in moss places shallow, upon a tilly bot-
tom, or on rotten rock.  In the inland part of those pa-
rishes, the soil is pretty deep, and rather of a mossy na-
ture.  The best land is near the sea on flat points, where
the soil is loamy.  Oats and bear, both of a poor quali-
ty, are the only species of grain raised.  The arable land
is always in tillage; under the alternate crops of these
or where manure can be got in greater quantity, the ro-
tation is two crops of bear and one of oats.  With 2 
or 3 exceptions, the side plough only, with one slit, is
used.  In a rich tender soil, it answers extremely well
for giving the last ploughing for the bear crop; but
where the ground is strong or stony, it seems very im-
proper, especially in oatland.  The returns, in middling
soil, and ordinary seasons, are supposed to be 3 of oats,
and between 4 and 5 of bear.  In general, the oat crop
turns to poor account.  In a favourable season, the bear
crop is better than might be expected, from the state of
husbandry above described.  Potatoes are raised by each
