dom; and that he was as much formed for wielding the
sword, as for wearing the surplice, appears from the follow-
part of his history: "When he resided at his palace of
Aughtertool in Fife, the sheriff of that county went with a
body of 500 men, to make head against the English, who
had landed in that neighbourhood; but observing that the
country was laid waste, and that the enemy kept a good
countenance, the sheriff fell back as fast as he could.  On
hearing this, the bishop armed himself, took horse with a-
bout 60 of his people, who were well disciplined, soon
meets the sheriff, cries aloud, "What madness is it in you
to run away at this rate?" The sheriff replied, "Because
the English are more numerous and better soldiers than
we are."  "If you got your due, says the bishop, the king
would cause chop off your golden spurs; but follow me,
and with the assistance of St Columbus, whose lands they
lay waste, we shall have our revenge."  With these words
he throws away his bishop's staff, grasps his sword, turns
himself to the sheriff, with this expression, "Do follow
me."  They did follow him, came up with the enemy,
and happily obtained a complete victory.  There fell that
day more than 500 English, besides a number, who, by
crowding into their boat, overset it and were all drown-
ed."  Sinclair was a great favourite of the king, (Da-
vid II.), who always in conversation called him "My own
bishop;" and the letters he wrote to him were addressed,
"To our bishop."  Sinclair died 27th June 1337, having
filled the see of Dunkeld 25 years.  He was buried in the
quire of Dunkeld, which he built from the foundation;
and in memorial of this work, he caused to be erected on
the top of the east gable of the quire, (the present church
of Dunkeld), a fluted cross, (part of the armorial bearings
of his family), which is still standing there.-Bishop George
Brown, of whom we made mention on a former occasion,
