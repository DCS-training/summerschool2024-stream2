   Employments.-Of these families 28 are tenantry; the rest
consist of shepherds, hinds, day labourers, and some trades-
men.  The number of the latter, owing to the neighbourhood
of Hawick, is small.  There is not a shoemaker in the pa-
rish.  The nature of the soil and climate has suggested to
herds and labourers the use of a kind of a strong leather
shoe, with a wooden sole, shod with iron.  This is purchased
in the market town, mended at home, and known by the
name of clogs.

   Condition and Character.-The inhabitants, in their several
stations, are comfortable and independent; nor are there
wanting instances of considerable wealth.  They are equally
industrious and frugal.  There are a good many separatists
from the Established Church; Burghers, Antiburghers, and
Cameronians; but no Episcopalians or Roman Catholics.  The
character of separatists and adherents scarce admits of any
shade of distinction, unless it be, that the former have the ap-
pearance of greater zeal in religious matters than the latter.
In other respects, they are much alike.  If the Seceders
think themselves more religious, those belonging to the
Establishment fancy themselves better moral men, and more
heartily attached to Government.  Happily no party rancour
is known, and no religious or political controversies interrupt
the exercise of that sympathy to one another in distress, and
of that neighbourly and obliging disposition, which are the
more striking and distinguishing features of the Christian
character.
