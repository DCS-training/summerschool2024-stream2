higher price than the barley per bushel. The weight of the lat-
ter used to run from 49 lbs. to 53 lbs. per bushel; but of late it,
has sunk so low as 42 lbs. A regular rotation system of husbandry
is now introduced. Some farmers, I believe, still crop too severely,
but, as old leases drop, that abuse is guarded against by the land-
lords in granting new ones. The rotation extends to four, or in
very good soils to five years, but never goes beyond that. For-
merly a rotation of seven, and even eight years was not uncom-
mon. Turnips are every where cultivated, and in general to great
advantage. The kinds commonly raised are the Swedish, the globe,
the purple top, and the yellow bullock.
