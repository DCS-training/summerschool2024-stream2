the misfortune is, that having earned a little money, (for,
after a five years residence, their wages are augmented),
they are enabled to overbid the honest industrious farmer,
who is incumbered with a number of small children, and
who perhaps may have fallen into a temporary arrear,
upon whom the unfeeling landlord has no compassion.  But,
behold the consequence!  in a few years, from ignorance
and want of industry, the emigrant, in his turn, is also re-
duced to poverty, and must give way to another of his own
tribe.  By these means, most of the farms are over-rented;
and this fluctuating state of things puts an effectual bar to all
improvement, and surely calls aloud for reformation from
every virtuous landholder.  There are at present, from this
parish alone, in this infernal settlement, 43 of our prime
young men; and 12 more are just upon the eve of embark-
ing:  This, added to the number of seamen abroad, scarce
leaves hands to cultivate the ground, and must sooner or
later depopulate the country.  By those means there are
later depopulate the country.  By those means there are
no spare hands for manufactures; and the fishery, which,
next to the kelp, ought to be the great staple of Orkney
commerce, is entirely abandoned; and besides, the King's
service is deprived of many hardy seamen; for the moment
war is proclaimed, for fear of being pressed, they skulk
away to this distant settlement.  At the same time it must
be acknowledged, for the honour of the Hudson's Bay Com-
pany, that no men ever acted with more integrity, or ful-
filled their agreements more honestly, than those gentle-
men have uniformly done; and further, upon a representa-
tion from the present incumbent of this parish, they have
been pleased to augment the wages to L. 10; by which
means above L. 1000 Sterling per annum is added to the in-
come of Orkney.
