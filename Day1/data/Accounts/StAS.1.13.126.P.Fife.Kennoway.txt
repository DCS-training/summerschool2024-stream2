besides two or three in its near neighbourhood, became
useless, and soon fell into ruin:  the whole, however, have
been repaired or rebuilt of late, and are now inhabited by
weavers and oher trades people.  There are at present, but
two brewers in the parish, keeping ale-houses, none of which
can well be termed an inn.  A turnpike-road is making in
the old line through the village.

   Agriculture, etc.-After what was said of the nature of
the soil, little need be said of the crops it produces.  The 
greatest part is enclosed or enclosing, and every farm bears
wheat, barley, oats, pease, beans, potato, and turnip.
The soil of the greatest part is particularly adapted to po-
toto.  That root is therefore generally and carefully cul-
tivated.  Nearly the whole grass is sown.  The valued rent
is L. 4442: 13: 2 Scots.  The real rent of land, about
L. 2400 Sterling.  The rent of land rose to a great height
here several years ago:  about 125 acres, that lie conti-
guous to the village, and had for ages been let to the inha-
bitants, at from 14 s. to L. 1, 8 s. the acre, were let 8 years
ago at L. 2 and L. 3, and the greatest part at upwards of
L. 4 the acre.  For some years past, the form and fashion
of the plough has been perpetually changing.  The wright
and smith seem now to understand their interest just as well
as the button and buckle maker.  The principles of this
useful instrument seem to be but imperfectly understood as
yet; and till they be understood, the operation of taste and
fashion, and art cannot be excluded.  The plough in use at
present is said to be Small's somewhat improved, i. e. al-
tered.  It was lately introduced from the coast of Angus,
into the north side of Fife, and has become pretty general
over the county.  It is drawn by two horses, and held and
managed by one man; the beam and handles are short,
