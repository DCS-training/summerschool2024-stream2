sie; on the south, by the parishes of Baldernock and New-
kirkpatrick; and on the west and north, by the parish of Kil-
learn.  It lies 10 miles north from Glasgow, 14 east by south
from Dunbarton, and 20 southwest from Stirling.  Its form
is an oblong square, 5 miles long, and 4 miles broad.

   Soil, and face of the Country.-This parish may properly be
distinguished into valley and moor grounds.  The valley is
bounded by high hills on the north, and by a rising ground on
the south side of the river, which ascends about one third of
the height of the opposite hills.  This hanging ground on each
side of the river, consists of a light quick soil, is well culti-
vated, and produces excellent crops.  Toward the western
extremity, the valley widens considerably; and the soil there,
on the level grounds, is clay mixed with a rich earth, depo-
sited from time to time, by the overflowing of the river.
This soil is fit to carry heavy crops of any kind of grain.
   The moor runs parallel to the valley, commencing at the
brink of the rising ground on the south side of the river, and
extending in an uneven surface, about a mile and a half in
breadth.  Here the ground descends into the parish of New-
kirkpatrick, with a declivity similar to that with which it as-
cends from the Blane.  A great proportion of this consists of
heath; but in many places, particularly on the south border,
and in the western extremity, it is now cultivated, and pro-
duces crops nearly as rich as those in the Strath.  The soil
here, in the parts susceptible of cultivation, is dry, light,
and rocky; and from the return which it makes, when pro-
perly laboured and manured, gives great encouragement to
the improver.  Besides these moor and valley grounds, the
halls on the north side of the parish afford most excellent pas-
ture for black cattle and sheep.
