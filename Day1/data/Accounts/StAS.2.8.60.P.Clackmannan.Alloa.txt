   Divine service is well attended both in the Established churches,

There is also a Religious Tract Society, supported by all persua-
sions, the average annual contributions to which may amount to

with the Establishment collected last year for religious and cha-
ritable purposes, the sum of L. 220 ; the first congregation in

   The following is a list of the clergymen of the parish of Alloa
from the commencement of the present existing records:-Epis-
copalian, Air James Duncanson from 1609 to 1620; Mr John
Craigingelt, 1621 to 166-; Mr James Wright, admitted on 23d
November 1664.-Presbyterian, Mr George Turnbull admitted

1704.
   Mr Logan was translated from Kilmadock. Prior to Mr Lo-

Broad Street, or John Street, now stands, having been then feued
by John Earl of Mar. Mr John Taylor was translated from Til-
licoultry, and was admitted on 7th December 1725 ; and in March
1735, be was translated to the Tolbooth Church, Edinburgh. Mr
James Gordon was translated from the parish of Alford, in Aber-
deensbire, in 1736.
   Mr James Syme was inducted in or about 1750, and was set-
tled by military force, in consequence of the opposition of the pa,-
rishioners, although afterwards they became much attached to
him. Mr Syme was succeeded by Dr James Fordyce, who was
translated from Brechin in October 1753, and went to London in
1760, when he was succeeded by Mr James. Frame on the 25th
