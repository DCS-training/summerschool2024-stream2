the first case, it receives no check from any public association,
and next to none from any individual whatsoever. In the last case,
it is not unfrequent, at certain seasons, even on Sabbath, nay, par-
ticularly on that day, especially among the young. It is gratify-
ing to think that smuggling has almost disappeared.

   Agriculture.-In consequence of a very large proportion of the
lands of this parish being in the occupation of proprietors, it is not
easy to arrive at a correct state of the number and value of its acres.
But, from repeated surveys and examinations of the parish minis-
ter, followed up by those of five of his parishioners peculiarly
well qualified to obtain and to communicate the wished-for infor-
mation, the following results, although not mathematically exact,
may be considered as no distant approximation to the truth :-
     The whole of the arable acres may be	                           5240
     Those still in their natural state, but susceptible of improvement,    121
     Those under Wanting,                                             	    215
     Those under buildings, fences, &c.				             24
                                                                           ______
                                                                            5600
	The kinds of trees generally planted are, larch, Scotch fir, and
spruce. Those of the oldest standing are round the mansion-house,
while those recently planted on the trust-estate of Kinross, and on
the lands of Lethangiie, Lathro, Easter Balado, &c. are both hard
wood and fir. The whole seem well attended to and thriving.
