tion of the Sleat teinds.  The minister, weather permitting,
officiates in Rum once a month; in Isle Muck, once a
month; in Canna, once a quarter; and the rest of the time
in Eigg.  He must attend the meetings of presbytery at Sky,
and of synod at Glenelg or Sky, and consequently cannot be
above a third of his time at home.  He must, at his own
expence, keep a boat of a consideruble size, and well rigged,
always in readiness to transport him to these several islands,
which must be a considerable diminution of his income.  Do-
nald M'Lean is now minister of this parish, who was admit-
ted and fettled in October 1787.  His predecessors in office
were Malcolm M'Askill, who died April 1787, and was ad-
mitted in 1757; and Donald M'Queen, the first minister of
the parish as a separate charge, who was admitted in 1726,
and translated to Uist in 1756.  The present minister is
married, has 3 sons and 2 daughters.  A manse, for the first
time, was built in Eigg in 1790, and a preaching house in
Eigg, for the first time also, in 1793.

   State of the Poor.-The number of poor, on the kirk ses-
sion roll, of the reformed religion, is 19, and those of the
Roman Catholic, 20.  They indiscriminately travel, and re-
ceive alms through the parish.  There is no fixed fund, ex-
cept about 30 s. a year given by Mr M'Lean of Coll, for the
poor in Rum.  The session fund consists only of a little mo-
ney collected on Sabbaths, and of fines paid by delinquents.
This money is, once a year, distributed among the poor of
the reformed.  The priest is left at liberty to uplift fines
from delinquents of his own persuasion, and to apply them in
a similar manner.
