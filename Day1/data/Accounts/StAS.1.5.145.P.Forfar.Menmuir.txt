     NUMBER VIII.

     PARISH OF MENMUIR.

     (COUNTY OF FORFAR.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN WAUGH.

     Origin of the Name.

   IF Men or Mun in the Celtic, as has been said, means a
moss or bog, then Menmore will signify the great moss,
which etymology receives considerable credit from the face
of the parish to the south, and the remains of marshy grounds
in that quarter.
   The name was anciently Menmure and Menmore, the
last syllable of which is well known to be a common
termination to names of places in this kingdom, such as
Strathmore, the great valley, Knemmore, the great head, and
Benmore, the great hill.  It should seem, not only from le-
gendary report, but from a fine spring which still goes by
his name, that in the times of Popery, the church there had
been dedicated to St Aidan, which appellation was also
given sometimes to the parish itself.  This holy man was
British; his name appears in some of our calendars; he flou-
rished in the 7th century, and is said to have been Bishop
of Lindistarne before that fee was transferred to Durham.
Under the auspices of Oswald, king of Northumberland, he
converted his subjects to the Christian faith.  That he was
in deserved esteem in that country, along with Bede and St
Cuthbert, there is no doubt.
