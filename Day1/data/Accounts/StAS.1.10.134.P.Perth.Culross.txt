<FOOTNOTE>

*Besides these, a well accomplished female (Miss Farquhar-
son) teaches, with success, English, French, writing, (an un-
commonly fine hand), arithmetic, geography, and needle-work.
She has 7 boarders, at 20 L. each per annum; and 5 day-scho-
lars, at 10 s. 6 d. per quarter.
+The diminution of births in 1789 is to be attributed to a
number of colliers having left the place, by a stop being put to
the coalworks; and the increase of deaths in 1790, to the ra-
vages of the small-pox.  The practice of inoculation now be-
gins to take place among all ranks in this parish and neighbour-
hood.
