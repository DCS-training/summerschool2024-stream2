nearer of which is four miles,--would, in any case, have rendered
any thing like a regular attendance upon ordinances altogether
impracticable. This defect was remedied in the case of Troon in
1887, and in that of Fullarton in 1838, by the erection of two
handsome places of worship on the Church Extension principle,
each containing 900 sittings. Both of these churches have or-
dained clergymen, with quoad spiritualia districts assigned.
	The stipend of Troon at present is L. 150, and that of the
other, guaranteed by bond, is L.88, 6s. 8d., which, in both cases,
is raised from the seat-rents and collections, except L.20 of the
former, which is paid by the Duke of Portland. The parish of
Dundonald ecclesiastically contains now a population of only
1307, with 500 communicants; Troon contains 2186, with 500
communicants; and Fullarton 3071, of whom 400 are communi-
cants. The seats in the parish church are all rent-free, being mostly
allocated to the tenantry. In Troon, 120 are free, and the rest are
rented from 3s. to 7s. each. In Fullarton, 100 are free, and the
average rate of those rented is 2s. 6d. Neither of the clergymen
of the new parishes has either manse or glebe. The manse of
Dundonald, which was built in 1784, is, considering the wear of
time, in tolerably good repair. The offices have lately been en-
larged and improved, and are, consequently, in better order.
The glebe is only four and a-half acres, including the site of build-
ings and garden; but the land is good, and very productive.
Previous to 1792, the stipend was 100 bolls 14 pecks of meal,
32 boll 11 pecks of bear, Ayrshire measure, and 20 merks Scots.
That year, an augmentation of L.25, 3s. 2 1/3d. was granted by the
Court, with L.5 additional for communion elements. In 1824,
it was augmented to the present amount, consisting of 17 chalders,
half meal, half barley, and L. 10 for communion elements. The
free teind still amounts to fully L. 600.
	Besides this provision for clerical instruction, the parish has had
the benefit of a resident missionary, connected with the establish-
ment, for the last ten years. He resides in the village of Dun-
donald, and labours among the families at the three coal-works of
Shewalton, Old-Rome, and Gatehead, in the parish of Kilmauns.
The funds for his support are raised by local subscription; but
the burden falls chiefly on the Misses Muir, formerly of Shewal-
ton, to whose Christian beneficence the parish has long been un-
der the greatest obligations.
