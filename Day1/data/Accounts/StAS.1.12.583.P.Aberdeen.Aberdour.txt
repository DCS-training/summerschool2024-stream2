partly the product of limestone brought by sea from the
quarries in the Boyn, and partly from limestone dug up
within the flood-mark of the sea, in the bay of Aberdour,
at low-water; but this last begins to be scarce and hard to be
got at.  There are, besides, two other quarries of a kind of

their farms; nor do they want the means and materials ne-
cessary for that effect; but to various other causes, which
