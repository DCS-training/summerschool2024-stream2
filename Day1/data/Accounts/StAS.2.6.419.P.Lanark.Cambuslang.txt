The thermometer is always highest between 2 and 3 o'clock in
the afternoon, and lowest at 5 o'clock in the morning. During
the great annular solar eclipse, May 15th 1836, the thermometer
exhibited the following phenomena:

	Hydrography.--The Clyde runs about three and a-half miles
on the north of the parish. Its general course through the middle
ward is from south-east to north-west; but here, if we take it from
the point where it enters the parish at the mouth of the Calder to
the point where it leaves it, its course is due east and west. It is
from 200 to 250 feet broad, and, when it fills its channel, sweeps
along with great majesty. The tide generally flows to within a mile
of this parish, and some great spring-tides have been observed to
come up to the confines of it; but this is a rare circumstance. The
greatest floods seldom rise higher than 17 feet above the bed of the
river. On 24th September 1712, the Clyde rose l8 feet 6 inches;
and on 12th March 1782, it attained the enormous height of 20 feet.
There is only one haugh, consisting of 18 acres of very rich land,
liable to be overflowed. The Calder forms the boundary between
Blantyre and Cambuslang for three and a-half miles. It runs due
north, and after passing, a variety of handsome seats in Kilbride,
Blantyre, &c., such as Torrance, Calderwood, Crossbasket, and
Calderbank, falls into the Clyde at a place called Turnwheel, near
Redlies. The banks are in general steep and richly wooded. The
channel is gravel or freestone rock, and is from 30 to 40 feet broad,
but is seldom wholly covered by the stream, which is rapid and
shallow. The Kirk-burn rises near Easter Hill, on the borders of
Carmunnock, and, after a course of about two and a-half miles due
north, joins the Clyde near Moriston. For about a mile and a-
half before its embouchure, it makes several turnings, and is con-
fined by bold and perpendicular rocks of freestone from 50 to 100
feet high. The bold sweep which its banks make near the church
is probably the cam from which the parish derives its name. New-
ton burn rises near Turnlaw, and, after pursuing a northerly course
