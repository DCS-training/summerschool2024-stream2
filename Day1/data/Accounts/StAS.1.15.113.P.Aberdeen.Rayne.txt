a great age.  Rayne lies in an open country, having one ridge
of hills to the S. W. and another to the N. E.  The dry-
ness of the air is owing to this local situation of the parish.
The clouds are attracted by these ridges of hills on each
side, and fogs often rest upon the tops of them, while the in-
habitants enjoy a clear and dry air in the open country.
Sometimes again, when the clouds break into rain on the
hills, or on the sides of the hills, the skirts only of the show-

   Diseases.-We have no epidemical diseases.-In spring and
autumn some fevers appear among the poor people, who live

turnips and milk.  They use little ale, and that not of a good
quality.  But the most fatal disease is pneumonia, or consump-
tion, which cuts off 7 or 8 young people every year.  And
what is very melancholy, there are at present more than 20
persons afflicted with real scrophula, and the number of
such has increased of late; while the parishioners intermar-
ry with one another, they never pay attention to this matter.
Religious prejudices against inoculation for the small-pox
are wearing away, and the practice of inoculating children
is getting in.  But till it universally prevail in a country like
this, it will not be a real blessing.  The infection is com-
municated from the inoculated to the children of those who
