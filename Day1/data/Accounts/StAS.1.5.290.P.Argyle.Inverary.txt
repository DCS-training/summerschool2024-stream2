     Statistical Account

ing seasons, the lower fort of people have been liable to
epidemical fevers and fluxes, probably in consequence of
their excess in eating too much, of a rich and nourishing
food, so different from the spare diet they are accustomed
to, during the greatest part of the year.

   Rivers and Prospects.-The run of the water of Ao-
reidh before it loses itself in Lochsyne, is about 8 English
miles.  It takes its course partly through rugged and un-
even ground, covered with wood, and forms several natu-
ral cascades, that, in wet weather particularly, cannot fail
to strike the ear as well as the eye of the traveller.  At
some distance from the cattle, the valley opens to a consi-
derable extent, and the traveller is presented with rich
meadows, interspersed with stately trees of various kinds.
Here the river as well as the grounds assume a new and
pleasing appearance, formed both by the hand of art and
of taste.  In this part of the river, there are many beautiful
artificial cascades, which, together with Lochsyne, Duni-
coich, (which covered with wood to the height of 700
feet perpendicular), the banks towards Essachosan and the
distant hills and mountains, form together such an assem-
blage of grand and beautiful objects as are rarely to be
seen.  Indeed, in regard to extent of pleasure ground, and
of fine plantations, hardly any place can vie with Invera-
ray.  At two seasons in the year in particular, the prospect
is highly variegated, and truly delightful; and such is the
resort of travellers to it, that in 1790, a hundred have
viewed it in the space of one week, and in 1792 that num-
ber has been doubled in the same space of time.-This
perhaps, may not be considered as strictly speaking analo-
gous to the statistical account of the parish; at the same
time, it would have been unpardonable, to have passed over
