The second, the nature of the soil, number of inhabitants, etc: The third,
the state of the roads, etc.: The fourth, an account of its mines, minerals, and
fossils: The fifth, its police, trade and manufactures: The sixth, its antiqui-
ties: And the last section, miscellaneous observations.  In consequence of
the circulation of this paper, the accounts of five parishes were obtained,
which are printed in the 1st volume of the Transactions of the Society; and
are certainly amongst the most valuable papers of the fort any where to
be met with.
   It was after so many attempts had been made, either fruitlessly, or on a
narrow scale, that the Author of the Statistical Account of Scotland, be-
gan his extensive, laborious, and what was almost universally deemed, his
impracticable undertaking.  Perhaps an ambition to accomplish what others
had failed to execute, might contribute to those exertions, which could
alone carry through so great a Work.  And if its publication should ever
materially promote the improvement of this country, and ameliroate the
situation of mankind in general, (which can hardly fail to be the case), it
must in a great measure be attributed, to those who entered early with zeal
into the cause, and encouraged the Author to persevere, by their approba-
tion, and assistance.
