came necessary to strain the last nerve, which many of them
did, by raising the enormous contribution of 15 L. for every
man who was demanded, in order to procure protections for
the rest.  But now, by an unwarrantable breach of good
faith, protections served only as a passport to the Navy.  One
of the boat-masters was impressed with his protection in his
pocket, and died on board the Salisbury ship of war going
out to the West Indies.  The exactions made on the fishers,
during last war, gave a decisive blow to the fishery at Johns-
haven; and deprived the nation of a valuable nursery
for hardy seamen.  It is now reduced to one large boat in
summer, and 4 or 5 yawls in winter, whose crews consist of
old men and boys, scarce fit to manage an oar.  Thus do the
unjustifiable means, which are had recourse to for the tem-
porary support of any state, frequently tend to its final de-
struction.  Had greater moderation been used in demanding
levies from Johnshaven, during former wars, it might still
have retained its rank among fishing towns, and been able,
on the present emergency, to contribute to the general sup-
port of the nation.
   Another cause concurred in depopulating the sea-faring
part of the town, though the ruin of the fishery can only be
ascribed to the hardships imposed on the fishers by levying
and impressing them.  Many no doubt returned from the
wars richer than when they went away; but, after being
accustomed to a navy life, they returned with ideas above
fishing, as may be supposed, when the case of handing a sail
is compared with the labour of tugging at the oar.  The
prize money and wages many of them had gained, served to
purchase small vessels, which they employed in the coasting
trade; and their habits of industry, acquired in early life, by
degrees raised them to larger.  But the harbour of Johns-
haven being unsafe for vessels of any considerable burthen in
