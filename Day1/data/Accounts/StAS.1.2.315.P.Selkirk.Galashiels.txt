annually, is about L. 30, but it is gradually increasing.  As
most of them can work, their allowance is but small, in
general, not above 9 d. per week, except in times of scar-
city.

   Disadvantages.-The greatest disadvantage, which the pa-
rish and suburbs labour under, is no doubt their distance from
lime and coals; both of which they bring from Middleton, 21
miles from Galashiels, and upwards of 24 miles from several
places in the parish.  Notwithstanding this great distance,
lime is found to be cheaper manure, and coals cheaper fuel,
than the marle and peats in the southern district, though both
are excellent of their kinds.-Want of a post, is another
material disadvantage, to which the village is subjected.  Offices
are established at Stagehall, Selkirk, and Melrose.  The first,
a single house, though farthest distant, is most convenient, be-
ing on the road to lime and coals; but, notwithstanding the
obliging care of the postmaster there, the arrival of letters, 7
miles from a post-office, must always be tedious and uncer-
tain.  There is a certainty that the revenue, which is drawn
there would be at left trebled, were the office removed to Gala-
shiels.-  A third great inconvenience, which the manufacturers
suffer, is want of a stock to carry on their work to a sufficient
extent; of consequence, they are obliged to purchase on credit,
and at a high rate, every necessary article of manufacture, and
to sell the produce instantly, at whatever ready money it will
fetch.  Whereas, were they able to pay at once for all they
durchase, they would both have more profit, and they could
continue to manufacture their goods, without being reduced
to the necessity of disposing of them, till a proper price could
be obtained.
