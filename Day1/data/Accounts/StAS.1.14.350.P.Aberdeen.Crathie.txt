a scheme carried into execution on such a contracted
scale as 40 guineas a-year; still greater advantages must
be derived from a scheme of this kind, if it was extend-
ed over the whole Highlands of Scotland.
   Afourth disadvantage is, the distance from a port
town, which is 50 miles in any direction*.

   Antiquites.- There is, upon the estate of Castletown of
Braemar, the ruins of an ancient castle, built, tradition
reports, by King Malcolm Kenmore for hunting seat.
By the vestiges which still remain, it is obvious, that
there was a very considerable building.  The house
stood on the top of a rock on the E. side of the water
of Cluanadh; and the King having thrown a drawbridge
across the river, to the rock on the opposite side, the
across of Braemar derived its original name of Ceann-an
drochart from that circumstance.  On a little mount on
the Haugh of Castletown stands the castle of Braemar.
It was originally the property of Farquharson of In-
vercauld, and given to a second son of that family as
his patrimony.  About the end of Queen Mary's reign,
these lands were excambed with the Earl of Marr for
the lands of Monaltry, and, soon after his accession to
the estate, he built the present house King William,
after the Revolution, took possession of it for a garrison,

*I fee with pleasure a branch of the post-office extended from Aber-
deen to Kincardine O'Neil; but this country can derive or no benefit
from it, being still 32 miles distant from the Castletown of Braemar.  Was the
extension this branch to be carried to that place, this whole country, instead
of sending a man weekly to Cupar Angus for letters and newspapers, would
put all their letters into this office to go round by Aberdeen, which would bring
an additional revenue of 3 d. at least, for every single letter, and would, it is
presumed, more than indemnify government for the expenses incurred in the
establishment of it.
