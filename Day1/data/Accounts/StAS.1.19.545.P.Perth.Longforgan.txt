of corn; but they prevent the wind from drying their clay
ground in spring, and winning their corns in autumn,
which they think of much more consequences than any shel-
ter their protection can afford against shaking winds.

this parish, and a considerable quantity of excellent butter,
which are disposed of to private families, especially the

market.  It has been a general opinion, that very good
butter can alone be made from the milk of cows fed upon

years at most:  For here the clover is sown with the barley;
