The holder has as full and indisputable a right to these as
in cases of fee-simple.
   This kind of conveyance is attended with several advan-
tages.  The gentlemen who take the lands in fee do, for
the most part, lay out money largely and judiciously, in
trenching, draining, fencing, planting, manuring, etc.
Large tracts, formerly useless and rugged, are soon convert-

societies in Aberdeen, the face of a rough bleak country is
in several places much altered to the better.
   On property of the same kind around Aberdeen, we,
year after year, behold villas rising, and various improve-

and spots over-run with broom, briars, thorns, and whins.
Now it presents us with a beautiful landscape, of small neat

their lands in fee; a method of transferring property,
which well suits gentlemen who like rural amusements,
but do not chuse to lay out much money on land.  This
country is often inferred with vagrants of various descrip-
