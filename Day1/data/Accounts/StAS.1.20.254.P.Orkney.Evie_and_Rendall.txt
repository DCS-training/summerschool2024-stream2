   Population.-An accurate list of the population of these
parishes was taken up in 1789, when the number of souls 
was 1564.  The lists of baptisms and marriages, taken from
the registers, are as follow:

<TABLE>

Baptisms in Evie.    Males.   Females.
From 1725 to 1735,   123        98
From 1755 to 1765,   139        71
From 1786 to 1796,    93        70

Marriages in Evie.

From 1725 to 1735,    73
From 1786 to 1796,    44

Baptisms in Rendall. Males.   Females.

From 1725 to 1735,    90        64
From 1755 to 1765,    78        79

</TABLE>

   Owing to the distance of Rendall from the minister,
change of clerks, and the people endeavouring to evade the 
trifting dues of registration, especially during the late tax 
on births, etc. no accurate list of baptisms in that parish 
could be obtained for the last ten years, nor any complete 
list of marriages; and no regular register of burials has ever 
been kept in these parishes.
   Many married men go to Hudfon's Bay, and some to the
navy, and leave their wives at home till their return.
   These parishes are tolerably healthy, and pretty free from
contagious disorders, nor are any particular local distempers
known.
