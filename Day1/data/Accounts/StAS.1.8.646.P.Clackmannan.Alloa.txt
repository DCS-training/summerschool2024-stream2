times snow birds.  The lapwing, or green plover, breeds on the
high grounds; but as cutlivation advances, their numbers vi-
sibly decrease.  The hoody, or Royston crow, breeds here.  Jack-
daws, crows, magpies and ravens are often seen, but do not
breed.  There are also hawks, kings-fishers, fandlarks, water
crows, and some few of the long eared bats, owls and screech
owls.

   Antiquities.-About a mile east of the town, there is a
large upright stone, 7 feet 4 inches above the surface of the
ground.  It is three feet broad, and thought to be very deep
in the earth.  The old people use to speak of the figure of a
man on horseback, which they had seen on it.  If any thing
of that kind, or letters (as it is laid), have been formerly ob-
served, they are now totally effaced*.

   Ancient Families and Eminent Persons.-There are no fa-
milies of any consequence now existing, which were originally
of this parish.  The branch of the ABERCROMBLES, which set-
tled at Tullibody towards the end of last century, are descend-
ed from the family of Birkenboig in Banff-shire, where it has
been long established.
   The Lords CATHCART only made this the seat of their re-
sidence, upon parting with the great estate and beautiful place
of Auchincruive, which they possessed for ages in Ayr-shire.

*When the adjacent farm was enclosing, upwards of 20 years ago, a ditch
was made close to the stone, when many human bones were discovered; which
proves, that a battle or skirmish had some time or other taken place near that
spot; and probably some man of eminence was buried hard by, as it was a
common practice of the Pacts on such occasions.  There are two stones resem-
bling this one, in the neighbouring parish of Alva, at no great distance from the
church, but not close to one another.  They are both near the foot of the
ochils.
