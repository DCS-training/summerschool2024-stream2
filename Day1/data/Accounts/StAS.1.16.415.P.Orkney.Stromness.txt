the heritor having the exclusive right to the rabbits.  There
is also what may be called perpetual soil in there parishes,
since it has been cultivated, and has produced crops of bear,
without intermission, for 50 years, neither fallow nor green
crops intervening.  If, with this management, it produces
crops sufficient to reward the farmer's toil, what might be
expected from it, if permitted to rest?  but neither example
or persuasion will convince the farmer of this, nor even the
sweet Mantuan bard's observation,

   Climate.-The air is often raw and damp.  In the south-
ern extremity of the parish of Stromness, along the chan-
nel of Hoy Sound, it is, perhaps, not so raw as in other
parts of this county; the mountains of Hoy attract the
clouds, so that it often rains on that side of the channel,
when the inhabitants on this side enjoy clear weather.
The vicinity of these hills, by attracting the clouds and
vapours, probably produces a quicker circulation, as well as
a purer state of the air, on this side of the channel, which is
conducive both to health and vegetation.

   Diseases.-Coughs, colds, and sore throats, sometimes pre-
vail in winter and spring, especially in rainy seasons, when
the air is not purified by frost, and when long tracts of
easterly winds prevail in spring.  Rheumatisms are fre-
quent, and consumptions sometimes make their appearance.
Scorbutic and cutaneous eruptions are not unfrequent a-
mong people who live in damp houses, and have little
exercise.  The gout is unknown.  The people, on the
whole, are pretty healthy, although there are not many in-
stances of longevity.  Many arrive at the age of 60 or 70
