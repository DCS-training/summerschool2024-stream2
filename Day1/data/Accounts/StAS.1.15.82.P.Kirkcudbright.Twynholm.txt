   Manures.-The manures used are shell marl, sea shells,
water lathing, paring and burning the surface, and dung-
Shell marl, as a manure in this part of Scotland, was first
discovered and used in this parish, it being above 60 years
since it was applied for that purpose.  Of all manures, when
the ground is gently used, and not worn out by the plough,
it remains the longest; its effects are most conspicuous upon
the grass, producing the different clovers, particularly the
white, and grasses of the best quality and kinds; and causing a
great luxuriance in their growth, and deepness of green in
their colour.  The quantity laid upon an acre is from 40 to
60 cart loads, drawn by two horses There is still a large
quantity of this excellent manure in the parish, particularly
in Lord SELKIRK'S grounds.  Sea shells are of two kinds;
those that are brought in by every tide, into the small bay at
the S. corner of the parish, and carted off at the ebb; and a
pretty large bank running along the side bay, and beneath an
arable field, called dry land shells.  The first, wet with a con-
siderable mixture of sand, are heavier to lead, but speedier
in their effect.  The quantity laid upon an acre of each is
from 20 to 30 tons.  Lime brought from England, and land-
ed at the side of the Dee, or the Tarff, costs the farmer 10.
Sterling, the Carlysle bushel of shells, equal to three Wind af-
ter bushels.  From 30 to 70 bushels unslacked are laid upon
an acre.  Leading a stream of water over the surface of a
ley field with the plough or the spade, called water-tathing,
prevailed very much formerly in this parish, before the use
of the forementioned manures became so general, and produ-
ced excellent grain and grass.  It leaves the land hard bound,
and unfit for the other manures, which produce little or
no effect upon water-tathed land; and it cannot be repeated
with any profit but at a considerable distance of time, except
