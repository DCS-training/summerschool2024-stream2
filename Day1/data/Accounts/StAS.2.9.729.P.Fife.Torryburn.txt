  At the north-west corner of the parish, where there is a colliery
now at work, the strata are found dipping to the north-west. The

                     II.-CIVIL HiSTORY.
  There is no record, apparently, of the time when either Torrie
or Crombie was first erected into a parish. The earliest notice
of the former, which we have seen, is in a list of parishes said to
have been drawn up in the reign of King William the Lion, quoted
in a recent publication from Sibbald's History of Fife. Crombie
appears to have been dependent on the Abbey of Culross. In
the " Booke of the Universall Kirk of Scotland," Torrie and
Crombie are noticed as separate parishes in the years 1581 and
1586, and it is thought that their union was effected towards the
close of the same century. One of the first notices in the session
records is an intimation, of date June 21st 1629, that 11 the ses-
sion convened at the kirk of Crombie, appointed ane stent for re-
pairing the kirk of Crombie, extending to 30 lb, to be paid by
parishioners." But there is nothing in the record to enable us to
ascertain whether that church was then, or afterwards, used for
public worship.

Torryburn in the earlier part of tile seventeenth century; for,
June 17th 1632, Alexander Rae was " discharged from teaching
bairns in the parish of Torrie;" and, April 28th 1633, William
