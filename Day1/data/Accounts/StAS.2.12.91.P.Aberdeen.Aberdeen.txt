induce parents to bring their children for vaccination to the Dis-
pensary, led to a proposal to incorporate the two institutions to-
gether, and this was accordingly done in 1837, by the appoint-
ment of the Vaccinator as one of the medical attendants of the
Dispensary, having charge of a district of the town in addition to
his duties as Vaccinator.  The number of children vaccinated at
the institution previous to its junction with the General Dispen-
sary was 6543.
   The only permanent income which the General Dispensary
possesses, except the annual income arising from Mr Burnett's
bequest (which continues to be received by the Vaccinator as his
salary,) is the interest of a bequest of L.400 by the late Mr J.
Cushnie, which was left in 1793 to the two Dispensaries at that
time existing in Aberdeen.  Excepting this, the whole support of
the institution rests on voluntary subscriptions, and an occasional
collection at some of the churches.  Subsequently to the esta-
blishment of the General Dispensary, two others have been set on
foot in Aberdeen.  One in the lower part of the town, whose ob-
ject is principally to provide speedy assistance in the numerous
accidents which happen on board the ships and in the various-
works about the harbour, and the other in the western part of the
town, and altogether beyond the limits of the parish.  The ex-
penses of both of these are borne entirely by voluntary contribu-
tions, and they amount together to about L.60 annually.
   The subjoined table shows the income, expenditure, and num-
ber of patients treated by all the institutions of this sort in town
for the last seven years.

   Lunatic Asylum.-Connected with the Infirmary of Aberdeen,
in so far as it is under the management of the same body of di-
rectors, is the asylum for the reception of lunatics-an institution
which was begun in the year 1799.  Previous to that time there
was no attention paid to the comforts of this unfortunate class in
Aberdeen, and but very little provision made for their safety; the
only accommodations provided being a few miserable cells on the
