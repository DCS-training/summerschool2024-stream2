on the N. by the parish of Tingwall.  The islands of Burra
and House are situated on the W. side of the main land, and
separated from it by a narrow sound.  They he so near to
one another, that there is a communication between them by
a bridge.  They are about 4 miles long, and nearly 1 broad.
Havera, another small island belonging to this parish, is situ-
ated about half a mile to the southward of Burra and Papa,
on the N W.  Bressay contains 366 merks of land, Quarff
93, Burro and Havera 241, in all 700 merks, besides outfets,
which are not in the rentals.  The posture grounds are ex-
tensive, and seed great numbers of sheep, cows, oxen, and
horses.  In some places there are large meadows, which, in
favourable seasons, produce tolerable crops of hay.  The hills
afford excellent peats in great plenty.  The whole rent is

brought in by a foreign ship, prevailed in Bressay, and has

people could not procure proper nourishment to support
them under it, and a considerable number died.  Rheuma-

air, and partly to the alternate heats and colds, to which the
people are necessarily subjected in the prosecution of their
business.  Inoculation for the small-pox has been of late suc-
cessfully used in there parishes.  About two years ago, a
young gentleman inoculated 132 in the isles of Burro and
