     NUMBER XXXI.

     PARISH OF AULDEARN,

     (COUNTY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY, AND PRESBY-
     TERY or NAIRN).

     By the Rev. MR JOHN PATERSON.

   AULDEARN is said by Mr Shaw's history of Moray
to be composed of two Gaelic words, importing the
iron-coloured brook, from a sediment of that colour occa-
sionally thrown out by the brook, which runs westward of
the village.  By other gentlemen skilled in that language,
it is supposed to denote the brook covered with alders, from
the abundance of the trees so denominated, which grew
along the sides of it, and which still grow near it.  It was
formerly a place of much greater consideration than at pre-
sent, and the seat of the Dean of Moray, who presided over
ten canons, and in the bishop's absence presided in the chap-
ters and in synods.  From a grant of the " lands of Penie
(Pethenach juxta Erin per suas rectas divisas)" in this parish
to the Priory of Urquhart, by David I.  its ancient name
seems to have been simply Erin.
