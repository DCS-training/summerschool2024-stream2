village of Bedrule.  There was also formerly a corn mill on
the Tiviot, near Newton, the site of which, in consequence
of alterations occasioned by floods in the course of that ri-
ver, within these 40 years, is now scarcely discernible.  Two
orchards:  One dovecot; but there happens also to be three
very near in the neighbourhood.

   Rooks -The crops suffer less from the beautiful
and useful bird the pigeon, than from the crow or rook,
which seems to increase in number with improvement in
agriculture, and which, as the pigeon, not only devours vast
quantities of grain, but also destroys the potatoe and turnip,
and the most hearty and luxuriant roots of the artificial
grasses; all which, if not so injured, seem to thrive well
in this part of the country.  Might it not be proper, there-
fore, especially for the Board of Agriculture, at least to re-
commend the observance of an old law, passed in the reign of
our James I. respecting these very destructive birds?  For
though, when kept in due bounds, they are believed to be,
upon the whole, rather useful than hurtful, by also devour-
ing slugs and grubs, etc. more concealed enemies of the
fruits of the earth; yet, from their present astonishing num-
bers, and their seeming yearly more and more to increase,
there certainly never were stronger reasons, than at present,
in this part of the country, for the enforcement of that law,
at least, till their numbers be again rendered moderate.  In-
deed, did such an act not already exist, the reasons for it
have here become of late so strong and urgent, as to give
good ground for the enactment of a law to that effect.  As
the act is short, and may not be generally known, we deem
it proper here to insert it.
