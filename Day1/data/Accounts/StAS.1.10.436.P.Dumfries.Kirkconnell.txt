different parishes of this shire and its vicinity, named Kirk-

and of considerable height, which run the whole length of
the parish, from east to west; where they are connected with
Corsencone, in the parish of New Cumnock, a higher hill
than any of them, which terminates the range on that side.

with large flats and deep hollows; and stretching down to

parish, or any country.
