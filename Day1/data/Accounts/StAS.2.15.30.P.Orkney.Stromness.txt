	   Notwithstanding the peculiar temptations to which the peo-
	ple of this parish are exposed, from the great influx of shipping
	and other circumstances, they are, upon the whole, a moral peo-
	ple.  They are most regular in their attendance in the house of
	God; and, though they come far short of that standard which
	the word of God prescribes, and many of them are indifferent to
	their eternal interests, there are still not a few who are alive to the
	great realities of eternity ; appreciate highly their precious privi-
	leges, and study to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all
	things, by maintaining a life and conversation becoming the Gospel.
	   At a former period, smuggling existed to some extent, with its
	demoralizing effects; but now it is rare.

	   The undivided common is capable of very little improvement,
	being mostly bill and moss; and there is much of it, that has been
	rendered incapable of cultivation, by the surface being removed
	from it for fuel and litter,-a practice which still prevails.
