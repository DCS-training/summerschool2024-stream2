General Appendix to [Vol. v.

   The Red Friars, called also Mathurins, and Trinity Friars,
had convents in different parts of the kingdom.  Keith in his
account of the religious houses in Scotland is absolutely cer-
tain from antient charters and records, that they had a con-
went in Brechin, but where it stood, or by whom it was foun-
ded, he cannot say.  Maitland in his History of Scotland
conjectures, that the convent of the Mathurins or Trinity
Friars here, was founded by David the I. who erected the
bishoprick.  The ruins of the abbey or convent, still called
the College, are yet to be seen in the College or Chanonry

Scots; teind wheat, 11 bolls; 14 chalders and 6 bolls of
bear, and 25 chalders and 5 bolls of meal: a great revenue
without all question.
   At the time of the Reformation, Alexander Campbell,
a son of the family of Arkinglass, by the recommendation
of the Earl of Argyle, got a grant of the bishopric of Bre-
chin; while he was yet a boy, with a new and unheard-of
power, to dispose of, at his pleasure, all the revenues, which
belonged either to the spirituality or temporality of the bene-
