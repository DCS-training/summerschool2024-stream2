riding-horses, which are occasionally used in the harrow; some
of the tacksmen have likewise begun to use carts and wains
for carrying manure, but that method of labouring has hither-
to made very little progress.  There is a good deal of the land
ploughed with horses, but still more with oxen, of which there
are about 300 kept for that purpose alone.  The number of
milch cows is above 200, and that of sheep, betwixt 1500 and
2000.  There are likewise a good many swine reared; they
are all consumed in the parish.

are very strict in the exercises of devotion in their families,
and in attendance on public worship, of which there is no form

uncommon appearance in a free nation, and amongst protes-
tants, not owing to any thing peculiar in the inhabitants of Su-
therland, but entirely, to their local situation, and external cir-
cumstances.  However though there be no open schism to di-
