the business of lecturing has generally gone into disuse, or
been reduced to a mere matter of form; as few persons are
willing to labour, who, by doing little, or by following their
amusement, find themselves in easy and comfortable cicum-
stances.  The department of teaching is likely, in suh a
case, to be devolved upon the junior members of the society,
who discharge the office of private tutors; and who, from
the moment they enter upon their office, are ready to consi-
der it as a passing state, and to look forward to that period
when they shall, in their turn, be freed from the dradgery of

pupil is under the immediate eye of the publc, instead of
struggling for distinction and superiority, in their respective
stations, they will be too apt to indulge the laziness, and to
gratify the peculiar humour of each other.  In the Scottish
universities, and particularly that of Glasgow, where the
professors have no benesices in the church, nor any emolu-

interest and zeal, in the discharge of their duty, which are
most likely to call forth the activity and industry of their pu-

   It may be thought, perhaps, that, as necessity is the pa-

prosessors in colleges should have no salaries at all.  This
would be indisputable, if all other employments were left to
the natural profit which they can produce, and were not pe-
culiarly rewarded by fixed appointments from the public.
But if one trade, or art, is allowed a bounty, another must,
Upon this account, have also some compensation.  The pe-
