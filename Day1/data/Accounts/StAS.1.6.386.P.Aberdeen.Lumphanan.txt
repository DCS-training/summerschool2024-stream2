at 9 stone per boll, and 5 bolls of bear.  Sir William Ferbes
of Craigivar, Bart. is patron.  The church was built in 1762.
The manse in 1782.  In the minister's garden are plenty of
geen trees and low fruits, and the trees bear well.  The situ-
ation is pleasant, and so healthy, that there is a proverb, that
no minister dies here.  The glebe may be about 6 acres, but is
strangely and inconveniently divided; some of it lying above
half a miles from the rest.
   There are 4 heritors, one of whom has two thirds of the parish.
The number of poor on the roll at present is only 6.  The weekly
collections are about rod.  We have no other funds except a
few pounds in the Kirk box.  The years 1782 and 1783 ob-
liged the minister and elders to give out L. 10, or L. 12 extraor-
dinary; victual then was very scarce and dear.  A neighbouring
heritor, Mr. William Brebner, was then of great service to
his own, to this, and to other parishes.  He imported,
and brought home from Aberdeen with his own carts, oats,
bear, etc. grinded them, and sold the meal at moderate prices.
Sir William Forbes likewise ordered his factor at Craigivar to
distribute some meal among the poor in his lands, and did not
exact all his rents.  He likewise procured seed for his tenants,
who suffered greatly.  Many were much reduced that year*.
