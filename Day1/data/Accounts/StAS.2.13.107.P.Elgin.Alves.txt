   this day, the people convened and beard the word read," " the col-
   lection for the poor," &c.
      Not only are week days frequently mentioned as having been
   set apart for fasting or thanksgiving; but, likewise, special subjects
   that appeared to call for thanksgiving were often enjoined to be
   remembered on the Lord's day. From the middle of last century,
   the vigorous exercise of church censure seems to have been gra-
   dually relaxed,-so that for a considerable time back, no mention
   is made of any delinquent appearing before the congregation, but
   only before the kirk-session, to be admonished or rebuked. There
   has long prevailed in this neighbourhood a reverence for the Sab-
   bath, and for the ordinances of religion.
                                    III.-POPULATION.
         While Alves included a large portion of Kinloss, the population
   must have greatly exceeded its present amount. Even after that
   time, the number of inhabitants within the present boundaries of
   the parish had been for several generations much greater than what
   it is now. This may be inferred from the following comparison of
   the registrations.
          Old register for the year 1689,_marriages, 16; baptisms, 83.
          Yearly average of the 20 years preceding 1835-marriages, 5; baptisms, 20.
         In like manner, the decrease of population appears from the re-
   turns made at different periods.
   By the returns made to Dr Webster, the amount of population in 1756 was  1691
   By former Statistical Account in                               1793,     1111
   By Government census in                                        1811       922
       Do.          do.                                           1821,      947
       Do.          do.                                           1831,      945
       From the above, it appears that for some time, there had been
   a rapid decrease; after which the amount had become nearly sta-
   tionary. The great alteration in the size of farms, already men-
   tioned, is one of the chief causes of the decrease up to the year 1811-
   Many small crofts were thrown into one large farm; and the sur-
   plus population, no longer obtaining dwelling or employment ift
   their native places, went to swell the numbers in the large towns.

         By census of 1831. Inhabited houses,                                     196
         Number of families,                                                      201
                          chiefly employed in agriculture,                        110
                                               trade, manufactures &c.             44
                    all other families,                                            47
        Language, Habits, &c. of the People.-The language generally
   spoken is the Scotch.  A stranger is struck with the peculiar vowel
   sounds, given in a great many words, as wheit for wheat, feel for
   fool, pure for poor, and wery for very, &c.  Gaelic is not spoken,
   except by strangers.
