roots, some small, many very large, must be digged up.  In
some places this operation must be repeated oftener than once.
Such of these fragments as are unfit for any useful purpose,
are burnt when dry, generally in the months of May and June.
The ashes, with what remains of the moss, and brown earth
formerly mentioned, when judiciously mixt with the clay,
form together one of the best soils.  Some pains are also re-
quisite to level the inequalities, which is best done at first, to
to prevent the water from standing in the hollows.  The clear-
ing away of the spreadfield was formerly done for L. 40 Scots,
or L. 3:6:8 ster. per acre; but since wages have increased,
it will cost from L. 5 to L. 6 ster.  In this manner in a course
of years, a considerable quantity of land has been gained from
the moss, worth from 15 s. to 20 s. ster. per acre.  The carse
soil, in favourable seasons, produces rich crops of every kind
of grain common in this country; particularly wheat, beans
and pease, and oats; barley is not so certain a crop.

   Haugh.-Besides the moss, and the land recovered from it,
there is along the banks of the Forth, a narrow strip of haugh
or holm, which is very fertile, and equally adapted to tillage
or pasture.

   Dryfield.-From the carse, the lands rise at first abruptly,
and then very gradually for about a mile, or more in some
places; continuing flat for a considerable space, they again
decline towards the south.  This elevated part of the parish,
is called the dryfield; a term which is by no means descriptive
of the nature of the soil, but is used merely to distinguish it
from the lower grounds or carse.  Where it first springs from
the carse, it is marked by all those appearances which the
banks of rivers that have been deserved by them exhibit.
