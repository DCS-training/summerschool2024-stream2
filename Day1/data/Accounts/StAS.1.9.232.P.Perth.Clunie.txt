parish.  Around the verge of this island are old ashes and
planes, that have withstood the storms of some hundred
years, yet still continue to vegetate.  These trees have some-
thing venerably grotesque in their appearance.  The trunk
of some of the planes separates and unites again, (forming
a large distinct aperture), as do also some of the larger
branches.  The trees, in some places, diverge considerably
from the land, leaning across the water, over which their
aged arms embrace, and the roots of the planes are incor-
porated with those of the ashes, in such a manner, as if
they were determined to stand and fall together.  In the
fultry heats of summer, these trees throw a cool refreshing
umbrage over the island, intercepting the rays of the fun,
which otherwise, being strongly reflected from the water,
would prove hurtful to the tender eye.  The island itself is
a plain carpet of green, interspersed with a few flowering
shrubs, where the fairies, in the times of superstition, were
wont to hold their moonlight assemblies.
   In the loch of Clunie there is plenty of pike, perch, trout,
and eel.  The eels are sometimes caught here of a consi-
derable size, but they are generally a troublesome capture,
as they are apt to knot and warp the line in an inextri-
cable manner.  In bright funny days, when they come out
near the shore, and are distinctly seen at the bottom of the
shallow water, they are sometimes struck with the eel-
spear, which affords an agreeable amusement.  The trouts
here grow from 4 lb. to 12 lb. weight, but are seldom taken
except on the set line, or in the net.  Vast numbers of the
young fry, both of the trout and perch, are devoured by the
pike.  The perches here are numerous, but generally small,
and they are caught in the usual manner with the rod.
Their best bait is the common red worm, or a small min-
now, and they take very well here in June, July and Au-
gust.  The pike-fishing begins about the end of March,
