reaction, come into view on the one hand, and a limpid
stream, forming a delightful cascade, on the other.  Here
verdant wood, in variegated windings, skirts the sides of
the hills; and there a deep glen, hollowed out by the work
of many ages, lays open to view not a small part of the
bowels of the earth.  In one point of light may he seen the
ruins of an ancient castle*, once the well fortified habita-
tion of a rich and powerful family; and in another, a nu-
merous flock, scattered like snowy specks on the verdant
declivities of the mountains.  Few places in Scotland af-
ford a greater diversity of the grand and picturesque scenes
of nature, grouped together in such pleasing varieties.
This parish is bounded by the parishes of Strathblane and
Campsie, on the S. E.; by New and Old Kilpatricks, on
the S. and S. W.; Drymen and Dumbarton, on the W.;
Balfrone, on the N.; and Fintrie, on the E.  It is by com-
putation about 12 miles in length, from N. E. to S. W.
and 2 1/2, at an average, in breadth.

   Population.-It is inhabited by 206 families, 56 of whom
live in the village of Killearn, which contains 223 persons.
The 150 families residing in the country, reckoning five
individuals to each, will include 750 inhabitants, making
in whole 973 souls.  The population in the year 1755 was
959.  Soon after this time it greatly decreased, owing
chiefly to the demolition of cottages, to each of which was
commonly annexed a paffle of two or three acres of land.
Lately, however, from the rapid advance of trade, the popu-
lation has been greatly on the increase.  By the following
table of births, as they stand inrolled in the parochial re-
cords, it will appear that the present population is not so
great as at a century ago.
