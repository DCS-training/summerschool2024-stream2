dences on which they are made to rest, newspapers and
other periodical publications, are by no means entitled to the
attention and belief of a sincere inquirer after truth.  Even
the great Lord Verulam, when writing on this subject, loses
that acuteness, sagacity, and strength of mind, which he
usually displays, and descends to the level of the weakest,
the most sanguine and credulous, of the speculating philoso-

lying between the Appenine mountains and the river Po,
who had all lived beyond the age of 100, and many of them
to their hundred and thirtieth, or hundred and fortieth year.

years old.  Her friends, when talking of the length of days to
which she had attained, never failed to boast, that she was one
of the celebrated beauties who graced the Court of the Duke
of York, when he resided in the palace of Holyrood-house, in
the reign of his brother Charles II.  Upon the most accurate
investigation, however, of every circumstance that could be tra-
ced, relating to the age of this female, who had long survived
all her contemporaries, it has been found, that she had but just
completed her 99 th year.
