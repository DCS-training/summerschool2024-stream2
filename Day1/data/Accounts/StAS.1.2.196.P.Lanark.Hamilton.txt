lows:  In 1788,-91, in 1789,-120, and in 1790, (which 
was a year uncommonly fatal, an epidemical nervous fever hav-
ing raged for some months,) 167.  The annual average of 
these three years, is 126, to which, about 10 must be added,
supposed to be carried annually to other burying grounds,
making in all 136; so that, about 1 in 37 die yearly.
   The only enumeration of the parish at any former period,
which can now be traced, is that transmitted to Dr Webster,
about the year 1755, which makes the number of souls at that
time 3815.  Hence, the increase of population in the last 40
years, is 1202.  It is probable, that this is the real progressive
state of the population of this district.  There is no doubt,
that the numbers, in the country part of the parish, have dimi-
nished considerably since that period:  for, though new houses
have been built in several places, yet there were then four or
five villages, containing a good number of inhabitants, in
which, there now are very few.  The town, however, has
greatly increased, particularly of late.  An exact list of all the
families in it, was taken in the year 1782, and amounted only
to 805, and, supposing the average number in each family to
be in the same proportion as at present, (little more than 3 3/4)
the increase in the last nine years, is about 564, and in that
time, the country part of the parish has continued nearly the
same.
   It will be obvious, that there is a considerable change of the
state of the place, by taking a comparative view of it at diffe-
rent periods.  Thirty years ago, there were not more than 9
or 10 carpenters and joiners of all kinds in the parish and some
of these, at times, not very well employed.  There are now
about 58 in the town of Hamilton, alone.  Three or four bak-
ers baked all the bread for this, and the neighbouring parishes;
There are now 18 bakers, masters and assistants, in this place,
besides many ovens and bakers in the neighbourhood.  At the
