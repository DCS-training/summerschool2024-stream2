have been introduced, with great advantage, into Sir William
Maxwell's school.  The parochial teacher at Kilbride has the
maximum salary of L.34.  The other parochial teachers have
about L.8 of salary each, the one at Aldhouse having the advan-
tage of a free house provided by voluntary liberality. Sir William
Maxwell allows a liberal salary to the teacher of his school.
   Libraries.--There are two libraries in the parish,--one a parish
library, and the other a subscription library.
   Poor.--The average number of poor yearly on the permanent
roll for the vears 1835-36-37, was 32; not on the permanent roll,
13.  An assessment for support of the poor was first imposed in

years, L.20.  Average amount yearly of assessments for these
years, L.142 ditto of mortifications, mortcloth dues, &c. L.18.

have been of great advantage.
   Savings' Bank.--A savings' bank was instituted a few years ago
in connection with the Glasgow National Security Savings Bank.
It still subsists.
   Inns.--Tbere are 19 inns and public-houses in the parish, the
number of which is unquestionably prejudicial to the morals of the
people.
   Fuel.--Coal is to be found in East Kilbride, but not of the best
quality.  A great deal is brought from Hamilton and Cambuslang.
Peats are to be found in abundance, and are much used.  The ex-
pense of the inferior coal found in the parish or close to it is, in-
cluding cartage to the village of Kilbride, at an average of 4s. 6d.
per 12 cwt.  The expense of the coal from Cambuslang, when
brought to Kilbride, is 8s. 8d. per 16 cwt.
