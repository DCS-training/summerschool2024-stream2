     Statistical Account

parish is exceedingly various, generally thin.  In some places,
it is a fine loam; in others, it is a deep watery till, especial-
ly on the small hills of a conical figure, with which the parish
abounds.  These little hills are all arable; but they render
the surface very uneven.  The most luxuriant crops are pro-
duced, in general, when the ground is well manured with
dung, lime, or marl.  Lime is imported from England at 1 s.
Sterling per Carlisle bushel.  In the north end of the parish,
there is abundance of the finest shell marl.  On the S. and S.
W. borders of the parish, there are some hills, mostly covered
with heath.  The highest of there is steep and rocky, and rises
1100 feet above the level of the sea.

   Climate and Diseases, etc.-Kelton is seldom visited with
those fogs, or noxious damps, which are unfriendly to health.
The air is, in general, dry and salubrious.  No diseases are
known to prevail in the parish, but such as appear in other
places of the country, that are deemed healthful.  Rheumatic
complaints seem to prevail most.  Fevers of different kinds
now and then appear, and sometimes consumptions, etc.  The
ravages of the small pox are greatly prevented by the hu-
mane and successful plan of inoculation.  Instances of longe-
vity have not been a wanting in Kelton.  Seventy is not rec-
koned old age.  Numbers arrive at 80 years, and several at
90, and upwards.  There is a woman now living in the pa-
rish, aged between 97 and 100 years; and a woman died
lately at the town of Castle-Douglas, having reached the long
period of 107 or 108 years.  She remembered King William
the IlI's cavalry passing through this country to Ireland in
1689.  The heaviest rains here are from the S. E., South, and
S. W.; and the strongest winds are from the W. and S. W.
