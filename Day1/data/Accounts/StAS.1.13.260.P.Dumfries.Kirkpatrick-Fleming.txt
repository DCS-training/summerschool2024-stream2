     Statistical Account

was born in the parish of Finglassie, upon the 26th of Sep-
tember 1635, and died upon the 19th of December 1759,
and consequently lived something more than 124 years:
he retained the use of his faculties to the last; has lost none
of his teeth; and had the use of his fight in such perfection,
that he could thread a needle with ease.  Not 2 days be-
fore his death, he travelled six miles upon very uneven
ground; none ever heard him complain of his infirmity,
but he frequently expressed much regret at funerals; en-

is able to walk about, and it times to work a little.

the whole, have considerably increased, though by no
means in so high a proportion, as the present state of po-
pulation and health of the people might have led one to
expect.  This is owing to the greater number of emigrants,
than the influx of strangers, and chiefly to the decay of 2
small villages, which about 20 years ago contained each
upward of 100 inhabitants, and which at present do not
contain both above 45.  As no manufacture is carried on
in this parish, the increase of population must be chiefly
owing to the increasing spirit of agriculture.  Many of
the farms being formerly large, have, by the respective
proprietors, been divided into 2, 3, and some even into
more; and some farms have also been taken in from
moors and commons, which were lately divided.  The
