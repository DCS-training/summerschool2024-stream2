     Statistical Account

the number of souls in 1755 was 1909.-The state of po-
pulation at any former period cannot exactly be ascertain-
ed, there being no list to which a reference can be made;
but at present, from an exact list lately taken, it amounts
to 3218 souls, which in the opinion of the oldest people
in the parish, is more than a third above what it was 30
years ago.  This great increase of population is owing
principally to 3 causes:  1st, The preference given by the
proprietor to the small tenants; 2dly, To early marriages;
and, 3dly, To inoculation, which is now become so general,
that the poor people, to avoid expenses, inoculate their
own children with surprising success.  They are all, with
a very few exceptions, natives of the parish, and of the
Established religion, excepting 4 of the Romish persuasion.
The average of births, deaths, and marriages, cannot be
ascertained for want of a parish register; but the minister
remembers, that during the currency of the year 1792, he
celebrated 25 marriages.  Below, is Table, containing
a list of the inhabitants, classed according to sex and age,
as exactly as could be done, without the help of a re-
gister.
