1770 to 1780 is 40; and for the ten years from 1760 to
1770 is no less than 48; a considerable number of the
married women in the parish being now advanced in life,
accounts for this diminution in the annual number of births.
The annual average of burials for the last ten years is 36.
and of marriages, 11.  The number of souls under ten
years of age is 341; from ten to twenty, 342; from twen-
ty to fifty, 681; from fifty to seventy, 266; and from se-

the increase, owing principally to the accession of inhabi-
tants to the villages from other parishers. The propor-
tion of the annual births to the whole population, is as 1 to
38; of the annual marriages, nearly as 1 to 151; of the 
annual deaths, nearly as 1 to 46; of bachelors to mar-
