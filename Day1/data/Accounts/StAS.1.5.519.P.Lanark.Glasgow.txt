ted, and even now, after the greatest efforts, yields little
more than L. 20 a-year.
   Merchants Hospital.-It is not known, at what time the
merchants of Glasgow first formed themselves into a socie-
ty, but that they had an hospital for the relief of their poor,
previous to the year 1605, is evident from the letter of
Guildry.  Neither can it now be ascertained, what were
the funds of the society at the time;  but, in the year 1659,
this hospital, being found to be in a decayed condition, was
agreed to be taken down, rebuilt, and enlarged;  which was
accordingly done, and the expence chiefly desrayed by
contributiona from the members.  The stock, at that time,
seems to have been about L.2000, but has now arisen,
from payments by the members, and from mortifications,
to above L. 17,000.  Their revenue is at present above
L. 1000 per annum, part of which is employed for particu-

rest is applied for the relief of decayed members, their wi-
dows and descendants.
   Trades Hospital.-The Trades Hospitals also existed be-
fore 1605, and its funds have increased in the same manner.
The present revenue exceeds L. 500, and arises from the in-
terest of their stock, and rents of houses;  together with some
annual payments from the 14 incorporations, each of whom
have a certain number of poor people supported by it.
   Incorporations.-  The different incorporations have also
each of them a revenue and fund of their own, distinct
from the general fund, which is destined for the support of
decayed members, their widows, and children.  And in
the same manner, the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons,
established by charter in 1559, and the Faculty of Procura-
tors, have each considerable funds for the same purposes.
   Hutcheson's Hospital.-  Hutcheson's Hospitals was founded
by George Hutcheson of Lambhill, in the year 1639, and
