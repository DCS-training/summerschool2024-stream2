     of Shotts.

coal, ball iron-stone is found, the balls lying pretty near each
other.  This stone is superior to any thing of the kind, hither-
to found in this part of the country: 3 cwt. of calcined stone
yield a cwt of metal; it smelts also without the help of iron
ore.  Two feet nearer the surface there are two strata of iron
stone, each from 6 to 9 inches thick.  Below the 2 feet
inches of coal, there is another coal 9 feet in thickness, of an
excellent quality.  There is here each day raised 36 tons of
coal, 26 tons of which go to the surnace; the other ten, from
their smallness, being unfit for charring, either serve to blow
the engine, or are fold to the country.  Nine tons of calcined
stone a-day go to the furnace, which casts at the interval of
18 hours, and yields about two tons of pig iron, generally of
an excellent quality.  There is here a cupola blown by the en-
gine, which produces cast work of any form employers please.
Orders of this sort, answered by Colonel Dalrymple, have
given great satisfaction.  The coal is raised here from 18d
to 20d per ton, (the coal falling below 4 inches square ex-
cepted), which brings the miner only 9 1/2 d. a ton: Ball iron
stone in raising 2 s. 6 d: Stratum iron stone 18 d.  There are
employed here 40 miners, besides other 40 smelters and per-
sons otherwise engaged, and 12 horses, The weekly expence
at this work is 801 Sterling, which finding its way to farmers
and workmen of every class in the neighbourhood, improves
their situation beyond what hitherto they had experienced,
in this inland country.  Another iron work is, against the en-
suing spring, (1794,) to be erected upon Mr David Young's
lands of Little Hairshaw, which ly about a mile S. W. of the
kirk of Shotts.  The gentlemen engaged in this work say,
there is throughout the parish of Shotts such a profusion of
coal and iron stone, as might, and in all probability soon will
employ several such furnaces as the one now blown in it.
