streams, when contrasted with the parched desarts of other
climes, may be esteemed one of heaven's greatest blessings;
and, to a commercial people, they are in fact more valuable
than the gold of Mexico and Peru.
   Let the genius of Caledonia, then, be roused by her natu-
ral advantages; let her warlike sons exert their ingenuity
useful discoveries; and let the country, that bravely with-
stood the Roman eagle, be adorned and enriched by useful
arts, and all the prodigies of which science is productive.

     An account of the scheme for NAVIGATING the rivers
     Forth and Devon.

   THE river Forth, in its course from Gartmore to Alloa, a
distance of 27 miles, measured in a straight line, runs wholly
in a level plain of a deep clay soil.  This extent of the river
is naturally divided into two districts: the upper Forth, or
the fresh-water river, which is higher than the rise of spring-
tides; and the lower Forth, or the tideway.
   The part of the upper Forth, which may most easily be
made navigable, commences near Gartmore; and is separa-
ted from the lower Forth by a fall over a rock at Craigforth
dam, where it ends, and the tide-way commences.  It mea-
sures about twenty 20 miles in a straight line, and 33 by
windings of its channel, which is extremely crooked.
   The upper Forth has a narrow channel, with steep sloping
banks.  The surface of the water is generally 20 feet under
the surface of the ground, and the river is mostly deep
there being great districts of it that have always 8 or x 10 feet
water: but these are separated by shallows, some of which
have not more than 2 feet water in the summer time.
