it not being granted, is obliged to carry his fish to Hillswick,
round Rona's hill, the most dangerous navigation on this
coast, at much expense and risk.  South of this, are Col-
lofirth and Quefirth voes, both good harbours, as also Glus
voe.  On the S. end, there is a long inlet of 6 miles, called
Sulum voe, a fine road for ships, and could keep a great
navy.  There are several other smaller harbours, but not so
safe or so much frequented as those now mentioned.
