     Statistical Account

   There is little sea-weed thrown in upon the sandy shore,
but abundance on the neighbouring shores of Ardrossan and
Kilbride, where it is chiefly used as manure to their barley
grounds.  There are very few white fish caught in the open
bay.  From the shores contiguous to Saltcoats, we are suffi-

muddy for a mile round the-mouth of there rivers.  Every
appearance indicates, that, at a very remote period, the sea
covered the whole tracks, for the upper soil is loose sea land,
without a stone in it-that, at a less remote period, perhaps se-
veral centuries ago, the sea covered the lower part of the track
nearest Saltcoats, washed the whole rocky ridge above de-
scribed, and stretching N. E. through low marshy grounds,
went within less than a mile of Kilwinning, and thus left the
east part of Stevenston sand hills more elevated than the rest,
together with part of the parishes of Kilwinning and Irvine, in the
form of a circular island, three miles in diameter, surrounded
either totally by the sea, or in part by the Garnock, which
seems to have then held a more westerly course than at present,
The proofs of the insular situation of that part of the coast,
and that it was probably a deer island, are these-The anchors
of boats dug out of the lower marshy grounds-The name of
the estate of Patrick Warner, Esq; the proprietor of a great
part of the track, Ardeer, (the only Gaelic name in the parish)
-The old house stood on a part at the rocky ridge, which juts
out beyohd the rest like a promontory-Two pair of branching
deers horns, lately found; one pair with part of the scull
sticking to them, dug out of the ground 30 feet deep; the
other at a less depth, discovered by the course of Stevenston
burn; both now in the possession of that gentleman-A cave
under ground, discovered about two years ago, near the same
gentleman's house, or a cavity in a solid rock of free stone, 24
feet long, 12 wide, and 6 high.  The stone in the bottom of
this cave, and in the sides, two feet up, is polished or worn
smooth in such a manner, as leaves no doubt that it must have
been washed either by the waves of the sea, now above a mile
distant, or by the course of a river.  The river is above
three miles distant.-Lastly, An old atlas, said to have been
in Eglinton Castle about the beginning of this century, in
which there was a chart of the coast, exhibiting this insular ap-
pearance.  It is doubtful, however, whether this change be so
recent that it could appear in any chart; but the fact itself
seems sufficiently established.
