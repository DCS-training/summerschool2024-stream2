   Prior to 1792, there was an annual importation of iron
from Sweden of about 30 tons; since that time it has been
brought coastways from Leith and Aberdeen, and the quan-
tity is supposed nearly the same.
   Tiles, bricks, and slates are imported, supposed to the va-
lue of L. 6 co Sterling each year.
   From the variety of packages, and incorrect manner of
clearing out bale goods at the Customhouse, it is impossible
to ascertain the quantity of goods under that denomination;
but from Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, Carron, Glas-
gow, etc. they may be estimated at L. 6000 Sterling an-
nually.  The gross amount in value of goods brought hither
from London, in groceries, teas, hops, flour, grafs-feeds,
porter, and many other necessaries and luxuries of life for
there three last years, is supposed to be L. 12,0000 each
year.
   It is supposed there is not less than 9000 lb. of tea im-
ported.
   From 20 to 24 pipes of red Port and white wine are im-
ported by way of Leith; 22 pipes, at L. 50 Sterling each
