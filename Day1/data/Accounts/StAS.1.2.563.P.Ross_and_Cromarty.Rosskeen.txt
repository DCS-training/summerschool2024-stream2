to be attributed to the Society's schools, which have been en
dowed in the height of the parish.
   There are unbounded tracts of excellent peat moss in
the higher, and some mosses of considerable extent in the
lower district of the parish.-No species of manufacture has
as yet found its way to this part of the country, though few si-
tuations are to be found so well adapted for their introduc-
tion.
   There is a village of some extent upon the Ness of Invergor-
don, on a dry heathy beach, where vessels of 100 tons bur-
den can lye with safety, most seasons of the year, and receive
or deliver their cargoes close to the shore.
   Services of tenants are in general converted, at the rate of
one sixteenth part of the annual land rent.  The rents in gene-
ral are paid in kind, or in bear or barley, and oat meal, with
kains or customs.
   The rent of the parish may be about L. 2000 sterling, con-
verting the boll of bear and meal ar 12 s.
   The spinning of linen yarn is carried on to a considerable
extent, though, it must be said, with very little advantage to
the people, or to the country, it being done by commission
from more southern districts, whither the yarn is transmitted
to be wove, or otherwise manufactured; so that, by passing
through so many hands each of whom must have a small profit,
little can be afforded to the spinners, who, though expert and
industrious, do not earn above 2 1/2, or most, 3 d a day, from
their labour.  But this perhaps may be soon altered, as Mr
M'Leod, the proprietor of the village above mentioned, is
willing to encourage settlers, for that purpose, and gives per-
pectual feus of ground, sufficient for a house and small garden,
on moderate terms.  They may also have as many acres of
land in lease, as they may find it convenient to cultivate.
