     Statistical Account

ton-works have inspired the whole country with industry
and exertion for several miles around.
   Although we have two butchers, little butcher-meat is
killed in the place: at certain seasons, we are supplied from
Ayr and Kilmarnock.  A butcher of knowledge, and a
little ready money, would find this an advantageous situa-
tion for his profession.  A mail-gardener is much wanted:
greens and roots are brought on Saturdays from Kilmar-
nock, at the distance of 12 miles.  There are several very
proper places for a garden of this kind, in the vicinity of
the village, and which Mr Alexander, for the good of the
place, would let on reasonable terms to a man of character.
There are 30 feuers in the village.  From the commence-
ment of the cotton manufacture here, to the year 1789, the
rate of feuing was 4 d. per fall, for a house and yard; from
that period to this, it has been 6 d. per fall.  The feu is
perpetual.-A room 16 feet by 14 lets at L. 1, 10 s.; or,
when finished in a superior stile, L. 2 annually.  The great
road from Dumfries to Glasgow, by Sanquhar, Old Cum-
nock, Mauchline, etc. passes the village, in less than a quar-
ter of a mile.  Mauchline is the nearest post-town, and di-
stant 3 miles.-Persons accidentally hurt in the Company's
service are allowed medical assistance, and their full wages,
till they recover.
   On account of the importance of this new establishment,
and the attention paid to the health and comfort of its in-
habitants, it was thought proper to lay before the reader,
the annexed engraving of it, with the following explanation
of the particulars therein contained.
