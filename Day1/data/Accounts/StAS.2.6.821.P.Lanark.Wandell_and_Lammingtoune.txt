directly into their own country; and having in company reached
Moffat, they separated about Errickstane, into two parties of near-
ly equal numbers; one division resolving to pursue their  way
through Crawford-muir towards Douglas, while the remaining
200 took a more easterly course, and crossed the hills in the
direction of Lammingtoune.  Two countrymen of Annandale
observing their movements, and conjecturing whither they were
bound, hastened it is said by night to Lammingtoune, and appriz-
ed the people of their approach. " Early next morning, the 2d of
November, the lairds of Lammingtoune, Nisbet, Glespine, Moss-
castle; a Bailie Vallance from Biggar, a Mr Mitchell, factor to
the laird of Hartree; a Mr Baillie, in Moat, and other gentle-
men, with a great multitude of the surrounding parishes, as well
as the men of Lammingtoune, forthwith assembled, both horse and
foot, all of them armed as well as the hurry of the moment
would permit," It is said they found the poor Highlanders in dif-
ferentpartie, among the hills above Lammingtoune village; and that,
had the latter only made a determined resistance, the greater part
of the Clydesdale men would soon have fled, as " the hands of
many of them were shaking with fear;" but, the poor strangersbe-
ing worn out with cold, hunger, and fatigue, were soon induced to
surrender, and being collected to the number, as already stated,
of about 200, they were driven before the country people, (who
were armed with every sort of rude implement, and had now, when
all danger was part, recovered a wonderful degree of courage,)
and were at last safely cooped up for a day and night in the pa-
rish kirk, and next day marched off to Lanark.
