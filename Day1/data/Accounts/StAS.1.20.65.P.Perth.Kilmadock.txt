   5. Straightening Marches and Burns.-There can never be
any real improvements while the marches are crooked and
irregular.  As heritors have the authority of an act of Parlia-
ment for compelling their neighbours to straighten marches,
there is no excuse for allowing any to remain uneven.  The
irregularity of marches is always an objection against in-
closing, and the source of endless strise between the tenants.
   In the parish of Kilmadock the marches are shamefully
irregular.  The estate of Cambuswallace was lately inclosed,
and the marches straightened, which has had a wonderful
effect on the prosperity of the farmers.  By the advantages
of inclosures and straight marches, the tenants are able to
pay an advance rent, andlive much better than when
their rents were low, and the ground open and irregular.
   The straightening of small burns and rivulets is an impor-
tant article.  These feeble streams are generally fond of
wandering along a multitude of serpentine windings, occu-
pying an immense stretch if lengthened out in a straight
line.  By casting a straight ditch in the centre, the whole
ground occupied by the windings would be gained, and the
links, formerly sanded and useless, could be converted into
arable land.  Of all other soils these haughs are the richest.
They would produce all kinds of grain in perfection, parti-
cularly flax; and, when laid down in grass, no pasture would
be equal, either for shelter in time of storms, or for succu-
lent food in time of drought.
   6. Dividing Run-rig Lands and Commons.-There were
several farms in this district run-rig, and large tracts of
waste common moors, not long ago, but these are all now
exchanged and divided, which may be considered the hap-
py prelude of future improvements.
