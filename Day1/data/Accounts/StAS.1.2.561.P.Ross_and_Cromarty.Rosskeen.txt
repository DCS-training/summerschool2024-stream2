   Climate and Longevity.-The climate varies in different parts
of the parish; it is often mild and temperate, and all kinds of
farm work can be carried on in the lower part of the parish,
when, in the heights, these operations are interrupted by hard
frost, or a fall of snow.-It is, however, upon the whole,
a healthy parish, and many instances occur of great longevity.
There are at present many inhabitants, both male and female,
above 80 years of age; and, what is remarkable, there are 3
members of the session, whose combined ages amount, at this
times, to 260 years.

   School.-The parochial school has been built near the Ness
of Invergordon, which affords the village there another advan-
tage.  It is, however, far from being centrical, and is, from
that circumstance, much less attended, than otherwise it
would be.  The school house, and accommodation for the
teachers, are sufficiently commodious.  The schoolmaster's sa-
lary is about L. 15 per annum, which, with perquisites usual-
ly attached to the situation, makes it worth about L. 25, per
annum.

   Poor.-The number on the poors list is 70, which are di-
vided into classes, according to the degree of their respective
necessities; and the very small fund, allotted for their relief,
is divided quarterly amongst them.-In this parish, there is
hardly any fund, but the collections made in the church, af-
ter performance of divine worship: and as very few, indeed,
of the heritors reside in the parish, this seldom exceeds L. 10
per annum, from which there is a deduction of L. 2: 10 sterling
to the session-clerk, and a very considerable one for bad half-
pence, collected, so that the share of each poor person must
be very small.
