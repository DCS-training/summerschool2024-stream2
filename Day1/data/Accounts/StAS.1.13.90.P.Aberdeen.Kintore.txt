     Statistical Account

On this road, over the Don, about three years ago, was built
a very elegant bridge of three arches, the middle arch 65 feet
wide, and the other tow 55 feet each.  There are also brid-
ges over all the brooks on the highways.  The roads are bet-
ter in this parish than in many parishes around, as we have 
much sand and gravel for making them; and on the ground 
between Kintore and Inverury, the soil being sandy, the
road needs no making at all.  Ther roads are made by the
statute-labour, or commuted at 1 s. 6 d. for the fix days*.

   Forests.-There have not been for some centuries, any
remains of the old forests, only large trunks of black oak
have been often found in the river and haugh; the mosses
abund with fir, an oak roots very large are found in the
neighbourhood.  A large plantation of fir and other wood
planted near the castle of Hall Forest, in the memory of ma-
ny persons yet alive, is now all cut down and the ground
planted again; the fir wood of it was reckoned the best of
our low country wood, and the present Earl of Kintore,
since he came to the estate and honours in 1778, has plant-

considerable plantations of Scotch fir, well grown, on the

*Names of Places.-The old names of places are generally Gaelic,
such as Greechie, Tillihin, Drumnaheath, Blairs, Anguhiten, Dalwearte,
and probably Tavelty, the old road to Aberdeen, called the Rusthlacb,
part of the present road called the Skair, the fords Tillikae and Pit-
curn, with many names of fields. On the extremity and top of an hill
bordering with Skene, is Wardhouse, and English name, which, though it
has no vestige of a camp, nor of an house better than ordinary, has pro-
bably had a watch and guard kept on it in perilous times; for this, the 
situation described before, renders it very proper, especially, as it stands
on ground nearly as high as any in the parish, and has an extensive pro-
spect both to north and south, and many hills at a distance are seen
from it, even the Grampian hills, and to the north, much of the Garioch.
