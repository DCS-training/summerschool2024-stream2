are thought to be sufficiently hardy to withstand the severi-
ties of the winter.  But whatever solidity may be in this
opinion, (which might and ought to undergo the test of ex-
periment), it seems certain, that they would be safe if sown
in February, or early in March.  If they were sown at that
early period of the spring, one great advantage would result,
they would ripen at an earlier period of autumn, and thus
the inconveniences and losses of a late harvest would be
avoided.  Besides, long and general experience has proved,
that the grain of a crop which has been early sown and ear-
ly ripened, is better than that of a crop which in both these
respects has been later.
   The Blainslie oats, the Friesland, which ripens 3 weeks
earlier than the Blainslie, but is shaken more easily, and the
Tartarian, which, though rather later than the other two,
is more prolific than either, and resists the most shaking
winds; these oats ought to be preferred to all other for seed
in this climate and soil.
   Four rowed barley, and the 6 rowed where it can be pro-
cured, are superior to the double-rowed, for Dowally; and
winter rye should be sown in place of spring rye.  The for-
mer yields the richest crop, the grain is better, and the
straw stronger.
   Wheat should not be attempted in this soil.
   Vetches may be sown on a barley or oat-stubble, if the
field can be prepared for them by the middle of September.
They will afford a convenient supply of green provender,
at a time when it is much needed, and if turnip follows
them, the farmer, in the course of two years, will have from
the field three crops.
   Ruta baga, or Swedish turnip, ought to be introduced, as
a most valuable plant.  It thrives with the same culture as
the common turnip.  Being a biennial, it never flowers the
