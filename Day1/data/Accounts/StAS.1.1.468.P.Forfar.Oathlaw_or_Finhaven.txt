   Price of Labour and Provisions.-The increase of labourers
wages in husbandry, since the year 1740, has been very great.
For 20 years after that period, their wages were from L. 2 
to L. 3 a year; at present they are from L. 5 to L. 10 a
year, and maintained, as formerly, in the family.  Women
servants wages, during the period already mentioned, were
L. 1: 10: 0; they are now from L. 3 to L. 4.  Day labour-
ers, at the same period, got 2 1/2 d.; at present they get from
8 d. to 10 d. exclusive of victuals.  Harvest wages for the
season are from L. 1 to L. 1: 10: 0; by the day 1 s. and
victuals.  Oatmeal is the principal food of the labouring peo-
ple.  The price of it, from 1740 to 1760, was about 8 s. and
10 s. 6 d. a boll; at present, and for some years past, it has
been from 12 s. to 14 s.  The general mode of living was
much the same at both periods.  Butter is from 6 d. to 9 d. a
pound.  Cheese from 5 s to 6 s. a stone.

are 2 chalders of victual.  The manse, offices, and garden, are
estimated at L. 6 Sterling, and the glebe at L. 4.  The patron
of the parish is Lord Aboyne.

   Antiquities.-There is a vestige of a camp, supposed to be
Roman.  Its dimensions are 1200 yards in length, and 600
in breadth.  There are 2 tumuli in it, which have never been
opened.  According to tradition, it was part of a great fo-
rest, called the Forest of Claton, which extended from Fin-
haven to Kirriemuir, about the distance of 6 miles.  The site
of the camp is now a well cultivated farm, called Battle-dykes.
The names given to the other farm houses on the forest are
descriptive of its former situation, such as Birkenbush, Drake-
mire, Forrester-Seat, King's-Seat, Wolf-Law, etc.
