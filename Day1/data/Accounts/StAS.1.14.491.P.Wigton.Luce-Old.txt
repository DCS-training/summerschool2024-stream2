     Of Old Luce.

enmalg, the bay of Kirk-Christ, and the small river of
Pooltanton, which unites with the river of Luce within
high-water mark, are the landing ports.  The bay of
Auchenmalg might, at no great expense, be made a very
safe harbour for vessels of considerable burden; but there
is not sufficient depth of water in Pooltanton for vessels
above 60 or 70 tons to get into a place of safety, even at
the highest spring tides, and perhaps it would not be prac-
ticable to make it better; but it is the best of the three
at present, for the other two afford no protection in a
strong gale of wind from the S.

   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-About one half of the parish
is not arable, but it produces pasture for sheep and cattle.
The arable part of the soil is dry, light, and grateful,
when properly managed; but the spirit of improvement
was very late in making its appearance in this parish; for
within there 20 years, only 1 farmer or 2 had a cart: at
present, every man has a cart or carts, in proportion to
the extent of his farm.-A common round of labour
which had taken place, was till lately invariably pursued,
viz. there was a bear fey, or piece of land allotted for
bear, upon which the dung collected in the farm was an-
nually laid, and laboured from time immemorial.  The
crop was a mixture of weak bear and gray oats.  The oat-
lands received no manure (the partial spots excepted, on
which the cattle and sheep were folded through the night
in summer), were laboured 3 years, and relied 6: the pro-
duce was grey oats, of which a Winchester bushel would
only have yielded 6 lb. of meal; or if it gave a pound or
two more, it was thought remarkably good grain*.  A

in the present; for wheat and barley (hordeum) are then mentioned amongst
