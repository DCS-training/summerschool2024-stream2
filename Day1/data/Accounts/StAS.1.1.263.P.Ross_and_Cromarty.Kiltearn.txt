     of Kiltearn.

It is a providential circumstance, that the people are seldom
visited with such a calamity.  The epidemical disease most
dreaded is the natural small-pox, which usually sweeps away
a number of children once in seven years, and sometimes
oftener.  In the year 1777, above 30, and in 1778 no sewer
than 47 children died of this disease.  There is not the lease
doubt that this great mortality was owing in part to the
improper treatment of the patients, and the neglect of ino-
culation, to which the people are still averse, in spite of
the earnest persuasion and example of their superiors, con-
firmed by a successful practice in almost every instance where
it has been attempted.  Rheumatic complaints have also bee
more frequent than formerly  wihtin these 30 years, owing
probably to the substitution of linen for flannel shirts among
the lower ranks; and a return to the use of flannel and
woolen is found to be the most efficacious remedy for this
complaint.

   Before we conclude this article, it may be proper to ob-
serve, that the following instances of longevity, which seem
to be well attested, afford a very favourable testimony of the
healthfulness of the air and climate of this parish.  About
the year 1706, Katharine M'Kenzie died at Fowlis in the
117th year of her age.  In 1782, Mr John Brown, late
fastor of Foulis, died in his 107th year.  In 1775, Kenneth
Munro, late of Inveran, died in this parish, in his 100th
year; and Mrs Munro, his wife, died 4 years after him,
in her 88th year.  The only instance which we shall add is
a gentleman, a heritor of the parish, who had been a member
of the last Scoth, and of the first British parliament; he
died about 30 years ago, in his 94th year.  And, within these
few years, a sister and daughter of the same genetleman died 
here, who were very little short of the same ago.
