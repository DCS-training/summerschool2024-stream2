of this country.  Both these rivers produce trout.  Those
found in the Methven, are fatter, and much better, than those
found in the Clyde; which is, no doubt, owing to the rapidi-

beautiful, or smooth hill: And indeed, it is one of the most
beautiful little hills, that is to be seen in any country.  It is a-
bout 600 feet above the level of the Clyde, and is green to the
very top. On this hill, the common people, to this day, point
out, with much fond admiration, WALLACE's chair, where he
had his abode, and held conferences with his followers, before

563; the annual average of which, is a little more than 3.-
