     of Symington.

Shanky was serving; and likewise a mastiff belonging to a
carter, who was passing by on the Monday.  The farmer be-
gan to take some precautions.  Accordingly, the dog was
chained down in a separate house, where he refused food, and
died in a few days.  The other dogs attempted, some time after,
to bite people, The mastiff turned mad, and was killed.-
Shanky says, that his mind was now filled, day and night,
with the most dreadful apprehensions, and he laid his account
with the most horrible kind of death.  In three weeks, one
cow was seized with the disease, and the others soon after,
till 10 of them died.  He says, that the cattle foamed at the
mouth; their sides went like a pair of bellows; their dung
became of the consistency and colour of tar, and their hind
legs failed, so that they fell down and died.  The family, being
interrogated on the subject, agree exactly with Shanky; and
as he, and John Barclay, in the parish of Lamington, whom
he was serving at the time, are men of undoubted veracity,
no matter of fact can be better ascertained; and there is no
question but the hot lime from the kill operated the cure.
