down small particles of iron into the loch, and that the
N. W. wind lands them upon the opposite S. E. shore;
out of one pound we can extract by the magnet 1/3 of black-
iron particles, nothing inferior to that which is imported to 
us from Hungary.  Woods we have none in this country;
and it is the opinion of the writer, that there never were
any.  He has been at considerable pains to investigate the
mode in which the several trees found here made their ap-
pearance, but could never find one root in an horizontal
direction, as the roots of trees are placed in other parts of
the kingdom where wood has grown; all were deposited 
in the earth, lying sideways in swamps, and appear to
have been conveyed thither (however distant the period) by
water.  He is more confirmed in this opinion, when he
considers that no wood will thrive here above the garden
walls.  To this may be added, that hazzle, mountain-ash,
and elder shrubs, are found in the mountains, some miles
from all sea, but they never grow above 8 or 9 inches high,
and not 2 inches thick; which can be attributed to no other
cause, but that the air from one side of the country to the
other, is so impregnated with saltish particles, as to stop
vegetation in a great measure, unless (as said above) where 
there is a shelter.  There are also found in the island some
veins of copper-ore, and we have great reason to believe,
that there is black lead, but our small finances prevent us
from working them.  There is also found here the lapis 
asbestinus of the filamentons kind, and some few garnets,
and a huge quantity of fullers earth, and pieces of rock-
crystal, also some limetone very poor in quality, one small
vein excepted*.
