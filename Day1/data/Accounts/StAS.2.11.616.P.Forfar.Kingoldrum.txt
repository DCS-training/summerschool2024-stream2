nals might be given on the approach of an enemy, is uncertain.
Stone coffins have occasionally been found in the fields. On tak-
ing down the old church, various stones, on which singular devices
had been cut, were discovered imbedded in the building.  Two
stones on which crosses are finely carved, with accompanying
hieroglyphics, may be particularly mentioned.  These stones it is
probable had their origin about the time of the introduction of
Christianity into our country, and would seem to be a connecting
link betwixt Pagan mythology and Christian worship.  Several
rude relics which may have been esteemed precious in the time of
Romish supremacy were likewise found.
  Mansion-Houses.-The mansion-house of Baldovie occupies a
highly agreeable and well sheltered situation. It is ornamented
by wood, and a great part of the land in its neighbourhood is of
the richest description. The house of Pearsie is still more plea-
santly situated and ornamented.  The farm-houses that have been
erected within the last twenty years have been greatly improved
in appearance and accommodation.

                        III.-POPULATION.
  The population of the parish has very much decreased in
amount. Several small villages have entirely disappeared, and the
sites of cottages to about the number of fifty, once the residence
of a hardy, industrious, and attached peasantry, can now with dif-
ficulty be traced.

<TABLE=POPULATION>

     According to Dr Webster the population was                780
     About the year 1796,                                      600                                    1811,
                    1811,                                      537
                    1821,   males,256,   females, 261,  Total, 517

                    1841,     do. 232,      do.   208     do.  440
     The yearly average of births for the last 7 years may be from 16 to 20
     The average of burials for the last 20 years is, per annum,          6 1/4
                    marriages,                                            3 4/5
     The number of families,                                             89
                    inhabited houses,                                    74

    The decrease of population has been principally owing to the
union of farms, and to the removal of the smaller tenants to the
neighbouring towns, who have gone there in search of employ-
ment; but who, in many cases, have eventually returned to in-
crease the pauperism of our district. The evils of this system of
depopulation are now beginning to be severely felt by the farmer,
who, in the season of harvest, has to depend for assistance on the
uncertain supply of the neighbouring towns.  Mr Wedderburn
of Pearsie has lately built several neat cottages, which are not.
