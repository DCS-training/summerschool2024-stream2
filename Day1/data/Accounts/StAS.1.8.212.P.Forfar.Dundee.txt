     Statistical Account

two batallions of Lord Duff'us's regiment are said to have been
slaughtered; and, another body suffered the like fate, in the
square called the fish-market.  No unusual provocation ap-
pears to have been given to this severity.  On the contrary,
Mr. Gumble, general Monk's chaplain, and who writes his
life, speaks in high terms of the governor, for his gallant and
brave defence.  His head was, notwithstanding, cut off and
fixed upon a spike, in one of the abutments at the south west
corner of the steeple; and, till a few years ago, when the
stone where the spike was inserted, fell down, the remains of
it were observable.  The same indignity appears also to have
been done to others.  It is a tradition here, that the carnage
did not cease till the third day, when a child was seen in a
lane, called the Thorter-Row, sucking its murdered mother.
Several persons also, on this occassion, were carried prisoners
to London, probably along with the 300 officers surprised by
Monk's Colonels, Alured and Morgan, at Alyth, when, col-

Mr. Andrew Affleck, the parson, or first minister, and Mr.
John Robertson the Vicar.  They were detained at London
till spring 1653; and, after their return Mr. Robertson
was some time confined in the common prison of Dundee.
Mr. Afflect was ancestor to the two brothers, Admiral and
Captain Affleck in the royal navy.  The date of this merci-

   Though no probable account can be given of the popula-
tion in remote times, the town of Dundee appears to have
been long ago a place of considerable note.  Edward I.
thought it of sufficient consequence to be occupied by an
English garrison; and, the illustrious WALLACE, (with his
companions John Blair, probably of the Balthayock family,
and Sir N. Campbell of Lochow,) is said, by tradition, to have
received his education at the Dundee school, and in this situa-
