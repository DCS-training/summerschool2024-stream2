tages would have resulted from the Societies being kept up.  An
instance of this extraordinary spirit has recently shown itself among
the members of the Seamen Friendly Society, formerly the
Pilot Society.  The funds of this Society amount to about L.1500;
both the contributors and those receiving relief are comparatively
few in number, and many of the former are in the better ranks of
life.  In the course of the present year it has been resolved to dis-
solve this Society, and divide the funds.
   At present the following Societies, much to the credit of the
members, exist in the town:-
