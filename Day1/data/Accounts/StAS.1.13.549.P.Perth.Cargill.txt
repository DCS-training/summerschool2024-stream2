     of Cargill.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 3 dissilleries in
this parish, but no brewery.  The high duties on malt
have almost abolished the practice of brewing.  The use
of whisky is encreasing, that of beer diminishing.  Few pri-
vate families brew their own beer.  There are 5 licensed 
publick houses in the parish.  It is not observed, that they
have any remarkable tendency to corrupt the morals of 
the people.  There are 3 corn-mills, 1 lint-mill, and 1
wind-mill for beetling cloth.  There are no remarkable 
birds or animals here, but such as are common to the
counrty in general.  The names of the places are mostly
local, and of Gaelic original.  The language now in use is
the English.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-Our distance from mar-
kets, and the means of improvement, the great expense
of land carriage on that and every other commodity, to-
gether with the badness of our roads,  check the rising spi-
rit of agriculture, and retard the progress of improvements
in this parish.  The want of fuel also, is another great dis-
advantage under which this place labours, being 30 miles
from the nearest coal-pit, and 9 miles from the port
Perth.  The shortness of the leases here also, in an impro-
ving country, where so much remains to be done, affords
neither time for extensive improvements, nor encourage-
ment for expensive operations.  These natural disadvan-
tages are somewhat counterbalanced by a grateful soil, and
temperate climate, which raises good grain, and ripens it,
were proper encouragement allowed for improvements,
and longer leases granted, upon progressive rises of rent.
The abolition of all services, and not being astricted to any
mills for multure, are advantages enjoyed by this parish.
