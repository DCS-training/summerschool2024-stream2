     Statistical Account

   The measurement exceeds 10,000 acres.-Along the shore,
to the extent of a mile into the country, the soil is generally 
good, partly clay, partly loam, or mixed.  In many other 
places, are rich and fertile fields of a similar soil.  The rest 
of the parish is more gravelly:  The arable land, especially in 
the upper division, in intermixed with mosses and muirs, co-
vered with heath or coarse grass.

   Sea Coast, Rivers, Fisheries.-The sea coast extends about
4 miles; nearly two of which, to the south of the town, are 
low and sandy, bounded by hillocks overgrown with bent.
The rest is rocky and flat; except Kinnaird's-head, a high 
land projecting into the sea, thought to be the Promontorium 
Taixalium of Ptolomy, being the turning point into the 
AEsluarium Vararis, or Murray Firth.-From it the land tends 
due west on the one hand, and makes a curve to the south-
east on the other, forming a part of the bay of Fraserburgh.-
On this coast, considerable quantities of sea-weed, cut off the 
rocks, are manufactured into kelp.  The sea has receded 
from the land in some places, and encroached on it in others. 
-Westward of Kinnaird's-head, is a stony beach, evidently
thrown up by the sea, 30 ells from, and 3 ells above, the 
present high water mark.  Many of the benty hillocks, which 
skirt the bay, stand upon moss or clay; and in 1760, a tree 
with roots and branches, and a stem 20 feet long, was found 
entire, under the sand within the high flood mark.  By a 
strong south east wind, the sands on this shore, if dry, are 
drifted; and if not intercepted by the bents, would overspread 
the adjacent fields.  Bent ought, therefore, carefully to be 
preserved; especially a very fine sort, which has lately ap-
peared in this bay, resembling the river bulrush in length of 
joint, thickness of reed, and largeness of leaf and top.  It in-
creases in quantity, and grows down to high water mark.
