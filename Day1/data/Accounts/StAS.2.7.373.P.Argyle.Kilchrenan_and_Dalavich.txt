                II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
Antiquities.-Opposite to, and in sight of, the parish church of
Dalavich, lies the beautiful island of Inish-Chonnel, on which
stands a majestic ruin of great antiquity, covered over with ivy,
and which was for several centuries the chief residence of the fa-
mily of Argyle.  Near Inish-Chonnel lies Inish-errich.  In this
isle are the ruins of a chapel, together with an ancient burying-
ground, still used as such.  Not far from this is Eilean 'n tagart
or Priest's Isle, so called from having been the residence of the priest.
Lochavich, anciently called Lochluina, and whicb discharges it-
self into Lochawe by the stream or water of Avich already noticed,
is a beautiful sheet of water, of a triangular form, about eight
miles in circumference, full of trout, having one castle and se-
veral islands, the resort of gulls, cranes, water-eagles, and wild-
ducks.  Near this lake lay the scene of an ancient Celtic poem,
translated by Dr Smith of Campbeltown, called Cathluina, or the
conflict of Luina ; and in the lake is an island, the scene of an-
other poem, called Laoi Fraoich, or the Death of Fraoch.  Many
places in this neighbourhood are still called after the names of
some of Ossian's heroes.
