     The Arbuthnot.

   The general character of the people is industrious and so-
ber, little disposed to change of place or employment.
Hence the population has been so stationary.

   Ecclesiastical State.-With respect to the ecclesiastical state
of the parish: The Viscount of Arbuthnot is patron of the
church.  The clergyman has a living of 64 bolls of meal
and bear, and about 42 l. Sterling, besides a small glebe of
little value.  The present incumbent was settled in the year
1780.  The church is a very antient fabric of ashlar work,
but now in very bad repair.  The manse is almost ruinous,
but is about to be repaired.  To the church is adjoining an
ayle of beautiful antique workmanship, which was built by
an Alexander Arbuthnot, (designed, in the appendix to Spo-
tiswood's History), brother to the Baron of Arbuthnot, and
parson of Arbuthnot and Logic Buchan.  He was elected
the fist Protestant Principal of the King's College, Aber-
deen, in the year 1569.  The lower part of this ayle was in-
tended, and has been used as a burial place for the family of
Arbuthnot.  And in the upper part was a web finished a-
partment, filled with books chiefly in divinity, many of
which remained there till of late.  This was Mr Arbuth-
not's library, which he bequeathed for the use of the clergy
of the Mearns.  There are 42 Episcopalians in the parish,
and no other dissenters.

   Poor.-The number of poor in the parish is about 20.
The provision for them consists of the collections at the
church, amounting annually to about 16 l. and the interest
of some mortifications and seat rents, amounting to 11 l. 10 s.
making in whole about 27 l. 10 s.

   School.-The parish schoolmaster has an endowment of
5 l. 17 s. 8 d. Sterling, together with 10 bolls 3 firlots of
