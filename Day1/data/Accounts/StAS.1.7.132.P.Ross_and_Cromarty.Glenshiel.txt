Carolina with their families and many of their connections
which not only at the times but for some years after, very
sensibly diminished the number of inhabitants; and, by a
particular enumeration made in the year 1781, the number
of souls were 152 less than they are at present, being now
721.  The number of births is yearly from 17 to 22; of
marriages, from 3 to 6; and of burials, from 8 to 12.

   Battles.-In a narrow pass in the height of the parish was
fought in 1719 the battle of Glensheil, between some English
troops and 300 (some say 400) Spaniards.  These were joined
by some Highlanders who favoured the cause of the Pretender,
and who were headed by the Earl of Seaforth.  The Earl was
carried off by his tenants from the field, dangerously wound-
ed; and, soon after, his followers gave way, leaving the
English masters of the field of battle.  Their victory, how-
ever, cost them pretty dear, having lost their commander.
The Spaniards, who were suspected by the Highlanders of
not being hearty in the cause, surrendered prisoner at dis-
cretion.
