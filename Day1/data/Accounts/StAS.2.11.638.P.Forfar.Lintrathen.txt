  Wood.-Except on the banks of the rivers, there is no natural
wood. Within the last thirty years, pl`ntations have been laid
out to the extent of 1200 acres. These consist principally of
larch and Scots fir; oak, ash, beech, and plane trees have also
been planted in considerable numbers. There has hitherto been
little ornamental planting, and, except on two farms, there are no
trees along the sides of the fields.

                           II.-CIVIL HISTORY
  Parochial Registers.-The session records commence in 1664.
They do not appear at all times to have been kept with much
accuracy.
  Land-owners.-The land-owners are, the Erl of Airlie; Mr
Lyell of Kinnordy; Mr Smyth of Balhary; and Mr Ogilvy of
Ruthven.  The valued rent, L. 1628, 13s. 4d.. The real rent
is between L. 3000 and L. 4000, and has hitherto been well
paid.
  Eminent Men.-The only individual of any note that ever was
connected with the parish was Sir Allan Durward, who made a
conspicuous figure in the reign of Alexander III. The greater
part of the parish appears to have belonged to him. His castle is
now entirely demolished, but the moat that surrounded it is partly
visible. Vestiges of the wall which once lined his deer-park may
also be noticed.

           Amount of population in 1821              941
                                   1831              998
                                   1841              981

   The decrease in the population since 1831 is, in a great mea-
sure, to be ascribed to the discontinuance of improvements in agri-
culture, and to the ruinous condition of the houses of the pea-
santry. Emigration has not prevailed to any extent.
