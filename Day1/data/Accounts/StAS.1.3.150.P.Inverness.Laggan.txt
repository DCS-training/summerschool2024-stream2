its value.  A farm which, about 12 years ago, paid only L. 30
rent to the Commissioners of the Annexed Estates, has
been since let by the holder of it to an Airshire shepherd
at L. 190, and it is still thought a good bargain.  The Duke
of Gordon has not as yet shown any great disposion to let
his lands to shepherds; that nobleman is attached to his
people, and fond of nourishing and rearing them.

   Church, Stipend, Patron, etc.-In the year 1785, there
was a commondious church built, in the center of parish,
at a very considerable expence.  The glebe at present lets
at near L. 12 Sterling. The Duke of Gordon is patron of the 
parish.  The minister lives near the church, upon a com-
modious farm; and the heritors allow him L. 20 Sterling,
in lieu of manse, till one is built.  The money stipend is 
L. 70 Sterling.

   Schools.-In the middle of the parish stands the parochial
school, and schoolmaster's house, under one roof, both suffi-
ciently commodious.  The heritors allow the schoolmaster
1500 merks of salary.  The number of scholars attending
this school are 50 to 80, and somtimes more.  In the 
western parts of the parish are two Society schools; one upon
the Duke of Gordon's estate, and the other upon the estate
of Cluny.

   Servants and Labourers.-Our business is managed and car-
ried on chiefly by house-servants. There are a few who may
have one, sometimes two, of their servants without the fa-
mily; but this never happens unless the servant is a married
man, wtih a family.  He receives from his master a hut to
live in; grass for a cow; ground to fow a boll or two of
corn; and a small spot for planting 3 or 4 pecks of potatoes;
