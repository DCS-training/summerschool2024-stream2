     of Holme.

from N. to S.  A promontory, named Howqouy Head,
forms the entrance to the found on the west.  Another
promontory, called Roseness, limits its departure into the
east sea.  In the middle of the found, nearest the west en-
try, there is an island almost circular, termed Lambholme,
about 3 miles in cicumference, belonging to the parish, in
which there is one farm, ehich forms a pretty secure an-
chorage, between and the Main Land, for ships of 200 tons
burden, and a small pier, where vessels of 50 tons may lie
alongside; it is named Holme Sound Fay.  Through this
part of the sound, the post between Kirkwall and Edin-
burgh crosses, to the distance of about half a league.  The
shores in general are low and rocky, yielding to the pro-
prietors, communibus annis, 50 tons of kelp, besides a very
considerable quantity of sea-ware for manure.  The interjacent
space, betwixt the  four adjoining parishes and this, is an
undivided common, separated from the arable ground by
an earthen dike.  This common is covered with heath and
moss, from which the inhabitants of these surrounding pa-
rishes are supplied with peats and turf, their only fuel.  It
abounds with moorfowl, ducks, teals, snipes, green and
grey plovers.

   Soil.-The soil in this parish is, in general, light, thin, and
loamy, intermixed with small stones, but apparently com-
posed of the remains of the original moss, with which it
seems to have been formerly covered; and the unctuous
and tilly bottom, which, by long culture and manure,
mixed with ware, has fertilised it to that degree, as to pro-
duce, in ordinary seasons, more than sufficient for the de-
mand of the inhabitants.

   Produce.-The vegetable productions are big, (a small
species of barley), of which meal and malt are made, and
