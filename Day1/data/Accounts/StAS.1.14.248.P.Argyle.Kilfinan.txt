vessel of almost any burden may ride safe enough at an-
chor from any wind that blows.  There is pretty good
anchorage also at the ferry of Otter, already mentioned,
although not so well sheltered as the Kyles of Bute.

   Ferries.-There are 3 ferries; one, already mention-
ed, at Otter, near the N. end of the parish, across Loch-
fine to the parish of Kilmichael, in the district of Argyll.
At this ferry, the loch is supposed to be near a league
broad, and the fare is 3 d. Sterling each man; 9 d. each
horse.  It is badly attended on either side as to hands and 
boats; and at the inns very ordinary accommodation is to
be had, when the traveller happens to be storm-staid.  This
is very surprising, and much to be regretted, as it is
very much frequented, being on the very public line of 
road from all that part of Argyllshire lying on the N.
W. side of Lochfine, to Cowal, Greenock, Port-Glasgow,
and all the adjacent parts of the Low Country.  The 
other 2 ferries, are one from Bute to this parish, across the 
Kyles, and the other from this parish across Lochfine on
the line of road from Rothsay, in Bute, to Tarbert, a
village on the W. of Lochfine, about half way from In-
verary to Campbleton.  This line is not near so pub-
blick as that through the N. end of the parish; and the 
state of the ferries is much the fame, only the houses
are rather worse.

   Church, Stipend, &c.-The church was repaired, or al-
most rebuilt in the year 1759, and is now little more than
half-seated; but had it been entirely and properly finish-
ed within, it would only accommodate two-thirds of the
congregation, even in summer, when they come out in 
the greatest numbers.  In winter there is room enough,
