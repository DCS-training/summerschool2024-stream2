   Antiquities, Echo, etc.-There is a Druidical temple near
the old ruinon, castle of Balquhain.  From this castle there
is one of the finest echos in Scotland.  There is a large stone,
about half a mile W. from the church, which is about 10 feet
high above ground, 4 feet broad, and a foot thick; it is called
the Maiden Stone.  There are several curious hierogryphical
figures cut upon it, which are described in Pennant's Tour,
and an elegant plate of them given.  The bloody battle, of
Harlaw* was sought in this parish.
