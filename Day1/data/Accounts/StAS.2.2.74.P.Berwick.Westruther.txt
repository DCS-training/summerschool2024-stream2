   Modern Buildings.-The only modern mansion is the new house
now in the course of being built at Spottiswoode. It is in the old
English style. The public rooms are of the most splendid deserip-
tion. It is surrounded by a very handsome terrace, 300 feet in
length, ornamented by handsome balustrades pedestals, and vases.
The corridor is lighted by a well-proportioned tower in the centre
of the building. The tower itself has a very striking effect when
viewed from a distance overtopping the tall trees. The new house
is connected with the old family mansion, which has undergone
very important alterations, so that the whole will have a unique
appearance. It is not yet completed, but was fitted up in a tem-
porary, but very elegant style on a late auspicious occasion,-the
marriage of Mr Spottiswoode's second daughter to Sir Hugh Camp-
bell of Marchmont, M. P. for Berwickshire.
   The mansion-house at Bassendean, an old and plain building,
has been recently repaired and modernized in a handsome style,
and the adjacent grounds very tastefully laid out.
   The mansion-house at Wedderlie is an antique building, which

"Adieu! Adieu! my darling son,                An aged Saxon came to view
 I fear that ye be lost-                       The body of his chief,
For yester night my troubled mind             His streaming eyes, and downcast looks,
 With fearful dreams was tossed.               Bespoke a heart of grief

"I dreamed your mother's parted shade         "He's dead," he cried, "the bravest youth
 Between two armies stood;                     Ere sprang from Edgar's line,
A lonely youth on every band                  I bore him from the Scottish coasts
 With bosoms streaming blood.                  And made him pass for mine.

"My heart will break if you should fall,      "And in the days of youthful prime
 My only prop and stay,-                       He was my pride and boast,
Your brother, when in infant years,           For oft to bravery he has
 The Saxons bore away."                        Led on the Saxon host,"

"Delay it not," young Edgar said,             Old Edgar heard the Saxon's moan,
 "But let the trumpets blow,                   His cheeks grew deadly pale;
You soon shall see me prove your son,         A great convulsion shook his frame,
 And lay yon boaster low,"                     His nerves began to fail.

The trumpets, raised with deafening clang,    Frantic, he tore his aged locks
 The fearful onset blew,                       With time and trouble gray;
And then the chieftains stepped forth,        And faintly crying, my son! my son!
 Their shining swords they drew.               His spirit fled away.

Like lions in a furious fight,                The Scottish chief, as his father fell,
 Their steeled faulchions gleam,               He raised his fading eye,
Till from our Scottish warrior's side         And tore the bandage of his wounds
 Fast flowed a crimson stream.                 To let life's streams run dry.

With deafening din on the coats of mail       He kissed his sire, and his brother's wouds,
 The deadly blows resound,-                    That ghastly were and deep,
At last the Saxon warrior,                    And closed him in his folding arms,
 Did breathless press the ground.              And fell on his long, long sleep.
