     of Aberdeen.

   Bishop William Elphingston left a considerable legacy to
build a bridge over the river Dee, near Aberdeen, as well
as for the erection of an university at Old Aberdeen, where
the bishop's cathedral stood, but died in 1514, before any
thing was done in the building of the bridge.  Gavin Dun-
bar, son of Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, by Elizabeth
daughter of the Earl of Sutherland, and uncle to Gavin
Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow, having succeeded to the
bishoprick of Aberdeen in 1518, he soon thereafter caused

where it now stands, of seven arches, about the year 1530,
although it was not finished till after his death.  This
bridge having gone into decay about the year 1720, was
rebuilt out of the funds belonging to itself by the Magi-

and is, at this day, one of the neatest of any in Scotland.

and St Nicholas is about six miles, and is commonly known
by the name of the Bay of Aberdeen.  The shore is flat
and sandy.  The harbour at the mouth of the river Dee
was, till of late, always very much interrupted, and some-
times almost entirely shut up by a bar, or large bank of
sand, upon which, at low tide, there was sometimes not
above 18 inches or two feet of water, and at the highest
tides not more than 13 feet.  As this bar was frequently
shifting its situation and varying its form, according as it
was acted upon by storms from the sea, or floods from the
river, few shipping were in safety to take the harbour, un-
til first it was founded by a pilot, and the situation of the
