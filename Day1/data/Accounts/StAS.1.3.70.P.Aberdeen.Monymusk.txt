which appears now above ground, is about seven feet high;
and the only conjecture about the use of it, is, that it had
been set up to mark the boundary of the priory lands, on
that side where it was found.

   Floods.-All the low grounds which ly along the banks of
the river, must in some degree be liable to inundations or
land floods, though it is surprising how little mischief hap-
pens from them, considering how large a tract of land lies
seemingly exposed to their devastations.  The greatest da-
mage occasioned by events of this nature, was in the middle

cut, and in shocks; all the plains along the river suffered
extremely, the corns were swept almost clean away, and
many farmers were ruined.

and pierced and tore to pieces all the turnip, potatoes, etc.
It was so far happy for this parish, that two or three farms only,
in the east quarter of it, were exposed to its violence.  The
hail lay above a foot deep in many places, and notwithstanding
