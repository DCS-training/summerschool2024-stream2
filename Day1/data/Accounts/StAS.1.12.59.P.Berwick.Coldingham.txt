     Of Coldingham.

   The only camp that now appears to have been in this pa-
rish, is that upon the height called Warlaw, on the westward
of Auchencraw.  It is of an oval form, and contains 5 or 6
acres of very poor moor land; but history and tradition are si-
lent about it.

   Roads, etc.-Previous to the year 1772, the roads in this
county were repaired by the statute-work in kind, but which
was much neglected; and what part thereof that was performed,
was always done in the most slovenly and injudicious manner.
By that time several inclosures were made by our improvers,
upon the sides of the highways.  Necessity is the strongest
prompter; and the gentlemen being sensible of the continual
trespasses that must happen to their sences, unless the roads
were made passable, they applied for, and obtained an act of
parliament for making turnpike roads, and for converting the
statute-labour into money.  No turnpikes were ever erected
in consequence of that law, in this parish; but the statute-
work, so converted, was rigorously exacted, and applied un-
der the direction of the district meeting.  The amount of
these conversions in this parish, since 1772, may be about
3000 L. Sterling.  The great post-road leading across the com-
mon moor, naturally rough, wet, and deep, swallowed up a
great part of these conversions for many years, and a new se-
parate turnpike act was thought necessary, for completing
and upholding the repairs of that great road from Dunglass-
bridge to Berwick bounds, which was accordingly obtained;
and at same time a fine new bridge was built over the Pease
water, and that whole great post-road is now completely re-
paired.  Hence this part of the post-road, through Berwick-
shire, which was formerly the worst and most dangerous part
of it, between Edinburgh and London, is now in perfect
good repair; and the increase of travellers, especially in car-
