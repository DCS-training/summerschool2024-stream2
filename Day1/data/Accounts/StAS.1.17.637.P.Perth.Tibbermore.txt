sures appears to be attended with less inconvenience, because
there is very little of the land in the state of pasturage; but
perhaps the want of sufficient inclosures is one great reason
why the pasture fields are so few; for wherever there is in-
closed ground in the neighbourhood, the proprietor finds it

   The valued rent of the parish is 4921 L. Scotch money*;
the real rent, about 3200 L. Sterling.  The average rent of
the Scotch acre is about 15 s. Sterling.

   Manufactures.-To the enterprise and industry of very
early times+, we are indebted for a large canal or water-
lead, drawn from the river Almond, which intersects an ex-
tensive meadow, called Ruthven or Huntingtower-haugh, in
the east end of the parish; and the peculiar advantage which
this affords for manufacturing establishments, has been very
industriously improved within these late years.  One of the
first manufactures attempted here was that of paper; and at
the mill erected for this purpose, Morison and Lindsay of
Perth at present keep two vats employed in the manufacture
chiefly of the coarser articles, such as cartridge, blue, and
other packing papers; the quantity manufactured in one
year is from 5000 to 6000 reams, and the number of persons
employed in the work from 25 to 30.  The canal, however,
and the adjacent grounds, offered more distinguished advan-

*In the cess-books of the county, the valued rent of this
parish is stated somewhat higher, because some lands, which are
now considered as belonging to another parish, are there includ-
ed in the calculation.
