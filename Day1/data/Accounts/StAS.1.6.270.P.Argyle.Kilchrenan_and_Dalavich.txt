house, with stables and boats at the ferry of Portsonachan,
upon the shortest road to Bunaw and Oban.  This road runs
along the water of Naint through the romantic forest of Muck-
airn.-The roads of this district are very bad, the statute la-
bour having been suffered to be expended on lines of road
thought more immediately necessary, out of the parish, for ma-
ny years.-At the south end of the parish, Mr Campbell of Kil-
martin and Mr Campbell of Inverliver, have advanced consi-
derably in carrying on the line of road along the west side of
Lochow, as Mr Campbell of Sonachan has done on the east
side.

sists of 4 chalders of meal, and L. 400 Scotch, besides L. 60
Scotch for furnishing communion elements.  There are nei-
ther glebe nor manse *.-There are 2 new churches, in the pa-
rish, at 7 miles distance from each other.
   In 1764, the number upon the poor's list was 19; and the
only fund for their support, arising from the ordinary collec-
tions at the churches, amounted to L.3 : 18 : 81/4 sterling.  The
capital stock is now L. 64 : 11 : 5.  The interest of this sum,
with the ordinary church collections, amounted in 1791 to
L. 15 : 14 : 10, which was distributed amongst 29 persons, the
number now upon the list.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As no church lands could be found in the parish, the presbytery designed
a legal glebe, out of the nearest and most contiguous lands to the church as
law directs; which, alter being insested in, (in the year 1747), and obtaining
a horning upon the decreet of presbytery, the incumbent has been most unac-
countably kept out of possesion of this day; so that, if his noble patron
had-not provided him with a commodious farm, his situation must have been
most uncomfortable.
