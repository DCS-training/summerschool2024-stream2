subject. From calculations made by the late Dr Slall, it would
appear that the population in 1651 was about 8047. From that
time it rapidly decreased, in consequence, no doubt, of many leav-
ing the town from the horrors of the massacre, and the uncertainty
and troubles which followed the siege; so that in 1746 the inha-
bitants are said to have been only 5302. After that period a-
rapid increase must have taken place; for, from actual enumera-
tions, we know that

<TABLE>
		 In 1766 the population was 12,426
		    1781                    15,700
                    1788                    19,329

The state of the population subsequently, as taken from the go-
vernment census, is as follows:

         	 In 1801                    26,804
		    1811                    29,616
             	    1821                    30,575
                    1831                    45,355

In this last return there are of males 20,910, and of females
24,445.
	The account of 1831 is exclusive of seafaring persons, who can-
not be estimated at less than 2500. The cause of the extraordi-
nary increase in population since 1821, is to be ascribed, perhaps,
chiefly to the great advancement in the linen trade, which has pro-
duced so many spinning-mills, and led to the extension of the har-
bour; and which, by giving employment to thousands, has encou-
raged early marriages, as well as brought families from other parts
of Scotland and from Ireland.
	The number of inhabitants in the town and suburbs is 44,200,
in villages connected with the parish 800, and in the country 335.
The yearly average for seven years preceding 1831 of

	       Births and baptisms is        818
	       Marriages,                    393
	       Burials,                      923

At the same time, in regard to the accuracy of this list, it must be
stated, that some burials take place in St Andrew's Chapel ground,
where no register is kept; and several families of seceders and
others do not, from principle or otherwise, always enrol their child-
ren's names in the parish record.
	The number of families in the parish is 10,682; whereof 226 are
