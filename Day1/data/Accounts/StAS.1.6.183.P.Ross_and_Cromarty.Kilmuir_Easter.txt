     PARISH OF KILMUIR EASTER.

     (PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS.)

   THE Celtic, and original name of this parish, is Cilmoir

the synod of Ross, which, in consequence of an annexation
which lately took place, has lost its antient name of Kil-
muir Wester, and is now known by the appellation of Knock-
bain.
   The parish lies partly in the country of Ross, and partly in
the country of Cromarty.  This is the situation of all the pa-

lege of costituting his whole landed property in Scotland into
a separate country, called the country of Cromarty; and his
property being of considerable extent, and in detached por-
