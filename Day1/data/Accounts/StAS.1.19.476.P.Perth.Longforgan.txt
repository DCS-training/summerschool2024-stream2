paired, perhaps enlarged, and its name changed, by the Lord
Gray, who obtained the charter from James II*.

<FOOTNOTE>

The most ancient part of this castle had been an oblong square, built
upon the most projecting part of the rock, in such fashion, that the first set
of apartments, consisting of three vaults, all arched with strong masonry,
had one end solid rock, and the other a wall of 14 feet thick, with a win-
dow to each, about 6 inches wide and 4 feet high.  In the middle vault
there had been a well, which is now filled up.
Opposite to the southermost vault, the rock projects little farther to the
westward, and is lower than the rest, upon which the pit of prison was
built; also 14 feet thick walls, and a narrow slit of a window; no passage
to the pit but by a trap-door, and over it, a square apartment of 20 feet
high, arched at top, with a window of 4 feet square, and 38 feet from the
ground, which is supposed to have been the guard-room, the only door of
which is arched; and there was not the least vestige of any other way to
get access to the castle, even for one man at a time, but over the shelving
rock on the south-west, and close by the two windows in the other two
arched apartments, one of which is exactly upon the door, calculated, as it
would appear, for the use of spears, or other offensive weapons, to prevent
the entrance of an enemy.  From all which, it would appear to have been
as secure a retreat, in those days, as nature and art could make it.  This
door had been built up, probably when Earl Patrick repaired the castle,
and another, on the north-east side, had been struck out at that time, to
make the access more convenient.  On opening that old door in 1777, a very
large iron-gate was found inclosed in a 10 feet wall, built of solid masonry.
To make the castle still more secure, it appears, that the original builders
had left no other way of getting to the apartments above, after passing the
shelving rock, close by the two narrow windows of the lower vaults, but
through the guard-room; and then, by a hole of about 3 feet square in the
top of one of the arches, to which they must mount by a ladder, which,
though built up, is perfectly distruct at this day.  It is probable, that after
mounting, the ladder was drawn up, and the Lord of the castle slept in se-
curity.
   It would also appear, that some time or other there had been some kind
of excavations round part of the castle, probably to serve as a ditch for de-
fence; for, in 1780, when sinking a foundation for some addition to the
present building, for about 12 feet deep and upwards, it appeared to have
been filled up with wood-ashes, and rubbish of various materials; so that
