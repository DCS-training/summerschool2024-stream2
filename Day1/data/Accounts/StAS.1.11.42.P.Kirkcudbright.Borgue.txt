and the rents trisling, yet the inhabitants appear to have en-
joyed the comforts of life in a very inconsiderable degree.

   Present State.-The rents of land at present are increased in
the proportion of 4 or even 6 to 1.  The quantity of stock is
greatly diminished.  Many of the farmers, notwithstanding, have
attained to opulence; all of them are independent, and enjoy the
comforts, and many of the pleasures of life, in no inconsider-
able degree.  The disadvantages, under which they labour, are
comparatively few; and they enjoy advantages more than
sufficient to make ample compensation.  Besides the advan-
tages of soil and climate already mentioned, we apprehend it
may be added, that their farms, in general, are of a proper
extent; that they are at a proper distance from market
towns; that they need few articles of importation, and have
a ready sale and easy conveyance for articles of exportation;
and that there are no villages, or small manufacturing towns in
the parish.  The last of these, we are aware, is usually classed
under the opposite head.  The politician, doubtless, ought to
consider the want of villages and manufactures as an evil,
because it is unfriendly to population, and increase of national
revenue; but the philosopher, with more enlarged and better
sentiments, forbears to lament the loss, when he considers
their pernicious influence on the morals, health and happiness
of mankind.  It cannot escape the notice of the attentive ob-
server, that, in villages, the most worthless and wretched part
of society is commonly to be found. Thither the dregs of the
community, from all quarters, are poured in.  Every incentive
to vice is presented, and no proper police is established to give
a check to the growing evil.  Where villages are founded,
manufactures ought indeed invariably to be established, as the
best means to give encouragement to industry; which will
opperate as a more effectual check to the progress of vice, and
