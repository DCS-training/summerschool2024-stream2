particularly 2 large head-stones, with 7 or 8 small ones,
standing in a right line at the head of so many parallel
graves, which are said to contain the ashes of the parents
and their children.  At or near this cemetery, there has
probably been a chapel or place of worship; but all tradi-
tion concerning it is lost.
   We have no uncommon migratory birds; and it is
doubtful, whether all birds, usually reckoned of this class,
do really belong to it.  The ground of this doubt well
appears, from the following observations respecting the
swallow: Owing to a hint given me by a neighbour, I
have been, for some seasons, pretty attentive to the first
appearance of this bird; but not accurate enough to mark
the dates, till last spring, when, on the 2d of May 1793,
I saw them, for the first time, pretty early in the morning,
in considerable numbers on the loch (about 18 yards from
the bottom of the garden), from which they seemed to
be just then in the process of emerging; though, as there
was some rippling on the water, it was difficult to discern
the breaking of the surface; but the observer is positive,

have lodged or lain somehow at the bottom, since the time
of their disappearing last year.  The weather, all day, con-

and disappeared within observation.  With anxious ex-

through, but no appearance of them, nor for several days
following; and, therefore, there can be no doubt of their
