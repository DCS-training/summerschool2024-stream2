of L. 2 per acre, allowing 200 acres for roads, rivulets, &c. comes

which, at L. 3 per family, amounts to L. 1200; in whole to L. 5920
Sterling.
	It appears from the Government official tables laid before Par-
liament on 19th October 1831, that the annual value of the real
property in the parish of Rutherglen as assessed in April 1815 is
L. 9771 Sterling, viz. in the burgh L. 5263, parish L. 4508.
	Public-Houses.--There are 1108 families in the burgh, and 46
houses in it licensed to sell spirituous liquors. In the landward
part of the parish there are 130 families and 3 public-houses.
	Irregular Marriages.--In former times, too great facilities were
given to irregular marriages by the magistrates of Rutherglen, who
frequently received a fee for their trouble, and even at this day a
Rutherglen marriage is too easily obtained. The form is simple.
The couple go before a magistrate, and acknowledge that they
have been married without the proclamation of banns by a person
unauthorized by the church whose name they do not recollect; and,
in consequence of this irregularity, they acknowledge a fault, and
subject themselves to fine and imprisonment; on which the magis-
trate fines the parties, remits the imprisonment, and gives an extract
of their acknowledged marriage, which is binding in law.
	Benefit Societies.--There are five benefit and two funeral socie-
ties in the parish. Besides weekly aliment paid to sick members,
the friends receive 20s. for funeral expenses. The members of one
of the funeral societies pay 1s. 8d. at entry, and 6d. in the month,
and for this the family receives L. 3, 5s. for the funeral of a member
or his wife, and a proportional sum for their children. The other
is a collier society; the entry money is 2s. 6d. and 9d. in the month.
The colliers dissolve their society at the end of every year and begin
again. These societies are of great use, they tend to keep up a spi-
rit of independence among the working-classes, and relieve the poors'
fund. From 1810 to 1820, the Rutherglen benefit societies paid
L. 1120 in aliment to their members, besides L. 240 for funeral
expenses. These societies contributed L. 40 from their funds to
the relief of cholera cases from 20th February to l0th May 1832.
	Fairs.--The best frequented, and probably the most ancient,
of all the fairs in Rutherglen is the one called St Luke's. It be-
gins on the third Monday of October, and used to continue the
whole week,
