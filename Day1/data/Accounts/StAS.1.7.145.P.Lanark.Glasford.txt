fice is 30 L 8 s. 10 d. in money, 74 bolls 14 pecks in oat-
meal, a manse, and a glebe of near six acres.  The Earl of
Eglintoune is patron.  The present rent of his Lordship's
property in the parish is 292 L out of which the clergyman
is paid 1 L 5 s. 3 d. in money, and 36 pecks in victual.
Another heritor, whose rent is scarcely 6 L pays 5 s. in mo-
ney, and 20 pecks in victual.  To them who understand the
doctrine of teinds, this disproportion, vast as it is, may not
seem extraordinary.  It serves, however, (a wag might say),

tors, 8 of whom do not reside in the parish.  The whole
valued rent is 2654 L 4 s. 2 d. Scots.  The real rent can-
not be less than 1900 L Sterling.

heritors, unlike the ancient Jews, love not to decorate the
temple; though it would be doing them injustice not to ob-
serve, that they love to attend it.
   Matters have been so managed here, that the manse is
like the church.  Though repaired five years ago, the manse
needs again to be repaired.  It is damp in the extreme.
After a thaw or a smart shower of rain, the inside walls and
timber exhibit a scene wonderfully striking.  The pearly
drops meet the eye from every point of view; so that, amid
he rigours of winter, its inhabitants enjoy some of the plea-
sures of a May morning.  The situation of the manse ac-
counts for this.  It lies in a swamp, the inconvenience of
which the present clergyman has, in some degree, remedied
y sivers, as they are here called, and by other methods of
