     Of Kirkmichael and Cullicudden.

   Stipend, Schools, Poor, etc.-Mrs. Urquhart of Brac-
langwell and Newhall is patroness of this united parish.
The kirk is neat and commodious.  The manse, lately
repaired, is very small, and very improperly situated
on swampy ground, below a brae.  The stipend amounts
to 29 L. 8 s. 10 d. Sterling in money, with 4 chalders of
barley, and 4 chalders of oat meal.  The glebe consist-
ed, at the incumbent's admission, of 19 acres of poor
moorish soil arable, and about 12 acres of barren stony
moor; he has since added 6 acres to thearable ground.-
As the bulk of the inhabitants reside towards the extre-
mities of the parish, the parochial school is taught in
the E. end, by a deserving young man, who has only
8 L. 6 s. 8 d. of stated salary; and a school for spinning,
knitting stockings, and reading English, is established by
the Honourable Society, in the wester end, with a salary
of 7 L.  It is to be hoped, that the period will soon ar-
rive, when the landed interest of Scotland will feel
themselves constrained, by the love of justice and their
country, to grant something like decent salaries to that
most useful class of men, the parochial teachers of
youth; who, after a liberal and expensive education,
devote their time and talents to the duties of an office,
which is not only most laborious and fatiguing in itself,
but of the utmost importance to the best interests of so-
ciety.-There never was an established fund for the poor
of this parish: And though the number of those who
received of the weekly collections amounted, till of late,
to from 60 to 70, the annual collections have seldom
exceeded 8 L., after paying the session-clerk's and kirk-
officers fees* .
