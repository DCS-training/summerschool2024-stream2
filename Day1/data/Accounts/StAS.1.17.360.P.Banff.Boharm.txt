     Statistical Account

   It may be mentioned, that it is supposed practicable to
build a stone-bridge here for about the sum of 3000 l. Ster-
ling, which, besides certain conveniencies peculiar to this
situation, would comprehend also all the requisite accommo-
dation to the public; for, if the high-way were continued
from where it joins the road between Keith and Fochabers,
at the south end of the last of these villages, in the shortest
course, to the Boat of Brigg, the distance from Cullen to El-
gin would not be increased above 5 English miles on the
whole, on a road as firm, and less exposed to depth of snow,
than the present high-way from Fochabers to Elgin.

   Population.-The ancient state of the population of the
parish cannot now be ascertained, farther than that it does
not appear that the number of farm-houses, or the extent of
arable land, has been any way materially altered from what
they were in times very remote.
   Of late years, the population has been rather on the de-
crease, owing to several smaller farms, on which from 2 to
6 families resided, being reduced into a single farm, and oc-
cupied by a single family.
   At present, the number of persons amounts to 1294, of
whom 588 are males, and 706 females.
   They all reside in the country, and follow the occupation
of husbandry, with the exception of the few craftsmen who
are requisite for that object, and for the more immediate ac-
commodation of the people.  There are none who have left
the parish for want of employment; yet a few go southward
in summer, on account of the higher wages given in that
part of the kingdom.
   There has never been any accurate register kept of bap-
tisms, marriages, or burials.  These particulars, therefore,
cannot with any satisfactory precision be ascertained.
