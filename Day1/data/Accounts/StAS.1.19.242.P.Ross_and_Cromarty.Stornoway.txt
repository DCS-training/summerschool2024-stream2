north, by Ness and the ocean; on the east, by the channel,
on the south, by the channel and the river Creed, which
divides it from the parish of Lochs.  It consists of three di-
stricts, namely, Stornoway, Ui, and Grefs.  At the head
of this triangle stands the well-known village of Stornoway,
whose origin is very old, and, like other towns, from a
small beginning, is now arrived to some distinction and uti-

near and opposite to the town, is built Seaforth Lodge, for
the reception and accommodation of Seaforth, the proprie-

of his estate, and where the present proprietor, Colonel
Francis Humberstone Mackenzie, a gentleman universally
known for benevolence and a public spirit, did reside for
some years with his family; who, with his lady, when here,
took pleasure in directing and superintending their people
to habits of industry and happiness, until he was called a-
way, at the commencement of the present war, to serve his
King and country, by raising two battalions of infantry for
Government.  This mansion is delightfully situated, and
commands an extensive view both of sea and land.
   Stornoway is furnished with an excellent and well-fre-

burden, annually listed for the bounty at a great expence,
and by he profits arising from them they are chiefly sup-
ported.  In some late years notwithstanding, their utmost
endeavors have been almost wholly frustrated by the fail-
ing of the fishing; of consequence, they must be great suf-
ferers by their adventures in this business, as the bounty
money will not defray their expense.  The house are built
