   Population.-As no regular register has been kept here for
many years past, no proper account can be given of the po-
pulation at different periods; only, in the year 1722, when
Forbes and Kearn were united, the number of examinable per-
sons in both was                                        300
And, in 1755, when the return was made to Dr. Web-
   ster, the number of souls was                        436
At present (1793), it amounts only to                  +370

   Manufactures.-The chief manufacture, carried on in this
and the neighbouring parishes, is knitting of stockings; in
which occupation most of the women, thoughout the whole
year, and some boys and old men, during the winter season,
are employed.  They receive for spinning, doubling, twisting
and weaving each pair, from 10 d. to 2 s. Sterling, according
to the fineness or coarseness of the materials, and the dimen-
sions of the stockings.  Some few women are employed in
spinning lint.
