in the Celtic.  The name of the town is, by some, supposed
a compound of Gothic or Celtic, with a Roman word,
Drumfriars; by others, it is considered as more entirely
Celtic, Drumfresh, a hill or rising ground, clad with furze
or scroggy bushes.  It is a curious circumstance, that the
Saxon names of places in this neighbourhood, seem to be
confined, in a great measure, to the east side of Lochermoss.
This might lead us to think, that the ancient Northumbrian
monarchy must have been bounded upon this side by that
extensive morals; did not Bede relate so distinctly, that it
comprehended Galloway, and even some part of Ayr-
shire; and were not various other Saxon, or at least
Gothic names to be met with, in advancing westward along
the coast of Galloway.

   Eminent Men.-Amongst the eminent men, that have be-
longed to Dumfries, may be mentioned Mr Alexander Cairn-
cross.  He was minister here in the last century, in the short
reign of Episcopacy, and was afterwards translated to the
fee of Brechin, of Glasgow, and of Raphoe in Ireland,
where he died, and where his memory is still respected.  A
Mr George Campbell, too, in the last century, after being
minister here, became Professor of Divinity in the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh.  The late Dr Ebenezer Gilchrist, who
died in 1774, was a man of considerable eminence in his
profession, and highly distinguished for general literature.  He
published An essay on the use of sea voyages in consumptive cases,
which was favourably received.  The late Commissary John
Goldie, who died in 1776, is allowed to have been one of
the most respectable inferior judges in Scotland.  The late
Andrew Crosbie, Esq; of Holm, advocate, and Dr William
Wight, late professor of divinity in Glasgow, both natives
of this place, well deserve to be enumerated among those
whole talents have done honour to their prosession.
