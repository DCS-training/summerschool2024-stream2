 ample territorial jurisdection was vested in the barons, and in towns
 in the magic trates.  From these an ultimate appeat was competent

 to the signers, and clerks of session.  The members are endowed
 with many privillage and were exempt from several of the city
 taxes.  The powers and jurisdiction of the Court of Session are
 so exthensive as not to be execeeded by those of any tribunal in a
