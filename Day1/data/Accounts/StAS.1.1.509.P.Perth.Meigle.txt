together without much art, and vitrified above, below, and
on both sides; so that the whole mass was firmly cemented.
That an opening was left below, after the process was finish-
ed, is doubtful.  On the upper part of the bridge a stratum
of gravel was laid, to render the passage smooth and easy.
This is the sole part of the sort intentionally vitrified.  A few
yards distant from the ditch, there is an outer wall, the foun-
dation of which is about 8 feet lower than the summit of the
mound.  The approach to the fort is from the N. E. along
the verge of precipice; and the entrance was secured by a
bulwark of stone, the ruins of which are extant.  There is
no vestige of a well within the fort;  but, westward, between
the basis of the mound and the precipice, there was a deep
pond or lake, recently filled up by the tenants in the neigh-
bourhood.  About a quarter of a mile eastward, on the de-
clivity of the hill, there are some remains of another oval
fort, of less extent than the preceding, consisting of a strong
wall and ditch.  Tradition says, that there was a subterra-
nean communication between these forts, which is not im-
probable.  From the account now given, it would appear.
1.  That both were constructed before the Romans introduced
the art of building with lime and other cement.  2.  That the
Picts, and antient Scots had stone edifices, which Macpher-
son is not inclined to admit.  3.  That they sometimes vitri-
fied particular parts of their forts, to render them the more
durable.

   There is no vestige of a Roman highway in the neighbour-
hood of Meigle, though traces of one have been discovered
in other parts of the country.  At Cupar are extant the out-
lines of a camp formed by Agricola's army in his seventh
year's expedition.  On the praetorium, Malcolm IV by the
advice of his grandfather, founded an abbey for the reception
