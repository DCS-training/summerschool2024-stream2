     No. 6.]  The Statistical Account.

Duke of Buccleugh's estate ten tenants; on the laird of Had-
den's four; on Sir George Douglas's estate two.  The intro-
troduction of turnips, which takes place in every farm in a
greater or less degree according to the dryness of the soil, has
contributed greatly to improve the soil, and to bring great
profit to the farmer; producing, when fed off by sheep, at a
mean price, L. 3 per acre, and afterwards fine crops of barley,
oats, and spring wheat.  It is not above twenty years since
this improvement has taken place.
   There is a very large common in England, called Wark Com-
mon, to which the farmer at Bedan, belonging to the Duke
of Roxburgh, all the tenants of Hadden, and all the tenants
of the Duke of Buccleugh, have a right to pasture sheep and
young cattle.  About sixty years ago, this right was disputed
by the tenants of the Earl of Tankerville and Sir Henry Grey
of Howick; they drove away to Wark the beasts belonging to
the Scotch farmers, who maintained their right by force, go-
ing in a body with their servants armed with clubs, and, after
broken heads on both sides, recovered their cattle, and sent
them to the common, where they have pastured unmolested
to this day.  I have converted with farmers who acted as
principals in this fray.  This common is very large, and com-
prehends in it several miles.  There are plain vestiges of its
having been cultivated with the plough; and very fit it is for
that purpose.
   There is at Lempetlaw, belonging to the Duke of Buc-
cleugh, the ruins of a place of worship, and a present burial
ground.  It is said that the religious of the abbey of Holy-
roodhouse had the direction of this chapel, and that the
Duke's property in the parish once belonged to the town of
Edinburgh; certain it is that the Duke pays yearly L. 34 ster-
ling to the town of Edinburgh, by whom I am paid one hun-
dred pound Scots of stipend.
