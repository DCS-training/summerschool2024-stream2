rous as before the village existed.  In other parts of the pa-
rish, the population is more simila to what it was 30 or 40
years ago.  The average of burials, from 1754 to 1761, is
about 11 1\2, which, if multiplied by 36, gives 414: perhaps
that register is not perfectly exact; but if we suppose
that it is, and that the preparation of burials, to the number
of inhabitants, is the same here as above, they were scarce the
half of their present number.  The population, at different
periods, and the proportion of marriages, births, and burials,
to the number of inhabitants in 1781 an 1791, may be ob-
served by inspecting the following tables:
