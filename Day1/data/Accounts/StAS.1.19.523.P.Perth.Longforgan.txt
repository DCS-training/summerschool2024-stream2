   Resident Proprietors Farmers.-All the resident proprie-
tors are farmers, which is realty of more consequence, both
to the country and to themselves, than is generally ima-
gined; for it is of consequence to the country to have pro-
prietors, who have both spirit to adopt and to try new ex-
periments, and money to carry them into execution.  If
useful and advantageous, they will be examples to their
tenants; if they fail, they can afford the loss.  But it is im-
possible to estimate the advantage to themselves; for it en-
ables them to judge of the exact extent a farm ought to be
of for a certain number of horses and men, and no more;
and will make him a competent judge of the value of his
farms, and prevent him from falling into that most injudi-
cious error, of increasing his rents beyond what the farms
can afford to pay.

   Remarkable Change of Property.-It is very remarkable,
that near 6-7ths of this parish has changed its proprietors
within less than 30 years.

1615 for 40,000 merks Scots, equal to L. 2222: 4: 5 5/12
Sterling; and in 1777, it sold again for L. 40,000 Sterling.
