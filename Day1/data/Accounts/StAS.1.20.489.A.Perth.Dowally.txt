   There is frequently a want of milk for the rearing of
calves in spring.  No substitute can be found so nutritive as
this natural food to the young animal, but any substitute
which will help to preserve the life of some who might
without it be lost, or which will save milk to the family,
when necessary for making butter or cheese, is valuable.
Hay tea, or a strong decoction of hay, answers this purpose
better than any other.  In spring 1796, the compiler of this
paper reared 10 calves; and in spring and summer 1797,
he reared 21, chiefly by the use if hay-tea, with such a pro-
portion of milk as could be spared from the produce of two
cows, (which were all he had, and from which his family
were suppplied, at the same time, with cream and butter.
To a calf of the largest Lothian breed, he generally began
by giving from 3 to 4 pints a day of milk, with as much
hay-tea as it was disposed to take.  This was continued for
8 days; for the next 8 days, the quantity of milk daily gi-
ven with the hay-tea, was reduced to 2 pints; and for a 
third space of 8 days, to 1 pint, after which it received
hay-tea only.  To a calf of the Highland breed, a smaller
proportion of both milk and hay-tea would be required.
For the hay-tea, the proportion of ingredients was 5 lb.
good hay to 6 pints of water.  These were boiled, (for
boiling is to be preferred to sleeping it), till the decoction
amounted to about 4 pints.
   As the Duke of Atholl, by his new arrangements, stipu-
lates that the sheep shall remain during winter in the hill,
it will be necessary to improve the present breed, or to in-
troduce a new one, stronger and more hardy.  Perhaps the
former is most advisable.  The present stock is habituated
to the climate and the pasture, and their size may be increa-
sed by a careful attention to select the best of them as
breeders.
