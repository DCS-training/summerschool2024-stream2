      400                             ARGYLESHIRE.

      in this parish, was well endowed and supported by the M'Do-
      n`lds; but the number of its officiating ministers, and the amount
      of its revenues, cannot now be ascertained.  Keith, in his Cata-
      logue of Bishops, mentions that, in the year 1261, Laurence,
      Bishop of Argyle, annexed this church to the Abbey of Paisley,
      with the consent undoubtedly of M'Donald.  The reasons of this
      annexation are unknown, as at that period there bad been recently
      erected a monastery at Saddell by the M'Donalds.
         Argyle having declared himself on the side of the Covenanters,
      in the General Assembly 1638, instantly set about raising an
      army for their defence.  The M'Donalds, the followers of Mon-
      trose, having swept Kintyre, giving many of the inhabitants to
      the sword, and their houses to the devouring flames, were in their
      turn checked, turned back, and, at Dunaverty, defeated by Leslie
      and Argyle.  So completely were the estates of Argyle wasted
      by the scourge of war, that a sum of money was voted by the
      Estates of Parliament for the support of himself and family, and
      a collection was ordered throughout all the churches of Scotland
      for the relief of his plundered people.
         Kintyre was left a desert; its few inhabitants became the prey
      of a fearful pestilence which followed in the train of all their other
      calamities.
         In this wilderness, where a smoking chimney was scarcely to
      be seen, the lowlanders, who had joined the standard of Argyle,
      were encouraged, after the war, to settle. Others came from
      the opposite mainland, and bringing with them their servants
      and dependents, a considerable part of this parish, which admitted
      of being cultivated and ploughed like Ayrshire, was speedily occu-
      pied by a thriving colony of pious and industrious inhabitants.
