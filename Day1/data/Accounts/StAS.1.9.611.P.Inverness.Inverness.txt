   Woods.-There are no natural woods in this parish, if we
except an inconsiderable oak-wood, which is periodically
cut for the bark.  But this defect is amply compensated
by the extensive plantations with which the parish abounds.
In the extremity of the parish eastward, on the estate of
Culloden, there is a plantation of Scotch firs and forest-
trees of considerable extent.  This plantation was com-
pleted above 70 years ago.  It is of great advantage to the
proprietor, and will undoubtedly be of still greater.  The
plantations on the estate of Kinmylies, in the western ex-
tremity of the parish, were begun about 35 years ago, and
completed in a few years.  On this estate every acre that
was not capable of being improved to arable land was plant-
ed.  Others followed this example.  One gentleman in
particular, who kept an exact account of his operations,
planted 15,000 forest-trees of the following kinds:  elm, ash,
beach, oak, and sycamore, and 4 millions of Scotch firs,
which occupy a space of 800 acres of Duncan, one of the
Drumalbin range of mountains.  In short, on the face of
this range to the east, and as far as the property of the
gentlemen in this parish extends to the west, with the ex-
ception of what was fit for arable land, and the oak-wood
formerly mentioned, from Lochness northward to the
Beauly frith, an extent of six miles in length, is covered
with thriving plantations.  Beside there, there are several
other plantations, and all in a thriving state.  This business
is still going on with little remission, so that in a few years
it is likely there will not be a single useless acre in this
parish.

   Agriculture, etc.-Wheat, barley, oats, and pease, are
sown in this parish.  The wheat from the middle of Oc-
tober till the end of November, the barley from the middle
