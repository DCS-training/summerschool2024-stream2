liquors, which were not only destructive to health, but pro-

make a fine apperance on his Majesty's birth-day; so many
handsome, genteel, well dressed young men, can hardly be

in the country: Perfect order, decorum, and loyalty, are
manifest in every expression, motion and countenance, du-
ring the whole procession and festivity.-Notwithstanding
the confusions and disorders we hear of in other parts of the
country, it must afford high pleasure to all lovers of order
and of their country, to observe the inhabitants of this
parish in general, sensible of the unparalleled happiness we
enjoy as members of a community, under the protection of
the wife laws of our most excellent constitution, and the
mild administration of our most gracious Sovereign, dwelling
in peace and safety, in full and secure possession of liberty
and property, with none to make us afraid; while we con-

under the direction of Divine inspiration) to fear God, to
honour the King, and not to meddle with them that are gi-
ven to change.
