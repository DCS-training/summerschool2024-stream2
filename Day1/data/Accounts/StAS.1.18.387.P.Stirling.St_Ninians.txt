parish is irregular, its extent may be computed, at a medi-
um, about 10 miles from east to west, and about 6 miles from
north to south.

   The appearance of the Parish ancient and modern.-The pa-
rish is naturally divided into three regions.  The most nor-
therly division is called the Carses.  The carses are flat lands
lying along the banks of the Forth, from the east to the west
end of the parish: these lands, in a plain but a little raised a-
bove the level of the Forth, extend southward from one to
two or three miles.
   The dryfield lands form the middle division.  These rise
suddenly and considerably above the level of the carses, and
occupy by much the most extensive part of the parish.  The
muirlands form the highest region and the most southerly di-
vision.  They rise considerably above the level of the dryfield
grounds, and occupy, it is supposed, somewhat more than a
fourth part of the whole extent of the parish.
   It is highly probable, that not only a great part of the dry-
field lands, but that a great part of the muirlands also was
originally covered with wood.  The royal forest of Dun-
daff must have covered the high lands, which are still cal-
led by the name of the lands of Dundaff.  The royal
forest of Stirling must have covered the rising grounds to
the south of that town.  An extensive moss renders it pro-
bable, that even the low lands of the parish, especially to the
north east, were once covered with trees.  There can be
no doubt, that at an early period, the Torwood occupied
much of the lands of the parish to the east and to the south
east.
   The limits of the carse and dryfield lands, still assume the
general appearance of the banks of a river, and give plausibi-
lity to an opinion, that the carse lands were originally covered
