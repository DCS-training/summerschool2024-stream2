Forrester was Reader at Haillis, "his stipend xiiili. xs. and 9d. to-
gidder with the vicarage pensionarie of Haillis, to be payit out of
the thrid of the Hospitale of Sanstanthonis in Leith."
   From records of the Kirk of Scotland 1639, we find that Wil-
liam Ogstane, minister at Colingtoune, had been deposed in 1638,
for deserting of his flock, causing his people after a superstitious
way to sit on their knees when he examined them, meddling with
the poor folk's box, &c. and that his case was in 1639 referred to
the Commission that was to be appointed.
   The parochial registers are contained in seven volumes, which are
all in good condition. These volumes contain the proceedings of the
kirk-session, the distributions made to the poor, and the minutes of
the heritors, of which last there are very few; but since 1716, the
poor's matters have been separately recorded, and since 1757,
the minutes of the heritor's meetings. The registers of marriages,
baptisms, and burials, have always been kept in separate volumes.
The first minute of session wants the date, but it menfions the re-
turn of the minister from Fife, whither he had fled about a year
before, in consequence of Cromwell's victory at Dunbar, 3d Sep-
tember 1650, and the next minute is 14th September 1651.
These records are minutely kept until July 1733, between which
date and 1746, the payments made to the poor only are recorded.
From that period till 1783, matters of discipline are again intro-
duced; but thereafter, until 1823, very few 6htries appear on the
record. From these books it appears that since 1650, the thir-
teenth minister is now in possession of the cure of Colinton.  1.

minister in 1651, returned the schoolmaster, and since that period
the sixteenth  schoolmaster is at present in possession of the charge.
Of the first, John Craw, it is stated that he was deposed in 1655
for brewing and selling drind in the school-house, "so near the
kirk and minister's yett."  From these records we learn that there
