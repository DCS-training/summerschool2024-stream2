     Statistical Account

The population of both islands has increased nearly one sixth
within these 40 years.  By a lift made out in January 1792,
the number of fouls was found to be 614, which is exactly
100 more, than the return to Dr. Webster in 1755.  Of this
increase, nearly one half has taken place within the last 5
years, as by an enumeration taken in 1787, the number was
572, which makes an increase of 42, or above 8 per annum
within that period.  The following tables will exhibit a view
of the different sexes, ages, conditions and professions of the
people in both islands.
