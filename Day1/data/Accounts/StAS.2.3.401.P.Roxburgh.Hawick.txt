Farmer's Club.-A farmer's club was established in this town in
1776, which has contributed in no small degree to the furtherance
of the agricultural interests of the district.  The following extract,
from a very interesting report drawn up by the secretary, James
Grieve, Esq. Branxholm Braes, will serve at once to explain the
object of its institution, and to point out the benefits which have
resulted from its proceedings:-
     "The object of the institution is the improvement of farming,
and in furtherance of this object the members have given a varie-
ty of premiums, recommended the institution and regulation of
markets, and have been in the habit of discussing questions con-
nected with agriculture, stock-farming, and rural polity in general.
   The club meets on the first Thursday of every month, when the
members dine together, the chair being taken by each member in
rotation.  A subject has been generally given out one club-day
for discussion on the next, and some very interesting questions ap-
pear in the records of the society.

market in Hawick, for in November that year, the club issued an
advertisement of the following tenor:-Several farmers in the
neighbourhood of Hawick, being desirous of establishing the prac-                                          Pi"
