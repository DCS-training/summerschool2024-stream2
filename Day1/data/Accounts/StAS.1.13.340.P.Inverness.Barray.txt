boat to Dunveggan, and then through Sky, the distance 
is much greater, and the expenses more considerable.-
The number of poor is generally from 40 to 50; there
are L. 400 Sterling of a fund for them, L. 200 of which 
is a mortification by Archibald Macneil, late tacks-
man of Sanderay, and L. 100 by Roderick Shaw, tacksman 
of Alasdale, now living; they never go any where else to
collect their subsistence.

   Servants, Wages, etc.-The number of servants depends

that must keep such a number of servants, must also keep 
16 or 18 horses, both which are almost wholly employed 
drying and carrying home their peats, from the beginning 
of June, when the sowing is at an end, till the latter end 
of August, when the reaping comes on.  If the Legisla-
