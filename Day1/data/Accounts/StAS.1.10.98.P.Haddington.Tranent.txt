proprietors differ as to the mode of raising it, and there the
matter at present rests.

   The near vicinity of the coal has likewise its disadvantages.
The poorer classes of the community are attracted to the

several of the modern houses in the county have lately been
built.  There was, within there few years, a chalybeate
