   Agriculture, etc.-There are 5 principal farmers, who
prosses from 200 to 360 acres each, which they labour with
a plough for about every 40 acres;  there are 10 other far-
mers, who posses from 30 to 60 acres eack, which they
labour usually with one plough; and, in general, their fa-
milies consist of a man for every plough, a boy or 2 to
take care of their cattle, and 2 or 3 maid-servants.  They
have beside as many hands as are necessary to thresh out
their corns, who are generally their cottagers, and are em-

generally one part of their land, about a 6th, in sallow, an-

in clover and rye-grass, and another in oats.  But this pro-
portion is sometimes varied, commonly for the sake of ha-
ving a greater quantity od wheat, which, besides being
sown constantly after the fallow, is sown also sometimes af-
ter pease and sometimes after grass.  As the principal far-
mers labour in a very superior style, and raised as much out
of their ground as is done perhaps any where in the island,
the parish does much more than supply itself with provi-

are annually exported, but chiefly of what and barley.
About 10 acres may be sown in flax, which they raise for
their own use, and about as many in potatoes and turnips.
They have not much in pasture, as they feed their horses
with grass in the house, and send their young cattle to other
places for pasture through the summer.  Oats and pease
