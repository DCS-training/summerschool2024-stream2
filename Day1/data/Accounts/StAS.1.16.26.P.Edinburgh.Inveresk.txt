     Statistical Account

to which this regality was astricted and thirled, is called
the Shire-mill, and the wood along the banks of the river,
of which little remains, is called Shire-wood; and Sherif-ball
at the extremity of the regality has acquired its name in
the same manner.

   Musselburg is an ancient ecclesiastical and incorporate
burgh, holden of the Lord Superior of the Regality, who is
now the Duke of Buccleugh, on payment of certain sums
annually as quit-rent or feu-duty.  The territories of the
Burgh extend along the sea-coast, the whole length of the
parish, and are about two measured miles and a half in
lenght, and from one half to one fourth of a mile in breadth.

   Charters.-The most ancient charter of this burgh now
extant is dated December 11, 1562, and is granted by Ro-
BERT Commendator of Dunfermline, with consent of the
whole members of the convent.  It narrates, 'That the
"title-deed belonging to the burgh were burnt by their
"enemies the English,after the fatal battle of Pinkie;
"therefore they of new grant, dispone, and confirm to the
"present bailies, community and inhabitants of Mussel-
"burgh, and to their successors," etc. which is not incon-
sistent with what has been befoe mentioned as a tradi-
tional account, viz.  That their first charter was procured,
by means of their attention to Randolph Earl of Murray,
who died in their town.  This charter is confirmed by
many subsequent charters and acts of Parliament, particularly

   under the gift.  But the proprietor contended, that it had ab ante been
gifted to him, which defence was sustained.  Certain parts, however,
of this regality and parish have been disjoined, and added to the parishes
of Cranfton, Newton, and Dalkeith.  This Lordship was held by the fa-
mily of Laudersdale till the year 1709, when it was purchased by the Da-
chess of Monmouth and Buccleugh.
