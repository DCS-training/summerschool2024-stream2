tains subjects and specimens connected witb the various branches
of natural history, mineralogy, geology, &c.  There is also a col-
lection of antiquities, a portion of which is rendered particularly
interesting, as they have been found in our own country, and some
of them in our own immediate neighbourhood.  The museum em-
braces likewise a valuable and interesting collection of coins.  The
English coins embrace the whole period from the time of Edgar
to that of William IV; the Scotch, from William the Lion to
James VI.  The Grecian coins consist of those of the princi-
pal petty states; of Philip, King of Macedon, and Alexander the
Great.  The Roman coins comprehend not only those of the Em-
perors, but also of the consuls, coadjutors, and usurpers.  The mu-
seum is always accessible to the public.
   Police.-The town of Peterhead obtained an act of Parliament,
in 1820, for supplying the inhabitants with water, and for paving,
lighting, and otherwise improving the streets.  Previous to the
passing of this act, the inhabitants were supplied with water from
the roofs of their houses, or from wells dug in the neighbourhood
of them; and in either case the supply was precarious, and the
water of bad quality.  Considerable expense had been incurred
in searching for good spring water within a moderate distance
from the town, but without success.  At length, in draining upon
the estate of Auchtigall, a very copious spring was found, yielding
upwards of forty gallons of pure spring water per minute.  This
spring is now conveyed to the town, a distance of 2 miles, 5 fur-
longs, and 10 yards; and the inhabitants enjoy the comfort of an
adequate supply of excellent water fit for every domestic purpose.
Before the Police Act was obtained, the streets had been much
improved by removing obstructions and inequalities, and substi-
tuting metalling for rough undressed stones, with which they were
paved.  Side paths were laid off, and paved either with dressed
granite, or crib and pebbles.
  The expenses incurred in bringing water into the town amount-
ed to L.3167.  The annual rate of assessment has hitherto been
1s. 9d. per pound, which is applied to pay the interest of the
money borrowed and for lighting the street and executing the
other purposes of the act.
   Post-Office.-The revenue of the post-office for the last seven
years has been as under.
