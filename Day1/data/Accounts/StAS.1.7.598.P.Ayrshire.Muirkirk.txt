     NUMBER LIV.

     PARISH OF MUIRKIRK.

     (County and Presbytery of Ayr.-Synod of Glasgow and
     Ayr.)

     By the Reverend Mr JOHN SHEPPARD.

     Name, Soil, and Surface.

   THIS parish was formerly called "the Muirkirk of
"Kyle;" and no person who looks on its face, can be
at any loss for the origin of its name.-No great proportion of
this parish is arable, or fit for tillage.  As the country is hilly,
the surface of the greater part of it is heath or hether, inter-
spersed with spots of verdure; both of which, taken together,
afford good pasture for sheep.  Where two thirds of the fur-
face is hether, and the other grass, the pasture is reckoned
by the sheep-farmers preferable to any other.  Even where
the plough is employed, which is the case in many parts of
this parish, the ground is not well adapted to the improve-
ments of agriculture.  The soil is, in general, mossy, and the
alternative commonly light and gravelly.  Some few spots,
indeed, are to be found where it is deep, and of a pretty
strong clay; but there bear no proportion to those of a con-
trary quality.  As much of the ground is wet or marshy,
draining is a most necessary improvement; indeed so neces-
sary, that it must be first in order, before any other can be
attempted with any possibility of success.
