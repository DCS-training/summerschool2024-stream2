ger tups.  Sheep have decreased here in number since the ge-
neral practice took place of laying down so much ground with
clover, and other green crops.-The people are, in general,
very regular in their attendance on public worship, and at
pains to have their children educated.  They are sober, in-
dstrious, charitable and humane, and live in great harmony
with the few dissenters in the parish.  The principal farmers
have now good houses, live in a very genteel style, are social
and hospitable, and their dress corresponds with their manner
of living.-Neither lime nor marl are found in the parish.
There are a few stone quarries, but of a bad quality, and very
inaccessible, for which reason there are no stone fences.  Earth-
en fences and ditches can only be obtained.  On these, some
have planted thorn hedges.  There is great scarcity of wood:
Only 3 plantations of firs, two of them young, and not fit, as
yet, for any purpose.  There is much ground covered with
heathy and fit for no purpose but planting.  No hard wood,
but a few trees about gentlemen's houses.  There is only 1
inn in the parish, on the post-road leading from Aberdeen to
Banff; and as there is no post-office, letters and newspapers
are left there by the post, and returns forwarded the same
way to the first office.  There are 7 corn-mills; and last year
3 threshing mills were erected, 2 of these go by horses, and 1
with water.  Two or three others are in forwardness.  There
is only 1 fair, principally for sheep.  No brewery or distille-
ry.  There are no manufactures established.  Women are
employed by the stocking merchants in Aberdeen in knitting
stockings, and in spinning flax for the linen manufactures.
There are a few Druidical circles, but not so large as in ma-
ny other places.  Superstition still spares them, though stones
are so scarce.  Also many cairns, etc.
