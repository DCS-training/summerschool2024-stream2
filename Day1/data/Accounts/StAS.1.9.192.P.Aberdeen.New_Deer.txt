     Statistical Account

ing to tradition, it was built by one Crawford; but at what
time we cannot learn.  It afterward came into the pos-
session of the Irvines of Drum, and is now the property of
Lord Aberdeen.  It is also said to have been one of the
last strong holds of James II.'s partisans, who, after the battle
of Killycrankie, possessed themselves of Fyvie castle, and,
being obliged to abandon it, took refuge in Fedderatt; but
were pursued, and expelled by King William's troops.  In
the west side of the parish there is an extensive piece of
moor, called Brucebill.  This is said to have been so named
from Edward, brother to King Robert Bruce.  Here he is
reported to have encamped soon after the battle of Inveru-
ry, and from this to have marched in pursuit of the Cum-
mins, to a place near the village of Deer, called Aiky-brae,
or Oaky-brae.  And this is partly corroborated by Joan
Major, (de. gest. Scot. Fol. 83. lib. 5.) who relates, that
Edward there engaged and routed the Cummins in the
year 1308.  In memory of this victory, the market of
Aiky fair is said to have been established, which stands on
the spot where the battle was fought.

   Population, etc.-From the return made to Dr Web-
ster 40 or 50 years since, the number of souls then was
2313.  The amount of the present population is 2800
souls, of whom 1324 are males, and 1476 females.  These
are all of the Established Church, except 156 Seceders,
(there being a Seceding meeting-house in the parish,) 40
Episcopalians, and 6 Roman Catholics.
