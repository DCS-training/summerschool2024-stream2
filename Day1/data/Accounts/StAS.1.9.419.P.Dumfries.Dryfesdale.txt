Lochmaben and Dumfries markets, and on some occasions
to the English markets, besides a variety of sea trout, her-
ling, skellies, eels, pike and burn trout.  The Dryfe runs
through this parish for about 3 miles on the N. W. part,
emptying itself into the Annan in a direct line, between
the market town of Lockerbie and the Royal Burgh of
Lochmaben.  It rises in the northern end of Hutton pa-
rish, and runs a course directly south about 11 miles.  It
is, in moderate weather, a small rivulet, clear and pure,
having in its pools plenty of trout, and some small salmon,
&c.; but in rainy weather, it comes down in swells, sud-
denly and rapidly, driving all before it that comes in its
way; hence the name, overspreading its holms, and in-
creasing the Annan  The gently rising hills on each side
are cultivated, or exhibit a beautiful verdure, and rich pa-
sture for cattle and sheep.  The Currie and Milk touching
it on the E. and S. E. also abound in trout and small sal-
mon.  The Currie is a small stream, about 5 miles long
from N. to S. deriving its name from its source, being a
Corrie, a Celtic term, signifying a confined cleugh or glen,
of which sort is the spring of the Annan, vulgarly called
the "Annan Peck," or the Marquis of Annandale's
"Beef Stand."  Its banks and contiguous farms afford the
richest pasture, and as rich crops of corn in favourable sea-
sons, as any high lying part of the country.  It empties
itself into the Milk, at the eastern extremity of the cen-
trical line of this parish.  The Milk, a limpid rivulet,
has on each side very rich land for arrage, but peculiarly
for pasturage to milk cows, hence the name.  It touches
this parish only for about a mile and a half, though its
course being partly west, and then south, is not less than 12
miles, when it discharges itself into the Annan opposite
the Watch Tower of Repentance in Cummertrees parish.
