   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are several remains
of Popish chapels.  Within these last 20 or 30 years, there
have been found in different places, 4 stones set upon edge,
with a large flag covering them, the opening about 4 1/2 feet by
2 1/2 in which human bones were deposited.-The people are
fond of a sea-faring life; during last war, from 25 to 30
able bodied seamen, from this parish, were employed in the
navy.  But they are not fond of a military one.-The
people in general are not expensive, a few individuals are
much addicted to dram drinking; and the young people,
especially the females, fond of dress, and more expen-
sive in that way than their circumstances can well afford.-
There are about 11 ale or rather whisky houses; one pro-
perly called an inn, being one of the stages on the line of 
road, lately made by the Duke of Argyle, between Inve-
raray and Dumbarton.-English is generally spoken, but
many understand and frequently converse in Gaelic.
