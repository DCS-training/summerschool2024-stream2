their work.  The parish blacksmith has a salary rated at
pecks meal, or 1 s. in money from every farthing land, a
is besides fed when employed.  There are four other black-
smiths in the country, who contrive to make out a poor
livelyhood by chance employ.  There is one bred shoemaker
who serves the gentleman's families.  The country leather
is poorly tanned with the juice of the tormcatile root, and
made it, to brogues for the servants and low tenantry.  There
are now 6 sloops (some time ago there were 9) employed in
the kelp trade, fishing, and other merchandise, for these hands
are occasionally procured in the country.  As their insular
situation renders the sea in a manner their element, all the in-
habitants on the sea-cost are, in some degree, mariners.  There
is one cooper in constant employ with an apprentice.  Of
those who are occasionally employed as house or boat carpen-
ters, the number exceeds 20, but most of them are also far-
mers.  Of spinsters and weavers, the number is almost equal
to that of householders, among the lower class of people,
whose wives and daughters both spin and weave their wool
into coarse cloths for the use of the family, and a few blan-
kets for sale.  There are besides 8 bred weavers who de-
pend on employ from the gentleman's families.  All the gen-
tlemen have gardens, producing cabbages, sallads, parsnips,
carrots, etc.  Turnips and onions rarely thrive, owing to a
worm, generated in the hot sandy soil, which corrodes them
in their progress towards maturity.  These gardens are ma-
naged under the inspection of the owner, by some of the
farm servants.  They begin to raise a few small fruits.
