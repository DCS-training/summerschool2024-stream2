   NUMBER XXVI.

   PARISH OF PENPONT.

   By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM KEYDEN.

   Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface.

   THE name of this parish is probably derived from pendents
pons, an arched bridge, there being a bridge of one se-
micicular arch, supported by two steep rocks, over the river
Scarr.  It is of very remote antiquity; nor is it known when it
was built.  The singularity of the structure, when nothing
of that kind excited here, might give occasion to the name.
At any rate, the name of the parish is very antient, as ap-
pears from inscriptions on the communion cups, in the be-
ginning of the 14th century.  Penpont is a presbytery seat.
and is situated in the synod and county of Dumsries.  It is
bounded by nine parishes, Glencairn, Tynron, Keir, Clofe-
burn, Morton, Durrisdeer, Sanquhar, New Cumnock, and
Dalry.  New Cumnock is in the presbytery of Air, Dalry in
that of kirkcudbright.  The parish is 16 Scottish miles
long, and, at an average, about 3 1/2 broad.  It extends from
south-east, at the lower extremity, by a continual ascent, to
the north-west, where the ground on the banks of the Scarr,
which has its source there, is 3500 feet above the level of the
river at the lowest part of it.  In this tract there are 4 steep
ridges, lengthways, with 3 deep and narrow glens, each wa-
tered by a very pure and plentiful stream.
