of 70 souls.-As the land in this neighbourhood was within

unnecessary to observe, that this village has very much im-
proved the appearance of the country around, as well as raised
the value of the adjacent grounds.-The feuers in these two
villages of Westruther and Hounslow have each a privilege
of peats for fuel in the mosses that are next them.-The
