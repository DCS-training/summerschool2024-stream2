of the whole lands in this district.  Three of the 6 estates in
the parish have changed proprietors within these 8 years, and
have sold at 30 years purchase or upwards.  In the course of
10 years, most of the farms have also changed their possessors.
For some time past land has risen in value.  Putachie, the
seat of the family of Forbes, lies in this parish.  The house
was built in 1731.  It commands a very pleasant view of the
Valley of Alford, of the windings of the river Don, and of
several gentlemens houses and plantations.  The buildings,
policy, and farm have been lately much improved and enlarged.
Adjacent to it, there is a natural wood of considerable extent,
which contains trees of most of the kinds common in the
North of Scotland, and produces 10 or 12 kinds of wild
fruit.  Roes are always to be found in it, and red and fallow
deer often frequent it.

   Population, etc.-The population has varied considerably
at different periods; but has greatly decreased within these
last 16 years, as will appear from the following table.

*This decrease has been owing partly to the increase of trade and manu-
factures at Aberdeen, and partly to the failure of the crops in 1782 and 1783,
but chiefly to peculiar and temporary causes, not likely again to recur.
