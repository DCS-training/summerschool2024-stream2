longing to the Establishment, capable of accommodating 1500 per-

   Constitution of the Burgh-In 1775, a charter was obtained
from Parliament conferring on the town the privileges of a burgh
of barony, and granting a constitution which vested the manage-
ment of its municipal affairs in a council of 13, including 2 bail-
ies.  By the late Burgh Reform Act, the number was reduced
to 9; consisting of a provost, 2 bailies, and 16 councillors.  The
town has by the Reform Bill been elevated to the rank of a Par-
liamentary burgh. It embraces a constituency of 211 qualified
voters; and joins with Kilmarnock, Rutherglen, Dumbarton, and
Renfrew, in sending a Member to Parliament.
  Revenue.-In the year 1834, the revenue amounted to l.195l,
7s. 7d.,-obtained from the rent of church seats, from a tax on
houses, from anchorage-dues, dock-dues, the rent of warehouses,
the sale of gas, flesh and fish markets, and a few other sources of
public income. About the one-half of this revenue is required to
pay the interest of an accumulated debt; and the remainder goes
to meet the necessary demands for minister's stipend, the salaries
of public officers, and other expenses incurred in conducting the
affairs of the town, and promoting the comfort of its inhabitants.

                        III.-POPULATION.
There are no documents from which to ascertain the exact num-
ber of people that resided in this parish at the time of its erec.
tion.  In 1700, it did not contain a population of more than 400
souls; but in 1718, when the first parish church was built, the in-
habitants amounted to twice that number.  From this period the
population continued steadly, though not rapidly, to increase, un-
til the year 1790, when it consisted of 4036 persons. In conse-
quence of the American war, which had an injurious effect on the
trade of this place, the population underwent a Considerable dimi-
nution; for by the census that took place by order of Government,

     The comparatively show increase of population in this place, and
its occasional falling off, may be traced to the fluctuations of fo-
reign trade, on which it has chiefly depended for its support, and
