1770, another lease was granted at L. 1: 18: 6 d per acre.
And in A. D 1792, the last lease was granted at L. 2: 10 s
per acre.  The valued rent of the parish is L. 3559; 8 s Scots,
and the real rent at present is reckoned about L. 3000, ex-
clusive of the coal and salt.  In general, the ground over all
the parish is in good order, and capable of the highest im-
provement.  A farmer employs 2 or 3 ploughs, with some-
times 2 horses, and sometimes 4 in a plough.  No oxen are
employed for the purposes of husbandry, and grain appears a
greater object than pasturage.  The average price of a good
horse reared in the parish, and 5 years old, is L. 20.  A good
cow of the same age, is sold at L. 6.  Beans, wheat, peas,
barley, and oats, are sown in rotation.  Beans, peas, and
oats are sown in March and April; barley in April, and the
beginning of May; wheat for the most part is sown in Sep-
tember and October.  If the season is favourable, harvest be-
gins in August, and ends in October.  The crop is reaped by
domestics, day labourers, or servants hired for the purpose,
and their wages vary according to contingent circumstances.
Within these 20 years sown grass has been introduced into
the parish, and pretty good crops of hay have been produced.
Besides many clumps of young firs in a thriving state, there
are upwards of 70 acres of natural wood in the vicinity of
Kinniel house.

of Muir-house, afterwards to be mentioned; it holds of the
Crown by a charter from Charles II.  His Grace the present
Duke never resided in the parish.  The house of Kinniel,
an ancient seat of that noble family, is large and habitable.
It is built on the top of a beautiful bank, about 50 feet above
the level of the sea.  The architecture seems ancient, though
