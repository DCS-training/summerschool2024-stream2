     of Irvine.

to this convent, which, from its purport, may be supposed
to be long after its foundation, is from a contract and inden-
ture, dated at Irvine, 24th August 1399, between Reynald
Fullarton of that Ilk, and the provincial brethren and con-
vent of the Carmelite Friars near Irvine, for the purpose of
paying 40 merks* , for meliorating and upholding the houses
of the said convent, and for repairing the principal kirk and
cloister; and they were thereby obliged, in all time coming,
to pray weekly, on the Lord's day, or any other feast day,
in the beginning of a mass at the great altar, with an audible
voice, for the souls of Sir Adam, and Marjory his wife, and
for Reynald, and Elizabeth his wife, and their heirs and suc-
cessors, and for the souls of all the faithful deceased.
   We are informed of some emoluments which belonged to
this friary, from an act passed in the reign of James VI. which
does much honour to the memory of that Prince.  It ought
therefore to be more particularly known, and should render
the name of James dear to the inhabitants of this town.  At
a time when the church livings belonging to the Popish
clergy were generally bestowed upon court parasites, we find
this Monarch appropriating what was within the liberties of
this burgh to a much more laudable purpose.
   This act bears, that his Majesty had made a perpetual grant
to the provost, bailies, counsellors, and community of the
burgh of Irvine, and their successors, "of all and singular
the lands, houses, buildings, churches, chaplainaries, orchards,
gardens, crofts, annualrents, fruits, rents, profits, emoluments,
farms, alms, anniversaries of deaths whatever," which any
way pertained to any chaplainaries, alterages, and prebenda-
ries within any church, chaplainary, or college, founded by
any patrons of the same within the liberties of the said burgh
