and family are Presbyterians.  They all attend the catechisings.
The people, in general, are sober, intelligent, and industrious;
charitable, according to their circumstances, and regular in
attending upon the ordinances of religion; though it is to be
regretted, that, in this last respect, the gentry are far from
being exemplary, to those whom they deem much their in-
feriors.  It is so far fortunate, however, that the vulgar, as
they are called, do not imitate their betters, otherwise we
should have very thin churches.  There is not perhaps so
much of the outward shew of religion among the people, as
in some other districts, especially where the Secession has ob-
tained; but, among the ordinary ranks, there is much de-
cency, and, it is to be hoped, not a little real devotion.  One
thing, however, is still matter of just complaint, through se-
veral counties in this northern division of the island; too
great laxness and latitude, in the manner of observing the
Sabbath day; and which, instead of being devoted to reli-
gious exercises, is often spent in travelling on journies; giv-
ing and receiving visits; sending servants abroad, on errands
and messages; and so abstracting them altogether from the
stated returns of public and social worship, which, to many,
is almost the only means of instruction they can enjoy.  It is
certainly matter of regret, that in a civilized age and coun-
try, not to say a Christian land, and where we justly boast
of so many other improvements, so much refinement in po-
liteness, dress, diversons, etc. there should be so much cold-
ness, not to say neglect and contempt, with regard to piety
and the public ordinances of religion; and so little counten-
ance shewn them, by those who have it so greatly in their
power, and who surely ought, to be exemplary to others, in
this first and fundamental duty of every rational being.
