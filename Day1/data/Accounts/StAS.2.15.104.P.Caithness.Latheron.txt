much more profitable.  On an average there may be about
10,000 cod cured in a season, for which 6d. each may be ob-
tained.
   Lobsters also are in great abundance, and frequently many of
them are taken in boxes; but this trade is little  attended to, as the
herring trade has been the all-engrossing business for many years
back.
    There are two salmon-fishing stations in the parish, viz. at
Berriedale and Dunbeath, the former belonging to Mr Horne of
Langwell, and the latter to Mr Sinclair of Freswick.  At Berrie-
dale, salmon and grilse are frequently caught in great abundance,
particularly since the berring-fishing was discontinued there.  It
is rented by the Messrs Hogarth of Aberdeen, and the fishing at
Dunbeath by Mr Martin of Dundee, the former at L. 275, and
the latter at L.27.  This great difference in rent is chiefly occa-
sioned by the herring-fishing at the latter place having a ten-
dency to annoy the fish, and frighten them from the shore.  In
other respects, Dunbeath seems the preferable station, as the chan-
nel of the river is always open.  The fish on both rivers are good;
that of Berriedale particularly so.  Very few of them are sold in
the parish, on account of the high price demanded; salmon 1s., and
grilse 6d. per lb.  They are kitted and sent to the London market.

able difficulty, under the following heads:

			    V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
   Market-Town.-There is no market-town in the  parish.  The
nearest to it is Wick, the county town, which is at the medium
distance of twenty miles.  Several villages have been projected,
but none of them have yet arisen to any consequence except Lyb-
ster, which constains many excellent houses, and a population of
fully 400 individuals.  Several new buildings are now in progress,
and many of the inhabitants are very respectable.  It was com-
