and still are making, to meliorate the grain, and increase the
quantity, by the modern plans of husbandry, with lime, marl,
and fallowing, the effect of which, however, in this unpropi-
tious soil and climate, is only a greater quantity of straw.
The reason the farmers ascribe for this unprofitable train of
culture, is the necessity they lie under of providing winter
food for their cattle.  These indeed, and sheep, are, and
ought to be, the great object of their attention, as the prin-
cipal, and, at present, almost the only source of subsistence
and wealth.

   Manners of the Inhabitants, etc.-Neither the records of
the parish, the monuments of antiquity, nor the custom, and
morals of the inhabitants, exhibit any object particularly
meriting the attention of the philosopher, the politician, or
the moralist, unless this, which, though not a singular, is
rather an uncommon fact, that its history, for ages past, may,
with the strictest regard to truth, be comprehended in a few
words, "One generation passeth and another cometh."
   There is here neither town nor village.  Annexed to each
farm-stead are a few cottages, reared, in general, of turf and
stone.  The inhabitants are poor and indolent, contented
and frugal.  The indigent, to the number of 12 or 13, are
supported by a poor's rate, levied equally upon the landlords
and tenants, and the collections in church, amounting in all
to about 30 L. per annum, which so fully supplies the needy,
that there is not an itinerant beggar in the parish.  From
the purity of the air, and the temperance of the inhabitants,
fewer diseases prevail here than in any spot of Scotland per-
haps of the same extent.  Agues, rheumatisms, and con-
sumptions, are the most frequent.  Wine is only seen at fu-
nerals, whiskey at weddings; and, in 2 or 3 houses excepted,
ale is a stranger.
