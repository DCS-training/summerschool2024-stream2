the coal at Stonelaw.  It sells at 5 s. 6 d: the ton on the
hill; and is delivered at Clyde iron-work for 6 s. 6 d.
There are two excellent free-stone quarries in the parish,
which have been wrought for some hundred years past.
The stones find ready sale in Glasgow and its neighbour-

   Public houses.-Rutherglen is by no means destitute of
grocery shops and public houses.  Of the latter there are
no fewer than 26 within the town.  These, although more
than sufficient for ordinary demands, are not able to ac-

hurtful neither to the revenues of Government, nor inte-
rest of the community, is profitable to some industrious fa-
milies who inhabit capacious houses.

of the victual.  The glebe contains 4 1/2- acres, part of which
is occupied by the manse and offices.  The Magistrates
