   There is no village either in the parish, or in the whole

luxuries, but even many of the common necessaries of life,
must be sent for to the distance of more than forty miles.
Tradesmen have no fixed place of residence where they can
be resorted to.  There is no centre for the little traffic, or
barter, requisite to be carried on in an inland country.  The
wool that could have been manufactured in the place, must
be sent by a long land carriage to buyers invited from ano-
ther kingdom.  The slax that might have proved a source of
wealth to both proprietor and tacksman, has been neglected,
because skilful people are not collected in one close neigh-
bourhood, to carry it through the whole process.

   Population, etc.-The number of inhabitants ascertained
by a late survey, amounts to 1803.  Of these there are
males above ten years of age 645, females 693,-children of
both sexes under ten years of age 645,-tot. 1 as above.  It
is to be regretted, that no date sufficiently accurate to form
any proper estimate of the inhabitants in past times, are to
be found.  If an opinion may be hazarded, where facts only
ought to be attended to, there is reason to think that the
number of inhabitants within the last thirty years has de-
creased; but not greatly.  Dr Webster's report makes this 
parish contain 1900 souls.

No table of burials has been kept.
