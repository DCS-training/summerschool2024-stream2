   Here we have 471 weavers beads of families, with 2473 de-
pendent on them; or making up parts of their families; whereas
38 farmers with their large incomes and greater need ofassistance,
have only 240 living along with them, either as dependents or as
members of their households. The average number of individuals
in a weaver's family is five and a fraction; in a farmer's family,
six and a fraction; but the means of support cannot be calculated
by the same ratio.
   In speaking of the babits of the people collectively, we may say

possession of landed property frequently inspires, perhaps, may
occasion too many law-suits." In this respect, they are certainly
naturaly not more pugnacious than their neighbours, although
the great subdivision of property among them creates also a sub-
division'of rights, and of course, furnishes a greater opening for
law-suits. This is certainly one evil arising from an extensive
subdivision of heritable rights, but it has also its counterbalancing
