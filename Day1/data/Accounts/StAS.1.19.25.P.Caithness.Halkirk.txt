All the families above stated, excepting those of tradesmen,
day-labourers, etc. are farmers, tenants, subtenants, cotta-
gers.

   Births, Marriages, Burials.-The annual average of
births, marriages, burials, cannot be ascertained with any
tolerable accuracy.  By examining the register, I found
there were 80 baptisms and 24 marriages recorded from
January 1789 to January 1790; but I much suspect their
number ought to have been more; and I have reason for
this suspicion, because some few may be baptised, and some
few married by the missionary in this parish, and the neigh-
bouring clergymen, whose names might have been ne-
glected to be reported to the session-clerk.  This circum-
stance, together with some who die unbaptised, and who
are not therefore reported and recorded, may well account
for this mistake.  Indeed, these numbers of baptisms and
marriages exceed what they were in the same space of
time for several years before, according to the register.
From these very probable circumstances, I may safely con-
clude the annual average of births for a few years past to
be about 85, and that of marriages about 28.  The number
of deaths or burials I found on the register in the period
above mentioned to be 24, which is by no means satisfac-
tory, and puts it entirely out of my power to ascertain the
precise average, especially when it is considered, that in
order to elude payment of the tax, numbers use alI the shifts
they can; besides, there are no less than 10 burial places
in the parish, which gives numbers an ample opportunity
to escape from both register and tax.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Many of the proposed sta-
tistical queries have no relation to this parish in its present
