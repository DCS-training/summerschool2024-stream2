   The annual average of births for the last 7 years, as
taken from the parish register, is 46.  The average num-
ber of children, produced by each marriage, may be about

grazings.  Probably the present high rate of wages may
have had some effect, in decreasing the population, by ob-
liging the tenants to keep sewer servants than formerly.
To this it may be added, that numbers of young men and
women, from 11 years of age to 28 or 30, leave the parish
yearly, to go to service, or to learn trades in the low
countries; some of whom, however, occasionally return to
settle in their native place.
