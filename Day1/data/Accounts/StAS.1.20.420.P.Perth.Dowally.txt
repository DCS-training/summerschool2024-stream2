of Maison Dieu, and its magnificent cathedral*.  For this
sacrilegious misdemeanour, he was compelled by his father
to appear, barefoot and in sackcloth, at the door of the
Black Friars church in Perth, and afterwards to promise, at
the high altar, where the King and Nobles were assembled,
indemnification to the bishop of Moray.  He died in 1394,
His monument consists of his effigies recumbent, in armour,
and large as life; and is supported by a row of ornamented
pillars, intermixed with figures.  The following inscription
is upon it: "Hic jacet Dominus Alexander Senescallus
"Comes de Buchan, et Dominus de Badenach, bene memo-
"riae, qui obiit 20 die menfis Februarii, anno Dom. 1394."
This monument remained entire till the Revolution.  A
party of Angus' Cameronians, stationed at that time in 
Dunkeld, mutilated and defaced it.  Still, however, it is in
tolerably complete preservation.
   Near it, a plain stone, fixed in the north wall, bears an
inscription sacred to the memory of the last commissary
Thomas Bisset.  It contains a well expressed eulogy on the
strict integrity and blameless manners of the man, and is
one of the few instances where a tombstone speaks nothing
but the truth.
   On the north side of the quire is the chapter-house.  It
was built by Bishop Lauder in 1469, and is still, as described
by Abbet Mill, "a fine firm fabric." In a vault below it is
the burying-place of the family of Atholl.  The upper
room, to which one ascends by a narrow stair, is occupied
by the Duke as a charter-room.
   Passing from the quire into the body of the cathedral, the
spectator is struck by the union of simplicity and elegance
