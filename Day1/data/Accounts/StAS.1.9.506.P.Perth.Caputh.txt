It is now distinguished by a clump of trees.  Inchtuthel is like-
wise believed to have been part of the land granted by Ken-
neth III. (who began his reign in 977,) to Hay for his bra-
very in the battle of Luncarty; and his descendents* possessed
it till the beginning of the 17th century.  There appears
to have been a Roman station 3 miles to the east of this,
in the moor of Meiklour, towards the extremity of the
parish.  The line of the Roman military road leading thi-
ther, can be still traced through the parishes of Scone, St
Martin's, and Cargill: and this road seems unquestionably
to be the continuation of that which passed through Strath-
ern, and crossed the Tay at Rome, a little to the westward
of Scone, where probably there was a bridge of wood over
the river+.  Where the Roman road touches on the Isla, a
bridge is also supposed to have stood, of which the necessity
is evident, for the purpose of opening a communication
from the south with the station near Meiklour, and by con-
sequence with the champaign country, both east and west,
as far as the Grampian Mountains.  Here the Romans
raised a wall of earth, about 24 feet thick, (for it is difficult
to ascertain the exact measurement,) defended by a ditch on
each side, 6 feet distant from the wall.  This wall, which is
now named the Cleaving Dike, stretched above two miles
and a half, from the ancient course of the Tay to the Isla;
which, by their commodious junction two miles below,
completely secured the station.  The space inclosed is in
the form of a delta.  In this area, there are several explo-
ratory mounts; one, apparently artificial, (now called the
