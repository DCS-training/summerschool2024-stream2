   The duration of leases is nineteen years, and every encourage-
ment has been given by the proprietors to respectable and indus-
trious tenants.  The greater part of, the farm buildings are excel-
lent, commodious, and suitable to the occupants.  The landlords
are not much given to change, and consequently the tenants are
seldom turned out of their possessions.  Indeed, many of the an-
cestors of the present generation for more than a century have
been inhabitants of the parish, and, in several instances, were tacks-
men of the same farms which their descendants now occupy.
There are at present living upon the lands of Logie Elphinstone
three brothers and two sisters, all above seventy years of age,
and whose united ages amount to 390 years.  With the excep-
tion of eleven years residence in a neighbouring parish, they, to-
gether with their paternal and maternal ancestors, have been te-
nants in the parish for about 120 years.
