on a neck or point of land, which stretches out on a level with
the sea, there being a similar point on the opposite shore ex-
tending, in like manner, into the sea, as if to meet it.  There are
also two points of exactly the same description, a short way up
the bay, which, together, occasion the curvature in the appear-
ance of the bay mentioned above.  Along the N. side of the pa-
rish, and immediately above the town, there is a beautiful ver-
dant bank, extending from the eastern to the western extremity of
the parish; the bulk of the arable land hangs over this bank,
in a sloping manner, and presents one uninterrupted corn-
field, without any eminence to intercept the view.  To a
traveller riding through the parish, by the public road to In-

the country is flat and moorish.  The town of Cromarty was
formerly a royal burgh, but was disfranchised by an act of
the Privy Council of Scotland, in consequence of an applica-

a deep black mould; it is, in general, however, remarkably
wet, owing to a hard pan, or rocky substance in the bottom,
which prevents the water from sinking beneath the surface.
The soil in the country part of the parish is various; it is al-
so, in general, wet, and the labour of the husbandman often much
retarded, by consequence, in the spring season.

   Natural Curiosities.-Of these, this parish is not very pro-
ductive; it would, however, be a defect in this account, were
no mention made of a large rock, considerable in height,
which is termed "M'Farquhar's Bed."  What renders this
rock remarkable, is the grandeur of an arch, which forms a
natural bridge under the rock, admitting the waves of the sea
to pass out and in with a tremendous appearance.  A still
more remarkable curiosity than the former, is a cove or ca-
