stands.  For many years it remained in a ruinous state, till,
upon an application to the heritors, both it and the manse
were repaired.  The present incumbent was admitted minis-
ter in 1788, upon the translation of Mr Welsh to Drum-
melzier.  His Grace the Duke of Queensberry is patron.
The stipend is paid in money, and amounts to about 70 l.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are two very high hills
in the parish, called Scrape and Dollarburn, from whence
there is an extensive view of the Lothians, Berwickshire,
and the English Borders.  The latter of these is supposed to
be 2840 feet above the level of the sea.  No antiquities are
to be found in this parish, but a Roman camp, which is
pretty entire; in the neighbourhood of which were found,
some years ago, a Roman urn, and some antient coms, upon
digging up a piece of ground, with a view to till it.  At a
small distance from this camp, there is a tower raised upon an
eminence, and commanding the best view in the parish.  It
appears to have been built several hundred years ago, and
to have served as a watch tower, to give signals of alarm.
when the enemy made inroads upon the country, and com-
mitted depredations.  This parish, like others in the neigh-
bourhood, labours under great disadvantages, by being about
18 miles distant from coals.  They are generally bought in
summer, and cost about 1 1/2 d. the stone.  The greater part
of the inhabitants, however, use peats.
