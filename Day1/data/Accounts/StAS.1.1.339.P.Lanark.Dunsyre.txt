     of Dunsyre.

   By the returns made to Dr Webster about 1750, there
were 359 inhabitants then in the parish, so that it appears
the population has made little or no progress in 40 years,
though it is said that, about 1783, the number of inhabitants
was about 400, the decrease since that period being owing to
the enlargement of farms, and pulling down of cottages.  All
the parishioners, except about 40 hectares of various denomi-
nations, are of the established church; and, from the regis-
ters, it appears there were 14 baptised, and 9 buried, between
1st January 1788 and 1st January 1791.  There are in the
parish three heritors, none of whom reside, one clergyman,
twelve farmers, two students, a few weavers, smiths, masons,
wright, and taylors, who have about half a dozen appren-
tices.

   Ecclesiastical State.-Tha annual value of the living is
L. 100, exclusive of the manse and glebe, which last may be
worth L. 10 a year.  The King is patron, and the parson is
titular of the tythes.  The manse was built in 1756.  The
kirk is old, but in tolerable repair.  The number of poor re-
ceiving charity are 7 to 8, supplied by the collections, and the
interest of a small fund of L. 90.

   Natural Productions, Etc.-In general, there is not much
wood in the parish; it is chiefly fir, ash, and a few limes.
Some oats are sent to the Glasgow market, as are also sheep,
and turnip fed cattle.  The artificial grasses are clover, rye-
grass, and a little rib-grass; the times of sowing and reaping
are various.  In good seasons, the harvest here is three, in a
wet year six, weeks later than in Mid or East Lothian.  Dun-
syre Hill is rocky and green.  The other rising grounds in
the parish are covered with black heath.  Peat is produced
in the parish; but there is no coal nearer than twelve miles.
