or Speymouth, all of Glenmore sir.  Among others, there 
is one now on the stocks, above 500 tons.  Without doubt,
these manufactures raise the price of labour and other arti-
cles, and mke servants for the farmer more difficult to be
got.  The sir-woods of this country exceed all the natural
sir-woods in Scotland put together, without comparison.
Sir James Grant's woods of Abernethy, of many miles
circumference; next, the Duke of Gordon's, in Glen-
more; then Mr Grant of Rothiemurchus's, who is suppo-
sed to have more trees than either of them; then the Duke's
again; after that, the Laird of M'Intosh's in Glensishy,
all in a line, of about 20 miles in length, on the south side
of Spey, and all having the advantage of abundance of
water to bring them to Spey.  Besides, Sir James Grant
has another wood, of an excellent quality, on the other side
of the country, on the river Dulnan*.

   Populations.-According Dr Webster's report, the popul-
lation then was 1670.  The exact number in this parish at
present is 1760, of which 262 are below 7 years of age.
Births, at an average for 6 years past, 45; marriages, 10.

   Produce, and State of Husbandry.-The animal produc-
tions consist of black cattle, sheep, some goats and horses.
The principal proprietor does not encourage great sheep-
farms, nor are there any large tracts laid waste for such
stocks.  It is computed, that two or three farms in Aber-
nethy which are wholly given to sheep, and what the Eng-
lish Company have in their own possession in Kincardine
without tenants, had abut 200 inhabitants when let in
