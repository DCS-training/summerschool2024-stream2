are perceivable both above and below the tide mark.  The 
neighbouring people, when fuel is scarce, often carry off from
thence parcels of coal, though of an exceeding poor quality.
A pit was sunk in Piltoun wood in 1788, but was soon aban-
doned on account of the badness of the coal; and there are
in the links of Roystoun the vestiges of several pts.  On the
lands of Marchfield is a spring of mineral water, called the 
Well of Spaw, reckoned beneficial in scorbutic cafes, and
highly purgative when taken in quantities.

   Village of Cramond.-The village of Cramond, situated on
the east tide of the Amon, at its junction with the Forth,
contains 74 families, 300 inhabitants, mostly iron workmen,
sailors, and day labourers.  It has a harbour, (specified in the
records of Exchequer as a creek within the port of Leith)
to which belong 7 sloops, chiefly employed by the iron works,
measuring 288 tons, and manned with 23 seamen and ap-
prentices.  The Amon is navigable only for the space of a 
quarter of a mole above its mouth.

   Church, Patron, Stipend, and School.-The church was ori-
ginally built in 1656, but has been frequently repaired and
enlarged since that time.  The patron is Mr Ramsay of
Barnton.  The stipend, as augmented in 1765, is, money,
L. 58:5:O; barley, 44 1/2 bolls; oats, 33 1/2 bolls; wheat, 10
bolls; meal, 8 bolls; with a commodious manse, and a glebe
of above 5 acres of rich land.  The schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 10: 2: 11, with 4 1/2 bolls of barley.  The interest of L 25
was granted by Sir John Inglis in 1786 for a Sunday school.
The fees for writing and English are 1 s. 4 d. the quarter;
for Arithmetic and Latin 3 s.  There are besides two private
schools.  The scholars at the three schools, taken together,
may annually amount to 150.
