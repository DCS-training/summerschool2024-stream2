prepared them by threshing them with flails, others by
beating them with mallets in a stone trough.  This is pre-
ferable to threshing, especially if the mallets be hooped
or caped with iron.  But these methods are tedious and
toilsome, and many might have a machine moved by wa-
ter for executing this work.  Here a question occurs, viz.
What kind of a machine would be fittest for the purpose?
The only one hitherto tried is constructed on the model of
a waulkmill or fullingmill.  With some alterations and im-
provements it might answer the end; but I am of opinion,
that two thick weighty mill-stones, to go upon their edge
like to those used in oil-mills for bruising linseed, would
answer better.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-It is thought impolitic to
allow corporations and societies to purchase much land, and
there seems to be a general prejudice against it; because,
when they get possession of any heritage, they retain it.
This is considered as a bar to that rotation of property so
beneficial to society, and so favourable to the spirit of en-
terprize.  If this prejudice cannot be removed, it may be
diminished, by considering, that although corporations sel-
dom make an entire and unreserved sale of their property,
they frequently make a partial disposal of their right, when
they feu, or let their lands in fee; for this gives a perpe-
tual right to the feuer, or holder, and his heirs, on paying
a certain yearly rent.  But it is generally required, that
he sink a particular sum, or pay down some hundreds of
pounds as a gratuity, at the conclusion of the bargain, more
or less, according to the value and extent of the land.  Thus
there arises a twofold property: A fixed annual sum is
paid to the corporation, as original proprietor or superior,
but they have no concern with the land nor the tenants.
