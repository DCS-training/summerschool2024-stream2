the land with artificial grasses, introduced by the incumbent in
1737, has contributed greatly to increase the quantity, as well
as to improve the quality, of these articles of produce.  To the
same cause is evidently to be ascribed the improvement which
has taken place in this district, with regard to the breed of
horses and black-cattle.  Both are incomparably better fed,
during winter as well as summer, since the introduction of
these grasses.  Instead of the naked pastures upon which the
horses were formerly driven, the greater part, even of the smallest

which is cut twice or thrice in the season, and given the cat-

successful in recommending to the tenants to plant rows of
trees around their grass inclosures, as a shelter and ornament

which has been wrought above a century, to the great benefit
of Air and the neighbourhood.  On the property of the in-

mise a long and cheap supply to the country of that necessary
article of life.  In the lands of Dalmore, upon the banks of
the river Air, is a species of whetstone, well known in the
country by the name of the Water of Air Stone: it has been
exported to different parts of Europe and America, and has
been found preferable to every other stone for sharpening edge
tools.  Near the same place is also a quarry of black lead, spe-
cimens of which have been sent to Whitehaven, and have been
