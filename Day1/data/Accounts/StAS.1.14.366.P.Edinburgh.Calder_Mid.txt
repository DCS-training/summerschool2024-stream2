durated clay, and a petriolic schistus, which burns with
a bright flame, but leaves a large residue of ashes.
Schistus of this kind seems to differ very little from
coal, but by having combined with it a smaller quantity
of the bituminous principle.  Moreover, coal has been
got in different parts of the country not far from this;
and it is to be hoped, that circumstances will occur,
which will give sufficient encouragement to have it 
wrought for the benefit of people in the neighbourhood.
There is good free stone in the parish; not much gra-
nite, and many of the rocks are a species of indurated 
clay.  There is plenty of iron stone, and some of it 
effervesces considerably with an acid.  There is also
lime stone; and in the parish of East Calder, about 1
mile from this town, Lord Morton has a quarry, where 
the stratum is 60 feet in thickness.-Upon the whole,
let me quote a passage from a survey, which Mr. Wil-
liams has lately made of the estates belonging to Sir
William Augustus Cunyngham of Livingston, Baronet,
which are in this neighbourhood, contigous to the ri-
vers Briech and Almond. " Beside tha coal and lime, 
the quantity of good iron stone which crosses these ri-
vers is so very great, that if a canal come this way,"
which has lately been in contemplation, " the vicinity
of these rivers will soon become an important scene of 
manufactures and very useful improvements."
   On the estate of Letham, belonging to Sir W. A.
Cunyngham there is a spring of sulphureous water.  It 
does not appear to be different from other fountains of 
that kind.  Like the waters of Harrowgate, and other
fulphureous springs, it has been found to be beneficial
in various diseases; but more especially in cases of scro-
fula and gravel.  The influence which has been ascribed
