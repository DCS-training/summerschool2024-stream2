   Parish Records.-For about 20 years past, a regular list has
been kept of marriages, births, and deaths; before that pe-
riod, the accounts are very imperfect, often broken off, in
some places hardly legible, seem to have been irregularly
taken, or, if regular, are now lost.

be computed at about 1100.  The word computed is used
because, in a crowd of people, that are perpetually shifting,
some going and some coming in their room, it is difficult to
mark the precise number for even a few weeks; and were
the numbers now fixed, they would not probably remain the
same till the account of them is published.  They wills how-
ever, in all probability, greatly increase, and that in a few
years.

   Horses, Sheep, etc.-The number of horses has increased
considerably within these few years.  The iron works, in
their several imployments, maintain about 30, and these,
together with those employed in other parts of the parish
