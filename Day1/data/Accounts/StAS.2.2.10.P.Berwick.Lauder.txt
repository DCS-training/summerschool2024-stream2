yards.  Irrigation, though it be here unknown, might be advanta-
geously practiced on several spots. Embanking is nearly confined
to the policy grounds of Thirlstane Castle, but it would be de-
sirable that this improvement should be extended along the whole
course of the Leader, as from the circuitous course of the river,
and the gravelly nature of the subsoil, considerable damage is oc-
cassionally done to the best lands in the parish.
   The duration of leases is almost universally nineteen years.
When the farm requires to be limed all over, and much of it to
be drained, it might be expedient that this period should be ex-
tended to twenty-five years, to allow the tenant sufficient time to
reap the full benefit of his outlay.
   The farm-buildings ate, on the whole, good, and so also are the
enclosures.  Great and striking improvements, by draining, liming,
and enclosing, have recently been made in the parish by various
individuals, and, in particular, on the farms of Wood head and
Wyndhead,--the former occupied by the noble proprietor, the
Earl of Lauderdale, and the latter by his son, Sir Anthony Mait-
land, on both of which farms every species of improvement is ra-
pidly advancing to the limits of perfection.  On these farms, as
well as on one lately let, belonging to the Marquis of Tweeddale,
superior office-houses have been erected, and the latter and Sir
Anthony's have steam thrashing-machines, being the only machines
of the description in this district of the county.
   There is still a considerable quantity of arable land unenclosed.
This may be owing to the unsuitableness of the soil for growing
thorns in some places, and to the want of building materials in
others; but now that whins or furze have been tried, and found to
be no bad substitute for these, it is hoped that this defect will be
speedily remedied.

<FOOTNOTE> Every person must be aware that it is difficult to obtain a correct or even a
nearly correct estimate of the raw produce raised in a parish of such great extent,
and farmed by so many individuals.  It is probable that the total value of the pro-
duce is greater than what is exhibited in the above statement.
