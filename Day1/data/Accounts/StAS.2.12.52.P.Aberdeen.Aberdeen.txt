introduced, by which the hospital was represented as subsidiary
to the United Fund, and dependent on it for a considerable yearly
sum, towards defraying its expenses.  This, however, was not the
case, and on a careful scrutiny and separation of the various
sources of revenue belonging to both, which was made in the year
1828, it was found that the income accruing to the Poor's Hospital
was abundantly sufficient for all its wants, and since that time the
accounts have been kept entirely distinct.  The house which had
been occupied since 1740 by the hospital being found to stand in
the way of projected improvements in the jail and court-house,
was purchased from the managers, and the hospital was removed
in the year 1818, to a house in the Gallowgate, which they bought.
Subsequently to this, the managers wished to increase the number of
the inmates, but the accommodations being inadequate, they, in
the year 1829, purchased a house of larger size in the Upper
Kirkgate, and since then, fifty boys have been maintained and edu-
cated in the " Boys' Hospital;" and as there is still a certain sur-
plus of funds, proposals have been at various times entertained for
still further extending the institution.  The age of admission into
this hospital is from eight to ten, and the boys received into it are
taught the ordinary branches of education,-reading, writing,
arithmetic, church music, and the principles of religion.  The
sources from which the income of the hospital is derived, are va-
rious mortifications or bequests secured on land, together with a
collection annually in the churches of the Establishment, and se-
veral of the Dissenting chapels.  The following table shows the
income and expenditure for seven years; the number of inmates
being fifty-five, viz. matron, schoolmaster, treasurer, and two ser-
vants in addition to fifty boys:

   Girls' Hospital.- The want of an institution for the mainte-
nance and education of girls, similar to the Boys' Hospital had been
for some time felt and regretted and, in 1828, a subscription was
entered into for the purpose of obtaining a fund for the establish-
of such an hospital.  This, in the course of a few months,
amounted to L. 1500, and the Girls' Hospital was opened for the
reception of twenty girls, the children or orphans of parochial
