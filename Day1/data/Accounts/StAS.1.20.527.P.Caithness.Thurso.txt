four free fairs yearly; but that of the yearly fairs, only two
are in use to be held, viz. one on St Peter's Day, and one
commencing in August, and ending in September.

     SECT. II.  Markets.-The weekly markets are held re-
gularly every Friday, and afford to the inhabitants a sure
and regular supply of butchers-meat, fish, poultry, and gar-
den stuffs.  Not many years ago, these articles were to be
had at very moderate prices; beef and mutton so low as 1 d.
or 1 1/2 d. per lb. weight; but now a pound of beef or mutton
cannnot be bought under 4 d. and the smallest quantity of
beef that can be purchased, is a quarter; so that, in fact, the
consumer pays equal to 5 d. or 6 d. per lb. for choice pieces.
Other articles of provisions have advanced in the same pro-
portion.  A goose, which sold for 8 d. now draws 1 s. 6 d. or
1 s. 8 d.; and a barn-yard fowl, which sold currently for
3 d. now gives 5 d. or 6 d.  Fish has also increased two or
threefold in price; but still it is not unreasonably high, and
always to be had in abundance, that is, cod, haddocks, flat
fish, great quantities of a kind of fish here called cuddies,
and, at certain seasons, myriads of a small fish here called
fellocks.  These two last, besides affording a cheap diet to
the lower classes, yield a good deal of oil from their livers,
which gives a cheap light to the manufacturers and trades
people.

   SECT. III.  Consumption of Cattle, Fish, and other Ar-
ticles.-It is not easy to ascertain, with correctness, the num-
ber of black cattle consumed annually at Thurfo, but it
runs from 200 to 300 head.  There is a very considerable
number of slaughtered sheep and swine, likewise bought and
sold in the weekly markets, but the number cannot be af-
certained with any degree of precision; and to hazard even
a guess at the quantity of fish brought to market, would be
still more precarious and uncertain.
