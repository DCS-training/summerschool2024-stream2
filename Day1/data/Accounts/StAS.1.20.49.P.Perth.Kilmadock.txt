through part of the parish of Dunblane, (where it is called
the Water of Kilbryde), joins the Teith below the castle of
Doune.
   The next in size is Kelty, which bounds the parish on
the west, and joins the Teith at Cambusmore, about a mile
east of the village of Callander.
   The other rivulet of consequence is Annat, or Cambus,
which is remarkable for its beautiful cascades, near the
house of Annat, where, by the force of the stream, in times
of stoods, it has formed a deep glen out of the solid rock.
The house of Annat stands on the brink of a grand cascade,
known by the name of the Caldron-linn, from the constant
boiling of the waters, like a seething caldron.  This burn
joins the Teith at the church of Kilmadock, rendering the
spot extremely delightful and romantic.
   Besides these, there are a number of other smaller rivu-
lets, that render the grounds pleasant as well as valuable,
affording warm retreats to the cattle in stormy weather, and
a plentiful supply of water in time of drought.

   Wild Animals and Birds.-The wild animals here, are
the same as in the neighbouring parishes, hares, rabbits,
foxes, badgers, otters, fourmarts, or polecats.  The braes on
the north-east side of Cambuswallace house have been long
a receptacle for badgers and foxes; but these mischievous
animals are now much banished.  There are great numbers
of otters to be found in the border of Lochmaghaig; and
on the sides of Uaighmor, the stag bounds along the heath.
   Partridges breed in great numbers, especially on the
north side of Teith.  All kinds of moor-fowl are to be
found on the high grounds towards Uaighmor; and Loch-
maghaig abounds with herons and wild-geese.  In the win-
ter season, the geese fly down in the morning to moss Flan-
ders, where they remain till evening, and then return to
