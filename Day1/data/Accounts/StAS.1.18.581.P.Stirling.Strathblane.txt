burst, and fell, as was evident from the effects, in entire
sheets.  The spout of Ballagan appeared as an opening,
whence the bowels of the mountain were issuing in water:
reaching the plain, the torrent burst the banks of the river on
each side, and discharged itself in nearly equal quantites to
the east and west.  That which run west, tore up every thing
before it.  Corn fields were laid waste.  Oats, barley, and
potatoes, were destroyed to a great amount.  Much damage
was done to the bleachfields below.  It carried stones of 3
tons weight a considerable way into the open field.  At one
place, it forced a passage for itself along the public road,
which it tore up like the channel of a river2. In short, it pre-
sented such a scene of devastation, as must appear incredible
to those who have not seen it.  It is computed, that there
was at least 6 times the quantity of water ever seen in the
river, during the greatest usual floods; and had it not been
for the circumstance of a part being discharged to the east, it
would have swept the houses situated on its banks before it.
It lasted 4 hours, during which time, the thunder and light-
ening were tremenduous.

   Historical Anecdotes.-The name of Rob Roy M`Gregor, a
famous Highland free-booter, is familiar to every inhabitant
of this part of Scotland.  The depredations which he and his
descendants committed are still related with wonder.  The
following copy of an order of the Justices of the Peace, met
in quarter session at Stirling, a little after the middle of last
century, will show the manner in which he held the country
under contribution.  It is taken verbatim from the original
manuscript, sent at that time to be published at the kirk of
Strathblane.
