country, which is neither adapted for agriculture, nor for
rearing black cattle, can never maintain any great number
of people comfortably.  A few villages, one perhaps in this
parish, might be of service in carrying on the fishing.  The
herrings, however, in these lochs, are a precarious support;
and it may be doubted, whether the other fisheries would
maintain a great number of men; perhaps the cottagers al-
ready in the country, are sufficiently numerous, to make the
most of the white fishing, if they carried on the business
with industry and perseverance; at any rate, if they gave it
a fair trial, it would be found, whether an accession of peo-
ple to the country would be eligible.  But in order to carry
ont he fishing with success, it would be expedient that a vil-
lage should be formed, and that the fishers should live in
one place.  The most convenient situation for a village in
this parish, seems to be near the entry into Loch-goil, this
situation being convenient for Loch-goil, Long-long, and the
Frith of Clyde.
