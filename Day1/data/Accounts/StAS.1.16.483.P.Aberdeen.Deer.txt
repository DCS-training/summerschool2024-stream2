     of Deer.

a temporal lordship in 1587, in favour of Robert Keith,
commendatary of Deer, son to William the 6th Earl Ma-
rischal.  He left no male-issue, and accordingly his estate
devolved on George Earl Marischal.
   The abbey has been an extensive building, but is now
very much in ruins.  The work has been very plain; the
doors and windows coarsely arched.  A semicircular pil-
lar of red freestone, of the Doric order, has been lately dis-
covered, close by the wall, in the inside of the north aisle
of the church.  Its diameter is 3 feet 8 inches: only 5
feet of the shaft remain.  Were more of the rubbish clear-
ed away, it is probable similar pillars might be found in
other parts of the building.
