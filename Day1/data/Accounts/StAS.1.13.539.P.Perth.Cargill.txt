parish for a great many years.  Some of the best lands are
let about L. I, 10S. the acre; those of inserior quality from
10 s. to 15 s.  A cottage and garden gives from L. 1,

   Produce.-The land here produces wheat, barley, oats,
pease, turnips, and sown grasses.  Potatoes are also raised in
confiderable quantity, and are used as food by the poorer

If the farmer could pay his rent, and live like this neigh-

seldom carried him farther.  Since the estate was restored 
to the present proprietor, the rents have been raised; a
