but a few of the more stupid and dissipated are ignorant of its
value, and allow their children to grow up without education.
Many even above the age of fifteen read very imperfectly ; twelve
adults cannot read at all.
  Literature.--A parish library was formed in 1817, which now
contains nearly 700 volumes of standard works in theology and
general literature.
  A Young Man's Society combines the double object of a Me-.
charmics' Institution and a religious meeting. On an evening of
one week, a literary paper is read, and its subject discussed. On
an evening in the succeeding week, a paper is read, and a subject
discussed for the religious improvement of the members. This
Society cnnsists of fifteen members.
  Savings' Bank.--A Savings' Bank was opened, January 6, 1832.
  Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of poor re-
ceiving parochial aid is 11. The average sum allotted to each
annually is L. 4, 10s. The collections at the church door annu-
lly, L. 30, 15s. Annual donation from Sir A. Edmonstone,
L. 5. The interest on L. 515 saved by the managers of the poor's
money, L. 12, 17s. 6d. The dissipated and improvident have no re-
luctance to ask parochial relief. The industrious, sober, and pious,
regard parochial aliment as a disgrace. When reduced to pover-
ty they are supported by the generous.
    Fair.--A fair is held on the 10th of November, for the sale of
cattle, but especially of those that are fed.
    Alehouses. --There are six alehouses in the parish. They keep
their customers in the most abject poverty, and have the most per-
nicious effect on the morals and the domestic happiness of those
who frequent them.
  Fuel.--Peats are occasionally used in a few houses: but coal
is the fuel principally employed. It is procured from Campsie,
Kirkintilloch Baldernock, and New Kilpatrick; when laid down,
costs, according to the distance, from 9s. to 15s. per ton.
