   Miscellaneous Observations.-Stirling being situated on the
isthmus, betwixt the Forth and Clyde, is, by means of its
bridge, the great thorough-fare of the north of Scotland.
There are only two inns in it which deserve the name.  There
are spacious and good.-The county meetings are usually
held in Stirling.  There is no public room, or hall for this
purpose.-Stirling is one of the seats of the Circuit Court.-
The only jail in the county is here.  The number of pri-
soners is generally not great.  For these three last years,
there have been only two criminal trials.  Petty thefts and
debt are the ordinary causes of imprisonment.-The Falkirk
district of the county, being the most populous, and no pub-
lic magistrate residing there, it uniformly furnishes the great-
est number of prisoners.-The banditti always croud to a po-
pulous placer where there is no established authority.  There
should be, in every county, a public work-house, for the con-
finement of the pilferers and sorners, who are found to be of
that county.  Banishment only increases their necessity of
stealing.
   In the council boule of Stirling is the Fugg, appointed by
law to be the standard of dry measure in Scotland, It is sta-
tuted and ordained, that the wheat firlot shall contain the full
of this jugg twenty one times and one fourth; and that the
firlot for barley, malt and oats, shall contain it 31 times.
The great number of public transactions, which have taken
place in Stirling, and in the castle, would, of themselves, fill
a volume; and, if deemed necessary to the Statistical account,
can be found in Nimmo's history, and the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, under the article STIRLING.
