		 DUNKELD AND DOWALLY.                       967

and Dowally were visited by considerable numbers of the rough-
legged buzzard, Buteo lagopus, of Fleming; but they are only oc-
casionall visitants. A beautiful specimen of the honey-buzzard,
Pernis apivorus of Cuvier, was shot here some years ago. It is
the only one we have heard of north of the Frith of Forth. The
stuffed bird is in the possession of the Right Honourable Fox
Maule, Birnam Lodge.
   The barn and tawny owl, as well as the small short-eared owl,
are very common.
   Amongst the Insessores a few of the beautiful kingfishers, Alcedo
Ispida, are to be seen by the banks of the river in the neigh-
bourhood of the town of Dunkeld. It is one of the rarest and
certainly the most highly adorned of all our birds, and yields to
few of its foreign brethren in lustrous beauty.  In winter, the
cross-bill visits this quarter in great numbers.
   Of the Rasores there are the wood-pigeon in abundance, the
pheasant, black grouse, and partridge.
   The migratory birds, both summer and winter, visit us in great
number and variety.
