     NUMBER XXXVII.

     PARISH OF BATHGATE.

     By the Rev.  Mr WALTER JARDINE.

     Situation, etc.

   THIS parish lies in the county and Presbytery of Linlith-
gow, and makes part of the Synod of Lothian and
Tweeddale.  It is 7 miles long, from east to west, and 2 miles 
broad, from north to south; being bounded by the parishes
of Torphichen, Linlithgow, Ecclesmachen, Uphall, Living-
stone, Whiteburn, and Shotts.  Towards the north-east, the
parish is high and hilly:  Bathgate hills, which are covered
with green, are a continuation of Cuckold Roy and Cairn
Naple in the parish of Linlithgow, and are some of the high-
est grounds in this part of the country.  Towards the  south-
east, south, and west, this district is flat, and almost level.

   Soil.-About the foot of Bathgate hills, the soil is good,
and tolerably dry; on the south and west sides of the town
of Bathgate, which stands on a steep slope, the ground is
bleak and wettish, but not unhealthy; nor are there any par-
ticular diseases to which the people are liable.  The soil, in
general, is pretty deep; and neither so fertile as the country
lying eastward, nor so barren as that lying to the west and 
south.
