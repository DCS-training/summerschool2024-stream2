   Proprietors and Value.-The parish belongs to the Earls
of Hopetoun and Morton, Sir William Erskine and Sir John
Henderson, Mr Cunningham and a few small heritors.  The
last gentleman is the only one of any consequence residing
in it.  The valued rent in the cess books is 6956 L. 16 s. 8 d.
Scots.  The real rent amounts to near about 3000 L. Ster-

   Appearance, Soil, and Agriculture.-The parish, in general,
excepting the Ferry hills, and a few others, is either flat or
gently rising ground, the greatest part of which is strong,
rich, or clay soil, and yields plentiful crops; even among
these hills many places are arable, and produce moderately

soil is cold, and a small part is muir.  Some of the farms are
extensive, and others of an ordinary size.  The farmers are,
in general, wealthy, industrious, and active: They improve
and cultivate their lands to great perfection and advantage:
They mostly use the new constructed ploughs, drawn by two
good horses without a driver: They manure and enrich their
field with dung, lime, and earth, mixed together, with sea
weed, when they can obtain it, and by summer fallow.  From
the goodness of the ground, and the most proper mode and
means of cultivation, they raise grain of all kinds, equal in
quantity and quality to many parts in Scotland.  The farms
are not yet all inclosed and properly fenced; but, from the
disposition of the proprietors, and the improvements now car-
rying on in that way, it is expected this will soon be the
case.  There is a society formed here, called the Farmer Club,
the members of it belong also to most of the neighbouring
parishes, and several gentlemen of landed property have
joined and patronise it.  The great object of it is to consider
and improve the different modes of agriculture.  At stated
