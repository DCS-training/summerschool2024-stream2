                 I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-The old name of this parish was Kil nam brathairn-
hill, which, in the Gaelic language, signifies a spot of ground upon
which a church or chapel was built.  During the last 250 years,
the parish has been generally known by the name of Lochgoil-head,
from Lochqoil, an arm of the sea; at the head of which the church
is situated.
   The parish of Lochgoil-head, of old, was very extensive, and
comprehended not only Kilmorich, but also the greatest part of
Kilmaglass, now called Strachur.  In the times of Popery and of
Prelacy, Lochgoil-head was an archdeanery; and not only the re-
venues of Locligoil-head itself, which were then very considerable,
but part of the tithes of several other parishes contributed to sup-
port the dignity of the arch-dean.  But after the Reformation, so
few places of worship were permitted, and these consequently so
distant from one another, and so divided by mountains, rivers, and
arms of the sea, as to render it extremely difficult, and sometimes
impossible, for the ministers to perform the duties of their office,
or for the people to attend on their instructions.  This was par-
ticularly the case in the province of Argyle.  In order to remedy
these inconveniences, an Act of Parliament passed, anno 1649,
empowering certain persons to disjoin the old, and to erect new,
parishes in that province.  In consequence of these powers, the
commissioners dismembered the old parish of Lochgoil-bead, and
formed it into three separate and independent cures.  One of
these is the present parish of Strachur ; Kilmorich was another;
and the mother church made the third, which, from its situation,
retained the old name.
