   Manures.-There is no manure used in the parish but
what each farm affords, excepting the Edinburgh dung, on
which the farmers chiefly depend for their cultivation and
their crops.  This is purchased at about 10 d. or 1 s. each
double horse-cart.  If the carriage, between 3 and 4 miles,
be estimated at 2 s. 6 d. then each cart costs about 3 s. 6 d.;
but the cost must be sometimes more, and may be some-
times less, according to the distance, and other circumstan-
ces.  The carts which bring the dung from Edinburgh
frequently carry the corn, hay, and straw from the farm to
the city, which occasions an abatement of the expence.  The
quantity of dung bestowed on an acre is usually between
30 and 40 double carts.

   Ploughgates.-The old ploughgates in the parish, when
worked by 4 horses in a plough, were 42 in number.  Last
year, the ploughgates were rated at 49: which at 12 s.
each, as charged for the statute-labour, amounted to L. 27,
5 s. Sterling.
   Where these 42 four-horse ploughs were kept, there are
now 60 two-horse ploughs employed.
   The 42 four-horse ploughs had 168 horses and 84 men.
The 60 two-horse ploughs have 120 horses and 60 men.
   The two-horse plough is one of the greatest improve-
ments that has yet taken place in the husbandry of Scot-
land.  It seems to have been introduced into this parish be-
fore the year 1770, though in the year 1771, the plough
with 4 horses was still used in many places.
   The use of the single-horse cart is but a late occurrence.
It did not take place in this parish till about the year
1780.

   Population.-Before the middle of the last century, this
parish appears to have had but few inhabitants.  Their
