party should certainly be preferred who hath the least temptation to perjury.
The woman in all ordinary cases of this kind has none: the man has a dou-
ble temptation to perjury; for first, he gets clear of the censure of the church,
and next, which to him is a matter of greater consequence, he frees himself
of the expence of the maintenance of the child.
   In the next place, it were to be wished, that the gentlemen in Scot!and, be-
fore it be too late, would voluntarily give less or more for supporting the kirk-
sessions, and enabling them to maintain the poor; for should kirk-sessions give
up their laborious and painful talk, the gentry, who now give next to no-
thing, if they once came to be taxed by law for the maintenance of the poor,
will find their rate operate pretty much in the same way as an heritable bond
of the same extent, upon their lands.  If every heritor, resident, and non-re-
sident, were to give in as much to the kirk-session, as it may reasonably be
supposed, his tenants and their families in that parish give, which may be 2 d.
or 3 d. each Sunday, even that small help would keep the poor from begging or
starving.  Suppose the heritor has six tenants, it certainly would not be an
excess of generosity to give at the rate of a shilling each Sunday for the support
of the poor.  The expence of maintaining the poor in England is well known.
