     NUMBER XX.

     PARISH OF BELHELVIE.

     (County of Aberdeen.-Presbytery and Synod of Aber-
     deen.)

     By the Reverend Mr ALEXANDER JOHN FORSYTH.

     Situation.

   THIS parish is situated in that division of the county of
Aberdeen called Formartin, which division includes all
the lands on the sea coast between the rivers Don and Ythan.

   Appearance and Soil.-To a stranger who travels on either
of the two principal roads in this parish, the appearance of
the ground is very unfavourable, as he will see little but
heath and stones; notwithstanding which, this parish, parti-
cularly on the sea coast, contains many acres of naturally very
fertile land, and capable of producing heavy crops of wheat,
being a rich loam and clay.  However, there is but little
wheat sown, owing to improvements here being in their in-
fancy, and to the difficulty of disposing of it, from the bakers
in Aberdeen obstinately preferring English flour (though of-
ten not so good) to the flour of wheat produced in their own
country.  Besides a small quantity of wheat and flax, this
parish produces great crops of oats, bear, turnip, potatoes,
etc.  The grain does much more than supply the inhabitants,
and the overplus is sent to the Aberdeen market.
