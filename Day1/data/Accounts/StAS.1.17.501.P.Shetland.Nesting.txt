na, third Sabbath, Whalsay; and, in the summer, he visits
the detached islands of Skerries, for a week in the year.

   Agriculture.-The agriculture in this ministry is in the
same wretched state that it is in all the Shetland islands.
The people direct their sole attention to the fishing, and con-
sider the cultivation of the lands as only a secondary object.

   Shipwrecks.-On the coasts of this extensive ministry ship-
wrecks often happen; and it ought to be mentioned, to the cre-
dit of the inhabitants, that the poor sufferers have, on all oc-
casions, been treated with the greatest humanity.  One in-
stance only, out of many that might be adduced, shall here
be mentioned.  In the year 1780, a Russian frigate was
wrecked on the island of Whalsay.  Mr Bruce Stewart, the
proprietor of that island, ordered immediately his tenants to
fit out proper boats to save what lives could be saved.  Un-
fortunately all their exertions, which were made at the risk
of their own lives, could save only five of the Russian sailors.
These five men were entertained by Mr Bruce at his hospi-
table mansion for several months, and sent home to their na-
tive country.  From the report of these five men, the Em-
press of Russia gave orders to her ambassador at the Court
of London, to write, in her name, a letter of thanks to Mr
Bruce of Symbister; which letter I have seen.  It does ho-
nour to her, as a Sovereign who deigns to interest herself in
the kindness shown to her subjects in distress.  Many more
instances might be mentioned of the humanity shown by the
inhabitants of this parish to sailors in distress.  Unfortunate-
ly, they have too many calls on their humanity in this way.

   Means of Improvement.-One observation applies to this mi-
nistry, as well as to all the other parishes in Shetland Islands,
