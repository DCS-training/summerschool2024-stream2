				UNITED PARISHES OF

 			      ABOYNE AND GLENTANNER.

		PRESBYTERY OF KINCARDINE O'NEIL, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

			THE REV. ROBERT MILNE MILLER, MINISTER.

                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
         Name.-ABOYNE is compounded of the Gaelic words, A, a ford,
and boinne or buinne, a current of rippling water; a name very
descriptive of a ford in the Dee, a little south of the church.
Glentanner is compounded of the Gaelic words Glean-tan-ar,
signifying the glen of Scanty arable land. The two parishes being
now united are generally known by the name of Aboyne.
       Boundaries and Extent.-The united parish, on the west and
left bank of the Dee, is bounded by Tullich, and on the right
bank by Glenmuick; on the south, by Lochlee and Birse; on
the east, by Kincardine O'Neil; and on the north, by Lumphan-
an, Coull, and Logie-Coldstone; the boundary line being gene-
rally formed by mountain-crests, the river Dee, or some of its
tributary streams. A detached part, containing a population of
about 60, is situated on the left bank of the Feugh, not far from
the north base of Clach-na-bein, and about nine miles south-east
from the church.  Between this detached part and the church, al-
most the whole of Birse intervenes. The form of the parish is
very irregular. Its length from east to west may be 13 miles,
and its breadth from north to south, 12 miles. These, how-
ever, are taken from extreme points; and its whole area may
be calculated at 37,000 imperial acres. Glentanner is on the
right bank of the Dee, bounded on the north by that river, and
