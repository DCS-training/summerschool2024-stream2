   Stipend, Schools, Poor, etc.-The Earl of Hopetoon is
patron of both the parishes of Hutton and Corrie.  They
were united, it is supposed, soon after the Reformation.
There are now no traces of a place of worship at Corrie,
exepting the burying-ground, which is well fence.  The
church of Hutton was built in 1764, and the manse in 1755.
They have had often small repairs since then.  The mini-
ster's stipend, including allowance for communion elements,
is 1300 merks, or L. 72 : 4 : 5 4/13.  The glebe is extensive,
and worth about L. 12 yearly.-The parish of Corrie in
1727 had L. 280 Sterling left to it by Mr Edward Moffat
of Exeter, a native of the parish, for paying a schoolmaster.
The heritors have granted him a house and small glebe,
and the inhabitants have been fortunate is having good
teachers.  The heritors of Hutton give a voluntary salary
of L. 8 : 6 : 8 to a separate schoolmaster; and their school
has also been generally well supplied.  The parishioners
think they have been the better, so that the teacher was
removable at will.  But it is not meant to infer that this
would be proper or just as a general practice.  If it were, the
employment of schoolmaster, at all times poor, would in
old age be dependent also.-The poor of the parish have
not been very many.  Their fund of money at interest has
been small, and is at present none; but the aged and fallen
back tenants and cottagers have been well attended to by the
chief heritors of the parish, by providing them generally
with houses, some of them with a cow's grass, and an acre
or two of land, and giving them temporary aids in money.
This has been done at an expense not exceeding L. 25
yearly; and there has not been a beggar in the parish for
many years.

   Character of the People.-The people of these parishes
have been at all times regular in their conduct, and well
