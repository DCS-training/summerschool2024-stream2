			PARISH OF MARYTOWN.

		PRESBYTERY OF BRECHIN, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

    		  THE REV. ANDREW FERGUSSON, MINISTER.

	           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, Boundaries, &c.--THE, name of Marytown was probably
given to this parish in honour of the Virgin Mary,--a well on the
border of the parish still retaining the name of Marywell. The
parish is bounded by the river South Esk, and the basin (commonly
called the back sands,) of Montrose on the north; by the parish
of Craig on the east; by the sea and the parish of Lunan on the
south; and by the parish of Farnell on the west.
   Its extent from e`st to west is about a mile and a-half; and from
north to south three miles.
   Topographical Appearances.--A small ridge of hills run through
it from east to west, dividing it into two estates,--Old Montrose
and Dysart. The sea coast, which forms the boundary of the latter,
consists of very high rocks, which afford shelter to a variety of sea
fowl. Marytown Law, which forms a part of that ridge, is a con-
siderable eminence founded on a rock 300 or 400 feet above the
level of the sea. It is evidently artificial, and probably in old times
was either an alarm-post, as it commands a very extensive view,
both of sea and land; or a place where the great family of Mon-
trose administered justice to its vassals. The top of it affords
one of the most beautiful prospects in Scotland. To the north,
close under the eye, is the rich and fertile strath extending from
Brechin to Montrose, marked with the windings, of the river South
Esk, and with a number of elegant country seats; there is also a fine
view of both these towns, with the basin and harbour of Montrose;
and in the back ground are the Grampian mountains, and part of
the adjoining county of Kincardine. To the east and south lies the
well cultivated parish of Craig, adorned with several gentlemen's
seats, and the prospect is terminated by an extensive view of the
German Ocean.
