Abbey, with that part of the town which lies on the south of
this rivulet, falls within the county of Forfar.  The rest of
the town and parish are in the county of Perth.  The streets
are paved, and have lately been provided with lamps.  The
town has received considerable ornament, as well as advan-
tage, from the excellent turnpike roads that have just been
finished.  The Perth road, from the west, falls upon the cross
in a direct line of about a mile; with this the Dundee road,
from the south, forms a right angle; and, when the latter is
carried directly through the town, to the east, as is in con-

have lately been built here.  The steeple was built in 1762,
on the spot where the prison of the court of regality stood.
The view from the Beach Hill, northward of the town, is sin-

river Isla, in its course through a fertile and extensive plain;
and, on the other side, a champaign open country, variegated
with thriving villages and fruitful fields.  There is a weekly
market on Thursday, and fairs in April, May, July, and De-
cember.  Conpar is supposed to have tripled the number of
its inhabitants within the last half century.  This increase is
chiefly owing to the encouragement given to the manufac-
turing of linen in this part of the country, and partly to the
monopolising of farms, by which small tenants and trades
people have been obliged to remove to manufacturing towns.

   Villages, Mills, etc.-Next to Coupar, the greatest villages
are Balbrogie, Wellton, and Cadam; and the number of fami-
lies in the largest of these does not exceed 35.  There is scarce-
