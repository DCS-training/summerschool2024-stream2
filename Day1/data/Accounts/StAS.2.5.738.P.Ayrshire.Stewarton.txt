north side in 1825, and now accommodates 1800 sitters, including
two aisles belonging to Mr Cuninghame of Lainshaw, the patron,
and Sir A. D. M. Cuninghame of Corsehill, Bart., which contain
nearly 300 sitters. It is any thing but neat and comfortable, though
kept in repair, and well lighted with gas. The glebe consists of
four acres Scotch, and is worth about L. 12 a-year. The stipend
was augmented in 1835, and is eighteen chalders, half-meal, half-
barley, with L. 15 for communion elements. Average amount for
the last five years, L. 280. The unexhausted teinds amount to
L. 291 at least, as stated in the third report of the Commission-
ers for Religious Instruction. The congregation here of the As-
sociate Synod of original Seceders lately united itself with the
Church of Scotland, and has since built a new church containing
accommodation for 800 sitters. It has a handsome spire, 80 feet
in height; which, as it is situated near the centre of the town,
on rising ground, forms an object of attraction and ornament to
the town. A missionary has in the meantime been appointed by
the Presbytery of Irvine, but has not been ordained to the charge,
in consequence of a process raised before the Court of Session
against the Presbytery for making a quoad sacra division of the
parish, and for allowing the minister of this congregation a seat and
a vote in the Presbytery. The United Secession congregation pay
their minister L. 100 a-year; besides, he has a house and a small
garden. This church was built in 1775, and holds 510 sitters.
A congregational church has been in existence since February
1827, and holds about 400 sitters. The two last named Congre-
gations support their own poor, besides contributing liberally to
other religious purposes. The number of individuals belonging
to the respective places of worship will be seen from the following
abstract laid before the Commissioners for Religious Instruction,
in November 1836:
