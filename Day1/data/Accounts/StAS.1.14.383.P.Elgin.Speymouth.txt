answer well.  Oats are sown in the month of April;
pease about the same time; rye after harvest, or in
March.  The produce, at an average, will not be above
4 bolls the acre.  The parish will supply itself for com-
mon.  The plough generally used is of the small kind,
here called the English plough.  In some of the stronger
grounds, they use the Scotch plough, somewhat less and
lighter than of old; and this, when properly construct-
ed, is perhaps the best form of any, in every kind of
soil.
   The number of horses in the parish will be about
194; of black cattle about 636; of sheep about 2000;
of swine or hogs about 40.  The better sort of farmers
keep horses of a good size, 2 of which are able to draw
a plough; but the generality of the horses are of a
smaller size, but strong and hardy.  The cattle are ge-
nerally of a small size; such as when fed for the butcher,
will weigh from 20 to 22 a stone.  A mixture of the
Highland breed is now generally preferred and adopted
all over this country, as being the handsomest and most
hardy.  The sheep are generally of a very small kind.
Some time ago, the Linton breed was fought after, as
being of a larger size.  But their wool was found to be
much coarser, and they were not found to thrive so well
with our pasture, as the old native breed of the coun-

native breed is therefore now preferred here, and almost
all over Murray.  Their wool is of the finest quality,
approaching, it is said, to the Cheviot and Shetland wool.
They will generally weigh, when fed for the butcher,
about 7 or 8 lb. the quarter.  The better sort of farm-
ers use ploughs drawn by 2 stout horses.  Some few use
6 or 8 oxen in the plough.  But the most common
