tenants, such as rent only an half, a fourth or an eighth of a farm.  Amongcottagers, are included, not only day-labourers, but all servants, who, ha-
ving families, receive livery meal for their board.  There are few men in 
the parish who have not, at one time or other, served in the bounty fishing
vessels; and by bounty-fishers, is meant, such as were in that employ this
season.  By Clyde fishes is to be understood, the crews or such boats as
pursue the fishing in the srith of Clyde, and lochs adjoining, during the
season; and, by Caolisport and Knap fishers, such as attend to it to longer
that while the herrings continue in Loch-caolisport.
