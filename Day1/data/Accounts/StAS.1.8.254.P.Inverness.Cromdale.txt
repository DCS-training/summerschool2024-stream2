their arable ground, to pass without the least molestation.

   Animals.-The white hare is frequently got in this parish
during winter.  It is as white as snow, and the ears are

very numerous.  Horses used for work, were, some years
ago, generally bred in the country; but now, owing to the
stocks of sheep, which consume the growth of the common

fed upon pure heath; and the connoisseurs in mutton attribute

which Sir James Grant of Grant is the role proprietor and
patron, is considerably beyond 2000 L. a-year.  CASTLE

which ascertain their residence there for upwards of 500 years,
without any failure in the male line all that time; and though
they have had the property of the whole parish, for about 200
years; yet prior to this, it was divided among different heri-
