     Statistical Account

good anchoring ground at both ends, and at Urquhart
Bay, Alt Say, and Port Clair, on the north side; and Inver-
sarigach and Foyers on the south.  There is also a safe creek
at the Horse Shoe.

   The lake never freezes, which is supposed to be owing to
its great depth, and sulphureous bottom; and the high hills,
with which it is inclosed on the south and north, present to
one sailing on the lake, a pleasant view of wood, pasture, rivers
and rivulets, corn fields, broken steeps, and irregular preci-
pices.  In this large of water there are many trouts of
3 or 4 pounds weight, and some salmon, which pass the
crulves in the river Ness, when it is high.  There is no re-
gular salmon fishing on the lake, as the expence of fishing,
on an average, exceeded the profits.  Fort Augustus, which
lies at the farther extremity of the lake, is well situated for
an woollen manufacture, as it is in the mouth of the High-
lands, where many, who were distressed by the extention of
sheep farms, still continue to reside, from an invincible at-
tachment to their native country, though they have scarce
sufficient employment to maintain them.  There are several
other lakes, besides Lochness, in this parish, which abound
with small trout; but the inhabitants near them fish more for
their amusement than for subsistence, and never for sale.  It
is remarkable, that one of these lakes never freezes in winter
but frequently does in spring.

   Wood and Animals.-There are several extensive sir plan-
tations in the parish, which are in a thriving condition, and
conveniently situated for the market.-Besides the common
animals for domestic use, there are deer, roes, badgers,
foxes, hares, pole-cats, wild-cats, and weasels.
