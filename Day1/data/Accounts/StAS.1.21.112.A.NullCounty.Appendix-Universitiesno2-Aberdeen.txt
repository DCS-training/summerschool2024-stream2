and unites both Universities into one in all time coming, to be
called, THE CAROLINE UNIVERSITY; with this provision,
that both shall enjoy and exercise all their primitive powers,
privileges, and particular jurisdiction, which they had held
and exercised before the laid union took place.  The two
Colleges acquiesced in this union and erection, which was
confirmed by an Act of Parliament of the same month and
year.  They accordingly enjoyed the conjunct possession of
the bishop's rents for several years, and also of another dona-
tion afterwards granted by the protector Cromwell, in favour
of the University of Aberdeen, and two Colleges thereof;
They chose a common rector by turns, not judging it neces-
sary or expedient to elect any superior magistrate, and sub-
mitted to Commissions of visitation under the great seal, ad-
dressed to the principals, professors, and masters of the Uni-
versity of Aberdeen.  But Charles II. having restored Episco-
pacy in Scotland in 1661, the alienated rents of the bishop-
rics were resumed, and at the same time the bishop of Aber-
deen, now reinstated in his office, and chancellor, ex dignitate,
of the old College, laying claim to the same jurisdiction over
the other, the Principal and masters maintained the privilege
referred to them by the charter of union, and refused to sub-
mit to any chancellor not elected by themselves.  From this
period, therefore, the Act of Parliament, confirming the
union of the two Universities, being understood to be re-
scinded, along with the other acts of King Charles I. from
the year 1637, the members of this University have elected
and been governed by their own proper magistrate, and have
had little public connexion or intercourse with that of Old
Aberdeen.
