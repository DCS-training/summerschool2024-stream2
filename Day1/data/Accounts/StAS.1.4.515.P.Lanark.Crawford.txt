said to be Roman, but even the vestiges are greatly defaced.
There are, however, evident marks of what was the state
of the country in general about 200 years ago.  Tower
Lindsay, which is adjacent to the village on the other side
of the Clyde, was, no doubt, a fortified place.  The present
castle scarcely deserves the name; but the ancient tower
was famous even in the days of Wallace.  There is a tra-
dition, that it was stormed by that hero, and 50 English-
men killed in it.  It now lies in the form of a large heap
of earth, all over green.  The houses on the farms in the
moor were formerly stone-vaults, some of which remain.
These are still pointed to as the strong holds where the in-
habitants preserved themselves and their property, at the
time when the Douglasses of Clydesdale, and the Jardines
and Johnstones of Annandale, were carrying on their hosti-
lities and depredations.-There are hills in the parish, call-
ed watches, where persons sat in order to give notice on
the first approach of an enemy.  These notices were com-
municated almost instantaneously, from the head of the pa-
rish to the lower end, by smoke in the day, and the flame in
the night.-Queen Elizabeth, who had the direction of af-
fairs in this country during the captivity of the unfortunate
Mary, sent down a German to gather gold dust in the wa-
ters of Elvan and Glengonar, both which have their sources
in the hills where the lead is found.  This man wrote an
account of his discoveries and labours, the manuscript of
which is in the Advocate's library.  The place where he
washed the gold, took its name from the event, and is call-
ed the Gold Scour.  There are verses still repeated in the
parish, importing that he made a great fortune.  Be that
as it will, the business was resumed by order of the late
Earl of Hopetoun, and, in a little time, discontinued again,
as being less profitable than common labour.  Gold dust
