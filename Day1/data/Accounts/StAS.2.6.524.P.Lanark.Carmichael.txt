From the improvements which he completed upon his estates, both
in this and the adjoining parishes, and from plans which he con-

have possed very enlarged and comprehensive views. They were
in advance of the age in which he lived, and the plans which he
formed and completed, exhausted more than the rental of his
estates. There were enclosed and subdiided about 1200 Scoth
acres, and the stone and earthen fences were said to measure thirty-
five miles. The inclosure, of various dimension, were surround-
ed by belts of plantation, and ornamented, according to the estate
of that time, with clumps of trees of different sorts. Though now
much thinned by the ravages of time, and the axe of the forester,
there is still a sufficient remainder to attest the correct design and
planted by his successors, and by which the beauty and value of
the estate have been greatly increased.
