     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH OF ANCRUM.

     (Presbytery of Jedburgh.-Synod of Merse and Ti-
     viotdale.-County of Roxburgh.)

     By the Reverend THOMAS SOMERVILLE, D. D. Minister
     of Jedburgh.

     Extent and Name.

   THE parish of Ancrum, situated nearly in the center of
the county of Roxburgh, stretches 5 miles in length
upon the N. side of the river Tiviot, which divides it from
the parishes of Jedburgh and Bedrule.  The extreme length
of this district is not less than 6 miles, and its breadth does
not exceed 4.-The name of the village, Alncromb, as it Is
written in ancient, records*, signifies, as I have been inform-
ed, in the Gaelic, crook upon river; and is exactly descrip-
tive of its situation on the south side of Ale, where the river
runs in a curve or crooked direction, and the adjacent banks,
to which the village approaches, exhibit the side of an ellip-
sis.  The parish of Langnewton was annexed to that of An-
crum in the end of the last century, and forms the N. W.
and part of the N. side of the parish, as now described.  The
river Ale, issuing from the loch of that name in the county
of Selkirk, takes its course through this parish from W. to
E. separating, as I conjecture, the old parish of Langnewton;
