ried a load to them but two, but died in the butts, louping
to death, so that every body said that he was witched.

     October 29th.

19. Euphen Boswell being sworn, deported, that her gud-
man being to sail to the East country, loaden with
salt, the said Alison Dick having born some of the
salt aboard, she came to her and craved money from
her, who gave her meat; but would give her no mo-
ney, saying to her, Alison, my gudman has paid you
himself, and therefore, I will give you nothing.  She
replied, Will ye give me nothing?  I hope in God, it
will be better sharp (cheaper) sold nor it was bought:
and so it sell out; for the ship failed upon the morn;
and the day after that, she sank, salt and all, except
the men, who were saved by another ship that was near
by them.
20. Thomas Mustard being sworn, deponed, that James
Wilson going once to sail, Alison Dick came to him, and
desyred silver from him, he would give her none; she
abused him with language, and he struck her; she said to
him, that that hand should do him little good that voyage:
and within two days after, his hand swelled as great as a
pint-stoup, so that he could get little or nothing done with
it.  The next time also when he was to sail, the said
Alison went betwixt him and the boat; and he said, Yon
same witch thief is going betwixt me and the boat; I
must have blood of her: and he went and struck her, and
bled her, and she cursed him and banned him; and that
same voyage, he being in Caithness, standing upon the
shore, cleithing a tow, and a boy with him, the sea came
and took him away, and he died; and the boy was well
enough.
