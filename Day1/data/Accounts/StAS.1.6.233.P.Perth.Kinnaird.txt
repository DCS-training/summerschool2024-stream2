     NUMBER XXVIII.

     PARISH OF KINNAIRD.

     (PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND
     MEARNS, COUNTY OF PERTH.)

     By the Rev. Mr. DAVID SPENCE.

     Name and Extent.

   THE name of the parish is compounded of two Celtic
words, which signify high end or head.  It may have
got this name (as most Celtic names of places are descriptive)
from the raised situation of the village, or castle of Kinnaird,
which stands higher than the village, a little on the north side
of it; and commands an extensive and beautiful prospect to
the S. of the Carse of Gowrie, bounded by the river Tay, and
the north hills of Fife.-The barony lands of Kinnaird belong-
ed originally to the noble family of that name, by a grant from
one of the kings of Scotland; and from them they derived
their name and title, though no part is now in their posses-
sion.-The castle bears the marks of considerable antiquity;
and is said by the country people to be between 500 and 600
years old.  Great part of it appears to be entirely demolished;
but so much remains as shews that it has been designed for de-
fence; and was formerly a place of very considerable strength,
