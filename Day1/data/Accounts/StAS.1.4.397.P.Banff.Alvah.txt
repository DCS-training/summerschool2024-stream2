the year 1720, the ancient state of its population cannot be
ascertained.  From the records since that period, it should
seem that population is upon the decline.

   The marriages are restricted to those where the husband
was a residenter; from the idea, that girls married out of
the parish do not contribute to its population:  But left
this should be deemed erroneous, it may be proper to
notify, that the average of all, who were married during
the first period, was 7 1/7; during the second, 9 3/7; and du-
ring the third, 9 4/7.  In the year 1782, the number of pa-
rishioners, on an exact survey, was found to amount to
1070; which is very nearly the present state of it.  Some
years before it was rather greater.  One principal cause
of depopulation in this parish is, the eagerness of some im-
provers to take all their land under their own manage-

ers are deprived of their crofts; and, as there are no vil-
lages within the parish, betake themselves to other places,
where they can find accommodation.  Why the same
number of marriages doth not produce an equal number
of birhts as in former times, is left to more intelligent
heads to explain?  There have been no extraordinary in-
