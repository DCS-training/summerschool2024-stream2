                 PARISH OF KEITHHALL AND KINKELL.

            PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                 THE REV. JOHN KEITH, MINISTER.

                 I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-KEITHHALL became the name of the parish after the
greater part of it was possessed by Keith, the Earl Marischal of
Scotland.  It was anciently called Montkeggie.  Kinkell was a
parsonage of seven parishes, and retains the ancient name, which
signifies the head or principal church.  The annexation was in
1754.
   Extent.-The lenght of the parish is about 5 miles, and the
breadth is rather less, but verey unequal.  It contains 11 1/2 square
miles.
   Boundaries.-The rivers Don and Ury form the boundary with
Kintore and Inverury.  The parish adjoins Chapel of Garioch,
Bourty, Udny, New Machar, and Fintry.  The figure is irre-
gular.
   The best land is either loam or alluvial.  Very little of it ex-
ceeds two feet in depth.  The inferior consist of almost evry
variety, with the exception of marl.  There is no less diversity in
the subsoil.  The worst is a hardened mixture of gravel and clay.
   The plantations are of beech, elm, ash oak, plane, Scotch fir,
and pine.  The larch and oak do not grow freely.  The others
are of considerable size in the policies of Keithhall, the seat of
the Earl of Kintore.  At Balbithan, there is a very large beech,
remarkable for its straight and branches trunk, which is 24 feet
high, with only two branches at 30 feet.  Seven boughs rise from
it, each 2 1/2 feet in diameter, to an altitude of 50 feet; and the
alteral extent of some is not much less.

                           II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Eminent Men.-Caskieben, the ancient name of the estate of
Keithall, was the birth-place of the distinguished acholar, Arthur
Johnson.  He was born in 1587, and died at the age of fifty-four.
