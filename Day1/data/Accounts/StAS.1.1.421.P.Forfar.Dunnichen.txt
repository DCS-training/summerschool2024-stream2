     of Dunnichen.

Rivers, etc.-This Parish contains no river nor lake.  It
is watered by one small brook, called Vinny, some say Finny,
or Attle, which takes its rise in a neighbouring moss.  It
runs from west to east, along the south base of the hill of
Dunnichen, and in its course turns one flax mill, and one 
mill for washing yarn.  It joins Lunan water about 4 miles
below.  The burn of Craichy, which forms one of its four-
ces, turns a corn mill.  It contains some trout, much dimi-
nished of late in thier number, by flax being steeped in and
near its stream.  A small brook runs out of the moss of
Dunnichen, and falls into Vinny at the eastern extremity of
the parish.

   Manufactures, Villages, and Fairs.-Many weavers, princi-
pally of course linen, inhabit this parish.  An attempt is now
making to introduce the manufacture of coarse cottons.  Dun-
nichen is itself a very small village, consisting of the houses of
the proprietor, the manse, a public house, and the house of 
a few mechanics and labourers, not exceeding 14 in all.  To
the eastward is the village of Drimmitormont, a very old vil-
lage, inhabited by weavers, each of whom occupy six or eight
acres of land.  In the year 1788, a farm of 66 acres, called
Letham, has been laid out by the proprietor of Dunnichen
for a village.  Streets have been marked out on a regular
plan, and lots of any extent are let upon perpetual leases, at
the rate of L. 2 an acre.  It contains already about 20 families,
and new houses are rising on it daily, the situation being fa-
vourable for such plan, by having Vinny water on the south,
the perennial brook of Dunnichen moss running through it,
plenty of freestones on the farm itself, and thriving woods
and a moss in its neighbourhood.  Here a fair or market has
lately begun to be held, once a fortnight, on Thursdays, for
the sale of cloth, yarn, and flax; and L. 400 or L. 500 are
