          	ON THE COUNTY OF STIRLING.                    453

   The Civil History of this shire forms a portion of the history of
Scotland, and is so intimately connected with it, that it would be
almost superfluous to treat of it in a local Account such as this.
The position of Stirling Castle, amidst extensive marshes, and
near to the banks of the river Forth, put it into so peculiar a po-
sition, that it became, in a great measure, the key between the
north and south of Scotland; and it became difficult for moving
armies to pass from the one to the other, without approaching this
the most noted of Scotland's battle-fields. It was not, however,
till the time of the Stewarts, that Stirling became a royal resi-
dence, and it is from that period, that its history assumes a truly
national character.
   The Agriculture, the nature of the soil, and the various pro-
ducts which it yields, are very fully detailed in the Accounts of the
parishes themselves.
The county is divided into 25 parishes. The valued rent in
1674 was L.108,509 Scots. The annual value of real property,
as assessed in 1815, was L.218,761 Sterling. The population in
1831 was 72,621; the inhabited houses, 10,450; the families,
15,351. The Parliamentary constituency in 1839 was 2320. The
only royal burgh in the county is Stirling, situated about 25 miles
north-west of Edinburgh. Thereare, however, several towns and
villages of considerable consequence in it, such as Falkirk, St Ni-
nians, Larbert, Kippen, Kilsytb, Airtb, Bucblyvie, Campsie, and
Killearn. The county of Stirling is watered by the Forth, the
Teith and the Carron, besides several smaller streams.
