the 15th century, by one of the Earls of Tullibardine.  In 
the choir of this chapel the Dukes of Athol formerly buried 
their dead.  Besides these, there are the vestiges of two
chapels in the ground of Mahany, at one of which there is 
still a burying ground, used by the people in the neighbour-

of the Earls of Tullibardine; and for a long time after
that family came to the titles of Athol, by marry-
