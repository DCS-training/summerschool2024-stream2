than what they have formerly done.  The parish supplies
itself with provisions.  It always spares a considerable quan-
tity of meal and some bear, part of which is sold to the
people that live near the head of the rivers Dee and Don,
and the rest carried to Aberdeen.  To that market, too , are
annually sent a good many sat sheep.  The dealers in black
cattle carry, every year, from this and the neighbouring pa-
rishes, to the markets in the south of Scotland, a considerable
number of cattle and cows, where they are brought up for
English pasture and English markets.  A lint-mill has been
lately erected in this parish; and the farmers begin to
raise some flax, but chiesly as yet for their own use.  There

nerally sown from the middle of March to the middle of A-
pril; and when the barley ground is clean, the sooner it is

bout the first of September.  In 1782, though the crop was
much hurt, there was within the parish as mucg wholesome
seed, as would serve itself, and give some aid to their neigh-
bours; and though the meal was less in quantity, and a con-
siderable part of it much worse in quality than usual, the
farmers were still able to spare as much as helped to pay their
rents.  A good deal of pains was taken, though without
much succes, to fix, if possible, on some decisive marks by
which the good seed might be distiguished from such as was
hurt by frost.  Experience taught, that ni fress at all was
to be laid on the appearance of the gain in its natural
state.  The clearest and best looking part of it, when sowed
often produced the worst crop.  The grain too, that yielded,
when milled, the greatest quantity of meal was far from ha-
