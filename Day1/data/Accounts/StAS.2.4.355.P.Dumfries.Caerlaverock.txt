sold. About L. 40 yearly may be received from the sale of white
fish, of which flounders are the chief.
	Produce.--It is not easy to give an accurate account of farm pro-
duce. The produce of the land in corn and cattle way be esti-
mated as being upon the whole equal at least to that of arable land
in Scotland on an average. The rearing of pigs in this and the
neighbouring parishes is carried to a greater extent than common;
--almost every cottar keeps a pig, which enables him to pay his
rent, and also furnishes him with manure for potatoes.

	Manufactures.--There are no manufactures in this parish.
Ship-building, however, is carried on to a small extent; and two
vessels of about sixty tons burden may be annually launched.
	Navigation.--For an account of the navigation the reader is re-
ferred to the statistics of Dumfries,--as Glencaple quay can only
be considered a subsidiary port to that of Dumfries. Vessels
bound for Dumfries, but unable from their burden to reach the
place of their destination, here unload,--which furnishes employ-
ment for a number of carriers.

<FOOTNOTE>This is not the return of the periodical thinnings, but is calculated from what
the plantations may be supposed to yield in the course of thirty years.
