by the winter storms, suffers most.  From the same cause,
an early vegetation arises, which is denied to the northern
exposure, and, from its succulence, furnishes substenance to
the dam to support her tender brood.

   Soil, etc.-In the course of ages, the decomposing power
of the atmosphere, and the decay of vegetable substance,
have formed the greater part of the soil.  The common
whinstone, and other schistic rocks, have formed the basis
of the greater part of the superstratum, which contains a
considerable proportion of clay, as may be supposed, be-
cause formed from that class of rocks.  The subsidence
from the Tweed and Leithen has formed the least, but most
fertile soil.  This being subject to inundation, is not so fully
under the power of the farmer as the hanging plains above
either.  In these, springs bursting through the fissures of
the rocks, known by the name of blind springs, and large
stones fixed in the earth, were unsurmountable difficulties
to the inexperienced farmer of former times: now,
though agriculture is here only in its infancy, the active
and intelligent know how to overcome both, with prodi-
gious advantage to themselves.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The climate, in such an exten-
sive hilly district, must be various; the air, however, is
dry and healthy.  The banks of the Tweed have an early
harvest, both from the sharpness of the soil, and the genial
exposure.  The lowest part of the parish was subject to an
annual visit of the ague about 20 years ago; but whether
from the drainage of the land or from the better agricul-
ture of that particular part of the parish, it has for some
time past entirely disappeared.  No epidemical disease af-
flicts the inhabitants at present.  Rheumatism, caused by
bad and damp houses, and low living, in general afflicts
