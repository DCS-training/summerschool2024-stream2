   Coast, Fisheries, etc.-The extent of coast is about 13
miles.  The shore is in some places flat and sandy, but
in general rocky and low.  The fish commonly caught
are herring, cod, mackerel, skate, slounders and salmon.
Salmon are sold from 1 d. to 3 d. a-pound.  The other fish
are sold by guess or number, according to their size.  The
salmon and herrings are caught with nets; the other fish
with lines.  Greenock and Glasgow are the markets in
which the fish caught here are generally sold.  There is a
strong current in the Gairloch, between the parishes of Rose-
neath and Row, opposite to the church of Row, where there
is a ferry.  There are two bays on the coast, one called Call-
wattie, and the other Campsoil; in which last there is good
anchorage, and safe harbour for ships of any burden.  In
the Duke of Argyle's park there is a remarkable rock,
which, bears evident marks of having been washed by the
sea.  Its greatest perpendicular height is 34 feet.  It is
called Wallace's Loup, i.e.  Leap, from a tradition, that the
renowned Wallace, being closely pursued by a party of his
enemies, jumped down this rock on horseback, and escaped
unhurt; but his horse was killed by the fall, and was bu-
ried at the foot of the rock, where his grave is shewn.

   Produce, Rent, etc.-The average produce of an acre is not
easily estimated, both from the farmers being backward in
disclosing their affairs, and from a want of knowing the
number of acres in the parish.  The parish could sufficient-
ly supply its inhabitants with provisions, if they were not
obliged to sell the produce for ready money, in order to
pay their rents:  When this is the case, they are under the
necessity of buying provisions again for their own support;
the purchase-money for which arises from the profits of
the herring-fishery.  The land-rent of the parish is about
