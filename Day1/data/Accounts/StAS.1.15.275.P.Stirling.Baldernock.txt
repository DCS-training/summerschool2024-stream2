people.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valuation of the parish is 1744 L.
Scots.  It is not easy to ascertain the real rent, because a
number of the proprietors cultivate their own ground; but
it is supposed that it will not be over-rated at 3000 L. Ster-
ling.  Arable land is rented from 10 s. to 2 L. per acre: and
besides their rent to the landlord, the tenants are generally
bound by their tacks to pay all the public burdens upon the
lands they possess.  Most of their farms are also thirled to
a particular mill, and pay, some of them so high as the 16th
or 17th part of all the grain which they have occasion to
grind; a discouragement to industry now altogether unne-
cessary, and which every landholder, who wishes to advance
the value of his property, by encouraging the industry of his
tenants, ought if possible to remove.

   Mode of Cultivation.-The farms are in general small, in-
closed and subdivided; and the present race of farmers are
supposed to surpass their fathers in skill and industry.  Clear-
ing the ground of stones, draining, levelling the inequalities
of the surface, straightening the ridges, laying on lime, and
guarding against the common mistake of overcropping, may
be esteemed the chief improvements.  The Scotch plough,
drawn by 3, and sometimes by 4 horses, is that in most com-
mon use.  Oats and barley are the kinds of grain chiefly cultiva-
ted.  The plough goes little before the beginning of March;
and the farmers seem not anxious to have the sowing of oats fi-
nished before the end of April, and the barley before the 20th
of May.  After liming their ground, they generally take two
