   Minerals.-It is said, that there are symptoms of lead in
Glenwhurry Cleugh, Bankhead-hill, and the other hills to-

tioned, whether in any age or nation there has ever before oc-
curred any thing like it.  It is true, indeed, every kind of manu-
facture is in so far valuable, as it contributes to the extension of
commerce.  produces the conveniencies of live, furnishes employ-
ment to the labouring poor, and bids fair to be permanent;
but it is rather unfortunate, when one sort happens to interfere
with the interest of another; still more, when it detaches the
public attention from others of equal or greater importance to
the community, or proves a wasting drain to that proportion
of manual labour, which is necessary to the very existence of
those of a more interesting nature; such as, in the present case,
agriculture, and the woollen manufacture, of all others the most
important to this country The superior importance of agri-
culture is obvious at first view.  It produces a very great addi-
tion to the beauty and value of the country; rears a healthy
race of men for its defence; secures plenty of provisions for its
inhabitants; and prevents all that anxiety, distress, and cala-
mity, that usually attend too much dependence on a foreign mar-
ket.  This last mentioned circumstance claims the most serious
consideration, as nothing can be more vain than to amuse us
with false comfort, by turning our attention to other countries
for relief, in case of need such as the present state of agricul-
ture in Scotland seems too strongly to presage; because nothing
can be more precarious, delusive, and dangerous to any peo-
ple, especially in an insular situation, than such dependence.
   Next to agriculture, the woollen manufacture justly demands a
place, in the scale of national importance.  Without wading in-
to the depths of commercial and political discussion on the sub-
ject, or even noticing that partiality in favour of any staple com-
modity of our own country, which is so natural and allowable
in itself, and due from every Briton; it is enough to observe,
that wool, the produce of the very spot where we live, is not
liable to any of those disastrous or adverse accidents, which are
so much connected with the importation of foreign materials,
especially, at a great distance; and which may plunge the prin-
cipal adventurer in disappointment and distress, and leave the
operative manufacturer entirely idle, at a time too, when his
need may be greatest, and he utterly unable to turn himself to
any other employment.  Nor is wool less beneficial to the weav-
er, than safe and encouraging to the manufacturer.  Founded
in nature, the celebrated old chemist's opinion will always be
