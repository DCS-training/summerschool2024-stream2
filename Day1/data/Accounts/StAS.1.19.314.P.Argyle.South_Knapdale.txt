and set sail for Scotland.  He landed on the west coast of
Lochcaolisport, where he built the chapel of Cove, the
walls of which, till of late years, had undergone but little
dilapidation.  Near the end of this church is a consecrated
cave, which gives name to the farm in which it is situated.
Its altar and font still remain, and over them a cross, cut

     "Gu ma luath a bhios do threabhadh
     "Agus gu mo deas a bhios do bhaile."
