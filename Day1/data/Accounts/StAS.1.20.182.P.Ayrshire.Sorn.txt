for which he teaches the children employed in the work
from 7 to 9 o'clock in the evening.  The emoluments of
his day-school will amount to L. 15 annually.  He is allow-
ed an assistant for the evening-school, who receives from the

twist-mill, during the day, as under-clerk.  The teachers
meet the children in school on Sabbath mornings, catechise

   Diseases.-No disease is peculiar to the place.  A few
die of consumptions and fevers.  It gives me pleasure to
add, that inocculation for the small-pox almost universally
prevails.

   Antiquities.-According to tradition a Popish chapel
once stood a little to the east of the village.  It was proba-
bly dedicated to St Cuthbert; for the surrounding field, (in
the form of an amphitheatre), is called St Cuthbert's Holm.
At the upper end of this field, part of a street is built, for
the accommodation of the manufactures.  The suppo-
sed site of the chapel and churchyard has, for years past,
been under tillage.  In removing a large cairn of stones, at
a small distance from the place, 7 or 8 large urns were
found, full of human dust and bones: they fell to pieces on
being exposed to the open air.  they were formed in the
rudest manner, and had evidently been dried in the fun.
Tradition says, the plague was buried there.  The proba-
bility, however, is, that St Cuthbert's Holm was once the
scene of a very bloody battle, perhaps before the introduc-
tion of Christianity into Scotland; for the bones found in
the urns, and every where in the cairn, had evidently been
burned.
