plenty.  Some large pikes 6 feet long, weighing about 25 lib.
have been taken in it.  It yields likewise some grass, as horse
pipes, etc.  Ducks, geese, and sometimes a few swans, fre-
quent this loch, and afford good sport for gentlemen and o-
thers.  In summer it is divided into 2 parts, and the passage for
the water between them may be about 5 feet wide; the loch
is frozen in winter, and may be travelled on.  In its present
state it has many inconveniences.  It frequently overflows in
summer, carries off the fuel, and hurts the corns growing near
it; about it the frosts and mildews are severe, and the wild
fowls destructive, especially in the night time.  It has been
proposed by the proprietors to drain off the water, and render
the grounds arable; the greatest depth when sounded, did not
exceed 6 feet.  The rent, for the almost useless ground at present,
might be considerable, and some marle perhaps got.  Some
years home the plough may be seen going where the ugly
and voracious pikes are now lying; and corns growing
instead of almost useless weeds.  The neighbouring towns would
then be more healthy, and no depredations made on their crops.
   Meal-mead and Craiglich are the most considerable hills;
the latter is steep, and arises from the arable land about a mile.
They are in general covered with heath, having some green
vallies on the sides of the rivulet, and afford pasture to large
flocks of sheep; turf and peat for fuel, and a few birds for
game.
