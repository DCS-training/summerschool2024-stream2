exactly ascertained, as it may vary according to the value of
the ground, or the date of the leases; at a medium, it may
be reckoned at least at 2 l. 5 s. per acre, which would amount
to 2808 l. Sterling; and when the price of grain is high, it
may be considerably more.

   Soil, Produce, etc.-The soil is mostly of a deep clay, and
the land, which is believed to have been antiently covered
by the waters of the neighbouring Frith, is, in general very
rich, and produces plentiful crops of oats, pease, and beans,
barley, wheat, grass, and potatoes.  Mr Nimmo, in his his-
tory of Stirlingshire, informs us, that as early as the 14 th
century, (when, in comparison, little improvement had been
made in agriculture), the yearly feu duty paid to the Crown,
out of the parish of Bothkennar alone, was no less than 26
chalders of victual, besides 6 chalders paid to the Abbacy of
Cambuskenneth.  About that time, or probably at a later
period, the price of grain was so very low, that the proprie-
tors of land in the parishes of Airth and Bothkennar, had it
in their option, when paying the feu-duty, to pay either a
merk Scotch or a boll of wheat.  The former wisely chose
to pay in money, which they still do; and the latter in grain,
which, instead of a merk Scotch, has, for many years past,
been equal in value to 20 s. 25 s. or sometimes even 30 s.
Sterling.  This parish is almost a continued flat; there is
scarcely the least rising ground to be observed through the
whole of it, and not a stone to be seen, unless brought from
other places.  Excepting the roads, there is not a spot of
ground uncultivated.  The method of cultivation, the time
of sowing and reaping, the wages of servants, tradesmen, and
day-labourers, the prices of coal, grain, and provisions, are
in general nearly the same as in the parishes of Airth and
Polmont, to the statistical accounts of which the reader is
