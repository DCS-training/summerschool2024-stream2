                         IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture.-Seventy years ago, agriculture in this parish, as
generally throughout the count of Aberdeen, was in a truly
wretched condition.  The stagnation of water on the low grounds
utterly precluded tillage; while the arable lands were overrun
with noxious weeds, and chilled from November to May by innu-
merable land springs.  The cultivated ground was divided into
what was called infield and outfield.  The former received all the
manure of the farm, and was perpetually in crop.  The latter con-
sisted of " rig and baulk," that is, of arable ridges, between every
two of which there was an interjacent space, termed a " baulk,"
which the plough never disturbed.  The arable part was cropped
with oats five years in succession, and then permitted to lie in pas-
ture for the same number of years, in order to recruit its exhaust-
ed powers of production,  Green crops, with the exception of a
few potatoes and coleworts in the gardens of the farmers and pea-
santry, were unknown.  The implements of husbandry and the
mode of using them were equally rude.  Two men with ten or
twelve oxen yoked in a team barely accomplished the work which
one man with two horses in a plough can at present perform wlth-
out difficulty.  The horses employed in agriculture werd dimi-
nutive in size, and used merely for burden, never for draught.
They carried out manure, and home peats, in paniers or creels,
and the meal to be sold was conveyed to market in sacks laid
