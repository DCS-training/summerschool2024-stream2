     Marischal College and University of Aberdeen.

   College Buildings, etc.-Very little now remains of the old
Franciscan monastery, unless the church, of which the walls,
with a fine Gothic window, are still entire.  Some years since
it was shortened about twenty feet, a new aile built for the
accommodation of the students, and new roofed, at the ex-
pence of the town of Aberdeen.  It being now their proper-
ty, a minister is appointed to it by the magistrates and town
council, but without any parochial duty.  The monastery
having become ruinous, the greater part of the present build-
ings of the College was constructed about 1676, and an ad-
ditional wing in 1739; but having been ill designed, and
erected at different times, they are neither regular, elegant,
nor commodious.  They contain a common school of 76 feet
by 22; a public hall, and library room of the same dimen-
sions; a divinity hall; five other schools or teaching rooms;
an apartment lately fitted up for a museum; another for the
apparatus in natural philosophy; and lodgings for three of
the professors.  There are also detached from the other build-
ings, a laboratory and teaching room for the use of the pro-
fessor of chemistry, and dwelling houses for the two College
servants.
   In the public hall are a good many paintings, but few of
any considerable merit.  There are portraits of several sove-
reigns of the family of Stuart; of the founder of the Uni-
versity; of the late Earl Marischal, and his brother General
Keith; of the Earl of Bute, lately chancellor of the Univer-
sity; of Bishop Burnett;-together with one of Dr Arthur
Johnston, and several others, by Jameson.

   Library, Museum, etc.-The library originally consisted of
no greater collection than what belonged to the Franciscan
friars, containing most of the schoolmen and monkish wri-
ters, and particularly a good number of the Latin fathers in
