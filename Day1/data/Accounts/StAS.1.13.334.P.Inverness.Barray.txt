   Antiquities and Curiosities.-There are several duns in
this parish, most of which were built by the Danes, others
of greater antiquity, built by the natives, to defend them-
selves against the encroachments of the neighbouring clans,
as also of the Danes, when they invaded those islands.
The Danish duns are 11 in number, 5 on the island of
Barry, 2 in Watersay, 1 in Sanderay, 1 in Perbay, 1 in
Mengalay, and 1 in Bernary, the last of which is taken
notice of by the learned Dr Macpherson of Slate, in his
antiquities, and is more entire than any of the rest.  Each
of these duns is in sight of some other, that, in case of an
invasion, the alarm might be the more speedily communi-
cated to the whole.  That upon the island of Berneray,
being the farthest south, it may be supported, serve for a
pharos or watch tower, as well as a place of defence, as
did another in the island of Grifkay, (the property of Co-
lin Macdonald, Esq; of Boisdale, but at that time the pro-
perty of the Laird of Barray,) on the east.  While the
Danes were in possession of these islands, they confined the
natives to their own duns, which are all built on fresh water

purfuers.  He at length arrived with his prisoner at Edinburgh, where
he was tried for his life.  Being interrogated why he treated Queen Eli-
zabeth's subjects with such barbarity, he replied, that he thought himself
bound, by his loyalty, to retaliate, as much as lay in his power, the un-
pardonable injury done by the Queen of England to his own Sovereign,
and his Majesty's mother.  By this answer, he obtained his Majesty's par-
don, but forfeited his estate, which was given to Kintail, who restored
it back to the Laird of Barray, on condition of holding of him, and pay-
ing him 60 merks Scots as a yearly feu-duty.  Some time after, Sir
James Macdonald of Slate, great-great-grandfather of the present Lord
Macdonald, married a daughter of Kintail's, who made over the superi-
ority to Sir James, either as a present or as a part of his daughter's dowry-
The superiority continues in the family of Macdonald to this day.
