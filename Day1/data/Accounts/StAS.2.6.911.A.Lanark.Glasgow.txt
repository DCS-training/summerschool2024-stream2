   Though the new churches have	been in operation but for a very
short time, and though the work in which their ministers and ses-
sions are engaged be a very arduous one, yet it is most gratifying
to be able to state that they are succeeding to an extent beyond what
the most sanguine could have expected.  This is matter of devout
thankfulness to the great Head of the Church.  Restricting our-
selves to the twelve churches which may be said to remain under the
care of the Society, whose proceedings we are now recording, and
which may be said to contain 1000 sittings each, it appears, on of-
ficial authority, that, in November 1840, there were not less than
7630 sittings let.  The congregational attendance, of course, is very
much larger than this number describes.  At the same period,
the communicants in these churches amounted to not less than
4367,--many of them being persons who had not made any pub-
lic profession of religion for years; who may be said to have been
reclaimed from  ignorance and indifference.  At one communion
season, 231 were admitted to the Lord's table for the first time
During the last year there was an increase of 578 communicants
