     Statistical Account

   N. B.  Notwithstanding the astonishing increase of stamp-
duty, and of paper manufactured, yet Scotland must
bring all her stamped paper from London.  The very car-
riage of the stamped paper to Edinburgh, it is believed, costs
Government L. 700 per annum, when it could be stamped
at Edinburgh for a trifle, and the manufacture of paper
thereby greatly encouraged.  The present mode appears
to be neither just nor politic.-By the articles of the U-
nion, Scotland is entitled to have a board of Stamps.

   N. B.  It would be too tedious to enter into a detail of the
history and progress of this Band.-The capital at pre-
sent is above L. 600,000; and the liberal support it has
given to the landed, commercial, and manufacturing in-
terests of Scotland, has added greatly to the prosperity
of the country.
