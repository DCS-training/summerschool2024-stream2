and liberal contribution have been made for encouraging
people to settle in them.  This plan, however, does not
promise success.  It is upon too extensive a scale.  The
strong local attachment of the Highlanders has not been at-
tended to.  By the plan of these villages, they will be at
too great a distance from each other.  It is expected that
people will come to them for 60 miles round or upwards.
This will not thake place.  If a Highlanders is force or in-
duced to leave the small circle which occupied his first af-
fections, he cares not how far he goes from home.  Going
to another parish, or to the district of another clan, is to
him entire banishment; and when he has resolved to set
out, whether from necessity or choice, he would as soon
cross the Atlantic as he would cross an arm of the sea.  It
is only an immediate and a very clear advantage that would
induce him to stop.  The fishing villages have not this to
offer.  It is only in the course of a series of years, that the
settlers have a prospect of being comfortable.  To keep
the people from emigrating, villages must be frequent, their
prejudices must be attended to, and encouragement held out
to them to settle in the close neighbourhood of their origi-
nal homes; and here it will be found that very moderate
advantages will satisfy them.

   Hint for Improvements.-When 3 or 4 farms are thrown
into one possession, and coverted into a sheep-walk, and
of course a number of families obliged to remove, let a 
farm in the neighbourhood be pitched upon, where fuel is
convenient, where part of the lands is arable, and where
there is a track of ground capable of cultivation; let it be
inclosed, and subdivided; let houses be built, and the
people will flock to it.  They cannot at first pay much
rent; but by degrees, as they improve the land, and get in-
to the way of other employments, they will be enabled
