   Some more than a year ago, a few belonging to the parish
began the spinning of cotton on mule jennies, which they are
still doing, having 15 constantly going, and a small carding
mill which goes by water, for preparation.  And as they
mean to extend their work to the number of 30 jennies, they
are now building a carding-mill on a larger scale, to go by
water, to answer the purpose of preparation for the above
number.  The cotton yarn is not manufactured in the place,
but is sent to the Paisley or Glasgow markets.  Those at pre-
sent employed in the above work, including men, women, and
children, may be about 50; and when the work is doubled,
those employed will be in proportion.  There is in the vil-
lage, and country part of the parish, a sufficient number of
common weavers, shoemakers, smiths, wrights, tailors, and
those who sell grocery goods, and all kinds of men and women's
apparel, of the best and finest kind.  And as to ale and whis-
ky-houses, of them there are more than is necessary, to the
great prejudice of the temporal interest and morals of too
many, and especially of those who can, with ease, earn from
2 s. to 3 s. a-day; the prosperity of such persons often de-
stroys them.  The village is a most convenient situation for
manufactures, on account of its healthy situation, easy rents,
and cheap fuel, when compared with many places in the
neighbourhood.  And for carrying on a bleaching business, I
suppose a more convenient situation cannot be found, having
so many streams of water all around; but nothing of this kind
has as yet been tried.
