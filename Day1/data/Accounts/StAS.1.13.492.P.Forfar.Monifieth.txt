What they beheld they imitated, and many soon saw with
satisfaction their own fields covered with a similar beauty
and fertility.  The old Scottish ploughs were dismissed
apace; and at present there is not one in the parish.  The
old Scottish plough improved, however, continues in ge-
neral use.  A few of Small's newly invented make, have
been introduced, but are found to succeed only in lands
that are level and free from incumbrance.  There is but

farm.  The other farmers employ men to thrash out their
grain, called lot-men, who generally reside in the neigh-
bourhood, and receive as wages the twenty-fifth boll of

or be planted with trees.  If they were planted; the roots
of the trees would harden the soil, and prevent the en-
croachment of the sea.  An extensive clump of firs plant-

thriven well.  If some plan of this sort be not adopted,
the period perhaps, is not distant, when they will all be a-
gain completely inundated.  From the links between the
light-house and village of Monifieth, (a space of about
2 miles,) within the last 40 years, the sea has plundered up-

   Fisheries.-The fisheries of this parish are inconsiderable.
The salmon fishings pay a yearly rent of no more than
L. 130.  Fifteen years ago, before any were sent from this
parish to London, they were sold in the adjacent villages,
and in Dundee at 1 1/2d. the lb.  Since that period , a pound
of almon has not been sold under 4 d.  At first fight, it
