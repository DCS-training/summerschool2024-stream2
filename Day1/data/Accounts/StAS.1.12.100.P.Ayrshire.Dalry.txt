cheese, amounting in whole to 13,200 stones, the stone being
16 lib., and the pound 24 ounces.  The cheese, in general, is
of as good a quality as any made in the west country, and is
mostly sold in the Greenock, Paisley, and Glasgow markets.
The horses raised in the parish are but few.  Those kept by
the farmers, are generally young, and of a large size.  The
common method of supplying themselves is, they buy them
when 2 or 3 years old, from the yearly market at Lanark,
where large quantities are sold of all sizes.  They keep them
for 1 or 2 years, and with the easy work of ploughing their
farms, with little more work they put them to, this with
good feeding, raises them to a large size, and then they sell
them, often at double the prices they bought them at; and in
this way many farmers have considerably increased their
stock.  Many such horses have of late been sold from 30 L.
to 40 L.  The amount of horses in the parish may be about
300.

boast of having so many; no fewer than 9, great and small,
are to be found within half a mile of the village, and those
mostly built at the expense of the parish, which shows a pro-

and much to their credit surely it is, as the village cannot be
approached without crossing some water or burn, and on each
of which a bridge is to be found.

   Stipend, School, Poor, &c.-There are 3 clergymen in the
village of Dalry, the minister of the Established Church,
of the Antiburgher, and the Burgher Seceders, both of whom
