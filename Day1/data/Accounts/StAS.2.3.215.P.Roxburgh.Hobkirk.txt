wise the most expensive.  A good five-feet wall may be erect-
ed for 6s. to 11s. per rood of eighteen feet, according to the
distance from quarries.  The building costs about 2s., the quarrying
2s. or 3s., and the leading makes up the remainder.  Two kinds
of hedges are employed for enclosures.  1st, That of thorn, which
is here apt to moss up and canker, from the dampness of the cli-
mate. 2d, That of whin or furze, which has been lately introduced
with apparently great advantage.  It is at once cheaper than thorn,
more easily reared, and sooner available as a fence.  As this is a
subject of importance to farmers, the following comparative view
may be acceptable:--Thorn.  Making ditch per rood, 10d.; thorns
at 10d., 64 to a rood, including transport, 8d. ; fencing with stake
and rice, 1s. 0 1/2d.; total, 2s. 6 1/2d.  This, in order to be a compe-
tent hedge,   Will require six or seven years of incessant care, and
at least one renewal of the protecting fence.--Whin. Making bed,
3d.; ditch if required, 3d.; seed at 1s. per lb. 1d.; fencing 1s.O 1/2d.;
total, 1s. 7 1/2d.  In four, or at most five years, this will be an effi-
cient fence without any renewal of the temporary protection.
   The calculation of the stake and rice stands thus : Rice at 1s.
per cart, 3d. per rood; stakes, eight to the rood, 6d. ; carting, 2d.,
putting up, 1 1/2d. ; total, 1s. O l/2d.  Three bar pailing will run thus
Wood, say 2s. 5d.; sawing, 4 1/2d.; nails, eleven to the rood, at
10d., 1d.; labour 1 1/2d.; carting, 2d. ; total, 3s. 2d.
   Pailing is certainly preferable on the score of cleanliness; for a
stake and rice fence harbours weeds.  But this latter, besides being
cheaper, turns to use an article, which would otherwise be in a
great measure lost, viz. the thinnings of plantations.  The seed of
the whin is sown in April, and the plants, if kept from rotting by
too much wetness, shoot away rapidly in the course of the season.
The hedge being evergreen, presents a warm and beautiful appear-
ance throughout the year; but regular pruning or switching up is
necessary in order to prevent decay in the heart, and seeding.  From
this latter source, indeed, is anticipated the greatest objection to,
this kind of fence; for unless carefully watched, the furze will soon
usurp the whole field.
   Produce.--The following may be regarded as au approach to
the value of raw produce yearly raised in the parish:
