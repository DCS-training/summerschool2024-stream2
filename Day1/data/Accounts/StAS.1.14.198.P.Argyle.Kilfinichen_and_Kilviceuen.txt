ritors, owing to bad times, bankruptcies, and perhaps
high rents, were obliged to give deductions; so that the
rent is now rather lower upon the whole.  The incum-
bent has in his hands a copy of the real rent of the pa-
rish in 1771.  It was then 961 L. 12 s. 1 1/2 d.,:  There has
been but little augmentation laid upon the Duke of Ar-
gyll's property since that period.

   Services.-The Duke of Argyll exacts services of no
kind of his tenants; the rest of the heritors do.  Services
are always stipulated, and consist chiefly in cutting peats,
and leading them home to the proprietors houses.  As
coals are now duty free, it is probable, that whatever
other services may be exacted, there will be none as to
peats.

   Antiquities.-In this the island of I takes the lead.
Writers mention this island under three names, viz. Hii,
Iona, and Icolumkill.  Bede calls it Hii, but the proper
name is I*, which in the Gaelic signifies an island, and
is called so by way of eminence to this day.  Bede's
mistake proceeded from his ignorance of the Gaelic.  In
monkish writers, it is called Iona+, which signifies the
Island of Waves.  In more modern times, it was called
I-collum-kill; that is, the island of Colum-kill, in ho-
nour of Columba.  The name Iona is now quite lost in
the country, and it is always called I, except when the
speaker would wish to lay an emphasis upon the word,
then it is called Icolumkill++.

*I is founded like ee in English.
+Iona is, in Gaelic, spelt I-thonn; but as the th is not founded, La-
tin writers spell it Iona.  The name is very characteristick of it in times
of slorm.
++Bede writes, that I belonged to Britain, being separated from it, as
he says, but by a narrow arm of the sea; and that the Picts, who in-
