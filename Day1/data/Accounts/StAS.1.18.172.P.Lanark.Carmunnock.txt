rudely carved, were found; in which the ashes of the dead
seem to have been deposited.  Their contents within consist-
ed chiefly of a dry unctuous earth, mixed with human bones;
and a sort of reedy substance, which, perhaps it is impossible
for us now to explain.  We can form no credible conjecture
about the time when these urns were first deposited in the
earth; and few things have been found, so as to ascertain,
whether they are Roman, or Celtic; but it is most probable,
that they are the latter; and that the tumuli in which they
are placed, have been raised in the time of the druids, before
the christian aera.  Commonly in the midst of the mound,
square stones are placed, which form a kind of chest, or
stone-coffin, in which the bones of the warrior, or of some
person of superior rank and authority, have been consigned to
the earth.  It is remarkable, that all these chests are formed
of fine free-stone, which must have been brought from a dis-
tance, as there is nothing of the kind to be found in this part
of the parish.
   In the estate of Castlemilk, are found the remains of a
Roman causeway, or military road; and in an adjoining field,
several pieces of ancient armour, with camp utensils, were
lately dug up.  The helmet and neckpiece are of an uncom-
mon size, and though they are much corroded, and must
have lain long in the earth, they still weigh near 18 lib.

   In the house of Castlemilk, which is noted for its fine si-
tuation, the unfortunate Mary is said to have lodged the
night before the battle of Langside.  Many different spots are
pointed out in the neighbourhood, where, the following day,
she viewed the discomfiture of her army, which was the ruin
of all her fortunes.  The most probable place, is upon the
brow of the eminence above Castlemilk, where a spring
issues from the rock, and moistens the root of a thorn-tree,
