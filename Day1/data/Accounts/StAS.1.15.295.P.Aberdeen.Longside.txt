who has heard the pronounciation of Dutch from the mouth
of a well educated Dutchman; and still more, if he has at-
tended the theatre at Dresden or Leipsic.  In this corner we
retain all the broadness of articulation, and, I am forty to
add, all the vulgarity of idiom, metaphor, and accent, which
is to be met with in any part of the world.  And it is pro-
bable that we shall retain these peculiarities of language

cause, except the resort of strangers to Peterhead, during the
water-season, few visit us; and, of consequences little of that
intercourse is enjoyed, by which language is so materially af-

phors, and that polish of articulation and accent, which are
too often considered as the most essential ingredients in good
language, are rather the effect of a cultivated taste, than of
a cultivated understanding.  And though we may be obliged
to give up the former, it is not necessary, on that account, to
give up all pretensions to the latter.  On the contrary, the

districts of the same county.  They have not their liveliness
of imagination, nor their warmth of feeling.  They seem to
