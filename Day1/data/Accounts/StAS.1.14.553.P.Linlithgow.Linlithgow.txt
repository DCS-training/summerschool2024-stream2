     Of Linlithgow.

   The art of tanning is said to have been imperfectly
known hero till some of Cromwell's soldiers both instruct-
ed others, and plied it themselves.
   Shoemaking forms a chief branch of the trade here.  It
employs about 100 persons; and the number of pairs made
annually is computed at 24,000.  Considerable quantities
were formerly exported to America.  Though the demand
has now failed, the shoemakers have, in general, a ready
sale, and at times, pretty large commissions.  Some of the
charitable foundations in Edinburgh are supplied from this
place with shoes.  They are now (December 1793) mak-

benefits of that inequality, without which society cannot

than any other arguments, to explode the reasoning, and
counteract the efforts of designing men.
   Wool is another staple commodity here.  Three persons
from this town go annually into Northumberland, and
purchase a considerable quantity.  Part of this is short,

greatest part of the wool brought here is long, and fit for
combing.  This part of the process was introduced by
workmen from England; but all the people now employ-
ed in it, amounting to 24, are fixed inhabitants of the
town.  The quantity of wool brought to Linlithgow is
much the same as for many years past; for though the
