                           PARISH OF KIRKDEN. *

PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	THE REV. DAVID CARRUTHERS, MINISTER.

		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
Name.--THIS parish, which is landward, was anciently called
Idvie, owing to the glebe being situated in the barony of ldvies,--
with the etymology of which vocable we are not acquainted.  Its
modern name, however, is Kirkden-evidently derived from the
fact of tbe church being placed in a sort of dell or valley, which
depressions are termed dens in this quarter.
	Extent and Boundaries.--In length from east to west, it mea-
sures nearly 7 miles; its greatest breadth is not more th`n 2; at
one part, within a mile east of the church, it does not exceed a
stone-cast in width; and its whole superficies is nearly 7 square
miles.  It is bounded on the north, by Rescobie and Guthrie; on
the south, by Carmylie; by Kinnell and Inverkeillor, on the east;
and by Dunnichen, on the west.
	Topographical Appearances.--The parish is of an irregular fi-
gure, but its surface, though gently undulated, is comparatively
level, with the exception of a considerable ascent, towards
south, formed by the termination of the Sidlaw Hills.  From this
elevation, the eye ranges over a rich and extensive panorama. Im-
mediately around, are the mansions, woods, and lawns of many of
the country gentlemen; to the west, is the fertile and picturesque
valley of Strathmore, on the back ground of which  are the aspir-
ing summits and grand rugged passes of the Grampian mountains;
and to the east are the towns, and bays, and headlands, along the
coast.
	Meteorology, &c.--The prevailing wind is from the east, which,
during the months of spring, carries dense aqueous vapours, here
termed eastern haars, exhaled from the German Odean.  No par-
ticular disease can be said to prevail.
