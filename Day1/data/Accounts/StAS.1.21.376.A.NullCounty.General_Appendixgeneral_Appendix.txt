which they will give no reason, but that none of their ances-
tors attempted it, and consequently that their lands are unfit
for it; but I have this season shewn them the contrary, hav-
ing, for experiment, sown one peck of seed on the banks of
the Argnach, and another on the top of one of the driest
hills, in a small plot manured last season with lime, and both
grew well; the former best adapted for making fine, the lat-
ter coarse yarn.
   I think this a proper place, to give an account of another
species cf employment, in which the inhabitants of this pa-
rish and adjacent district, spend much of their time, namely,
that of distilling.  As every cottager, to a man, distils his
oats into spirits, every cabbin becomes alternately a whisky
house, until the produce is drank.  The neighbours making
it a point to help out the consumption of their friends pro-
duce, he, in turn, pays his compliment in the same way; and
a rotation of idleness and drinking is the consequence.  The
women also, being rather idler than the men, seem very great
promoters of this traffic.  I have have 12 stills reckoned to

   8th query.  In parts of the parish, adjacent to Balfarnon,
they have, many years ago, used limestone gravel with suc-
cess.  In the parts eastward, and north of Cross Hill, they
have never used any manures for the improvement of their
lands, except dung.  I have asked them the reason, and
they told me that their soil never produced marl, limestone,
or limestone gravel; that they never were used to improve,
and if they had, the consequence would be, their being turn-
ed out of their farms, when meliorated.  I have this summer
shewn them their mistake in their two first reasons, by pro-
ducing, from every hill I tried, good limestone, and lime-
stone gravel.  I have turned out some of the latter on the
land, and have burned the former into good manuring lime;
