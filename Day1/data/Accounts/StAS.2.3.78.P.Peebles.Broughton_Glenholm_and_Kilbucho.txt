                              UNITED PARISHES OF

BROUGHTON, GLENHOLM, & KILBUCHO.

PRESBYTERY OF BIGGAR, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEEDDALE.

      THE REV. HAMILTON PAUL, MINISTER.

       I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

     THIS parish, which comprehends the old parishes of Broughton
and Glenholm, with the southern or larger division of Kilbucho,
retains, agreeably to the provisions of the deed of annexation, all
the tree names.
     Names--Boundaries.---The origin of the designation Glenholm
is sufficiently obvious.  Kilbucho spelled Kilbeuckhoe, Kilbochoe,
Kilbocho, and Kirkbucho, is supposed to be the Gaelic term for the

the Scottish dialect means a circle, the name has taken its rise
from this circumstance of locality; "the town or village within the
brough or circle of hills."
     This united parish is bounded on the west and north-west by
Culter and Skirling; by Kirkurd on the north; on the east and
north-east by Stobo; and by Drummelzier on the south and south-
east.  The Tweed divides it from Drummelzier for about four miles.
It is nine miles and a half in length, and three and a-half in breadth,
containing a superficies of thirty square miles.
     Topographical Appearances.--The surface of the fround is beau-

would be extremely picturesque in respect of scenery.  It is re-
markable that there are only three hills or detached insulated emi-
nences in Tweeddale.  Rachan Hill in Glenholm, which is one of
