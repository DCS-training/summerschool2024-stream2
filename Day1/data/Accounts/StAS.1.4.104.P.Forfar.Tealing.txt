of arable with good stone fences, and near 100 acres of
pasture and meadow ground with hedge and ditch; erec-
ted 3 considerable new farms; let a number of convenient
possessions to the manufacturers at very reasonable rents;
doubled his rents upon the whole; and all without bring-
ing any incumbrance upon his estate:  He keeps a consi-
derable farm in his own hand, and excites his tenants to
the practice of good husbandry by his own example.
   The fuel commonly used is turf, which is brought from
the neighbouring hills.  Coal is likewise transported from
Dundee, and its use is greatly increasing.  There are from
40 to 50 ploughs made after the best form.
   In this parish there are still some cottagers on almost
every farm.  Farmers differ somewhat in their notions
about employing them.  It is generally allowed, that
turning off cottages has an immediate tendency to make
a scarcity of hands, and of consequence to raise wages; and
that where there are no people of this description, it occa-
sions one considerable inconvenience in the time of harvest,
as then the corns must be cut down chiefly by strangers,
who, in tedious harvests and rainy weather, are a heavy
burden on the farmer.  Cottagers, after all, are generally
in a poor and dependent situation, and perhaps little vil-
lages of manufacturers and tradesmen, immediately depen-
dent on the land-owner, might answer the purposes of the 
farmer equally well, would be happier in themselves, and
of greater advantage to their country.
