of it; on the south side there is an impassable morass, and
formerly it probably was inaccessible on all sides.  A gen-
tleman who has seen these, says, he has seen in Ireland pits
somewhat similar, near the high-roads, where poor people
came out with their children begging for charity; but
these pits never could have been formed for that purpose,
as no high-road is near them, nor any apparent inducement
for their residence there.

   Meteors and Hurricane.-On the 10th of November
1766, when assisting at the communion at St Fergus, a
neighbouring parish about 5 miles to the N. W. of this
place, I observed in the evening a very extraordinary ap-
pearance in the air; looking to the S. E. about a mile
from the church, there was the appearance of a light some-
what like the aurora borealis.  The rays gradually became
more vivid and stationary, seeming like a gleam of fire,
extending about a quarter of a mile from E. to W.  It
continued for several hours, and then disappeared.  I have
never heard of such a phenomenon in this country, though
I am informed it is frequently observed in the West Indies.
   In January 1773, there was a remarkable high wind,
which truly might have been called a hurricane, it un-
roofed many houses here, and in several parishes at some
distance from this place, destroyed a great number of trees,
which were old, and of a large size; many were torn up
from the roots, and some entirely split.  At the manse of
Peterhead it did considerable damage; the slates were torn
off the house; the top of the peat-stack beat into dust like
powder; the ricks in the corn-yard turned down, and
sheaves carried to the distance of some hundred yards; a
hay-rick, in the form of an oblong square, was cut through
the middle as with a knife, from one end to the other.
The wind blew from the S. W.
