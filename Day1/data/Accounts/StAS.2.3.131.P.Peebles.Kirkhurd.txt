betwixt L. II and L. 13; and of women-servants betwixt L. 5 and
L. 6 for the same period. The wages of women-servants are much
higher in summer than in winter, owing, no doubt, to the greater
amount of labour to which they are subjected in the one season
than in the other.
   Husbandry.-All kinds of grain excepting wheat and beans are
raised, and it is found that the more early kinds suit better than
the later. Wheat, indeed, has been attempted, but this so partially,
as scarcely to merit notice.* The green crop cultivation is much at-
tended to, and potatoes and turnips are generally of excellent qua-
lity. The dairy system is carried on here to a considerable extent,
and it has been said that the farmers are nearly enabled to pay their
rents from the produce of their cows.
   The plan of irrigating meadow ground has been adopted in some
places in the parish very successfully.-It has been ascertained that
some water meadows have produced on an average about 400
stones of hay per acre, reckoning 22 lbs. to the stone.
   As to the duration of leases, it may be stated, that all farms, with
a few exceptions, are let for nineteen years, and if they are let on
an average at 20s. per acre, both landlord and tenant are consider-
ed as equally benefited.
   Very little can be said in praise of the farm-buildings in the pa-
rish. These are commonly taken by estimate, and the lowest is
generally preferred. Hence the farm-houses are rather superfi-
cially built. It has now, however, become customary for the te-
nants themselves to drive materials for the buildings, and this
no doubt tends, with as little cost as formerly to the proprietor, to
secure a more substantial and comfortable erection.
   Produce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as
follows:
