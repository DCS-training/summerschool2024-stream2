of submitting to the sentence of such a court, and set the bailies
at defiance. But it is most remarkable, that, in no instance was
this ever the case ; and the court goes on at the resent day with
the greatest efficiency and regularity. The Court is held now
once in the fortnight; when the bailies are decently dressed, and
no one is allowed to appear before them in their " heugh dudds,"
that is, in their pit clothes.
   The head bailie or preses is chosen by the proprietor of the col-
liery. At one time, he remained in office seven years; but it was
found expedient to shorten the period to three years.
   The manner of electing the four assistant bailies is this: The two
oldest colliers who are working at the coal-wall, and are in the list
of count makers, give in a list of twelve workmen to the proprietor,
who they think are men of discretion, and fit for the office of bailie,-
from this list the four assistant bailies are chosen by the proprie-
tor.
   This court of equity has now more than realized the objects
which Lord Erskine had in view, and its influence has greatly
tended to improve the general conduct of the men.
   The Alloa Colliers' Fund or Friendly Society.--This Society
was instituted in the year 1775, for the purpose of raising a fund
for payment of schoolmasters, burying of the dead, and supporting
old and sick persons belonging to the colliery, and members of
the society.
   The progress of this fund may be illustrated by the following
statement:

<TABLE>
                		                  Received.	  Paid out.
   From January 1775 to January 1776,	         L. 19 15 2	 L.11 7 6
   For the year from Martinmas 1833 to, Martin-
	mas 1834,                                  345  3 5	  382 7 0

   Another fund was instituted in the end of the year 1833, for
providing support to members and their widows in old age.
   So correctly were these Societies managed, that the aggregate
surplus stock, lying at interest at 5 per cent. was at Martinmas
1835 as follows:

<TABLE>

        Surplus stock of the old fund,	    L.251 3 11
	Surplus stock of the new fund,	     1124 6  0
                                             _________
	            Total surplus stock,   L.1375 9 11
  The two funds are now united, and the	surplus stock had, in
1839, increased to about L.1600.
