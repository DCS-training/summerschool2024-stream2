besides a great many swine, a pig being kept and fed by al-
most every householder, together with lamb and mutton in
summer and harvest; butcher meat, of one kind or another,
making a great part of the diet of the farmers and their ser-
vants, which, perhaps, is cheaper upon the whole, than the
low diet upon which they were formerly fed.
