	            V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
Some years ago, two fairs were annually held in this parish;
but now there is only one, which takes place in the end of July for
cattle, sheep, cheese, &c.  At Buckie Burn, there is a post-office,
with a daily delivery.  There is no regular market for butcher-
meat; but at Buckie, and the other villages, wheaten bread and
groceries can be procured.
  Villages in the parish.---There are six villages, viz. five fishing;
Buckie, Porteasy, Findochtie, Portnockie, Port Gordon, and
Rathven, which requires no description.
  Buchie is situated at the mouth of the Burn of Buckie, and
belongs to Sir James Gordon, Bart.; on the west side of this burn
and on the east of it, to John Gordon, Esq. of Cluny. According
to the last census, it contains a population of 2005.  The west
side has been a fishing station for nearly 200 years, and is the
oldest in the parish.  At what time the other side became a fish-
ing station, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.
