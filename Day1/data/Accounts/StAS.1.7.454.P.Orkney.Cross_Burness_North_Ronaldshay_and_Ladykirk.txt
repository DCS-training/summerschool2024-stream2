is sometimes, but rarely caught.  A variety of sea plants are
thrown ashore by storms.  Sponges are found.-Not many
shells or corals.  Cockles are found in two places only, and
in still water.-No oysters.  In the isle of North Ronaldshay
they catch seals in nets; but they alledge the light-house
lately erected there frightens them from their coasts.  The
people there have been in use to eat the young and tender
ones.

   Manure.-The general manure in these islands is the sea-
weed or ware, which is driven ashore in storms, so that the
farmer anxiously waits for a gale of wind from that quarter
of the compass that will supply him with it, and as these
islands receive it from every quarter, if the gale is strong e-
nough to break it away from the deeps of the ocean where it
grows, it always supplies some place:  but the tides often car-
ry it away from the shore, so that when it comes, every other
work is suspended, until it be carried from the reach of the
sea, which necessarily occasions the farmers keeping a greater
number of servants and horses than they would otherwise do,
for if the sandy grounds are not well manured with this they
give no crop.  In the West India islands where they use this
sea-weed, or varech, (as it is there called), they suppose that
the sugars therewith produced, are of inferior quality to those
produced from other manures, so likewise, the corns raised
by it here, are of inferior quality to those raised by compost
manures, at least the boll weighs less, although the quantity
produced from an acre is more than the produce of an acre
done with comport manure.

   Kelp.-It is about 70 years since kelp was first made here.
The quantity at first was inconsiderable, and the price low.
For 30 years past it has been the staple commodity of these
