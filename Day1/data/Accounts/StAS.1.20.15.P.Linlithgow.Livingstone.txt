appeal to common observation, if, in such a situation, sands
ever acquire, in the interval of the tides, such a state of
dryness as to admit of being blown by the winds.
   We shall assign two reasons for conjecturing that this
battle was sought further up the river, and at, or near, the
New Bridge.  First, From the name of the village at the
mouth of this river; it retains to this day, for a considerable
way up, the name of the Water of Cramond, which may of
itself account for the mistake; but, secondly, If there was
really any blowing of sand, it was more likely to happen
at the place we have mentioned than at Cramond; for here,
notwithstanding the long culture the soil has received, it is
still extremely sandy and loose, and, 800 years ago, it was
probably a mere barren sandy plain.
   At the passage of the Almond, near Livingstone, vesti-
ges have lately been discovered, which shew, with still
greater certainty, that this also has been the theatre of war.
On the south bank of that river, immediately opposite to
Livingstone house, there are 4 pretty large irregular mounts,
which, till of late, were not supposed to be artificial; upon
minute inspection, however, they appear to be so, from the
still visible excavations of the earth near them, out of which
they have been formed, the confusion of the materials of
which they are composed, and that a great number of stone-
coffins have been discovered near the surface of two of
them, some of these containing the visible remains of hu-
man skeletons, which, upon being exposed to the air, crum-
bled into dust.  These coffins were formed of rough flag-
stones, had no top or covering of stone, and were in gene-
ral not more than 5 feet long.  Several other coffins, of the
same kind and dimensions, have been dug up in ths neigh-
bourhood, but no where in such numbers as here.  By the
country people they are uniformly ascribed to the Picts;
and hence a vulgar tradition, that these people were of a
