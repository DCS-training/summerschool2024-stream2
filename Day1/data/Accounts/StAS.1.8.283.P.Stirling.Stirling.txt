   Manufactures.-As far back as the end of the 16th century,
shalloons, manufactured in Stirling to a considerable extent,
were sent over to the Low Countries.  Bruges was then the
staple port for Scotch commodities.  The manufacturers mis-
taking their own interest, and debating the quality of their
shalloons, soon lost, however, the advantages of that gainful
branch of trade, and the town became miserably poor.
Though the manufacture was greatly hurt by such conduct,
yet it was never entirely dropt.  Coarse shalloons continued
to be manufactured in Stirling; and at present this branch is
considerably revived.  For several years past, perhaps not
less than 200,000 yards of this commodity have been annual-
ly manufactured in Stirling, and its neighburhood.  To-
wards the beginning of this century, and during the decay of
the shallon manufactory, that of the Tartan started up in its
place.  It continued to flourish till about the year 1760, but

facture flourishes.  For several years, one company has em-

thing else, obliges many to connect themselves with those, with whom, for a long time, they
only seemed to associate.
