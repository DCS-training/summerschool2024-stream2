                 The season 1832, in which Asiatic cholera prevailed, was the
             year in which the greatest number of deaths occurred, the number
             in that year being 28, of whom 13 died of cholera.  If the 13 who
             died of cholera were not, taken into account, it would reduce the
             average of deaths in the seven years to 17, and render it very nearly
             equal to the number of marriages, The year 1833, which succeed-
             ed the season of the cholera, was more than usually healthy, the
             number of deaths in that year being only 8.  Thhs would seem to
             prove that some of those who were carried off by cholera were
             those of feeble constitution, and who would have died by other
             diseases, or by the course of nature, in the following season.  The
             deaths in be season of the choldra itself too, if the number who
             died of that disease be deducted, falls below the average; which
