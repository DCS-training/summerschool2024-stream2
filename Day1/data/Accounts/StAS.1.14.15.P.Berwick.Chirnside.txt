cept those of Whitehall, were few, and not properly pre-
pared to receive them.  The few wedders and ewes, kept
by the gentlemen for domestic use, had instructed them
in the profits to be made of this useful animal; than
which, if duly fed, and attended to, no other can be turn-
ed to more account.  The laying down of lands, manu-
red, and in good condition, for pasture, was one of the
gretest objects in husbandry; because, by means of it,
land could be rested from exhausting corn crops, and yet,
produce what was equal to the best value of them.  This
could not be doubted, when experience showed what
fields, of a more early, and sweeter grass, than the natu-
ral kind, could be obtained, by the sowing of the white clo-
ver-feed.  The use and advantage of the red clover, mix-
ed with rye-grass feed, also been proved in the luxu-
riancy of its crops, that might be cut for the labouring
cattle, or made into hay.  The neighbourhood of Nor-
thumberland, where much attention had been paid to the
breed of the horses, assorded the opportunity of improving
that of the country, when now the ploughing with
oxen began to be difufed, and, in the lighter lands the
more expeditious and tractable two-horse draught, to be
sdopted.  In general, it appeared, by the improvements
in husbandry made by the gentlemen farmers, that is
progress was such, as to combine the proper and advanta-
geous breed of all the live stock upon farms, and especial-
ly that of sheep, with the growth of corn.  Whence might
be added, the profits of the diary, to those of the barn-
floor; and, in particular seasons, the defects of the latter
be, in some measure, compensated by the benefits of the
former.
