but great shoals of them come at different periods of the same
season, and go away again in a few days thereafter.  They
are always caught in the night-time; and the darker the
night is, the better for the fishers, provided it be free of rain.
In this village there is a red-herring house, where they cured
last year 500 barrels fine red-herring.  There are other two
fishing houses of an older standing, in the neigbourhood of
Ullapool; one at Isle Martin, about 4 or 5 miles north of Ul-
lapool.  This house was erected, about 20 years ago, by a
company of Liverpool gentlemen, who keep an overseer
there during the fishing season, every year; and they have
often reaped considerable profits from this trade.  The other
house of this kind is at Isle Tanera, a little distant to the
north of Isle Martin; which was erected, in the year 1785,
by a London company and a Mr Roderick Morison from
Stornoway, a man of extensive mercantile talents, who was
undertaker for the building, and afterwards became manager
for the company.  During his superintendency, the fishing
proved a lucrative branch of business for the company; but
he died in summer 1791; and soon after the company was
dissolved, and the house and appendages sold to a Mr Mac-
donald from the Isle of Sky.  This gentleman has not had
time to make much of the fishing as yet; but, in so favour-
able a situation for that business, it is not to be doubted, but
he will soon experience the same good success with his pre-
decessors.  The herring cured in this country are lent to dif-
ferent markets, most frequently to Leith and Greenock,
where they fetch high prices.  Some are likewise exported
to Ireland, where they usually sell to great advantage.  There
is a salmon fishing, close to the village, on the river of Ulla-
pool.  There are also other two salmon fishings in the parish;
one at Inverlael, and the other at Meikle Gruinard.  But
