nually sold.  The number of black-cattle exceeds 1350; of
which the drover annually purchases 300.-290 horses are em-
ployed in farming business, whereof not above one-half are
reared in the parish, the market furnishing the rest.  The far-
mers commonly employ 263 carts and 85 ploughs; and the
ploughs are generally of the light Scotch, or common English
kind.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-Peat is the fuel made use of in
the parish, and of it there is great abundance, and of the best
quality.  It is to be regretted, however, that much time and
labour are lost in providing this necessary of life.  Genteel fa-
milies begin to use coal in their rooms, a practice which would
profitably prevail if the impolitic duty on coal was abolish-
ed.-The roads, tolerably good, were originally formed,
and are still repaired by statute labour, which may be convert-
ed at the rate of 1 s. 6 d. per annum.  The rivulets are passable
at all seasons, by means of bridges, erected at the expence of
the parish or district.  As there is no post road, the expence
of turnpikes would be useless and intolerable.-The names
of all the farms, that have not been anglified to suit with mo-
dern subdivisions, evidently originate from the Celtic:-
e. g.  Montquhitter, or, the Place for ensnaring the Deer;
Auchry, the Red or the King's Haugh; Balthangie, Angus-
town, etc.
   The wild heath seems to wave over the grave of many a
long forgotten hero, on these fields where contending ba-

Findlay's Mire) to these spots where they fell.  And some
heads of spears, of a yellow colour, and of the form most ap-
proved when the Scottish spear was almost as tremendous a
