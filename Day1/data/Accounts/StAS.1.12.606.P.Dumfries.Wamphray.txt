     Statistical Account

Songs are still sung descriptive of the barbarous deeds and 
bloody feuds of some former age, of which this parish was
the scene.  The road between Glasgow and Carlisle runs
through the parish.  It was made about 20 years ago.  A-
long this road, a mail-coach passes and repasses every day.

   Antiquities.-In the track of the above, there was a Ro-
man road, by the side of which, a few large stones, each a-
bout 5 feet high, are still standing, nearly at the distance of
a Scotch mile from one another, and, therefore, supposed by
some to have been mile-stones.  Beside one of these, Charles
II. is said to have passed the night in going to England, a
little before the battle of Worcester.  There is a Druidical
circle almost entire.
