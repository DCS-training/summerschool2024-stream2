    ing many insults, and much cruelty, was, on the 6th of May, exe-
    cuted at Mauchline. "No coffins" (saith the venerable Wod-
    row*) "were allowed, nor dead-clothes, but the soldiers and two
    countrymen made a hole in the earth, into which they cast him,
    together with other four, his fellow-martyrs."

	It is worthy of remark, that there is one woman, a widow, in the
    parish, now in her ninety-fourth year, and that about two years
    ago the writer of this account met her in her own house, along
    with her three brothers and her sister, all children of the
    same father and mother, and all hale and healthy, though their
    united ages amounted to 438 years.
	Character and Habits of the People.-As to the outward cir-
    cumstances of the people of this parish we must report very fa-
    vourably. While there are some who can afford to live in the
    most comfortable manner, there is the absence of every thing like
    squalid poverty; for, even in our humblest cottages, through the
    abounding beneficence of Sir Thomas G. Carmichael, poverty in
    its sterner features is not seen. The general fare of our peasantry,
    though plain, is agreeable and wholesome: and having in a rea-
    sonable degree the means of subsistence, and being enabled to
    clothe themselves in decent apparel, they show themselves con-
    tented with their condition and circumstances. They are at the
    same time cleanly in their habits, orderly in their department, and
    attentive to the observances, while many of them, I trust, are ac-  
    quainted with the power, of religion.
	During the last three years there has not been a single illegi-
    timate birth in the parish.
