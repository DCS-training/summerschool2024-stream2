   Church, Stipend, School, Poor, &c.-The church is an old
building 90 feet in length within the walls, and 22 feet
wide.  It was repaired in 1776, at which time the session
gave L. 20 for liberty to erect a loft or gallery in the west
end, the seats of which they let at a moderate rent, for the
benefit of the poor, for which they draw about 10 per cent.
for their money.  There is an old desk in the church,
erected by one Watson in 1502, which is still quite fresh
and sound.  It is now one of the best and most commodi-
ous old churches in the county.-The manse was built in
1762, but the offices stand greatly in need of repairs.  The
stipend was augmented in 1783, and is 1000 merks, in-
cluding communion-element-money, and 6 chalders of
victual, one of which is bear.  The glebe is small, and in
4 different parcels.  Patron, General Gordon.  Near the
church, on the banks of the Ithan, are the ruins of a priory,
said to be founded by Fergus Earl of Buchan, in the year
1179, and his donation of it to the Abbacy of Arbroath
was afterwards confirmed by Margaret, Countess of Bu-
chan, his daughter, who married Sir William Cumming,
Knt. who, by that marriage, became Earl of Buchan.
From the appearance of the foundations, which were ex-
tant some years ago, it should seem to have been 3 sides of
a court, the middle of which was the church, and the
2 sides the cells and offices of the monks.  It does not seem
to have been richly endowed, for the lands that belonged
to it in this neighbourhood, amount only to L. 200 Ster.
of rent at this day.-To the west of the church is the parish-
school, which in summer is generally attended by about 30
children, and 40 in winter.  The salary is paid to the ma-
ster in meal, by the farmers and crofters, which he is obliged
to collect, and amounts (if exactly paid) to 12 bolls of meal
annually.  The fees of the scholars are low.  He has L. 2
as session-clerk; and here, it is but justice to observe, that
