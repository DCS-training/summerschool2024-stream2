   Face of the Country.-The parish may be divided into three
districts The tract of country lying between the Cowie and
Carron from the coast, about 3 miles to the W., has a rich
and fertile appearance.  Close to this district, stands the man-
sion-house of Mr. Barclay of Urie, on a rising ground near
the river Cowie, the sloping banks of which are planted with
trees towering one above another.  This plantation which
extends an English mile to the W., and as far to the E. of
the house, on both sides of the river, presents a most de-

tances, neat commodious dwelling-houses of stone and lime,
and covered with states, are built by the proprietor, Mr. Bar-

show the rapid progress of improvement in this place.  A-
bout two miles S. W. from Urie, is the mansion-house of
Fetteresso, formerly the residence of the ancient and noble

warm, and surrounded with fine old trees, which, together
with the adjoining improved fields, exhibit a beautiful ap-
