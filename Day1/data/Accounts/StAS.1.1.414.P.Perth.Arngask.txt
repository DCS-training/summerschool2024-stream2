     NUMBER XLII.

     PARISH OF ARNGASK.

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM LANG.

     Name, Situation, Extent, and Soil.

   THE antient as well as the modern name given to this
parish is Arngask.  The name of the farm which in-
cludes the hill on which the church stands, is the same
with that of the parish.  From this farm the parish proba-
bly derived its name, which is descriptive of the nature of
the parish, and is entirely composed of hills.  It is com-
pounded of Arn, which is probably derived from the Latin
word Arvum, and gask, which is commonly understood to
signify what is large.  Arngask may hence signify elevated
or large arable land; and, in truth, the hills in this parish
are almost all capable of culture.  The parish is in the pres-
bytery of Perth, and the synod of Perth and Stirling.  It is
nearly of a circular form, and about 4 miles in diameter.  It
is bounded by the parishes and Strathmiglo, Abernethy, Dron,
Forgandenny, Forteviot, and Orwel.  In this parish there is
a considerable variety of soil.  Upon some of the hills it is
light and shallow; but there are several banks of very rich
fertile ground, capable of producing almost any crop.  The
hills are generally green, and afford excellent pasture.  There
is more land in pasture than in tillage in this parish.  There
