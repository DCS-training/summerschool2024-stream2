settled permanently in Galloway; and they have left but few me-
morials, even in the bestowing Saxon names upon places, of their
ever having gained a footing here at all. Not so with the Irish
emigrants, who, after many attacks on the Romanized Britons,
before the end of the ninth century, succeeded in gaining posses-
sion of Galloway, and at length of the whole peninsula formed by
the river and Frith of the Clyde on the other. In the topography of
the stewartry, these colonists have left innumerable proofs of the
number of their settlements. Many of the names of places alluded
to, indeed, are small hill; Dungyle, from the British din or the Irirh
dun, a fort; and Bengairn, from bdn, a mountain, and cairn, a
hillock of stones; yet the complete colonization of Galloway by
the Irish is strikingly proved by the fact, that in this whole parish
only two places retain named which are purely British, viz. Slag-
naw, a compotnd of slack, the name of a burn, and cnol, commonly
pronounced knowe, a hillock; and Carlinwark, from the British
caer-lin, the fort-lake, and the tautological Scoto-Saxon wark, a
castle or large structure of any kind. The name of Kirk-cormic,
or rather Kil-cormic, as it was formerly written, one of the three
parishes of which Kelton is composed, is purely Irish, kil signify-
ing a church, and Ulster Annals Saint Patrick's heir. For many
ages, this people predominated in Galloway, speaking their own
language, having their own officers, called reguli or kings, being
governed by their own laws, and retaining their national manners
and customs, even to the point of rebellion whenever they were
attempted to be interfered with, as was the case in the Galwe-
gians, as described by Symson in 1684, shew a great resemblance
to the peculiarities of the Irish peasantry at the present day; but
recent improvements, and increased facilities of intercourse, have
changed the habits and customs of the people, and assimilated their
modes of life to the Scottish national standard.
	It would be foreign to the object of a work like the present to
pursue the civil history of this parish, mixed up as it is with that
of the district through all the desolating feuds of its native lords;
the wars that originated in the disputed succession tot he throne
of Scotland, in which the Galwegians naturally took part with
their countrymen the Comyns and Baliols, and consequently shared
