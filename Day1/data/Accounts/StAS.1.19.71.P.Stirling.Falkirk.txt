     NUMBER II.

     PARISH OF FALKIRK,

     (COUNTY OF STIRLING, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN AND TWEED-
     DALE, PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW),

     By JAMES WILSON, M.A.  Minister of the Parish.

     Boundaries, and general Description.
   THE parish of Falkirk is between 7 and 8 miles in
length from E. to W. and in some parts more than
4 miles in breadth.  It is bounded on the E. by the frith
of Forth and the parish of Polmont; on the S. by the pa-
rishes of Polmont and Slamannan; on the W. by Cumber-
nauld and Denny; and on the N. by the river Carron,
which separates it from the united parishes of Larbert and
Dunipace.  By the changes which the course of this river
has undergone, a few houses belonging to this parish are
now on the Larbert side; and a few, which are connected
with that parish, are on the Falkirk side of the river.
