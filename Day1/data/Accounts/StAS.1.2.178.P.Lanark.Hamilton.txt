     Statistical Account

   Surface and Soil.-Along the Clyde lie extensive vallies of
a deep and fertile soil.  Thence the land rises gradually every-
where to the south-west, to a considerable height; in the
highest parts being about 600 feet above the level of the sea;
but without forming itself into any hill, or becoming remarka-
bly uneven.  The soil of the rising ground is mostly of a day-
ish nature.  The lower parts of the ascent are tolerably fertile,
and well cultivated; but from the nature of the soil and bot-
tom, the crops are seldom early.  The highest parts often
produce scanty, and always late crops.  The surface, not being
broken by any great irregularities, he land is all arable, except
some sleep banks by the sides of the rivers and brooks, a few
swampy meadows in the upper part of the parish, and such
parts as are covered with planting or natural wood, the ex-
tent or which is still considerable; though much ground, for-
merly covered with wood, has been converted into corn-
fields.

   Rivers.-Besides the Clyde, already mentioned, a smaller ri-

near four miles through the parish, empties itself into the Clyde
near the town.  The banks of the Avon, as it passes through
the Duke of Hamilton's park, are high and bold; and, being
covered with wood of various kinds, having different tints of
foliage, are extremely picturesque, forming a fine contract
with the plains below.  There are several other small streams,
the banks of which are well wooded in the low ground, but
naked towards their sources in the upper country.
   Salmon, trout, pike, perch, roach, lampreys, silver eels,
and small flounders, are found in there streams and rivers; but
no kind of fish in great abundance, excepting the minnew.
The quantity of salmon, in particular, has much decreased
of late years.  The number of fry killed by anglers, great
