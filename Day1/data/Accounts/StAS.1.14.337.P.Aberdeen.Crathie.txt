     Of Crathy and Braemar.

   Forests, Wood, &c.- The greater part of the united
parishes of Crathy and Braemar, have been originally
King's forest, and known by the name of the Forest of
Marr.  This forest, with those of the Duke of Atholl,
and Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld in Perthshire, and
the Duke of Gordon in Badenoch and Glenaven, consti-
tuted the principal part of the great northern Caledo-
nian forest.  In the deepest mosses or morasses, within
the immense range of extensive forests above mentioned,
there are to be found large logs, or roots of wood (even
where there is not a tree now to be seen standing), which
affords the most incontrovertible evidence, that they have
formerly been over-run with timber.
   The only part of the forest of Marr, which is now
used as kept forest, is in Braemar.  The Earl of Fife
and Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld, have, each of them,
extensive forests, which are well stocked with red and
roe deer.  From the great care and attention which has
been paid to these animals for some years past, they are
now so numerous and domesticated, that they are to be
seen in numbers from the windows of the houses of In-
vercauld and Marr-Lodge.  At the latter place, about the
beginning of May, 100 stags have been seen at once
feeding on the lawn.  The soil of this country, in gene-
ral, is favourable to the growth of forest trees.  Be-
sides birch, a kind of poplar, known by the name of
quaking ash, the alder, the roan tree, or mountain ash, a
species of the willow, etc. etc.  There are, in these pa-
rishes, extensive natural fir woods, belonging to the Earl
of Fife, Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld, Mr. Gordon of
Abergeldie, and Mr. Farquharson of Inverey; as also,
large plantations of Scotch firs, and other trees.  Mr.
Farquharson of Invercauld alone has planted above 14
