  PRESBYTERY OF STIRLING, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

          THE REV. ANDREW BROWN, MINISTER. *

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.-THE name of this parish in ancient records is written
Alueth, Alvath, or Alveth: this last mode of spelling is to be
seen upon a tomb-stone in the church yard, dated A.D. 1632.
The word is doubtless of Gaelic origin, and is probably from Ail-
bbeach, rocky, an epithet very characteristic of the hills around.
The present spelling, Alva, has been in use since the beginning
of last century.
  Situation, Boundaries, Extent, &c.-barony or parish be-
longed, in ancient times, to Clackmannanshire; but since the begin-
ning of the seventeenth century, has been attached to Stirlingshire,
although upwards of four miles distant from the nearest point of the
latter county. Since the passing of the Reform Bill, Alva has been
politically incorporated with Clackmannan but is still absurdly con-
nected with the county of Stirling, for judicial purposes. It is sur-
rounded, on all sides, by the shire of Clackmannan, except on the
north, where it is bounded by a part of Perthshire. Tillicoultry
