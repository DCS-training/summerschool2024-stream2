   Circumstances and Character.-The people are nearly of one
class and condition.  Their way of living arises, either whol-
ly or in great part, from the culture of the ground.  Their
manners are suitable to their condition.  Most of the farm-

hard labour, frugality, and attention of the present genera-
tion.  They have not laid aside those good habits.  With
few exceptions, they are distinguished for integrity, sobriety,
and diligence.  Acting from a sense of their relation to their
Maker, they are, of course, punctual and serious in perform-
ing the duties of religion.  Their devotion, too, is of a ra-
tional, tolerant nature, not breaking out into heats against
those who entertain different opinions, but manifesting itself
