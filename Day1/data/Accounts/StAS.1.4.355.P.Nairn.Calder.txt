very industrious in their way.  Their great industry in the
summer, lies in preparing dunghills and their fuel, and in
winter, in threshing out and milling their corns.-There is
no established manufacture in the parish, but still a great
deal of work is done in the web-way in their families, both

offices, and the like, when they leave their employment;
to all day-labourers, adventurers, handicraftsmen, and o-
