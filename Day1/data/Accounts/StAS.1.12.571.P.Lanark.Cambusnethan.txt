elusive of the rent paid for coal and iron-stone, which is only
143 L.  The rate of seus the rood is, in general, 10 s. a-year.

   Fences and Orchards.-Thorn-hedges are generally pre-
ferred, but as the nature of the foil exposes them to the dan-
ger of becoming fogged, it has been found necessary to have
the mound, in which the thorns are inserted, highly raised and
enriched with dung.  The strongest clay is preferred for or-
chard ground.  On an average, the annual value of the fruit
raised on an acre of land, is supposed to amount to 10 l. Ster-
ling.  When we reckon, along with this sum, the value of
the undergrowth, which is little short of what the land would
yield, if cultivated in the ordinary way, still more, when
consider that fruit-trees thrive belt on those inaccessible spots
which could not be employed advantageously in raising any
other produce, we shall be sensible of the great profit to be de-
rived from this way of employing land, where the soil and
climate are favourable A profitable orchard has a large pro-
portion of pear-trees.

   Minerals, etc.-There is abundance of excellent coal, ca-
pable of being wrought with great ease: It is, therefore, ex-
tremely probable, that the proposed canal between Edin-
burgh and Glasgow, will have its course through this parish.
The price of 8 cwt. of coal, is 1 s. 6 d.  The colliers have;
in general, half the coal put out, as wages.  Many of the
colliers employed here, betook themselves to their disagree-
able labour at an advanced period of life; but they abundant-
ly compensate for their want of regular training, by, their so-
briety and diligence.  In this, as well as in all the neigh-
bouring parishes, there are great quantities of iron-stone.
There is likewise abundance of free-stone.  As the materials
for making roads are very bad, it requires, constant attention,
and great expense to keep the roads in proper repair.
