flicted this coast with their ravages.  From one of these
mounds, on the top of a small hill near Boydston, bones were

   Price of Labour and Provisions.-The wages given to do-
mestic servants vary, according to their age, strength, and
abilities.  A good plowman receives 4 l. Sterling; a boy ca-
pable of driving a plough or cart, a guinea; female servants
from 15 s. to 35 s. for half a year's service.  A journeyman
mason receives 22 d. per day in Summer, 20 d. in Winter;
a wright 1 s. 6 d.; a ship's carpenter 2 s.; common labourers
from 16 d. to 1 s. a day.  There being no market day, or
market place, the supply and price of provisions are variable.
The prices are pretty much regulated by the next market
town (Irvine), though in general higher.  Great quantities
of meal and oats are sometimes imported from the coast
of Galloway.  This renders these commodities sometimes
cheaper here than in inland towns; but in years of scarcity,
such importation ceases they must be dearer.  In the Win-
ter reason, rabbits are sold without the skin at 7 d. a pair.
It is singular, that in a country so populous and close by the
sea, none think of making fishing a business, especially as fish
are to be found in great quantities on the coast of Arran,
and could never fail of finding a ready market.  The inha-
bitants of Ayr long laboured under the same inconveniency,
till a colony of fishermen from the North settled in that
place.  In the course of a few years there have enriched
themselves, and continue to supply the town and neighbour-
hood of Ayr at a moderate rate.  Saltcoats is a still more
likely place for a colony of the fame profession to succeed;
