   Agriculture, etc.-The general rule of farming is, to have
one-third of the land in tillage, and two-thirds in pasture.
Oats, barley, and pease, are the grains generally raised.  Po-
tatoes have been long cultivated with much success.  Wheat
has not succeeded, unless with a few, though the soil is very 
like that of Hertfordshire.  The parish does not only supply
itself, but exports a large quantity of grain and potatoes to
London, Liverpool, Dublin, the Isle of Man, and the West
of Scotland.  Every field having produced its number of
crops, is laid down with red, white, or yellow clovers, rib, or
rye grass seeds.  The seed time commences in the beginning
of March, and the harvest about the middle of August.
