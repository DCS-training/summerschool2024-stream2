   Battle of Preston.-On the east of the inclosures of Preston
was sought the battle of Preston, A.D, 1745, in which the
army of the Rebels obtained the victory over the King's for-

Gladsmuir is at least 3 miles distant from the scene of action.

was to be fought on the Moor of the Gledes, which, in the
