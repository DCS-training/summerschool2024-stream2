in the parish, are by the generosity of Mr. Brodie, former-
ly mentioned, furnished with the means of having their chil-
dren properly educated, who has, for a considerable time past,
sent annually to the schoolmaster 51. 58. for educating the
poor children in the parish; which, as it furnishes the means
of instruction to such as might either be deprived of it, or
who might enjoy it in a more sparing manner, is a very con-
siderable advantage, and must redound to the honour of the
liberal contributor.  No instances are known of any being
banished from the parish, nor of any who have left it for mis-
conduct of any kind.  There is not one of them but what is
a native of Scotland.

   School.-At an average, there are 30 scholars who may be
taught english, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping.  The
teacher can also teach mensuration.  The greatest number of
his scholars, are such as are learning english. For a country
schoolmaster, he has an exceeding good hand of writing,
and teaches both arithmetic and book-keeping very well:
though few of his scholars are able to attend so long as to
feel much benefit by his accomplishments.  The emoluments
of his office are very scanty, and no way adequate to his use-
fulness, which, though no partial evil to that race of men,
renders it the more to be regretted.  He receives 6 L. from the
heritors, 5 L. 5 s. from Mr. Brodie; the fees arising from the
office of session-clerk, annually may amount to 1 L. Ios.
He has likewise a free house and garden.  As a considerable
number of his scholars are upon the charity, the school-
wages are no great matter, being but a perfect trifle a-quar-
ter.  As a precentor, he is very well qualified for his office.
His whole emoluments can hardly exceed 20 L., and with that,
by great economy, he supports decently, a wife and 5 small
children.
