property of the late active and gallant Sir John Ross of
Balnagown, whom the narrator has often heard say, that
he would soon drive his carriage to Kan-loch-elsh, which
could be easily effected, there being no bog nor mire in the
tract of these few miles, only stones of such bulk as might

which projects into the ocean considerably more than the
opposite northern coast of Edrachilish, the Kilis may be
found in length+ six leagues at least, as it terminates at the

though he wrote the factor in 1792.  It was locked up where there was
no access to it; therefore all calculations or reckoning condescended on
are but the narrator's best conjectures.
