linen.  They are sometimes distressed with fluxes, occasioned
by their feeding mostly on potatoes.  They are most subject
to them in the latter end of spring, and beginning of sum-
mer, when the potatoes have a tendency to grow, and when
the people have neither milk, meal, nor onions to eat with
them.  This year, and the last, there was a putrid fever,
which made prodigious havoc in a place called Strathbran,
where it carried off more than two thirds of the inhabitants,
and still continues to rage with violence there.  It is found
to be very infections; and its having done so much damage
in that place is attributed to the unwholesomeness of the air,
which has been worse this year than ever, owing to the ex-
tensive flat in that strath being repeatedly overflowed in the
summer and harvest months, and the stagnated putrid waters
sending forth noxious vapours that poison the air.

   Lakers.-There are many lakes and rivers, all of which
abound with fish of one kind or other, though none draws a
price but salmon, being at a great distance from any market
town, and of no such consideration as to encourage an ad-
venturer to try what could be made of them.-The most re-
markable lakes are Loch-Achilty, where the char and silver
trout are sometimes found.  One thing remarkable to be ob-
served of this lake is, that there is no visible running water
issuing from it except at the time of high speats, although a
great quantity falls into it daily, it certainly discharges it-
self by subterraneous passages into the river Rasay, to the
west of which it lies about three quarters of a mile.  It is a
mile long; in some places very deep.  The water is beauti-
fully clear: It has an artificial island, a place made for safety,
where the ruins of a house and garden are still to be seen.
The access is by a draw-bridge.  The last possessor's name
