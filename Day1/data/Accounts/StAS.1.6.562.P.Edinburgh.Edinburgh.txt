   In the old town of Edinburgh             31,122
   In the Canongate                          4,500
   In St. Cuthberts or West-church Parish   12,168
   In South Leith                            7,200
   In North Leith                            2,205

   The computation made by Mr. Arnot in 1775, was still
more considerable.  The number of families in Edinburgh,
Leith, and the environs, he states, amounted to 13,806, which,
multiplied by 6, makes the number of inhabitants to be 82,836,
and to this he propeses to add 1400 for the castle, hospitals,
& c. amounting in all to 84,236.  But 6 to a family is too high
a calculation even for Edinburgh, large as the families there are.
Reckoning at the rate of 5 to each family, which, it appears from
the enumeration in 1791, is sufficiently high, and adding 1400
for the castle & c. the number of fouls in the city and suburbs,
including Leith, amounted in 1775 to 70,430
   Soon after the Statistical Account of Scotland was set on
foot, the ministers and elders of six parishes of the city of E-
dinburgh, (the High Church, Old Church, Little Church,
Lady Yester's, Old-Grayfriars, and St. Andrew's), and the pa-
rishes of St. Cuthberts, South Leith, and North Leith, with
the view of promoting this work, made an enumeration of the
inhabitants within their respective bounds.  The numbers in
six of the ten parishes of Edinburgh being in this manner ac-
tually ascertained, sufficient data were from thence assorded
for estimating the numbers of families, and of individuals,
in the remaining four parishes; and the result of this enu-
meration and calculation is exhibited in the following Table
of the Population of Edinburgh and its environs in 1791.
