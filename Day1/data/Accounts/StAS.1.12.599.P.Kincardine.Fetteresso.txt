300 barren, covered with short heath, furze, and broom;
The land was improved in this manner, by clearing it of
stones, many of which were split by gunpowder, draining,
levelling, and enclosing, chiefly with thorn hedges.

   "Mode of Cropping.-First year, fallowed and improved
by lime; 50 bolls of Scotch shells, water measure, to each
acre; 4 firlots to each boll, and 34 Scotch pints to each firlot.
The lime ploughed into the land before winter, and some-
times the land was ploughed a second time before it.  The
first crop oats or barley.  Second year, dunged, and sown with
turnips, in broad cast, and hoed while any weeds appeared.
The turnips sometimes fed off by sheep, but most commonly
one half drawn, and the other half fed off in alternate ridges,
the whole ground being included in the sold.  Third year,
barley and grass-seeds.  If intended to be broken up for
wheat, 12 pound of broad clover, and 2 pecks of rye-grass
to each acre.  If intended to remain for pasture, a greater
quantity of rye-grass, with the addition of 6 pound of white,
and 6 pound of yellow clover, and 4 pound of rib grass to
each acre.  That part of the land proposed for grain, was
folded the first or second year of the grass, and ploughed up
for wheat or oats, which were succeeded by turnips; and the
above course continued.
   "Mr. Barclay has planted about 800 acres with Scotch firs,
great part of which are since filled up with oak, ash, beech,
and larix.  His tenants* in the parish have also improved
nearly the same quantity of land which he himself has done.
and follow, in general, almost the same mode of cropping.
Twenty-two wheel-ploughs are at this time at work upon
and those farms.  The farm houses and offices are built of strong
