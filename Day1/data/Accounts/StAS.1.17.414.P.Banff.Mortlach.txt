the north; and several of these, it is not unlikely, are the
offspring of the mother church.  It is in the county of Banff,
in the Commissariot of Aberdeen, and in the province of Mo-
ray; lying nearly 5o miles to the westward, but a little to the
north, from the city of Aberdeen, and about 30 south west
from the town of Banff, the capital of the shire.  Since the
1706, it has been, by an act of the General Assembly, in the
presbytery of Strathbogie and synod of Moray: Before that
time, it was in the presbytery of Fordyce and synod of Aber-
deen: And in a connection with Fordyce, the mimster of
Mortlach, it is said, has still a vote for delegates, from that
presbytery, to elect the professors of Divinity of King's College
of Aberdeen, and has also some trust and management in cer-
tain lands or sums of money bequeathed to that universi-
ty.

   Extent, etc.-The form of the parish is irregular, and not
easily described, so as to be understood.  The best idea of it
would be obtained by a map from actual servey.  Its greatest
length from the head of Glenrinnes to the opposite end near
the Spey, that is from south to north, is eleven or twelve En-
glish miles; and its greater breadth from the banks of Do-
veron to the foot of Belrinnes, that is from east to west, may
be about as much.  It consists of the lands of Edinglassie and
Glenmarky, which are Lord Fife's,-of the Lordship of Au-
chindown, Glenfiddich, and the greater part of Glenrinnes,
the Duke of Gordon's,-of Dullanside and a part of tile
Lordship of Balveny, Lord Fife's again,-and of the barony
of Kinninvie, which is, and for centuries has been, in the
possession of a branch of the old family of Balquhan, and of
which James Leslie, Esq; the only residing heritor, is the pre-
sent laird, and makes a very good one, being kind to his te-
nants, an honest hospitable gentleman, and an excellent.
