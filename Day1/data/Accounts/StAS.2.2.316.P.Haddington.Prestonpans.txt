affecting and disgusting description. At a very early hour in the
morning, after a night of. drunkenness and riot, mothers of fami-
lies might be seen hurrying with steps as rapid as if their immor-
tal destinies depended on their speed, with vessels containing gallons
of spirits, but partially, if at all concealed. At a later hour, wither-
ed-looking children, scarcely escaped from the bonds of help-
less infancy, might be witnessed passing to and for amid the
severities of the wintry storm, in fearful ministry to the cruel and
remorseless passions of their benighted and ruined parents. From
the closing hours of the preceding evening, until the midnight
darkness of the day of God, the peace of the community was ever
at stake. The coarse shout of brutal merriment the vicious
and vulgar oath,-the shriek of fear bursting from woman's lips,
-the appalling sounds of injury and violence,-all these might
be heard issuing from dwellings, where not only men and women,
but little children, would be found swelling with hoarse notes the
confused din and disturbance.
   A proposal for discontinuing the sale of spirits on the Lord's day
having been made, it was, upon the whole, most favourably re-
ceived by the dealers; who entered unanimously into a formal re-
solution against the practice. This resolution is now universally
adhered to; and its effects have been most beneficial.

     April 1839.
