   Proprietors, Rents, and Improvements.-None of the pro-
prietors reside in the parish.  A few remains of the very an-

wildest slate of ravage and of Gothic desolation; and which,
whether restored according to their former constitution, or

successors.  There is a small farm in this parish, of 17 acres,
belonging to the kirk-session of Ely, a considerable village
about 5 miles S of this; and there are 4 feuers in it, whose
feu-duty, to Miss Scott of Scotstarvet, for about 12 acres
of pretty good ground, is 5 L. 2 s. 4 1/2 d. Within less than 30

of a considerable estate in it, little more than 20 years ago,
was only 196 L. per annum, though now it draws no less than

much as possible, however, this inconvenience, the parishioner are far from be-
ing despicable menders of shoes.  The circumstance of being, at the nearest,' 3 
makes distant from any makers, has taught them this article of ingenuity.
