                IV.-INDUSTRY.
     The number of imperial acres may, in round numbers, be stated
at 13500; of these about 8000 are either cultivated or occa-
sion.wlly in tillage; and from 600 to 700 in plantations, gardens,
&c. The remainin- 500 acres are almost in a state of nature,
and, from lying principally along the heights and declivities of the
Oebils, cannot be cultivated, at least with profit.
     Larcb, Scotch fir, spruce, asb, and oak, are the principal trees.
     Little attention is paid to the regular yearly tbinning, felling, prun-
ing, &C.
     The arable land ma average about L. 1, I Os. or L. 1, 12s.
per imperial acre. The average rate of grazing is from L. 3, ]Os.
to L. 4 per annum for a cow, and L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 for an ox.
     Wages.-Farm-servants in bothy receive about L. 12 in modey,
61/2 bolls of oatmeal, and 6 firlots of potatoes per annum, with a
pint of milk daily. The married servants generally have cows, but
their wages are lessened in proportion. The rate of labour is very
various; in summer a stout and good workman will earn 2s. per day
(providing his own victual) ; or, during the hay harvest, 2s. 6d.
In winter Is. 6d. hs a common rate. - Women obtain from 9d.
to I s. 3d.
     Live-Stock.-The Fife breed of black cattle is generally pre-
ferred, though in its pure state can hardly be obtained.

<FOOTNOTE> The number of Scots acrs, as given by the writer of the former Statistical Ac-
count, was incorrecti or, if we take his own statement as to the number of miles
viz. a or 6 long, and 6 broad, this would give at the utmost 30 square miles, or
15.200 Scots acre& By careful measurement on a map, the num6er of imperial
acres given above will be found tolerably accurate.
