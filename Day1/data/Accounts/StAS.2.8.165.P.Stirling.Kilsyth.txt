The small collections at the evening exercise, lately begun in the
winter season in church, are applied towards furnishing such child-
ren with Bibles or Testaments. At Banton the school and school-
master's house have been rebuilt by subscription. They are
very substantial and commodious. In the immediate vicinity of
the town of Kilsyth, a new school and schoolmaster's house have
been erected, on a handsome and commodious plan,--Sir Archi-
bald Edmonstone, Bart. having liberally given the ground, and the
rest of the heritors paying their proportion of the expense of the
building. A good many children are taught gratis, the heritors
and session, at the recommendation of the minister and session,
paying the teacher a modified payment for a considerable number
of children of poor or dissipated parents. Notwithstanding of this
liberality, too many are very imperfectly taught; the poverty, or
shameful recklessness of the parents tempting them to apprentice
the poor children at the early ages of eight, nine, and ten! In this
case, the children are apt to lose soon the little they have learnt.
In some cases, they attend an evening school by way of redeem-
ing time; but this is a very partial remedy, and often not improved.
   The intellectual system of mental and moral tuition has been
practised here, for eight or ten years past, with considerable spirit
and success.
   There are usually, in the town, two schools on the teachers' own
adventure. One of these, in connection with the Relief, has, for
two years, had a kind of endowment from a wealthy member of that
body,--tbe teacher being bound to give schooling to the poor of the
Relief persuasion, either gratis, or for a small payment. In the East
Barony, there is a female teacher, who has generally about forty
scholars, whom she is very assiduous and successful instructing.
   Nearly 500 scholars are in regular course of instruction at the
schools of this parish. The week-day evening classes succeed
well. In the parochial school in the town, there are II Latin
scholars, 2 Greek, and 5 French.
   Savings Bank.--A savings bank was opened in September
1829: and the following statement will show what measure of suc-
cess has attended it.
