number of ploughs is about 80, and that of carts about
160.
   The black-cattle consist partly of the small ancient
breed, but mostly of a mixed breed between that and the
Cunningham kind.  About two-thirds are milch-cows,
and the rest young cattle, rearing for the same purpose.
Very few are reared or fed directly for the purpose of
slaughter.  Several of the tenants have removed to this pa-
rish from the parish of Dunlop, or its neighbourhood; the
art of making Dunlop cheese is now, therefore, generally
and well understood.  It is only within these 10 or 12 years,
however, that this species of manufacture was much prac-
tised in this parish.  The average produce of butter from
each cow is 2 1/2 stone, and of cheese 8 stone; about two-thirds
of which is of the sweet-milk, or Dunlop kind.  From these
data, a pretty corect estimate of the produce of the milch-
cows in the parish may be easily formed.  This produce is
sold partly to the shopkeepers and private families in the
neighbouring villages, and partly to those in Glasgow.  With-
in these few years, some of the farmers have begun to feed
a pig or two, with whey in summer, and with potatoes and
a little oat-meal in winter.  As this kind of stock is found
to be profitable, it will probably soon become an object of
more general attention.
   Potatoes constitute a very large proportion of the food of
the inhabitants.  Almost every family raises them for its
own use; and the occupiers of land have lately begun to
raise them also for the purpose of feeding horses and cattle,
particularly milch-cows, a practice which is found to be
highly advantageous.  The inhabitants of the villages, and
others, who possess no land for raising potatoes, take a piece
of ground from some of the nearest proprietors or farmers,
at the rate of 6 d. per fall, beside furnishing a reasonable
quantity of dung. These pieces of ground they cultivate
