   Husbandry.-The mode of husbandry is not uniform
throughout the parish; but that which prevails most is,
after liming the ground to take 2, sometimes 3 crops of
oats, after these a green crop of potatoes, turnips, and
pease, and then to lay it out with barley, or bear and grass.
The quantity of ground occupied by each of these kinds of
crop is not exactly ascertained, but is conjectured to be
about 1500 acres in oats; from 20 to 30 in wheat; 130
in barley; 70 in bearl; 120 in potatoes; 30 or 40 in tur-
nips; 40 or 50 in pease; and about 200 in clover and rye-
grass.  The potatoes and turnips are all horse-hoed, and
in no country are better crops of these raised than in this.
Potatoes are supposed to be half the food of the labouring
people through all this country; and when there are more
than can be used by the people, they are found to be of
great advantage in feeding horses, cows, and swine; hence 
the raising good potatoe crops is an object of importance, 
and if the farmers of this country have approached perfec-
tion in any thing, it is in this branch of husbandry.  The 
nature of the soil is well adapted to this kind of crop, and

proprietor's own hand; from which it appears, that there were then upon 
that barony 6740 sheep, yielding 537 stones of wool.  The number kept 
at present upon the same lands is only 3960, which, allowing 3 stones of 
wool to the score of sheep, will yield 594 stones; so that though the 
number of sheep be less by almost two-fifths, yet the quantity of wool is
greater.  The reason of this remarkable difference in the number of sheep 
is, that at the beginning of this century the sheep were much smaller, con-
sequently the lands could keep more of them; besides, the farmers then 
overstocked their farms; and a third reason is, that a great deal of land, 
which was then sit only for common sheep-pasture, has since been im-
proved, and is now good corn-land.  Farms, upon which at that time
considerable stocks were kept, have not now a single sheep upon them.
The disproportion with respect to the quantity of wool may be accounted
far from the larger size of the sheep, from their being in better condi-
tion and from their being heavier smeared than they formerly were.
