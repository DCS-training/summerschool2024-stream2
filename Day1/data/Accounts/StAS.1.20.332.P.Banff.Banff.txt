enlarged and improved.  It occupies between 15 and 20 
acres, and contains all the variety of fruit and forest trees,
ever-green and flowering shrubs, flower roots and plants, 
which are in demand in this climate.
   A gentleman in this neighbourhood, Mr Garden of
Troup, in the course of three or four years, has planted
from Mr Reid's nursery, the immense number of on mil-
lion nine hundred thousand trees, besides what he procured
from other quarters, and the greater part in a thriving
state*.

   Woods, etc,-It is generally supposed, that a considerable
part of this parish, towards the south-west, has been covered
with woods, and belonged to the ancient forest of Boin.
A simple distich, which tradition has handed down, con-
firms this opinion:
     From Culbirnie+ to the sea,
     You may step from tree to tree.

   There is still in possession of a farmer in that quarter, an
oak tree, 30 feet long, which was dug up in the neighbour-
hood of this farm;
   Since the decay or demolition of that forest, there were
very few trees in this district, till the year 1756, when Lord
Fife began his plantations.  These are now of great extent
and variety, an din a flourishing state.
   The woods on Lord Findlater's estates in this parish are
likwise thriving, and considerable extent.
   All these plantations add greatly to the decoration of
the country, to the comfort of the poor, and to the facility
of every branch of industry.
