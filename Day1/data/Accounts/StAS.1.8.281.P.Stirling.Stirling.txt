sanction to this, is uncertain.  A manse was bequeathed to
the minister of the first charge, during the last century, by a
Colonel EDMOND, who was a native of Stirling, and who, af-

procured through the interest of the town, is vested in the
first minister only, during life.

scholars is annually about 100.  There are two established
