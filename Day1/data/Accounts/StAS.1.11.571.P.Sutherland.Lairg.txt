Shinness.  There is also, at the side of the loch, below Shin-
ness, the end of a large vein of lime-stone.

   Population.-Though the face of the parish is very exten-
sive, the end it is but thinly inhabited.  There has been, however, a
considerable increase within these 50 years.

   Cattle and Produce.-Cows and horses cannot well be num-
bered, as the people's whole stock lies in them, excepting a
few sheep and goats.  They always buy a great deal of grain,
the land not producing above 8 months bread for the inhabi-
tants; for it is much more calculated for breeding cattle than
for yielding corn.  The only crops are, oats, barley, and po-
tatoes, and these in scanty portions, as the land is mostly all
let to small tenants, who have neither inclination nor ability
to improve their farms.

   Rent.-The rent of this, as well as of the parishes in the
neighbourhood, is a deep arcanum, known only to factors,
who (it should seem) think, that if the clergy or the public
were let into the secret, they would, by some legerdemain or
other, deprive them of the handling of it, or their constitu-
ents of the use.  It is calculated, however, that the gross rent
does not exceed 550 L. or 600 L. Sterling.  The proprietors are
the Countess of Sutherland, Pointzfield, Achany, and Captain
Mathison, wadsetter of Shinness.
