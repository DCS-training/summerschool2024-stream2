go at the advanced age of 105; three men of the verge
of 100, and a sourth turned of 100, are now living; and
within these few years several of both sexes, from 80 to 90
years of age, have died in the full possession of all their men-
tal faculties.  This district is frequently visited by heavy rains,
but the moisture is quickly absorbed by the earth, which is
naturally dry.

   Rivers, Hills, Woods, etc.-In the parish are several rivers,
abounding with excellent trout; the most considerable are the
Aw, the Kinloss, and the Etie.  Near the mouth of the
former is a valuable salmon fishing, which yields a considera-

to any in Scotland.-The hills are mostly covered with grass:
the most remarkable is Cruachan Bean, one of the highest
mountains in Scotland, 13 or 14 computed miles in circum-
ference, affording excellent pasturage for black-cattle and
sheep.  It is very steep towards the N. E. and slopes gently
down on the S. but rises with an abrupt ascent towards
the summit, which is divided into two points, each
exactly resembling a sugar loaf.  The N. point is reckon-

prospect.  The sea-pink grows upon it, and sea-shells have
been found on the summit.-The parish abounds with na-
tural wood; and there are a few plantations of pines and
Scotch firs.  Every cutting of the wood is supposed, at a mo-
derate computaion, to yield the proprietors no less than
L. 15,000 or L. 16,000 sterling.  They consists of ash, birch,
hazel, and alder, but chiefly oak.  They abound with roes;
and, on one estate, fallow deer run wild in the woods, of a
much superior size and flavour to any of their species that are
confined in parks.  There is a forest in Glenetie, pretty well
stocked with red deer.  Foxes, hares, wild-cats, pole-cats,
