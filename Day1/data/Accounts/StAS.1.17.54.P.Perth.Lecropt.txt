   Heritors, Rent, etc.-The heritors are 5 in number, none
of whom reside within the parish.  More than one half of the
parish belongs to JAMES STIRLING, Esq; of Kier, whose re-
sidence has a commanding prospect on the Bank of Lecropt,
within a mile of the church.  This family has been long and
justly respected, by all ranks, for the qualities which adorn
human nature in the higher spheres of life.  They have em-
bellished the place of Kier, by well dressed lawns and exten-
sive plantations; they have given bread to the poor, in car-
rying on these improvements; and have, by their example
and influence, diffused a stile of husbandry and cultivation
through this country formerly unknown.  The number of
farms is 25; and their extent is from 40 to 100 acres each.
There are 7 pendicles, consisting of from 3 to 14 acres.  There
are 20 cottages, occupied by labourers and married servants.
The land in the Carse lets, on an average, at 20 s. the acre;
and the average rent of the up-land is 12 s.  The valued rent
of the parish is 2200 l. Scotch.  The real rent is not exactly
ascertained.
