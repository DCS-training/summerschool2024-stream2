poor returns, being commonly one boll of meal, i. e. 16 packs,
and a boll of seed corn.  Our great oats yield much better
returns, but become worse and worse every year after the se-
cond sowing; and, if new seed be not procured, in the
course of very few years degenerate to the quality of small
oats.  From a boll of barley, we generally get 4, 5, or 6 feeds,
and there are instances of good spots, well dressed and ma-
nured, returning 16.  From potatoes planted in lazybeds (which
used to be the general method throughout the parish) ten-
fold is reckoned a good return.  Some have of late begun to
raise them from the drill, from which great advantage is de-
rived, that method producing from 15 to 25 returns: It is
hoped this will soon be the general practice, as the people
are fond enough of their interest where their can see it.
Want of encouragement to inclose grounds for hay has hither-
to prevented the tacksmen from attempting to raise grass
from seeds.  Some attention to green crops would probably
be found more profitable in this climate than the inhabitants
are aware of.  This they may become sensible of in time; and
it takes time to introduce a new system into any country.

   Farms, Produce, and Stock.-The method of uniting farms
began long ago, and seems to be gaining ground in pro-
portion to the avidity for high rents, and the rage for sheep
stocks.  It may be questioned, whether the letting of land
in large tenements be not on the whole more proper for this
country, than the old method of setting it in small portions.
There is a much greater proportion of hill than of low
ground; and a tacksman occupying from 5000 to 7000 acres,
(of which there are instances in this parish) is much more
able than a number of poor people can be to carry on im-
provements, by building proper houses, making necessary in-
closures, and by introducing new modes of managing ground
