   Antiquities, Etc.-There are on a high rising ground in
the south part of the parish, traces of what the common
people call a Roman camp.  It consists of the remains of two
concentric circular earthen dykes, or mounds.  The inner-
most is about 67 yards in diameter.  Between the innermost
and the outermost is a space of about 15 feet.  There were
through the whole of this and the neighbouring parishes a
great number of vaults with strong doors.  Some of them, if
not the whole, had an appartment immediately above them
with a turnpike-stair leading to it.  A few of them still re-
main.  Vulgar report says, that the use of them was to keep
their cattle from the Annandale thieves or freebooters.  May
not this suggest the origin of many of those circular dykes,
the remains of which are called by the common people Ro-
man camps?  Freebooting in former times, under certain
circumstances, was by no means a disgraceful employment.
This rendered every precaution to preserve their property,
especially their cattle, highly necessary.

   Character of the Peopke.-The people, in general, are active
and industrious, especially in seed-time and harvest.  They
know, that, if there works were not carried on with uncom-
mon activity, they would lore the season of them, so variable
and uncertain is the weather hereabout; and in those times
of urgent necessity, but especially in harvest, they are peculi-
arly attentive to that apostolic direction, "Look not every
man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others," in its belt sense.  For, no sooner is any one's har
vest finished, than his shearers are immediately dispersed
among all those in his neighbourhood who have any corn to
cut down.  They are sober and oeconomical.
