     Statistical Account

   general assessment should certainly take place in this, and in e-
very other parish, as would affect the landlord and his tenant, in
some just proportion, according to their ability, whether in-

town, employed in making flour, meal, and barley.  One of
them is erected upon the sea, which comes into a bay, on the
north side of the estate of Rossend.  At an average it works the
