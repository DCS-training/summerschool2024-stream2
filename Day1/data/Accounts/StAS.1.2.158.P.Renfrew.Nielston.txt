This last mode will probably become the general practice in
Scotland.  In this very parish, the office of school-masters,
during the former master's time, was held only during the
pleasure of the majority of the heritors.

   Private Schools.-There are generally two private schools,
one in the east end, and the other in the west end of the pa-
rish; where the school-masters depend entirely on the number
and wages of their scholars, which are always in proportion
to their diligence and success in teaching.

   Inns and Alchouses.-There are not less than nineteen inns, or
ale-houses in this parish, and no fewer than eight of these in the
village of Nielston.  Houses of that description can be of no
benefit to the public, but in two respects, 1st, to accommo-
date public meetings, or private companies on necessary busi-
ness; or 2dly, to entertain travellers by day, and to lodge
them and their horses, when overtaken by night.  This last,
and not the least useful public benefit resulting from inns, per-
haps not four of the ninetcen are equal to.  A question then
arises, are the whole of the remaining fifteen necessary, or what
proportion of them is requisite for the public good?  The
reader must have already anticipated the answer that should
be given.

   State of the Poor.-During the last quarter of the year
1786, the number of persons on the poors roll, amounted to 30,
and, in the same quarter of the year 1790, to 34.  Some of
these are children; some aged; one of them satuous.  They
are supported by the collections at the church door, which, at
an average, seldom exceed 20 s weekly; and the interest of a small
capital, amounting to about L. 140 sterling, which is the
whole fund belonging to the parish; together with is 6 d. paid
