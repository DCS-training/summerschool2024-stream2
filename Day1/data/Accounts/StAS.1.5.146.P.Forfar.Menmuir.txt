     Statistical Account

   Situation, Extent, Surface and Soil.-This parish is situ-
ated in the shire of Forfar, in the presbytery of Brechin, and
Synod of Angus and Mearns.  It is rather more than 5
English miles in length, and about 2, at a medium, in
breadth.  The general appearance of the country is flat, e-
specially to the south and east, except the northern division
of the parish, which is hilly and covered with heath.  The
rest of the grounds, particularly on the slopes, are very fer-
tile:  The soil seems to be a sandy clay, not very deep, and
towards the water side sharper, with less loam and more gra-
vel intermixed.

   Climate and Distempers.-The air may be called healthy,
though, from the vicinity of the hills, it is cold, and very
often in the summer evenings after sun-set, there is a chilly
breeze from that quarter.  In the low lands it is rather mar-
shy, and the air is moister, which, with the nature of the
food, may encourage the scurvy and King's evil.  This
latter complaint, with the flow inflammatory fever, are the
prevailing distempers.  The disease called Sibbins, and de-
scribed some years ago by Dr Gilchrist, has made its ap-
pearance once or twice in this parish; and this distemper,
called, in the account of a neighbouring parish, the louping
gout, was first noticed here.

   Mineral Spring.-On a farm called Bathall there was a
mineral well, which was in considerable repute some years
ago; but is now very little resorted to.  It is of the chaly-
beate kind, and good for stomachic complaints.  But the
poor people in those diseases, for which Spa waters are re-
commended, commonly prefer that of Panana or Arbroath.

   Population.-The number of people in this parish, accor-
ding to Dr Webster's statement, amounts to 743.  By a
very correct list taken last spring, (1791,) there were 900
