                  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, &c.-The parish is said to have derived its name from
three Gaelic words, signifying the head or junction of the burn of
the Drums.
   Extent, &c.-The figure of the parish being very irregular, only
an approximation to its extent can be given. It may be said to
contain about 20 imperial square miles. It is bounded by the pa-
rishes of Kirriemuir and Cortachy on the north and east; by
Airlie, on the south; and by Lintrathen, on the west. The sur-

hills, which are themselves frequently indented. The banks of
Baldovie, Balfour, and Meikle Kenny present a very agreeable
appearance; while those adjoining to Pearsie, though less exten-

braes of Angus. Catlaw, the highest hill, rises to the height of
2264 feet above the level of the sea, from which may be had one
of the most extensive prospects in Scotland. The German Ocean,
from Montrose round to the Frith of Forth, great part of the
coast of Fife, the Bell-rock Lighthouse, Berwick Law, Arthur
Seat, together with some of the highest mountains in the Western
Highlands, are discernible. To the north may be observed some
of the loftiest mountains of the Grampian range.
  Meteorology.-The lower division of the parish is elevated about
600 feet above the level of the sea, from which it is about twenty-
four miles distant. The atmosphere is exceedingly dry and pure,
except in the neighbourhood of morasses, of which there are still
a few.
  Hydrography.-The parish is everywhere abundantly supplied
with water. The principal streams are the Prosen, Melgum or
