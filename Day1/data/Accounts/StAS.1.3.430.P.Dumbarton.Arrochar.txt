     PARISH OF ARROQUHAR.

     (County of Dumbarton.)

     By the Rev. Mr JOHN GILLESPIE, Minister of that Parish.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   ARROQUHAR is a Celtic word, which dignifies a high
or hilly country.  It is generally pronounced, in the
Gaelic language, Arrar, which is a contraction of Ardthir,
and signifying high, and thir a country.  The name is very
descriptive of the place, which is high and mountainous,
having very little flat or arable ground in it.  The extent of
the parish is near 14 miles long, exclusive of 4 farms, which
lie on the east side of Lochlomond, near the north end of it.
The mean breadth may be computed at 3 miles.  It is situ-
ated in the county and presbytery of Dumbarton, and in the
synod of Glasgow and Ayr.

     Soil, Climate, and Diseases.-The surface of some of the
farms is smooth, and clothed with a beautiful verdure, inter-
mixed with heath and bent; of others rocky, but the inter-
mediate spaces afford excellent pasture for sheep.  When the
pasturing of the black cattle prevailed here, the surface was most-
ly covered with heath, and had a dismal appearance; but
since the introduction of sheep, the country has assumed a 
different aspect.  The climate is very temperate in this place,
