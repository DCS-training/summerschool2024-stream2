city, nor whether they can appoint successors,-this plan does not
obviate, but only postpones, the difficulty respecting the ultimate
disposal of the fund.
   The late Charles Marjoribanks, Esq. M. P. for Berwickshire, be-
queathed first L. 10 and afterwards L. 100 to the poor of Dunse, to
be at the disposal of the minister. By far the greater part of this
is already distributed, and the rest is in the course of distribu-
tion.
   Two Friendly Societies were instituted in 1780, and one in 1790.
They still exist, though not founded on the most approved princi-
ples of calculation. The Beriwickshire Farmers' Widows' Fund,
from that cause, has almost sunk under its own weight.
   Fairs.-There are three fairs annually held in Dunse,-one in
June, another in August, and another in November, for cattle and
horses; and four quarterly markets for sheep, held in March, May,
July, and September.
               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The most remarkable variation between the present state of the
parish and neighbourhood, and that which existed at the time of
the last Statistical Account, is in the rent of land. Land which
then let at 15s. and 7s. per acre, now lets at L. 2, 10s. and L. 1, 5s.
per acre. Every improvement in the system of husbandry is speedily
adopted.
