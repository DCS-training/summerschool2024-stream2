lished by the family when they reared a summer house, and
in an upper apartment was found a great quantity of human
bones.-There are in the parish the 4 communion cups used
by John Knox when he first dispensed the sacrement in Scot-
land.  The cups were originaly used for the purpose of
candlesticks, and perhaps from the necessity of the time con-
verted to this pious purpose.  Their hollow bottom rever-
sed forms the cup, and the middle, where the socket seems to
be screwed out, forms the foot.  They are of the finest sil-
ver, and in modern times make a very ancient appearance.
They are kept with great care by the family of Glencairn at
Finlayston, and the parish is favoured with the use of them
on occasion of dispensing the sacrament.  The people respect
them much for their antiquity, as well as for the solemnity
attending them in former and latter times.
