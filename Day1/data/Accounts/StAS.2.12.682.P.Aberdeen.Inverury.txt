The Earl of Kintore holds nearly one-half of the burgh lands.
The other burgb heritors are fully 100 in number.  Of the land-
ward heritors, Mr Gordon of Manar alone is resident.  His mansion
lies three miles west of Inverury; it is situated on the southern
face of the hill of Manar, and has the Don in view at a distance
of 500 or 600 yards, is well wooded, and completely sheltered on
the north and west.  The house is modern, and is at once sub-
stantial, comfortable, and commodious,  On the lands of Manar,
the now ruinous chapel of St Apolonarius, the patron saint of
the parish, stood.  The farm is hence, by a corruption, called
Polander.  One of the two annual fairs, formerly held in the parish,
was called Polander Fair; the other, on the Bth of September,
was called Latter Lady Day, from being held on the anniversary
of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin.  To Mr Gordon now also
belong the lands of Blackhall and Conglass.  In reference to the
former, it is said, in the View of the Diocese of Aberdeen, already
quoted, "Blackhall, formerly the seat of the Blackhalls of that
Ilk, but since purchased by Thane of Blackhall, and now, 1726,
sold to one Grant."
   Parochial Records.-The session records of the parish date
from 1716, and make up three volumes.  They have been kept
with sufficient regularity.  For many years after the Reformation,
Inverury appears to have been left without any pastor.  The first
provision made for its spiritual wants was in November 1570,
when Andro' Spens was appointed Reader at Monkegye, with a
yearly stipend of L.20.  The reader was the lowest of the three
orders of ecclesiastics, in the early stages of the Scotch church.
His office was simply to read the Scriptures to the people; the
expounder was allowed to lecture or explain what he read; while,
to the clergyman alone, was entrusted tho administration of the
Sacraments.  James Mill, Minister of Inverury, was one of those
