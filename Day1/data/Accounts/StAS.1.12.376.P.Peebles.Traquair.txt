relief, is 23 L., arising from mortified money, a voluntary as-
sessment of themselves by the heritors of 61., and the collec-

and 1oo L.  Scots by Mr. Thomas Moffat merchant in Peebles,

only one public house, which is seldom, if at all frequented,
but by those who are transacting business, or by travellers,
and is on these accounts necessary.  They are now sober, and

the exertion of these qualities, as was evidenced both in the
dearth of 1782, and since, to a poor widow, who was left
with 6 children.  They enjoy, in a considerable degree, the
comforts and advantages of civilized life.  Even the poorest
