due, and tribute to whom tribute is due.  From their fa-
thers, they learned these principles, and their children are
instructed in the same.-If the price of many of the ne-
cessaries of life is greatly encreased, the price of labour is
more than doubled since the year 1774.  Then, the wages
of a man servant were about 4 L. Sterling; now they are
9 L. 10 L., with victuals and lodging.  The wages of fe-
male servants and day-labourers have risen in the same
proportion.  The people of this country, in general, are
happy, and will remain so, if they suffer not themselves
to fall under the influence of ambitious, disappointed, tur-
bulent, and ill-designing demagogoues.  The industrious
have ample encouragement, plenty of work, good pay-
ment, and full security for their persons, character, and
property.  Very few young men go from this parish either
to the army or navy:  a sure proof of their not being ad-
dicted to indleness or vice.  As to great crimes, they are
not known here.  No person recollects an instance of sui-
cide or murder; nor of any one who had been tried ca-
pitally.  And such is their peaceable disposition and in-
tegrity, that not many have been involved in law-suits.

   Climate.-The air of the parish is keen, but not un-
healty.  There are 2 men now alive between 80 and 90
years of age, and still strong and active; and 16 persons
between 70 and 80.-The diseases prevalent here are such
as are common in the country.  Not a few suffer from
rheumatisms and scrofulous disorders:  agues are scarcely
known:  the small pox have frequently made severe ra-
vages among the children.  By that fatal disorder, in 1775,
no fewer than 20 were carried off in the space of 6 weeks.
At that time, the prejudice of the people against inocula-
tion was inveterate*.
