earth appeared.  The foundation of the castle wall is seve-
ral feet below the surface of the water, and in all likeli-
hood rests on piles of oak.
   On the western shore of the loch of Clunie stands the
old castle-hill, a large green mound, partly natural and
partly artificial, on the top of which are the ruins of a ve-
ry old building.  Some aged persons still alive remember
to have seen a small aperture, now invisible, at the edge
of one of the fragments of the ruins, where, if a stone
was thrown in, it was heard for some time, as if rolling
down a stair-case.  From this it seems probable, that were
a section of the hill to be made, some curious discoveries
might be the consequence.  The castle-hill is of an ellipti-
cal form, extending in length from N. to S. about 190
yards at its base, and rising about 50 feet above the level
of the loch.  A green terrace surrounds the hill; and on
the N. side one terrace rises above another.  The area of
the summit approaches to an elliptical plain, a little incli-
ned towards the east; of this plain, the longitudinal diame-
ter, from N. to S. is about 90 yards, and the transverse a-
bout 40.  The old castle has stood on the south end of the
summit, commanding a distinct view of the neighbour-
hood, so as not to have been easily taken by sur-
prise.  Some vestiges of it still remain; but neither its
form nor dimensions can be traced with any degree of pre-
cision.  The principal fortifications seem to have run a-
long the land side, and the loch and the declivity of the hill
appear to have defended it on the east, where it is proba-
ble there has been an easy communication with the island
by means of boats; so that, in case of the castle being ta-
ken, the island might afford a refuge to the besieged.
Concerning this piece of antiquity no written record can
be found.  According to the tradition of the neighbour-
hood, it was a summer palace or hunting-seat of Kenneth
