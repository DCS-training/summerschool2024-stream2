adopting a very spirited mode of improvement, has convert-
ed a piece of ground, which, till he gained possession of it,
lay almost wild and uncultivated, into rich pasture, for which
he receives annually L. 2, 5 s. per acre, without the liberty of
tillage; and his success may encourage others, who have it
in their power, to follow his example.  Upon the whole, it
must be allowed, that the value of this parish has increased
in a very rapid progress.  Its valuation in Scotch money is
L. 3167.  In 1771, when the late minister applied for an
augmentation of stipend, the stock and teind were found to
amount to no more than L. 1850 Sterling, and now
the rental is above L. 3400, exclusive of minister's sti-
pend, cess, and school salary.  This rise in its value, must
be accounted for, by the increased price, of all the different
articles, produced by the ground, (of which Cathart, from
its vicinity to Glasgow, is in a situation fully to avail it-
self), as well as from a more improved mode of agriculture.

   Business.-This parish may be considered almost entirely
as an agricultural district.  While the manufactures, of
Paisley and Glasgow, have diffused themselves through all
the neighbouring parishes, to a much greater distance, they
have as yet made but inconsiderable progress in Cathcart.
How long this may be the cafe, it is difficult to determine.
Indeed, manufacturers have little encouragement to settle
here, from the hopes of finding a cheaper market; as every
article of provision sells as high as in Glasgow, with the
additional expence, of sending to that town, for those neces-
saries which the parish cannot afford.  There is neither
butcher, brewer, nor baker, within its bounds:  At the
same time the parish abounds with many other articles, es-
sentially necessary to the manufacturer, and without which
indeed, he cannot go to work; such as coal, lime and wa-
ter.  Upon the Cart, there are many favourable situations
