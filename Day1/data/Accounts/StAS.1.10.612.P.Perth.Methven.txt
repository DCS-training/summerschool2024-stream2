of Forth, or from Sunderland.  Some years ago, there was
also a good deal of marl discovered, with which some of the
grounds have been manured.  Tenants now see the error
of over cropping their lands, after lime or marl, and there-
fore often sow clover and rye-grafts with their barley crop.
Every possessor of a few roods of ground, finds it profitable
to sow some pounds of red clover*.  Barley, grass, oats,
slax, pease, and beans, are the common crops+.  Of late,
some wheat has been raised, but very few turnips.  Probably,
however, the farmers, in a few more years, will see it their
interest to clean their grounds with a turnip fallow, where
land is suitable for producing that valuable root ; for it seems
to be allowed, that the two great points of husbandry are,
to keep ground clear of root-weeds, (which cannot be done
so profitably as by a turnip fallow well dressed;) and to keep
it always in good heart, (which is to be done by the plenty
of dong, arising from the use of turnips).  The  average
rent, per acre, of the cultivated ground, is probably  about
10 s.  There are a few acres, in the near neighbourhood of
the village, let at 2 L. 2 s. and upwards ; and two pretty

*When grass first began to be introduced as a crop, the
old tenants were much offended ; and their common language
was, 'That is was a Shame to see beast's meat growing where
men's meat should grow.'

+At an average of 7 years, preceeding 1792, oat meal and
barley gave 14 s. 6 d. per doll, Linlithgow measure.  A good
ploughman has 8 L. and his maintenance ; a servant maid from
50 s. to 3 L.; a day-labourer 1 s. ; and, in public works, from
1 s. to 1 s. 6 d. per day.

+This parish owes much of its improvements to MR GRAHAM
of BALGOWAN, who first set the example of inclosing his farms,
and gave encouragement to judiciuos tenants, by granting them
easy leases, and providing them with comfortable houses.
