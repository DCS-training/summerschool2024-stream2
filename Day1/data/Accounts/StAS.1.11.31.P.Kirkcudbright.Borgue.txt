     NUMBER II.

     PARISH OF BORGUE.

     (Stewartry and Presbytery of Kirkcudbright-Synod of
     Galloway.)

     By the Rev. Mr. SAMUEL SMITH, Minister.

     Erection and Names.

   BORGUE, SENWICK and KIRKANDREWS, were united
about the year 1870.  Borgue, or Borg, the general
name of the united parishes, is derived from the Gaelic word
burg, which signifies a little bill, and is certainly very de-
scriptive, either of the situation of the church, which is placed
on a beautiful eminence, in the middle of the parish, or of the
general appearance of this district of land, which is remark-
ably unequal in its surface.  Senwick (originally Sandwick),
is compounded of sand and wick, two Gaelic words, signify-
ing a narrow neck of land.  This is also very descriptive,
both of the situation and soil.  Kirkandrews evidently takes
its name from the tutelary saint of Scotland, to whom it was
dedicated.
