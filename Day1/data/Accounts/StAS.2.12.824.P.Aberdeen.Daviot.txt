female servants above twenty, 36; female servants under twenty,
28; male servants above twenty employed in handicraft, 5; do.
under twenty, employed in handicraft, 2; total, 180 = 324; and
the married women, and such of the inhabitants' children as
are not in service, and continue to reside in the parish, make up
the remainder of the population.  The whole population of the
parish may be thus classified; 144 occupants of houses; 99 mar-
ried women, 362 children, and 180 servants.
   Agriculture.-The land in the parish under tillage measures
about 3700 acres; the waste land, 150, of which 120 will, at no
distant period, be improved; in wood, 180; and in moss, 100; in
whole about 4130 Scotch, or nearly 5250 imperial acres. The
plantations within the parish are chiefly of Scotch fir and larch.
These continue to grow for about forty or fifty years, seldom at-
taining any great size, and then begin to decay.  No good
mode of thinning has been sufficiently attended to; and con-
sequently the value of the whole is comparatively small.  The
soil seems much better adapted for the growth of hard-wood,
chiefly beech, elm, and ash ; and of these there are some very
good specimens in the parish, and especially around the mansion-
house of Glack.  The mode of filling up blanks where, they have
occurred in these plantations, when they are somewhat advanced,
seems to have been utterly unprofitable.  Young plants stuck in
among trees of twenty or thirty years growth have either died out,
or rapidly shot up to a great height, without attaining any useful
