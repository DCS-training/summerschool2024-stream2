           liva, and, therefore, he recommended to her parents to confine
	   her totally to the spinning of wool. She was visited again, in the
	   year 1775, and found to be greatly improved in her looks, as well
	   as in strength. Her food was also increased considerably in quan-
	   tity, though even then she did not take more than would be suf-
	   ficient to sustain an infant of two years of age.
	      This extraordinary woman continued to live to an advanced pe-
	   riod of life, taking no nourishment except a little of the thinnest
	   gruel, which she received through the aperture which had been
	   made by breaking two of her fore-teeth for the purpose of feeding
	   her. She died in the year 1796, in the seventieth year of her
	   age.
	      There is a particular description of her case in the Journal of
	   Philosophical Transactions, Vol. lxvii., Gentleman's Magazine
	   for 1778, p. 22, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Pennant's Tour in
	   Scotland; from which, as well as from authentic private sources of
	   information, the above account is taken.
