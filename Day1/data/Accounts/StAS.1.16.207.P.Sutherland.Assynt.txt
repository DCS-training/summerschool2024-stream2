thereby pretending to foretel either a favourable season,
or the reverse.  Mrs Mackenzie of Ardloch made a present
of this Druidical hook to his Lordship.
   Adjacent to the present parochial kirk is to be seen the
only remaining part of the first of that kind that was built
here.  The case was, one ’neas, or Angus Macleod, laird
of Affint, having gone to Rome to visit the Pope; and the
Pontiff conferring favours, the laird in return vowed, that
when he returned to Affint, he would build and endow a
kirk, which the laird performed, to the amount of the fifth
part of his then yearly rent.  The only vestige of this an-
cient building is a vault, a burial place; it is high arched.
The present Mr Macleod of Geanies, Sheriff-depute of the
county of Ross, as immediate descendent of these lairds,
gave it a repair a few years ago, but not to the better, as
one William Cowie, from Tain, employed, pulled down
an upper apartment which was over the arch, which the
natives reported to be a place for private devotion.  Heath
now grows on the top of the arch.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The Highland girls of this
parish for the most part marry at the age of betwixt 16
and 21 years; the lads at that of betwixt 20 and 25.  There
are some instances of women bearing children to the age of
50 years at least.  It is no uncommon sight to see a grand-
mother give her breast to her own grandchild to suckle.
Some fond mothers nurse their children for two years.
Other mothers nurse their infants for three; and truly the
narrator has seen a boy at his mother's breast at the age of
four years, and then break hasle-nuts under his teeth.
   As for dunes, there are some to be seen here: 1 ft, That
very large one at Clachtoll, close by the sea, towards the
farm of Store.  It exceeds by far any of the kind the nar-
rator ever saw.  Three circular out-works at regular di-
stances, surround it on the land-side; the boisterous ocean
