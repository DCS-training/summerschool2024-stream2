an half, and upwards, the greatest part of which lies on
the S. Side; and as the plain continues several miles be-
low Govan, has a good deal of plantations upon it, as well
as a considerable number of elegant villas, and is all
along intersected by the Clyde, upon which vessels are
constantly passing either to or from Glasgow, it forms
from the high grounds on the S. And N., one of the most
delightful landscapes that can be imagined.

   State of Ferry.-This division of the parish, however,
though a remarkable addition to the beauty of its scene-
ry, is felt as a great inconvenience by the parishioners
on the N. side of the Clyde.  There is no bridge over
this river below Glasgow; and its banks are frequently
so overflown by heavy falls of rain, that all communica-

is either entirely stopped, or rendered extremely trouble-
some and dangerous.  At any time, indeed, passing from
the one side to the other, is inconvenient to old and in-
firm people, and to those who find it necessary to cross
the water at funerals; because, though there was once
a quay on the N. side, it has been completely sanded up,
since the commencement of the operations mentioned
in the account of Glasgow, for improving the navigation
of the river; and the ferry, which is become private pro-
perty, has been long in a very neglected state.  As some
gentlemen in the parish, however, who are no less dis-
tinguished by their public spirit, than by the extent of
their possessions, have, of late, been turning their atten-
tion to the improvement of the ferry, and are endea-
vouring to procure a boat of the same kind as at Ren-
frew, the inconvenience complained of, it is hoped, will
be soon, in a great measure, if not entirely, removed:
