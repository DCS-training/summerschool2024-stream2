   An intelligent farmer in the parish, (David Irvine of Pol-
moody,) has tried a very important and successful experiment
for improving his wool.  In the years 1787, 1788, and 1789, he
put Eskdale and Tiviotdale rams, of the white faced, polled
kind, the fame with the Cheviot breed, to his ewes, of the horned,
black-faced kind. In the year 1790, he fold the wool of the
sheep, produced by the cross, at 10 s. the 6 fleeces; the
wool of his other stock, which were of the horned, black-faced
kind, and went exactly on the same pasture, only at 6s 3d. the
7 fleeces.  He has found the sheep produced from the white-
faced polled rams, as healthy as his other sheep; and that an
equal number may be fed on the same pasture.  The weight of
the carcase has not been materially altered.
   The ideas of the other farmers do not, as yet, coincide with
this; and many of them are eminently skillfull in the manage-
ment of sheep.  Yet Mr Irvine's farm, is as high ground, as al-
most any in Scotland.  Should his plan of improvement be
justified by farther experiments, it would double the value
of the wool produced in the parish, by increasing the weight
a seventh part, and the price more than a third.
   Few of the farmers wash their sheep.  They smear heavily;
and apprehend, that the wool would lose more in weight, by o-
mitting that operation, than the additional price, (were it un-
smeared.) would compensate.
   It is not long since the sheep, in this part of the country, were
of the four horned kind; a fewof which, it is said, remain
still in some parts of Nithsdale.  Their body is smaller, but their

*There can be no doubt, that the fine, close, short woolled
breed of sheep, is the proper sort for a hilly country; and that
their wool may be brought even on the Moffat hills, to 30s. nay,
perhaps, to 40s, a stone.
