pear, that great improvements have been made here in the
art of gardening.  In the few fields within the limits of
the parish are sown oats, bear, or big, rarely wheat, rye,
pease, or beans; which, from the general disuse at present, it
may be concluded that their culture here has not answered
expectation.  Flax is sometimes tried with success; clover
and rye-grass are frequently sown; and some small spots of
ground have been laid down with saintfoin and lucerne, by
way of experiment.
   In the parish of Old Machar are two limestone-quar-
ries, one at Silverburn, and another about a mile north
from it on the Old Meldrum road.  Neither of them have
been wrought to any great extent.  Nine men will, in ten
days, quarry and break stones to fill and fire the kiln at Sil-
verburn.  Each kiln will require 13 bolls English coals,
or 18 bolls Scotch coals under duty.  The average pro-
duce of a kiln is between 150 and 180 bolls of slacked
lime, water measure.  Each boll of shells will yield, one
and a half boll of powdered lime.  Such stones as are not
burnt are thrown into the next kiln.  The quarry at the
other kiln is in all respects so similar to this, that the same
remarks may, with sufficient accuracy, be applied to both.
The limestone of these quarries is not rich; it does not
swell much in burning, and it has in it a considerable pro-
portion of sand; it answers well in building, but is not so
good for manure, especially in sandy soil like ours.  The
tacksman of these quarries desisted for some time from
working them on account of the rise on labourer's wages,
and the high price of coals.  Since the tax on coals was
taken off, he has again opened them; and when his lease
expires, which will be soon, they will probably be wrought
to a greater extent than formerly.
   Granite abounds in the parish.  There are excellent quar-
ries of it at Rubislaw, Loanhead, Pitmuxton, and other
