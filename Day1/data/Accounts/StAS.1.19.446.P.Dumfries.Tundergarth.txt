principal seat of the Johnstones.  The language of this pa-
rish has always been a purely Saxon dialect of the old Low-

signifying the Castle of the Garden, or rather, perhaps, the
Castle of the Sanctuary.

   Brunswark.-At its western border, this parish almost
touches the base of the famous hill of Brunswark.  That
hill owes its celebrity to the remains of two Roman encamp-
ments, which appear on the eastern and on the western side
of its declivity.  The remains of these encampments are
still exceedingly distinct.  It seems highly probable that
they were at first formed by the Romans besieging a body of
the ancient Britons, who had occupied the summit of the hill.
It was so remarkable a station, that it could not fail to be con-
tinually occupied in all subsequent wars among the inhabi-
tants of these regions, whether contending among themselves,
or opposing stranger-invaders.  The Anglo-Saxons, the
Scotch, and English, in all their border-wars, naturally post-
ed themselves often on the summit of Brunswark, as a place,
by its elevation above the surrounding country, admirably
fitted at once for an impregnable post, and for a station of
prospect, from which all the movements of surrounding
enemies might be spied.
