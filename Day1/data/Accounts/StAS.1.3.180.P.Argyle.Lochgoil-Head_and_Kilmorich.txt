pears to be an inflammation of the bowels; it carries them
off in a few hours; but if the carcase is found within a day
after the animal dies, and entire, it sells for half price.  This
diseased meat is partly eat by servants, partly by cottages, and
a considerable quantity of it is saltedd and sent to market.  No
antidote has yet been discovered against this disease.  It usual-
ly begins in the end of harvest, and it chiefly attacks that
year's lambs, and always the fattest of them.  It is believed,
that the tacksmen of this country lose a fourth of their
young sheep by this disorder; it is not so destructive in the
low parts of Scotland; the lambs there, it is said, are pas-
tured separately from the rest of the stock, and kept poor in
flesh; but the high steep hills, and thick fogs in this coun-
try, render it impossible to pasture sheep in separate hirsles,
as they do in the south.  It does not appear that the sheep
which have been introduced within these last 40 years, are
of a better kind, than the few sheep which were in the
country before that period.  It must be confessed, that the
present kind are larger, but there was no attention paid to
the improvement of the old breed.  The breed of rams was 
never chnged, they had access to the ewes at all times of 
the year; the ewes often brought forth in the months of Fe-
bruary and March, and a great number of the lambs perished
in the storm; the few who survived wanting suitable nourish-
ment, were stinted in their growth, and the refuse of the
lambs were never sold off.  Notwithstanding these disadvan-
tages, the old sheep were not much inferior in bulk to the
present kind, and their flesh was equally fat, delicious, and
well-flavoured.

   Wool.-Whatever be the case, with regard to the carcase,
the wool of the present breed of sheep is much inferior to
that which grew upon the old Highland kind.  The present
