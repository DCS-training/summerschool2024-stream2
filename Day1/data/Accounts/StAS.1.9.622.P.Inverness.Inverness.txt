   Poor.-The number of poor at present on the roll a-
mounts to 222, of which there are 68 stated pensioners,
who are supplied, some of them weekly, and others quar-
terly.  The pensions are from 25 s. each to L. 4 Sterling
a-year; but the supplies occasionally given to a distressed
family, frequently exceed the highest yearly allowance to
a stated pensioner.  The principal stock in the manage-
ment of the kirk-session for the relief of the poor, in lands
and bonds, is L. 2520:18:10.  This stock is made up of
legacies, chiefly in the last century.  Another fund is the
weekly collections; they amount, one year with another,
to L. 70 Sterling.  Besides these, there are two other funds
in the trust of the kirk-session: The one a legacy of
L. 166:13:4 Sterling, by the laird of Macintosh, the in-
terest of which is applied to the education of two boys at
the schools of Inverness; and the other by Mr George
Duncan, late merchant here, in land, yielding L. 200 Scots
