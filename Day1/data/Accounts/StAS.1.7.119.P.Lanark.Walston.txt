   Productions, Etc.  There are few trees in the parish,
though ash, plain tree, and various kinds of fir, would thrive
very well.  The parish lies high, and is exposed to severe
blasts of wind; one of the first improvements, therefore,
which the proprietors ought to let about, is to inclose their
grounds with stripe and clumps of planting.  A little in this
way has been done in the neighbourhood, and with great
success.  What has been done in this parish has been done
with no judgment; and no pains have been bestowed upon
the plants in their infancy.  The great secrets of planting
are, to fence welt, to plant thick at first, and to weed or thin
them judiciously, as the plants grow up.  To plant a hill,
one should plant the base of it first, and advance upon the
hill, as the timber on the lower parts becomes a proper shel-
ter for the higher.
   In the parish there are about 320 black cattle; 96o sheep,
of the black faced kind; and 90 horses.  It contains about
3000 Scotch acres of land; about 2000 are arable, and of
these 450 are employed annually in raising oats, 50 in barley,
15 in potatoes, and 10 in flax.  The other 1475 acres of
arable, together with about 1000 of heath and marshy
ground, are employed in pasture.  The average rent of the
best arable land is about 25 s.; and of the inferior, about
half a crown per acre.  The valued rent of the parish is
1233 L. Scots; and the real rent at present about 700 L. Sterl.
The Scotch plough is almost the only one in use.  The far-
mers are only beginning to sow turnip and artificial grasses.
The parish annually exports articles of provision, such as but-
ter, cheese, fowls, meal, bear, black cattle, and sheep.
