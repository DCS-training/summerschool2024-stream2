tion, prosecuted by the present minister, the stipend may,
on an average, be reckoned L. 150 annually.  The mini-
ster has also the manse and glebe of Kilmadock, which con-
tains six acres of rich land, equal in quality to any within
the parish, as church-lands generally are.  The manse was
lately repaired, and a very excellent set of a new office-houses
built by the heritors.
   Kilmadock manse is a situation exactly suitable to religi-
ous retirement, and is more centrical to the parish in gene-
ral than Doune, which stands rather to the east side.  If the
population increase, a chapel of ease, or a new erection will,
be necessary, when the church of Kilmadock may be re-
built, and the inhabitants thus well accommodated.

   Schools, etc.-The parish school is held at Doune, and is
generally well attended.  Mr William Young, the present
schoolmaster, is a very industrious teacher, and has kept the
school with great success for a long period back.
   There are at present 70 scholars, 45 at English, 20 at
arithmetic and bookkeeping, and only 5 at the Latin lan-
guage.  The school wages are extremely moderate, 1 s. 3 d.
for English, and 2 s. 6 d. for arithmetic, bookkeeping, and
Latin, per quarter.  The schoolmaster has besides a free
house and garden, and his perquisites as session-clerk and
precenter.  His fixed salary was formerly only L. 100
Scots, but the heritors very properly augmented it to L. 200
Scots.  The fees of proclamations, on 3 Sundays, are, 1 s.
8 d. to the poor, 2 s. to the clerk, and 6d. to the officer;
on 2 Sundays, 2s. to the clerk, 3 s. 6 d. to the poor, and 6 d.
to the officer; and on 1 Sunday, 6 s. to the clerk, 10 s. 6 d.
to the poor, and 1 s. 6 d. to the officer.  There appears a
mistake in giving the clerk only 2 s. for 2 Sundays, when 
he gets the same for 3.  There are about 60 baptisms, and
24 marriages annually.  The fees of baptisms are, 10 d. to
