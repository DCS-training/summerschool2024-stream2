paupers, in 1829.  The encouragement given to it by the public
was such, that next year the managers were enabled to increase
the number to thirty, and in 1835 ten more were received.  The
ages within which these girls are admitted, are from six to nine;
the branches of education taught are, reading, writing, arithmetic,
church music, sewing, knitting, and house-work, with instructions
in the principles of religion, and they continue inmates of the hos-
pital generally till they reach the age of fourteen.
   The income of the hospital is derived from an annual collection
in the churches, the interest of the subscribed capital, and a fourth
part of the proceeds of Mr Simpson of Colliehill's mortification to
the workhouse of Aberdeen; and the following table exhibits its
amount, with that of the expenditure, for the last seven years:

   House of Refuge.-The establishment of a House of Refuge in
Aberdeen had been several times agitated, but it was not until
1836 that sufficient funds for the purpose could be obtained.  The
munificent donation of L.1000, then given by George Watt, Esq.
surgeon, for the purpose of commencing this useful charity, was
speedily followed up by a general subscription in the town and
neighbourhood, and the sum of L. 3000 was raised in the course of
a few months,-annual contributions to the extent of L. 136 being
at the same time subscribed for, and the institution was commen-
ced, a body of directors chosen, and regulations laid down at a
public, meeting, of the inhabitants.
   A suitable house having been hired and furnished, the House of
Refuge was opened on the 5th September 1836.  The mode of com-
ducting the details of its management has been principally borrow-
ed from the House of Refuge in Edinburgh ; and though many
and great difficulties occurred in the outset, as indeed was to be
anticipated, there is abundant reason to know that not a little
good has been done by the institution, (especially in regard to great
numbers of neglected children, who are furnished with that educa-

and that at an extremely moderate expense.
