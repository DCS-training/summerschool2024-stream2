     of Kirklistoun.

In the year 1782, the industrious poor were provided for
by a voluntary subscription; and the money was distributed
by a committee of subscribers.  The sum raised in this man-
ner was upwards of 80 L.  This circumstance prevented any
alteration in the funds or the list for that year.  The private
charities (if what is given regularly for a continuance of years
deserves no better name) are so considerable and extensive
as to render the above statement inadequate to the actual
number of poor in the parish.
