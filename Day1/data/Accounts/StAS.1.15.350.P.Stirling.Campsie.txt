they observe their neighhours thriving in any profession, they immediately
run into it, without considering whether they have industry or talents to suc-
ceed; such has, of late, been too much the case in the grazing line; so that
now, the utmost industry and talents can scarcely enable them to live.  The
country banks afforded abundance of credit to every adventurer; from such
a competition amongst these would-be-graziers, the grass-farms are too
high rented; the cattle are dear bought from their rearers; and the result
has been, that notwithstanding the cry of the goodness of the times, very lit-
tle profit has been made by the people embarked in this profession; for these
ten years past, many bankrupcies have taken place among that class of men;
It indulges the adventurous spirit of the people, and therefore will always be
a favourite profession, let the profits be what they will.  2dly.  The rage for
Highland cattle is too great, more so than these cattle deserve; it is true,
where ground is high and much exposed, such cattle is more adapted for the
pasture, than the cattle which the low country produces; but perhaps it
would be the interest of the grazier, to turn all our brae ground in sheep pas-
ture, and the grounds of the valley into grass farms, for lowland cattle,
where, if once winter food were produced, and the land either protected by
planting, or shades built where they might be fed with turnip in the open
air; the prospects of greater profits upon the fattening of beasts would be
procured, than by the imperfect mode of buying either winterers at the Down
markets, or lean cattle at Belting, and selling them at Martinmas.  3dly,
There is another defect which attends the present system of grazing in this
country, and which tends to render the beef of Highland cattle too dear to
the consumer; there being no less than three different classes of people who
must have their profits within the year: There is the drover, who collects
these cattle in small parcels from the rearer, and sells them at fairs, at an ad-
vanced price to the graziers; the grazier, again, very often sells his cattle to
the couper, who runs them at fairs to the consumer, and sometimes exacts a
profit almost equal to that of the grazier: In short, there is too much of the
spirit of adventure in this profession, whereby both the grazier and consum-
er are losers.
