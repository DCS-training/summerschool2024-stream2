hame, Esq. of Auchenharvie, are alternately patrons of the parish.
   It adds not a little to the general comfort, that there is in the
parish such abundance of excellent coal; for though coal is high-
priced at present, it is still cheap to us, compared with what it is to
those at a distance. The colliers have high wages, and might all be
comfortable; and many of them are so. The colliers are an interest-
ing class, and would stand higher in public opinion were it not for

<FOOTNOTE>Almost all in this mournful list of absenters profess to belong to the Established
Church; yea, in their own way, to be staunch friends of the Church; and some of
them say, when their minister expostulates with them, "I am sure if we do not come
to you, we do not go to any body else." It must be owned that they have not had
fair play. It is little more than three years since they have had a church that could
contain even the half of those who were of age to attend. Matters are on a better
footing now; and we hope that, under their present advantages, many of them may be
induced to give more pleasing proof of their regard for the church and their minister.
