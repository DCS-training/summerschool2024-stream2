   People.-The people are sober, quiet, active, and industri-
ous, and generally wealthy.  There are few poor, and none
that go a-begging.  The poor's funds are good, and more
than sufficient for the parish poor.  The present minister,
Mr Malcolm Brown, was settled here in the 1734, and is
now a man above 90 years of age, with judgment and me-
mory sound and good, but sight and hearing greatly on the
decline.  He can walk straight and steady, ride a mile once or
twice a week, marry and baptize all that offer, and preaches
once or twice a year.  The stipend is 8 chalders.  He has
been married these 50 years; and his wife, near 80, is still a
strong, active, lively, and sensible woman.  They are both
much esteemed and respected by all that know them.
