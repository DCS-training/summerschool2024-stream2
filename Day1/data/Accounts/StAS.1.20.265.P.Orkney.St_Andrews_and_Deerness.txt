of them difficult to be ascertained.  Most families in the pa-
rish rear swine, which are generally of a black or reddish co-
lour, and of a very diminutive size.  They do great mis-
chief to the fields with their faouts.  Their number is not
below 500.

   Population.-The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, from
St Andrews and Deerness, was 1650 souls.  At present,
there are in St Andrews 133 families, consisting of 675 per-
sons; and in Deerness, (including Copinshay, an island of a
mile long, inhabited by two families), there are 131 fami-
lies, and 660 souls.  The baptisms in St Andrews alone,
for one year, are 30. Marriages 5.  There are no registers
of the burials kept in either parish; but, one year with ano-
ther, there were about 8 burials yearly in St Andrews since
the present incumbent was settled.
   The population of both parishes, amounting to 1335, is
considerably below the return made to Dr Webster, and
also much below an enumeration made by Mr Scollay the
last incumbent, in 1772, when the inhabitants of both pa-
rishes were 1515.  The only cause that can be assigned for
so great a decrease, is the continual drain of men to the na-
vy, to the northern fisheries, and, above all, to Hudson's
Bay.  Before the year 1741, the Hudson Bay Company's
servants were all taken from England, Ireland, or the Shet-
land isles.  About 1741, or 1743, they began to get a few
from Orkney, and finding them to be submissive and indu-
strious, they now take most, or all, of their tradesfolk and
contracted servants from this country.  These, by the best
accounts that can be collected from the most intelligent of
the people who have been there, amount to about 1000 in
all.  Some of them are cut off by accidents every year;
some of them are rendered useless by sickness; and many
of them, when their indentures are up, return home.  To
