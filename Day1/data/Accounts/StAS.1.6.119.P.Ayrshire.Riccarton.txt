     of Riccartoun.

   Ecclesiastical State, Poor, and School.-There are very few
Seceders, and no Roman Catholics in the parish.  Before the
year 1648, there was only one minister for the parishes of Ric-
cartoun and Craigie.  A disjunction of the parishes was then
made, and a minister settled in each.  The church of Riccar-
toun was almost wholly rebuilt in the year 1772, and is in to-
lerably good repair.  The manse was lately rebuilt.  The pa-
tron of the parish is Sir William Cuningham of Caprington,
Bart.  The stipend is 5 chalders of victual, meal and bear,
L. 340 Scotch in money, with a glebe containing 8 acres of a-
rable land.
   The poor in this parish are, at present, but slenderly sup-
ported.  Almost the only fund for maintaining them arises
from the voluntary contributions of the people at church.  A
considerable sum of money which belonged to them was, some
years ago, lost by the failure of a mercantile company.  The
number of poor is fortunately not great.  There are only at
present upon the roll 15 persons, none of whom are permitted
to beg.  About L. 24 may be yearly collected.
   The school here is very well attended.  The people are, in
general, desirous to give their children all the education which
their circumstances will permit.  The encouragement how-
ever, is not great, the salary being only 100 merks.  The wa-
ges are for teaching English 1 s. 6 d. for writing, 2 s. and for
arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. per quarter.

   Crops.-The principal crops raised in the parish are oats and
bear: the farmers find from experience that the soil is much
more favourable for producing oats.  Till within these few
years little or no wheat was sown in the parish; a considerable
number of acres are now, however, sown yearly with wheat,
which, when the ground is well prepared, succeeds very well.
The useful pratice of summer-fallowing is much more com-
