  Soils.-Extent of surface about 5600 acres:
Whereof 2000 acres are a deep black alluvial soil incumbent on sand or gravel, the
          substrata of part of which is whin-rock;
     1000 acres light sandy soil (thin) incumbent on sand or dry till;
     1400 acres black thin loam, on a cold retentive clay or till;
      200 acres cold thin clay, subsoil, barren clay mixed with weeping sand;
      100 acres moss, on a cold weeping sand and clay mixed;
      700 acres light black moorish soil, on a moorbiind sterile subsoil;
      200 acres uncultivated and under wood, the soil and subsoil of such a tex-
               ture as that of the preceding 700 acres.
  The various cattle-shows which are frequently held here and
in the adjoining districts, have contributed not a little to the im-
provement of farm stock. It is humbly suggested, that the great-
est advantages would follow if prizes, whether as medals or sums.of
money, were distributed, not only to such as rear the best horses,
bulls, and cows, &c. but to such as, in the judgment of competent
arbiters, had most distinguished themselves by draining, irrigating,
embanking, destroying weeds and vermin,--by the condition of their
enclosures,-by the nature of their management and crops,--by the
neatness and cleanliness with which they surrounded their dwel-
lings, and the order as well as comfort which prevailed within
them.
