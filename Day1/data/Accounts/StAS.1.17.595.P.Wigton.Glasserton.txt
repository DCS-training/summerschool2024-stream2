     emancipated from the servile state of villainage; the lands
passed into the hands of the ancestors and predecessors of their
present proprietors; and that system of life and rural oeco-
nomy, which we have surveyed, was at last introduced.

   Improvements Suggested.-It is to be wished and expected
from the liberal intelligence, and prudent activity of the land-
holders, and the inhabitants in general, of this parish, that
the culture of green crops may be more generally and heartily
adopted; that new efforts may be continually made among
them, to bring still more and more of their mosses and muirs
under tillage; that the farms may be still more carefully in-
closed and subdivided; that the culture of wheat, in a cer-
tain proportion, may be adopted into their agriculture,-
since where barley grows, wheat may, very often, be success-
fully produced; that the cross-roads may be multiplied and
improved; that, by the increase of navigation and trade at
the nearest sea-ports, and the introduction of new manufac-
tures into the county,-the great market for the produce of
the parish, may be, as it were, brought nearer to it; that
beef, mutton, and pork, may be prepared here in large quan-
tities, for sea-stores, and for other exportation; that, with-
out deserting their husbandry, these good people may take a
profitable share in the fishery of the coasts; and, above all,
that a parochial school, which is unaccountably wanting, may
be speedily instituted*.-H.
