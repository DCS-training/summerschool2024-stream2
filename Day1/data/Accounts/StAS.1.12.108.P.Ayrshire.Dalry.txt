years.  She was lastly married to another farmer, about the year 1772.  He
died in 1788, and she survived him about 9 months.  She was of a full habit of
body, and enjoyed good health, till about 5 months before her death, when she
began to fall off much, was confined to her bed, and her legs swelled.  Her
pregnant appearance still remained, and she told some of her neighbours, that
about 33 years ago, she expected to be delivered, and felt life and motion in
the child.  This excited the desire of the surgeons to have her body opened af-
ter her death.  Leave was granted by her friends, to a skilful surgeon in Berth
to open her.  But he not coming at the appointed time, two persons of small
skill and experience, performed the operation in a coarse manner, and could not
give a proper account of the situation in which they found the foetus.  They,
however, did find a child come to maturity, and in a perfect state of preserva-
tion.  It was immediately laid on the table, before more than a dozen of people
that were present.  The operators were allowed to carry it away; and I saw it
afterward myself.  The incrustation round it was tough, and of a horny ap-
pearance when I saw it, and in laying the incrustation open, it appeared one of
the child's arms had been harmed.  I heard it was afterward in the possession
of the late Dr. William Hamilton, and Mr. Monteath surgeon, Glasgow, for
some time, who took a drawing of it, as the persons who extracted it, would
not part with it, but at an extravagant price.  I have also heard, that some of
the medical gentlemen at Edinburgh, are in possession of it at this very time.
