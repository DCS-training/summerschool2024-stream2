     Statistical Account

   Schools.-There are 2 schools in the parish, the parochial,
and Society school.  The former is stationed at the manse,
near the church; the latter in Armdale; neither of them
well accommodated.  The first is quite ruinous, and the sa-
lary is only 100 merks, or 5 L. 11 s. 1 1/4 d. with 20 s. as pre-
centor and session clerk's dues, and one half of the baptism
money, (which was, last year, 15 s.) and 1 s. for each mar-
riage, of which there are about 16 at an average in a year.
The scholars are very few, 26 being the greatest number dur-
ing the course of last year.  In harvest there are not above 12
or 14, from which it is evident the schoolmaster's encourage-
ment is not great.  The quarterly dues are, for reading, 1 s.;
arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d.; and Latin, 2 s. 6 d.  A new shcool-
house is expected to be built soon.  The Society schoolmas-
ter has a salary of 10 L. with a dwelling house and school
house, (which is also to be rebuilt), a kail yard, with an acre
of ground, for raising corn, potatoes, grass, and provender
for one or two milk cows, gratis, from the proprietor, who
formerly received a guinea of rent for it.  He also has his
peats cut, dried, and brought home free.  In this school
there have been 33 scholars during the course of last year,
none of whom were taught gratis, except 5, who were really
indigent.

   Prices of Provisions and Labour.-Meal and bear fell at 12s.
per boll; 2 L. 10 s. or 3 L. is the price of a good cow; a wedder
costs 6 s. 7 s. or 8 s.; a sow, 10 s.; a pig, 1 s. or 1 s. 6 d.;
a goose, 1 s.; a hen, 4 d.; butter, 9 s. per stone, and cheese
4 s. 6 d.  A married servant, in husbandry, gets 6 bolls vic-
tual, and 40s. wages annually, which enables him to bring
up a family.  The usual wages of male and female servants
are as follow:  A man, 13 s. 4 d.; a lad, 10 s.; a boy, 3 s.
