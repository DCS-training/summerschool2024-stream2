parish was acquired from the late General Scott by Sir Wil-
liam Dunbar of Hempriggs.

   Poor.-The funds appropriated for the support of the
poor in the parish arise principally from the public collec-
tions in the church, which, deducting bad copper, do not
exceed from 10 L. to 12 L. per annum, consequently, at an
average, it is scarcely two shillings to each pensioner, there be-

those funds is owing to the absence of the gentry, who spend
their rents elsewhere, and leave the poor on their several

In such cases it were much to be wished, that either the
heritors by themselves or agents would assess themselves, as
is done in other parishes in Scotland, or that a law were ob-

relief of the poor.  The mulcts are applied towards payment
of the fees of the session clerk or parochial officers, etc.  If
a balance remains, it is distributed among the poor.

   Schools.-Besides the parochial school, there are no less
than five charity schools with established salaries in the pa-
rish, and also several private teachers.  Mr William Hallo-
wall, who, about forty years ago, was an itinerant minister in
this parish, and afterwards chaplain to the Charity Work-
house at Edinburgh where he died, bequeathed 21 L. for ever
to the parish of Wick, for endowing three charity schools, to
be built and upheld by the heritors on whose ground they
were erected.  Their salaries, on the application of the mini-
ster to the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge,
were somewhat augmented.  There are, besides, two other
schools which the Society were pleased to settle; one of them
is established in the town of Wick, for teaching through the
week, and a catechetical exercise on Sunday.  It is support-
