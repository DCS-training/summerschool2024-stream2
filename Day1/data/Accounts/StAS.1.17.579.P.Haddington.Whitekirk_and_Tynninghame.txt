     of Whitekirk and Tynninghame.

contained 3 villages, of which the least vestige is not now to
be seen.  In one of them were numbers of fishes, and
houses for the curing of herrings.  At present the number
of fishing boats in the parish is reduced to one.
   There are no manufactures or trades people, but such as
are necessary for carrying on the business of agriculture.
There are two ale-houses, and three others licensed to retail
British spirits.  There are 2 established schools in t he parish,
the one at Whitekirk, the other at Tynninghame.

   Poor.-By the Session Book of Tynninghame, it appears
that a scheme was proposed in 1745 by the Justices of the
Peace, and Ministers of this county, for erecting a general
work-house for the maintenance of the poor of the county.
The session did not accede to the proposal, as this parish is
furnished with poor-houses of its own sufficient to lodge, and
funds to maintain its own poor.  The number of poor in
the parish not great; they are maintained by the weekly
collections, and the interest of 511 L. 10 s. 2 3/4 d. mortified to
the session.  There is also 70 L. more mortified to them, but
the interest is still paid to the sister of the mortgager.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The extent of the sea cost is
about three miles.  In the north part of the parish there is
a number of rocks, which have been very fatal to mariners
at different times.  Within these two years several vessels
have been wrecked there; and, to the honour of some of
the farmers in the neighbourhood, every exertion was made
to save the unhappy sufferers and their effects, though, it
must be confessed, the humanity of some of the lower class
of people was not so very conspicuous on such awful occa-
sions.
