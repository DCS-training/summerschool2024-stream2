repair.  Seven vessels belong to it, measuring from 400 to
500 tons, and manned by about 30 seamen, including ap-
prentices.  They are chiefly employed in carrying to Lon-
don the produce of our manufactures, the fish of our river,
and skins of goat, deer, roe, fox, hares, rabbits, and otter,
with other articles.  They bring in return materials both for
use and for luxury.  There are 9 boats manned by 6 men each.

   Manufactures.-There are 2 tanneries and 1 tawing
work in the town.  The tanned leather is consumed at
home; but the tawed is lent to London.  These manufac-
tures do not indeed employ many hands, but they are very
beneficial to this country.  There are 2 tallow-chandlers
and 1 soap-boiler.  These two do much work with few
hands.  There is a brick work in the neighbourhood of the
town.  This work is only in its infancy.  The duty on
the thousand is a dead weight on this work; 1 s. on the 1000
would raise a much greater revenue.  A hemp manufac-
ture was established here above 30 years ago.  This busi-
ness at present employs, in spinning, dressing and weaving,
above 1000 men, women and children.  They earn from
1 s. to 10 s. a-week.  The hemp is imported from the Bal-
tic, and is manufactured into all kinds of cloth for bags,
sacking and tarpallin, consumed in Britain, and in the E.
and W. Indies.  A white and coloured thread manufacture
is now established here about 10 years.  This business em-
ploys, in heckling, spinning, twisting, bleaching and dyeing,
near 10,000 persons, including men, women and children.
They earn from 1 s. 6 d. to 2 s. a-week.  The company
have in this and the neighbouring counties nineteen agents to
manage the spinning departments.  The flax is imported
from the Baltic, and when manufactured sent to London,
from whence it is dispersed over the world.  There is on
the Ness an infant bleach field.  It has many advantages, and
promises to do well.
