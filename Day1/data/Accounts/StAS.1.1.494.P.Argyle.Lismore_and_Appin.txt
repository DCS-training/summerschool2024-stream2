with in the Isle of Skye, and on the western coast of Scot-
land, and which Dr Johnson, contrary to the general opi-
nion, ridiculously asserts to have been erected for preserving
the cattle from the depredations of thieves in the night-time.
These towers have been probably intended, partly at least,
for raising beacons or fires on them, to alarm the coast
and country, on the approach of enemies.  For this rea-
son, the greatest care has been always taken to place them in
a situation commanding a most extensive view, so as to be
seen from the neighbouring towers and heights.  In construct-

mortar of any fort is used.

   Curiosities.-The prodigious strata of marl, from 10 to 16
feet deep, in the bottoms of all the lakes in Lismore, may
be ranked among the curiosities in this parish.  There is
in this island, in the face of the ground, and quite beyond the
reach of tides, a seam, 12 or 15 inches broad, of a concre-
tion, composed of all the varieties of shells to be found on
these coasts, with now and then a small mixture of charcoal,
as firm, and nearly as solid, as the rock surrounding it, to
which it seems to be perfectly united, and to make a part.
Pieces of it have been carried to Edinburgh.  Water running
over the face of the lime-stone rocks in this island generally
dissolves softer particles of it, and leaves the more solid parts
in a variety of fanciful grotesque figures.

   The lime-stone rocks in Lismore lie all in one direction, in
layers, one above another, nearly from south-east to north-
west.  There are seams of spars three of four feet broad, of
remarkably hard flinty rocks or stones running across the
island, at the distance of 1 1/2 or 2 miles.  These seams appear
