are great aid.  Glenmorishton seems a proper station for a
society mission.  The service is chiefly in Gaelic, the pre-
vailing language of the country, but in Urquhart, especial-
ly in the summer months.  English is also preached; but sel-
dom in Glenmoriston.  Sir James Grant of Grant, Baro-
net, is patron of the parish, which lies in the presbytery of
Abertarf, and synod of Glenelg.  Till the year 1724, that
the above synod and presbytery were erected, Urquhart
belonged to the presbytery of Inverness, and synod of Mo-
ray, which would be much more convenient  for the incum-
bent than the present arrangement.
   The stipend, by decreet in 1796, is L . 100, and L. 5 for
communion-elements. The glebe is about fix acres of
good land.  The manse is ruinous, but the minister resides
in a comfortable lodging of Sir James Grant's, and the he-
ritors allow him L. 20 a-year in lieu of a manse.
   There are two schools in Urquhart, the parochial, and
one supported by the Society for Propagating Christian
Knowledge.  The parochia school is within half-a-mile of
the church.  The salary is L. 14 per annum, with a house,
the emoluments of precentor and session-clerk, with the
quarter-payments from scholars, are  about L. 10; total
L. 24.-Quarterly payments are , 1 s. for reading English;
1 s. 6 d. for reading and writing; and 2. s. when arithmetic
is taught.  There is no Latin taught.
   The Society school is in the Braes of Urquhart; the sala-
ry L. 10, with L. 4 more to the schoolmaster's wife, as a
sewing-mistress.  Besides these, the country finds them in a
house, garden, cow's grass, and fuel, and a little is made of
the quarter-payments; but, all put together, the encou-
ragement is greatly too small.  The Society intend erect-
ing another school at Bunleold, on the south side of Urqu-
