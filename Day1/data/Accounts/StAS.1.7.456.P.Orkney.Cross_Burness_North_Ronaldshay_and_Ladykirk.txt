     Statistical Account

   Tides and Shoals.-The tide of flood sets eastward, and that
of ebb westward, with some variation occasioned by the re-
sistance it meets with either from shoals or head-lands.  Its
velocity on the west end of Sanday is 6 miles in the hour.
There is a tide sets on the north side of Sanday, 14 days in
one direction.  The shoal of Rinnabreck on the north side
of Sanday is two miles from the shore; and tradition says it
was formerly united to the island, and that the people used
to play at the foot ball on it.  It has been long an opinion,
that a light-house might be of service on the east coast of
these islands; and the trustees, by order from government,
have at last erected one, two years ago, on the north-east
point of the isle of North Ronaldshay, of the height of 70 feet.
By the report of some captains, they have already been bene-
fited by it.  Some are of opinion, it might have been of
more service on the Start, or east point of Sanday.  Time
will show if it diminishes the number of wrecks; for in time
past, these islands have been as fatal to shipping, as the isle
of Providence, and others of the Bahama islands in the West
Indian Archipelago*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*That a light house was necessary will best appear from the
following lift of shipping wrecked for the last 18 years, with the
supposed value of ship and cargo.  Some of the names are not
recollected, but that is not material if we can ascertain the va-
lue nearly.
