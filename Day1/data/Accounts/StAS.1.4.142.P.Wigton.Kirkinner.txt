of ground for houses and gardens, with sometimes from 12
to 20 acres, for tillage and pasture.  So that the increase
of inhabitants in that time, seems to be nearly 200.  There
are 10 weavers, 7 tailors, 7 carpenters, 3 shoemakers, 10
household servants.  Besides the married servants above
mentioned, I reckon one male and two female servants for
each of the 50 farmers, and a boy between 12 and 16
years of age.  The other 20, who possess very small farms,
have the work of the farm chiefly performed by themselves
and their children.  There are Irish families about 27, and
9 or 10 single men, employed as day-labourers.  Not one
half of the inhabitants, above the age of 20 years, have

2 of whom only reside; one writer; neither physician,
surgeon, nor apothecary.  There are between 90 and 100
Seceders, 6 or 7 Roman Catholics from Ireland, and the
rest of the inhabitants of the Established Church.  There
are not quite five inhabitants to a house.
   Between 40 and 50 persons emigrated from this parish
to America, in the year 1775, with a view to settle there
as planters or artisans.

   Agriculture, etc.-The summer stock of black cattle,
which is the chief article, without reckoning calves, may
may be about 2700.  They are of a very good kind gene-
