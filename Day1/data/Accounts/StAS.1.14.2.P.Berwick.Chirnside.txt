     Statistical Account

Merse and Tiviotdale, consisted of only four presbyteries;
viz. that of Kelso, Dunse, Chirnfide and Jedburgh.

   It has no natural and well marked boundaries.  The
large stream of Whittadder, or Whitewater, terminates it 
upon the S., and a deep morass, called Bellymire, is its
confine, in the opposite quarter.  The elevated and ex-

panded hill of Chirnside, and the contiguous one of Iding-
ton, when taken together with their wide skirts, may be
reckoned as comprehensive of the whole parish.  The fi-
gure is oval, and its longest line, extending eastward from
Whittadder bridge to the extremities of Foulden and Ay-
ton parishes, is computed to measure 3 1/2 English miles,
or under 4.  Its greatest breadth will hardly reach to 3.
upon a calculation, the number of acres in the parish,
will amount to about 6523.  The whole land, if we ex-
cept 5 or 6 small portions, consists now of 5 estates; two
of which, Chirnside and Idington, are separate baronies,
and both of considerable antiquity*.
   The lands of Ninewells are next in valuation after
Idington.  The 4th estate, called East Mains, and hold-
ing of the barony, is the property of John Molle, Esq.,
a lineal descendant of an old family of that name in Ti-
viotdale, and parish of Morbattle.  The 5th is that of
Blackburn in the Mire, the property of Mrs. Bruce, the

*The former, to which the largest territory belongs, had, probably,
become an appendage of the lordship of Home, when the chief of that
family, Lord Warden of the East March, after being engaged in the re-
volt of Francis, Earl of Bothwel, had returned to his duty, and obtain-
ed, as his share in that forfeited chieftain's spoils, a grant of the Abbey
of Coldingham, anno 1596.  The donation would involve claims to, or,
at least, facilitate the acquisition of lands of Ninewells appear, from the
charters, not to hold of the barony of chirnside, but of the lordship of
Home.
