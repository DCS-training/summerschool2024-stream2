were the object of the farmer's ambition, being safe from the fogs
and hoar-frost which infested the lower grounds; and the harvests
being generally early and always safe, the grain from the Brae of
Fordoun was in constant demaind for seed-corn, and generally
fetched a high price ; thus, what produced bankruptcy and ruin to
the How farmer, at that period, brought wealth and independence
to him of the Braes. Times are altered. Draining is now under-
stood, and has been so successfully practised, that not a bog, loch,
or swamp, remains in the parish. Deep strong clays are in de-
mand ; their value is understood; and, by the judicious application
of lime and other manures, their powers of production are com-
pletely developed. At the period alluded to, agues were common,
but such a disease is now scarcely known. There cannot be said
to be any prevailing distempers.

	Of the 258 persons who have died in the parish during the last
seven years, 107 were of the age of 70 or above it, and more than
half of the whole number was 60 or above that age. One woman,
who died in 1834, was married fifty-five years. Her husband and all
her family, four in number, are still alive. One of the persons who
died in 1834 was 98, another 93, and the third 92 years of age.
        Rivers.--Two or three small streams take their rise in the
Grampian district. The most westerly of these is the burn of
Craigniston, which forms, for some distance, the west boundary of
the parish, and divides it from Fettercairn. It is a mere rivulet,
and can be stept across at any point before it leaves the parish.
The next stream to the eastward is the Ferdun. This stream or
rivulet rises in the Grampians, and is formed by two small burns
that unite at Clattering Briggs. After running along the west side
of Strathfinella bill, it continues in a southerly direction, until it
falls into the Luther belOw Thornton. Luther Water takes its rise
