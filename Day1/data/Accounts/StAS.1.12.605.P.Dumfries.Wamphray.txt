   Great improvements have been made in agriculture within
the last 10 years. These are in a great measure owing to
the encouragement given by the Earl of Hopetoun.  Most of
his Lordship's lands were let last year upon leases, for the
arable farms, of 21 years, for the sheep farms, of 14.  None
of the former tenants were removed.  They are, in general,
very active intelligent, and by the use, not only of lime,
but of green and drilled crops, keep the land in excellent
condition.  Little or no lime was used till of late:  last year
above 2000 bushels were laid on, all brought from a distance
of at least 16 miles.  Several farms are well enclosed, mostly
with thorn hedges*.  There is one corn-mill in the parish:
by the last leases, the tenants are relieved from the payment
of multure+, and the miller is now paid for his work, about
a thirtieth part of the meal.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The common wages of a man-
servant, are from 6 L. to 8 L. a-year; of a woman, from 2 L. 10 s.
to 4 L.  A considerable quantity of salmon is killed in the
Annan, with an instrument resembling a trident, called a
liester, in the use of which, some of the young men are very
expert.  They often fish in winter, and in the night by torch
light, not scrupling to follow the salmon in the water in the
time of frost and snow.  These fish are sold at an average, at
2 1/3 d. the pound.
   The belief in witches and apparitions seems to have pre-
vailed here to a wonderful degree, about a hundred years ago.
