the emigration is completed, which may be supposed to be
about 38 or 40, as to males, and about 28 or 30, as to females,
yet sufficient data are given for making it correct, first, by add-
ing the number of emigrants to the radices for each year, till
the emigration commences, and afterwards deducting, along
with the deaths, the proportion of emigrations thought nearest the
truth; when all are subtracted, the numbers living and dying
will coincide with the Table.  The number of persons living,
of all ages, by the corrected Table, (after deducting the half of
the births), divided by 30, (the number of years), will then
be equal to the number of inhabitants: thus,
