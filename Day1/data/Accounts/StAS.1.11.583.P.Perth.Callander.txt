Earl of Mar, for the estate of Alloa, which was then in the pos-
session of the crown, having been forfeited by Baliol, the unsuc-
cessful competitor for the royalty.  The next are LOCH-ACHRAY,
contracted for Loch a-chravy, i.e.  the Lake of the Field of De-
votion, Achray being the name of a farm on its banks, where
probably the Druids had a place of worship, and LOCH-VAN-
A CHOIR, the Lake of the white or fair Valley.  The name of
a farm on the south side is the Fair Valley.  This whiteness is
different from that ascribed to Glen-sin-glass; and different
words are used to denote them with more precision.  The
former implies the whiteness of daizies, or the fair appearance
of the summer's clothing; the latter is descriptive of the
bleached whiteness of long winter grass; an accuracy of ex-
pression to which many languages are strangers, however much
improved.  These three lakes form a chain, connected by short
intervals, of a most beautiful river, lined with a variety of
natural wood, and leading from Callander to the romantic view
at the end of Loch-Catherine.

NAN-CORP, the Small Lake of dead Bodies, which got its name,
from a whole company attending a funeral having dropt
through the ice, and being drowned, when passing from Glen-
fin-glass to the chapel of St. Bridget*.  On the north side of
Benledi, lies LOCH-LUB-NAIG, the crooked or winding Lake
which, in the distance of 4 miles, forms two or three fine
sweeps, on the great road to Fort William.  About the middle
of this lake, there is a tremendous rock, called CRAIG-NA-CO-
HEIG, the Rock of the Joint Hunting, which is the boundary
between two estates, and a common name given in the High-

*The most numerous clan, in this devoted company, were the KESSANACHS,
who were formerly a considerable people in this country; but since this disaster
