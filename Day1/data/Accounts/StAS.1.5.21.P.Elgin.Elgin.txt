The individual, who occupies such a farm, having fewer
mouths to maintain, can afford, perhaps, a greater rent, than
what many families, on the same surface of ground, could
pay at once.  But the population being thus greatly dimi-
nished, the value of the property may, in process of time,
suffer by it.  Numbers, made superfluous by this measure, 
flock into towns, where with difficulty, they earn a scanty
subsistence.  They, no doubt, increase the population of
these towns; but towns, on almost any scale, are adverse to
either the keeping up, or the increasing of numbers.  A
country life was the original destination of man, is the most
favourable to wealth and population, and ought, on every
account, to meet with all possible encouragement and protec-
tion.  The most favourable size of farms to make a country
populous, is from 15 to 40 acres of arable land.  The oc-
cupiers of such farms marry early, as they have the prospect
of bread, if they are industious.  But when farms are over-
grown, they are mostly inhabited by servants and day-la-
bourers; and every measure is tried to keep wages and the
price of labour low, by which marriage is discouraged.
Day-labourers then become afraid of marrying, and servants
very seldom can; and thus the numbers of a healthy peasan-
try are daily diminished.
   5. These circumstances also lead to emigration, and to this
it may be added, that incited by the prospect of making a
fortune, as it is called, the flower of our young men, of every
class and description, go abroad; and for one, who returns
in comfortable situation, and raises a family, how many
hundreds, I had almost said thousands, drop by the road.
Their wealth, however accumulated, cannot surely compen-
sate for the loss of so many citizens; indeed, scarcely re-
paying the original expence of fitting them out.
