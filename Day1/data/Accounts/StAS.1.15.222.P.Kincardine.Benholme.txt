October.  A greater quantity of every sort of grain is raised
within this parish than is necessary for its support.  The prin-
cipal extraneous manure made use of here is lime, which is
chiefly brought by land carriage, from a quarry in the parish
of St Cyrus, not two miles distant.  Many farmers, however,
find their account in importing it from the Frith of Forth,
and even from Sunderland.  All agree that it is an essential
requisite in farming.  Forty bolls have commonly been al-
loted to an acre; but many begin to think that a much great-
er proportion is necessary for strong land.

   Ploughs, Cattle, etc.-There are from 36 to 40 ploughs
in this parish.  About 6 of these are drawn by oxen, which
are chiefly made use of where the land is rugged.  When
it is in an improved state, horses are employed, and 2 are
thought sufficient for a plough.  The Scotch plough is gene-
rally used here, and seems best adapted to the nature of the
soil; though several Norfolk wheel-ploughs are employed
with advantage on such farms as are free from stones, and in
a high state of cultivation.  Considerable attention is bestow-
ed on rearing, but very little on feeding black-cattle, though
the demand for butcher meat daily increases.  Nor has this
inducement hitherto prevailed on the farmer to feed more
sheep than is necessary for the use of his own family.

   Rents, Inclosures, Leases, etc.-By a survey of the county,
taken in 1774, this parish contains 4721 English acres, of
which nearly a fifth part is uncultivated.  The rest is divid-
ed into 20 farms.  Twelve of these yield from 50 L. to 210 L.
the other 8 from 20 L. to 50 L. Sterling of yearly rent.  The
best arable land is let at from 1 L. to 1 L. 17 s. an acre: And,
when it is divided into small portions, from 2 L. to 2 L. 6 s.
Land of an inferior quality is not let by the acre, but by the
