   "I am farther convinced, that early inoculation proves a

   "I have thus far continued to give my opinion, collected
from practice, with the sole view of introducing the most
favourable mode of inoculation, and to preserve, from so
fatal a disease, many of a valuable race (the Highlanders of
Scotland.)"
   "Pursuing this view, which I flatter myself, in this coun-

   "It must readily appear, that inoculation is not so far un-
derstood by every head of a family, as to convince them
they ought to adopt Dr Brown of Edinburgh's plan.  A
