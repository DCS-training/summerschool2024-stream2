more important discoveries. As yet, however, nothing has been
ascertained which can warrant us to affirm with precision, that
under the cairn were deposited the ashes of a once renowned but
now forgotten hero.
   It may not be uninteresting to add, that in the church, which
was demolished previous to ttie erection of the present edifice,
there was a statue of rude workmanship, with the beads employed
by Roman Catholics attached to the hands. This relic of anti-
quity lay for many years on the site of the former church; but,
in consequence of directions given by the late Earl of M`nsfield,
it was at last removed to the Castle of Balvaird. This statue, it
is supposed, was formed in honour of Margaret Barclay, spouse
of Sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird, who, in 1527, as already
stated, founded and endowed a chaplainry in the church of Arn-
gask.

                    III.-POPULATION.

   When the census was taken by Dr Webster in 1755, the popu-
lation amounted to 736, but in 1790, when the last Statistical Ac-
count was drawn up, it had decreased to 554. By the Parliamen-
tary census of 1801, it was found to be 564, and by that of 1831
it amounted to 712. The Government census of 1841 repre-
sents the population at 750, of whom there are 380 males, and
370 females. By a minute numerical survey which the incum-
bent took in 1839, the total number of inhabitants was ascertained
to be 724.

   From the number of baptisms registered, it is obvious that the
population, during the first half of the last, century, was fully as
great as it is at present. The diminution which took place dur-
irig the second half of the century appears to have been occasion-
ed chiefly by the removal of cottages, and by converting, at least in
One instance, several small pendicles or farms into one. Candy,
during that period, consisted of four distinct farms,, with an equal
number of cottages, and thus afforded acccommodation for eight fa-
