on the east side and neighbourhood of the hill, between Oli-
ver Cromwell, and the Scotch army under Leslie's command. 
From this strong entrenchment Leslie was persuaded, con-
trary to his own opinion, to come down,-was defeated by 
Cromwell, who was just about to embark his troops at 
Dunbar for want of provisions, and pursued with great 
slaughter.  Musket bullets, swords, human bones, and pie-
ces of scarlet cloth, are still found in the neigbouring 
fields; many of the killed were buried in and about Spott-
dean.  The Edges of Lammermuir are beautifully skirted 
with natural wood, the property of Mrs Hamilton of Bel-
haven, consisting chiefly of oak and hazel.  There is a range 
of 4 beautiful small lochs in her property; in one of which, 
called the Black Loch, are excellent pike.-The farm of 
Spott, formerly let to three, is now in lease to one farmer. 
New houses are intended to be built by Mr Hay of Spot, 
in place of old ones now in runs, and others are to be re-
paired.
