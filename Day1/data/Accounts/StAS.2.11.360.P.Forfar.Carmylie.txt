pulation respectively of 75, 51, and 48, amounting in all to 174;
consequently, 979 of the population are scattered over the other
districts of the parish.
	The annual average of births for the last seven years may be stated
at 30; of marriages, 11. The annual average of deaths cannot be
very accurately stated, as there is no register of deaths kept here;
judging, however, from the amount of dues received for the use of
the mortcloth, the annual average of burials, for the above period,
may be stated at 13. *

        Customs, &c. of the People-There are but few popular customs,
games, amusements to be noticed, as peculiar to this parish or
neighbourhood, with the exception, however, of the nld custom of
penny weddings, which has been revived within the last twenty
years, among the poorer classes. This is much to be regretted, as
such assemblages can scarcely be said to be favourble either to

<FOOTNOTE>The annual average of death perhaps exceeds that number, as some are buried
in neighbouring parishes; and reckoning the annual average of deaths at 16 for
the last seven years, the annual excess of births for that time would be 14; and had
there been the same excess for the three years preceding, the population since the
last census must have recieved an addition of 140, whereas the actual addition during
that time is only 81. This is to be accounted for from the number of those who
leave the parish annualy as servants and labourers, exceeding the number of those
who come into it annually from other parishes.
