If it is wished to be known what the yearly
  value of these islands is to the proprietors,
  it only remains to add the value of the kelp.
  As there are 500 tons usually made in the
  isle of Sanday, and only 130 tons let in lease 
  with the lands, it remains to state, for 370
  tons at 3 l. per ton neat supposed profit on
  each ton, after paying for making it, freight
  and charges.  Say then for 370 tons made
  in the isle of Sanday for proprietors at 3 l.
  per ton,                                           1110   0  0

But to ascertain the yearly value of these islands,
  we ought to replace here the 162 l. 10 s.
  Sterling above discounted from the rent for
  130 tons kelp shores, supposed to be let in
  lease with the lands to four farmers in San-
  day.  Say then 162 l.  10 s.                        162  10  0
                                                     -----------
Full yearly value of these islands, both for rent
