			PARISH OF PANBRIDE.

	  PRESBYTERY OF ARBROATH, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	       THE REV. DAVID TRAIL, D. D. LINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Boundaries.--THE name of the parish is evidently
connected with St Bridget; and it is more than probable that the
prefix Pan is derived, not from the Latin word fanum, a church,
as has been supposed by some, but from the Celtic word pallin or
ballin, signifying a town or hamlet. The historian Buchanan
accordingly calls the parish Balbride, which signifies St Bride's
town.
	The parish is fully more than five miles long in the direction of
north-west to south-east, by about two broad. It is bounded by
the sea on the south; by the parishes of Barry and Monikie on
the west; by Carmylie on the north; by Arbirlot on the north-east;
and by a detached part of St Vigeans on the south-east.
	Topographical Appearances.--The general appearance of the
parish and immediate neighbourhood is rather flat than hilly; but
there is a considerable declivity for some miles from the north to
the south throughout the whole line of country between Dundee
and Arbroath. The sea shore, which bounds the parish, is flat
and very rocky, with a considerable accumulation of gravel along
the margin of the water, among which a variety of pebbles is to
be found fit for the lapidary.
	It is evident, from the state of the coast in this quarter, that
formerly the ocean must have covered a great part of vh`t is now
dry and solid land; for along our shores a succession of banks
may be traced, composed of sand and gravel; which must have been
the boundaries of the sea at different and probably very widely
separated periods. There are, indeed, a few partial inroads by the
sea at various places; but these are trifling, and must have been
occasioned merely by the dashing of the waves against the softer
banks during the storms of winter.
