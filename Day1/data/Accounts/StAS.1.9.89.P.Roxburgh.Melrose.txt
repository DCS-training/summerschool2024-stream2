stone wall, reaching from the south corner to the west cor-
ner of the Tweed, where the neck of land is narrow; and
the foundations of the wall are still to be seen.  I do not
think there has been any great building about it; for as Bede
acquaints us, their churches then were all of oak, and co-
vered with reeds.  The situation of the place is most plea-
sant and agreeable, being almost surrounded by Tweed,
and having a fine prospect towards Gladswood.
   About a mile to the west of this on the Tweed, stands
the village of Newstead, a place remarkable for another
abbey on the east side of it, called Red Abbey-steed.
   About half a mile from Newstead, on the same south
side of the Tweed, stands the present Abbey of Melrose.  It
is famous for its monastery, which was very large and spa-
cious, as appears from the ruins of it yet remaining; one
of the most magnificent in the kingdom; and continues still
to be the admiration of strangers, who, in respect of the
height and embellishment of its columns, with all kind of
sculpture, the beauty of its stones, and symmetry of its parts,
reckon it one of the best of the Gothic structures they have
seen.  It was founded by King David in 1136; dedicated to
the Virgin Mary, and endowed with large revenues and ma-
ny immunities, as appears by the charters granted to the ab-
bot and convent, by our kings.  The monks were Cister-
tians, and the monastery of Melrose was a mother church
or nursery for all of that order, in many various and remote
regions of Scotland.
   The church is built in the form of St John's cross.  The
chancel, which is a very stately fabric, is still standing; its
roof is very curious, and has much of the scripture history
upon it.  I have taken the measure of what is standing of
this church, although much of the west part is so entirely
demolished, that we cannot know how far it has reached
in that direction.  Its just length is 258 feet; breadth 137 1/2;
