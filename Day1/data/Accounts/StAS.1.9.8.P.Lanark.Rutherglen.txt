There are no fewer than 22 tambouring machines in the
town; 4 young girls commonly work at each; and gain,
by their united labour, about 2 s. the day.

   Minerals.-The coal-works carried on at Stonelaw, by
Major John Spens, are of long standing.  There is no ac-
count when coals were at first wrought in this place.  But
from the number of old wastes, the period must be very
remote.  At present, about 126 persons are employed in
the works.  The water is raised by a steam-engine, which,
about the year 1776, was erected by Gabriel Grey, Esq;
of Scotstown.  The coals turned out are of different qua-
lities, but all of them are very good.  They are sold on
the hill at 10 d. the hutch, weighing 400 lb. but it com-
monly exceeds that weight; carriage to Glasgow is 4 d.
so that a cart load of three hutches, weighing about 13
cwt. is laid down in the street for 3 s. 6 d.  But two
wheeled waggons, containing 6 hutches, are commonly u-
sed.  Some of them that lately were occasionally weighed,
contained no less than 33 cwt. of sort coal; which, how-
ever, is specifically heavier than hard coal.  The empty
waggon generally weighs about 8 1/2 cwt.  The whole, a-
mounting to 41 cwt. is drawn by a single horse, which
goes to Glasgow three times a day.  Glasgow is distant
from Stonelaw 3 1/2 miles.  Such heavy draughts, drawn by
one horse, even for a greater length of road, is not unfre-
quent in this country.  The waggon is generally 2 feet
in depth; 3 1/2 in breadth; and 5 1/2 in length; the wheels
are 4 1/2 in height; the horses employed are of the Lanark-
shire breed.  Their superior excellency, after the above
mentioned exertion of their strength, to which they are
daily accustomed, need not be called in question.  A con-
siderable quantity of iron stone is turned out along with
