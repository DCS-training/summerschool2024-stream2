to send their collection, when they do not choose to come to
church, the poor's funds would be equal to their expendi-
ture.

   Wages.-The wages of day labourers and hired servants,
are perhaps as high, in this corner, as in any part of Scot-
land.  This is no doubt owing to the flourishing state of ma-
nufactures in the neighbourhood.  Day laboure.s, in the win-
ter season, get 1 s. a day; in spring and summer 15 d.; and
in autumn, frequently 18 d  The average of male servants,
for the year, is 9 L.  Sterling; of females, 4 L. which is more
than the double of what they received 20 years ago.  The
mode of living is much altered to the better; but the mode
of dress is far superior to what it was then, amongst both
fexes.

   Bridges.-At the conflux of the rivers White Cart and
Grise, there is a very fine bridge, consisting of 10 large
arches.  A large arch is thrown over, from about the center
of the bridge to the high-way that leads to Paisley.  When
built, a toll was laid upon all passengers, to defray the ex-
pence, and the management of it was committed to trustees.
In 1782, it rented for 377 L. Sterlin.  This tax was taken
off in 1787.

   Antiquities.-Upon the north side of the parish, near the
river Clyde, stood the Palace of Inchinnan; one of the seats
of the noble family of Lennox.  It was built in the begin-
ning of the 16th century.  There are many people still
living, who remember to have seen part of its ruins; but
now, there is not the least vestige of them remaining.
