of the poor of this parish depend entirely on the session for main-
tenance,- the most of them shewing a most laudable desire to do
all in their power towards their own support; and in cases of total
inability through age or sickness, the relatives of the poor are ge-
nerally ready to extend a helping hand to relieve their wants, and
to prevent their becoming a  burden on the parish. The funds at
the disposal of the session, arising from church collections, rent of
land, and interest of invested money, amounting, at an average,
after deducting the usual burdens, L. 55 Sterling, are distribut-
ed annually; of course, the allowance to e`ch cannot be more
than a mere trifle ; still it is in almost every case thankfully ac-
cepted. In cases of sickness and urgent want, occasional relief is
afforded out of the Sabbath collections, and that sometimes to
persons not on the poor's roll. When families in indigent circum-
stances happen to be visited with serious sickneoss, and death
makes breaches in their numbers, the sympathy of the parishioners
is promptly manifested in special collections for the relief of the
distressed.
   Inns.-The only Inn in the parish is one at Conan village, on
the great northern road, where it is quite necessary, and is very
well kept. Of dram-shops there are 3, which might be dispensed
with, without any inconvenience to the public, or detriment to the
morals of the inhabitants.
   Fuel.- The fuel chiefly used by the principal tenants is coals,
which is imported from Newcastle or Sunderland, and which can
be obtained at the average price of 15s. per ton. A considerable
number of the inhabitants use only a baked kind of peat, which is
found in a moss in the upper part of the parish. With the addi-
tion of a little fire-wood, which can be had at a very cheap price,
this peat makes a pretty good fire; and to coals, it is a great
and decided improvement.
