enough to demonstrate, that if man were active, nature would
be kind.
   The manufacture of tiles, a simple one, and easily carried
on, where there is abundance of clay and coal, is also an im-
provement that ought to be introduced, as it is easily acquir-
ed, and would save considerable sums of money, sent regular-
ly every year for that article to Glasgow.  By these means al-
so an essential benefit would redound to the farmers, whose
yearly expenditure, in straw and workmanship for their
thatched roofs, is very considerable; nor do they enjoy the
cleanliness or comfort, which they might derive from tiles.
If this article were within their reach, it would probably lead
to a total change in their mode of building, as they have a-
bundance of stone and lime at hand.  The country, at pre-
sent, is infested with rats, mice, and other vermin, which,
when they have once taken possession, can never be dislodged
from mud walls and thatched roofs.  The introduction of
buildings, impervious to such intruders, would be of consider-
able advantage to the farmer, by saving a great deal of his
grain from depredation*.
   The growing of wheat, to answer the demand of the place,
would, as has been already mentioned, save to the country
2000 L. per annum.  Those, who have raised this species of
grain in small quantities lament the inconvenience they are
subject to, by having no mill to grind it; but it is to be hop-

as to remove this cause of complaint.
   Raising green crops would also benefit the farmer, and the
town would soon be properly supplied with stall-fed butcher
meat, throughout the winter and spring; which at present,
