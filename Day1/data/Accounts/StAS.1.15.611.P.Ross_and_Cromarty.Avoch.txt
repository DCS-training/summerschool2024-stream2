     of Avoch.

   Avoch extends about 2 1/2 English miles from East to West,
and 4 from South to North, and is nearly of a rhoimboidal
form.  It is bounded by the parish of Rosemarky towards
the East; by the Moray Frith and that branch of same Frith
called Munlochy bay, on the South-East, South, and South-
West; by the united parishes of Kilmuir Wester and Suddie,
on the West; by Urquhart or Ferrintosh on the North West,
and by the united parishes of Cullicudden and Kirkmichael
on the North.  It marches with these last on the large hill
called Mulbuy, which extends nearly the whole length of the
Black Isle, from Cromarty to Beauley.

   Surface and Soil.-This parish consists chiefly of two ridges
of hills, of a moderate altitude, and pretty broad on the top,
running nearly parallel to each other, in a direction from East
to West, with a gently sloping vale on the North side of each,
and part of the Mullbuy, formerly mentioned, rising behind
all these towards the North.  So that it presents, in a manner,
three banks or faces to the beneficial influence of the south-
ern fun, and enjoys all the varities and advantages hill and
dale: The southern exposures being in general best adapted
for corn-farms; the northern, for wood, and the valleys, for
pasture.
   Almost every variety of soil is to be met with here.  To-
wards the shore it is light and sandy, as usual, particularly
in some of the lower grounds near the bay and sea town of
Avoch; where, on digging two or three feet deep, a stra-
tum of sea shells has been found in different places.  This
would seem to indicate that the Frith had once over-flowed
those grounds to a farther extent that it ever does now.  To
the Westward of this, on both sides of the Southern vale, the
soil is generally a light loam, or loam mixed with clay, fer-
