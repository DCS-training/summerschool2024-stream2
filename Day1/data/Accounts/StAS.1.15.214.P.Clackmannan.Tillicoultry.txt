   Antiquities.-There are few curiosities, or remains of an-
tiquity*.  The rude Druidical circle, on the south end of the
Cuninghar, deserves some small notice.  It is composed of
granites about 5 1/2 feet long, and its diameter is near 60 feet.
The spot was covered by the late proprietor, with a circular
thicket of Scotch firs, and is marked by Stobie, in his splen-
did map of Perth and Clackmannan shires.  On the
castle Craig, the foundations § of a round circular building
are still visible.

     This holy man had a ram,
     That he had fed up of a lam:
     And oysie hym til folow ay,
     Quhetevir he passit in his way.
     A theys this scheppe in Ackien stal,
     And et hym up in pecis smalle.
     Quhen Sanct Serf his ram had myst,
     Quha that it stal was few that wist:
     On presumption nevertheless,
     He that it stal arestyt was;
     And til Sanct Serf syne was he brought.
     That scheipe he said that he stal noueht;
     And tharfor, for to swer an athe,
     He said that he walde nocht be laythe.
     But some he worthit rede for schayme,
     The scheype that bletyt in his wayme.
     Swa was he taynetyt schamfully;
     And at Sanct Serf afkyt mercy.

*It is reported, there was a Roman station on the north end of the Cun
inghar.  About 50 years ago, the place was dug by order of Sir Robert
Stuart, and several urns, containing human bones, were found.

   ^Between these and the hills there has been a ditch by way of defence.
The vulgar tradition is, that the Pcyhts had a strong fortification in this
place, and that the stones of the edifice were carried away, when the castle
of Stirling was built.  A large stone coffin, neatly cemented with whitish
clay, was discovered about 8 years ago, in the midst of a great cairn or heap
of stone in Wertertown, anciently called Cairntown.  It was filled with fine
carth and contained two small bones.
