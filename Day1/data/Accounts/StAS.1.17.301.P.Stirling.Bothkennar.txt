A few poor scholars also have their school wages and books
paid from the same fund.

   Roads and Improvements.-The roads in this parish, which
old people remember to have been once scarcely passable,
are now in general good, unless for a short time during the
winter, when the ground is very wet, or when covered with
water, owing to the tide and land floods meeting together.
Within these few years, a considerable extent of ground has
been gained in this parish and neighbourhood from the Frith,
which, though defended at a great expence, will soon be-
come a valuable acquisition to its possessors.  There is a
bridge soon to be built over the river Carron, a little above
Grangemouth, and a new road to be carried from thence
across this parish, towards Alloa and Stirling, which are
likely to be of great advantage to the inhabitants, and will
open a nearer and more agreeable communication both to the
north and south.
