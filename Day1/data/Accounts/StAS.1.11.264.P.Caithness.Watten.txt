well prepared, they answer to their satisfaction.  The gene-
rality, however, of farmers are prejudiced against them, from
a belief that they are not so fruitful as either the black or
grey; besides being much more liable to be shaken.

   Agriculture.-Though this be the common plan of crop-
ping, it is nevertheless allowed, by every one skilled in farm-
ing, that our soil is exceedingly well adapted for green crops
of every kind.  And, upon trial, it has been found to be the
case.  For several years past, large fields have been laid down
in grass, turnips, pease and beans; all of which have answered
the most sanguine expectation.  Trial is making just now,
whether wheat may not be raised.  Eight bolls were sown
last season; and, though the winter has been very unfavour-
able, it promises fairly.  Hedges, too, have the appearance of
succeeding to advantage.  More vigorous healthy shoots could
not be desired, than those to be seen growing around the ditches
upon the Mains of Wattin.  About 20 years ago, the out-
lines of a large farm, on the S. side of the loch, were laid with
thorns; and, though totally neglected, both as to cleaning and
dressing, several chains lengths, without a breach, have come
to such perfection, as to be a sufficient fence against all kinds
of cattle.  The fields under culture are much infested, both
with top and root weeds.  But this is owing to the established
mode of farming, and not to any natural tendency in the soil,
The infield ground is perpetually under tillage.  One year,
a third part goes to bear, and the other two thirds to oats;
and so on, in constant rotation.  The smallness of their pos-
sessions, and the uncertain tenor by which they hold them,
prevents their attempting to fallow.  Indeed, they have little
inclination that way; nor will their present circumstances per-
mit them to undergo an immediate loss, for the prospect of
future gain.  Without stock to begin upon, very few ever
