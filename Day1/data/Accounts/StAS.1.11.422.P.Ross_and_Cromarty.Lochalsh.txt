     NUMBER XXXIII.

     PARISH OF LOCHALSH.

     (County of Ross-Presbytery of Lochcarron-Synod of
     Glenelg.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER DOWNIE, Minister.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THE general name of this parish, like those of most of
the farms of which it consists, seems to be Danish.  It
is situated on the N. W. coast of Scotland.  The figure of
the inhabited part approaches nearest to a quadrangular pen-
insula, being inclosed by the sea on 3 of the sides.  The
Kyle, or narrow sea, which separates the adjacent island of
Sky from the main land of Scotland, is its western boundary;
the bays of Lochduich and Lochlong encompass it on the S.;
and that range of high hills, which divides the east from the
west coast of Scotland, bound it on the east.  The inhabited
part is computed to be 10 miles long, and 5 broad.
