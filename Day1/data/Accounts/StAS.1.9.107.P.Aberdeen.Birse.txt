dle ridge.  The most northerly ridge takes its rise at Inch-
bair, and terminates at Cairnferg.  On the W. of the pa-
rish are the hills of Birsemore, Deuchry, and Mount Ga-
niach, which is the highest hill in the parish.  Indeed,
Mount Battach, or the north side of it, is claimed as belong-
ing to Birse.  Its height by Garden's map of the county of
Kincardine, is 1150 yards above the level of the sea.
Mount Battach is considerably higher than Mount Ganiach,
which is conjectured to be about 1000 above the level of
the sea.  Peter-hill and Mulbrax are next in height to
Mount Ganiach, and may be rated at 900 yards.  Cairn-
ferg, which is a remarkably conspicuous conical mount,
may be about 700 yards.  The rest of the hills fall gra-
dually lower in their respective ridges northward and east-
ward, till the ridge enters the parish of Strachan, or termi-
nates at the river Dee.  There has been no map or distinct
measurement of this parish.  The height of the hills cannot
therefore be exactly specified.  In Garden's map, the situa-
tion of part of this parish may be seen.  All the hills are
rocky and covered with heath, inter persed with pasture,
straths and green vallies.  There on the Grampian hills
our frugal swains do literally feed their flocks.  The hills
produce a variety of herbs, the names and virtues of which
we cannot pretend to specify; also many forts of berries,
the blue berry, cranberry, cloudberry; in rocky places,
the bramble, rasp, and strawberry of a small size.  The
hills also abound with moss; it is indeed inexhaustible, but
of difficult access.  In the mosses situated in the lower
grounds of the parish are dug up the remains of old oaks,
which appear to have been of a prodigious size.  In the
hill mosses the fir is found, commonly the root, and some-
times the whole tree, as fresh as if fallen yesterday, al-
though it has been buried hundreds, perhaps thousands of
years.  The oaks are not quite so fresh.  The hills also a-
