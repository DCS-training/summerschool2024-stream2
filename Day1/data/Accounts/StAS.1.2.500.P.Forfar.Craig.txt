   Castles and Forts.-There were, in this parish, two castles,
that of Black Jack on the sea shore, formerly the residence of
the family of Dunninald, of which, by the falling of the rock,
there are harldly any remains; and the castle of Craig, which
was demolished not many years ago  At the extremity of the
parish; to the east, where the Southesk falls into the sea, there
are the remains of an earthen fort, in the form of a square;
each side of which was about 50 feet; the walls 16 feet thick,
and, formerly, as high, or higher than a man's head.  With-
in, there was a house, for the purpose of affording shelter to
the men, and holding stores or ammunition.  Without the
square, and facing the mouth of the river, there was a breast-
work of earth, where cannon had been planted, to defend the
entrance of the river.  Tradition reports, that it had been
made use of in Oliver Cromwell's time; but whether erected
by him, or in more ancient times, cannot now be ascertained.
At this sort, some cannon were placed, so late as the 1745.-
About 20 years ago, the town of Montrose built, within this
square, a quadrangular tower, between 20 and 30 feet high,
for a land-mark, to direct vessels at sea; and, along the south
side of the river, at a small distance from one anothe, two co-
nical towers, or pillars, were lately erected by that town, for
directing vessels, when to take the river, with safety.

crease, in the population of this parish, for these many years
