the 20th of August to the middle of October.  Potatoes
planted in March, ready for digging about Lammas.  Crops
earlier near New Galloway, and along the Ken, than on
the moorish and westerly part of the parish, by several
weeks, and better filled.  Many farms are inclosed;  but
the great extent and barrenness of others, discourage the
attempt.  There are 32 farmers in the parish, each of
whom have one or more ploughs.  Several labouring men
have crosts and small possessions, and each have a plogh.
The old Scots plough, drawn by 4 horses abreast, is laid
aside, and a lighter one adopted.  They break up their 
ley-ground now with 3 horses instead of 4. and sometimes

are nearly 17,400 sheep; 1550 black cattle; 150 horses;
200 goats.  The farmers depend on the sale of their black
cattle, sheep and wool, for the means of paying their rent,
and supplying their families with what other articles of
provision and clothing they may need.  A small quantity
of cheese is exported.  The butter is all employed in
smearing sheep , and not sufficiesnt for that purpose.  There
is some imported from the west country, or from
England.-The land-rent is nearly L.3000 Sterling.  The

present there may be 20 acres.  It cannot be raised but by
lime or marl, and the distance of each is so great,as dis-
courages the farmers; the lime 20, and the marl 14 miles
distant.  The present minister was the first who brought
marl to the Glenkens; the project was laughed at, as too
expensive; but on seeing the rich crops it produced, amply
