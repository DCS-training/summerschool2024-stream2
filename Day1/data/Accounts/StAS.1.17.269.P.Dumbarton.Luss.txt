ved of their former shelter, they seldom thrive themselves,
and by their drop and shade hurt all the young growth a-
round them.  Prunning or lopping off great branches from
any of these ought carefully to be avoided.  Though the
scar may heal outwardly, yet it never fails to introduce rot-
tenness, less or more, into the heart, which hurts the timber,
and impairs the vigour of the tree.
   As to the arable and best grass grounds, the inclosing
them, as well as the woods, with a sufficient fence, is the
first great improvement of which they are capable.  Of what
kind the fence should be, nature, if attended to, will seldom
fail to direct.  In high and exposed situations, hedges will
not succeed; but there stones commonly abound.  In the
lower grounds, where stones are not plentiful, hawthorn
hedges may be raised with advantage.  But of all plants for
this purpose, holly promises to answer best.  Holly thrives
every where in this country, as in its native soil; and it
makes not only the most ornamental, but likewise the closest
and the best of hedges.  The time which it takes to raise
the plants from the seed, and the expence of getting them
from a nursery, is the great bar to the general use of them.
That bar might here be easily removed; the hollies which
grow wild in the woods, naturally lay their own branches,
which, as soon as they touch the ground, freely take root.
With a little assistance from art, a sufficient number of well
rooted plants could soon be got, which might safely be trans-
planted at such an age as to make almost an immediate
fence.
   The having the whole lands of a country engrossed into
a few hands, is certainly much against the public interest.
Every man, however, who depends entirely upon the pro-
duce of his fields, ought to have, at least, as much land as is
sufficient for affording himself and his family a comfortable
