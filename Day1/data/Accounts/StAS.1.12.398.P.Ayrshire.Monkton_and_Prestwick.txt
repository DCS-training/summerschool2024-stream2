part of it, it is an earthy clay, in the middle, deep and loamy, 
and, as it approaches the sea, is sandy and benty downs, that 
answer for the pasturing of young cattle; and, from saltness of 
the water, and warmth of the climate, judged conducive to 
the recovery of weak sheep.  Snow and frost are of short du-
ration in the winter, and the pasture open.  The grounds are 
mostly enclosed with ditch and hedge in the Monktown part 
of the parish, and properly subdivided into parks, with ex- 
tensive belts of planting.  In Prestick, the enclosures are few, 
the soil sandy, and the tenure by which they hold their free- 
doms unfavourable for such improvement, being subject to a 
revolution every 19 years, when, by a rule now established, 
they are to cast lots for the respective freedom each freeman 
is to possess.  The soil is better toward the E., where it joins 
the Newtown loch and St. Quivox.  The lower part next the 
village produces crops of rye, oats, and bear, which are good 
in wet seasons.  The soil there is found good for crops of po- 
tatoes, and might produce turnip.  The most of the enclosing 
and planting has been made within these 60 years, and there 
are people still alive, who remember when it began.  The 
ground rents paid by the tenants, at present, are generally 
from 25 s. to 35 s. and 40 s. the acre, and some pay more, 
Grass lets at 21 s. 25 s. and some 30 s. the acre.  The soil be-
ing light rich mould, naturally runs into grass and white 
clover, when fallow.  Before enclosing, some people remem- 
ber, that the highest rent for croft land was to merks Scots;

   Agriculture, etc.-The cultivation is usually 2 years oats,
then bear or barley laid down with grass-seeds, sometimes 
pease and beans, and afterward a crop of oats.  When the 
ground is laid down with grass-seeds, or, after cutting 1 or 
2 years, in hay, it usually lies in ley 4 or 6 years.  The
