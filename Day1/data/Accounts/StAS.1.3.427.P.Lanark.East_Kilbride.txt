   Diseases.-There is no epidemical distemper peculiar to
Kilbride.  The disease, that carries off the greatest number
of persons, about the middle period of it, is the consump-
tion.  Old people affirm, that, in their forefathers days, this
disorder was extremely rare, and seldom mortal.  The pro-
gress of the disease, in this country, is generally ascribe to
the change of clothing, from the thick and warm Scotish
plaiding, to the fine, but thin and cold English cloth, which
now so much prevails.  The small-pox sometimes rages with
great fury.  There were, in the year 1789, no fewer than
32 children in the parish seized with that loath some disorder,
and only 13, with difficulty, recovered. Inoculation, the
best remedy for that mortal contagion, meets here with a bad
reception.  Rooted prejudices, founded upon arguments,
some of which are trifling, and others absurb, influence the
minds of the people so much against it, that they sit still, in 
fullen contentment, and fee their children cut off in multi-
tudes.  It is to be hoped, however, that natural affection,
and a sense of duty, will at lenght get the better of unrea-
sonable prejudices; and that period is approaching, when
inoculation will be universally practised, by which the disease
will be greatly meliorated, or, perhaps, altogether eradicated.

   Church.-There are two places of worship in the parish;
the church, which was rebuilt in the year 1774, and a Re-

the living, which amounts, exclusive of manse and glebe, to
12 chalders of meal, paid in money, according to the fiars
of the commissariot of Humilton and Campsie.  The teinds
are paid to the University of Glasgow, who raise nearly 32
