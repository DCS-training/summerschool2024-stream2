     Statistical Account

   After all, the minister of Westray is very sensible, that
if any plan could be adopted here for establishing a poors
rate, this would lay the burden of the poor more equally
on the inhabitants of any parish, and more especially on
the rich landholders, who are unquestionably obliged to
assess themselves for the support of the poor, when the
public funds of a parish are insufficient for this purpose.

   Schools, etc.-With regard to the state of this parish as to
a school or schools for the education of youth, and their
instruction in Christian knowledge, it has been in a
very destitute condition for many years past.  In the year
1792, there was a teacher first sent from the Society for
Propagating Christian Knowledge; but he, upon obtaining
a better place in his own country, viz the county of Mo-
ray, left this parish a little before Whitsunday last.  By
another application to the Society for the continuance of
their bounty, there is some prospect of a school being again
established in this place, upon the same bounty, at Whit-
sunday first.  It must naturally occur to every thinking
and well-disposed mind, that the numerous youth in this
place must be in a very destitute condition for want of edu-
cation, when they grow up to men and womens estate
without being taught to read.  In a list of the number of
souls, which was accurately taken up in this parish two
years ago, the number of children at ten years and under
amounted to 360.  What is to be expected from children
thus trained up in ignorance, and deprived of the means of
religious knowledge in their youth?  It is too obvious to
make any comment upon it.  This is an evil which will
not be easily removed, without the interposition of public
aid, as many of the inhabitants are in very poor and indi-
gent circumstances.
