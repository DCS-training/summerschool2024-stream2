tant, and veryfew so far. It containas 1000 sittings, of which 216
are free. This number might be sufficient for the population at
the time the church was built, but is now altogether inadequate.
The want has been, in one view, supplied by the erection, in 1833,
of an elegant Relief chapel, calculated to contain 770 sittings, of
which 400 are let. There is, besides, in the village, a meeting-
house belonging to the Associate Synod, built in 1797, capable of
containing 470 hearers, and having 330 sittings let.
	The Established Church is generally well attended. Its joined
members are 900; the average number communicating annually,
600. In the Old Lightmeeting-house the joined members are 320;
number belonging to the parish communicating, 240. In the Re-
lief chapel, the average number of communicants is 500. * The
church collections foe charity are L.28 a-year; for extra parochial
objects about L.15 a-year In the Old Light, the collections for
congregational purposes are L.60 a-year; for charitable purposes,
L.7, 10s.; for extra-congregational objects, L.30. In the Relief,
the collections for congregational purposes are L.68 yearly; for
extra-congregational purposes, L.12.
	The manse was built in 1797, at an outlay of L.356. It has,
during the current year, been enlarged and repaired. The ex-
penditure for this purpose has been about L.170. The glebe
contains 11 acres of land, worth about L.3 an acre.
	In 1637, when the first allocation appears to have taken place,
the stipend of Carluke was 400 merks of money, and 4 chalders, of
meal. In 1650, it seems to have been modified and augmented
to 3 chalders of victual, two-thirds meal, and one-third barley, with
L. 51, 10s. 1d. Sterling in money. In 1774, an augmentation
was granted of L.31, 9s. 8d. In 1803, a further augmentation
was obtained of 2 chalders of victual, and L.1, 13s. 4d. in money,
making altogether 5 chalders of victual, with L.84, 15s. 1d. of
money. In 1819, the stipend was raised to 16 chalders of vic-
tual, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements at which it still
continues.
	The minister of the Associate Synod meeting-house receives
L.122 yearly with a good house and garden. His stipend is
raised from seat-rents, collections, and the rent of property. The
salary of the Relief minister is L.110, procured from seat-rents
and collections.

<FOOTNOTE>This number of 500 communicants, we must observe, is given solely on this au-
thority of those connected with the chapel.
