42, an. 1783; the highest is 84 in 1769.  It was 82 in
1721. In no other year of the century does the number a-
mount to 80.  The average of marriages is 15.  There was
no register of deaths kept before 1783, when the act of Par-
liament, imposing a tax upon burials, was thought to require
it.  The average, since that period, is 28; but as only those
interred in the parish are recorded, and many are carried to
neighbouring parishes for burial, the number of deaths might
be reckoned fron 34 to 36.  All the people, with the ex-
ception of 2 or 3, are, by profession, of the Established
Church.  A few years ago, there were 2 or 3 died here past
90.  There are none now quite 90, and few from 80 to 88.
There have been no emigrations from the parish; but seve-
ral young people go yearly to London, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Aberdeen, the West Indies, and North America, some of
whom have prospered well, and been of service to their re-
lations.  A good many go to the army, chiefly to regiments
who wear the Highland dress.  Hardly any go to the navy.
There are 12 merchants and shopkeepers in the town, and 80
tradesmen and artificers.

   Agriculture.-There is a good deal of flax and potatoes
raised, many acres sown with grasses, and some wheat and
rye; but the principal crops are, barley, oats, and pease.
The two last are sown in March and April; barley, from the
last week of April to the last week of May.  In a year ordi-
narily favourable, harvest begins about the middle of August,
and ends about the middle of October.  The corns raised
might be sufficient for bread to the inhabitants; but often
gentlemen exports all their victual rents, and the people of
the town get supplies from the neighbouring parishes.
