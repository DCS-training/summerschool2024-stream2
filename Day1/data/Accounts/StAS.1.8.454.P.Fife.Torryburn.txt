but there is a considerable quantity of yarn spun for the ma-

   Antiquities.-There are no natural curiosities in the parish,
and its antiquities are but few.  In a pretty extensive plain
field, N. E. of the village of Torryburn, there is a flat stone,
raised upon one end, of a shape nearly oblong, and measuring,
from the surface to the top, about 8 feet, and about 4 1/2 in
breadth. Round the edge of it there is a deep circle, and on
each of the sides a number of ridges, all of which wear the
appearance of art and antiquity.  At about 18 or 20 paces
from this stone, there is a number of smaller ones, which,
from their present position, seem to have formed part of a
circle.  This place is thought to have been the scene of a
battle in some former period, and there stones to mark the
graves of some of the chiefs, who had fallen in the engage-
ment.  And the supposition is rendered highly probable
by the name which it still bears, Tollzies, which is evident-
ly a corruption of the Scotch word Tulzie, which signifies a
a fight.
   In the church-yard, there is part of an epitaph, which,
from its singularity, and at the same time beautiful simplicity,
appears well worth preservation.  When the present incum-
bent entered to his benefice, it was entire upon the grave
stone; but a gentleman, whore property the burying ground
now is, perhaps from inattention, caused part of it to be
erased, in order to make room for inserting the deaths of
some of his relations.  The following is the epitaph in-
tire, as originally composed.
