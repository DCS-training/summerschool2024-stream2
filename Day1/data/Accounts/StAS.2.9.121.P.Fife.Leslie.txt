lians, 6, consisting of 15 individuals.
   The service at the Established Church is in general very well
attended. The dissenting places of worship, it is understood, are
not over-crowded; but the writer has no access to know, the exact
numbers of their congregations. The average number of communi-
cants in the Established Church is 500.
  Education.-There are altogether six schools in the parish;
the parochial school, and five unendowed schools supported by
school fees. In the parish school, Latin, Greek, and French, in
addition to the other branches of education, are taught. The pa-
rish schoolmaster's salary is L. 34; and the amount of his fees may
be L. 18; the emolument as session-clerk is L. 7 per annum. In
this parish, the parochial teacher has not the legal accommoda-
tion; but an adequate allowance is made by the heritors. A mere
English education is at the rate of 8s. per annum. For Latin and
Greek from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 5s. All persons above six years of
age in the parish can read.
  Libraries.-There is a circulating library, supported by volun-
tary subscription, and managed by a committee of the subscribers;
also a small library for the use of the children in the Sabbath
schools.
  Poors' Funds.-The average number of persons receiving paro-
cbial aid for the last seven years is 35; of these, II have received at
the rate of Is. per week, and 10s. in the year to assist them to pay
their house rent. The others have a monthly allowance accord-
ing to their families. Perhaps the clearest way to show the ex-
penses of the poor in the parish is to give the income and expen-
diture for one year, viz. 1832
