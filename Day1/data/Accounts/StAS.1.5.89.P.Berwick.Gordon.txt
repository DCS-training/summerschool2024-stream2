     of Gordon.

church and parish, formerly in the presbytery of Melrose.
Gordon is situated in the county of Berwick, in the presby-
tery of Lauder, and in the synod of Merse and Teviotdale.
The church stands at West Gordon, 33 miles distant from
Edinburgh, and 23 from Berwick.  The great road from
Edinburgh to London, by Greenlaw and Cornhill, runs
through the northern part of it, for about two miles.
Gordon is still a parish of great extent, being 7 miles long
from W. to E. but unequal in its breadth, one half being 
about 2 miles, the other half 4 miles broad; the figure is con-
sequently irregular.

   Soil, Climate, Rivers, etc.-The surface is uneven.  There
are three or four rising grounds, or hills, one of which is of
some height, and is not yet entirely cultivated, though two
sides of it are plowed; the others are all cultivated to the
top.  There are many pieces of good arable land, some of 
it clayey, but more light and sandy.  There are also great
tracts of moor, of moss, and bog.  The air is not unwhole-
some, though, from the quantity of moss and bog, damps
must arise.  Some years ago agues were prevalent.  Of
late consumptions have been more common than former-
ly.  The river Eden runs through this parish from N. to
S. and Blackadder runs on the north side for a mile or two,
both small rivers, in which there are some trouts and eels.
There are whinstones in great abundance, and some white
and red freestone.  The former are on the surface, the latter
dug out of the ground; both are used for building.

   Cattle.-Improvements in the breed of sheep and cattle
have made rapid progress, since the turnip husbandry com-
menced 15 or 16 years ago.  At that time sheep were sold,
at a year old, for six or eight shillings.  By raising for them
