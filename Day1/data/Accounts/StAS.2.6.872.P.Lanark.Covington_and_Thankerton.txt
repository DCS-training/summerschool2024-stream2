chial.  Salary, the maximum; fees about L.15.  The teacher
has the legal accomodations.
     Library.--There is one parochial library.
     Poor and Parochial Funds.--The number of poor this year is 11,
four of these have families, 4,2,4,5, in all, 15 children; the 11
have at an average 1s. 5 1/2d. per week.  It may be be said the poor
are yearly increasing.  There is a legal assesment for their sup-
port, the collections at the church not being sufficient.  The poor
do not consider it in the least degrading to seek relief.
     Inns.--There is one small inn on the road between Lanark and
Biggar.
     Fuel.--Coals are procured at Rigside and Ponfingh, the former
in the parish of Douglas, and the latter in the parish of Carini-
chael: distance ten miles; expense, 13s. 6d. per ton.

                       MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
     Great advances have been made in husbandry since the Car-
lisle and Stirling road was made through the parish, which passes
through Lanark, and opens up a fine market for produce; and if
ther proposed rail-road from the south passes through the village,
at which the branches fron Glasgow and Edinburgh are to meet,
the village will probably become a general depot, and speedily
recieve a great increase of inhabitants.

     Name.--THE writer of former Statistical Account of this
parish states the name Covington to be a corruption of Convent-
town, without giving any reason for this opinion.  But, according
to Chalmers (Caledonia, iii. 747), the old parish and barony of
Covington was called Colbanstoun in the charters of the twelfth
