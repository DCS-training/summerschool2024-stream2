               L-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--IRONGRAY, the name by which this parish is now ge-
nerally known, seems to have been added to Kirkpatrick by way
of distinction, and signifies, as has been supposed, Gray's land;
the spot where the old church stood, which was dedicated to St
Patrick, being probably so called. It lies on the night bank of
the Cluden or Cairn, a few miles to the west of Dumfries, and,
in form, is nearly triangular.
	Extent, &c.--It extends 9 miles in length, by from 1 to 4 in
breadth, and contains a rurface of 14,464 imperial acres, or 22.60
squard miles. It is bounded on the east by Terregles; on the
north, by the Cluden, which separates it from Holywood; on the
west and south-west, by Kirkpatrick-Durham and Urr; and on
the south by Lochrutton and Terregles.
	Topographical Appearances.--The appearance of the parish is
varied and singularly beautiful. The lowest or eastern extremity
is nearly level, and in a state of the highest cultivation. The
centre consists of two or more undulations of hills, being part of
a range wbich stretches across the stewartry from north to south.
Their knolls and  heights are finely wooded; their sloping accli-
vities well and somewhat tastefully enclosed, here in pasture, and
there in crop; and their outline, as seen from different parts of
