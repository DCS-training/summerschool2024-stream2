most all of it in the channel of smuggling.  This species of
business, which has always been the disgrace, and at last
proved the ruin of almost every place where it has been prac-
ticed to a great extent, enriched indeed a few merchants, who
circulated their profits in the place.  But it also contributed
to introduce, among the farmers, sailors, and even tradesmen,
a sort of low cunning, to give them such a taste for drinking
spirits, as not only hurts their health, but stints their growth,
to draw off their attention from sober, honest industry, to a
kind of gambling for gain; and, what is work of all, to
weaken in their hearts that sacred regard for truth and fair
dealing, which are the principal ingredients in every respec-
table character.  Though this shameful trade be now much
discouraged by some of the proprietors of land, who long saw
with regret its pernicious tendency, and indeed almost sup-
pressed by the vigorous exertions of the revenue officers;
yet, though the cause be in a great measure removed, the
effects, still unhappily indeed, are visible in Kirkwall.

some of them are obliged to pay entry or grassum at every
removal; and as their tack-duties are for the most part paid
in kind, they are anxious to conceal from their landlords, or
as they are sometimes still called their masters, what the
lands produces.  The feu-duties too, which on many estates
are equal to the rents paid to the lairds, are all paid in kind;
and as the crops frequently fail, this mode of payment be-
comes a very heavy burden, both on the tenants and pro-
prietors.  Very unlike the more favoured regions in the
south, where the spring comes in early with a genial warmth,
our spring continues cold until the month of June and July,
