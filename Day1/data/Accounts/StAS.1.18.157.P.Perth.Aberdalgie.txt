"to keep the castle, and therefore must wait the orders of
"my constituent;" and who, when the castle was besieged
by Edward in person, and his whole army, had the courage
to defend it for full three months; though before the com-
mencement of the siege, all the rest of the kingdom had been
forced to submit to Edward's power.  Douglas, in his peerage,
says, I know nor upon what authority, that this was the de-
puty governor's son; and Crawford in his, that he was his
grandson.  Both agree, that it was this Sir William Oliphant,
who subscribed along with several other Scottish Barons, the
famous letter to the Pope, which asserts with so much spirit,
the independence of Scotland.
   Besides Duplin castle, the family of Oliphant had a house
close by the church of Aberdalgy, the foundations of which
may still be traced.  At a place called Monday, where there is
a commanding view of all the country around, there are some
vestiges of a large building, concerning which tradition has
handed down nothing but its name, viz. Kemp or Camp castle.

   Battle.-This parish was the scene of that unfortunate bat-
tle, fought on the 12th August 1332, between Edward Bal-
liol, and the Scottish army commanded by the Earl of Mar.
The spot where the battle was fought, has not been ascer-
tained.

   Character of the Inhabitants.-As to the character of the
people, it may be said with truth, that they are sober, peace-
able, and industrious.
