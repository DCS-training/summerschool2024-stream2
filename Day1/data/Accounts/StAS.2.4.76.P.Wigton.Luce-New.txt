           I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Extent, &c.--THE parish of New Luce, is situated in a moor-
land district of Wigtonshire, extending about 10 miles in length,
from north to south; and 6 miles in breadth, from east to west. It
is bounded on the south by the parish of Old Glenluce, from
which it was taken, and erected into a separate parish in the year
1628. It is bounded on the east by the parish of Kirkowan,
from which it is separated by the Water of Tarf; on the north,
by the parishes of Colmonell and Ballantrae; and on the west
by the parish of Inch, from which it is divided by the main
water of Luce, which rises among the hills in Ballantrae, and runs
south until it falls into the sea in Glenluce Bay. The Cross-water
of Luce rises among the said bills, runs in a south-east direction until
it reaches the middle of the parish, where it turns to the west, and
runs into the main water at right angles, where the parish church
and village are situated, at the distance of five miles from the vil-
lage of Glenluce, and nine miles from the town of Stranraer.
	The salmon-fishing in the main water belongs to Sir James
Dalrymple Hay, of Park Place, Bart.; that in the Cross-water has
hitherto been reekoned free.
	Geology.--The rocks of this parish belong to the stratified series
of the transition class.
