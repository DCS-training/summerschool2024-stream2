price, and a horse, when he should ride, at the ordinary
hire.  The minister who reckons upon what he can turn out
of a glebe, reckons upon a loss, if he has in that glebe less
than from 15 to 20 acres*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Suppose the four acres of a legal glebe to be under pota-
toes, bear, hay, and oats, in rotation, the produce, in this coun-
try, may be reckoned as follows:

1 Acre of potatoes, taking 20 pecks seed,
and reckoning (above the average of
the country) 15 returns; or, after
deducting the seed, 17 1/2 bolls at 8 s.

1 Ditto bear, taking 12 pecks seed, and
reckoning 6 returns (5 1/2 being he
average of the country) or, after de-
ducting the seed, 3 3/4 bolls, at 20 s.     3   15   0
1 Ditto hay, which must go to main-
tain the horse and cow in winter, and
therefore cannot be reckoned; but
instead of it, take the produce of 2
cows, at more than its average value

1 Ditto of oats, taking 1 boll seed; and
allowing 4 returns, (3 1/2 being the a-
verage of the country,) or, after de-
ducting the feed, 3 bolls, of which 2 1/2
must go to feed the horse, and the
other 1/2 to the cows in time of calv-
ing, and therefore cannot be reckon-
ed.
