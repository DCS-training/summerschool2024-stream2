   Rivers, Fish, Climate, etc.-Eden, the principal river in
the county of Fife, abounding with excellent trout, runs
along the N. W. side of the parish about a mile and a half.
Three burns or brooks, one from the east, one from the
south, and one from the west, unite near the village of
Ceres, and form what is called Ceres burn; which, after
running a mile and a half, in a N. E. direction, through this
parish, turns north through the parish of Kemback, and
falls into the Eden a little above Dairfie bridge.  In Ceres
burn there are a good many trouts, but the number is pre-
vented from increasing, by the ochre water from the coal
mines, and by the great quantity of lint, steeped annually
in the burn itself, or in the rivulets which fall into it.
Every part of the parish, is well supplied, with springs or rivu-
lets of excellent water; and this advantage it derives from
its hilly situation.  On the banks of the Eden, and in the
valley around the village of Ceres, the air is temperature
and mild.  Snow seldom lies long.  Harvest begins com-
monly about the 20th of August.  But in the higher parts
of the parish, the air is colder,-snow lies longer,-and
harvest does not begin till about the first week of Septem-
ber.  The parish is healthy, and not distinguished from the
adjacent districts by any pariticular disease.  With regard
to longevity, the inhabitants are on the same sooting with
those in the neighbourhood.

   Agriculture and Produce.-Within these last 30 years,
much has been done in the way of inclosing; in some pla-
ces with stone dikes, in others with hedge and ditch.
Within the same period, much has also been done in the
way of planting:  And this, together with inclosing, has
added much both to the beauty and value of these estates,
where they have taken place.  Much, however, in both
respects, yet remains to be done.  The cultivation of
