claven, and ends at a small village called Invar, about a quar-
ter of a mile W. from the church.  Murthly, the residence of
the Stewarts of Grandtully, is in this district, and presents itself
to the eye of the traveller, at the distance of a mile on the right
hand, the moment he comes in sight of the Tay, upon the
great Highland road from Perth to Dunkeld.  This may be call-
ed the district of Murthly, as the barony of that name makes
the greatest part of it.
   The soil towards the E. is a kind of black loam with a small
mixture of sand.  It is for the most part light and free, but
not ungrateful to the husbandman who treats it with skill and
industry.  The surface is waving and various, but no where
too steep for the plough.  The inclosures of Murthly are spa-

heathy muir, all capable of cultivation; but a considerable part
of it is covered with valuable woods.  The western part of this
district consists of a stripe of arable land, extending three miles
below Invar, in the bottom of a deep narrow vale along the
Tay, adorned with oak woods and plantations.
   The hill of Birnam, rendered classic ground, by the magic

rude and striking magnificence, to an elevation higher than
that of the Sidla hills in Forfar-shire opposite to it.  The soil is
a mixed sand, far from being unproductive when cultivated
with judgement.
   The second district stretches from Invar along the Tay about
10 miles, till it joins Grandtully in the parish of Dull.  The
greatest part of this tract, having once been the property of
the see of Dunkeld, is called the bishopric; under which name
therefore this whole district may be comprehended.  It con-
tains a considerable number of inhabitants.
   The cultivated lands make the south side of a charming val-
ley, through which the river winds its course in a gentle majestic
