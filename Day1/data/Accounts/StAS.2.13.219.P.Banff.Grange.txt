on masters' own adventure, so that now every opportunity of
education is offered to all parts of the parish. The people esti-
mate, according to its true value, the instruction of their families.
   Poor.-The poor, supplied from the funds, receive quarterly
each about 5s. or 4s. 6d. This is a very inadequate supply; but
they receive much both in food and kindness from their more for-
tunate neighbours. The farmers are very charitable.

               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   This parish is much changed since the last Statistical Account
was written, having now very good roads and bridges, all kept in
thorough repair. There are several very large farms, beautifully and
substantially enclosed with limestone dikes, and well-kept hedge-
rows. The trees and plantations are now numerous and varied,
and there are many richly cultivated fields, and even farms that
were at that time heather and morass. On the farms of Haughs
and Mains of Grange, there is a most substantial embankment a
mile long, on the Isla, erected at the expense of the heritor. On
the farms of Cantly, Clerkseat, Little Clerkseat, and Auchinhove,
the farmers have erected smaller embankments, at their own ex-
pense, by which much fine land has been protected from the ca-
lamities of flood and storm. In the year 1829, the flood on the
Isla was terrific, and the calamity memorable.
   This parish has long been infested by cairds, tinkers, and stur-
dy-beggars; but it may be hoped that the evil will soon be remov-
ed by the county police.
   An extensive embankment is about to be raised on the farm of
Braco.
