   Minerals.-There is great deal of excellent free stone in
the parish, which supplies the country to the north.  It is
got in the higher grounds, seems to run under the hills, and
appears again on the other side.  The soil above the free
stone is commonly damp and mossy, covered with coarse
grass, and always with heath, if the stone is near the surface.
The hills are composed of whin stone; they are all covered
with fine short grass, without any heath.  It seems probable,
that these hills were once bare rocks, the surface of which has
been dissolved by the influence of the weather, into the
mould that at present covers them.  When the turf is taken
off, the rock is seen to be in a mouldering state; and when 
this rotten rock, (as it is here called), is laid upon a road, in 
a few years it is changed into a reddish earth, exactly resem-
bling that on the hills.  There is lime in the parish of a
good qaulity, especially for building; but it lies so deep in
the earth, and the road to it is so inconvenient, that little
advantage has been derived from it in this neighbourhood.-
There is also coal in the estate of Blair, belonging to John
Adam, Esq; of Maryburgh.  It has produced 180 L. a year;
but it has not been wrought for some time, on acount of its
vicinity to the proprietor's house.

   Animals.-Besides the common domestic animals, there are
hares, rabbits, weasels, otters, and foxes; which last are more
destructive to the poultry than to the sheep.  Water rats
and water mice are found by the sides of the rivers.  Bad-
gers and polecats are sometimes killed.-The birds are, par-
tridges, moorfowl, snipes, wild ducks, a few curlews, herons,
owls, hawks, crows, magpies, jackdaws, water crows which 
sing in winter, blackbirds, thrushes, linnets, larks, and seve-
ral other kind od small birds.  One family of hawks has
inhabited a particular rock for many years; they seem to be
