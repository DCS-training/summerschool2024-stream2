	tion was established, and has since been maintained between In-
	verness, Glasgow, and the west coast, generally by means of steam-
	boats, and with all parts of the United Kingdom, for the ordinary
	carrying trade by means of sailing-vessels, which import all the pro-
	ducts of the south to the Highlands, and carry away timber, wool,
	grain, and the produce of the northern fisheries.
	     For all these purposes the Canal presents important facilities,;
	and would no doubt be much more frequented than it is, were
	steam tug boats established to insure at all times a speedy passage
	through the lakes,-the delay and uncertainty at present from
	adverse winds being sometimes considerable. The communication
	between Inverness and Liverpool through this canal, and directly
	with London by the German Ocean, is now about to be completed
	by steamers of a large size; while with Aberdeen and Leith it has been
	open by steam for several years back. A company, indeed, has
	been formed, who intend, in course'of next summer (1835,) to run
	a steam ship of 240 horse power between Inverness and London,
	touching at all the ports of the Moray Frith; and a powerful ves-
	sel already plies to Liverpool. The chief effect of the canal, so
	far as regards the town of Inverness, has hitherto been the com-
	mencement and gradual formation of a direct intercourse with the
	great western marts of Glasgow and Liverpool, and through them
	with the manufacturing districts with which these cities are so close-
	ly connected.
	     Roads.-The principal roads which radiate from Inverness and
	intersect the parish in different directions, are under the manage-
	ment of the Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland roads and
	bridges,-a body appointed for opening up the communication by
	land, much about the same time that, under similar management,
	the Caledonian Canal was projected. They form portions, 1st,
	of the great south road by Fort-George to Elgin and Aberdeen;
	2d, of the Highland ro`d through Badenoch and across the sum-
	mit of the country to Perth; 3d, of the Old Military road along
	the south side of Loch Ness to Fort-Augustus and Fort-William,;
	4th, of the road along the north side of Loch Ness by Urquhart to
	Glenmoriston, Glenshiel, and Skye; 5th, of the great north road
	by Beauly to Dingwall and Tain, and 6th, the short piece of road
	to Kessock Ferry, which connects Inverness with the neighbour,
	ing parts of Ross-shire. The whole of these lines were either
	Military roads, improved and widened under the direction of the
	Commissioners, or Originally Constructed by them, with the aid of
