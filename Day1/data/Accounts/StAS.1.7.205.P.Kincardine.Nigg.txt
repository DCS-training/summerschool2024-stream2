pint of oil (10 d. or 1 s,) from the liver; and the fish being
sold to country people, or dried for use.  A stronger line,
with larger hooks, for this fishing, contains 24 scores, 480 1/4
yard distant, and costs 10 s.-The last fishing is with the
great line.  From March or April, as the weather permits,
it commences.  After catching small fish for bait, the fisher-
men go off farther into the sea, to two and several more
leagues from shore, to find the larger species.  The ling is
first in good state, then the hollobut, (here called turbot),
and afterwards the skate in May and June.  Large cod, cal-
led keilling, are also got in spring and summer.  The line
for all these is of considerable strength, and contains, at 4 1/2
fathoms distance from each other, on snoods of one fathom,
3 scores, 60 large hooks, in value 25 s.-For the small fish
they use a yaul 17 feet long, 7 L. value, dividing sometimes
for despatch into two parties, and taking in a young or old
man when they go short way from shore.  But to the dog-
fishing they use a boat 23 feet long, by 9 fully wide, with 2
small masts and fails, 15 L. in value, and have 6 men.  In
this slender vessel, in which they seek the larger fish towards
summer, they venture off, with compass, to the bank, 14 or,
15 leagues from land, and draw their lines twice or thrice
before they return.
   From the statement it appears, a fisherman needs only
2 L. 10 s. for lines; and this small outlet, sometimes less,
enables him, at the age of 19 or 20, to gain bread as well as
his father, and therefore to marry and raise a family, which
soon he generally does.
   The bait for the small fish is the limpet, gathered usually
by the children from the rocks; the sand eel, dug out of the
sand, or caught behind the meshes of a net by baskets; a
worm got in the sand, lug; some offals from the butcher-
market salted, and the muscle.  They go to Montrose, some
