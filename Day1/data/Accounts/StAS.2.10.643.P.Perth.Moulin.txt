which are to be seen among those of other animals in Blair
Castle.
  Animals.-"The quadrupeds are horses, cows, sheep, goats, *
swine, dogs, cats, wild cats, polecats, weasels, martins, foxes, bad-
gers, rabbhts, roes, deer, hares in abundance, a species of hare of a
light-blue colour in summer, and perfectly white in winter. The
fowls are, common hens, geese, ducks, pigeons, wood-pigeons, jays,
wood-cocks,t magpies, rails, plovers, herons, owls, partridges,
muir-fowls, blackcocks, crows, hawks, ravens, kites, eagles." To
this enumeration there are now to be added the otter, the hedge-
hog, the squirrel, the rat, the turkey, and the pheasant. The
snipd and ptarmigan, and many other Alpine birds, not mentioned
above, are found in our hills. Among the smaller birds we have
the blackbird, the mavis, the lark, the,linnet, and the thrush, to de-
light us with the sweet variety of their melodies; and in their sea-
son the cuckoo and other migratory birds make their appearance.
  Fishes.- There is abundance of common river trout found in the
Garry and Tummel, and in their season salmon, grilse, and sea-
trout. The salmon begin to arrive in March, grilse and sea-trout
in June. They return again from January to April.

 <FOOTNOTE> I am not aware of the dhsappearance of any animal that fomerly existed here ex-
cept the goat, and if it is now at any time sean, it is only as an occasional visitor from
higher and wilder regions.
  The woodcock is known to breed in this parish.
