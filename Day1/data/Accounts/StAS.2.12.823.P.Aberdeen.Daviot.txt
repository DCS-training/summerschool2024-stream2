   There is now in the writer's possession a silver coin, which was
dug up in some years ago, in a small kitchen garden, wherein stood
formerly the old manse.  It is larger but thinner than a shilling
of the present coinage.  On one side is Elizabeth: D: G: Ang:
Fr:et Hi: regina, around the Queen's head, and on the other,
the royal arms, surrounded bv the following inscription; . . .
Posui Defi adjutorem meu; * but there is no date upon it.
   A small pot or cooking utensil, of rather an elegant shape, was
turned up on a waste part of a field, of a farm on the property of
Mounie in 1834, and is now in the farmer's possession.  It is made
of bronze, has evidently been rubjected to the action of fire, and
may probably have been left by the troops which crossed this part
of the country in 1745-6.  Its depth is seven inches, its diameter,
where widest, eight inches, the diameter of its neck, where nar-
rowest, four inches and three-fourths, and the diameter of its
mouth six inches, all inside measure.
   In 1834, a handsome substantial mansion-house was built by
the present proprietor on the estate of Fingask, in the erection of
which the stone chiefly employed was granite.
