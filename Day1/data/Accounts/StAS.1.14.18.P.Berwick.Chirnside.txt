relative to those farms, in which large tracks of new
ground were to be opened, and manured with lime.  Ex-
perience had proved, that the foil, especially if the light,
might be stimulated, as in 2 or 3 years, to lose its fer-
tility altogether, and could not admit of repair, but by
being laid down in grass pasture, for a considerable time;
restrictions, therefore, wore to be prescribed to the tenants,
with respect to this, by special articles in their leases.
The limiting quantity of such hurtful culture, and
how long the land was to be rested, in case the lease was
to be extended to a number of years, afforded some ground
of discord.  The keeping up of the fences, either already
made by the landlord, or to be afterward reared by com-
pact with the tenants, at a mutual expense, likewife oc-
cationed hesitation of the part of the latter.  But where
these points did not impede agreements, large farms
were let in the parish at several prices, from the low-
est at 12 s. to the highest at 20 s. the acre; the inter-
mediate rates, and these not reckoned the dearest, being
about 16 s.  The south croft land rose from above 20 s. to
30 s., and that of the north to 25 s.
   Having thus traced the progress, both of the value
and improvements of the whole lands in the parish, du-
ring a course of 45 years, and shown how they kept
pace with each other, the result of the investigation pre-
sents the comparative and statistical estimate of land
property.  The farms which, in the beginning of that
period, gave, at an average, 3 s. the acre, now give 12 s.;
and those at the medium of 5 s. now afford 20 s.; whence
the increase of the real rent appears to be quadruple.
That this advancement, apparently vast, was no greater
than the produce of the lands in their cultivated state.
and the raised value of their various production could
