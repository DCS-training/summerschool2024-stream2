     Statistical Account

The quantity imported before the late prohibitory distilling
act was great, and in general of a very bad quality.
   A distillery, on a pretty extensive scale, was lately erect-
ed near Aberdeen; it was completed on the 29th Septem-
ber 1794.  It is situated near Don Bridge.  The chief in-
ducement for erecting it there was the command of water,
38 feet perpendicular upon the banks of a navigable river.
It was intended to distil annually the produce of 12,000
quarters of corn, but could do much more.  This season,
(1795), owing to obstructions from the severity of the
weather during the last winter and spring, the embargo,
and the prohibition, only 821 s quarters were breewed, pay-
ing upon importation to London L. 26,800 Sterling, with
about L. 1000 more for duty upon-malt.  The principal
part of the corn grew in Aberdeenshire; the rest was im-
ported from the adjacent districts.  The whole was the
growth of Scotland.
   It would be of great public utility if distilleries upon a
moderate scale were erected in different counties through-
out the united kingdoms, instead of being concentered in
and near London, in ten great houses.  Most of the spent
wash or burnt ale, and much of the dung, is thrown into the
river, which, besides injuring the water, is a loss to society.
More cattle and hogs would be fed, and all damaged or ill-
harvested corn, unfit for exportation, would be turned
the utmost advantage; the manure would enrich the lands
contiguous.  This distillery would well keep at the rate of
400 cattle, or 1000 hogs, yielding sufficient manure to ferti-
lize annually from 15 to 20 Scotch acres, of the most bar-
ren land; but call it at a medium 20 English acres, as the
contents of the wash-still here amounts only to 2650 gal-
lons, every 100 gallons ought to manure nearly one Eng-
lish acre; and consequently the London distilleries, whose
