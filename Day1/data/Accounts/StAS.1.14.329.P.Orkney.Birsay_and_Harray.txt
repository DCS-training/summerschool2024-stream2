     Of Birsay and Harray.

     PARISH OF HARRAY.

   Name, Soil, Air, etc.-The parish of Harray is un-
der the same ministry as Birsay, and is joined with
Birsay at N. W.; towards the W. it touches Sandwick;
W., S. W., and S. it is bounded by a large brackish
loch, commonly called the Loch of Harray; and on the
other quarters, by Stenness, a small part of Firth, and
the hills that part it from Randale.  What the origin
of the name is, I know not, nor ever read of it in an-
cient history.  It is a very irregular parish; and, be-
tween arable and uncultivated ground, may contain 21
square miles, being about 6 miles long, and 3 1/2 miles
broad.  In general, Harray is flat and rather swampy,
intersected by a great number of very dangerous burns,
which, at most seasons, rush down in perfect torrents
from the adjacent hills, and often occasion danger and
even death to unwary travellers.  The soil varies very
much; in some places tolerably fertile, and in others
very barren; the nature of it is generally very spongy;
or else very hard and channelly, with but a very small
stratum of carth.  By the nature of the earth, the air
must be moist, and often produces most severe colds,
dropsies, ferofulas, and other cutaneous distempers,
which may be owing to a watery diet, such as cabbage,
etc.  There is one large loch, which produces a great
quantity of most excellent fish of the trout kind; and a
lesser one, which supplies their mill.  The fish in this
parish are never sent to market, and are in best perfec-
tion in the summer time, especially from May till Sep-
tember.-The hills are about the same height as those
in Birsay.  The meadows are often subject to inunda-
