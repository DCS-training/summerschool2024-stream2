and is now alehouse;  and a number of the others, which
are still standing, are in similar situations.  The cathedral
is now divided into three separate places of worship, and
considerable attention is paid every year to keep it in re-
pair.
   Nigh the cathedral, was the bishop's palace or castle, the
great tower of which was built by John Cameron, former-
ly secretary of state, and afterwards conference bishop of
Glasgow in 1426.  It was augmented by Bishop Beatoun,
in the beginning of the 16th century, who built another
tower, and inclosed the whole with a high stone wall of
excellent workmanship.  His successor, Bishop Dunbar,
built a handsome gateway to the palace, fronting the
church, on which his arms engraven under the royal
arms of Scotland, and which was standing a few years ago;
but both it and all the rest of the building having gone
to ruin.  The remainder has been ordered to be taken down,
having been granted by the Crown, to erect an in-
firmary on the ground where it stood.  In order to shew
the situation it was reduced to, when this took place, two
accurate drawings of it have been taken, which are to be
framed and hung up in some of the rooms of the new
building.
   Almost all the towns of any antiquity, in Europe, owe
their origin, to the situation of a casle, a cathedral, an ab-
bacy, or a sea-port.  These naturally gathered round them
a variety of different persons, connected with these esta-
blishments, where they found protection and employment,
amidst the disorders and violence, to which the inhabitants
of the open country were exposed.  Glasgow e-
vidently derives its origin from the establishment of its
cathedral, near to which the houses of the old town were
built, and which extended gradually towards the river, as
the inhabitants turned their attention to commerce.-  About
