   Provost Robinson has long enjoyed the lease of the fish-
ings, and generally employs 80 to 100 men in the dif-
ferent departments of the trade.

   The fishing commences attending the fishing amount to a
sum at least double of the yearly rent.

   The cruives are about a mile from the sea, and the whole
extent of the river-fishing, including its windings, does not
much exceed four miles*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The preservation of salmon seems very early to have attracted the at-
tention of the Legislature.  Alexander II anno 1284, enacted at Perth,
upon Thursday, "the feast of St Margaret, that the stream shall in all parts
"may turn himself within the stream round about two that his snout nor
"tail shall not touch the bank or side of the water."  Hence, probably,
the first construction of the cruives in Scotland.

   The salmon is said to breed or cast his spawn in most rivers in the month
of August.  They deposit their eggs or spawn in a safe place, in the gra-
vel, and then leave it to their Creator's protection.  Sir Francis Bacon ob-
serves, "the age of a salmon exceeds not ten years.  His growth is very
"sudden, so that after he has got into the sea, he becomes from a samlet,
"not so big as a gudgeon, to be a salmon, in as short a time as a golfing
"becomes a goose."
