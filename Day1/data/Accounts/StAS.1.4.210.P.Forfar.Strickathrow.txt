partly clay, and partly loam, and the hills on either side
are covered with heath.  The air is generally dry, and
wholesome; though there are in several places, marshes
and waste grounds.  The parish is remarkably well wa-
tered.  A large rivulet, called the Crook, enters it on the
W.; on the N. it is bounded by a considerably larger
stream, called the West-water, which, about half a mile
from the church, joins one still larger, called the East-
water; and these soon joining the Crook, they form alto-
gether the river Northesk.  These waters are well sup-
plies with trout, and in the Northesk there is a consider-
able salmon-fishing.

   Agriculture, etc.-The productions of the parish are
principally oats and bear, (commonly called Chester), with
some barley and wheat.  Of this last very little is raised,
partly owing to the lightness of the soil, and partly to an
opinion that two crops of other grain are more profitable.
The return is various, according to the quality of the soil,
and the state of improvements, though it generally is from
6 to 10, and may be estimated, at an average, 7 after 1.
In 1784, a field, containing 7 1/2 acres, yielding upwards of
90 bolls meal; it was indeed the first crop after lime, and
that year the crop was good every where.  Flax, for which
the soil seems to be generally adapted, is raised to a con-
siderable extent, and is usually the second crop after ley.
Eight pecks of feed are sown on each acre, and the return
is 32 stones dressed lint, but this depends on the state of the
ground.  An acre of lint, sold on the foot, brings from
L.10 to L.14.  The flax, which the farmer raises and
spins in his own family, brings him about L. 1, 2 s. the
stone; when he gives it out to be spun, he pays at the
rate of 1 s. 1 d the spindle.  A farmer of this parish has
attempted to raise white clover seed, and for 2 years past
