not now, as formerly, made up for the market, they are still manu-
factured in considerable quantity for home use. Their style and
manner of dress, on the whole, is decent, neat, and substantial.
The ordinary food of the peasantry is oatmeal porridge and milk,
when milk can be got, for breakfast; for dinner, potatoes and salt-
herrings, or other kinds of fish,--and with the better economists,
pork or bacon differently prepared; and potatoes and milk or her-
rings to supper. The bread is oatcakes or scones, composed of
potatoes and oatmeal, or more rarely, of potatoes and wheaten or
barley-flour. The difficulty of procuring milk where the dairy
system prevails, has perhaps been thd principal cause of the
too frequent use of tea and its accompaniment loaf bread,--
considerable quantities of both being consumed even by the poor-
est; and it is to be feared too many forego the more substantial fare
which the pig they feed would furnish, to indulge in this favourite
repast.
	The people enjoy in a considerable degree the comforts and ad-
vantages of society, and seem contented with their situation and
circumstances. Their secluded situation does not present many
opportunities of cultivating their intellectual powers. Their attain-
ments in religious knowledge are respectable, and their general
demeanour is peaceable and orderly. Poaching in game is occa-
sionally followed by a few individuals. Smuggling, which at one
time was almost the sole occupation of many of the principal in-
habitants, is now entirely abandoned.
