fending from rain, and preserving the wool, it is usual, about
the beginning of November, to lay the tups and lambs, and
a few of the weakest ewes, with tar and butter.  For the
the same purpose, many now bathe the rest of their sheep
with a strong infusion of tobacco, broom tops, etc.

   Farms Rents, etc.-The size of the farms is various.  In
the lower part of the parish, where the principal dependence
is upon gram and black cattle, besides the lands possessed im-
mediately by the proprietors, there are 10 farms containing
from 50 to 164 acres, and paying from 20 L. to 80 1 Ster-

acres, mostly of hill pasture, and paying from 11 L. to 80 L. of
yearly rent.  The average rent of a sheep's pasture in the pa-

have been let of late, it is considerably higher.  Upon two
of these sheep farms, the smaller tenants have a common
right of pasture to 6 or 7 horses; and there is one hills, con-
sisting of 784 acres, which is laid mostly under sheep, and
which is entirely in the hands of 11 of the smaller tenants,
each of whom is entitled to keep there a certain proportion
of cattle.  Besides the said grain and sheep farms, there are
several cottages, to which a garden, and sometimes an acre,
or half an acre of land is annexed.  The tenants of the
smaller farms, as well as the cottagers, depend often more
upon days labour, or some other employment, than upon the
produce of any land they possess.

   Wages, Provisions, Fuel, etc.-The common wages of men
