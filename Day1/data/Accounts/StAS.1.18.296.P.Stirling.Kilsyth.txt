scarcely a stone was to be found?  If it was merely to
commemorate the atchievements of the dead, or as a
monument to his praise; how comes it that there never
has been found any inscription, or even hieroglyphic, to
point out the names, designation, character, or country of
the deceased?  If it was merely to defend the body from the
ravenous wolves, and wild beasts, one tenth, in many cases,
one hundredth part of the pile might have sufficed.  And
besides, the body seems to have been burned; so that there
was no danger from that quarter.  It seems, however, certain,
that these were the works not of any individual, or family;
but of a whole clan, or tribe, or nation.  Perhaps they were
the work of ages.  All nations pay veneration to the ashes
of the dead; and I believe there are none so rude and uncivi-
lized, as to have no monuments.  In early ages, the natives
of this island, might fall upon this method of distinguishing
the graves of great heroes, and eminent saints.  As a tribute
of esteem, every traveller as he passed, would naturally add
his stone to the heap; so that although small at first, it would
increase from year to year, in proportion to the veneration
that was paid to the deceased.  In evidence of this, it is said,
that a similar custom still prevails in the highlands of Scot-
land; and almost every cairn or tumulus, has its respective
name, as Angus-cairn etc.
   One of the cairns in this parish, likewise records the name
of some saint or hero.  It is near a place called Kelvin-head.
Now, as kel, or cuil, or cella signifies a cell, or burying
ground; so vean, or bean, which in Gallic are the same, is
the name of a Culdee saint; or, according to some, of Fin-
gal, the Caledonian hero.  At all events, this tumulus seems
to have been the burying place of Vean.  And hence the ori-
gin of the names in the neighbourhood of it, as Bean-ton, or,
as it is now contracted, Banton; Beanemyre; Tom-vean,
