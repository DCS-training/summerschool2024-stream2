rials, and a good workman may execute 200 yards of it in
a day.  It can be done no where to purpose but upon grass
lands, where the sod has acquired a considerable degree of
cohesion by the roots of the grass.  The same kind of spades
which dug the last drain will dig this.  The first spade takes
out the sod to any length alongst the drain the operator
thinks convenient; that is laid to one side, and the second
spade takes out the remainder of the earth, which is laid to
the other side; he then pairs with a knife the sides of the
sod, so as when replaced, in an inverted position, and pres-
sed down with the foot, the surface may reach till within 3 or
4 inches of the bottom of the drain; the earth is then filled
in, and sown with grass-seeds.  It must be attended to, that the
sods ought not to be replaced in the drain too close together,
to prevent the water from the sides and the top from getting
down.
   The sods are here in the situation of the key-stones of an
arch; the more perpendicular pressure they receive they be-
come the firmer.  In short, taking all circumstances toge-
ther, this is the best species of drain we have ever seen or
heard of.  It was lately imported by Sir William Cunyng-
hame himself from Richmond Park, Surry, to Livingstone,
and we do not know that it has been executed any where
else in Scotland.
   A fourth species of drain, or rather aqueduct, and even
still more simple than the last, has been tried here with suc-
cess.  A ditch was made at the necessary depth, narrow at
the bottom, in which was laid a smooth tree or cylindrical
piece of wood, about 20 feet long, 6 inches diameter at the
one end, and 5 at the other, having a ring in the thickest
end, to which a rope was fastened; after strewing a little
sand upon the surface of the tree, the clayey or tilley con-
tents of the ditch were first thrown in, and then the re-
mainder, and trod firmly down; then, by means of the
rope, the tree was drawn out till within a foot or two of
