Roman rampart; by others, the vestiges of a fortification by
the Saxons, or the ancient Britons. A little above the town,
towards the west, is an earthen mound, of a conical figure, call-
ed the Mote.  Some suppose this a tumulus; others, a place
raised for the principal inhabitants of the town to meet, for
the distribution of justice.  This last, its name and tradition
confirm.  At an early period, this was common throughout
Scotland.  When the chiefs and the leading people in a dis-
trict met, to promulgate laws for the government of their de-
pendants, it was generally on a hill of some eminence; and
many places still retain the appellation, as North Berwick
Law, in East Lothian; Largo Law, in Fifeshire; and Ruber's
Law, in this neighbourhood. 

   Character of the People.-Athough individuals in this pa-
rish, as in other places of the same extent, are given to the
vices usual in there times, yet the inhabitants, in general, are
honest, sober, and industrious.  Their industry is not the vio-
lent exertion of a moment; but steady, calm, and persevering:
And were it not for many disadvantages and difficulties, they
have to encounter, the spirit of the inhabitants of Hawick
would raise it to the first station of manufacture, in the south
of Scotland.

"against any enemy, that lay to the S. and E. of it."  Its remains in the parish of
Cavers, and on the Gallow, are still conspicuous; but little of it is observable
in the parish.
