     of Carluke.

   Farms, Rent, etc.-The farms here, are not in general
large.  The greatest corn farms are rented at from 30 L. to
130 L. Sterling.  Unless it be in the best holm ground, or
near the village of Carluke (where the people pay higher for
conveniency), the first kind of croft land pays from 1 L. to 1 L. 10 s.
Sterling per acre.  The second sort, from 10 s. to 15 s.  The
best out-field land (unless in more sheltered situations), from 3 s.
to 6 s.; and the worst, from 2 s. to 3 s.  The traveller, in
passing through this parish, can form but an imperfect idea, of
the quality of the ground in general, as the public roads hap-
pen to be carried through the most barren and uncultivated
fields; the crofts of the villages of Carluke and Killcaigow
excepted.  Here the lands are rich and loamy, and the crop
generally plentiful and luxuriant On an average, the land
may sell here, at from 25 to 30 years purchase.  In the roll
of conversion for the statute labour, the number of plough-
gates, as they are here called, amount to about 68, besides
cottagers, etc.  As to services, there are none worth mention-
ing required of the tenants.

   Orchards.-Fruit abounds more in this parish, than any
other upon the Clyde, or perhaps even in Scotland*.  The
orchards in this district, extend about 5 miles, and are the
property of many different proprietors.  They comprehend,
