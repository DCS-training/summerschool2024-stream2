ture of the rock and stone with which the surface a-
bounds.  Part of it is black, and part red hazel loam.
The black is by far the most fertile, and generally co-
vers either slate or lime-stone.  The red loam is com-
monly mixed with whinstone, and though in good heart,
is easily exhausted.  There is a third kind of soil which
forms the greatest part of the arable of these islands:
this, though not so solid as the black loam, nor so po-
rous as the red, is not much inferior in fertility to ei-
ther.  This soil appears to be a mixture of pulverized
slate and lime-stone, which, in quality and colour, re-
sembles dark clay, that hardens or relaxes in the same
manner,with a few days drought or rain.  It produces
good crops of oats and barley; but not so well adapted
for potatoes, unless in drill, that the ground may be
kept loose and open by frequent ploughing.

   Produce.-Oats, barley, potatoes, and a litte flax, are
the only crops raised in those parishes.  But, from ex-
periments lately made by Captain Campbell of Lochend,
steward to the Earl of Breadalbane in this country, it
appears that turnip would prove a beneficial crop; and
we have reason to believe, if the ground were properly
enclosed, that peace and beans, if not wheat, might be
raised to advantage.  Clover and rye-grass thrive re-
markably well.  Red and white clover are natives of
these islands, and turn very rich and luxuriant in con-
sequence of lime or shell land.  Green crops are more
adapted to this climate than white, because of the heavy
falls of rain in July and August.  Oats and barley, if
the ground be properly manured, are then very luxu-
riant and promising; but as they lodge early, they ne-
ver prove so fertile as in other places where rain is less
