   Mountains and Minerals-The greater part of the
two parishes is mountainous.  Some of the mountains 
probably the highest in Scotland:  Of this description
are the mountains of Loch-na-garaidh, on the S. side of
the parish; Binn-na-baird on the N.; and Binn-na-
muick-duidh on the W., etc.  Upon these mountains,
and others connected with them, there is snow to be
found all the year round; and their appearance is ex-
tremely romantic, and truly alpine.  On them are found
pellucid stones, of the nature of precious stones, e-
qually transparent, beautiful in their colour; and some
of them, particularly the emerald, as hard as any orien-
tal gem of the same kind.  The most common are, the
brown, of different shades, and next the topaz.  There
are also beautiful amethysts and emeralds, though these
are rare to be met with, particularly the latter; and
what is remarkable, amethysts only are to be found on
Loch-na-garaidh; emeralds, topazes, and the brown on
Binn-na-baird; topazes and the brown kinds only on
Binn-na-muick-duidt, and the other mountains in these
parishes.  The first of these stones that attracted notice,
and were cut by a lapidary, were found on Cairn-gorm,
in Strathspey, but connected with the above ridge of
mountains, which gave rise, though very improperly, to
the general name of Cairn-gorm stones.  Both the pa-
rishes abound with granite of different kind, and vari-
ous shades, which is used for building.  It is very hard
in its nature, and when polished, looks as well as marble.
There is limestone in great profusion.  On Mr. Far-
quharson of Invercauld's property, in the parish of Brae-
mar, is a little quarry, from which are brought almost
all the slates made use of in this country.
