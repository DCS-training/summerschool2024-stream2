rated into a mere matter of form and ceremony.  The same
subjects of disputation, the same arguments of attack and de-
fence, were preserved and handed down among the students;
the public disputations were not attended:-so that degrees
became not the rewards of abilities and diligence, but merely
the marks of standing, or residence at the University.  These
circumstances gave occasion for a material change, in the
rules for conferring degrees, in the University of Glasgow,
The composing and defending a thesis have now become op-
tional, on the part of the candidate.  The same standing is
still required; and the candidates for degrees in arts are
obliged to undergo a minute examination, in the Greek and
Roman classics, in the different branches of philosophy which
compose the curriculum, and by each of the professors in their
respective branches: an examination which, in the manner
it is conducted, gives the best opportunity of judging of the
proficiency and literature of the candidates.

   Degrees in Theology and Law.-Degrees in theology, hav-
ing no privileges in the church attached to them, under the
Presbyterian form of government, are, without any regard
to standing in the University, conferred on clergymen respec-
table for their abilities and literature.-Degrees in law are ei-
ther bestowed upon eminent men, as marks of respect; or
upon students of a certain standing, after a regular examina-
tion of the candidate.-The University of Glasgow admits
students who have passed a part of their academical course in
other universities, ad eundem, as it is commonly called: that
is, whatever part of their academical course is finished at
any other university, upon proper certificates, is admitted, as
a part of their standing, in the University of Glasgow; so
that, without again beginning their course, they can pass
forward to degrees, and be enrolled students of theology.
