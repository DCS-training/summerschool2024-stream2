There are 340 souls in the parish.  The people in general
are quiet, peaceable, and well disposed.  In the parish, are
2 Antiburghers, and 1 Episcopalian.  Since the year 1770,
the wages of men-servants, maid-servants, and day labour-
ers are neraly doubled, owing to the flourishing state of ma-
nufactures and improvements in agriculture, in this neigh-
bourhood.  There is a remarkable alteration to the better,
in the dress of the parishioners, since the year 1780.

   Antiquities.-On the west side of Clatto-moor, are the
traces of a camp.  It is genrally believed to have been
occupied by a part of Agricola's  army, and afterward by
Alpin, Wallace, and Monk.  Tradition reports, that " Wal-
"lace pitch'd his camp on Clatto-hill, and ground his corn
" at Philaw's mill,"which is about half a mile from the 
place where the traces of the camp are seen.  To the east-
ward of Strathmartin house, there is a hill, called the Gal-
low-hill, on which the Lairds of Strathmartin, in the days
of feudal tyranny, exercised their power in hanging for
petty offences.  In the north end of the parish is a large
stone, called Martin's stone, of which Gordon takes notice
in his Itinerary, (as belonging to the parish of Tealing.)
