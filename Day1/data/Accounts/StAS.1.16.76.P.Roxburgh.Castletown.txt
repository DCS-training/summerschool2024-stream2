or chubb, salmon, grilse, etc.  The salmon were very plen-
tiful in former years, but since the bay or mound was built
at Netherby, few get up at any time, and none but in the
time of a great flood.  The wild quadrupeds are foxes,
hares, wild, cats, pole cats, weazels, the white weazel, often
seen in winter, hedge hogs and Norway rats.  Tradition
affirms, that the earth of Liddisdale has a peculiar quality
of banishing the common rat from Teviotdale.  It is cer-

that country loaded their horses with it, and carried it away
for that purpose.  But it is affirmed, with more probabi-

wild ducks, snipes, wood-pigeons, buzzards, stannels, owls,
crows, ravens, herons, jackdaws, magpies, thrushes, black-
birds, starlings, linnets, and gold-finches, frequent the woods.
The bittern was formerly numerous, but is now seldom to
be seen.  The birds of passage, that visit us in the spring,
or beginning of summer, are, the Kings-fisher, water crow,
white and yellow seed birds, the black and sand martins,
the swallow, cuckoo, rail, curlew, green plover, sand lark,
stone chatterers, with different species of gulls and Shiel-
drakes.  Teal and widgeons are seen in spring when the
waters are swelled with rain.  The birds that visit us in
autumn are, the fieldfare and the wood-cock.  Eagles, or
earns, are frequently seen, but have no place of residence
here*.

*A well authenticated instance of the amazing strength of this bird
curred a few years ago upon the farm of Roughlee in this parish.  One morn-
ing, when the shepherd was going round his flock, he saw an eagle coming
over the Hermitage-hill immediately above him, with something bulky in his
