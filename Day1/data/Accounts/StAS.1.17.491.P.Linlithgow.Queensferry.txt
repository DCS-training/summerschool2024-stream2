in the part of the Frith without the Bay of Inverkeithing.
During that season a plentiful supply of good herrings was
sent to the coast towns, and to many inland places at a con-
siderable distance.  Next season the herrings were still more
plentiful, and the markets mare plentifully supplied.  Little
was done in curing for foreign markets.  The merchants,
who were inclined to engage in the trade, regretted that they
were not provided with the necessary articles of barrels and
salt.  The last was a season of an extensive and profitable
fishery.  From the middle of October to the 1st of March
last, from this place, you could count from 80 to 100 boats
almost every day busily and successfully employed.  Herrings
were found in great abundance from Burnsland to above
Borrowstounness.  Fishermen resorted to this from all quar-
ters.  A single boat often came m with 30 or 40 barrels,
which were sold for 8 L. or 10 L.  A great number of herring
busses came from Glasgow, by the great canal, and had a
most successful fishery.  Vast quantities were cured and sent
to the foreign markets.  About 6000 barrels were cured at
this port.  The inland part of the country was plentifully
supplied, at the distance of 30 or 40 miles, by land carriage.
The retail price here notwithstanding, at an average, was not
more than 6 d. a hundred.
   It is a pretty general opinion, that the herring shoals have
formerly frequented this part of the Frith, and might often
have been found in the places where the fishery has been
lately so successful.  If so, it is a subject of much regret,
that the opportunities of such a profitable fishery have been
lost; and the public are taught not to neglect to explore the
fees which surround our island, as almost every part of them
is found to contain stores not only sufficient to diffuse plenty
among the inhabitants, but also amply to reward and enrich
