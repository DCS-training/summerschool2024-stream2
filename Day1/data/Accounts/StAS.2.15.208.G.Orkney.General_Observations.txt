of temperature in these months, by sacrificing as mainy'in winter,
our agriculturists would greatly gain by the exchange. The above-
mentioned tables also show, that the mean height of the barome-
ter for twelve years, at the manses of Stromness and Sandwick,
was 29.640.
    There are no aqueous meteors peculiar to Orkney; but I may
mention a kind of cloud which I have observed four times, cover-
ing a considerabel part of the sky, hanging down like a dark dra-
pery, and each time followed, within twelve hours, by a storm.
Water spouts are -not common.
    The west and southwest winds are thought to be the strongest
and most prevalent ; but, for about two years, the southeast has
prevailed very much, as may be seen from the following table, show-
ing the number ofdays that the wind blew from the different quar-
ters each montbil during the year 1840.

     Hydrography.-This country is bounded, as we have men-
tioned, by the Pentland Firth and the Atlantic and German oceans:
it is also intersected b' tbeir'waters, which form firtbs or sounds,
through which the stream-tide runs at the rate of nine miles an
hour. The. tides are irregular and very perplexing and dangerous
to strangers ; but they facilitate -the intercourse between the dif-
ferent islands, carrying those who know how to take advantage of
them, with railway speed; so that even with a contrary wind, a to-
lerable passage may be made, when the tide is favourable.
     In most places, there are springs of good water; and cbalybe-
ones are not uncommon, flowing frnm the granite, clay flag, or
san dotoue. There are numerous lochs. That of Stenness is by far
the most extensive, being about fourteen miles in circumference.
    Geology and Mineralogy There is a district, of gra-
