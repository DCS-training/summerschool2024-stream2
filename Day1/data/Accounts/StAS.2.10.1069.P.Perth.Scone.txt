	den seeds in the Island of Juan Fernandez, and arrived at Fort
	Vancouver on the Columbia, on the 7th of April 1825.  The
	vast collections of seeds which he transmitted home from this lo-
	cality, amply proved his talents and assiduity.  He traversed the
	country across the Rocky Mountains to Hudson's Bay in 1827,
	and returned to England in the autumn of that year.  Having
	been then introduced, through Mr Sabine, to the Literary and
	Scientific Society in London, he was elected, free of expense, a
	member of the Linnaean, Geological, and Zoological Societies,
	and contributed some valuable papers.  After remaining two years
	in London, he again sailed for Columbia in the autumn of 1829.
	Here he continued his favourite pursuit.  Afterwards he visited
	the Sandwich Islands; and when his return was expected, intel-
	ligence was received of his death in very shocking circumstances.
	He had fallen into a pit made by the natives of the Sandwich
	Islands, for the purpose of catching wild bulls, and a bull being,
	in the pit at the time, this celebrated botanist was killed in the
	most horrible manner.  This event took place on July 12, 1834,
  in the thirty-sixth year of his age. *
	   The Chief Land-owners.-The land-owners of the parish are
	as follows: The Right Honourable the Earl of Mansfield;  An-

	Mansfield and Mr Murray.
	  Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers are very defective.
	The earliest entry is dated 17th February 1622, and goes on to
	7th November 1647.  There is no register of any kind for the
	next twenty-seven years.  From 1673 to 1688, there are some
	memoranda of births, &c.; but from 1688 to 1716, nothng
	whatever.  From 1716 to 1740, there is a book containing some
	brief notices, and again, after a gap from 1740 to 1762, there are
	registers from 1762 to 1772.  Minutes of session seem to have
	been kept from 1773 to 1787.  Subsequently to that date they
