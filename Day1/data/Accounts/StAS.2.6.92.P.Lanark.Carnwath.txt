92                          LANARKSHIRE.

The day is indeed regarded as a holiday by the people for many miles
round, and the scene has been made still more attractive by ther
present proprietor, Sir N. Macdonald Lockhart, Bart. who, in addi-
tion to the red hose, gives prizes for leaping, throwing the hammer,
putting the stone, playing quoits, &c.  The day is finished with a
steeple chase on foot.  Other two of the fairs, one in February, and
the other in October, are hiring fairs as they are called,--than
which, a worse system for obtaining servants never was introduced
into a country.  The evil, however, will, I believe, soon cure itself,
for as masters have already begun to feel the consequences of hir-
ing servants, without knowing any thing of their character, so few
servants of character will go to a fair for the purpose of being hired.
   Alehouses, &c.--The number of alehouses or rather whisky-
houses is by far too great; and, of course, they have the most de-
teriorating effect on the morals of the people.  This is an evil,
however, which it must be difficult to remedy, so long as the trus-
tees on roads have the power of granting licenses; because each
is anxious to secure to his own particular toll-bouse that by which
the rent is augmented.  Hence there are six tolls in the parish,
and to the keeper of each a license is granted,--and that in some
instances within a very short distance of a licensed inn.
   Fuel.--Our fuel, though peats are in abundance, consists chiefly
of coal, which we have at a very reasonable rate; a cart load of 12
cwt. costing about 2s. 6d.  Reasonable as this rate is, however,
many of the people still lay in a store of peats, which every house-
holder has a right to cast in some one of the mosses which are so
abundant in the parish.
