heighten the scenery.

   The foil of the vallies is a rich loam; the rest is almost
all of a strong marly clay, some of it of a peculiar good qua-
lity, lying in a natural state in thin horizontal layers, which
easily separate in working.  It appears naturally sterile, but,
by the effects of cultivation, produces good crops; and there 
is perhaps no part of the neighbouring country capable of
higher improvement.  Even the bottom, though mostly of
that kind of blue till which is prevalent in this clay country,
seems to be more favourable, particularly for the growth of 
wood, than most of the neighbourhood; which perhaps may
be owing to its being divided also into thin laminae, through
the sissures of which the superfluous moisture filters off.

   Springs and Rivulets.-From the evenness of the surface,
and density of the soil, springs of water are not numerous,
and this, no doubt, has made those that appear more valued,
the most considerable being dignified with the names of par-
ticular saints, such as, the Well of our Lady, St. Patrick's
Well, St. Catharine's Well, etc.  For the same reasons there 
are few brooks, and those but small ones.  The most consi-
derable is that formed by the conjunction of St. Catharine's
spring, with another little rill, which runs through the in-
closures around Dalziel house.  In one part of its course, it
has obtained a deep bed, with pretty bold banks, and falls,
in a few fine cascades, over the rocks which lie in its bot-

   Antiquities.-On the north side of this brook, upon the
most picturesque part of the banks, stands the mansion house
of Dalziel, attached to the old tower or chatteau of the ma-
