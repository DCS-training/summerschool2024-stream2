     of Livingstone.

ving may be reckoned worth L.150 Sterling a-year, which,
considering the extent of the parish, the small number of its
inhabitants, and their moderate principles, it is certainly
an eligible cure.
   The character of the present incumbent has no doubt had
its influence in forming that of the people; he is a man
equally remarkable for his worth and for his misfortunes; af-
ter having lost his wife, he has also been deprived of 5 out of
6 children, who had either arrived at, or near, the age of
majority; and he has borne these afflictions with that decent
magnanimity, which nothing but the true spirit of christi-
anity can inspire.

   School.-The schoolmaster's salary, independent of his
house, school, and other perquisites, is betwixt L.9 or L.10
Sterling; 15 merks of which arises from an old mortifica-
tion; in the remainder the heritors have voluntarily assessed
themselves; and for one half of which, by act of Parliament,
they are entitled to relief against their tenants; but this re-
lief has wisely and humanely never been demanded.  The 
situation of the place is well adapted for a public school;
and it is to be regretted, that one half of the learning pos-
sessed by the present schoolmaster is rather more than he
has occasion for.  The number of children who attend this
school is from 20 to 30; and from 30 to 40 are taught in
another private school kept in the village of Blackburn.

   Poor.-The poor are supported from the collections at
the church-doors, and the fees upon marriages, baptisms,
and burials, and the interests of an excrescent capital, which,
in better times, had arisen from these, and amounted to
about L.10 a-year, which at present is divided amongst five
persons.
