whom the churches were dedicated.  Couill-chuitin (con-
tracted for Couill-chutigin), the Gaelic name of Culli-
cudden, signifies, the Nook, or Creek of Cuddles; a
small delicate species of fish, well known on all the
coasts of Scotland, which, during summer and beginning
of harvest, are caught in great numbers along the shore
of Cullicudden, particularly in a small creek a little
above the old kirk.  This parish lies on the S. side of
the Frith of Cromarty, and in that part of the sheriff-
dom of Ross and Cromarty distinguished by the names
of an oilein-dubb (or black isle), and aird-mheadbonach,
(i.e. high in the middle or high midland); both of
which give a very just description of its situation and
appearance, as it is of a peninsula form, nearly fur-
rounded by the Friths of Cromarty and Fort-George,
rising gently from the shore of both, to a considerable
height in the middle from E. to W.; and 4-fifths of it
being as yet uncultivated, and producing nothing but
short dwarfish heath, give a black and dreary appear-
ance to the whole, notwithstanding the finely situated
and highly improved gentlemens feats with which it
abounds.  This parish is nearly 8 miles in length from
E. to W., and 3 miles in breadth from N. to S.; bound-
ed on the N. by the Frith of Cromarty, and on the S.
by the ridge of the Mull-bui, or that extensive track of
common which stretches along the summit of the Black
Isle, from the Mains of Cromarty almost to the county-
road that leads from the Ferry of Scuddal to the Ferry
of Bewley; being almost 16 miles in length from E. to
W., and 2 in breadth from N. to S. As a great part
of this very large, and almost useless common, requires
nothing but the plough to bring it into culture, and
as the whole of it is peculiarly adapted for growing
