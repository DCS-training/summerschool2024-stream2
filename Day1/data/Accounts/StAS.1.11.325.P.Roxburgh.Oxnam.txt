<FOOTNOTE>

following manner: It was supposed, that 4 firlots of oats were sown on each
English acre: The wheat and pease were proportioned as 6 of oats to 4; and
the barley as 10 of oats to 7: 8 1/2 firlots of potatoes plant an acre; and 19 lip-
ies of lintseed may be sown on the same quantity of ground.

** To prevent confusion in the table, the highest prices of wool are here
stated. White wool sometimes sold at 20 s., in 1792, and laid wool
so low as 16 s.-Wool, is supposed to drop considerably this clip, 1793.
