may be owing, in some measure, to the frequent cropping of the
land.

the parish :--

<TABLE>
           900 acres grain crop, 4 1/2 qrs. per acre, at L.1, 5s.  L.4860 0 0

                                 V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
       	Means of Communication.--A commutation road, running al-
most alone, the banks of the Gad, leads by Premnay to the turn-
pike to Inverury and Aberdeen, and another, in the direction of
Kennethmont, leads from the church to the turnpike to Huntly.
From Inverury and Huntly the church is nearly equidistant, and
the farm produce of the parish is almost wholly carried to either
of these towns; but the greater part to Inverury.
       	Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church is situated on the south
bank of the Gady, at nearly the eastern extremity of the parish,
and was built in 1815 to accommodate nearly 300. The manse
was built in 1794. The teinds are exhausted, and an allowance
from the Exchequer is required to augment the stipend to L. 150.
There is also a Dissenting chapel belonging to the Independents,
on the north-west extremity of the parish, built in 1818.
       	Education.--The parish school is situated within a few yards of
the church.  Instruction is given in English, writing, arithmetic,
book-keeping, and Latin.  Salary, L.25, 13s. 4d.  Fees in 1834
about L.13  In lieu of a garden, an allowance is given of L.2,
2s. 9d. There is a mortification of L. 1, 13s. 4d. per annum as
fees for the children of poor widows.
       	Poor.--At present there are only four upon the poor's roll.  One
of these, however, has a family of four children, wholly dependent
on the sessional allowance and the clarity of the neighbourhood.

                          MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
       	Since the date of last Report, a good deal of meadow and, bar-
ren land has been improved. Much has been done in draining,
and a good deal remains to be done. Furrow-draining on Smith
of Deanston's plan would do much good in several localities; but
the expense is too great for the farmer. As the improvement
would be permanent, the outlay by the proprietor would be amply
repaid.  The rental of the parish is about thrice what it was at
the date of last Report, and the value of stock is increased in about
