carry home to the heritor's house, and build, a leet of peats,
in the principal estate in this district.-  This costs him a week's
labour of his carts, and about 10 s for digging and building
them.  Peats are not fold publicly, but are frequently stolen,
and sometimes sold privately, to those who have no moss.
All the mosses are under bad management, and must soon be
exhausted.

   Manure.-  The dung of animals, here called muck, and
peat-ashes, are the principal manures.  Within these twelve
years, lime has been driven, in considerable quantities, from
Aberden, a distance of 14 English miles.  Some slacked lime
has also been driven, from some lime kilns, in the parishes of
Udny, New Machar, and Old Machar.  It is a very expen-
sive manure.  At the average expense of lime and car-
riage, every boll of shell-lime, (Aberden measure, holding
130 Scotch pints,) costs 5 s; and an acre of ground will re-
quire 16 bolls,- or L. 4, for lime, -and the carriage from
Aberden.  Of late years, the price of lime has fallen consi-
derably at Aberden; but it is still very dear.

   Rent and Size of Farms.-  The largest farms contains about
250 acres, including pasture grounds, and rent from L. 60,
to L. 66 a year.  There are called two ploughs.  One plough,
near the river, rents about L. 35; and, in the east division,
from L. 20 to L.25.  In small parcels, good land is rented at
20s per acre.  The farmers are generally charged 12s an acre,
for their infield land:  And their outfields and sauchs are ra-
ted at from 3s to 10s.  The first, (that which is let at 2s,) is
really the dearest, in the way they manage it, viz. plowing
without manure, and taking four or five crops of oats).  In
general, good grounds are valued very cheaply by the heritors,
