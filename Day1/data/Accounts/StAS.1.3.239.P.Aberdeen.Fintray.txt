be present at public worship, always sent a sum of money e-
very Sunday for the poor, not only from himself, but col-
lected from all the company, who resided at his house, and
did not attend.  This was a considerable source of support to
the poor; and affords an excellent example, in those parts
of the north of Scotland, where the heritors and inhabitants
are not assessed by law, as is usual in the southern districts.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are nearly 300 acres
planted with Scots fir, in general interspersed with oak, ash,
elm, plane, beech, birch, larix, spruce, silver fir, and other
forest trees.-The lands now, are commonly ploughed with
weak horse ploughs.  Formerly strong oxen ploughs were
used.  Since the introduction of horse ploughs, the number
of cattle has diminished, at least one half.  That of sheep in a
still greater proportion.-One person, aged 96, died lately,
and there are several now alive above 90 years old.  The peo-
ple are in general industrious; but te knitting of stockings,
which is here carried on to great extent, is too sedentary an
employment, and is often hurtful to the constitution.  The
farmers, in general, are but in middling circumstances:  Their
condition would be much meliorated, by giving them long
leases.  The largest farm here, consists of about 300 acres of
arable land.  The parish, in general, is uninclosed, except
what the proprietors have in their own hands.  The roads
are now in pretty good repair; and bridges are laid over all
the burns, or small rivulets in the parish.
