   Roads and Bridges.-There are excellent roads in the pa-
rish, and abundance of the best materials for making and
keeping them in repair.  The great military road from Car-
lisle to Portpatrick, which was finished in this parish in 1776,
runs through it from S. E. to N. W. by the church and
manse.  A new turnpike road is nearly finished, running in
the same direction, and nearly parallel, along the rising
ground of the eastern quarter of the parish; and, between
these two, a road leading from the church to Torthorwald,
made lately by the road-money, which is now paid instead of
the statute labour.  There are bridges over every rivulet both
on the public and private roads.

   Church and School.-It is not known when the church was
built.  It has been often repaired, and cost the heritors about
90 L.  Sterling within these 3 years.  It still requires something
more to be done to make it even tolerably comfortable.  It
stands nearly in the center of the parish, on a fine eminence,
and is seen from every farm, 2 or 3 only excepted; but suf-
fers much from its exposure to the S.  W. winds.  The Duke
of Queensberry is patron.  It is uncertain when the old part
of the manse was built, part of it being very ancient; but
an addition was made to it about 50 years ago.  It was
repaired about 9 years since.  The stipend is 86 L. 12 s. in-
cluding communion element money; and the glebe consists

There are several burrows, or, as they are called here, cairns,
in which human bones have lately been found, and urns con-
taining small pieces of bones.  One of these, situated about a
mile and a quarter east from the church, bears the name of the
Stryal, or, as some say, the Tryal cairn.  Its circumference is 288
feet; and is high to what is still called Deadmangill.  At one of
these places, tradition says, malefactors were tried, and executed
at the other.  Urns have also been found in some places where
there was no appearance of tumuli.
