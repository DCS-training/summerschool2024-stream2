piece, as parties can agree.  There may be about 4 or 5 small
farms let in this way, the yearly rent arising from each of
which will not amount to 20 L. Sterling.  Several farms are
inclosed, but a greater number still lie open.  In this respect
there is great room for improvement here.  The farmers, in-
deed, are not insensible to the advantages of inclosing, but
it is scarcely to be expected that they will lay out the neces-
sary expence to make inclosures, on so short a lease as 19
years.  Unless proprietors hold out some inducement, either
by increasing the length of their leases, or advancing the ne-
cessary sums at a moderate interest, it is to be feared that
many of the fields will continue long in their present naked
and exposed state.  The valued rent of the parish amounts
to about 3980 L. 9 s. 8 d.  The real rent may be about 1800 L.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The patronage of the church was,
some time after the beginning of last century, vested in the
proprietors of the estates of Benholme, Brotherston, and Ne-

parish, and a third, occasionally.  The church, which stands
nearly in the centre, and most agreeable part of the parish, is
an old irregular Gothic building.  On the East end, a part is

*About the beginning of the last century, the greatest part of the pro-
perty within this district belonged to Earl MARISCHAL, whose ancient domi-

scriptions.  Not long after that period, all this parish, except BALANDRO,
formed the estate of Benholme, and belonged to a proprietor of the name of
KEITH, who was probably a younger branch, or near relation of the Maris-
chal Family.  It was afterwards divided among his heirs into four portions,
which now compose different estates of Benholme, Brotherston, Nether.  Ben-
holme, and Knox.
