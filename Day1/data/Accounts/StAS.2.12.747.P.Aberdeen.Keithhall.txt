   Alehouses.-There is no public-house in the parish; but there

   Fuel.-The fuel is of peat and turf, the expense of preparing.
which is 1s. the cart-load.

                        GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
   The greatest variations observable, within the last forty years,
are in the value of houses and enclosures, which has risen from
L.150 to above L.3000; and in the ordinary provision for the
poor, which has beer tripled within that time.  The Earl of Kin-
tore gives, unsolicited, an annual donation, which is more than the
former yearly supply, then only L. 18.  The other heritors are
absentees, and draw their rents without remitting any return to
the poor; but it has not been necessary to solicit a contribution
from them.

                           PARISH OF INSCH.

               PRESBYTERY OF GARIOCH, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

                I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
    Name.-THE name Insch is generally considered to be of Cel-
tic origin, and to signify an island.  It is not improbable, that the
Insch had originally been confined to the small town or villages in
which the church stands, or, at all events, to the spot of ground
which forms the site of the village, and which bears some marks of
having been at one time surrounded with water.
   Extent,&c.-The parish is of an irregular figure.  Were one
part of it, however, taken away, namely the Daugh of Moreal,
which there is reason to think had not extinct, called Rathmo-
real or Crhist-Kirk, the remains of whose church, surrounded by a
burial-ground, are quite adjacent, in the parish of Kennethmont,
the remainder would be pretty nearly an oblong, the greater mides,
