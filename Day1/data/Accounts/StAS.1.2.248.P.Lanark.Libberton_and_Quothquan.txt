     Statistical Account

   Castle has no fixed salary; being employed by the inhabitants,
in that part of the parish, to teach their children, merely on
account of their great distance from the schools in Libberton
and Quothquan.
   There is only one alehouse in the parish, which retails whis-
ky, porter, and small beer.  It does not appear, that it has any
bad effect upon the morals of the parishioners; the people in
this country being much less addicted to drinking than they
were 40 years ago.
   Twenty-five cottages have been pulled down, of converted
into stables, and stalls, within these 10 years, and 3 only have
been built within the same period.  This is an additional proof
of the depopulation of the parish.
