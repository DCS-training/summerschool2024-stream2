economy, by holding out the prospect of support, to a certain de-
gree, when they become sick or infirm.
   Saving Bank.-A few years ago we had a saving bank, which
succeeded very well for a short time, and considerable sums were
lodged in it. The principal contributors were the members of two
youth's societies in the parish, tradesmen, and servants both male
and female. But the members, taking alarm at some enactments
that were made by the Legislature concerning saving banks, broke
it up. Since that time there does not appear any desire among
the people to have another established.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons
upon the poor's roll for the last seven years, is 39. They re-
ceive annually from L. 2 to L. 4, 10s. each, according to their se-
veral circumstances. Besides these, there are many that receive
occasional relief, whose poverty is not so great as to render it ne-
cessary to put them on the roll. The annual amount of con-
tributions for their relief, arising from church collections, mort-
cloths, &c. is from L. 31 to L. 34. The only other fund for the
relief of the poor is an assessment of L. 110 annually, which is laid
on and levied, in equal parts, twice a-year. It is matter of deep
regret that there is no disposition among the poor to refrain from
asking parochial relief, and so far are they from considering it as
degrading, that they claim it as a legal right.
   Ale-houses.-There are five public, or rather dram-houses in the
parish; and their effects upon the lower orders of society are of the
most demoralizing nature. There were lately more, but they were
fortunately suppressed, and the writer of this is most anxious to
have them still farther reduced.
   Fuel.-Coal is the only fuel, of which there is great abundance
in the parish; price at the pit from 6s. to 9s. per ton, according to
the quality.
