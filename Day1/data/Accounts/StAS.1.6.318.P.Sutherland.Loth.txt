at a very moderate expence in that bay.  In the summer time,
the people fish sand eels in the sand, and lobsters and crabs a-
amongst the rocks in the ebb.  Fuel is an expensive article on
account of the distance of the peats, and the badness of the
road; so that all the peats are carried home in back loads on
horses.  Some of the gentlemen have of late begun to import
coal, which though dear, they have found to be very conveni-
ent.  There are quarries of lime stone and free stone on the
shore; as also some detached blocks of a very hard and beauti-
ful kind of granite, which Jones, who travelled the country
lately in quest of natural curiosities, says, is susceptible of a
fine polish, and the besst he ever saw except the Italian.  There

   Population, Horses, Cattle, and Sheep.-As there are no

land; few of whom return.  No account has been kept of
these emigrants, and therefore their number cannot be ex-
actly ascertained.  It appears by a decreet of locality in
1722, that the number of catechizable persons at that time
was 1000.  The return to Dr Webster in 1755 was 1193 souls.
And in spring 1791, the number of the whole inhabitants a-
mounted to 1370.  They purchase yearly several horses at
the Dornoch markets, as the manuring the ground with sea-
ware, which, as well as peats, they carry on horse back loads,
occasions a great consumption of that species, of which there
are about 500 in constant work, and very few of them are
