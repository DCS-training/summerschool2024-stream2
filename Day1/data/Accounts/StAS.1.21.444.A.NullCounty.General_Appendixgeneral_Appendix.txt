vertical clouds, appearing in perspective, as if they drew to
a point, at each extremity, and on this account, called by
the people, Noah's Ark; and it is frequently found that the
wind which follows this appearance, blows directly across the
lines formed by the clouds.  It is also noticed, that even halos
or circles round the sun, if they extend themselves, are
followed by fair weather; though it is the reverse, if they
contract and draw near the sun's orb.  The falling of the
mercury in barometers, suddenly, is generally accompanied
with an uncommon noise among the crows in Wamphray
linns, and soul weather succeeds.  We are accommodated
with two conspicuous weather hills, Criffle to the south, and
Queensberry to the west.  The piercing heights of Skiddaw
Fell in Cumberland, are also seen from our high grounds;
from all which places, the settling vapours give notice of ap-
proaching rains.
   To accommodate things to the climate of the place, the
farmer endeavours to have his sown grass made, and in sum-
mer ricks, by the end of July; leaving the cutting of his
meadow grass till the Lammas rains cease.  If he sow pease,
he chuses the hot seed, to prevent their growing too late.
He mingles rye grass with his clover, to help to win it the
sooner.  He sets the ends of all his corn stacks to the south.
And when he has got his corn into stacks, he delays not to
thatch them.  Builders are at pains to lay the stones, so as
to hang a little, and throw out the rain; they also prefer
that kind of slated roofs, which is done upon laths, and all
the inside rendered with lime.  A kind of roof is frequently
used, of thin red freestone; but it is heavy; and unless the
stone be well chosen, and laid sheep enough, it draws through
the pores, and the rendering falls off.  Our sheep farmers
have not got into the use of circular dykes; but a planta-
tion of fir trees, in form of across, answers the purpose much
