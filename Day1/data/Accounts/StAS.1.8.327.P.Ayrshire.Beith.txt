ly beautiful.  The lime stone abounds with petrifactions of
shells, entrochi and other marine productions; the exuviae of
the ancient ocean.  In the lands of Robert Montgomery Esq.
of Bogstown, some years ago, filicious petrifactions were dis-
covered, similar to those found in calcareous substances; the
shells possessing the specific qualities of the flint in which they
were incorporated.  There curious and uncommon produc-
tions of nature were probably the first of the kind discovered
in this part of the world; at least they were the first that
some of the ablest chemists in this country had seen.  Silici-
ous petrifactions have been since found both in England and
Scotland, but very rarely.

   Proposed Improvements.-The cultivation of trees is much
neglected in this country.  Excepting the policies, or pleasure
grounds, around a few country feats, there is very little grow-
ing wood in this neighbourhood, though there are few places
where it is more necessary.  Were proprietors to plant a
small proportion of their land, it would certainly prove of
great advantage to the soil, as well as afford a shelter for
cattle, in so exposed a situation.
   Were a navigable canal carried across the country, from
the Clyde below Paisley, to the sea at Irvine or Saltcoats, it
would be of essential service to this part of the kingdom, and
to the public in general.  The distance is upwards of 20
miles.  Nature seems to point out the line of communica-
tion, through a narrow strath, running in that direction most
of the way.  In the middle of this strath stands the loch of
Kilbirnie, about an equal distance from each end of the pro-
posed canal, and it occupies also nearly the highest ground be-
tween them.  A stream runs from the north end of this loch in-
to the Clyde below Paisley, and the water of Garnock, running
