     Statistical Account

by principal farmers and their subtenants, is 59.  The number
of ploughs is 94, commonly drawn by 6 or 8 oxen, and a few
on the smaller farms, by 2 horses and 2 oxen.-The quan-
tity of barley sown yearly, is calculated to be 774 bolls; of
oats 1056 bolls; and of pease and rye 290 bolls.

   Rent.-The valuation of the parish, as it stands in the cess
books, amounts to L. 442I: 10: 10 Scotch.  The real rent, as
paid in barley, and from a few farms, partly in barley, and
partly in oat meal, amounts to 2352 bolls, which, converted
at 12 s. the boll, is equal in money to L. 1411: 4 s sterling.-
There is a money rent besides, of L. 340: 4: 10 sterling, which,
added to the former, makes the whole rent to L. 1751: 8: 10
sterling.-Oat meal is now always received and paid away by
weight, and 9 stones is the common standard of the country
for a boll, and where meal is mixed, as in the rent paid from
mills, 12 1/2 stones are put to a boll.-One farmer pays his rent
in money, at a conversion of 10 s. the boll, another farmer pays
the half of it at a conversion of 11 s.  Some of the farms where
the soil is richest, are let at the rent of 30 s. the acre of arable
ground; some of them pay from 20 s. to 26 s. or from 15 s. to
20 s. and other farms are set at 10 s. and under; but at an a-
verage, the rent may be calculated at 11 s. 9 d. the acre of ara-
ble ground.  The muir and pasture lands are not comprehend-
ed in this estimate, these are considered as pendicles of the
farm, but being open and common to every one, throughout
a great part of the year, the farmer can count very little on his
profits from them.
   The parish produces much more corn than is sufficient for
the support of the inhabitants.  The victual rents are sold
yearly, to be carried to other parts of the kingdom, or used
in the country, by distillers, and those living in towns, or the
Highlands.
