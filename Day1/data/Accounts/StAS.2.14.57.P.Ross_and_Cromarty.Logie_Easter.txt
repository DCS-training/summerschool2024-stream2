hope that those whose duty it is, will consider this matter serious-
ly, and take steps for diminishing the number of these houses. As
the parishioners (at least many of them) have no regular employ-
ment, except in harvest, they have not a sufficient spur to industry,
and must consequently feel the uncomfortable effects of straitened
circumstances.-" But Godliness with contentment is great gain."

                 UNITED PARISH OF

             KILMUIR WESTER AND SUDDY.
 
      PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OF ROSS.

     THE REV. ALLAN M'KENZIE, MINISTER.*


        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-KILMUIR signifies in Gaelic "a church dedicated to
Mary;" and Suddy, "a good place to settle in." The parish is now
commonly called Knockbain, from the name of the spot on which
the kirk and manse are built. It is bounded on the south by the
Moray Frith ; on the north-west by part of the parish of Killear-
nan. Its length from east to west is from 5 to 6 miles; and from
south to north from 6 to 7.
   Geoloqy.-The rocks in this parish belong to the old red sand-
stone formation of geologists.
                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   Antiquities.-It is generally understood that a battle took place
in this parish, in the thirteenth century, between the Macdonalds
and the inhabitants of Inverness. The field on which it happen-
ed is called Blair-na-coi; and it still bears the vestiges of many
cairns placed there as a monument of the event.
   Eminent Men.-Among the distinguished characters born in
this parish, may be mentioned the late General Mackenzie.
John Randall Mackenzie was the son of Mackenzie of Suddy,
a very old family in this county. He early entered into the
marine service of his country, and afterwards went into the line,
where he rose to the rank of major-general.
