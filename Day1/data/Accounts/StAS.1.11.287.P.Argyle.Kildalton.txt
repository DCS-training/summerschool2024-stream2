barley; so that they cannot have a good crop of oats.  The
gentlemen farmers, again, employ almost their whole time in
rearing, good black cattle, and lay out their fine arable ground
in feeding them; in consequence of which, the cultivation of
grain is very little attended to.  All the farmers here plow
with 4 horses, excepting a very few, who, having light ploughs,
employ only 2.  The rest make use of heavy clumsy ploughs,
of their own manufacture.  They carry out their manure in
small creels on horseback, and they bring home their peats in
the same manner; whereby much time is spent in doing very
little work.  This is partly owing to the want of good public
roads; for the inhabitants only work at them 2 days in the
year, and the statute labour is never commuted.  They do
little or nothing for the reparation of private roads.  It is
much to be wished, that the tenants knew the value of good
roads, and that they would employ carts to manure the
ground, as they do in the next parish, where they have a
good public road, which is upheld at a small expence to the
tenants.  The people of Killarow are encouraged to improve
a little in agriculture, by the example of Mr. Campbell of
Shawfield, who is one of the best farmers in the west of Scot-
land:  And perhaps his Islay estate is capable of as much im-
provement as any in the kingdom.

   Inclosures.-There is only a very small part of this parish
inclosed; and the large parks, that the principal tenants have
made, are employed for feeding their young black cattle in
winter.  These parks are very seldom, if ever, plowed; and
in harvest no beast is fed in them, as they are kept for winter
grass.  The parish might easily be inclosed, for we abound in
stones; and the want of inclosures is severely felt in this pa-
rish, where we are so much exposed to every wind that blows,
