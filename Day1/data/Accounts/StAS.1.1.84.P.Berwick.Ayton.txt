at an average, is about 1 s. 2 d. weekly.  The other half is
distributed under the inspection of the kirk-session in occa-
tional charities.  Part of it, together with the money arising-
from marriages and the use of the paH (mort-cloth) is applied
to educate poor children and pay church officers.  The ex-
pence incurred for the maintenance of the parochial poor has
increased near two thirds during the incumbency of the pre-

   Price of Provisions.-The price of butcher meat is from
3 1/2 d. to 4 d. per lb. English weight; it has advanced about
1 d. per lb. within these 6 or 8 years.  The price of pork is

for 4 d. per lb.  The prices of grain may be ascertained from

   Wages.-The wages of a labourer are 1 s. a day; a car-

corn is usually paid by what is termed lot, i.e. 1 boll is allowed
for every 25 bolts that are threshed.  The wages of a mason
and his labourer, etc. are generally settled at so much a rood.
A hind receives 2 bolls of barley, 1 boll of pease, and 10 bolls
of oats; he has a cow's grass, a house and yard, and as much
ground as will serve to plant a firlot of potatoes.  He is like-
