   Mortifications for Bursaries.-In the year 1648, Sir Tho-
mas Burnett of Leys, Baronet, mortified certain lands for
the support of bursars at King's College; and in 1679 Wal-
ter Ogilvy of Redhyth bequeathed his whole estate for the
same purpose, and for the maintenance of scholars at the
school of Fordyce.  These were the first considerable addi-
tions made to the original number of bursars; and similar
donations have since been frequent*.

   King William's Grant of 200 l.; etc.-King William hav-
ing granted, in the year 1695, the sum of 200 l. per annum
for the behoof of King's College, a considerable part of this
sum was afterwards assigned as a salary to the professor of
oriental languages: and the College was thereby relieved from
the expence of the salary which had been provided for this
office at the time of its first institution in 1674.  His Majes-
ty at the same time assumed the right of patronage to the of-
fice to himself and successors.
