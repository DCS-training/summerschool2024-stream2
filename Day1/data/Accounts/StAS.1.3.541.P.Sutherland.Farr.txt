   Agriculture.-There are 50 ploughs in the parish; but
most of the farmers delve their land.  The plough is drawn
with 4 horses a breast.  They generally saw in April and
May, and reap in September and the beginning of October.
Very little of the parish is cultivated, compared with what
is lying waste and common.  It is, therefore, by no means
surprising, that it does not supply its inhabitants with provi-
sions.  In 1782, there were 1000 bolls imported.  The si-
tuation of the people, in 1783, was deplorable.  They 
the few cattle tehy had, and eat their slesh without bread or
salt.  Many left the parish, and went to other places for
employment.

   Rent.-The land rent is about 1255 L.  The fishing of
Naver is 100 L.  and upwards.  The average rent of farms
is about 5 L.  The parish, in general, is not inclosed;
but such as have tried inclosures are convinced of their ad-
vantages.  There has been no change of property in land
here for these many years.

   Church.-The church was built in 1774.  The manse was
repaired last year.  The stipend is 800 merks, or 44 L. 8 s.
10 d.  Sterling, and 3 L. 6 s. 4 d. for a glebe.  A process of
augmentation is commenced.  The Countess of Sutherland
is patron.  There are 2 heritors and a wadsetter; but none
of them reside in the parish.

   Poor.-The number of poor receiving alms is 54.  The
annual amount of the contributions for their support is 6 L.
10 s. besides mort-cloth dues, which are about 1 L.  10 s. per
annum, with the interest of 5 L. left by Mr Skeldach.
