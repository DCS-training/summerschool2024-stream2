fides those fed on turnips, the number of which cannot be
ascertained.

   Sheep-Horses and black cattle are here objects of inferior con-
fideration to sheep, for which all parts of the parish are well a-
dapted.  According to the best information, their number
must be nearly 5000; some farmers thinking it greater, and
some less.  This number, which cannot be far from the truth,
is maintained on little more than 6000 acres; from which
circumstance, some idea may be formed of the value of the
pasture.  They are, in general, of the long bodied kind; ra-
ther small, feeding only to 8 1/2 lb. rarely to 10 lb. per quarter,
on the hill, but improving to 12 1/2 lb. and even to 15 lb. per
quarter, in sheltered inclosures.  The dryness of the pasture,
and small size of the sheep, give them a juice remarkably rich,
and a flavour remarkably delicate.  Their wool is not fine,
yielding only about 12 s. per stone of 24 lb.  English, and
taking 8 or 9 fleeces to a stone.  The value of it is lessened by
the quantity of tar, with which, it is the universal practice,
to salve the sheep, being fully equal to that of oil or butter;
but, in this neighbourhood, farmers now begin to use, 2 and e-
ven 3 points of oil, or melted butter, to one point or tar, and think
their wool is improved by this change.  Judges assert, that
smearing is, in general, unskillfully performed in this corner,
the season being too far advanced, and the ingredients being
both improperly proportioned, and carelessly laid on.  With-
out entering into points, which must be determined solely by
the experience of store farmers, it is natural to think, that
this operation should take place early in the season, before the
days shorten; because quantities of rain and snow, are then
apt to fall; and when the sheep are once thoroughly drench-
ed, they do not readily become dry enough to receive the
salve to advantage.  Besides, the first attacks of cold and wet
