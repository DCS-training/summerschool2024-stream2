     Statistical Account

   The number of farms in the parish has been reduced, with-
in these 50 or 60 years past, nearly one-half.  There are in it
at present about 14 farmers; but 4 or 5 of these have very small
farms, on which a family can hardly subsist without some o-
ther occupation.  The largest farms do not exceed 130 acres
of good arable land: besides these, there are between 50 and
60 acres of good ground parcelled out among the trades people
in the different villages, to enable them to keep cows for the
use of their families, and one horse each, for labouring joint-

the neighbouring market towns.  The number of household
and labouring servants, chiefly the latter, employed by the
farmers, exclusive of their children, is 88; that of artificers,
57, of whom 44 are weavers, who not only work for the in-
habitants of the parish, and others who may employ them, but
also manufacture for sale, a great deal chiefly of what they
call Ham, and coarse packing cloth, for which they find a rea-
dy market in the town of Dundee.

the same in this as in the neighbouring parishes, particularly
that of Kilspindy, accounts of which have been already publish-
ed.  The method of dividing farms into 6 parts is generally
practised.  The best crops of wheat, both for quantity and
quality, are from land well prepared by summer fallowing and
liming, which always compensate the farmer for his trouble,
expence, and the loss of one crop.  After fallow, wheat, pease,
and beans are sown, and for the most part ploughed down as
early in spring as the weather will permit; after this, barley
with clover grass feed is sown; and good grass seldom fails to
be succeeded by a luxuriant crop of oats.  The small quantities
of flax, potatoes, and turnip, raised in the parish, come in un-
