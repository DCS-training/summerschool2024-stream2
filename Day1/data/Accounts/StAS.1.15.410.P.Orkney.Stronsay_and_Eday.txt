   The present gross rental of Stronsay and Eday, compre-
hending superiority, property, and stipend, amounts to only
746 L. 7 s. 3 d. Sterling, a small part of which is paid by sti-
pulation between some of the heritors and their tenants, for
liberty to the latter to burn kelp and to sell it on their own
account.
   The advance of rent, in these united parishes, during a pe-
riod of no less than 140 years, appears inconsiderable, but
this is accounted for by a very great proportion of the gross
rental in 1653, being paid in kind; some part of which hath
been converted into money by the heritors to the tenants,
about 40 years ago, and such past as is still paid in kind, cal-
culated at the then selling prices of the country, which did
not much exceed the valuation prices in 1653.
