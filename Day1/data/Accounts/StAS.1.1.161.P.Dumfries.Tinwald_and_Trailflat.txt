indeed would be very necessary, on the supposition of the
tide flowing there.  Lochar, after a course of 11 or 12 miles
below this, falls into the Solway Frith.  It abounds with
pike.  The most of this parish is arable.  The southern part
is much more fertile than which lies towards the north
and east; and the harvest, in general, is three or four weeks
earlier.  The southern part is of a deep dry loamy soil, and
produces wheat, barley, and oats, of the best quality.  The
north-east part produces all these, though of an inferior qua-
lity, the soil being mostly wet, and lying on a bed of till.
A gentle rising ridge, running from north to south, divides
the united parish.

   Air and Distempers.-The air, in general, is dry, and rec-
koned healthy.  There have been no prevalent distempers
during these last 30 years.  The measles are sometimes fatal,
especially to adults; but they seldom appear above once in
10 or 12 years.  The small-pox was justly dreaded about
20 years ago; but , as innoculation is now generally adopted,
that disease is become less fatal.

   Agriculture, Sheep, Etc.-Agriculture was in a very imper-
fect state previous to 1762.  Potatoes of a proper kind, and
the planting of them with the plough in drill rows, was in-
troduced after this period, as well as the cultivation of clover
and rye-grass.  Lime and manure were unknown, except on
a few acres of what is called croft-land, which was never our
of crop.  Every farm, except grass ones, of between L 30
and L. 40 of yearly rent, may be stated as raising 2 acres of 
wheat, 4 of barley, about 14 or 15 of oats, and 2 of potatoes.
Rye is not much cultivated here, as it is thought to be a 
robbing crop.  The raising of turnip is found to be beneficial,
and has increased greatly within these two years, The far-
