greatly these imperfect short levels, there were many fields
of coal which could not thus be drained but at a most enor-
mous expence, in driving subterraneous mines:  In this stage
of carrying on the work, there were employed at least two
men at the windlass, putting up the coals in skiffies, termed
hutches; and it is more than probable that they had likewise
to pully up the water for a considerable time every morning,
before the workmen had got the coals raised; the coal busi-
ness in this district was carried on in this slovenly manner
during this century:  The country was ill supplied; the land-
lards complained that they never made a shilling of their
coal, while every person was surprised, that a district, posses-
ting such natural advantages, should make so little good use
of them.  About two years ago, coal becoming exceeding-
ly scarce, and the price rising suddenly, there became an ab-
solute necessity of working it in a better style; accordingly,
Mr Dunmore of Ballindalloch, a gentleman to whose activi-
ty and patriotism this part of Scotland is much indebted, be-
coming the lessee of several works in the parish, he imme-
diately erected gins, driven by horses, for pulling up the coals;
which improvement is answering the purpose, and is either
already, or will be quickly followed by the other proprietors;
so that now we have every probability of this necessary arti-
cle of life being wrought in a style far superior and more ex-
peditious than hitherto experienced.
   All the coalliers in this parish now work with the pick and
wedge: this, however, is only a late improvement; they pool
in the middle of the seam, where a small band of stone, about
an inch of thickness, lyes, called the pooling band, and then
shear down what is above, stiled the roof coal, and drive up the
soal coals with wedges; they carry on their drifts or rooms eight
feet by fourteen, leaving stoops eight feet by twelve; but this
