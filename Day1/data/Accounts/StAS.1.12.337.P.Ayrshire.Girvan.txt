once in 3 years.  A quantity of salmon is annually caught at
the mouth of the Girvan*.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the num-
ber of souls in 1755 was 1193.  Of the ancient state of popu-
lation in the parish, no certain information can be obtained.
No regular register of deaths and marriages was kept prior to
August 1783, when the tax on registers was imposed.  For
about 5 years after that period, this register was accurately
kept+.  A register of births has been preserved since the lat-
ter end of the year 1733.  From an attention to this, so far
as it goes, some probable conjecture concerning the state of
population at different periods may be formed: and a compa-
rative view of the former and present situation of the parish
in this respect may be taken.  For this purpose, there is an-
nexed a table of births for 10 years succeeding December
1733; and another for 10 years prior to January 1791: to
which is added a table of deaths and marriages for 5 years suc-
ceeding December 1783.

they bring from 2 d. to 3 d. the 1 b. English.  But the greater part is carried by
land to Kilmarnock or Glasgow.  It is believed that abundance of cod, ling,
haddock, etc. is also to be found off this coast; but the inhabitants of this pa-
rish have never much availed themselves of their advantage in this respect.
   +As soon as it was generally known that the act imposing a tax on registers,
did not oblige any person to keep a register; and that the only penalty for ne-
glecting to pay the tax, was the non-entry of the name in the register: the con-
sequence in this parish has been, that the register of deaths has, for some time,
been totally given up, and those of births and marriages are not so accurate as
they should be.
