deed, excepting upon the estates of the Duke of Argyle, the
Earl of Bredalbane, and a few others, small tenants in this
country are very well satisfied when they can subsist their fa-
milies, and pay thier rents, without the addition of one shilling
to their little stock.  Two families only have emigrated to
North America from this parish, for half a century.

   Miscellaneous Remarks.-The inhabitants are all of the Esta-
blished church; and, to very few, have all been born in the
parish, and baptized by the present incumbent, who is near
80 years of age, and the oldest member of the synod of Ar-
gyle.-They are a sober, regular, industrious set of people;
generous, humane, high spirited, and loyal, when called to 
the exertion of those qualities.  In the year 1745, 80 able
young volunteers offered their services to their country; and,
headed by the minister, appeared at the cross of Inverary in less
than 24 hours after he had received intimation, from the Duke
of Argyle, of this Grace's desire that he should repair thither,
without loss of time, with as many of his parishioners as could
conveniently be spared.-If occasion still required, the inha-
bitants of this parish would, with equal alacrity, turn out to
defend their gracious sovereign, and that happy constitution,
under which they enjoy such invaluable blessings.
