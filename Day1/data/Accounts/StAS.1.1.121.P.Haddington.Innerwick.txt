of Dunbar, and synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.  It
extends from the sea, on the north, about 12 miles south-
wards.  On the coast, it is not above 2 miles broad, but gra-
dually swells towards the south, and in some places may
be 5 or 6 miles broad.  It is bounded on the west by the
parishes of Spott and Dunbar; on the south by Cranshaws
and Longformacus; on the east by Oldhamstocks; and on the 
north by the sea.  The face of the country is level, and the
soil rich.  From the church towards the south the parish is

places on the coast, the soil is rather light and gravelly.  The
shore is rocky.
