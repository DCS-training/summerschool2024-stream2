may be reckoned considerable.  There are 4 of them non-
residing; but on the estates of the non-residing heritors im-
provements are going forward in various kinds, as well as
on the estates of those who constantly reside.  The land-
rent of the parish is not nearly equal to the expenditure of
the proprietors; their other properties and resources are very

houses in the parish amount to about 600; the black cattle

flock of about 100 of the black-faced Linton breed.  They

flicts*.  The last charter in favour of the burgh was grant-
