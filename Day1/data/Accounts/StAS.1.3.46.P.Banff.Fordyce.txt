     Statistical Account

   The general appearance of the country is rather flat, with
many inequalities and rising grounds.  There are two small
and contiguous hills, those of Fordice and Durn, about a
mile south from the sea, besides the Knockhill at the south-
west extremity, much higher than the two preceding, an d
which separtes this parish from part of Grange and Ordi-
quhill.

   The coast or shore is high and rocky, with the exception
of a few bays, such as those of Portsoy and Sandend.

   Many sorts of fishes are caught on the coast, ling, cod,
tuik, haddock; besides dog, whiting, mackarel, holybut,
turbot, cat, and slouder of various kinds.  Lobsters,
crabs, clams, limpits, and periwinkles.  The principal
market for the first four kinds was Leith and the South
Frith; but now the fishers say they suffer such exactions at
Leith, (a strange policy upon an article of provisions) that
they seldom proceed to that marker, and sell betwixt this
and the South Frith.  There are corallines on the coasts,
and from samples taken up on the fishers lines or hooks, it
is believed a few corals and sponges.  There are large thoals
of herrings and considerable numbers of seals, purposes, and
sometimes whales, and sharks, seen on the coast.  The lime-
stone on the coast is frequently persorated by a species of
small muscle, which live and grow in the stones.  The fish
of this kind called pbolades in Italy, have three or four shells,
ours, like common muscles, only two.  There might be
large quantities of kelp made on the coast.  However, the
great quantity of both tangle, and belly-weed, which grows
on the sea rocks, when by storms loosened and disengaged
from them, and cast ashore, are carefully gathered and used
