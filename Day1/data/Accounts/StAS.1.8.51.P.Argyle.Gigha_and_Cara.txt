parate from other cattle, they are to fell them off, it being
found, that when they are not kept by themselves, they dege-
nerate, and prevent the improvement of black cattle; a thing
too much neglected formerly in this place.  But by this plan,
it is not intended to banish this useful animal from the island
altogether.  As there are some points of land, forming so
many peninsulae which can be easily inclosed, it is meant to
keep a certain number of a good kind for the convenience of
mutton, and the improvement of the finer kind of wool.  At
present the small highland kind of mutton fells at 7 s. 8 d.,
lamb at 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s.-A good many swine are reared; but
the damage they do among the pasture ground is greater than
any advantage they bring.  Till such time. therefore, as
proper method of confining and feeding them can be adopted,
it were better to banish them altogether, which the proprietor
means to do, unless they are kept in a hog fence.  They are
fold at from 16 s. to 1 l. 4s.  A pig costs from 1 s. 6d. to
s. 6 d., according to its age.

   Wild Animals, Poultry. etc.-The only destructive animal
is a small species of wild cat, which seldom comes near the
farm houses, but keeps near the shore and among cairns, where
it kills rabbits, of which there are many in the island.  Rats
and mice are sometimes troublesome.  The amphibious ani-
mals are seals and otters, but not very numerous.-There be-
ing no foxes, polecats, weasels, etc. poultry of all kinds are
rented in great plenty.  A goose sells at 1 s. 6 d.; a good hen
at 6d.; a chicken at 3d.; and a dozen of eggs at 2d.  In
winter the island is visited by the swan. and woodcock,
in summer by the swallow, corncraik (or cornrail), and cuckoo.
The other birds frequenting it are, wild geese, ducks, and all
the species of sea fowl common on the west coast:  Pigeons,
plovers, ravens, hooded crows, starlings, sparrow hawks, and
