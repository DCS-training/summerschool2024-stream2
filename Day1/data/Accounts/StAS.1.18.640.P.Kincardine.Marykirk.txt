     Statistical Account

vate and improve our fields, if we leave the great author of
nature, the fountain-head of all happiness, out of our schemes
of improvement.  That a settled disregard to the superinten-
dence of the Almighty has been increasing in every corner
of the land for several years, and that too, to the most alarm-
ing height, is as obvious as any demonstration in Euclid.
Some there are, who seemingly pay God no homage at all,
others who pretend to believe in him as the author and giver
of all the good gifts they enjoy; but at the same time, present
him with nothing in return, but such oblations and services,
as would be accounted the highest insult to any earthly bene-
factor.  Properly to explain and illustrate this subject would
take up more room than might be deemed necessary or pro-
per for a Statistical Report.  However, one thing is certain,
that God is dishonoured, his subject are not sufficiently
grateful and obedient to him.  He requires a higher venera-
tion, better obedience, and a more rational and respectful
service.  Men may for a time insult and pour contempt upon
his Majesty, but there is a period when they must stop, and a
fine and boundary which they dare not pass over.  When
they serve him with fidelity, he blesses them with plenty;
when they lessen their regards, he is still indulgent, but must
lessen the streams of his bounty: but when they grow despe-
rately mad, and reject and despise him altogether, he then re-
sumes his power, and is ready to destroy, by his Almighty
vengeance.  We have seen the castigations of heaven, severe-
ly punishing for a long season, that irreligious and cruel na-
tion we have been and are yet contending with; and we
might have seen too, if we had opened our eyes to behold the
agency of providence, some indications of Divine displeasure
against that country that gave us birth, and which we are all
bound to love and succour above any other nation in the
world: but how can we love our country, if we are strangers
