cultivated districts.  Open and frank in their manners; keen
in their attachments; chearful to return favours, and no less
ardent to resent affronts; equally ignorant of the cautious
reserve of people hackneyed in the ways of men, and averse
to the plodding perseverance acquired in the more busy walks
of society.  The general tenor of their moral deportment is
decent and regular; and few among them have been accused

There is a dwelling-house for the schoolmaster, and a house
for teaching.  English, Latin, writing, arithmetic, geometry,

branches of literature, have received the first elements of
