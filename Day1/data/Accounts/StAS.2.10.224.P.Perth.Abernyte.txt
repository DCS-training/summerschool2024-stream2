             want of enclosures in most places, especially on the higher ground
             for sheep, are great'additional disadvantages; so that a consider-
             able proportion of the land is in the landlord's own hands.
                The old valuation of the parish, according to the cess-book, is
             L. 1126, 13s. 4d.  Scots.
                Produce.-It is difficult to ascertain completely the gross amount
             of raw produce.  But the following statement seems to approxi-
             mate to the truth.

                There are few trees full-grown in the parish, and it is seldom
             that any of them are cut down.  The- profits of thinning and prun-
             ing young trees do not much exceed the expense as yet; and the
             profits arising from feeding cattle are already included in the
             value of the raw produce.  There is no trade nor manufacture here,
             but for domestic purposes.

                                   V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
               There are a few small bridges here in tolerable repair.  The
             roads, within these few years, have been Macadamised, and kept in
             good order without a toll.  Some of the fences are pretty good.
             But three-fourthg of the land are unfortunately defenseless.
               Ecclesiastical State.-The church is at the lowest extremity of
             the parish, near three miles from the tbinly inhabited places above.
             But it is commodiously situated for the extremities of some neigh-
             bouring parishes.  The church was rebuilt in the year 1736, and
             has been lately repaired.  It may accommodate the whole po-
             pulation ; and there is no seat rent.  The people are very ac-
             commodating to one another, and to strangers.  The manse seems
             as old as the church.i But about 1820, the manse received con-
             siderable repairs and additions, partly at the expense of the in-
             cumbent, as well as of the heritors; for the accommodation was
             too little. But now, it is as commodious as can well be expect-
             ed. The grebe consists nearly of 7 acres arable, besides 3 of pas-
             ture, and a pretty large garden.  Being a. small living, the sti-
