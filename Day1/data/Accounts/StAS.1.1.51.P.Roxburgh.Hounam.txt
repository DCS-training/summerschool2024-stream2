   The number of burials do not exceed 4 each year.  The
births are from 10 to 12, exclusive of the sectaries, who are
indeed but few, and have a register of baptisms of their

L. 4.  Fifteen or twenty years ago, the wages of men ser-
vants were about L. 5, and of women scarcely L. 3.  The
wages of the shepherds, who constitute one half of the parish,

farm to which they belong.  The people enjoy a considerable

the parish, (especially since sheep and wool brought so high
