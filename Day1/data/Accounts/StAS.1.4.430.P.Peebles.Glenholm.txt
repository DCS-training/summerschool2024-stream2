430       Statistical Account

of the braes and flats along the water, there is arable
ground, which produces very good grain; the higher parts
are a mixture of green and heath; but the tops of the hills
are generally heath. The strath becomes narrower, and
terminates in a high hill, which separates this parish from
that of Cultar. In the lower end of the parish, where the
river crosses the high road, the country opens to the north
east on both sides. This parish hath also a considerable ex-
tent from north to south; it begins about 3/4 of a mile north
from Holm's water, and runs south along the Dumfries
road upwards of 4 miles, 3 of which are upon the banks of
Tweed. By far the greatest part is sheep pasture; the a-
rable ground is generally of a loose and sharp soil, of a
moderate depth, and in the spots that are best cultivated,
the crops are strong and very productive. As this country
is high and hilly, the air is damp, impregnated with va-
pour; mists frequently hover about the tops of the hills;
the clouds are often intercepted in their course, by the hills
and the head of this strath, and brought down, so that we
have more frequent rains than in the low country: hence
it is often a wet day at the head of this water, when it is
dry weather in the lower end of the parish; but notwith-
standing dampness is the general quality of the air in this
place, there have been seasons when it has suffered severely
through drought. Colds and rheumatisms seem to be the
prevailing distempers. There is a slate quarry, which con-
tinued for many years to be wrought, but was some time
ago given up. There is also a limestone quarry, which
provides the farmers in this neighbourhood with lime for
improving their land.
