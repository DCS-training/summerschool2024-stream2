   The proprietors of Boquhan and Micklewood are the only
heritors of distinction who reside in the carse; and their houses
and plantations appear beautiful from the heights.  The ve-
nerable oaks of Micklewood, attract the attention of every vi-
sitor.  Nor can we omit to mention the row of firs, where
herons, time immemorial, have built their nests, and brought
forth their young.  These firs of Micklewood are the only
trees of the kind in the parish to which they resort, and Mr
Graham allows those trees to remain chiefly on their account.
   All the roads in the carse (excepting that of Boquhan and
Micklewood), are so extremely bad, that during the rainy

and even in this way it is with difficulty that the business
is accomplished.  When the farmers are spoken to indivi-

their roads, and seem anxious to assist in repairing them.  But

convenient forone, it is inconvenient for another.  Fair weather
comes, the road is dry and firm, and the matter drops.

   The best way would be, that the landlord should make good
roads to all the farms, and assess the tenants for the interest of
what money may be expended.  This mode would be accept-
able to them all, and of great advantage to the proprietor; as
when leases expire, easy access to the farm will be always one
of its most powerful recommendations.
   The houses on the carse farms are not good.  There are
two circumstances which must always prevent them from be-
ing so.  The first is, the farms are small, some twenty, and few
