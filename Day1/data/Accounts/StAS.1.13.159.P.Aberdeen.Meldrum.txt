with his single horse and cart to Aberdeen for them; so
that landholders may see, from the little that has been al-
ready done in this corner of the country, in the way of im-
provement, how much they have it in their power to ac-
celerate the progress of it by giving proper encourage-
ment to industrious tenants; yea those large tracts of waste
ground, to be seen every where through this country, some
of them covered with heath, but with evident traces of the
old ridges in them, might be brought inot cultivation.
This would give employment ot the industrious, prove or-
namental to the country, and perhaps more advantageous
to the proprietors, than the extension of property.
   Among the advantages from local situation, to the inha-
bitants of this parish and neighbourhood, a good weekly
market in Old Meldrum may be justly reckoned; where
the farmer, at any season of the year, can dispose of what-
ever part of the produce of his farm he can spare, and in
return bring home what may be wanted for the subsistence
of his family.  Leases are given to tenants for 19 and 33
years, with encouragement for good houses and fences, by
the proprietors agreeing to pay for the same at the end of
the lease, as they shall be then valued by two men mutu-
ally chosen.  All services formerly paid to the proprietor,
are mostly converted; the only servitude or usage they
now complain of, especially improving tenants, is the pay-
ment of mill-multures.  The inhabitants of Old Meldrum
are well supplied with fine spring water; and the distillery
and brewery have each of them the command of a small
stream of water.  Owing, it is thought, to the quality of
the water, the porter brewed here is in great repute.  The
greatest disadvantage the people of Old Meldrum labour un-
der, arises from the want of fuel.  But if the duty be taken
off the coals, this will encourage both the manufacturer and
farmer much, and prove a great benefit to the poor. It
