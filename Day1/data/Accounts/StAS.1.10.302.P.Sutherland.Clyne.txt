wheelwrights, (no gardners,) in the parish; but it can hard-
ly be said that any of these carry on business to any great pur-
pose, or live entirely by their craft.  There is one good miln
on the coast side, and six equally good in the heights; as also
three of the kind called Highland milns, whose wheels re-
volve in a horizontal direction.

   Rent-The writer cannot at present ascertain the exact
contents of the arable part of the parish in square measure,
nor even the valued rent or real, exactly; he thinks the real
rent will amount to 330 bolls of victual, and about 500 L.
Sterling.

   Ecclesiastical State, Poor, etc.-The present stipend is exact-
ly 80 bolls victual, and 22 L. 4 s. Sterling.  It was settled in
1722.  The incumbent has commenced a process of aug-
mentation.  There is no fund for the poor, except the week-
ly collections, which are very small, and inadequate to the sup-
ply of the few poor; but this defect is remedied by the alms
given by the inhabitants to the begging poor, at milns, and
their several dwellings.  There are no religious sects in the
parish.  All the inhabitants profess the established religion, and
attend public worship in the parish church.  There is a preach-
ing place, at the distance of about 8 miles from the church,
called Aschoile, upon loch Brora, where of late the inhabi-
tants of the parish have begun to bury their dead.  The mi-
nister usually performs public worship there every fourth
Sabbath; but, as the house at present is in disrepair, he can-
not attempt public service there, but in favourable weather.
There is no legal parish school, but there is a parish school-
master with 100 merks of salary, who teaches children read-
ing, writing, and a little arithmetic, in his own house.  There
is no society school now, but there was one in Strathbrora for
