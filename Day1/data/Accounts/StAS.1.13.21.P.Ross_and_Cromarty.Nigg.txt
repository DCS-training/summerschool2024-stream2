     Of Nigg.

property of Mr Cockburn Ross of Shandwicked, in a bank
removed at more than the distance of a mile from the sea,
and raised many feet above its level, there is a stratum of
oyster shells of considerable extent, and above a half foot in
depth; they lie about three feet below the surface of the
ground, and underneath them there is a stratum of fine sand,
like that on the sea-shore.  It is difficult to account for
their being there, without supposing the ground to have 
been some time covered by the sea; and to conceive that,
from the elevation of the ground, we must suppose the sea
to have ascended to a height that would make it overflow
a great part of the ground, not only of this, but of the
neighbouring parishes.-In that extensive piece of ground,
called the Sands of Nigg, and about a foot under the sur-
face, there is a stratum of different kinds of shells, of con-
siderable depth, many boat-loads of which are annually
dug up by the fishermen of a neighbouring parish, and made
by them into lime of a superior quality.  It is some time
before the pits from which they are taken, fill up and be-
come solid, which renders these sands dangerous, and some-
times fatal to passengers, especially to strangers, some of
whom falling into these pits before the tide is thoroughly
gone, unhappily lose their lives.-In that range of rocks
which over-hang the Murray frith, there is a number of
natural caves, some of which are so capacious that they
could contain from four to six hundred men a-piece.  The
entrance to them is narrow, but within they widen to a
great extent, are of an amazing height, and of a depth
which no man would incline to examine.  There are drops
of water constantly distilling from the upper part of these
caves, which, gradually petrifying, make them to appear
above like an arch of the finest marble.  In these, different
birds take up their residence, and numbers of pigeons
hatch their young in them.
