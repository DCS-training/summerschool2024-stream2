dykes.  From the foot of Lamer-moor hills, to the village of
Whittingham, the ground gradually descends, but unequally,
as it occasionally rises and falls.  The soil on the south side of
the water of Whittingham, is much inferior to that on the
south.  A great part of it is light and sandy, with a gravelly
bottom.  Other parts of it consist of a thin poor clay; but it
should be added, that there are several fields, in this part of
the parish, of a rich fertile soil.-To the north, the soil is
of a much superior quality.  Some of it is a rich deep loam;
but the greatest part consists of deep, strong, reddish clay, ca-
pable of producing finer crops, when the season is favourable,
than any land in the country.  But it must be observed, that
this kind of soil is extremely precarious, and very difficult to
manage to the best advantage; as either too much rain, or too
much drought, renders it unfit for cultivation.-The land
on the east of Whittingham, rises in a slow and gentle manner,
about 2 1/2 English miles, to the top of Blaikieheugh; but the
ascent is easy and insensible.-It is remarkable, that the soil
on this elevated ground, is of a rich, and even superior quali-
ty to any in the parts adjoining.

   Traprene Law.-About 1 1/2 mile northwest from the village,
stands Traprene-law; a little hill, or rock, of an oval form,
rising by itself, in an open country.  On the south side it is in-
accessible, and on the other sides, round the extremity of the
summit, there are the remains of an old dyke or wall, the
materials of which are large rough stones, rudely piled up one
above another.-It is probable, that it was constructed, by
the inhabitants of the adjoining country, in the days of barba-
rism, and was intended as a place of safety, when they were
invaded by the Danes or the English.  On such occasions they
went thither for shelter, and carried their cattle and effects a-
long with them.-This solitary rock was antiently called
