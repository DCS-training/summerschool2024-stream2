   Rivers and Lakers.-The only river of any note, besides
the Spey, is the Nethy, which, rising in the high hill, 
intersects the parish, running through or near the fit,
woods, for above 7 miles, and empties itself into the Spey.
In dry weather, it is very inconsiderable; but after rains or
thaws, it swells so as to bring down loose all the timber
that is cut in the woods, either to the saw-mills or to
the Spey, whence it is sent in refer to the sea at Gar-
mouth.  There are several lakes in Kinchardine; the most
considerable of which, is the oval bason in Glenmore, near-
ly two miles diameter.  It is in the bottom of the glen,
surrounded with sir-woods, rising gradually towards the
mountains.  Here is pleasant scene in a fine summer day.
In Glenmore likewise, there is a green loch in extent about
one acre, full of small fat green trout.  At the foot of Cairn-
gorm, is Loch Aven, from whence the river of that name
issues, containing plenty of trout, but dry and indifferent
ones to eat.

   Cave and Mountains.-At one end of this loch, surround-
ed with vast mountains, is a large natural cave, sufficient
to hold a number of men secure from snow, rain, or winds.
People often lodge here for nights, some from necessity 
others when hunting or fishing.  It is commonly called
Chlachthian, or the "Sheltering Stone." Of the whole 
range of mountains in view of the parish, the Cairngorm,
(or blue mountains), is the most remarkable.  Stones of va-
lue are sometimes sound at the near it, but rarely now, and

Gordon's forest and game, is 93, a blooming, correct sensible man, and
comes to church the coldest day in winter.  The last incumbent, Mr.
William Grant, who was 60 years minister of teh parish died in 75 
aged 90, and Robert Grant of Lugg in 1774, 97 years old.
