at a great distance.  The best view of them is from the
rising ground, at the west end of the village of Gar-

   Dryfields-The dryfields occupy the intermediate space,
between the muir and the carse grounds.  Their name sup-
poses that they are not subject to those floods, which frequent-

being considerably raised above the level of the carse, and their
gradual ascent to the bottom of the hills, which makes it im-

for the most part of such a light sandy soil, as quickly ab-
sorbs the rain, and shews the propriety of the name they
bear.
   The greatest part of the dryfields, until of late, lay waste
and wild, overrun with furze and broom.  Few of them were
subdivided or inclosed or cultivated in any considerable degree.
Plantations were not in use, and excepting on the sides of the
glens, scarcely any thing like a tree was to be seen.  But now
it is quite a new scene.  All the heritors have united in a
regular plan of inclosing with dykes and hedges.  Many of the
uncultivated spots are covered with thriving plantations.  The
country is adorned and the farms sheltered.
   In giving some account of the present state of the dryfields,

particular attention, as his unwearied exertions, in executing
an extensive plan of improvements for thirteen years past,
have beautified and enriched his lands, in a high degree.
   The plan has been carried on at an expence, exceeding at
times the rental of the estate; and yet such expenditure is not
lost, if by this means the value of the ground is proportion-
