and it is pleasant to find that his labours are duly appreciated by
the inhabitants at large.
  Fuel.-This article of domestic economy consists entirely of
coal, and is chiefly imported from Newcastle and the Frith of
Forth.  The farmers who have the command of carriages supply
themselves occasionally and their servants from the coal-pits in
the southern parts of the country; from the nearest of which the
parish is distant about twelve miles. English coal is obtained at
the shore, at the rate of from 4s. 6d. to 5s. 9d. per boll of six cwt.
according to quality; and the Scotch at about 6s. per boll of 8
cwt.  The price of the best coal at the nearest pit, which is Drum-
carro, is 1s. 10d. per load of 4 cwt.

		MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
  The improvements in husbandry and agriculture are abundantly
manifest in the district, since the date of last Account. Many wastes
have been reclaimed, marshes have been drained, nd thriving
plantations are everywhere rising up for shelter and protection.
The systems of wedge draining and subsoil ploughing are being
adopted. Turnips are extensively sown; and the practice of
eating them off with sheep, in suitable situations, is general.
The roads through the parish have also been much improved, and
are, in general, kept in excellent repair.  Many of the farm-stead-
ings are newly erected, and some of them may vie with any in the
country, either in extent of accommodation, or in neatness and ele-
gance of structure.
