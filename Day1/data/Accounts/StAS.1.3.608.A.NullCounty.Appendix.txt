   Rents.-The valued rent is 4020 l. Scotch; the real rent
about 600 l. Sterling.  All the antient servitudes are con-
verted into money.  The poor are provided with those of the
old parish.

   Ecclsiastical State.-The principal part of the inhabitants
are of the Established Church. The only Episcopals are the
family of Logie.  There are no Roman Catholics.  In the
west of Logie-Amon there is a Seceder church and manse.
The minister has a pretty good living, and rents a farm.
Most of the people of the established persuasion have seats
in the church, and, from local conveniency, attend Divine
service there; but communicate in the parish church.  It is
more than probable, that if there were a preacher or mini-
ster of the established persuasion settled among them, they
would give up the Secession.

   Rivers, Bridges, etc.-The country is intersected with se-
veral rivulets descending from the hills to the river Amon,
which, a little below their sources, form deep gullies, edged
and bottomed with rugged precipices and rocks, in all of
which there are trouts.  These gullies are greatly levelled
with high arches, for the sake of a high-way from Perth to
Crief.  The river Amon takes its rise from the top of a glen
in the Grampions, called the Narrow Glen, to the Foulis, wash-
ing Glen-Amon on the south, continuing its course between
the parishes of Methven, Regorton, and Perth, and there falls
into the Tay.  The bed and banks of this river are rocky.
In many places the water, confined between steep and high
rugged rocks, makes a tremendous appearance, and arrests
the eye with a pleasing and astonishing sublimity.  There
are 6 bridges on it.  The last bridge over it was built about
