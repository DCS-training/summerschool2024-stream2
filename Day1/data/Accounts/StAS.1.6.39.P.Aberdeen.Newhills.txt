   Stipend, Poor, etc.-The settlement for the minister, made
by Mr Davidson, was all in land, and now consists of 110 acres

acres of hill and muir ground, together with the privilege of
moss and pasturage; worth in whole L. 140 per annum.  Be-
sides this landed property, the minister receives about L. 7
