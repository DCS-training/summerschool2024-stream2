   Poor.-There is an excellent establishment of a free school
at Ballantrae, for educating the poor.  A native of the pa-
rish, about 40 or 50 years ago, left L. 400, the interest of
which sum was appointed to run on, till there was a suffi-
cient sum to build a school-house, and a dwelling-house for
the master, and from henceforward to pay the schoolmaster;
and whoever should be appointed to the office, was to be
bound to keep and leave the school and house in repair.  Ac-
cordingly a good house was built, and a large garden set off.
The patron of the parish is patron of the school; and by the
deed he is entitled to present two-thirds of the scholars, and
the kirk-session the other third.  The matter of this school
is also chosen parish schoolmaster, the salary of which is a-
bout L. 6 Sterling a year:  He is also the session clerk and
precentor for the time.  All which offices, and the perqui-
sites of them, together with the value of the house and gar-
den, makes the place worth rather more than L. 40 Ster-
ling yearly.  The consequence of this is, that there is gene-
rally a well qualified schoolmaster, who is able to teach the
languages, and the several branches of education fitting for
business.  From the nature of the school, and its situation in
a country place, the number of the scholars varies according
to the season of the year.  In summer, when many of the
poor scholars and country lads retire to herding and laborious
work, the number of scholars do not exceed 25 or 30.  In
winter there are frequently upwards of 5o attending the
school.

   Antiquities.-The only ruins within parish in the re-
mains of an old church at the north-east extremity of the
parish; it seems to have been formerly the parish church,
and deserted for the present one, as being more commodious
for the inhabitants, it is called Kirkcudbright.  And a large
