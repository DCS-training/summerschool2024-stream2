or 40 s. the half year, and a woman for 40 d. besides her harvest fee.  Now
many men servants receive L. 12 Sterling per annum, and few or none less than
L. 7; and women servnts have from L. 3 to L. 4 a year with a lippie of lint
ground, or some equivalent called bounties.  A man for the harvest demanded
formerly half a guinea, now he asks from 30 s. to 40 s, and is sometimes in-
treated to take more.  A female shearer formerly received from 8 s. to 10 s.
now 20 s and upwards.  Male servants in agriculture, besides their wages, get
victuals, or two pecks of meal a-week in lieu thereof, with milk which
they call sap.  Cottars generally receives from L. 3 to L. 7 a year, with
a house and garden, and maintenance of a cow throughout the year.  On this
scanty provision they live comfortably, and raise numerous families without
burdening the public.  A family of nine children has been reared by a labour-
er of this description without any public aid.  The cottar eats at his master's
table, or has meal in lieu of this advantage.  From 20 to 30 s a year are given
to a boy,  from 10 to 14 years of age, to tend the cattle or to drive the plough.
*A considerable part of what is called the country parish  is actually within
the royalty; and there are some houses supposed to be in town, which are
built on county land.
