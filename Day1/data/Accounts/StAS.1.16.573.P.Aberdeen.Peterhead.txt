     of Peterhead.

   In a word, a general mode of good husbandry being in-
troduced, must depend upon the proprietors of the land
giving long leases, encouragement for houses and improve-
ments, parcelling out their farms in proper lots, (for with-
out this there can be no proper rotation of crops), abolish-
ing thirlage to their mills, which is the most injudicious
tax on improvement that ever was introduced, and intro-
ducing two or three substantial farmers from the Lothians,
or Carse of Gowrie, on their own terms, who would soon
convince their neighbours by their example, of the great
improvement that may be made in this parish, as the soil
is excellent, and there is easy access to manures of every
kind.
   It must be acknowledged there are strong reasons for this
plan not having been adopted hitherto; many of the heri-
tors have but moderate incomes; they cannot afford to
lower their rents; they are ready to accept of the highest
offer; the present tenants are unwilling to relinquish the
place of their nativity, and promise a rent which is more
than they can easily pay, from the old mode of farming;
but which, by the money acquired from manufactures, and
letting out their horses, they continue to practise, and strug-
gle with poverty, and the difficulty of supporting their
credit; but there are, and have been more opulent pro-
prietors, who have seldom shown any inclination to intro-
duce some farmers capable of setting a good example, with
such encouragement as would induce and enable them to
settle in this parish.  In the neighbourhood of the town of
Peterhead, there are crops of bear from 12 to 16 bolls per
acre; eight bolls, however, is reckoned a great crop.  There
are instances of from 300 to 450 stone weight of hay (20 lb.
Dutch each stone) produced from one acre; 200 stone is
reckoned a good crop; 50 bushels of rye-grass seed are fre-
quently produced from one acre; I am likewise acquainted
