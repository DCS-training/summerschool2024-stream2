   There are two churches in the parish,-the one at Kilmichael
Inverlussay, near the manse; the other at Tayvallieh, three miles
distant by sea, and ten miles by land. The church of Kilmichael
was built in 1820, and is capable of accommodating 450 sitters;
the church of Tayvallich was built in 1827, and contains 700 sit-
ters. Both churches are kept in excellent repair. The sittings
are all free. The manse was built in 1820, and is in good repair.
The garden is very productive. It is well stocked with apple,
pear, cherry, plum, and peach trees, and with an abundance of
gooseberry and currant bushes. The glebe, which is at the dis-
tance of a mile and a half from the manse, contains about ten or
twelve acres arable land, with pasture for twelve cows, twelve
sheep, and four horses. The amount of the stipend, including
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, is 223 bolls, 1/2 peck oat-
meal, of 140 lbs. per boll, and 56.9314 imperial quarters of bear;
money stipend, L.18, 13s. 4d. The last augmentation took place
in the year 1822. The teinds are exhausted.
   Education.-There are nine schools,--three of them parochial,
and six on the teachers' own adventure. There are about 420
children in attendance upon these schools from the 12th Novem-
ber to the 1st March. The three parochial schools are this year
attended by 204, and the six side schools by 215. In the paro-
chial schools the usual branches of education are taught, includ-
ing Latin, geography, and practical mathematics; in the others,
Gaelic and English reading, writing, and arithmetic. The paro-
chial teachers have each a salary of L.17, 2s. 2d. ; but, as the
maximum salary is given and divided, tbe heritors are relieved,
according to the construction put on the Schoolmasters' Act, from
any obligation to provide schoolhouses or dwellings. The fees
for the different branches of instruction are not the same in all the
schools, but vary from 1s. 6d. to 5s. per quarter. The school fees
are seldom well paid, so that the teachers do not realize more than
L.10 each from this source. There is no child above nine years
