neighbours as he thinks necessary, to dig the proper quanti-
ty.  There are entertained with meat in abundance, spirits,
and tabacco.  The expence, on these occasion, may be about
L s. 8 d. for every man employed.  Women-servants, for the 
care of the children, and other work within doors, have L. 1
Sterling, a shirt at 3 s. and a pair or shoes at 2 or 3 s. for
thier yearly wages.  Farm women servants L. 6 Scots each,
and a pair of shoes.  A man-servant, for three quarters of
the year, has L. 9 Scots, and a pair of shoes.  No man-servant
can be got during the fishing sealon, as they have better wa-
ges at the fishing.

   Antiquities-There are three Pictish castles in this parish,
one at Burravock, one at Brough, and another at burranels.
These are all of a circular form, and have no entrance but
from the top.  They are built to stones of such a sizes as
could not have been railed without the use of engines which 
could hardly have been supported to be in use at the rude pe-
riod in which these buildings must have been erected.  There
are, in different parts of the country, Pictish castles more
entire than those in this parish.  No tradition, or historical
account, can now be had; owing, perhaps, in a great mea-
sure, to this circumstance, that very few of the descendants
from the original inhabitants now remain.  When these
islands were transferred from Denmark to Scotland, many
from Scotlands came over in different lines.  By dint of su-
perior wealth, superior wisdom, or some other means, ma-
ny of them acquired estates, by buying out the Norvegian
proprietors, whose prossessions in general were small, owing to 
a regulation they had, of divising their lands equally among
thier children.  This regulation had rendered the possessions
of each individual very trifting in many instances.
