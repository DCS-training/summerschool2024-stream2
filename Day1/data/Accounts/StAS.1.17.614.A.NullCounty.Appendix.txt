side of the water above the Steel, and not far from the Har-
bour Craig.  The first is very old, and only the foundation
of the last is to be discovered, a little to the east of the pre-
sent one, seen from the lake.  The verses are entitled, A
Morning Walk at New Hall in Mid-Lothian, the seat of Ro-
bert Brown, Esq; Advocate.

Waked by the morning rays from sleeting dreams,
I leave the couch inviting to repose,
To trace the scenes which nature spreads around;
To please the eye or animate the soul,
With recollections drawn from ancient times.-
We enter first the glen adorned with trees,
Where varied shades and pleasing groves delight
The warbling birds that perch on every spray.
The lulling murmurs of the distant Esf,
At bottom of the woods salutes the ear;
Beyond, the rising heights covered with woods,
And interspersed with jutting rocks, invite
The eye to trace, in beauty's waving line,
The vivid landscape, rich with deepening shades
Which here o'erhang the glassy glittering stream,
Till from the widening vale the country op's.-
The winding path now leads us thro' the wood,
Where Esq pours forth her silver flowing stream
In sweet retirement, and sequestered shade.
We then approach the opening of the trees
Where now the rustie swain enjoys the banks,
Happy and blythe, not far his humble Cot,
Cloathed with the shining straw, whose: white-washed walls
Appear contrasted with the ivy's green.
Before the door the partner of his cares
Turns swift the wheel, and tunes the scottish song,
