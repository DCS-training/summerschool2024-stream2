	The corporation of the city are proprietors of the Established
churches, and receive the seat rents. That the church is not bur-
densome to the sommunity is evident from the following official
statement for 1834, by which it appears that the  ecclesiastical re-
venue exceeded the expenditure, L.487, 1s.7d. as under:

	Individuals inimical to establishments think that the interest of
the sums laid out in building the churches should form a part of
the expense of the Establishment. Without admitting the prin-
ciple that parochial churches should support themselves; on the
contrary, believing that the law and the practice is otherwise, it may
be well to see how the churches in Glasgow came into the possession
of the corporation. In the first place, the Cathedral and Outer
High Churches belong to the Crown, the corporation being at the
expense of seating them. The College Church was given to the cor-
poration by Queen Mary; and on its becoming ruinous, it was re-
built of the seats belong to the College or to private individuals.
The Ramshorn Church in like manner was built chiefly by sub-
scription. It has lately been rebuilt, under the name of St David's,
at the expense of the corporation. This church, and its beautiful
tower, after deducting the amount of sales of burying places in the
crypt, cost the corporation little more th`n L. 3000. St Enoch's
Church, originally intended for a chapel of ease, was built chielfy
by subscription, but was soon afterwards acquired by the corpora-
tion for a parish church. It has lately been rebuilt on very favour-
able terms; as the corporation, after receiving interest for the sum
laid out, gained L. 132, 17s. 6d. per annum, as appeared from a
printed paper which Dr Cleland addressed to the corporation when
the church was finished. This saving arose chiefly from addaitional
seats and better accommodation.
	The collections at the doors at the Established churches ave-
rage rather more thatn L.1800 per annum, which, when added to

<FOOTNOTE>By Act 48 Geo. III. 6, C. 138, no stipend can be augmented until twenty years
after the date of the last decreet of modification. The incumbents of the Cathedral
and Barony Churches were entitled to apply for an augmentation on 22d February
1835.
