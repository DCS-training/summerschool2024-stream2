by 14 or 16 at the bottom.  And the lowest and remaining
part of it, is 28 by 16 or 18.  Of course, the whole cut is
of a regular form, sloping gradually on each side, and happi-
ly proportioned to the quantity of water it is meant to dis-
charge.
   The expence of the whole was not above L. 600 sterling;
a sum which is indeed very inconsiderable, when compared
with the advantages of the work.  The same contractor un-
dertook both parts of the cut, but at different prices.  The
first part he engaged to cut for 2 d a cubic yard.  But in
that case, he was not bound to form the banks into a regular
sloping ridge, but only to lay down the earth regularly, at
least a yard distant from the edge of the cut.  And it was
understood, that each tenant or proprietor, would at his
leisure, and at very small expence, form it into a regular
bank.  As this was neglected by many, it was therefore
judged most adviseable, to contract not only for cutting the
remaining part, but for forming the banks.  Of course, 2 d 1/4
the cubic yard was offered, and accepted: and as the
whole course was either a fine rich solid mould, from two to
three feet deep, or a stiff clay mixed with moss, it was sound
to be a reasonable allowance.  The bank on either side is
three feet from the edge of the cut, and for the most part
upwards of three feet high.  And as they slope equally both
ways like a ridge, they may be ploughed at pleasure, or
sown with grass-seeds.  If at any future period it should be
necessary, they may easily be raised a foot or two feet higher
at the summit; leaving a water course, of from 30 to 40 feet
wide, from bank to bank, so as to contain double the quan-
tity of water.  For one foot at top would nearly contain as
much as four at bottom.
   It may be worthy of observation, that as soon as the work
was contracted for, numbers from England and Ireland, as
