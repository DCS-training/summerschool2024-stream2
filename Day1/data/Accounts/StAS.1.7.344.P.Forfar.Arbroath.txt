yearly tax, payable out of every rood of land lying within
the burgh.  The pier was built of wood, and but ill con-
structed to defend the vessels in stormy weather, from the
heavy surges which roll on shore.  In the year 1725, a brief
was obtained for building a new one, which is situated a little
to the west of the old.  It is strongly built of stone all round,
small, but very commodious, and so constructed that a vessel
can lie to at any part of it, either to receive or discharge her
cargo.  It is likewise perfectly safe, being contracted at the
entrance to the width of 31 feet, and defended by what is
called the gates, which are 14 or 15 strong beams of wood,
let down in a groove on each side, and locked in on the top
by iron bars.  These beams, which are easily put in or taken
out in 15 minutes, by means of a crane made for the purpose,
completely break the force of the sea, which runs into the
harbour, so that it is fida statio carinis.  It is always dry at low
water; but has a fluice on the north side, by which the water
of Brothock is admitted, when it is thought necessary to clean
it.  At spring tides there is, at its entrance, a depth of 15 or
16 feet; and at neep tides, of 9 or 10 feet water.
   In the year 1781, there belonged to this harbour no more
than 17 or 18 vessels, making all together only about 900
tons; now there are 32 vessels, making 1704 tons, which
employ about 160 seamen.  There are besides two vessels on
the stocks, together above 150 tons.
   To this harbour belong also 3 fishing boats, besides the pi-
lot boats, which employ 14 fishermen; but these depend
upon a living more on what they make, by pilotage, than on
what they can earn in the fishing trade, which has mostly
failed*.

Fearnought of Dunkirk, commanded by one Fall.  On the
