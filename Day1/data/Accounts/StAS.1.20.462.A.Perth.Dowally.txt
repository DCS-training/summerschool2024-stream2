meeting with planting, he finds natural woods every where
skirting the road, which runs along the declivity.  Below
the road, several level haughs run out in different places, to
fill up the meanders of the river; and above it, lie some
gently sloping fields, which reach nearly to the summit of
the hill.  The declivity of the hill is frequently seamed by
pretty deep ravines.  Bridges are thrown across them.  Of
these, there are 27 within the length of the parish of Dow-
ally.  So rapid is the ascent of the declivity, that, in some
cases, while the wall of one side of the bridge is not 3 feet
above the surface, the wall of the other is above 30.
   The soil of the haughs is light and sandy; that of the
higher fields, upon the brow of the hill, is deeper and
stronger, with a slight mixture of clay.  The hill is compo-
sed of schistus intermixed with pyrites, and contains some
scattered grains of copper ore.

   Numbers and Age.-By a very accurate list of the inha-
bitants, taken in 1790, it appeared that they were in num-
ber, and of age, as follows:

*In the Statistical Account of Dunkeld it is said, that the population
in 1755 amounted to 1298; but this number included the population also
of Dowally, at that period.  At present, the population of the united pa-
rishes in 1773.  There is an excess therefore of 475 beyond the population
of 1755.
