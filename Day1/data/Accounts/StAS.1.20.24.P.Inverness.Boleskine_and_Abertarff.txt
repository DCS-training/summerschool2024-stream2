prejudices gave way to ideas, more suitable to an improved
state of society.-This country is naturally divided by ri-
vers, hills, and moons, into a variety of sections, and each of
these admitting of some agricultural cultivation, have been
computed by the inhabitants into davochs, half davochs, or
plough-lands, being the fourth part of a davoch, according
to their extent; each half davoch-land was again subdivided
into eight parts, commonly called aughten-parts, and agree-

whole cattle, man, woman, and child; and it was no un-

this ambulatory course during the seasons of vegetation; and
the only operations attended to during the summer season
