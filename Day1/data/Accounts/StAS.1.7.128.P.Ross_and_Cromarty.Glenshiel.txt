     Statistical Account

the sowing is seldom over before the end of May; and, in
some seasons, the harvest is not in before the end of October.
   This country is but little adapted for the purposes of agri-
culture; there are some farms which will not raise as much
corn as will be sufficient for the consumption of the occupi-
ers for one fourth of the year.  The height of the parish is
believed to be much calculated for rearing sheep; and, in
the year 1786, triple rent was offered for that district by
sheep-farmers, (it being then out of lease), which the pro-
prietor absolutely refused, declaring, that he would never
prefer sheep to men, at the same time that he set the lands to
the old inhabitants (who are not over fond of sheep) on their
paying a pretty moderate augmentation.
   The staple production of the parish is black cattle.  These
are not large, but hardy, and uncommonly elegant in shape.
The price of a full grown cow is from 3 l. to 5 l.   They are
generally bought at Whitsunday and Michaelmas, by persons
from Ayr and Perth shires, who sell them to the English
drovers.  The horses are, like the black cattle, of small size,
but strong and well formed, and generally sell at between 4 l.
and 6 l.
   All the sheep are of the small kind.  Their flesh is sweet
and delicate, and their wool middling fine.  A sheep and
lamb, with year old fleece, will fetch in May from between
5 s. to 6 s.
   Goats are reared in the height of the parish.  Their flesh
and milk are believed to be of a medicinal quality, and to
contribute not a little to prevent and remove many com-
plaints, particularly those of a consumptive kind.  The price
of a goat is from 5 s. to 7 s.
