and they consider school wages as a debt of honour, which they
would pay, thought hey had nothing left or though other debts should
not be discharged. I must, however, admit that these honourable
feelings were more general thirty years ago than they are now.
The habit of receiving assistance diminishes exertion; and the
habit of receiving charity destroys the spirit of independence.
	Poor.--The number of poor in this parish is not great, vary-
ing perhaps from 15 to 20; but not more than a half of these are
supported entirely from the church funds. Some of them receive
from 5s. to 10s. per quarter; and their other wants are supplied
by their own industry, or the aid and assistance of their relatives,
and the private charity of their neighbours. But though the
number of poor is not great, and the allowance for their support
very little, yet the demand upon the poor funds exceeds the sup-
ply, and requires to be eked out by a voluntary contribution of
L. 13 per annum from the heritors. This is rendered necessary
at present by having on our list two helpless idiots, and an indi-
vidual who was born without either legs or arms, now about twenty-
two years of age, and in perfect health. In such extraordinary
cases as these we have recourse to the heritors. The collections
at the church on Sundays may amount to L. 20 or L. 25 yearly;
interest of money belonging to the funds to about L. 6; and fines,
proclamations, and mortcloth-money may come to L. 6 or L. 8
more. This is the whole of our revenue, which cannot afford
much to every one,--and, indeed, would be no very extravagant
aliment for a single individual; and yet these poor people are con-
tented and wonderfully happy. But still the tendency of pau-
perism here, as almost everywhere else, is to increase. The poor
list has been nearly doubled since I came to this parish in 1813;
and the collections more than doubled.
