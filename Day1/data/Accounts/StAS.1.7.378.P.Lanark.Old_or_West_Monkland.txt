     Statistical Account

this parish for 9 or 10 miles, there is a strong clay.  Here are
produced luxuriant crops of every grain, especially of wheat;
sometimes from 12 to 16 bolls are taken off an acre.  The
middle of the parish is a light sand, affording excellent crops
of oats and potatoes.  A farmer sells an acre undigged at
from 13 L. to 17 L. Sterling.  Towards the north are consi-
derable tracks of moss.  The rivers above named abound
with salmon in the proper season, and trout of every species.
There is also plenty of pike and perch in the Monkland
Canal, and in the great lochs on the north side of the
parish; the taking of which, from small boats made for the
purpose, is a pleasant amusement.-The improvements of
agriculture are carried on to a vast extent.  Several plowing-
matches have been instituted:  These create a spirit of emu-
lation, and a desire to excel.  The farmers are uncommonly
intelligent.  They have formed themselves into a society,
which meets on the first Thursday of every month.  Their
object is to communicate their knowledge, and purchase the
most proper books relating to their business.  In the parish
are several threshing-mills, which have been found of great
use.  The plough commonly used is an improvement of the
old Scotch one.  Small's would not close the stiff lee of this
parish.  The beam is 6 feet; the stilt 6 feet 3 inches.  It
turns the steepest ground; and, being very light, 3 horses
will perform as much work with it as 4 with the old one.-A
considerable disadvantage under which the farmers labour, is
the distance from lime; but this will, it is hoped, soon be
removed, at least in some degree; as, after the junction of
the two canals, lime may be brought from the north by wa-
ter carriage, and as there is a bridge to be erected over the
Clyde, on the south.  The ordinary rotation of crops is this:
From lee sometimes oats, sometimes peas; then summer fal-
low and wheat; then pease and beans; and then oats and
