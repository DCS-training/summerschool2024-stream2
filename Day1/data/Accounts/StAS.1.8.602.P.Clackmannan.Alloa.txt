darg (or day's work), for every acre, or 10 d. per annum.  All
multures are abolished.

   Shaw Park.-On the N. E. extremity of the parish,
stands SHAW PARK, the seat of LORD CATHCART.  The house
and offices take up a pretty large space.  The grounds about
it are delightfully varied, and set off the large plantations to
great advantage.  The late Lord bestowed a very large sum
of money, on it and the house; which stands high, as the

heightened and repaired a few years ago, is faced with rough

dam is full, it covers 128 Scotch acres of ground, nearly

which first drives a mill, originally erected for grinding snuff,
but now better employed in chipping and grinding wood and

just before the water is conveyed into pipes for forcing it up
to the engine, for raising the water out of the coal pits, and to
another for drawing up the coals.  Having performed these
