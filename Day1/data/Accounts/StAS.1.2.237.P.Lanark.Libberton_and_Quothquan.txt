the session records, that there is an annual, and gradual decrease
of the births and marriages, from 1753, down to the present
time.  The annual average of births, from 1683, to 1753, is
31 1/2; so that the number of souls in this parish, at that time,
could not be less than 1400.  For it must here be observed,
that the rule laid down of multiplying the number of births by
26, the number of deaths by 36, in order to ascertain the po-
pulation of any country, is , in  several instances, very fallaci-
ous.  The annual average of births in this parish, for these 7
years, is 17 1/2, which, multiplied by 26, would make the inha-
bitants amount to little more than 450.  The annual average
of deaths, during the same period, was 14, which, multipli-
ed by 36, would make them amount to 604.  Whereas, accord-
ing to the list, which the incumbent took of them, in the course
of his first visitation of the parish, they amounted to 790.
And, according to that, which he took with great care, about
3 months ago, they amounted to 758.
   The births from January, 1765, to Januarry, 1775, amoun-
ted to 223; the annual average of which, is about 22.  From
1775, to 1785, they amounted to 200; the annual average
of which, is exactly 20.  From 1785, to 1790, they amoun-
ted to 89; the annual average of which, is about 17 1\2.  From
these facts, taken from the session records, it appears, that the
population of this parish is materially different, from what it
was, 5, 10, and 25 years ago.

   This depopulation may be attributed to the following cau-
ses: 1st, To the non-residence of gentlemen on their estates.
When landed proprietors reside on their estates, there must be
a number of servants, dependants, and workmen of different
kinds.  Houses would then be built, and marriages take place.
Now there are 9 heritors in this parish, none of whom reside
in it, except two small ones, of L. 30 a year.  Whereas, in
former times, 6 considerable families had their constant resi-
