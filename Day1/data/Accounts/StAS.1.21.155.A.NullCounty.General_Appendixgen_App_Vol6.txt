al position; and from impressions still visible, it is evident
they have been cut with an axe or some similar instrument.
For the cutting of wood, the two common purposes are, ei-
ther to apply it to its proper use, or that the ground it occu-
ples may be cultivated.  In the present case, however, nei-
ther of these ends had been proposed, since the trees, by be-
ing left just as they were cut, were not only entirely lost, but
the ground was rendered totally unfit for cultivation.  Hence
it is evident, that the downfal of this wood must be ascribed
to some more extraordinary cause; and to none more proba-
bly than to that expedient, which, as we learn from Dion
Cassius and other historians, the Romans put so extensively
in practice, to dislodge from their forests the antient inhabi-
tants of the British islands,
   This hypothesis acquires no small degree of force from a
circumstance that occurred in May 1768, when a large round
vessel of thin brass and curious workmanship, 25 inches in
diameter and 16 inches in height, was discovered upon the
surface of the clay buried under the moss.  This vessel, found
upon the estate of John Ramsay, Esq.  of Ochtertyre, was by
that gentleman presented to the Antiquarian Society of Edin-
burgh; in whose museum it remains deposited for preserva-
tion.  And in a list of the various donations presented to that
society, published by them in 1782, it is there denominated
a 'Roman camp kettle.'
   Between the clay and the moss is found a stratum 9 inches
thick, partly dark brown, and partly of a colour approaching
to black.  This is a vegetable mould, accumulated probably
by the plants that covered the ground previous to the growth
of the wood, and by leaves from the trees thereafter.  The
difference of colour must be owing to a difference in the ve-
getable substances that compose it.  The brown mould is
highly fertile; the other, especially in a dry season, is very
