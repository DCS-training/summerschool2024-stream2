   Population.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
population in 1755 was 531.  The number of inhabitants
in this parish has within these 50 years considerably di-
minished.  At that time, the number amounted to 500
examinable persons.  Last year (1792) an exact enume-
ration of the inhabitants, of all ages, was made, when they
amounted to 495; 270 of whom were males, and 225 fe-
males.  About 450 of the inhabitants live in the country
part of the parish, and the rest in a village, which is in its
infant state.  It is built on the river Fleet, opposite to
Gatehouse, and being connected with it by a bridge it is
considered as part of the same village.  The inhabitants in
the village are mostly employed in manufacturing cotton,
which a few months ago was carried on with spirit and
success, but like many other branches of trade, it is now
almost given up.  The decrease of the inhabitants is caused
partly by some of the proprietors taking farms into their
natural possession to improve them, and conjoining several
in one when again let, and partly to the vicinity of the
parish to the village of Gatehouse, to which many of them
have removed, where those who formerly were common
labourers, commence spinning cotton, and tradesmen fol-

of marriages from 1750 to 1760 to be 4, and that of births
12; for a long time thereafter the registration seems to be
discontinued.  The annual average of births during these
3 last years has been 10, and that of marriages 1.  There
are 9 proprietors belonging to the parish, 2 of whom con-
stantly reside in it, and 1 occationally.  By far the greater
