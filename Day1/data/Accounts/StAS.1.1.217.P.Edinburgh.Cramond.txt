this district, one or other of the following systems is, how-
ever, usually adopted: 1st years, summer-fallow, or hay and
rag saugh; 2 d; wheat; 3d, oats; 4th, beans and pease; 5th,

   Manure-The principal manure is stable and street dung
from Edinburgh and Leith, of which about 10,000 cart
loads are annually brought into this district, that, one with
another, cost about 1 s. prime cost, and 1 s. 6 d. for car-
riage, making a total expence of L. 1250, and much the
same quantity of stable dung, etc. may be made within the
parish.  The long continued use of the town dung has filled
the soil full of every kind of annual weeds, in particular,
bird-feed or wild mustard, called here scaldricks, of which
the fields are in one continued blow in the early part of
summer.  Sometimes lime is used from Burdyhouse or Gil-
merton, of which 40 to 80 bolls of shells are laid on each
acre, and cost 1 s. 4 d. per boll.  Marle was discovered some
years ago, on the farms of Marchfield and Craigcrook,
where a considerable quantity was procured; but the work-
ing it becoming very expensive, is now discontinued, and the
pits are drowned.

   Implements of Husbandry.-Small's chain plough, drawn by
two horses, is generally used, which is much preferable to
the old Scots ploughs, that required four horses and a dri-
ver.  Harrows are generally of the old kind, with 4 bulls and
20 iron teeth, improved by slots instead of rungs; there are
also some of Lord Kame's harrows used here.  Dung carts
hold above 29 cubic feet, are mounted on stout narrow
wheels 4 1/2 feet diameter, with iron axles, weigh about 5 cwt.
altogether, and usually carry 16 cwt, two horses being
