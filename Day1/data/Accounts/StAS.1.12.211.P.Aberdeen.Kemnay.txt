tion are Miltown, Alehousewell, Glenhead, Srapehard, etc.;
of the latter are Craigearn, or Iron Stone, Lachintillie, or
the Hillock of Sawins, etc.  All these names are evidently
expressive of the particular situation of the respective places,
excepting Lachintillie, which very probably has been origi-
nally a nickname.

   Roads.-There are only two public roads in this parish,
the one leading to Aberdeen, the other to Inverury and Old
Meldrum.  They were originally made, and are kept in re-
pair by the statute-labour.

   Wages, Prices, etc.-Very little of the farm work is done
by cottages; the farmers, in general, employing unmarried
men servants, who eat and lodge in their master's houses.
Their wages are from 5 L. to 7 L. yearly; by far too high for
the present state of agriculture in Aberdeenshire.  Last sea-
son, 1 s. a-day, besides victuals and lodging, was given to
men for harvest work; and we heard of 2 L. 10 s. having 
been given as wages for the harvest, by lump, at no great
distance from this district.  This exorbitant price of farm-
work is owing, as I had occasion to hint before, to the great
and increasing demand for hands at the Aberdeen manufac-
tories*.

Andrew, he brought with him an effort of royal genius, that deserves to be
mentioned as curiosity.  It is a painting done by the father of the late King
of Prussia, a fit of the gout.  It is now at Kemnay, and is a performance
much suited to procure entire credit to the inscription at the foot of it; "Fre-
