instance, the proprietors of the Highland part of the parish, or
their factors report to me, that there are 700 acres in that district
which might be profitably added to the arable soil, and if it were
allowed, which may very fairly be done, that there are 1000 acres
of the arable soil, the fertility of which might at least be doubled
by being subjected to a proper rystem of drainage, it must be evi-
dent that avast increase may be made to the agricultural produce
of the parish ; and although the existing rental with the present
prices might not be raised, yet it could be easily maintained, With-
out impoverishing the cultivators of the soil.
   It is not so easy to say what means ought to be adopted to in-
crease the moral and religious advantages of the people.  Our
hearts, alas! are more cold, ungrateful, and intractable than our
soil.  A bridge over the Ericht would make the parish church
more accessible to a considerable portion of the parishioners.
Above all, would it be advantageous to a large district of the pa-
rish, were the chapel at Persie endowed, its preacher ordained,
and some salary attached to the school at Strone of Cally? At-
tempts have been made to attain each of these objects, but they
have hitherto failed, and in these uneasy times there is little hope
of their speedy accomplishment.  The people attending the cha-
pel of Persie have the election of the preacher; they have the ex-
clusive, management of the affairs of the chapel ; but this  is not
freedom enough for them, and some, of them, deserting the minis-
try of a most faithful and assiduous servant in the Lord's Vine,
yard, have joined themselves to the "Free Church."
