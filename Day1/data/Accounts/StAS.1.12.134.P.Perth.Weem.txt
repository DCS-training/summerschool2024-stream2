between 3 and 4 stones the peck of scutched flax.  The whole
of this flax is dressed in water mills, which are erected in
different parts of the country.  The owner of the lint pays
1 s. 4 d. the stone, for dressing it at the mill.  The whole of
the flax, except what is necessary for linen for the people
themselves, is spun into yarn of 4, 5, or 6 hanks from the
pound weight, and sold in that state to manufacturers in 
Perth and Glasgow.  There is a good deal of lime used for
manure; and were it not for the scarcity and expense of fuel
to burn it, there would be much more used, as the limestone
is in great plenty in most places of this country; and as it is
invariably found to succeed wherever it can be procured.

have been built in most places within the last 30 years.  Be-
fore that period, the whole might, for the greatest part of 
the year, be considered as a common; but now in most
places, marches are strictly observed to the very tops of the
mountains.

   Animals.-Quadrupeds of the wild kind, are, a few red
deer, roes, foxes, hares, wild cats, martins, otters, badgers,
polecats, weasels, ermines, and moles.  The foxes, before
the year 1760, made great havock among the sheep, goats,
etc.; but from that time, regular fox-hunters have been em-
ployed at fixed salaries, by whole diligence and skill vast num-
bers of foxes have been destroyed; so that their number is
