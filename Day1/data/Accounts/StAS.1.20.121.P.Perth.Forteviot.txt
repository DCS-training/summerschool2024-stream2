of Scotland, as some late writers in defence of Gothicism
groundlessly fancy it to be.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants is 970.  When
this account was taken, about two years ago, the number of
males in the parish was less than that of females only by
three.  In 1755, according to Dr Webster's account, the
population was 1164, which makes a deficiency of 194.
The accumulation of small into large farms is generally ascri-

Abbey of CAmbuskenneth, and was afterwards given to the
College of St Andrews; which college, and the family of
Belches of Invermay, are patrons.  The ancient parish of Muck-
arsey was, many years go, annexed to Forteviot.  There is
a place of worship at Muckarsey, and the ruins of another at
Kirktown of Mailler, neither of which has for a long time
been frequented; but the burying-grounds adjoining to
them are occupied by the neighbourhood for burying their
dead.-The Reverend Harry Inglis is the present incum-
bent, and enjoys a stipend above L. 100 Sterling, besides
manse and glebe.  He has long served in the pastoral charge
of this parish with great respectability and success.  Of

under the necessity of keeping an assistant, of which he has
had several in succession.  The custom that prevails in Scot-

ant, when the minister becomes unfit for the whole or a
part of the duty, is highly commendable.  These assist-
