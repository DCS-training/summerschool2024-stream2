     Statistical Account

in this parish, and to there being no high mountains, nor any
large tracks of wood to prevent the free circulation of the
air.  The inhabitants are healthy, and subject to no diseases,
but such as are peculiar to their neighbours*.  The nature
of the cultivated soil is various; that along the sea coast is
thin and stony, but, when properly cultivated, yields good
crops of grass and corn, especially if the summer months be
moist and rainy; that in the middle of the parish is deep, rich,
and having a clay bottom, produces luxuriant crops on such
farms as are kept in a good state of culture: as it extends to-
ward the Mulbury, (a long track of common, extending from
Cromarty to the public road leading from Beauly to Ding-
wall, and covering a considerable part of this parish to the N.)
the soil, though good, from its high situation is cold; and
though it yields tolerable crops of coats and pease, the barley
crops are generally poor, owing, in a great measure, to the
wetness of the ground, and no drains nor fences being made to
carry off the hill-waters, on shelter the fields, excepting on the
heritor's mains, as also from the people's not giving it a suf-
ficient quantity of good and rich manure.  This parish, not-
withstanding, yields a much greater quantity of grain than is
sufficient to support the inhabitants; and from the grain's be-
ing always early sown, and as early gathered in at harvest,
it is found to be of a superior quality for the brewer, the dis-
tiller, and mealmonger, and being in the close neighbourhood

*The small-pox generally makes dreadful havocks among the children; and
this is in a great measure owing to the aversion the common people have at ino-
culation, which, I am told, has never been practised here, but by the gentle-
men, and such of their dependents are have been prevailed upon, by earnest per-
suasion and entreaty, to permit their children to be inoculated; however, it is
to be expected, that as the people become a little more acquainted with this
happy mean, which has already saved the lives of thousands, and see its salutary
effects, that they may be brought to yield to the practice of it, and so save the
lives of their own young ones.
