landlick word heild, signifying fire; Konger's-know, a tu-
mulus near the road leading to the King's-ferry.  But from
what circumstance the Mainland came to be honoured
with the name of Pomona, is difficult now to account for;
unless its origin be ascribed to an opinion which prevailed
among the ancients, that Thule was a terrestrial paradise,
resembling the garden of the Hesperides.  Orkney may
have received its name from the Saxons, its ancient inha-
bitants, who had emigrated from the Hercynian forest,

   The ancient proprietors of this parish were the Halcros,
the Sinclairs, and the Stewarts.  The only considerable
proprietor at present is William Honyman, Efq; of Graem-
fay, a gentleman possessed of the largest property in this
county, next to Lord Dundas, and lineally descended from
Andrew Honyman, Bishop of Orkney, whom he has the
honour to represent.  Keith, in his Catalogue of the Bi-
shops, p. 136, tells us, that Andrew Honyman, Archdeacon
of St Andrews, author of the Seasonable Cafe and Survey
of Naphtali, succeeded Bishop Sydserf, anno 1664, to the
fee of Orkney, in the month of July 1668.  This prelate
received, on the street of Edinburgh, by one Mitchell, who
had been at the rising into rebellion at Pentland Hills, a shot
in his arm, with a poisoned bullet, as he was steping into
the Archbishop of St Andrew's (Dr Sharp) coach, for
whom the shot was intended.  He found his health much
impaired after this disaster.  He died in February 1676,
and was buried in the Cathedral Church of Kirkwall.  He
was a man of singular piety, and great abilities.
