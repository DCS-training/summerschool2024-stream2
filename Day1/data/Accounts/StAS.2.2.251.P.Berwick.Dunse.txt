went to prosecute his studies at Merton College, in the University
of Oxford, where he acquired a fellowship, and was advanced in
1301 to the University Professorship of Theology. By command
of the general of his Order, he went to Paris in 1304 to defend his
doctrine of the immaculate conception; which he did with great
applause. He was sent on the same mission to Cologne in 1308,
where he died on the 8th of November in the same year. His
works are collected into twelve bulky folios, of which the most per-
fect edition was printed at Lyons in 1629. Long after his decease
the disputes of the Scotists and Thomists continued to disturb the
peace of the Christian church, and to exercise the perverted inge-
nuity of churchmen.
   This parish has also produced men distinguished by their piety,
and by their scientific, literary, and moral attainments. Among
these, as elsewhere noticed, the Rev. Thomas Boston, the author
of the Fourfold State and Sermons, was born at Dunse in 1676,
and died at Etterick in 1732.
   Abraham Robertson, LL. D., Savilian Professor of Astronomy
at Oxford, who also presided at the Board of Longitude, was born
in 1751, of parents in a humble condition of life in the town of
Duns; and, after arriving by the diligent application of his talents
at high distinction in mathematical science, died at Oxford in 1826,
as much distinguished by his unaffected modesty and other moral
qualities as by his scientific attainments.
   The Rev. Thomas M'Crie, D. D., author of the life of John Knox,
and other admirable historical works, was born at Dunse in 1773.
   This parish was also the birth-place of the Rev. James Gray,
formerly one of the Masters of the High School of Edinburgh,
and afterwards admitted to holy orders in the Church of England.
He was appointed to perform the duties of his office at Cutch, in
the East Indies, and at the same time to direct the education of the
prince of that country; but was cut off in 1830, while zealously em-
ployed in translating the Holy Scriptures into the Cutchee and
Hindostance, and composing the first grammar and dictionary which
had ever been attempted of the Cutch language.
