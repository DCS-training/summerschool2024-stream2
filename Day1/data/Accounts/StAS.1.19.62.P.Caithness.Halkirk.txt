     Statistical Account

gin of several customs, which have prevailed for a long
time afterwards, and some of which do still prevail, is to
be traced to that period.  From this intermixture spring
many words in their language, especially words expressive
of the names of persons, of places, of vessels, and various
utensils and instruments, etc.  But a very considerable
part of this intermixture being Danes and Norwegians, as
these were, by all accounts, superior in power and posses-
sion, so their language and usages would be the most pre-
valent also; and among the other effects of this prevalence,
were the names which were given to places, many of which
are manifestly of Danish origin.  This circumstance, toge-
ther with the variations they have necessarily undergone
in the different stages of time since that period, render it
almost impossible to ascertain, or trace out their real mean-
ing at this distance of time.
   At present there are two languages spoken in this parish,
viz. the Earse and the English.  The former is much cor-
rupted, but yet spoken with great fluency and emphasis,
and not without harmony of sound.  The latter has also
many words, which are neither English nor Scotch, yet, ac-
cording to its idiom, it is spoken with great propriety, and
the sentiments are expressed by it, either in narration or
description, as intelligibly and significantly, as in any coun-
ty in Great Britain, nay, I dare say, more so than in most of
them.  These languages are spoken in various degrees.
Some speak only the Earse, but do not speak or understand
the English; some understand the English, but do not
speak it; some speak the English, but do not speak or un-
derstand the Earse; some understand the Earse, but do not
speak it; but the greatest number speak and understand
both these languages equally well.  This is their state with
regard to language; but of late years, the English is ma-
king great progress at the expence of the Earse.
