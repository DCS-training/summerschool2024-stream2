"ewe bughts;" and a scene as rich as truly pastoral and sub-
lime, is frequently presented to the eye, as ever was painted
by Claude le Lorrain, or Thomson could describe.  From
these circumstamces, the manners, ideas, employments, lan-.
guage and dress of the old inhabitants; the title of the for-

nature only we can acquire those impressions to be conveyed
to the reader, in a striking description; and a poet, to excel in
that branch of his art, must be alive to the charms of a good
landscape; must collect from nature alone such objects as
suit his purpose, in those places where the greatest number
of them are to be met with; and in their distribution and co-
