     Statistical Account

70 years ago, having resided in his younger years in the
high country, I suspected the deer might have been sent to
him; his widow, however, who is still alive, assured me a
few weeks ago there was no such animal sent during
his residenee here.  There is no doubt, at a very di-
stant period, there were large woods in this parish, as
roots of trees are found every day in the mosses.  It is
very extraordinary, if it should have remained entire for so
long a time; and it is not easily to be explained, how an
entire skeleton should have been found, unless these animals
once resided here.
   A pretty large piece of amber was lately found on the
sea-beach, a little below the manse, and is at present in my
custody.  This probably has floated hither from the Baltic,
where amber was found in the days of Tacitus, and is still
to be got in considerable quantities.  Camden mentions a
piece of amber being found at the Buchanness in this parish,
of so extraordinary a size as almost to stagger belief.

   Mines and Quarries.-The hills on the S. and S. W.
parts of the parish, if they deserve that name, are covered
with heath; there are no volcanic appearances in the parish,
petrified parts of animals, or petrifying springs or waters;
there are no coal-mines, lime, or slate quarries, but inex-
haustible quarries of excellent granite, of which all the
houses in the town of Peterhead are built, and great quan-
tities exported to the London market, and for different
parts in England; the granite admits of the finest polish,
and lapidaries are frequently employed in forming it into
various shapes for different pieces of furniture.  There
are some crystals found lodged in rocks of granite.  Fossil
shells are found in great quantities 20 or 30 feet above the
present level of the sea; and it is remarkable that some of
them are of a larger size than any that are now to be found
