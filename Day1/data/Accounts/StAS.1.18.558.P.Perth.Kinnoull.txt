     Statistical Account

"after a polite reception of the King, by the lady, who had
"lost her sight by old age, she was seated next to his Majesty,
"and gave him the history of Wallace and Robert Bruce;
"and told him, that she had seen them both, who were not
"only handsome, but very strong; and that Wallace exceed-
"ed Robert Bruce in fortitude.  The King departed to Perth
"well pleased with the entertainment given him by the lady."
It is to this story, that Adamson refers, in these lines of
(Book vi.) of his Muses Threnodie, printed at Edinburgh 1638.

     "Within this place, a lady did remaine,
     "Of great experience, who likewise knew
     "By spirit of prophecy, what should ensue;
     "Who saw Wight Wallace, and brave Bruce on live,
     "And both their manhoods lively did descrive
     "Unto that noble Prince, first of that name,
     "Worthy King James, who hearing of her fame,
     "Went to her house, these histories to learn,
     "When as for age, her eyes could scarce discerne.
     "This lady did foretell of many things,
     "Of Britain's Union, under Scottish Kings.
     "And after ending of our civill feeds,
     "Our spears in syths; our swords should turn in speads.
     "In signe whereof there should arise a Knight,
     "Sprung from the bloody yoak, who should of right
     "Possess these lands, which she then held in fee,
     "Who for his worth, and matchless loyaltie
     "Unto his Prince, should greatly be renown'd,
     "And of these lands instyled, and Earle be crowned;
     "Whose Son, in spight of Tay, should joine these lands
     "Firmly by stone, on either side which stands."

   The last lines, have of late been very naturally applied to
the late Earl of Kinnoul, to whom we are chiefly indebted for
the bridge of Perth; and whose lands are on both sides of
the river.
