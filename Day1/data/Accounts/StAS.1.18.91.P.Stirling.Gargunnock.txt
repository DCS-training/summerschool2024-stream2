which an English party was stationed, to watch the passage
of the Frew, in its neighbourhood.  Wallace with a few
followers, took the fort by stratagem in the night, while
the English were off their guard.  The curious stranger may
be conducted to the ground which it once occupied; and
may perhaps regret, that scarcely a stone is now left to tell
its story.  There is something so venerable in the abodes of
our ancestors (though in ruins), that it is much to be wished,
the frequent practice of carrying them away, for the purpose
of making dykes, or sences, was for ever abolished.  The
remains of the bridge of Offers, about a quarter of a mile
westward of the Peel, by which Wallace crossed the Forth,
on his way to the moss of Kinkardine, are still in existence;
and for several years, it has been in agitation to rebuild it,
which would greatly facilitate the communication betwixt
the parishes on both sides of the river, and encourage tenants
to give an additional rent for their farms.

   Extent.-This parish extends about three miles and an

and carse farms.  On the south is the muir, which is part of
a hilly tract of ground, stretching out from Stirling to Dum-
barton.  That portion of the muir which belongs to this
parish, consists of about 3000 acres, of which each heritor
has a division, lying in a direct line with his other lands.
   The muir has of late become an object of greater conside-
ration, than in former periods.  The demand for such pas-
ture is much increased; and this has naturally led the pro-
prietors to set a higher value on it, than they were ac-
customed to do a few years ago.  Every one has his own
