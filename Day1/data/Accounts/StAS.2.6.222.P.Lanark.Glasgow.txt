to the post-office, to be made up in the separate lines of mails, as
they are successively dispatched. There are four complete de-
liveries of letters now made daily to every part of the town and
suburbs; and an answer may be received the same day to a penny
post letter put into the office, or a receiving-house, in time to be
sent out with either of the two first deliveries.

              Gross revenue for the year, L. 37483       3      4 1/2
	The number of penny post letters for Glasgow delivery, exclu-
sively of those delivered through the 26 out-penny offices, was,
from October 1833 to October 1834, 192,491; and the amount
of the revenue derived from them L. 802,0s. 11d. When it is con-
sidered, that, in 1833, the revenue was only L. 1700 more than in
1815, whilst the population bad increased in the same period up-
wards of 72,000, and the increase of correspondence in a still greater
ratio, we are led to believe that the revenue is greatly defrauded
by private carrying.
	Rental and Stamps.--The rental of the city and suburbs in 1834
was L. 539,466. Amount of stamps sold in 1828, L. 91,213; in
1830, L. 103,802;. in 1834, L. 10,930.
	Water Companies.--Prior to 1804, the city was scantily supplied
by twenty-nine public, and a few private wells. In 1806, the Glas-
gow Water Company was incorporated, and in 1808 the Cranston
Hill Company. From their commencement, till 31st May 1830,
the companies had laid out L. 320,244, 1Os. ld. on their works,
which are now considerably extended. In 1831 there were 38,237
renters of water in the city and suburbs. Rates for 1834: Houses
rented under L. 4, 5s. per annum; ditto: L. 4 and under L. 5, 6s.;
L. 5 and not above L. 6, 7s. 6d, all above L. 6, 6 1/4 per cent., or
1s, 3d. per pound on rental. Public works high service i,e. in the
more elevated parts of the city, L. 12, 10s, for 1000 gallons per
day; low service L. 6, ditto, workmen for drinking, 6d. per head;
founderies 1s, per man; lowest charge for a public work, L. 4.
Counting-houses, 5s. to 10s. 6d.; water-closets in ditto, 5s. to
10s 6d. horses, 4s.; cows, 3s.
