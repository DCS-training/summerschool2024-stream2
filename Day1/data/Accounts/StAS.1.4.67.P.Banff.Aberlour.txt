otters, etc.  It is also stored with fowls and birds.  Be-
ing a highland country, abounding with woods, and al-
most surrounded with hills, there are muirfowls, pa-
tridges, plovers, snipes, lapwings, cormorants, hawks
magpies, and woodcocks at their season; sometimes
eagles are seen upon Belrinnes, and some of their feathers
are found there; the night owl also shows itself.  The
migratory birds are the cuckoo, which appears in the
beginning of April and disappears in August; the lap
wing, about the month of March, and is seldom seen
after the end of July; the swallow about the first of
June, and disappears in the end of July; the wood-
cock about October, and is scarce seen after April.-The
parish produces grain of all sorts, with any due culture;
and not only supplies itself but sells oats, meal and
barley, sometimes to the highlands and sometimes for
exportation.  It has also abundance of barren timber, es-
pecially oak, allar and birch, which grow naturally in large
woods and some plantations of firs are lately planted.  There
are also fruit-trees, such as apple, pear, cherry trees. etc.
in some gardens.  Turnip and potatoes begin now to be
raised on every farm, though, being but lately introduced,
in small quantities.  The practice of planting cabbage in
the fields has not got in here; nor is it likely that it will
be introduced soon, as almost all the fields are without
any fence; and winter herding is not practiced.  There  
is also some flax raised, but not hemp; and no great quan-
tities of sown grass.
