parts of Scotland pay no part of it, and the most remote
and poorest parts of the kingdom pay the whole.  A grie-
vance of this kind, merits the attention of Parliament, and
ought to be redressed, by abolishing the tax altogether, or
substituting an equivalent in its stead on some other article, to
be levied throughout all Scotland.  Such a tax would be the
meerest trifle to the kingdom at large, could be grudged by 
none, who had any regard to substantial justice, and would
deliver this part of the country from a brievous burden,
without the removal of which, neither its commerce nor
its agreculture can prosper.

   Poor.-The number of paupers in this place is very
great.  This is owing in part to the many charitable insti-
tutions in Montrose;-to the character its inhabitants have
long maintained of kindness to strangers, and liberality to
the poor;-and partly, indeed, to the different manufac-
tures, to which men advanced in life, and reduced in circum-
stances, repair for bread to themselves and numverous fa-
milies, and who, within a few years, become a burden on
the public.
   Of the funds allotted for the use of the poor, those be-
longing  to the church-sessions are the largest, and managed,
in general, with the greatest impartiality; without any re-
spect to persons, station, employment, or principle, religi-
ous or political.  The monthly pensioners amount at present
to about 168.  Besides these, occasional supplies are ordered
for otheres at the monthly meetings.  Such persons as, in the
interval, are reduced to temporary distress, apply to the elder
of church-warden, belonging to the division of the town
of country parish, where they reside, who recommends them
to the moderator of the session.  Upon this, the moderator
issues out an order to the treasures called a precept, to give
     Vol. V. F
