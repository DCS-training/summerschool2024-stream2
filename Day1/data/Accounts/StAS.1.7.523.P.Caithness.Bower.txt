a greater quantity of oat-meal is brought to the market from
this than almost any parish in Caithness.  The quantity of
victual sold annually by the proprietors alone, out of their
rents and farms, will be upwards of 2000 bolls.-The parish
is divided at present among six proprietors, two of whom re-
side in it.

   Rent and Services.-The valued rent of the parish is 2761 L
16 s. Scotch; the real rent about 1500 L Sterling; and
would, no doubt, be much advanced, if the farmers had
sufficient encouragement to improve and inclose their posses-

vices and customs which are still more or less exacted almost
every where in this parish, according to ancient practice;
though, in many places, some of them are converted into
money, and not unlimited as formerly.  Benjamin William-
son, younger of Banneskirk, seems to have done most in
abolishing the servitude on part of his estate in this parish,
and has further encouraged some of his tenants, by giving
leases of 19 years.  The conversion of services has hitherto
been gradual and progressive; and perhaps the most advise-
able plan, for the present, is to exact victual rather than
money for them, as the poor people are frequently at a loss

called upon, to come out to their master's work; and the
service performed was executed in the most slovenly and su-
perficial manner possible.  Besides the unprofitableness of
this scheme, it was most pernicious in a moral view, as it laid
a foundation for every indolent and dishonest habit.  In the
next stage, a partial limitation and restriction took place;
