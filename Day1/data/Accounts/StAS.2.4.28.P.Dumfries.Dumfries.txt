Lochar Moss, and much more may yet be done, if sufficient en-
couragement be given. The cutting of a channel at the mouth
of the Lochar, so as to secure to its waters a free escape into the
Solway Firth, or the forming of a canal (as has been proposed,)
from the quarry of Lochar bridge to that estuary, is considered to
be the only effectual mode by which the moss might be drained.
The greatest obstacle to the accomplishment of this desirable ob-
ject, is a mill which stands near the mouth of the Lochar, and to
the removal of which there are at present insuperable difficulties.
From Lochar Bridge to the sea the distance is more than ten miles,
and the fall is only thirty feet; so that, in consequence of the dam
which is attached to the mill, a body of dead water, more than six
feet in depth, is kept standing in the bed of the river for several
miles, completely saturating the spongy soil in every direction.
