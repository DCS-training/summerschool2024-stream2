bounds, as well as by the influential people in general.
  Literature.-There are the following libraries in the town of
Rothesay. 1. Rothesay Library, instituted in 1792, with 1400
vols. 2. Rothesay Youths, 1818, with 1200 vols. 3. Mechanics,

Reformed Presbyterian Congregational, 1837, with 130 vols. 6.
Parochial school, 1837, with 160 vols. There is in the custody
of the minister of the parish, a library consisting of books left to
the parish by the last Bishop of the Isles, who had his residence in
Rothesay; and of a valuable addition gifted by the Rev. Dugald
Stewart, formerly minister of this parish, and grandfather of the
late Professor Dugald Stewart of Edinburgh. Among the books
there is a copy of Bishop Bedell's Bible, and a copy of the rare
edition of the Irish Testament of 1681. There are in all 200 vo-
lumes. There are two public reading-rooms. The first was opened
1790. They are both of easy access, and possess most of the
leading journals of the day. A small periodical has lately been
begun to be published here, called Bute Record of Rural Affairs,
in connection with the Bute Farmers' Society, instituted in 1825.
It is conducted by Mr Samuel Girdwood, land-steward of the
Marquis of Bute, and is valuable to agriculturists.
  Charitable Institutions.-The following Benvolent or Friendly
Societies exist, and have been of great benefit in promoting the
independdnce and comfort of families. They sdem, however, to
be rather on the decline, as usually happens when the original
members become old and infirm. The young are reluctant to
join at a time when a great number are receiving aliment from the
funds. The Rothesay Society was instituted in 1786; the
Rothesay Marine Society in 1790; the Rothesay Cotton Mill
