that this building resembled in size, form, and the solid charac-
ter of its masonry, the old mansion-house of the Duguids of Auch-
enhove; that behind these ruined walls a few stunted gooseberry
bushes rose out of the green sward; that this ancient structure
was called Haa-ton House, belonging to a family that once pos-
sessed the surrounding estate, bounded on the west by the Burn
of Brankum, and extending towards the east beyond Craigton and
Burnside; that about sixty years ago the tenant of Bogloch, ani-
mated by a zeal for improvement, razed Haa-ton House to the
foundation, and that the stones of which it was composed were
employed in erecting the rude like that now surrounds the mound,
and in building, houses in the neighbourhood:-these are facts
which are attested by eye-witnesses, who, though they have ar-
rived at a mature old age, possess the perfect use of their faculties,
and by a multitude of men in middle-life, whose fathers saw the
ruins of Haa-ton House, before they were touched by the hands of
this zealous agriculturist.
	Viewing the facts recorded in ancient documents, in connection
with the facts banded down by tradition, we may form the conjec-
ture, that, about the year 1400, the wooden castle erected on the
artificial mound was superseded by a building of stone; that the
more modern structure, which bore the inarne of Haa-ton House,
was, during a part of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the re-
sidence of families who possessed the surrounding estate, including
Halton, which might easily come to be pronounced Haa-ton,-a
more natural corruption, indeed, than the modern Hilton, Pit-
murchie, and Craigamore or Craigton,-and that the proprietors
of the eastern section of the parish of Lumphanan found, in the
moat which surrounded their mansion-house, a protection against
the attacks of feudal chiefs, animated by the love of plunder, or
smarting under the sense of private wrongs.
         The Houff.-At a remote period of Scottish history, the Heoff
was a place of strength; the traces of ancient buildings are still
visible; and very little labour would be necessary to complete the
moat by which it was surrounded, and fill it with water. At a
more recent date, it became the burial-ground of the Duguids;-
the tradition of the country being, that one of the lairds of Auch-
enhove, to prevent the necessity of his body being carried after his
death through the lands of Auchlossan, erected, on his own pro-
perty, a place of sepulture for himself and his family.*

<FOOTNOTE>The Houff has probably given its name to the surrounding property,,-Auch
