families, spend much of their time, in spring, in preparing
some potatoe land, and in carrying manure from the shore
on their backs, which they spread on such moss land as they
procure; for the sea-ware is very abundant, and proves good
manure for moss ground.  The summer, again, is employed
in cutting their own peats, and the peats of those on whom
they depend for a house, or a cow's grass, or any other ad-
vantages they enjoy; which are all paid for in labour of this
kind.  They are also frequently employed, on similar terms,
in harvest, as they get ground for sowing flax-seed, which
they pay for, by assisting the farmers in cutting down their
barley and oats; nothing else being sown here excepting pota-
toes, which is the only support of the poor.  They also catch
some grey fish and cod, which they dry, and keep for winter
provisions; and they sometimes get a few herrings in the
winter season; but the herrings are only driven here in stormy
weather, and seldom continue any time.

   Poor.-The number of those who apply to the kirk-session
for charity, seldom exceeds 20 as we have no fund for their
relief, except what is collected on Sabbath in the church,
which is very trifling.  However, the wants of the poor are
partly supplied by the tenants at their own houses, where
they give freely what is necessary for their maintainance and
clothing.  The natives are very hospitable to strangers; and
are often imposed upon by vagrant beggars, who are very
capable of working for their own support.  Giving charity
to such persons is an encouragement to idleness and vice,
which every friend to mankind ought to discourage, and re-
ward the opposite virtues of industry and sobriety.

   Church, etc.-The old church walls are entire, though the
roof was demolished many years ago.  It is about a century
