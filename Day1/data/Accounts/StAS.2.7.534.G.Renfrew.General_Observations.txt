534             GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

Renfrewshire, when treating of this subject, remarks, that "it is al-
most impossible for the most heedless observer to travel along that
part of the coast (composed of old red sandstone) without being for-
cibly struck by the marks which it affords of the former higher level
of the sea,"  Mr Montgomery does not pretend to say whether
the water has receded, or the land has been elevated, but sup-
poses the water had once extended to cliffs thirty or forty feet
above the present level of the sea.  There are abundance of
rounded boulders of primitive and transition rocks at the foot of
these cliffs, and the level land which intervenes between them and
the frith is "full of shells exactly similar to those which are still
plentiful on the adjacent shores;" or, as is very graphically stated
in the account of Greenock parish, where no theory was in view,
when speaking of the soil, it is affirmed that, "on the shore, it con-
sists chiefly of clay, mingled with sea shellss and gravel." Nu-
merous boles,formerly ocupied by the pholas, are also seen in the
rocks far above the present level of that animal's habitations. Mr
Stevenson, in a paper read before the Wernerian Society in 1816,
takes a somewhat different view of this subject, and is at great
pains to illustrate, in that and a subsequent paper, the "wasting of
the land by the encroachment of the sea," instead of its recession.
He remarks that "all along the coast of Galloway, and shores of
the shires of Ayr, Renfrew, and Bute, the wasting effects of the
sea are equally remarkable." At the town of Stranraer, the houses
along the shore had formerly gardens between them at high-water-
mark, but, of late years, the inhabitants have been under the ne
cessity of erecting bulwarks to secure the walls and approaches to
their houses.  At the village of Kirkholrn, a neck of land called
Scar-Ridge, extended into the loch about half-a-mile, on which
cattle used formerly to be grazed, is now nearly washed away, and
in high tides is laid wholly under water.  Observations of a similar
mature occur on various parts of the Frith of Clyde, which do not
exactlv agree with the theory of a former high level, or the pre-
sent recession of the waters of the ocean from our coasts.  Mr
Stevenson attributes the process of waste and decay going on along
the shores of our friths and seas to the impulse and action of the
sea, and this, he supposes, is, in a great measure, owing to the im-
means quantity of debris accumulated, and accumulating, at leasts
to a certain depth, in the bottom of the sea.  This theory is in
some measure confirmed, by the act of a submarine island hav-
ing been formed in the neck of the Frith, after losing the charac-
