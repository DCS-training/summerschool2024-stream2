or poor man's weather-glass (Anagallis tenella), the asphodel, the
hawkweed, the anemone, the corncockle, the wood-sorrel, the
parnassia, the periwinkle (Vinca major), the gentian, the mares-
tail, the cudweed, the cinquefoil, the bitter-sweet (Solanum dul-
camara), the bilberry, the cranberry, the great valerian, and
many species of Orchis, amongst others the white and the sweet
smelling, are all to be found in their respective habitats,--such of
them as are peculiar to moors and meadows being most abund-
ant. But to a lover of botany the banks of the Dee, where they
are most wooded and rocky, that is, for nearly a mile before it
joins the sea, present a field both for variety and beauty which
many days may be spent in exploring. The unusual number of
plants is easily accounted for, by the sharp and rugged nature of
the channel, which is well adapted to receive deposits of soil and
seed brought down by the river. Great part of it is dry for many
months during the year, and thus the new plants have time to
take a firm hold, and to propagate either by the seed, the joints,
or the root. Being both exposed to the sun, and sheltered from
the wind, they have every advantage of locality, and spring up with
a rapidity and profusion, of which, within so limited a spot, there
are very few examples. Besides most of those which I have already
mentioned, I may note the following: Adoxa moschatellina, agri-
mony, ashweed, Allium oleraceum (wild garlic), A. ursinum (ram.-
sons), Bunium flexuosum (the pignut), bird's-foot trefoil, Campa-
nula patula * (the field bell flower), cistus, centaurea, coltsfoot
(Tussilago farfara), common rue, comfrey (Symphytum officinale),
convolvulus (Sepium), cow-parsnep, pimpernel rose, (Rosa spinosis-
sima) dog's rose (white and red), Epilobium (two species), eyebrigbt
(Euphrasia), figwort (Scrophularia nodosa), fumitory, geum (two
species), geranium (five species, perhaps more), golden rod, ground
ivy, great mullein (Verbascum Thapsus), Guelder rose, honey-
suckle, house-leek (Sempervivum tectorum), hyacinth, Iris, Jasione,
lady's bedstraw (white and yellow), lady's mantle, lily of the valley
(Convallaria majalis), Lysimachia nemorum (yellow pimpernel of
the woods), marestail. (Hippuris vulgaris), marsh mallow (Malva
moschata), marsh marigold, milfoil yarrow, (the mouse ear), Myo-
sotis arvensis and palustris orpine, Potentilla, primrose, purging,
flax (Linum catharticum), purple-spiked willow herb (Lythrum sa-
licaria), queen of the meadow, saxifrage, shaking grass (the "silver

<FOOTNOTE>The Campanula latifolia is not found, in so far as I know, within the parish, but
it occurs in two neighbouring ones.
