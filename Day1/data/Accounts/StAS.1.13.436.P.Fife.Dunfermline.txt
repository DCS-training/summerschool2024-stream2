in the neighbourhood of coals, and the inhabitants of this 
place have but a scanty supply, especially in  summer.
Water is brought in pipes from about a mile's distance, but 
the fountain is not sufficiently abudant.  The greatest dis-
advantage felt by the manufacturers and shop-keepers is 
their distance from the sea ; the land-carriage they are ob-
liged to employ being expensive.  A canal from the Ne-
thertown to run S. W. about two miles, and join the sea
near Lord Elgin's lime-works at Charlestown is said to be
easily practicable, and that only a few locks would be ne-
cessary.  Should such a canal be formed, many advantages
might accrue to Dunfermline as a place of trade, and much
expense be saved in the conveyance of coals for exporta-
tion:  Foreign wood likewise might be brought at an easy
rate to Dunfermline, and the neighbouring parishes supplied 
with that commodity at considerably less expense.

at large; at present they may have 400 1/2 cwt. of coal on the hill for 7 d.
or laid down at their doors for 1 s. the carriage being 5 d.  But it is to be 
regretted that the road to this coal is bad, and that it is worked in such a 
way that carts are often obliged to wait long on the hill before they are
served.

*The North Ferry is legally in this parish, but its population is not in-
cluded.  The population of the estates of Urqubart and Logie, near Dun-
fermline, but which are legally in the parish of Inverkeithing, is in-
cluded.
