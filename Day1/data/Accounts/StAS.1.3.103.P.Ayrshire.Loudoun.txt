     Name, Extent, Etc.

   THE parish of Loudoun is situated in that part of the
shire of Ayr called Cunningham, a Danish word sig-
nifying a royal seat.  Its name Loudoun is, probably, deriv-
ed from a hill in the extremity of the parish, called Loudoun,
from the old word low, or fire, and don a hill.  Its extent
from east to west is nine English miles; its breadth towards
Eaglesham is about seven miles; but at the west extremity it
is not above three miles broad.  There are four villages in
the parish, first Newmilns an antient borough of barony.
Their charter of erection the inhabitants obtained from
James IV.  It contains about 1000 inhabitants.  The other
three villages owe their origin and increase to the family of
Loudoun.  Derville, or Derval, contains about 400 inhabi-
tants.
