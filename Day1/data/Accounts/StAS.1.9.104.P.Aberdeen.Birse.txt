now it obtains the name of Birse.  The names of the great-

   Extent and Situation.-Its extent from E. to W. is about
10 measured miles, and, including that range of the Gram-
pian hills belonging to the parish; its extent from the ri-
ver Dee on the N. towards the S. is in many place, nothing
less.  It is indeed narrower towards the east end on the pa-
rish, but by all who are thoroughly acquainted with in ex-
tent, it is deemed equal to a figure of 10 miles quire.
The parish church is distant from Aberdeen, the nearest
post town, about 27 measured miles.  It is the most sou-
therly parish in the county of Aberdeen.  With respect to
the inhabited part of the parish, it may be divided into
three large straths or districts.  The largest of which, in
the south-east end of the parish is called Feughside, (or vul-
garly the Eastside of the hill, meaning Corse Dardar.) It
has the Feugh running through it.  It is about 3 miles
long and 2 broad.  The house of Finzean is in the north
west corner of it, and being surrounded on the north and
west by hills and woods, is remarkably sheltered and plea-
santly situated.  Its name Finzean, is said by those con-
versant in the Gaelic language to be descriptive of its plea-
sant situation.  The heritor has always resided.  Directly west
on the banks of the Feugh, and among the Grampian hills
is situated the Forest or Glen Birse, partly inclosed and cul-
tivated, and partly in common for pasture.  The middle
strath or district is called the Water, vulgarly the burn of
Chattie, as that burn runs through it.  It is about 4 miles
long and 1 broad.  On the south of the burn is Midstrath,
and on the north Ballogie, formerly named Tillysnaught,
