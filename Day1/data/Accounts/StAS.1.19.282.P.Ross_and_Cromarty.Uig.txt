length of the coast, following the shore in all its windings
around Loch Roag, is 40 computed miles; the shore is
rocky.  Dogfish, cod, ling, and colefish are abundant
here.  Great quantities of herrings, of uncommonly large
size, have begun to be caught in this loch within these few
years.  The herrings make their appearance about the 20th
of December, and remain to the middle of January; this
last year, (1794), upwards of 90 fail came from different
parts of the kingdom; they both fished, and bought the
herring fresh from the country-people, at the great price of
from 9 s. to 12 s. per crane, (which is the full of a barrel
of green fish, as taken out of the net).  The uncommon
gales of wind which prevailed this winter, became fatal to
some of the fishers, and rendered their success upon the
whole much less than it was any year since the fishing last
commenced.  Forty years back, and long before, there
was an immense herring-fishing in Loch Roag.  Sweden
was then the only market for the fish, and the abundance
was such, that the country-people sold them for 1 s. per
foresaid crane.  The cod is very plentiful in this loch du-
ring the herring-fishing, and when the herrings emigrate,
they soon disappear.  The cods are sold fresh by the coun-
try-people at 2 d. each.  Such of the inhabitants as incline
to take the trouble of curing them, can be supplied with
salt for the purpose from two storehouses erected there by
Mr Mackenzie of Seaforth, in which salt is kept for the
benefit of the people.  Muscles are found so plentiful that
lime is made of their shells.  Oysters, clams, and coc-
kles, are found here.  There are about 140 tons of kelp
annually made at Loch Roag, which is superior in quality
to any other kelp in the Highlands of Scotland; this is suf-
ficiently evinced by its selling for at least a guinea per ton
more than any other kelp.  Gallan-head is one of the
chief promontories; it lies at the south-west entry to Loch
