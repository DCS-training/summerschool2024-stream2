   Proprietors, Rents.-The number of heritors in the parish is
10, and only one at present resides in it.  The valued rent is
L. 6060 Scots; the real rent is nearly L. 3300 sterling.  In
the course of 20 years, the parish has increased much in its
rise of rents, improvement, and cultivation.  During this
short period, all the estates in it have been sold, except 3, to
new proprietors; and a good many of the farms have got new
tenants.  The same causes may have concurred to effectuate
these alterations here, which have taken place in other parishes
of Scotland.  The estates were bought at a time when there
was no demand for land; but were they now in the market,
they certainly would fell at a much higher price.
