is evident.  Further, I have seen in them numbers of small
round hard stones, in the form of a very flat or oblate
sphere, of 2 1/2 inches thick in the centre, and about 4 inches
in diameter.  I have also seen other round stones, perfectly
circular, very plain and level on one side, with a small rise
at the circumference, and about a foot in diameter.  Now,
I think the intention of both these kinds of stones is mani-
fest.  It was certainly to break and grind their grain, as
they had no mills or machines for that purpose.  This they
did, by breaking the grain on the larger stone, with the
small round oblate stone in their hand.
   Besides these buildings of stone, several of which were
prodigious, there are in various parts of the parish ditches
or intrenchments no less astonishing, edged on the outside,
or opposite parapet, with large mounds of earth and stone,
and inclosing a deep hollow in the centre.  These were cer-
tainly encampments, in which they fortified and intrenched
themselves in the time of encounter, or when they took
the field for actual engagement.  Pitched battles have
surely been fought in these places; and the remains of
stones that have been erected near, and at several distances,
from these intrenchments, were designed as memorials of
persons of note, who have fallen either in close battle, or
in the retreat or pursuit.  But what these battles were, at
what time, and by whom they were fought, or who were
the eminent persons who fell, and for whom these memo-
rials were erected, I believe is not to be found.  By the
bye, I have no doubt but some of these stones would be
erected in order to defend a few persons from the missile
weapons of the enemy, and to give them the advantage of
dismissing their own missile weapons at them with the
greater success and security, on what side soever of the stone
they made their approach.
