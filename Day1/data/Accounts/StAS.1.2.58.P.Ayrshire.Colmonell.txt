     Statistical Account

   Situation and Extent.-The parish is situated in that district
of the country of Ayr called Carrick.  At the first settlement of
presbyteries in Scotland, it was proposed, according to Cal-
derwood's history, to make it the seat of a presbytery; but this
not taking place, it was first placed in the presbytery of Ayr,
and synod of Glasgow and Ayr; but was afterwards annexed
to the presbytery of Stranraer, and synod of Galloway, united
to which it now remains.  As Stranraer is very distant, and
the presbytery of Ayr, perhaps, at present, too numerous
a body, the erection of a new presbytery in Carrick, for the
seat of which Girvan or Daily would be pretty centrical
and commodious, has been suggested.  It was originally of
uncommon large extent; but when the parish of Barr was e-
rected, all the lands of Ardmillan, extending three miles along
the shore, and about two miles inland, were disjoined from
Colmonell and annexed to Girvan.  A very large parish, how-
ever, still remains; its greatest length from west to east, be-
ing about fourteen computed miles, and its average breadth a-
bout fix.

   Surface, Soil, and Climate.-The surface varies in different
parts of the parish.  From the sea, towards the inland parts
of the country, it is very hilly for about four miles.  The rest
of the parish, though more elevated above the level of the
sea, is flat.  The soil is general thin and light, seldom above
the ordinary depth of a plough surrow, mostly upon a tilly
bottom, and pretty much encumbered with stones.  The flat
land, however, upon the sides of the river, is a loamy soil, mix-
ed with sand of a good depth, and particulary well calculated for
fruit trees.-There are seven gardens, or orchards in the
parish, all of whom produce apples, pears, plumbs, cherries,
and the smaller fruits in the greatest perfection.-In regard to
climate, there are few places in Ayrshire, or in the south west
