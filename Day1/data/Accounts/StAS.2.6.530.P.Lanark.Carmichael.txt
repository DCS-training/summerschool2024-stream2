the parish which might be rendered more productive, though it
would certainly be unwise for tenants to bestow much labour or ex-
pense on improvements towards the end of their leases. But when
the leases are renewed, let the tenants be compelled, by an obliga-
tory clause, or induced by some encouragement held out to them
to improved those parts of their farms, which are susceptible of im-
provement, by draining, liming, or deep ploughing, with a subsoil
plough, or otherwise, and, before the expiration of their leases,
many abres, saturated with stagnant water, or covered with rank
heath, will be converted into dry fields, producing rich crops of
grain or close herbage.
	Quarries and Mines.--Beside the coal seams, there are quarries
of limestone and sandstone. The coal seams form an angle with,
the horizon of 13O&deg; to 35&deg;, and dip to the north-west. The coal is
now sold at 9d. the load, of twelve pecks of Linlithgow measure,
or rather more than 2 1/2 cwt. The cart load of four loads common-
ly exceeds 10 cwt. The burnt tinslaked limestone is sold at 1s.
6d. per boll of about six bushels. The hewn sandstone for plinth
and rybats costs 7d, or Sd. a foot. Between the coal seams and
sandstone are found thick strata of slate-clay and bituminous shale,
containing ironstone of different shapes and dimensions; but whe-
ther the ore is sufficiently rich and plentiful to encourage the
working of it, has not been ascertained.
	Averaqe gross amount of Raw Produce.--In venturing to give an
estimate of the amount of raw produce, I wish the following state-
ment to be considered rather as a matter of opinion, founded partly
on returns made to me, than as a matter of fact. The data are
furnished, and if any person who is acquainted with the soil and
climate of the parish, think the amount either too great or too
small, he may apply the necessary correction to the error.
