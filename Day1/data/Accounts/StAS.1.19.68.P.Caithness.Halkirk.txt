ers go in humble prostration before the master miller, and
present their petition to his majesty.  His interest is too
much concerned; he knows the millers cannot pay him,
unless they are very severe; he turns his back, bids the di-
stressed suppliants good day; he has nothing to do with
the mill; it is subset; let them agree with the millers.
Thus they all sin by proxy, and the poor suckener is the
sacrifice.  Thus the proprietor and tenant pay dearly for
this additional rent, for more reasons than one, which are
too obvious to be mentioned.  However, it is not amiss to
produce an instance.  There is a tack in my neighbour-
hood, the rent of which is L. 46.  It is as much a grass as
a corn tack.  This tack pays the mill, according to the
present price of victual, L. 8, 10 s. which is very near 1-
5th of the rent; and yet the miller is not satisfied.  Not
many years ago, the multure, etc. paid out of this farm
was not near one half of what it is now, neither was the
produce of it less, however more.

   Conclusion.-Now all these evils, and many more, might
be removed, and many great advantages introduced, if the
present state of things were modified, or in some measure
altered.  This, I think, might be easily effected; and the
parish is a most excellent subject for it.  I need not
point out the means whereby this desirable end would
most likely be brought about.  They are obvious to
common observation.  If the heritors had attended more
to their own true interest, and considered that of their
tenants as their own, for they are inseparable; if they
had done this, it would naturally and necessarily lead
them into this meliorating plan; but the difficulty is to
persuade them that the adoption of such a plan would be
their interest.  The temptation of present gain makes
them blind to what would enlarge their future prospects,
