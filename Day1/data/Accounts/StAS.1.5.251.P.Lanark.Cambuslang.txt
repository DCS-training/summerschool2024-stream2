since the Union of the two kingdoms, has availed itself, in
some degree, of this advantage.  Its manufactures and
commerce had been advancing gradually, though slowly,
from that period to the middle of the century, when it
first began to make a rapid progress.  This was chiefly
owing to the great increase of the tobacco trade, which
had hitherto been much obstructed by the dealers in that
commodity, residing in London, Bristol, Liverpool, and
Whitehaven.  These dealers, after all their attempts to de-
stroy this trade had proved abortive, were obliged to aban-
don them, and from that time, which was towards the mid-
dle of the century, the tobacco trade of Glasgow was car-
ried on with equal vigour and success.  In consequence of
this lucrative trade, the city and its inhabitants, in a short
time, assumed a different appearance.  A new and better
stile was introduced in building, and in furniture, as well as
in dress and living.  These improvements in Glasgow soon
began to stew themselves in the surrounding country.  An
increasing demand for the articles which land produces, and
a consequent rise of prices in the market, gave life and vi-
gour to the exertions of the farmer.  Growing wealth begat
new wants, and a taste for imitation began to operate.  The
farmer, as well as the merchant, came by degrees to relish
the conveniencies, and even the luxuries of life; a remark-
able change took place in his lodging, clothing, and manner
of living.  The difference in the state of the country, in the
value of land and mode of cultivation, in the price of pro-
visions and the wages of labour, in food and cloathing, be-
tween the years 1750 and 1790, deserves to be particularly
recorded.
