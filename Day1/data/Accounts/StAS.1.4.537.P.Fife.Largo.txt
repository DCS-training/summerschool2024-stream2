of cultivating it shall be ascertained, and generally under-
stood.-Cattle are reared in considerable numbers; much
attention is paid to the breed.  The consequence of which
is well known, as our cattle have been distinguished for
beauty and size even in the London market.  Horses are
bred, both for draught and saddle.  Sheep are sed, not pro-
duced here.  Every family has swine.-In our quarries
are found hard and freestone.  Limestone is wrought in
2 different places.  There is an extensive field of marl;
and coal may be wrought to advantage.  On the estate of
Lundin, the coal has been cropped; but by erecting an en-
gine near to the sea, a deep seam, which stretches over up-
on the estate of Largo, would be opened.  This would am-
ply supply the neighbourhood, and afford besides a con-
siderable exportation.

   Sea-coast, Fisheries, etc.-The south boundary of this pa-
rish is about 2 1/2 miles of sea-coast.  Largo Bay extends from
Kingcraig Point to that of the Methul, making a diameter
of near 7 miles in lenght, and marked by a ridge of sand.
The included bay forms a semicircle of about 10 mile
tea-coast.  The above ridge is called by fishermen the
Dike.  Of this there is a tradition, although probably not
well founded, among the oldest inhabitants of Largo, that
there was formerly a wall or mound running from King-
craig Point to that of the Methul, containing within it a
vast forest, called the Wood of Forth.-About 10 years
ago, fish abounded on this coast, particularly haddock, of a
very delicate kind.  But since that period, fish of every
kind have become scarce, in so much that there is not a
haddock in the bay.  All that remain, are a few small
10 d, podlies and slounders.  The fishermen have also dif-
appeared, who, 20 years ago, constituted  the chief part of
the inhabitants of Largo and Drumochy.  At present there
