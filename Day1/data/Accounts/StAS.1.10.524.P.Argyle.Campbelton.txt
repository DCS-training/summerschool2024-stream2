     Statistical Account

   According to the genealogy of the book of Lecan, Ferehar
Fada, the successor of Malduine, was of the house of Lorn.
But his successor, Achy Rineval, grandson of Donal Brec,
was of the Fergusian or Cantirian line, and held the unsteady
sceptre only 2 or 3 years, when it was seized by Anchellach,
son of Ferchar Fada.  But he had scarce got hold of it,
when it was wrested from him by his own brother Selvac,
who seized the King, (after having burned his palace of Dun-
olly) and sent him in chains to Ireland.  From thence he
returned; after 12 years, with some assistance which he had
procured, and, in attempting to recover his kingdom, fell in
the battle of Finglirn, a small valley in the mountains of
Lorn.
   These domestic quarrels of the house of Lorn, gave the
family of Fergus some time to recover.  Accordingly, we
find in the same year (718), Doncha Beg, (or Little Duncan)
who is stiled only King of Kintyre, disputing the sovereignty
with Selvac, and defeating him in a desperate sea engage-
ment; which was fought off Ardinesse, a cape or promontory
of Argyll, that has now lost its ancient name.  Doncha
died in 720, but Achy, (probably his son,) and the grand-
son of Donal Duine, continued the contest with Selvac for
5 or 6 years longer; till, in 726, he prevailed so far as to ob-
tain a division of the district of Argyll, which lay between Kin-
tyre and Lorn, and was often the subject of contention, when
neither house could entirely subdue the other.  In 729, Sel-
vac died, and Achy succeeded, as it would seem, to the whole
kingdom, for he is stiled, by Tighearnach, Rex Dalriadd, or
King of Dalruaidh.  After his death, which is placed in
733, the succession is not clear.  The two houses, as for-
merly in the case of Fergus and Lorn, and lately of Selvac and
uncan, seem, at times, to have had separate Kings, and, by
that means, to have occasioned some confusion in the list of
