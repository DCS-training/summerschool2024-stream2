hiring shearers.  Both of these objects seemed in a fair way
of taking place a few years ago; the design however was
afterwards dropped*.
   When the scheme of joining the rivers Forth and Clyde by
a navigable canal was first projocted, it was doubted which of
the two was the preferable course, viz. the southern track,
nearly the same with what was actually adopted; or "the
"other, by following the river Forth for some miles above
"Stirling, and then crossing over by the bog of Bolatt into
"the water of Endrick, down to Loch Lomond, and from
"thence by the river Leven into the Clyde at Dunbarton+."
Though this plan was rejected, yet it deserves the considera-
tion of all the proprietors on both sides of the Forth, whether
it might be proper to have that river rendered navigable as
far up as Gartmore.  It appears from Mr Smeaton's report,
that this is not only a practicable undertaking, but might be
executed at no great expence.  "Two locks and one dam
"would make an open navigation from Gartmore to the
"Frith of Forth, at all seasons of the year; and was there
"any trade of consequence up this extensive valley, would
"be worth the while, independent of a navigable commu-
"nication between the two seas.  One lock ought to be placed
"opposite Craigforth mill, and the lock and dam at the ford
"of Frew.  This with a little clearance of the shoal, at Car-
"dross, would make a navigable passage over the same++."
The advantages resulting from such a plan, in furnishing us
with coal, lime, etc. in opening new markets for our grain,
