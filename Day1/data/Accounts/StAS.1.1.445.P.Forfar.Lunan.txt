   Population.-From comparing the present number of inha-
bited houses and of baptisms, with those of any particular
period of the present century, it does not appear that the pa-
rish has suffered any material alteration in population.  If
there be any difference at all, it seems rather to have increa-
sed in a small degree.  The present amount of its population
is 291; of these 136 are females, and 155 males; among
whom are 46 married or widowers, and 26 marriageable
batchelors.  There are 46 souls under 10 years of age, 74
from 10 to 20, 114 from 20 to 50, 51 from 50 to 70; and
6 from 70 to 100.  The annual average of births, for 50
years backwards, is about 9, being in proportion to the whole
population as 1 to 32, of marriages 3, and of deaths 4.  A
farmer's family, at an average, consists of 10 persons.  There
are in the parish 13 weavers, 1 carpenter, 1 blacksmith, 1
shoemaker, and 4 apprentices.  The number of servants in
the parish is 68; of people born in other parishes there are
176; and it is remarkable that there is but 1 farmer, and a 
very few other householders, who were born and now reside
in the parish.  The number of children for each marriage is,
at an average, about 4.  All the inhabitants, except one fe-
male servant, who has only a temporary residence in the pa-
rish, are of the established church.

   Church.-The value of the minister's living, including the
glebe, at a moderate conversion of what is paid in victual, is
about 88 guineas.  The patronage of the parish belonged to
