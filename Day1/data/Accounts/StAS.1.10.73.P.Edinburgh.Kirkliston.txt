   +From this table, it appears that there are 4 1/2 persons to a
family, and that the proportions betwixt males and females
is as 8 of the former to 9 of the latter.  It is presumed that
every other useful proportion connected with population
may be deduced from this table.  The vast disproportion be-
tween the numbers in the families of the farmers and of the
cottagers, may be partly accounted for by the latter being
obliged to send their children sooner into the world, and the
servants employed by the former.  The return to Dr Webster
in 1755 was 1461 souls.  The average of baptisms for 11
years preceding 1790, is 48; of these the proportion of males
to females is as 8 of the former to 5 of the latter.  The ac-
curacy of the records, however, cannot altogether be depend-
ed on; and of those children which are not inserted, the
probability is, that the greatest number are females.  The
average of marriages during the forementioned 11 years, is
11 1/2; and of the deaths, no accurate account can be given.
