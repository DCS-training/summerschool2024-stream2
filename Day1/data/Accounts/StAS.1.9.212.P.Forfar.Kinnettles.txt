In fact, there is no occupation among us, or in the country
in general, from which greater profits may not be obtain-
ed.  What extent of learning and qualifications is to be
demanded or expected from a person, whose office yields
him hardly the bare necessaries of life?  I think we are
just on the verge of having schools remaining vacant; the
office being stripped of every thing that can induce a man
of any capacity to accept of it.-Allow me to make ano-
ther observation.  In respect to the poor, matters seem to
be very improperly conducted.  We are importuned by
people from almost every county in Scotland; whose sto-

poor would thereby be diminished; those who might still
need parochial supply, would be less indigent, and others
become able to bear a part of the burden of the unavoidably
