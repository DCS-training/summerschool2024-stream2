ter, have resorted to this district 3 d, That the greatest part
of the farmers younger sons have become tradesmen or
manufacturers: of course, they do not leave the parish, but
resort to the village; and, by marrying, soon add to the
number of souls.  It corroborates this opinion much, that
there are upwards of 900 souls in the old, and 300 in the
new town: whereas the country part of the parish is not
much more populous than it was last century: so that all
the increase of population is in the town.  Indeed it is cer-
tain, that it contains 300 souls more than it did even 10 years
ago; that is, before the new town was begun.  And as the
situation is highly advantageous-and the encouragement to
new settlers liberal, it must in all likelihood continue to in-
crease.  Especially, if a cotton miln, a bleachfield, printfield,
or any public work be established among us; in that case, the
increase must be rapid, and the population doubled in a very
short time.
   But in a statistical account, as little as possible should be left
to conjecture.  Therefore, without entering upon uncertain
ground, I shall give as full a table of births, or rather baptisms,
as I can.  And fortunately I have been enabled to collect the
materials for upwards of a century.
