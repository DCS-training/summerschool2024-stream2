Duke of Atholl, who had conceived a high opinion of his
abilities, was promoted to the rectorship.
   When he first went to Dunkeld, he entertained but an un-
favourable opinion of the Erfe language, which he consider-
ed as a barbarous gibberish:  But in order to investigate the
origin and descent of the ancient Scots, he applied to the
study of their primitive language.  Having, with his usual
affiduity, endeavoured to master its grammatical difficulties,
he set himself to discover something of its true genius and

an ordinary genius.  In this treatise, he proves, by the

But a fever put a period to his life, his labours and his use-

of his age.  He left, in manuscript, a much esteemed and
