ing in a regular course, always opening the oldest ground
first, and taking only three, or, if one of them be green,
four successive crops from the same field, and allowing
it afterwards to rest at least six years.  Except potatoes, few
green crops are raised here, chiefly owing to the want of pro-
per fences for preserving turnips or cabbages from the cat-
tle during winter; and also because the practice of hou-
sing cattle has not yet become general, and, of course,
such quantities of dung as these crops would require are not
collected.  Not above 10 or 12 acres of wheat are sown an-
nually; those sown with barley may exceed 100.  About a
third part of the lands, as it goes out, is sown down with rye
grass and clover feeds; and, if it has not been previously im-
poverished by over-cropping, the hay produced, both in point
of quantity and quality, is highly valuable.  The staple grain
is oats.  The small or grey oats have almost entirely given
place to the white oats, though they are still less pure, and of
an inferior quality to those raised in countries where improve-
ments have been longer introduced.  Of late, some farmers
have cultivated a species of black oats, which are sooner
ripe, and yield more meal, than any hitherto tried.  In ge-
neral, oats raised from ground improved with marle yield less
meal than those from ground improved with lime, because
the shell or hull of the former oats is thicker.  The marle,
however, is found to be the best manure for grass, and to be
peculiarly adapted to the soil of Galloway.  The farmers lay
their account with paying one term's rent out of the profits
of their crop, and the other out of those of their cattle.  Most
of the marle discovered in this parish has been exhausted.
The principal resource now is the loch  of Carlinwark, in the
parish of Kelton, which abundantly supplies the demands of
the country.  This loch was sold three years ago for L. 2000.
