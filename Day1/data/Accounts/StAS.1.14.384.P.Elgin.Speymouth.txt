     Statistical Account

draught for the plough in this parish is 2 horses of a
moderate size, with 4 oxen, or a mixture of oxen and
cows behind them; sometimes 2 horses with 2 oxen;
and some are now beginning to plough with 2 oxen on-
ly.  There are about 140 carts in the parish, almost all
of 1 horse draught; and this is found to be the most
convenient mode.
   There are 3 corn mills within the parish, to one or
other of which all the lands in the parish are astricted.
The multure, or the proportion paid for grinding the
corns, will be about an eleventh part of the quantity
ground.  The tenants are likewise bound to support the
mill-house and dam, and to carry the mill-stones.  It
were better that mills were generally laid open, and
that, instead of high multures and mill-services, a pro-
portionable additional rent were paid by the tenant to
the landlord directly.

   Extend of Forms, Rent of Lands, etc.-The farms in
this parish are generally of very small extent.  There are
about 6 from 60 to 80 acres in extent, and from 40 L. to
50 L. of rent, which employ 2 ploughs; about 3 or 4 from
40 to 50 acres, and from 20 L. to 3 L. rent; about 15, from
20 to 35 acres, and from 10 L. to 20 L. rent.  All the rest,
being nearly double the number of the former, are from
10 L. down to 5 L., or even 4 L. rent, and of a proportion-
able extent in acres; and most of these have a separate
plough.  The rent of the lands in the country part of
the parish, is from 15 s. to 5 s. the acre.  The average
will be very nearly 10 s. the acre on the whole.  The
lands belonging to the town of Garmouth, are let at from
20 s. to 30 s. the acre, and some small parts as high as
50 s: But the average will be about 25 s. the acre.  This
