   The increase since 1801 may be ascribed to the improvements
which have been made upon the land, and the influx of strangers into
the villages of Minnyhive and Dunreggan,--who have become
feuars.

There are residing in the villages of Minnyhive, Dunreggan, and Kirkland,     951

Number of acres cultivated or occasionally under tillage,                    7000
                which have never been cultivated,                           26600
                improvable,                                                  1000
                in tndivided common,                                            1
                under wood,                                                   800
   Rent of Land.--Of the 7000 acres of arable land, 2000 may
be estimated at L.1, 10s. per acre; 2000 acres at L.1 per acre;
and 3000 acres at 15s. per acre: total amount L.7250. Average
rent of grazing per ox, L.2 per annum; per cow, L.5; per ewe, 4s.
   Husbandry.--The mode of husbandry generally pursued is that
of the sixth and seventh rotations. The first crop is always oats;
second, potatoes or other green crop; third, generally barley;
fourth, rye-grass, to be cut for hay, then pastured from one to three
years. The improvement of which this appears susceptible, would
be--to cultivate fewer potatoes and more turnips, the same to be
eaten down with sheep, and also what rye-grass could be spared
from the horses,--the ground being generally of a light gravelly soil,
and consequently well adapted for that system of management.
   The only land in the parish that can be reclaimed with advan-
tage, is generally high and covered with heath, beat, or breckans;

<FOOTNOTE>The registering of births is sometimes neglected by the poorer classes.
