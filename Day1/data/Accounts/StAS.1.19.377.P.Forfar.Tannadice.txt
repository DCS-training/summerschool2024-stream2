used for paving streets.  A bed of this kind of stone is said
to extend to this parish, from the Milntown of Mather, a
place in the county of Kincardine, between Montrose and
John's-haven.  Slate, of the grey kind, is found in the Glen
of Ogil.
   Inundations are not frequent here.  About twenty years
ago, however, all the houses in the farm-town of Justing-
haugh were swept away by an inundation of the river Esk.
Since that time a good deal of money has been expended in
this quarter, in forming what are called beads, or angular
banks of stone, for keeping off the water on the north side
of the river.
   This parish boasts of no remarkable quadrupeds.  The land
is infested with foxes, and the water with otters.  Roes
sometimes come down from the hills, and lodge in the
woods; they are very common in the higher parts of the
parish.  There even the red deer abound.  Besides par-
tridge, grouse, the fieldfare, and other common birds, they
have one called the oswald, or oswat, very much resembling
a blackbird.  This, I suppose, is what the English call the
ousel, and describe as the very same with the blackbird.
What is here called the oswald, however, passes for a dif-
ferent species.  Various birds of passage make their ap-
pearance here, as wild geese, swallows, lapwings, woodcocks,
dottrels, etc.
   Many cattle are bred in this parish.  They are of an or-
dinary size.  An ox fully grown often weighs 40 or 50
stones.
   By reason of the parish being vacant, no exact account of
the population can be obtained.  By Dr Webster's account
in 1755, it amounted to 1470.  Fifty or sixty years ago
there were 400 communicants; now there are generally
between 500 and 600.  At an average, there are annually
15 births, and 8 or 9 deaths.  In the year 1794, however,
