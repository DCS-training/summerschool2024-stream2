able and willing to provide for its own poor; but the
people are greatly oppressed by ibundations of poor vagrants
from Ireland.  The great road from Portpatrick to Dam-
fries, passes through this parish, and is constantly swarming
with Irish bergars.  They turn aside into the country, and,
either by entreaties or by threats, extort alms from the in-
habitants.  They often go in crowds together, accompanied
generally with a number of young  children.  They may be
divided into two classes.  The first are those whole only ob-
ject is to beg their bread.  The second are those called
triggers, who carry on a species of traffic, unknown, I am
persuaded, in most places.  They bring linen from Ireland,
which they barter for the old woollen clothes of Scotland,
and these they prefer to gold or silver.  Bending under bur-
dens of these clothes, they return to their own kingdom.

   Character of the Inhabitants.-They are in general sober,
intelligent, social, and hospitable.  Their knowledge of agri-
culture, for these last twenty years, is much enlarged, and
their habits of life much improved.

   Diseases, etc.-The parish is situated between Lochryan
and the bay of Luce, and enjoys a mild and healthy climate.
Epidemical distempers are seldom known here; rheumatisms,
however, are frequent.  But, upon the whole, the inhabi-
tants enjoy much health, and live to a good old age.  There
are about 30 persons in the parish above 80 years of age, two
95, and one who says he is 105.

   Heritors.-There are seven heritors in the parish, of
whom the Earl of Stair is the only residing one.
