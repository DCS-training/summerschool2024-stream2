North of Scotland, for hardiness, skill, and industry, though
their distance from the main ocean subjects them to many
inconveniences.
   From the beginning of October to the middle of March,
they commonly fish for herrings in these upper parts of the
Frith.  Towards the end of March and in April, they go
down along the coasts of Moray and Caithness, for cod,
skate, and haddocks.  In May and June, some of them are
engaged by the Northumberland Fishing company to catch
lobsters for the London market, on the shores of Easter
Ross, about Farbat-point.  The others, during those months,
work at the haddock fishing, to supply the towns of Inverness
and Fortrose, and the Western part of the Black Isle.  A-
bout the middle of July, all the able fishermen here go off
to Caithness, and Lochbroom, for six or eight weeks, when
the herring fishery at those stations is commonly most fa-
vourable; and in good years they have been known to bring
home from thence, 8 L. or 10 L. Sterling each man of nett
gain.
   They generally return in September, to prepare for the
season at home, which, owing to the small depth, and clear-
ness of this frith, begins only about the autumnal equinox;
or a fortnight thereafter.  The same causes oblige the fisher-
men, for the most part, to delay their work here till evening or
night, as the herrings are then caught in much greater num-
bers, than during the day.  In good seasons, it is not un-
common for each boat to bring in the quantity, of from 18
to 25 barrels in one night.  When the shoal comes up in
the end of June or beginning of July, the herrings prove ge-
nerally best, and most plentiful.
   In winter 1786-7, besides those used at home, five or six
thousand barrels were cured here for exportation; and seve-
