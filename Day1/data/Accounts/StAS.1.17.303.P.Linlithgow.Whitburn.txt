Another circumstance farther increased the dissatisfaction of
some of the smaller heritors, and their inclination to secede.
They imagined, that the rent of certain lands in the parish
of Shotts, which had been purchased with the subscription
money, was to be all the maintenance to which their mini-
ster was to be entitled: But this turned out to be by no
means the case; for a few months after the decrect of pa-
tronage by the House of Lords, tile minister was preferred
to 28 L. 6 s. 8 d. additional stipend, out of the teinds of the
parish, by the Lords Commissioners of teinds for Scotland.
The chagrin occasioned by these two circumstances conti-

in the parish, can talk with any degree of patience of patro-

   Sir William Augustus Cunningham, Bart. is patron of the
parish.  The present incumbent, Mr James Rhind, was ad-
mitted minister of Whiteburn in 1790.  His only predeces-
sors were Mr Alexander Wardrobe, deceased; Dr Porteous
of Glasgow; Professor Baron of St. Andrews; and Mr
Sommerville of Stirling, to the last of whom he succeeded.
He has been married about twelve months, and has one child.
His income is 125 L. of stipend, and 3 L. 6 s. 8 d. of com-
munion elements, which, with the manse and glebe, may be
estimated in all at 140 L. per annum.  Of the stipend, 100 L.
arises from a feu of two farms in the parish of Shotts; and
the remainder is the augmented stipend.  The church is a
good, large building; but stands much in need of being re-
paired.  The manse is an old, but tolerably good, house, and
in decent repair.

   Poor.-The number of poor upon the parish roll is usually
about 10.  They are maintained, at present, by the col-
lections in the church, and by a voluntary subscription over
the parish, which are distributed by the session, under the
