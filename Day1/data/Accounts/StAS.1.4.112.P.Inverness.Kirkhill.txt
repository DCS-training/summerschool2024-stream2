parish of Kilterlity, on the N. by the parishes of Kilmo-
rack, Urray and Kilternan, being separated from the three
last mentioned, by the river Beuly and the Moray frith.
It is situated within the county of Inverness, in the presby-
tery of Inverness and Synod of Moray. For 4 miles it
is a narrow strip, on the declivity of a hill, inclining to the
Moray frith, with a N. W. aspect.  Beyond these 4 miles
the frith contracts and the country enlarges; but instead of
forming a plain, a ridge of rising ground projects into the
plain, which divides it into two valleys; the summit of this
ridge is Wardlaw of Mary's hill.  The soil is various.
In the two valleys and along the frith, that part of the
land which connects the two valleys, the soil is a strong
rich clay, which by proper culture might be made very
fruitful; for such parts of it, as have been well cultivated,
produce equal, perhaps, to any soil in Scotland; but when
ill managed, the crop is precatious.  If the beginning of
the season is very dry, the clay binds to fast as to stint the
growth of the corn; if, on the other hand, the season is
wet, the coldness of the clay chills the feed.  On the rising
ground next the plain, the soil is a rich loam, which com-
monly yields a good and sure crop.  Higher still, the soil
is light on a gravelly bottom, but sharp, and in good sea-
sons produce a tolerables crop.
