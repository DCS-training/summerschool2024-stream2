     Statistical Accounty

   There are 4 free-stone quarries in this parish; 2 of which
are upon these farms called Hattonburn farms, belonging
to Mr Stein of Hattonburn:  the other 2 are in the ea-
stern part of the parish.  The stones of these quarries are
of a grey and whitish colour, something resembling the
Craigleith, near Edinburgh, or those of the Portland stones,
in England.  They are exceedingly good for building, either
in rouble or in ashler.  The houses built in Millnathort, of
these quarries, have an elegant, light, and cheerful appear-
ance.

   Roads and Plantations.-There are 2 excellent roads that
run through this parish :  the one, leading from Perth to the
North Ferry, is constantly kept in the best repair; the
other, leading from Stirling to Kinrofs, strikes off from the
main turnpike at the bridge of Queegh, is naturally laid
with channel, and is always good without much repair.
There is little planting in this parish, as yet, come to any
maturity; the only planting worth while of mentioning, i.
that in the eastern part of the parish, which surrounds the
Castle of Burleigh, the trees of which are very large, and
so old, as that many of them are grown boss or hollow.  This
planting, with the castle, belongs to Mr Graham of Kinrofs.

   Rivulets, Bridges, and Mills.-Only 2 rivulets glide thro'
this parish; the largest of which is called the Queegh, co-
ming from the west, and terminating in Loch Leven.  This
rivulet, upon an average, may be about 20 feet over, and di-
vides this parish from Kinrofs on the south, over which
there is a good stone-bridge, on the great turnpike-road
from the Ferry to Perth.  The other rivulet runs through
the village of Millnathort, and serves the inhabitants with
water; it is over this rivulet that the village of Millnahort,
with the mills, are situated, which gave rise to the name of
