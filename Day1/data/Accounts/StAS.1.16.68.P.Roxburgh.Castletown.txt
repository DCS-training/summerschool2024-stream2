<FOOTNOTE>

*With regard to marriages and baptisms, the parish register is very
imperfect.  Several books have been lost, which make blanks of conside-
rable periods.  There is a minute inserted in the session records of date
17th January 1649, which mentions, "That the English army, com-
"manded by Colonels Bright and Pride, and under the conduct of Ge-
"neral Cromwell, on their return to England, did lie at the kuk of
"Castletown several nights, in which time they brake down and burnt
"the communion tables, and the seats of the kirk; and at their remo-
"ving, carried away the minister's books to the value of 1000 marks
"and above, and also the books of session, with which they lighted their
"tobacco pipes, the baptism, marriage, and examination rolls, from
"October 1612 to September 1648, all which were lost and destroyed."
From the accuracy with which this record had been kept, the loss of it is
very much to be regretted.  If we may form any judgment from the
number of churches and chapels in the parish at that time with the
burying grounds, and also from the ruins of many houses and villages,
the number of the inhabitants must have been much greater at that pe-
riod than at present.  No account of the burials can now be given be-
cause there are three burying grounds still used, and a mortclot the
property of private individuals, and not belonging to the kirk-sesion.
