Upon the Ross side of the sound of I, there are two
creeks, the one called the Barachan, and the other Poll-
tairve or the Bull pond, were vessels of considerable
burden may anchor in great safety, with proper pilots.
There is a sand bank in the sound of I, near mid channel,
so that vessels passing through it, must keep within one
third channel of the island of I.  Loch-lahich lies E. of
the Sound of I, at the distance of about 3 miles.  An
island, or rock, at the entrance, must be kept by a ves-
sel entering the loch upon the starboard quarter; but 
with a leading wind a vessel may safely enter between
this small island and the Ross land on the W., as this
channel, though narrow, is deep, and free of rocks.  After
entering the loch, a small island at the bottom of it must
be kept upon the larboard.  Between this island and the 
main land, vessels, in general, anchor, though there is no
danger in anchoring in any part of the loch.  This loch
runs about 2 miles from N. to S. into Ross, and is one
of the safest anchorage about the island of Mull.  A
small arm of it running W., and called Lochcoal, is too
shallow for any vessel to anchor in.  The whole of Loch-
seridain may be called a road, but the best anchoring
ground is at Kilsinichen, and another place at the heads
of the loch, called the narrows, were vessels may ride
in safety from all storms.  The head land of Burg in
Airdmeanach, and the whole of the north coast of the
same district, is very dangerous.  The coast is bold, full
of rocks, and no harbour.

   Fish and Fisheries.-Great sholes of various kinds of
fish surround all the coast of the parish; such as her-
rings,cod ling, mackarel, laith, codling, seth, girnot,
rock-fish, or sea-parch, etc.  Of flat fish, there are sloun-
