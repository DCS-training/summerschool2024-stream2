sociation, for the best cultivated farm in the county, was gained by
the tenant of Bethelnie in this parish.  A considerable proportion
of land has been substantially enclosed with stone dikes.  On
some of the largest farms, there are enclosures of hawthorn hedges;
and several fields in the vicinity of Old Meldrum, have, within
these few years, been surrounded with a double row of hedging,
consisting of beech and hawthorn, which has advanced with great
rapidity, and is now very ornamental as well as useful.
   The crops raised are, oats, bear or big, turnips, potatoes, and
a small proportion of wheat and barley.  In the vicinity of Old
Meldrum, all the varieties of turnip seeds are raised of a superior
quality; and the character of them is so well established, that some
of the most celebrated agriculturists, both in England and Scotland,
have, for several years past, supplied themselves from this quarter.

   Manufactures.-The knitting of worsted, stockings is still much
practised by females in Old Meldrum, although at a much redu-
ced rate of remuneration.  There are two pretty extensive weaving
shops in Old Meldrum, rented by the proprietors of some of the
large manufacturing establishments in Aberdeen, in which a con-
siderable number of young persons of both sexes are employed at
the hand-loom.  Their wages have fallen very much of late years.
   Since the act of Parliament was passed in 1823, two distille-
ries, upon a small scale, have been set to work, one of them in Old
Meldrum, and one on the estaeb of Tullo; in the former place,
there is a long established brewery.

the winter and spring months, there is a market every fortnight for
the sale of cattle and grain; and there are two annual fairs in the
months of May and November, at which farm-servants are engag-
