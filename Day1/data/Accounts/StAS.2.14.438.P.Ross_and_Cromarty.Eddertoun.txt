the sides of the neighbouring gneiss hills; the upper part gradu-
ating into caleareo-bituminous slates, and the lower part compos-
ed of the debris of the neighbouring primary rocks, and generally
resting unconformably upon them.  The aggregate thickness of
these deposits is enormous, and their original extent was probably
much greater than at present, as it perhaps once filled up a great
hollow or trough of the primary rocks.  At Meikle Daan, and in
other places, are quarries of freestone, which are neither easily
hewn nor durable, from being much impregnated with iron ore.
At Daan there is also a bed of limestone of a hard kind, which
has been occasionally burnt for lime, but was found to be rather
expensive under ordinary management.  The whole of the deeper
mosses, especially in the heights of the parish, contain, as in al-
most all the Highlands, trunks and roots of trees, chiefly fir, but
also oak, hazel, birch, &c.  Some of these are of immense size, in-
dicating the existence of an extensive forest at some period, though
probably a very remote one.
  Soil.-The soil is various, according to locality, as already stated.
in the division nearer the sea, the higher parts are gravelly; next
comes deep alluvial loam; and the lowest turris quite sandy.  The
middle division is chiefly gravelly and mossy, with a mixture of clay,
and common soil.  The highest is also a varied mixture of clay,
gravel, moss, and common soil, but is deeper and more easily cul-
tivated than the middle division of the parish.  Cultivation has done
very much for this parish within the last forty years, so that the
general aspect is quite changed; much, however, still remains to
be done.  The principal land-owner, Sir Charles Ross of BaIna-
gown, has been liberal and encouraging to the large farmers on
his estate; and is giving considerable quantities of lime to the
smaller tenants according to the extent and quality of the lands
they occupy.  Such Judicious liberality and kindness, benefiting as
it does all parties, is worthy alike of commendation and imitation.
