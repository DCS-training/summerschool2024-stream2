in general, were consequently poor, rents were ill paid, and
sometimes not at all.  The family of Breadalbane, who were
superiors of the country, adopted very wise plans for its im-
provement.  A Sheriff-substitute was got to Killin for set-
tling differences; a check was given to knavery; the sober
and industrious among the people were supported and en-
couraged; and the turbulent and irregular expelled the coun-
try to which they were so much attached, that it was rec-
koned no small punishment by them.  These means, toge-
ther with the happy change in the times, have had very
good effects.  The people of Breadalbane are now sober, re-
gular, and industrious.  They are, in general, rather in easy
than affluent circumstances  They pay their rents punctual-
ly, and live comfortably.  Most of the farms in the lower
parts of the parish are divided among several tenants.  The
arable and pasture ground being separated, each has his own
division of the arable, and their cattle feed in common in the
pasture ground  In this manner they live harmoniously to-
gether; and possessions descend, particularly on the Breadal-
bane estate, from father to son.  Gaelic is the language gene-
rally spoken in the country; but most of the younger people
understand less or more of the English language, and can
converse in it.  They make a practice, when young, of go-
ing for several years to serve in the low country, principally
for the purpose of learning the English language.  The ge-
nerality of the people are lively and intelligent, without be-
ing turbulent, have a competent share of knowledge, and at-
tend religious ordinances regularly, and with great decorum.
Scarcity of fuel, and distance from markets, are the principal
disadvantages to which this parish is subject; but the last of
these disadvantages is row greatly alleviated by the goodness
of the roads leading into it, and passing through it.
