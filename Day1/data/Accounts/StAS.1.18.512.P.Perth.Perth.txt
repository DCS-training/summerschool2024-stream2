   An extensive commerce was carried on, during many ages,
between Perth and the Netherlands.  The merchants of Perth
visited in their own ships, the Hanse towns.  And it is a part
of the eulogium conserred on Alexander III. who died in
1286, that he devised successful measures for securing the
trading ships of the nation, " against Pirates, and against
"being detained on flight pretences in any of the foreign ports.
"In consequence of the care which he exercised about the
"trade of the kingdom, which for some years, during his
"minority, had been on the decline; multitudes of ships
"soon came from diverse regions, loaded with goods of va-
"rious kinds, to be exchanged for the commodities of this
"country." (Forduns vol. ii. p 130.)
   The German merchants, or Flemings as they were called,
very early frequented the port of Perth.  And not a few in-
dustrious Germans, who wrought in the woollen and linen
manufactories, and in staining of cloth, seem to have fixed
their abode at Perth, and to have been received as burgesses.
   But King William the Lion, following the example of his
grandfather King David, put the foreign merchants under a
great restriction when they came to Perth with their goods,
in a charter which he gave to the town, in the year 1210.
And, in that same charter, as a farther discouragement, he
granted to his burgesses of Perth, " that they might have
"their own merchant gild, fullers and weavers excepted."
   What seems to have been the political reason of the excep-
tion of these two trades, viz. the apprehension of an inunda-
tion of foreigners, has long since ceased to exist.  The ful-
lers have been admitted members of the Guildry.  The wea-
vers have their own incorporation, and the Legislature, so far
from being apprehensive of the consequences formerly dread-
ed, has of late years, for the encouragement of manufactures,
allowed that weavers may exercise their trade freely in all
