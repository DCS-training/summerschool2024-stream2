     of Aboyne and Glentanar.

   Situation, Extent, etc.-These parishes are situated in
the county and synod of Aberdeen, and presbytery of Kin-
cardine.  The church is 30 English miles south-west
from Aberdeen, and nearly the same distance north west
from Brechin.  The cultivated part of these parishes ex-
tends four miles from east to west, and three miles from
north to south; but the hills of Glentanar extend five miles
farther to the south-west.  The river Dee is generally the
boundary between the two parishes, Glentanar lying on the
south, and Aboyne on the north of that river.  Only the
lands of Balnacraig, and two insulated farms in the parish
of Aboyne, surrounded on all sides by the parish of Birse,
are situated on the south bank of the Dee.  The parish of
Lochlee, in the county of Angus, whose church is above 16
miles from that of Aboyne, bounds this parish on the south-
west.  In the county of Aberdeen it is bounded by the pa-
rishes of Glenmuick, Tullich, Coul, Coldstone, Logie, Kin-
cardine, and Birse.

   Ancient Division of the County.-The different hills which
nature has marked out as barriers, were the ancient boun-
daries of counties and districts.  In modern times, the di-
vision by rivers has gained ground.  But in there parishes
the county of Aberdeen crosses the river Dee, and follows
the division by hills; and in this district, the ideas of a High-
lander still favour the division by hills and mountains.  The
people uniformly call all that extent of ground which is
bounded by the sensible horizon by the name of a country.

   Mountains.-The parish of Aboyne has no considerable
hills.  Glentanar is altogether hilly, and approaches to
mountainous.  The highest mountain of Glentanar, called
the Fir Month, is about 2500 feet above the level of the sea;
and commands a prospect of Aberdeen, Montrose, and Ar-
