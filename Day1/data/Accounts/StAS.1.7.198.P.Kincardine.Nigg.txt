up the Dee.  If this experiment is a certain indication, is
what condition must this country have once been?

   Climate and Diseases.-The air is healthy; Along the coast
it is fresh, and, from the influence of the sea, to the sense
colder; yet the frost is less intense, snow continues shorter
time, and the crop ripens sooner than in places a little inland.
The east wind brings a moisture, and sometimes, particularly
in the month of May, mists come off the sea; but the cli-
mate cannot be called damp; rather, from the moderate
quantity of rain which falls upon this east coast, perhaps a-
bout 27 inches annually, from the light, loamy, sandy soil,
absorbing it soon, and from the frequent breezes, it may be
reckoned dry.  This allows grain to be sown pretty early;
oats, from the middle of march, and bear, from the middle
of April; potatoes are planted in April; turnip is sown from
the beginning of June.  The crop ripens in general soon.
In this sea air, iron is soon corroded.  It brings also on the
surface of many bodies, especially in a northern and eastern
exposure, a fog, or green species of moss.  To the growth
of timber and fruit it rectus unfavourable, at least till shel-
ter be acquired.  No diseases of an epidemic nature prevail
here, except brought by contagion.  Agues are unknown.
The small-pox, for which inoculation is not used, once
in a few years spreads, especially among the fisher families,
whose communication with one another is open, and carries
off sometimes many children.  From the more sedentary
life of women now, at knitting stockings, hysteric complaints
are thought frequent.  The inhabitants live to a moderate
age.  The fishermen are very little subject to diseases through
mid-life; but exposed, from their occupation, to disasters.
Of 30 men in boats at the Cove, within 3 years 9 have pe-
