rent, L. 800 Sterling; valued rent, L. 160 Scots.  Mr Far-
quharson has a house here, and has inclosed much of his
arable land with stone dikes, as Mr Stewart has likewise
done; whin or moor stones having at first been plentiful on
the grounds.  Cally is possessed by one proprietor, Mr
Macdonald; rent, L 91 Sterling; valued rent, L. 228, 17 s.
Scots.  The cultivated part of Cally is a level spot on the
left back of the Ardle.  It is rather lower ground, and
drier than Persy, but uninclosed.  Floods of the rivers do
no damage to the grounds or corns in these parts, as they
never reach so high.  There is a large hill or ridge between
Persy and Cally, uncultivated, and level at top, being a
continuation of the hilly ground adjacent, and having nearly
the same elevation with other high grounds in the neigh-
hourhood.  These high grounds seem to have been the
original surface of the country; the above cultivated parts
among the Grampians having been scooped out by bodies
of water running in these beds.  Persy, Cally, and Drim-
mie, belonged of old to the monks of Cupar Angus: Cal-
ly, for this reason, was named Monk's Cally.  The insu-
lated part at Drimmie is chiefly a steep ridge on the left
bank of the Eroch, and running parallel thereto, on the
N. side of which ridge there is a hollow, and then again a
second ascent.  This estate is either cultivated or inclosed
pasture.  The fences are of moor-stone.  Much of the soil
is wet mortar.  It is better soil near the river, where Mr
Murison, the proprietor, has a lodge.  Rent, L. 160 Ster-
ling; valued rent, L. 508: 13: 4 Scots.  Drimmie pays no
stipend to the minister.
   The real rent of the whole parish, as above, is L. 2467
Sterling.  The valued rent in the cess books, L. 6045, 14 s.
Scots.
