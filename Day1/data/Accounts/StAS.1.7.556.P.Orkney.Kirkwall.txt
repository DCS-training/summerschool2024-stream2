and turf, which are procured from mosses at about 2 or 3
miles distance.  Every cart-load of peats, and the carts are
very small, costs 9 d. the horse-load a penny; and, to furnish
this article to an ordinary family, whose income may be about
50 L. per annum, it will require fully 5 L. Sterling.  As this
necessary of life, as well as almost every other, has increased
very much of late, some people have begun to use coal, car-
ried from the Clyde, from the Forth, and from Tyne; and,
though there be imposed on it a pretty high duty, the most

   Wages.-To support a man, with a wife and four children,
through the year, it would require at least 10 L. and perhaps
11 L. or 12 L.; and all that he is able, by his industry in

The wages of servants employed in husbandry, and maintain-
ed in houses, are, for men, 2 L. 10 s. and for women, not
above 15 s.  Domestic servants, though not more usefully
employed, are much better rewarded; for the men that serve
in that capacity receive no less than about 5 L. and the wo-
men 20 s. Sterling.

   Antiquities.-Through several parts of this parish, as well
as almost every other in the country, there are to be met
with a kind of ruins, many of them of a very large size, and
all of them situated in some pleasant spot by the sea-shore,
commonly three, or at least two of them, within view of,
and at no great distance from each other.  They are uni-
versally known here by the name of Picts houses.  Such of
them as we have seen and examined are of a circular form;
and, when measured as near to the foundation as could be
reached, they have been found to be from 100 to about 50
