but only one of them resides, viz. Sir William Jardine of Ap-
plegarth, Bart. who has the molt considerable property in it.

at between 2800 L. and 3000 L. Sterling; but the proprietors
are not all willing to disclose the amount of their rents.

   Population.-The number of inhabitants, in the parish, have
greatly decreased within the last 15 years, owing to the pro-
prietors of the lands, having conjoined a number of small
farms together, and let them to one tenant.  The males and
females born in the parish are nearly equal.  For the space of
15 years, there has been only eight more males born than
females.  This, however, cannot be exactly ascertained, for
the Secoders seldom enter the names of their children in the
register.  The following table exhibits the ancient and pre-
lent state of the population:
