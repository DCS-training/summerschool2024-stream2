the coast of the island abounds. It is allowed that this
island is a fifth or sixth part value of the yearly rent of the
whole farm of Oldney.

   Cronay Island.-This is a little flat island, also adjoined to
Oldhey farm; it lies in that pretty large bosom of sea,
which, from the point of Row-store, leads to the anchoring
ground of Cul-ch ig, south side of Doruy-Oldney.  It is
