the coast, produces not, in general, any tolerable crop of
that grain.  Fallowing is not practised here, except on the
few inclosed farms already alluded to.  Scarce any land is
plowed in autumn, and but little in winter; the prevailing
opinion being, that early plowing or sowing, answers not
with the light and open nature of the soil.  Some small
tenants, on the coast, sow no bear till about the 20th
of May; and they are satisfied if but three weeks intervene
betwixt the first and second plowings.  In light soil, pease
are sown before tilling, and then turned down by the plough;
which seems to answer best, as by that mode, the scorching
impressions of the sun and wind are most effectually resisted,
and a greater degree of moisture preserved around the seed.
Even bear is sometimes sown here in the same manner.  This
is the most extensively cultivated parish in the country, yet
there is not an eight part of it in culture.  It raises not, in
ordinary seasons, much more corn than is sufficient for its in-
habitants, including those of the burgh.  More black cattle,
however, are reared here, than the parish requires for the
purposes of meat and labour; but not so many horses as the
people employ.  A few hogs are reared.  In the lower parts
of the parish there is little sheep pasture:  in the hilly districts,
flocks of these, and here and there, of goats, are kept; but
neither considerable.  The ardour for sheep farming has hardly
yet commenced here.  The precise proportions of land, in cul-
ture, pasture, etc. is not ascertained.  The quantity of pasture
grounds has been considerably reduced or destroyed:  the
former, by the gradual culture of small settlers; and the
latter, by the general practice of cutting seal and divot, or
turf*.
