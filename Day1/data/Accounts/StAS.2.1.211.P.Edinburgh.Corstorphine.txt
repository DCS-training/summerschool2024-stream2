relict of Sir John Stewart of Jedworth.  He died in 1440, and
was buried in the chancel of the collegiate church.
   Sir John Forrester, his eldest son, seems to have been better
fitted for the field of battle than for the cabinet, and does not ap-
pear to have held any civil appointment. He took part with the
Earls of Douglas in their struggles with the Chancellor Crich-
ton and Livingston, and led the troops which besieged and demo-
lished Brankston Castle in 1446.  His sasine in the estate of Cor-
storphine is dated 15tb September 1436; be was also buried in
the chancel of the collegiate church, and the stone figure above
his grave represents a man of Herculean mould.
   Sir Alexander Forrester, the next proprietor of Corstorphine,
appears to have been strongly actuated by the superstition of the
age in which be lived, for he led two separate pilgrimages to the
shrines of Thomas a Becket at Canterbury, and John de Amyace
in Picardie,--the former in 1464, and the latter in 1466.  On
both occasions, be was accompanied by Sir John Lauder of Hal-
ton and several other of the neighbouring proprietors, and they
took with them thirty followers.*
   Archibald Forrester, his son, was infeft, in Corstorphine on 20th
February 1467, and is mentioned as present in Parliament on 7th
January 1504-5; his son,
Alexander Forrester, obtained a charter under the Great Seat
to the Barony of Corstorphine on 12th September 1533.
   James Forrester got Meadowfield from his father on 13th Ja-
nuary 1538, and afterwards succeeded to the rest of the Barony
of dorstorphine.
   Sir James Forrester was very young when his father died and
was served heir to him in February 1547.  Besides the Barony of
Corstorphine, he had the lands of Nether Bernton, Thirleston, and
Lowriston; he died in 1589 without leaving any issue, and was
succeeded by his only brother,
   Henry Forrester, who took possession of Corstorphine on 8th
November 1589. On 23d June 1607, he resigned the Barony of
Corstorphine in favour of his son,
   George Forrester, who obtained a Crown charter in his own
favour on 15th November 1607.  He was made a Baronet in
1625, and a Peer on 11tb July 1633, under the title of Lord,
Forrester of Corstorphine.  He was an elder of the parish, for
many years, and attended most faithfully to the duties of
