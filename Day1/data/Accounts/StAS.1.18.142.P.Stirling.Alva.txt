     Statistical Account

   About the year 1759, the late Charles Erskine, Lord Jus-
tice Clerk, father of Lord Alva, having a few years before,
purchased this barony from his nephew, the late Sir Henry
Erskine, revived the working of the silver mines in this place.
A company consisting of some gentlemen, kinsmen and friends
of the family, was formed, and a moderate capital subscrib-
ed.  These carried on the work, with considerable industry;
they pursued the course of the vein, where the silver ore had
been found, a very great way beyond the old workings,
which had for many years been abandoned.  Their success,
it must be regretted, was not in proportion to the vigour of
their exertions; for although the appearances in the vein
were favourable, and small strings of metal sometimes disco-
vered, these however were not followed by any thing of suf-
ficient importance, to encourage, them to continue their re-
searches.
   A shaft or sump, as the miners term it, was made to the
depth of several fathoms, immediately below the bottom of
the waste from whence the rich mass of ore, above men-
tioned, had been taken, and a drift carried on, in the direc-
tion of the silver vein, upon that level; but neither did this
attempt answer the expectation which had been formed of its
success.  To facilitate these operations however, it had been
resolved, to drive a level at a considerable distance, nearer
the bottom of the hill; for the purpose of draining the water
from the works above.  In executing this part of their scheme,
they had not advanced a great way into the side of the hill,
when a large mass of ore was discovered; at first, this was
imagined to be silver; but upon an accurate trial, made by a
gentleman, distinguished for his chemical knowledge, it was
discovered to be cobalt.  A very considerable quantity of this
was brought out, of which a great part was used in a manu-
facture of porcelain, that had been erected much about that
