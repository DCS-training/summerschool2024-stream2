have been thought a species of idolatry, to dedicate a church
to any but God.  The origin of this name, therefore, as a
name of the church or parish, may not implausibly be at-
tributed to some of the dark ages, the tenth, eleventh, or
twelfth century.
   The extent of the parish, in point of territory, is not
great, being confined to the bounds of the city on every
side, except the south-east, where it extends to the mouth
of the river, and includes a small fishing village called Fut-
tie, (or Footdee, as some of late affect to spell it from a mi-

Aberdeen and the sea, and is the only village in the parish.
In other directions, even what may be called the suburbs
of the town, are not in the parish.-As to the form, though

other we can think of.  In this view we reckon the quay,
and that part of the street which leads from the west end
of the quay to the Bow-bridge, (which is the lowest and
most southerly part of the down), the base of the triangle:
the angle subtended, which makes the top of the triangle,
and is the highest part of the town, is at the Gallowgate-

length of the parish, reckoning from the lower dwelling-
house upon the Dee, next the block-house, to the most
northern house in Causey-end, is about two English miles.
The breadth, reckoning from Sommer's house eastward,
behind North-street, to the Infirmary, which is in the most
western part of the town, about one mile.-It is bounded
on the south by the parish of Nigg, from which it is sepa-

sea; on the north and west, quite round from the sea to the
river, it is bounded by the parish of Old Machar, or Old.
