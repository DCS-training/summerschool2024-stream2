kind, such as commonly insest dry lands, but never thrive
in water. 
   As to grain and other crops, it appears from several
circumstances, that wheat was cultivated long ago to a
considerable extent.  The culture of it was revived about
10 or 12 years since; when, after a very fair trial by a
number of hands, it was entirely given up as unprofitable.
It was found to ripen late and to impoverish the soil.
Oats, barley, and a few  hasting pease, are the only kinds
of grain raises at present.  About 20 acres may be em-
ployed in the culture of flax.  Turnip and potatoes are
raised on every farm, as are also clover and rye-grass.
Some yams have been planted within these few years,
and the farmers seem to approve of them.
   Of forest-tress the ash, fir, elm and beech, thrive well.
Oaks of a large size have been dug up in some mossy parts
of the plain, and some that have been planted of late are
sufficiently forward.  Fruit-trees grow much to wood,
and it must be owned difficult to raise fruit:  The dif-
ficulty however is sensibly decreasing, both the air and
soil becoming more kindly by draining and planting the
latter, particularly on the east.
   The number of horses is about 200, about one third of
which may be reared in the parish.  Black cattle being
used in labour now, there are about 30 kept for that pur-
pose; cows about 300.  With regard to sheep, it is re-
markable, that about 25 years ago there were 12 small
flocks in the kind, save a few kept by a gentlemam mostly
for the use of his own family.  They were found destruc-
tive to the sown grass, and liable to perish for want of pro-
per shelter.  Young black cattle have been, with great ad-
vantage, put in their place.
