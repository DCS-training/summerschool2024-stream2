10 o'clock, on the days of new and full moon, and in the
harbour of Stromness at 9 o'clock.  The flood sets from
the N. W.  An hour before flood is perceived in the chan-
nel of Hoy Sound, a stream sets from the north, along the
west coasts of these parishes, keeping this side of the Sound,
and continues in this direction; at half ebb another stream
sets from the south, along the south side of the Sound, and
continues till high water.  These streams, when known and
attended to, help to facilitate the entrance of shipping into
the harbour of Stromness.  This harbour lies at the south
or south-east extremity of the parish.  The entry to it is
from the south, and is about a quarter of a mile broad.
There is a sand bank at the entry, on the west side, which
is not dangerous.  Two small islands or holms lie on the
east side of the harbour.  It is well sheltered from the west
and north winds, by a hill that rises above the village of
Stromness, and stretches along the harbour on that side.
There can be no sea in this harbour with the north-east
winds, as it is land-locked on that side, and the violence of
the sea, with southerly winds, is broken by Hoy and other
islands, which fence it from the seas that lead from the
German Ocean into the Pentland Frith.  It affords safe
anchorage, although the ground has become rather oozy,
from being much ploughed.  The streams which run into
it, carrying mud along with them, have made it more shal-
low than formerly it was.  There is little or no tide in it.
It is not a mile long, and not half a mile in breadth.  Ves-
sels of 1000 tons burden may anchor in it.  A ship of war
of 40 guns has anchored here, and had sufficient depth of
water.  Although it is small, this is one of the safest har-
bours to be found along the north coast of Britain, being
sheltered by high lands on the one side, and on the other
side by islands:
