with heath, and some large peat mosses which supply the in-
habitants with fuel.  There are now no open undivided
commons; but there is, in the lower part of the parish, a
considerable extent of ground still lying unimproved.  In the
estate of Kirkmichael and the barony of Ross; and in two
other small properties, besides plantations, there may be 150,
or nearly 200 acres of natural wood.  There is much marthy
ground, which, if properly drained and cultivated, might turn
to good account.

   Soil and Produce.-The soil on the sides of the river Ae in
the west, south, and south-east part of the parish is very fer-
tile, producing wheat, oats, and barley in great plenty
the middle parts are mostly dry and gravelly; but produce
oats, barley, and pease tolerably well; the east side, especial-
ly by the side of the river Kinnell, is very fertile.  In ordina-
ry years, between 6 and 10 thousand stones of oat meal are
sold out of the parish after the inhabitants have been suppli-
ed.  In the remarkable years 1782 and 1783, the crops
were not only sufficient for the demands of the inhabitants,
but allowed a considerable quantity to be sold in the ad-
jacent parishes.  For the last thirty four years, no crop was to
bad as not to furnish the inhabitants with provision, and
leave a great quantity for the market.  The reason of this
steady fertility seems to be the effects of the depth and mois-
ture of the soil, which circumstances, though they may re-
tard the harvest eight or ten days later than in the parishes
immediately south of it, render the ground less liable to be
hurt in dry seasons.  Flax; hemp, and grass, are rarely sown
in the parish.  The fowing season here usually begins about
the 10th of March; and in good years, the harvest is con-
cluded about the 1st week of October; but this year having
