years.  The enclosures are either stone dikes, ditch and
hedge, or hedges with a small stone dike, two, or two feet
and a half in height, behind them.  This last mode of en-
closing has been only adopted of late, but is much appro-
ved of.  There are many stripes of planting and clumps of
trees, not only round the seats of the gentlemen in the 
parish, but in different quarters of it, which both afford
much shelter, and greatly adorn te face of the country.

   Soil, Cultivation and Produce.-The soil of this parish
is, in general, rich, fertile, and well cultivated, producing
large crops of all the different grains sown in Scotland, as
wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans.  No hemp is raised,
and the quantity of flax is inconsiderable, being only for
private use.  Turnips are cultivated, but not to a great
extent, as the farmers reckon the ground to be in general
too strong and wet for that useful plant, and on that ac-
count commonly prefer sowing wheat upon their sallows.
Potatoes are raised in considerable quantities, and, during
the winter, form a principal part of the food of the poorer
classes of the people.  A large extent of ground is al-
ways in pasture; but the quantity cannot be ascertained,
as the farmers are constantly employed in plowing up
some fields, and sowing others with grass seeds.  A good
deal of red clover is also sown annually, for the support of
the working horses, as, during summer, they are generally
fed in houses with cut grass.  the four different kinds of
grain above mentioned, (reckoning pease and beans as
one,) are sown in nearly equal quantities.  The proportion
of barley has, of late, been the least.  Beans were intro-
duced here only about 30 years ago, but, where the soil
will admit of it, are now generally substituted instead of
pease.  They answer equally well, either on strong clay
or light loam, but can never be sown with advantage,
