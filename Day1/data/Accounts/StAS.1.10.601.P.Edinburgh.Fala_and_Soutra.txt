   Climate, Moss, Fuel, etc.-The air is sharp, but salubrious.
It is sometimes, however, loaded with fogs, owing to the im-
mediate vicinity of Soutra-hill and Fala-muir, which is ex-
tensive and wet.  In this muir there is a small piece of water,
called the Flow, which also gives its name to a good part of
the marshy grounds, lying to the south and west of it.  Of
this moss, which contains some hundreds of acres, no use is
at present made, but digging of peats for the small village of
Fala.  The proprietor, it is true, attempted last year a ma-

powder, for covering the moulds used in founderies; but
this scheme has been given up.  The draining of the muir
would yield, in the end, the most certain profit to all con-
cerned, and it would likewise add very much to the mild-
ness of the air of Fala and its neighbourhood.  Something
of this fort, upon a small scale, has been attempted by the
present tenant; but nothing effectual can be done without
the interference of the proprietor, as no tenant would chuse
to sink so considerable a sum, as the draining would require,
upon the short lease of 20, or even 30 years.

   Soil, Produce, and Sheep.-The lower part of the parish is
mostly clay, and produces all the variety of crops which are
usual in other parts of the Lothians.  The upper part of the
parish is mostly heath; and the crops commonly cultivated
are barley and oats, with an interchange of turnips, grass,
and potatoes.  This upper, or muirland part, is by far the
most extensive, comprehending nearly two thirds of the
whole.  It is at present divided into four farms, which to-
gether maintain about 144 score of sheep.  The species of
