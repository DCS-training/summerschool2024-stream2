Turnips and sown grass, which were then far from common,
may now be seen on every, even the smallest farm; and with regard

	          I.-TOPOGRAPHY, &C.
Extent and Boundaries.-THE extent of the parish from north
to south is about 7 miles; and from east to west about 2 miles,
on an average. It is bounded on the north by the Moray Frith;

mile from the sea, the ground rises suddenly to a small hill. Beyond
this there is almost one continued plain, of 3 1/2 miles to length,
and about 1 1/4 in breadth, bounded on the side towards the river
by a steep bank, from forty to fifty feet in height. The soil, is for
the most part light. * The climate is mild and temperate, and
the situation healthy.
