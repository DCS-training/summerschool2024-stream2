     of Bothwell.

   The water of South Calder rises from several marshes
and fens in the parishes of Shotts and Cambusnethan, and
having continued its course for 15 miles, falls into the
Clyde a little below Orbreston.
   They are generally shallow in summer; but in winter
and rainy seasons, they pour a great quantity of water into
Clyde.
   The stream of the North Calder is considerably lessened
by the water being taken into the Monkland Canal at
Woodhall.
   These two waters are chiefly distinguished for the roman-
tic scenery of their banks; upon which account, all the
gentlemen who live in that part of the country, have pla-
ced their seats upon the banks of the one or other of these
two Calders.
   There are no lakes in the parish.

   Eminent Men.-Notwithstanding the adverse plan of
education in the parish, the following may be named under
this class, who owed their rise to more favourable semi-
naries:
   Two sons of the Rev. Mr William Hamilton, Messrs
Robert and Thomas succeeded each other as Professors of
Anatomy in the College of Glasgow.
   The last was succeeded by his only son, Mr William
Hamilton; a young gentleman, who, by his distinguished
abilities, and indefatigable application, soon acquired a very
high degree of fame in his profession.  He died in early
life; his loss was deeply felt, and universally regretted.  His
feeling heart, and gentleness of manners; his endearing
sympathy with the distressed, almost soothing away pain;
his rare and amiable virtues, will long live in the memory
of his friends, and in a very extensive circle of society.
