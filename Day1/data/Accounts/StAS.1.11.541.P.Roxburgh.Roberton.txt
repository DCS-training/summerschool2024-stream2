house, formerly the seat of an ancient family, is falling into
ruins.  The valued rent is 10,950 L. Scotch; the present actual
rent exceeds 3000 L. Sterling.

   Cattle.-The number of cattle is computed to be, as under:

<TABLE>

18,000 sheep,   358 black cattle,   127 horses.

   Produce.-There are 358 bolls of grain yearly sown, and
95 packs of wool annually sold.

   Fuel.-Peats are the principal fuel, and are reckoned as
dear as coals from Lothian or Northumberland, a distance of
30 miles.  The convenience of this species of fuel, its being
near at hand, and procured at a season, when servants upon
farms could not be otherwise so profitably employed, give it
the preference; and cottagers, living near mosses, make it a
business, through the year, to carry peats from the distance
of 8, and even sometimes 14 miles, to Hawick; where they
are sold, at the rate of from 3 s. to 4 s. the single cart load,
and from 1 s. 3 d. to 1 s. 6 d. the back load.

   Roads.-The expence of fuel is heightened by the badness
of the roads.  The principal road in the parish, and the most
direct one from Dumfries, etc. to the towns of Hawick, Sel-
kirk, etc. is along the Berthwick, but is made only half way
up this parish, and not even formed where it enters that of
Wilton.  The gentlemen of Dumfries-shire have carried this
line of road nearly to the confines of their own county; and
it is to be regretted, that they have not been seconded by pro-
prietors of land in the counties on the E., in a measure of
such obvious importance.  The heritors of Roberton are at
present improving, at a great expence, their part of this road,
