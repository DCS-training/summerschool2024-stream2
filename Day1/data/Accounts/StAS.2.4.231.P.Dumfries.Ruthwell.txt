	On comparing the Government census of 1821 with that of 1831,
it will appear as if the population of the parish had retrograded
during that period. There is reason to believe, however, that
there is a mistake here, independent of that already noticed, occa-
sioned in the census 1821 by counting the volunteers first sepa-
rately and then over again, according to their respective occupations.
On rectifying this mistake, it will be found that the number of in-
habitants has been, during the last ten years, very nearly stationary.
	The following is the average number of persons of different ages.

			Under 15 years of age.              466
			Between 15 and 30,                  282
			Between 30 and 50,                  242
			Between 50 and 70,                  117
			Upwards of 70,                       40
                                         ----

	There is but one resident proprietor of land in the parish, and
his estate, which he holds in his own possession, may amount to
about L. 200 a-year. There are four other heritors, and the pro-
perty of each exceeds the yearly sum of L. 50.
	The number of unlarried men, (bachelors and widowers,) up-
wards of 50 years of age, amounts to 7; and of unmarried women
upwards of 45, to 49.
	Estimating by the private census of the writer, there were in
1823-24, 143 married couples in the parish, whose offspring, male
and female, amounted to 586, which makes an average of some-
what more than four children residing in married families. If we
include the unmarried heads of families, the `verage number of
children will not amount to more than two and a-half. Were we
to take into account the children still alive who have left the pa-
ternal roof, the average would of course be greater.
