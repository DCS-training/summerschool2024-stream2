of plants, and thereby giving them access to draw nourish-
ment from many particles of earth which did not contribute
to their nourishment before such separation.  Therefore, the
more thoroughly that marl is intermixed or incorporated
with the soil to which it is applied, the more extensive and
powerful must be its effects.
   Marl can, with more ease or difficulty, be pulverised and
incorporated with the soil, in proportion as the marl is rich
or poor.  The richer the marl is, the less it has of a cohe-
sive quality, and therefore will be the more easily incorporated,
and the poorer the marl is, the more it has of a cohesive
quality, and therefore will be with the greater difficulty pul-
verised and incorporated with the foil to which it is applied.
   Marl, though specifically lighter than the soil on the sur-
face of which it is laid, does, by separating the parts of the
circumjacent earth, soon sink below the surface.  And if it
be allowed to sink in lumps, that is, before it be pulverised,
a great proportion of that marl will never afterwards be got
thoroughly to incorporate with the soil.  The most advan-
tageous method, therefore, of applying this valuable manure,
in order to obtain the full benefit of the quantity applied, is
to lay it on the ground while under a grass crop, and leave
it exposed on the surface over the winter season.  The
thickly interwoven roots of the grass will prevent any consi-
derable body of it from sinking below the surface, till it be
reduced by the winter frosts and rains, and, in small parti-
cles, washed into the earth.
   If marl must be laid on ground under fallow, it should
be previously put into a comport hill with earth, and, by
mixing and turning, thoroughly pulverised.
   Marl put into compost with hot dung, will, by the juices
of the dung, be rendered more clammy and cohesive than it
was before, and more unfit for incorporating with the
earth.
