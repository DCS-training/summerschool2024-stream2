   The funds for the poor are, the interest of 144 l. stock

Seven persons, receive, at present, a weekly pension from 1 s.

are allowed to beg.  Near to the village of Dundonald, is
the castle already mentioned, which gives name to the earl-
dom in the family of Cochrane.  The rising ground on
which the castle stands, with 5 roods of land adjoining, is

hills is still discernable the vestige of another castle, called
Kemplaw, and which is said to have been of high antiquity.
