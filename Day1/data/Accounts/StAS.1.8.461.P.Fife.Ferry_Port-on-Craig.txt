paratus for the fishing; but they are not equally productive
every season.  They do not begin to fish for salmon, in
this part of the river, till about the end of April; and they
give over the 26th of August.  There is only one boat's
crew engaged in the white fishery.  The fishing ground for
white fish is mostly without the river.  The fishermen carry
their fish to Dundee; so that the price of the small quantity
sold here, is regulated by the market there; but this fishing
has failed much for some years past.  In the summer months,
great numbers of small flounders are caught in this part of
the river, as any person is permitted to use hand lines in that
fishing.  It is very useful to the poor people, who have an op-
portunity of supplying their families with these fish, at no
expence.  On the south side of this part of the Tay, there is
a scalp of a small kind of mussels, esteemed good bait for the
white fish; they are purchased for that purpose by the fisher-
men in the neighbourhood.  In the sands there is also plenty of
sea worms, which the fishermen call Lugg, and prefer them
even to mussels for bait in the summer season; but these
worms sink so deep in the sand in winter, that they cannot
be got.  These small mussels are, therefore, the only bait used
for the white fishing, in winter.

   Migratory Birds.-Several kinds of sea fowls frequent the
shore during winter.  Every year, about the month of April,
they leave the coast, to go and hatch their young.  They re-
turn again in the month of August, and continue in this
country till April, when they take their annual flight.  They
are immediately succeeded by other sea fowls, that make their
appearance here in the spring, remain during the summer
months, and hatch about the shore.  In the month of August
or September, they remove from this to their winter habita-
tions.  Next season, at the usual time, they pay their annual
