defence in case of invasions by the Danes from the sea, or as a
stronghold, in order to retain possession of the country upon the
subjugation of the Moraymen in the reign of Malcolm IV.
   The ancient territory of Petty and Brachly, comprehending At
least the whole modern parish, first occurs in record as part of the
possessions of a branch of the great family of De Moravia, who
seem to have held these lands as firmarii, or tenants of the Crown,
from the end of the twelfth century; and, early in the thirteenth,
Walter De Moravia conferred the personage titles of the churches
of Petty and Brachly on the cathedral church of Moray, of which
they thenceforward formed one of the prebends, the patronage
remaining with the family of the granter.
   In 1226, Bishop Andrew enters into an agreement with Wal-
terus de Petyn, relative to the lands of Ardtrillen, Lunyn, Dul-
davy and Croyn, which lands his father, William, it is said, had
held, and affirmed that they belonged to him by hereditary right. It
is not improbable that Petyn bad been possessed by Freskyn himself.
In charter 61 of the chartulary of Moray, which establishes pre-
bends in Elgin cathedral, this is said to be done as to Pettie and
Bracholy, with the consent of Walter de Moravia, then patron.
In the preface to the chartulary we have an account of successive
possession of these lands by Sir Andrew Murray, and Archibald
the Grim, third Earl of Douglas, by his marriage with the heiress

   It is probable that the lands of Petty and Brachly formed part
of the territory contained in the successive erections of the Earl-
dom of Moray; while, at the same time, the neighbouring fami-
lies of Mackintosh and Kilravock had acquired some title to va-
rious parts of them, under which the former occupied the lands
of Hallhill, and the latter those of Flemington and Easter Brach-
ly, until the old tenure of Flemington was changed into a feu from
the Earls of Moray about the beginning of the seventeenth cen-
tury. The greater part of the parish is still the property of the
Noble family of Moray.
   The family manuscript history of the Mackintoshes, in posses-
sion of the chief at Moyhall, states, that the Mackintoshes became
possessed of Pettie and Bracholy, formerly possessed by the Mo-
raymen, who were entirely destroyed in the rebellion.
   In 1281, the Earl of Ross, having injured the churches of Pe-
tyn and Bracholy, came to terms with the church, by assigning
the lands of Kattepol and Pitkanny to the Elgin cathedral, as a
