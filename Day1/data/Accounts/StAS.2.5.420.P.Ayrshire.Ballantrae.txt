are from L. 4 to L. 5, 10s. half-yearly. Female servants receive
from L. 2 to L. 4, and experienced dairy-maids often L. 5 for the
half year.
     Prices of Provisions.--The price of butcher-meat is about 4d.
per lb. of 16 oz.; of butter 8d. per do.; fowls 1s. a piece; chickens 4d.
do.; cheese (sweet milk) 8s. 6d. per stone of 24lbs.; oatmeal about
2s. 3d. per stone in retail; cod-fish from 8d. to 1s. per stone of
16 lbs.; salmon-trout in May 7d. a lb., salmon in the beginning of

do.; turbot 4 1/2d. per lb.
        Husbandry.--In all the principal farms, the dairy system is a
good deal combined with the tillage system. On one farm, there
are above seventy cows kept during the whole year,--on each of two
others above-forty, on several others thirty, and from that down-
wards; and these same farms raise annually as much farm produce
as any others in the parish. About 5000 stones of sweet milk
cheese are made every year in Ballantrae.
     In tillage husbandry, the seven-shift rotation is usually practised,
i. e. supposing the land to be in pasturage, there is 1. a crop of
oats; 2. a green crop; 3. a crop of wheat or barley; 4. a hay
crop of rye-grass and clover; and then pasturage for three years.
Of late bone-dust is made use of to raise crops of turnips, which
are generally eaten off by sheep, and furrow-drainidg is practised
to a considerable extent.
     The length of leases is commonly nineteen years. All the farm-
steadings recently built are good; the others admit of considerable
improvement.
     The total number of acres in the parish may be estimated at
between 24,000 and 25,000. Of these about 7000 are arable;
400 of the arable are worth L. 2 an acre per annum; 2000
more are worth L. 1, and the rest are worth from 8s. to 10s. per
annum. The land not arable, being chiefly moor pasture, may be
considered worth 2s. 6d. per `cre a-year. The gross rental of the
land in the parish is L. 7456 a-year.
	Fisheries.--Besides the salmon-fishery, which we have already
mentioned, there is a white fishery chiefly of cod and turbot. It
commences about the 10th of January, and ends before the 1st
of April. A great many herrings are also caught some seasons.
The white fishery employs sixteen boats with four men in each, and
each boat takes to the value of from L. 35 to L. 40 a season. Last
season (1836) each boat took fully L. 40, which gives L. 640
