   Improvements.-The industry of the farmer will often in-
crease the value of a farm, where the sluggard will starve.  A
remarkable instance of this occurs in the improvement of the
farm of Murrayston, which was possessed by Mr James Dun-
can, and held by 4 tenants, at the low rent of 70 bolls, in the
year 1764, when they all became bankrupts.  The land-
holder then adapted his conversion for 19 years to Mr Do-
naldson, who exerted much industry, and improved the
farm greatly.  On his resignation, Mr Duncan entered at
an advanced rent of 10 L.  He lives as comfortably as Mr
Donaldson did; and now, besides the profits of his crop,
by attention to the dairy alone, draws, for milk and butter,
150 L. yearly.-It may be observed, that the farm of Burrow-
brigs was, 170 years ago, only rented at 18 bolls of victual*;
but now it rents at 100 L.  Sterling, owing to its vicinity to
the burrow lands of Elgin.  As a farther evidence of what
the grounds, by proper cultivation, may produce, Mr Rus-
sell, the proprietor of Westfield, has let his estate in lots of
from 20 to 40 acres, and built houses for the inhabitants,
whereby he gets a rent of from 30 s. to 40 s. per acre.  So
