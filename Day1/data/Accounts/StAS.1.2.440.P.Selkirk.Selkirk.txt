management of these, as the only arable part of his farm.  For
example, one-fourth oats, one-fourth turnips, potatoes, etc.
one-fourth barley, and one-fourth hay.  This rotation will af-
ford every farmer in this parish, abundant support for his fami-
ly, his stocks, and his cattle, however severe the winter may
be.  From what calamities would not this preserve them; we
should not then see them when storms arise, driving their
starved flocks to the less snowy hills of Annandale; nor pur-
chasing hay at an extravagant price, and carrying it through
almost impassable roads to their flocks, when their stomachs
are too weak to receive or digest it.  The management of
flocks begins to be better understood, and the farmers, by put-
ting fewer upon the same ground, have encreased the size of
their sheep, lessened the diseases to which they are liable, and
improved the quantity and quality of the wool, more than by
all the other means, hitherto discovered.

   To two diseases, of a very serious nature, the flocks here
are still exposed.  The one, a fever, to which the hogs or
sheep of the first year are so liable in winter, and especially
in variable weather, with intermitting frosts, that the farmer
reckons himself fortunate, if he loses only three of each score
in his hirstle.  This disease, (the braxy, as some call it), has
been examined, and is found to arise from the withered
grass on which the animal then feeds, and the want either of
liquid, or muscular motion in the stomach to dissolve it.  The
consequence is, that the dry and unconcocted food enters the
intestines in an impervious state; the obstructions excite an
inflammation, a fever and mortification, of which the animal
dies.  A remedy, has, with success, been attempted.  Turnips,
from their purgative nature, have been found capable, not on-
ly of preventing, but of curing, the disease.  The tops of
