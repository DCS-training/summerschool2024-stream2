     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF COLDINGHAM.

     (COUNTY OF BERWICK, SYNOD OF MERSE AND TIVIOTDALE,
     PRESBYTERY OF CHIRNSIDE).

     BY JOHN RENTON, Esq. of Chesterbank.

     Extent, Surface, etc,

   THIS parish is the largest of any in this country, but not
of the greatest value, as it includes a common moor,
which contains above 600 English acres, of a very poor qua-
lity.  There is no map of this parish.  In some parts, it is
between 6 and 7 miles in length, and as much in breadth,
and is of a very irregular figure, The appearance of this pa-
rish is rather flat, there being no high hills in it, but a great
proportion of rising grounds, of easy ascent, and gentle declivi-
ty, which are, with a few exceptions, all accessible by the
plough, and which, as well as the valleys and plain ground,
are of a fertile soil, excepting the heights about St. Abb's
