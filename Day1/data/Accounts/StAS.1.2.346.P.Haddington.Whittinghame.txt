length terminate at Soutra-hill.  They are intersected by va-
rious openings, lying in differnt directions, with streams of
water collected from the eminencies on each side, runninh
through the bottoms.
   Within these hills there are six sheep farms, belonging to the
parish of Whittingham*; most of which are extensive.  The
greatest part of the land, in that part of the country, is cover-
ed with heath, excepting some narrow stripes, which are
sometimes plowed, and, when the season is favourable, pro-

farms, is Kilpallet, consisting of about 1500 acres, rented only
at L. 16.

with a winding course, through the Merse, and falls into the
Tweed, about 4 miles above Berwick.  It is noted for plenty of
excellent trout.
