presbytery of Kelso, and synod of Merse and Teviot-
dale.  The former is in the county of Roxburgh, and the
latter in that of the Merse or Berwickshire.  The parish of 
Stitchel is situated on the north east corner of Roxburgh-
shire, and ten-twelfths of it are surrounded by Berwickshire.
It is said that the name Stitchel signifies in Gaelic a declivity;
and this name will be reckoned very proper by those who
have seen the situation of the house and village of Stitchel.
Most part of the parish is 600 feet above the level of
the river Tweed at Kelso, which is only four miles dis-

from south to north, and between three and four from east
to west.  The figure is irregular, being frequently intercept-
ed by the parishes surrounding it.

of 1, 3000 Sterling.  A good part of the land is of a strong
