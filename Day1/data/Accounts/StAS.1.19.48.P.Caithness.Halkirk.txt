costed by one Mahan Ryan, by name, a ruffian, who lay
in wait for him at the river, below the castle of Braal,
when he so maltreated him by tumbling him off his horse
into the river, and then by blows and suffocation of water,
that he was carried home as bruised and suffocated to death.
The villain's motive for this savage treatment, was, as it is
said, to be revenged of the minister for interposing the au-

resorted, and was the occasion of bloodshed.  The said John
Sinclair, heritable Sheriff of the county, decerned the sa-

added to the public funds.  Soon afterwards the remains of
the monument were erected, and inclosed with a stone dike
at his own expence, both of which are since entirely demo-
