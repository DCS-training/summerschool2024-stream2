years; a few are to be found of the age of 80 years; but
very few arrive at 90 years.  A farmer in the parish of
Stromness died last spring in the 94th year of his age, who
was married to one woman 69 years, who bore to him 8
sons.  She is 2 years younger than her husband, and is still
alive.  This man, till within two years of his death, went
as usual about his affairs, cut and brought home his peats,
and shot with his gun.  He was regular and temperate in
his life, and retained his faculties to the last.  The oldest
man in the parish of Sandwick is 88 years old.  There are
in the parish of Stromness two men of 86 years, one wo-
man of 90 years, and one of 92 years.  There are several
past 80; but it is not unfrequent, that when they pass that
period, their memory decays, and their faculties are im-
paired.

   Hills, Lakes, Mosses.-A great part of the west coast of
these-parishes consists of hills, occupying an extent of nearly
5 miles in length, and 1 or 2 miles in breadth.  Some of
these hills take their name from the next inhabited town
of land; others are distinguished by particular names, ma-
ny of which terminate in fiold, which means hill.  The
names are Cringliefiold, Baillifiold, Keirfiold.  This last is
a small hill, in the parish of Sandwick, very beautiful and
pleasant, rising with a gentle ascent; it is about a mile and
a half in circumference, is always covered with a green
verdure, and affords good pasture to sheep.  It is peculiar,
however, to the sheep that feed upon this hill, that their
teeth soon become yellow.  There are two or three small
lochs, but no mosses in the parish of Sandwick; there are
two small mosses in the parish of Stromness, but no lochs.
