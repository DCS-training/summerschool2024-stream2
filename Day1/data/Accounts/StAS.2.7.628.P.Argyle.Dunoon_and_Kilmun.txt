sources whence contributions are derived, are the interest on ac-
cumulated fund, invested (as noticed) in erecting the addition to
the Dunoon church, morthcloth dues, and dues on proclama-
tions of bans for marriage, with occasional donations from heritors
and benevolent individuals; and during the seven years mentioned
above, there have been distributed from these sources cumula-
tively,--in 1836, L.46, 8s. 6 1/4d.; 1837, L.33, 12s. 7 1/2d.; 1838,
L.38, 7s. 7 1/4d.; 1839, L.34, 18s. 7 1/2d.; 1840, L.31, 14s. 3 1/2d.;
1841, L.28, 14s. 7 1/2d.; 1842, L.30, 8s. 7 1/2d.  The highest
amount of annual church-door collections at Dunoon has been, in
1842, L.101, 8s. 9 1/2d.;-and at Kilmun church, the highest has
been, in 1841, L.31, Is. 0 1/4d.
   The sums here stated have been found barely adequate to sup-
ply the wants of the existing pauperism; and during the period
mentioned, it has been found necessary, on two occasions, to draw
to a small amount upon the accumulated fund. The amount
of pauperism varies from year to year; but its tendency has un-
doubtedly been, during the period now under review, to increase.
There is no other mode used in procuring funds for the poor besides
that of church-door collections and the other means mentioned.
The disposition to refrain from seeking parochial relief is very
swiftly passing away; instances of it are met with, and in the rural
parts of the parish they are more frequent; but among those ac-
customed to compulsory modes of relief in towns, no such feeling
can be expected to exist: and their example here must he ex-
pected to have its effect. The facility of obtaining parochial set-
tlement is felt to be a special grievance, not beneficial to the
poor at large, and highly injurious, even oppressive, to individual
parishes; and in a country like Scotland, where local changes are
continually progressive, an extension of the period necessary to
make good parochial settlement, from three to seven years at least,
would assuredly be an improvement in this difficult branch of na-
tional legislation,-and would unquestionably be conducive to the
interests, of morality among the poor themselves.
   Prisons and Police.-There is no jail nor place of confinement
in Dunoon, or the united parish. It has been in contemplation
for some time past to erect a lock-up house at Dunoon. The ru-
ral police established in the county has been found beneficial here,
in suppressing vagrancy, and in checking petty delinquencies.
There are no fairs or markets of any general resort held within
the parish.
