field, are commodiously lodged at the new village of Lenox-
town; and at the Kincaid, or Easter Field, several of the print-
ers have feued steadings on the grounds; so that there is eve-
ry probability of a neat village being built, for the conve-
nience of its servants:  At first, (as was to be expected in
all new works,) the operative people were a little turbulent;
and considering that they were a collection from all the dif-
ferent corners of the country, enjoying high wages, and car-
ried away by the licentiousness of the times, their turbulence
was not to be wondered at; but that is now all over; and
there are scarce any works in the country, where the people
behave more circumspectly towards their employers, and are
more regular in their deportment.
   These public works employ each of them two Excite of-
ficers; and they pay of revenue to Government about four
thousand pounds each per annum.
   It may be proper to notice, that although the wages of ca-
lico printers seem to be the highest of any in the country;
no doubt, when the long apprenticeship is considered, along
with the unwholesome nature of the work, the wages per-
haps should be greater than of most other operative people;
at the same time, when it is considered, that the highest wa-
ges do not always make the wealthiest tradesiman; perhaps,
if some method could be fallen upon to reduce the prices,
both the tradesman and the public would be gainers.
   The following table exhibits the present situation of one
fieId, as far as is known to the public.  There being nearly
the same workmen at both, the same table may apply to each.
