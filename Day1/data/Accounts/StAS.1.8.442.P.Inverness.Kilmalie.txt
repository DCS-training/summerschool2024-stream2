   What would be of still greater benefit to this parish, and
likewise to all the surrounding countries, would be the esta-
blishment of a manufactory of coarse woollen cloth.  If
nations consider the exportation of raw materials, as one of the

     "Our poor would be rich, and our rich would be great,
     "And quite independent of minions of state."
