a most inconvenient and detrimental mode of payment,to a
minister.  The church being ruinous was pulled, down, and
a new and elegant one erected in 1789, not on the church-
yard, but on a small eminence belonging to the glebe at a
little distance, for which Baron Gordon gave an equivalent
to the minister, with the concurrence of the Presbytery.  The
manse also being ruinous, a new and good one, together with
offices, was built some years afters the incumbent's entry, and

legal school master, who teaches Latin, English, writings,
arithmetic and book-keeping, and is attended by about 60
scholars in winter, and 50 in summer.  His salary is only 7
bolls, 2 lippies meal, at 8 stone per boll, and 2 L. 7 s. 4 1/2 d.

are 1 s. 4 d. Sterling, for English, 2 s. for writing and arith-
metic, and 2 s. 6 d. for Latin per quarter.  It is much to be

ty education, and are a most useful class of men to the com-
munity, should be so miserably provided for, as to have
scarcely the necessaries of life.

them are mendicants.  At the present incumbent's entry, the on-
ly fund belonging to them, besides collections, fees of mortcloth,
and fines for delinquencies, was 10 L. It is now increased
by savings to 70 L. the interest of which, with the collections
on Sunday, amounting to between 5 L. and 6 L. Sterling, and
the collections at the Sacraments extending to between 4 L.
and 5 L. and the payment of a velvet mortcloth at burials to-
gether with the voluntary offerings of transgressors, consti-
tute a tolerable provision for the poor, who are generally
