   12. Roads.-The by-roads of the farmers, all over the
parish, are in a wretched condition, and absolutely impas-
sable through the one half of the year.  The carts and har-
ness are generally shattered and broke in a few journies;
and hence the horses, carts, and harness, constantly wear the
marks of poverty, and, instead of performing the work with
vigour, both men and horses soon languish and decay.
   It is, however, pleasant to observe the situation of the
farmer who studies improvements, who has a comfortable
habitation, and good roads; the fresh bloom of contentment
is seated on his countenance, his motions are spirited and ac-
tive, his implements of husbandry appear as if fresh from
the hand of the painter, and his vigorous horse is seen paw-
ing in the valley.
   13. Implements of husbandry.-While the lands were in-
fested with stones, the implements of husbandry were ex-
tremely mean; but good ploughs, and harrows of the best
construction, are now every where to be seen.  Yet, where
the groudns remain wet and stony, the labouring utensils are
still imperfect.  What is termed the broad-plough is still
used on the north side of Teith.  In this plough 4 horses are
yoked abreast, with a goadman or driver placed before the
horses heads, with his face towards the ploughman; and in
this position the driver walks backward, striking the horses
in the face to make them come forward!-The brake
and cleaning-harrow are little known.  The late Colonel
Edmonstone of Newton introduced the new-invented turnip
drill-plough; but the farmers only looked and wondered at
it, as they would at a rope-dancer.  Several eminent far-
mers have, however, shewn noble examples of good husban-
dry, and are beginning to open the eyes of their neighbours,
from their farms appearing like so many gardens, in the
midst of a bleak uncultivated country.
