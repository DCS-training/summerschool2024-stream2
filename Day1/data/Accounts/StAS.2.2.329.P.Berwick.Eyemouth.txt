this fishing has been on the decline; and, for some years past, even
the boats belonging to Eyermouth have not remained on this coast,
but proceeded to Sunderland, Wick, &c. to prosecute the fishing.
By this change much injury has been done to the trade of the port
of Eyemouth; many valuable properties erected for the purpose of
curing herrings have been rendered for a season altogether use-
less; and much lucrative employment has been lost to the poor of
the town and neighbourhood. By the introduction of barilla at a
low duty, the manufacture of kelp, which formerly afforded em-
ployment to a number of our poor people, has been also destroyed.
   Newcastle, Hull, and London, are the ports generally resorted
to for the sale of smoked or red herrings; white herrings are com-
monly sent to Ireland, the Baltic, or the West Indies. The pro-
duce of the cod fishery is exported to London either in a dried or
pickled state.

   In the former Statistical Account it is stated, "this port is a
branch of the custom-house of Dunbar, and our merchants are
obliged to go there, which is a distance of twenty miles, to report
every cargo, and to get sufferances to load or unload, and there-
after to go back again for cockets and clearances, which is attend-
