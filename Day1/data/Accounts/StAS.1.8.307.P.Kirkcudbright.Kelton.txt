     of Kelton.

   Character, etc.-The inhabitants of Kelton are, in general,
an intelligent, polite, social, and hospitable people.  In regard
to elegance in houses, neatness of dress and genteel living,
they are equal, if not superior to their neighbours around
them.  The sentiments of the people of Kelton, with respect to
religion and morality, are, for the most part, rational, just, and
free from bigotry.-None belonging to the parish, in the me-
mory of the oldest now living, have suffered the pains of law
for any capital crime.-There are four noted inns in the pa-
rish, and many small tippling houses.  These little gin shops
have a ruinous effect, upon the health and morals of the low-
er classes of the people; the adopting, therefore, some effectual
measure for their suppression, would be a business not un-
worthy the attention of those, to whom the police of the
country is intrusted.
