   Extent of Coast, Kelp, etc.-The whole extent of coast,
exclusive of Gairsay and the holms, may be 13 or 14 miles;
and the shores, being mostly flat and rocky, produce sea-
weed or tang, from which kelp is made to the amount of 
70 tons at an average, yearly.  The expence of manufactu-
ring which is from a guinea to a guinea and a half per ton;
but the expence of this, as well as every other kind of la-
bour, is daily increasing.

     Soil and Culture.-These parishes are tolerably fertile,
and produce pretty good crops, considering the variable cli-
mate and defective mode of culture.  The soil, in general,
is rather shallow, an admixture of clay and sand on a rocky 
bottom, which renders it wet in winter, and liable to be 
poached by the cattle, as there is no winter herding, nor 
any inclosures.  The corn lands have been kept in perpe-
tual tillage for time immemorial, without fallowing, or 
any rotation of crops, except bear and small grey oats alter-
nately.  In Evie the principal manure is ware or sea-weed,
of which there is generally a sufficient quantity drove on 
shore during the winter and spring.  In Rendall, having 
little of this kind of manure, as its shores are surrounded 
with islands, they use a compost of earth and dung, and in 
some places sea-weed of an inferior quality.  To procure 
this earth, they pare off the surface of the grass and pasture 
grounds, in many places to the totally impoverishing the 
soil, and rendering it wholly useless.  The Orkney side-
plough, with one stilt, is universally used.  It is drawn by 
three or four small horses a-breast, and though, to a stranger,
it seems a very aukward trifling machine, totally unfit for 
tillage, (as it certainly is in a stiff soil), yet, where the 
ground has been in constant tillage, with an experienced 
ploughman, it performs a great deal of work, and in a man-
ner far beyond expectation; insomuch, that the present in-
