which the delay and expense of short carriages are rendered con-
siderably greater than they would have been otherwise, and the
inducement to the transport, for example, of stones from the large
granite quarries, in the neighbourbood of the town, is much lessen-
ed.  Nevertheless, the trade on it has not been inconsiderably,
though hitherto not sufficient to pay off the mortgage debt, and
therefore, as yet, altogether unproductive to the holders of either
the new or the original shares.
   In 1832, the holders of the mortgage, being sensible of the, great
advantage which would accrue to the trade of the canal from its
being connected by a tide-lock with the harbour, agreed to fore-
go their dividends for a time, in order to permit this to be effected,
and the tide-lock, whose height is 6 feet, was accordingly executed
in 1834, at an expense of about L.1500.
   By this means, the canal barges can be loaded and discharged
at the ship's side, and can enter the canal readily at half-tide; by
which, the intercourse on it bar been greatly facilitated, and the
trade consequently increased.  The dues charged on articles con-
veyed by the canal are from 1/2d. to 1 1/2d. per ton per mile, accord-
ing to the nature of the goods.
   The following tables shew the quantities of the principal ar-
ticles transported by the canal for the last seven years:-

   The increase in the quantity of grain is to be in part ascribed
to the introduction of covered barges, by which the cargo is effec-
tually protected from rain on its passage.
   A Fly or passage boat was, at an early period, established on the
canal, and for some years it was carried on with considerable suc-
cess; but the establishment of numerous coaches on the adjoin-
ing turnpike road, presenting the advantage of quicker travelling,
though at a higher rate, had the effect of diminishing the profits
of the fly-boat very materially.  With the view of obtaining a re-
