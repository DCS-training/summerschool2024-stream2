the grounds dry; but as it seldom happens that any field in
the Carfe is to completely free of inequalities, the last ope-
ration, after it is sown and harrowed in, is to draw a surrow
with 'the plough through every hollow in the field, which
lies in such a direction that it can be guided through them,
as at a a a, and so as to make a free communication with
any of the surrounding ditches, or with any of the surrows

When this track is once
opened with the plough, it
is widened, cleared out, and
so shaped with the spade,
that it may run no risk
of filling up.  Its width
should be from 6 inches to a foot, according to its depth,

upon the level of
the field; but the
breadth of a spade at
bottom is a good gene-

pars of the same field,
which do not extend
wholly across it, or
which do not pass
through it, in any direction that a plough can follow; but
which may extend over two ridges, d d, or one ridge, e, or
even part of a ridge; such require an open communication
