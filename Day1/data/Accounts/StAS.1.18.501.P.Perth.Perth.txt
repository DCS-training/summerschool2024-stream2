spring tides, on Monday, October 4th, 1210, happened at
Perth, 18 minutes past 2 in tile morning; and 42 minutes
past 2 in the afternoon.
   It may be satisfactory to give the progress of the king, as
it may be traced in Fordun's history.  In summer 1210, the
king who was then aged and infirm, went to amuse himself
in the province of Moray, where the place of his birth was.
In his return, he fell sick at Kintore, a town in the district

they reckoned to have been a stable or cow-house.  They
