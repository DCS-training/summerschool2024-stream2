the Crinan canal will be finished, that there will be an in-
crease of trade in all the western isles, and that then, instead
of asking a salary, some may find it their interest to apply
for leave to keep packets.  The run from Tiry to Crinan,
by the west side of Mull, will be straight, and hardly ex-
