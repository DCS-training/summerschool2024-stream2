of William Dallas of Strathardel,) and Wester Haugh, now
called Burrowbrigs.  From the eastern precincts of the pa-
lace, a ridge of moor stretches the whole length of the pa-
rish, nearly 4 miles, rising gradually towards the west into
a pretty high hill, and clothed almost throughout its whole
extent with thriving plantations of fir, interspersed with other
forest trees.  The medium breadth of the parish is nearly two
miles.  On the south side of the highest part of this ridge, about
a mile westward from Elgin, on the post road to Forres, there
is a large extent of very flourishing natural oak wood, the pro-
perty of the Earl of Fife, who has inclosed it with a substan-
tial stone wall, and keeps it properly thinned and clear of
underwood, so that, when fully grown, its value must be
very considerable.  Under a thin stratum of moorish soil,
the whole of this ridge seems to be a mass of excellent hard
free stone; of which there is a quarry, near the summit of the
hill, that supplies a large extent of country with mill-stones,
and the town of Elgin and the neighbourhood with stones
for building.  When the intended BRIDGE OVER THE
SPEY at Fochabers comes to be erected, it will, no doubt,
occur to those concerned, that they can no where be sup-
plied with better stones, or at a cheaper rate, than from the
Earl of FIFE'S quarry in this parish.

   Soil, Climate, River, etc.-Upon each side of this ridge
lies the whole of the cultivated land, in which almost every
variety of soil is to be met with, from the heaviest clay to
the lightest sand.  The air is healthy, and, on the south
side of the hill, peculiarly soft and warm, during a great
proportion of the year: On the north side, the climate is
not so pleasant, the soil being wet and cold, and the lake of-
ten emitting a very thick and disagreeable fog.  These dis-
advantages do not, however, seem to have any bad effects
