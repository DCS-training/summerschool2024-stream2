front of a gallery, having the date 1596, and marked with
the initials of Robert Montgomery of Giffan, a younger son
of the Earl of Eglintoun, and his lady, who was of the family
of Loudoun.  The church is built in the form of across.  In
1754, one of the ailes was lengthened, so as to admit of near-
ly 200 additional fitters.  This was done at the expence of
the Kirk Session, with the advice and consent of the heritors,
for the behoof of the poor*.

   Population.-About the time of the revolution, or rather ear-
lier, the Kirk-town of Beith, as it was then called, is said to have
consisted only of 5 dwelling houses, and the minister's manse.
Accordingly, the 5 feued houses are mentioned, as a distinct
article, in the cess books.  In the year 1759, there were
about 700 examinable persons in the town, and upwards of
800 in the country part of the parish.  The return to Dr.
Webster, in 1755, was 2064 souls.  The number of inhabi-
tants in the country, has continued much the same ever since;
but the population of the town increased so rapidly, that, in
1788, it contained nearly 1500 examinable persons.  Since
that period, however, it has rather decreased.  From a very
accurate enumeration taken lately, with a view to be inserted
in this paper, the population was found to be as follows:

<FOOTNOTE>

*From a Latin inscription upon a grave-stone in the church-yard, it appears,
that Mr. WILLIAM MAITLAND was minister here, from 1669 to 1681, when
he died at the age of 46.  It is said that he was one of those who accepted the
indulgence.  The old people speak of some curates who succeeded him, but none
of them were of any note.  The third minister of Beith, after the revolution,
was Dr. WILLIAM LEECHMAN, late principal of the University of Glasgow, in
1736; who, in 1744, was succeeded by Dr. JOHN WOTHERSPOON, now Presi-
dent of Princetown College, New Jersey, to whom the present minister, succeed-
ed in 1758.
