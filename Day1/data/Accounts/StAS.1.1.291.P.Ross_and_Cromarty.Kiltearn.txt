   Language, and Etymology of Names.-The language com-
monly spoken here is the Gaelic, or Earse; but, of late years,
the English begins to be more cultivated than formerly, and
is understood by the generality of the inhabitants.  The
church service is performed here, as in the greatest part of
the county, in Gaelic in the forenoon, and in English in the
afternoon.

   The names of places seem, in general, to be of Gaelic ori-
ginal.  For example, Balcony, that is, in Earse, a dwelling-

Kead vail, or, the first possession, acquired by the Earls of
Ross in this parish.  Tennaird, that is, the house on the height.
Mountgerald is a modern name given by Mr McKenzie, 
father to the present proprietor, to a place formerly called
Clyne, being situated on an inclined plain.  This name was
given in allusion to Fitzgerald, who came from Ireland, and
who was the progenitor of the McKenzies.

   Antiquities and Curiosities.-About half a mile to the west
of the house of Clyne, and a quarter of a mile to the north
of the post road, is a remarkable piece of antiquity, which
plainly appears to have been erected by the Druids, and used
by them as a place of sacred worship.  It consists of a single
row of twelve large stones, placed upright, and so disposed as
to form two ovals, which are joined to each other.  The
areas of these ovals are equal; they are 13 feet from east to
west, and 10 feet in the middle from north to south.  At the
west end of one of them is a stone, which rises 8 feet above the
