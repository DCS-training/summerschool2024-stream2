above 20 miles in diameter, and is esteemed by all who have
viewed it, as naturally one of the most delightful vallies to be
found in Great Britain.  But the principal part of it being the
property of some great landlords, there are, of consequence,
but few gentlemens houses in it.  It is, therefore, the more
necessary, that it should be ornamented with neat and good
looking farm-houses, and with a considerable number of groves,
and plantations of trees, in order to give it a thriving and pro-
sporous appearance.-It is to be hoped, that this will soon
be brought about; and, perhaps, no objects are better intitled
to the attention of a public-spirited society, (could one be con-
stituted for the purpose) than to encourage the planting of fo-
rest timber, and to improve the accommodation of our hus-
bandmen, who are justly to be accounted not the least valu-
able part of the community.
