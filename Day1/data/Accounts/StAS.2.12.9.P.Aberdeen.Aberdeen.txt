in producing those indications must be admitted; but such
changes, at the same time, produce a change in the relations of
the air to moisture, which often the most sensible hygrometer will
fail to indicate, but which the lapse of a few hours proves to be
not the less real on that account.
   The sensible proof that the air is saturated with moisture seems
to be obtained-by the falling of-rain ; buteven here it is not suf-
ficient to find that rain has fallen in order to justify the conclu-
sion, that the air was overloaded with moisture, or to find that
no rain has fallen, in order to warrant the inference that the quanti-
ty of moisture contained in the air was less than it was capable Of
dissolving.  Sudden changes in this respect often take place, which
are not by any means always proportioned to the changes of tem-
perature, and sometimes are even altogether unconnected with
them, and which it is extremely difficult to take any accurate ac-
count of.  It is true that rain often falls from a considerable height
in the atmosphere, and we are therefore unable to judge accurate-
ly of the circumstances of that stratum of air from which it is pre-
cipitated; but this is not always the case, and rain is sometimes
produced as it were before our eyes, while the previous indication
of the thermometer and of the hygrometer gave little information
regarding it.  The rain guage may thus occasionally become a use-
ful addition to both of these ; though it is obviously not capable of al-
ways indicating the actual quantity of moisture separated from the
air in any given situation; 1st, because it will catch a consi-
derable portion, (and indeed the greater part of what it does catch,
is probably to be considered as derived from this source,) of what
is separated from strata of air at a considerable but very variable
height above the place of observation; 2d, because the circum-
stances of the various strata of air through which the rain falls
before reaching the guage, are liable to such endless variety, that
the quantity of water collected bv the guage may be either very
considerably greater, or very much less than the actual quantity
precipitated in the form of rain ; and 3d, because when rain is
produced from that stratum of the air in which the rain-guage is
placed, much of the amount of its indications will depend on the
situation which the guage occupies, as that which in the upper
parts of the stratum is but a drizzle or small rain may sometimes
be found to be a very heavy shower, if observed in a situation
only a small number of feet lower.   An observation of this
kind was made on one occasion by the late Dr Copland, Professor
of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, who found the rain
