requires the winter frost to ripen, or rather to whiten the
grain, before it can be reaped.  It would therefore be
more for the interest of the farmers, at least in the higher
grounds, to keep less of their farms in tillage, and more
in pasture.  A considerable number of black cattle, how-
ever, are reared in the pasture grounds, which find a ready
fale in the Edinburgh market; and several of the tenants
pay their rents in that way.  The dampness of the climate,
renders it rather unfit for breeding sheep, as they are very
subject to the rot in winter; but from its vicinity to the
capital, the farmers find it very profitable to purchase, in
the spring and summer months, a certain number, for the
purpose of fattening them, by which they make a hand-
some return for the short time they are kept on their
grounds.  The success of this business depends on chusing
the kinds that are the easiest fattened, so as to have two
or three returns in the course of the season.  A good ma-
ny horses also, are brought up in this parish; and at Her-
miston, one of the most extensive dealers in the island, in
that branch, with an uncommon fair character for a joc-
key, resides in it.  The manure used here, is either dung
from Edinburgh or lime.  The latter is driven from the
distance of 5 miles, though there is abundance of limestone
in the parish itself, if coal were wrought to burn it.

   Improvements.-Most of the improvements in this pa-
rish, are the work of the present race of inhabitants; a sin-
gular enough fact in a district, only 6 miles fronm the capi-
tal.  Mr Craig of Riccarton was the first who set the ex-
ample of inclosing land on his own estate here, which he
has now brought to the highest state of cultivation.  The
late clergyman, Mr Craig, was the first who introduced
into it the modern practice of busbandry from East Lo-
thian.  He was succeeded in the same system by the in-
