			V.--PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.
	Market-Town.--The nearest market-town hs Forfar, four miles
distant. A turnpike-road from Forfar to Dundee passes through
the parish, for four miles. Two public coaches travel on the road
daily, one from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, the other from Brechin
to Dundee.
	Ecclesiastical State.--The parish church is conveniently situated
for the parishioners, being three miles from the extreme points of
the parish. It was built in 1754, is in a good state of repair, and
can accommodate 600 persons. The manse was built long ago,
but has been enlarged and repaired at different periods. The last
alterations and additions were made in 1831, soon after the admis-
sion of the present incumbent.
	The glebe is upwards of twelve acres in extent, equal in quality to
the average land of the parish. In 1813, the Court give a stipend
of 14 chalders, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for. communion elements. All the
families in the parish attend the Established church except six;
consisting of four Independents, five Seceders, and three Episcopa-
lians. The Established church is well attended, and the people are
much attached to our national establishment. The communicants
amount to about 400. The amount of church collections for cha-
ritable and religious purposes annually is about L. 6.
	Education.--There are two schools in the p`rish, the parochial
and a private one, taught by a female. In both, English and writ-
ing are taught; in the parish school, Latin and the ordinary branches
of education. The salary of the parochial teacher is the maximum:
and the yearly amount of his school fees is about L. 27. The school
fees vary from 2s. to 10s. 6d. per quarter. There are no persons,
from six to fifteen years of age, who cannot read. The parents, in
general, have a becoming sense of the value of education. Some
parts of the parish are pretty far from the parish school, but there
is a subscription school in the neighbourhood. The total number
of scholars at schools in the parish is 80 ; but there are also about
30 attending schools on the borders of the parish.
