that which had been enjoyed by his colleague.  This arrange-
ment, the oftensible reason of which was the poverty of the
burgh, (which after tile disjunction of Abbotshall, paid the
whole of the second minister's stipend); the presbytery were
prevailed on to allow for a time.  And although the town-
council have, ever since the death of the incumbent with
whom the arrangement was made, appropriated that sti-

   Stipend.-The crown presents to the first charge; the town
council were in use of supplying the second.  The stipend of
the second charge in 1759, was 1000 merks Scots.  The
present stipend of the first charge is 120 14/64 bolls of bear, 79 1/4
bolls of oats, and 100 merks of vicarage.  The last decreet
of augmentation (which, was passed in 1737) gives also the
tiend of fish according to use and wont.  But as almost the
whole of the fish sold here, is carried over land, and the use
and wont is understood to confine the minister's right to fish
carried into the parish by water, no advantage is at present
derived to him from this part of his decreet.  The first mi-
nister has a manse; a glebe of about 2 1/2 acres, and about the
same quantity of land, independent of the glebe, enjoyed since
1678 by a private mortification.  By a recent judgement of the
presbytery, the minister is found intitled-to have this glebe
enlarged to the legal standard, and to have ground assigned
to him for pasture.  This judgement has, however, been
suspended, and is now under the review of the Court of
Session.

known.  It is said to have been dedicated to St. Brisse; who
