county funds, some subscriptions from the neighbourhood,
and the remainder by Mr. Cumin of Relugas, who took the
whole charge of the work.  It is a most useful bridge for this
part of the country, opening a safe communication, betwixt
the lower part of it and the higher, at a place where many
lives were formerly lost.-In addition to the above road, from
Forres to Granton and Aviemore, Sir James Grant, with a
view to shorten the distance from Elgin to Edinburgh, through
Strathspey, has planned out a new road, on the east side of the
Knock-Hill, intended to pass through the valley of Pluscar-
dine.  This road is already made, with great labour, and at

Elgin to Granton no less than 8 miles.  The gentlemen of
this parish are very attentive to the roads, and call out the
people to perform the statute labour, with great exactness,
every year; but the roads are of such extent, and so difficult
to make, that it is impracticable, upon the present system, to
keep them in very good order.

of yearly rent.  The 2 last years, 1791 and 1792, have been
very favourable.  The Sluie Pool, where most of the fish are
caught, has been celebrated, from the most ancient times, for
the great number of fish taken there.  By a letter, dated 7th
June 1648, from James, then Earl of Moray, to the Countess,
it would appear, that the fishing was greatly more abundant
in those days than in latter times; for he writes, that "in
"one night, on this pool, 1,300 salmon were taken; and, at
"one draught, fix and twenty scores." This curious letter is
