the different instruments, the method of making observa-
tions, with the calculations and results deduced from them,
were explained to the students.  Here also a regular series of
observations was kept for several years, of some of which, re-
lating to the longitude and latitude of the observatory, the
result is published by Dr Mackay, by whom many of them
were taken, in the 4th volume of the Edinburgh Philosophi-
cal Transactions.
   The want of accommodation for an observer, and the dis-
tance of the observatory from the College, which was consi-
derable, rendering a constant course of observations almost
impracticable, only such as were of importance continued af-
terwards to be taken, until about two years since, when the
situation being judged necessary to be included in the space
of groud allotted for the building of barracks, and the very
spot wanted for a powder magazine, it was of course demol-
ished.  From a proper representation however of these cir-
cumstances, by the Earl of Mansfield, late chancellor of the
University, a sum of money has been obtained from govern-
ment, as an indemnification for the loss sustained, and to en-
able the College to build an observatory in another place.
With this money, a large apartment is now constructing over
a part of the College buildings, which from its commanding
a more complete view of the horizon, from its contiguity,
and other conveniences, is expected to answer the purposes
of an observatory even better than the former.  Its height
above the level of the court is about sixty feet; but such is
the position, extent, and solidity of the interfering walls,
that, excepting perhaps in the case of violent storms, when
observations can seldom be taken in any situation, it is ex-
pected, that with proper precautions, the instruments will be
as little liable to tremor as before.  Here will be a room of
about forty feet by eighteen, with three amall cupolas, two
