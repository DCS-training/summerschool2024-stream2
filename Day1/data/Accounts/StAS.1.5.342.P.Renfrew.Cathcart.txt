town affords them a great advantage.  This, of all others,
is found to be the most permanent and substantial manure.
Lime, although it is to be met with every where through-
out the parish, has, especially of late, been but sparingly
used.  Nay, there are farms in this parish, which, by be-
ing constantly limed, without receiving any other manure,
have become altogether barren.  Lime acts upon the soil, as
a powerful stimulant, and brings forth whatever nourish-
ment it has.  Unless, therefore, its vegetative powers, be
seasonably restored, by some other species of manure, the
ground may, and, in many cases, actually has been reduced to 
a caput mortuum.

   Produce.-Summer fallowing is not much practised.  In-
stead of this, the ground is prepared for potatoes, by giving
it repeated plowings, and laying upon it from 40 to 60
carts per acre, of the manure above mentioned.  Each cart,
costs from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. before it is laid upon the field.
The potatoes being planted in drills, are first cleansed with
the hand hoe, when beginning to appear above the ground,
after which, (as their perfection, it would appear, in a great
measure, depends much upon their being taken the best
care of when young, till they arrive at a certain length,)
they are repeatedly dressed with a small single-borse plough.
The profit arising from this crop, properly managed, is so
great, as scarcely to be credited in places less favourably
situated.  L. 10, L. 15, and even L. 20 per acre, have been
received for them, before they have been dug up.  It
must be owned, indeed, that nothing but such a market as
Glasgow, to which a bulky article like this can be trans-
ported, and immediately sold, could enable the farmer to
derive so much profit.  But the advantage of this manage-
ment does not end here.  After the potatoes are taken up,
wheat is sown, and we have scarcely known an instance,
