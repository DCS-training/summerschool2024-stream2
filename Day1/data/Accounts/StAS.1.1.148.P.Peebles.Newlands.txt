     NUMBER XVIII.

     PARISH OF NEWLANDS.

     By the Rev. Mr FINDLATER.

     Situation, Soil, etc.

   NEWLANDS is situated in the shire of Tweeddale and
presbytery of Peebles.  It is bounded by the parishes
of Linton, Lyne, Kirkhurd, Stobo, Eddlestone, and Penny-
cook.  The face of the parish is diversified with hills and val-
leys.  The hills are in general clayey, more or less mixed
with stones.  The arable land is in general a clay loam, up-
on a close impervious silly bottom.  It is liable to poach in
winter, and therefore not fit for turnip sheep feeding.

   There is scarcely any heath in the parish.  The pastures are
all green; and white clover abounds where the land has been
limed.  Trees thrive every where, and thorn hedges grow
very well.  In high exposed situations, on spouty clay soil, the
oak seems to thrive better than any other white wood usually
planted among evergreens, as on a hill top above Romanno.
From the Wheam to Moothill bridge, the land is all enclo-
sed and well wooded.  Larix and other firs of a large size are
to be seen at Lamancha and Wheam:  At the latter, silver fir
was lately cut which afforded planks of 27 inches.
