faring trade.  It is asserted by the farmers, that, with-
out the money they make by fishing, and other shifts,
they would not be able to pay the rent of their lands;
that the produce of the farms is not nearly equal to the
porpose.  This may, indeed, be true, in the way they
manage them; for, having two objects in view, they are
not able to pay proper attention to either; consequently
neither the one nor the other succeeds with them ac-
cording to expectation; but it is equally certain, were
they to apply totally to either, whether farming or fish-
ing be their choice, that they would succeed better.
Experience proves the fact:  for all those who attend 
properly to their farms, and depend upon them alone for
livelihood, are the most wealthy tenants in the parish.
The tenants, in general, are poor; and the principal
causes of their poverty, besides those that have been
mentioned, are, 1st, That too many families are often
crowded into one small farm, and possess it in common;
2dly, That they generally overstock their farms; i.e.
they keep upon a farm a great many more cattle than it

very great error; for it reduces the breed to a diminu-
tive size; and, being ill fed, they are, in a manner, use-
less to the proprietors; 3dly, They plough much more
of their ground than they are able properly to manure.
It is not at all rare to see 5 or 6 tenants living upon the
same small farm, and possessing it in the old mode of
run-ridge; each of these keeps a cottager; and there are,
perhaps, as many other small tenants, who have each a
few acres arable land, with grass for 2, 3, or 4 cows,
cut out for himself, without any enclosure but a nomi-
nal line of march drawn between himself and the rest of
the farm; and these small farms, so cut off, are here
