According to the proportion of births to deaths, there ought
to be a great annual increase. The registers are not very
exact and faithful, many parents neglecting their duty in the
registration of their children; and of deaths there is no register.
But I had occasion to keep an account for a short time of births
and deaths, when I found there were thirty-seven of the for-
mer and only seven of the latter; nor have I reason to think that
this remarkable disproportion varies materially from the annual
average. The supernumeraries, beyond the demand for farms
and labour, slip off, as they rise up, to towns or other parts of the
country, and not a few go abroad; and it is thus the stationary na-
ture of the population is preserved.

	There are no resident nobility, nor gentlemen of independent
fortune. There are fourteen proprietors of land yielding more than
L. 50 per annum. There is one person fatuous, one insane, two
imbecile, and two blind.
                	IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture.--On the subject of agriculture, I am sorry to say
that little has been done except in the management of stock, but
still more sorry to think that not a great deal can be done profit-
ably. Of 60,000 or 70,000 acres, the contents of the parish, not
more than 1200 are under tillage, and not much more than an-
other 1000 could be brought into an improved state, with repay-
ment of expense and profit to the tenant.
	Plantations.--The indigenous trees are ash and alder, and would
thrive and be useful, if protected; but they lie open to sheep and
cattle, in a neglected state. The late Lord Alloway, and Mr James
Fergusson, Advocate, made some plantations of larch, ash, and
oak, which are in a thriving state, and already serviceable, proving
what might be done.
	Rent of Land.--The value of the arable land is not more than
L. 1 per acre: a summer's grass for a cow costs L. 2, 5s.; and
the grazing of a ewe for a year, 4s. Wool costs 8s. 6d. a stone;
lint, 10s. per stone; oats from L. 1 to L. 1, 4s. per quarter; bar-
ley, L. 1, 10s.; and potatoes, 7s. per boll of 8 bushels.
