clean, makes a most delightful walk from one end of the 
wood to the other.  One may walk for the space of two
miles together, enjoying all the way the charms both of wood
and water, in their utmost perfection.  On the other side of
the Annan, the hill of Woodcockair rises from the river, in
a pretty steep ascent, for about a mile, and is covered with
one of the finest woods in the south of Scotland.  This is
an object, to those on the opposite side, at once pleasant,
from the beauty which it exhibits, and comfortable, from
the shelter which it affords.  Mention has already been made
of the large plain in the body of the parish:  The road from
Dumfries to Carlisle by Ecclessechan runs through it.  On
each side of the road, this plain is divided into inclosures,
fenced with hedges, and intersperfed with clumps of oak
and ash.  To the traveller coming from Dumfries, who has
to pass through a wild, bleak, hilly tract of country, this vale,
at first view, appears like a paradise.
