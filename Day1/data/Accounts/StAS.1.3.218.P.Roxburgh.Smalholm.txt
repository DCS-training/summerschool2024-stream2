     Statistical Account

years 1739 and 1740, 1800 acres of lands in run-rig were 
divided, and let into large farms.  The villages and houses
formerly possessed by the small farmers, have fallen down, and
the lands are let to one sixth part of the former number of
tenants.  This is one certain cause of the  decrease of the num-
bers of people in many places.  Another is, young men going
to the army and navy, many of whom never return.  It was
computed, that, during the two last wars, 70,000 men were
recruited or raised in Scotland.  It is also reckoned, besides
those who have gone to North America, and to the East or
West Indies, that 10,000 journeymen wrights, carpenters,
bakers, gardeners, and taylors, etc. go yearly from Scotland
to London.  Many of them emigrate from this part of the
country, failing from Berwick and Newcastle, where the
passage is short and frequent, and the freight easy.

     Population.-In 1700, the number of inhabitants was 600;
in 1743, the examination roll was 457; in 1790 it decreased
more than 100.  In Dr Webster's report the number of souls is
stated at 551.  One effect of the diminution of the numbers,
is, in many places, to raise the price of labour.  In 1744, day-
labourers here had 5 d. or 6 d. a day without victuals; now they
have 6 d. or 8 d. and victuals, and 10 d. or 1 s. without them.
The number of examinable persons, who are inrolled after
they are seven or eight years old, is 335; of these 150 are
males, and 185 females.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The public roads from south
to north, through the middle of the parish, were made by
act of parliament, and are supported by the tolls.  A good 
part of the parish is inclosed, and is let at 10 s. the English
acre.  Since 1744, the wages of ordinary or houshold ser-
vants are doubled, and are  now from L. 6 to L. 8 a man ser-
vant in the year, and L. 3 or L. 4 a woman servant.
