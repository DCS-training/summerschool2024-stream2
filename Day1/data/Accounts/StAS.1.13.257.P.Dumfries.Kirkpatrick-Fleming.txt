are large and valuable; while, on the other hand, a very
considerable part is small and of low value.  Besides
work-horses, a great number of young are likewise kept,
and about 90 foals are annually bred in the parish.  Of
late, considerable attention has been paid both to the breed
of horses and black cattle, formerly too much neglected.
There are only a few sheep kept in this parish, and these
are chiefly of the Eskdale breed.

   Exports and Imports.-Though far distant from the ut-
most extent of improvement at which it is capable of ar-
riving, this parish, besides maintaining its own inhabitants,
makes very considerable exports; consisting of the follow-
ing articles, and the the following amount, as nearly as can
be ascertained.  The articles imported into the parish, are,
iron, coals, earthen and stone ware, liquors, and all other
goods retailed by the shopkeepers, of which neither the
value nor quantity can be precisely determined.
