Stirlingshire.  Several of the inhabitants of the town are
constantly employed in driving coals. The carts they use
are of the single kind chiefly.  The price of this article
has risen considerably of late.  This arises partly from all
increase of the original charge, and partly from an addi-
tional demand for driving.  The first has been raised 2 d.
the load, the other from 2 s. 8 d. to 3 s. 5 d. the single cart.
That there are mines of coal in the parish, cannot be
doubted. Some recollect these brought both from Bon-
side and Bonnyton, on the N. E. of the town.  The bo-
rough muir, the lands belonging to the kirk-session and
guildry, are believed to contain coal; and as there places
lie near the town, a supply from them would be of signal
advantage.  Early in this century, one Peck took a lease
of the burrowmuir, engaging, in the event of success, to
pay 100 l. annually, and furnish the inhabitants of the
town with coal at 3 d. the load. Though he failed in the
attempt, either from want of skill or perseverance, abili-
ties and exertion employed there, or upon the session and
guildry grounds would, in all probability, conduce both to
the benefit of the adventurer and the good of the public.
There is also coal on Mr.  Stewart of Binny's estate, which,
with a mixture of the large kind, produced excellent fires,
though it has not been wrought for several years. The
lime-stone, in the S. of the parish, is well known, and
universally allowed to be good. Free-stone is scarce.  The
quarries lie at a distance from the town, and are little used
at present.
   In the southern extremity of the parish is a silver mine,
said, in former times, to have been a considerable source
of wealth to the Haddington family, who were once pro-
prietors of it.  Silver taken from it was also coined here
during the residence of the royal family, and some of the
