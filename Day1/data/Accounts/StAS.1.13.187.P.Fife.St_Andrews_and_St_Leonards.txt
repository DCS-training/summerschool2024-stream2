     PARISHES OF ST ANDREW'S, AND OF ST

     Name, Burgh, University, etc.

   THE parish derives its name from the city of St An-
drew's, formerly the seat of the primate of Scotland,
and also of the prior of St Andrew's whose revenue great-
ly exceeded that of any other churchman in Scotland.  The
revenue of the archbishop in 1651, was money Ster-
ling, L. 242: 0: 7 2/12; wheat, bolls 489; bear, bolls 466;
and oats, bolls 1072: and that of the prior in the same
year, was money Sterling, L. 186: 9: 10 1/12; wheat bolls,
bog-bear, bolls 2119; oats, bolls 2426; meal, bolls 1827;
and pease, bolls 55.  These two benefices were conjoined
in 1635, and the united revenue would now, at a moderate
conversion of the victual, amount to nearly L. 6000 Ster-
