church, are a fine rich loam.  From the church to the Clyde,
towards the north-east, the soil is in general a strong deep
clay; and when properly cultivated is exceeding fertile.  At
the northern extremity, which is surrounded by the Clyde,
and where the banks become low, there is a flat that consists
chiefly of a sandy soil.  From the church, towards the south
end of the parish, the soil is clay, but more light and free,
than that in the lower part; and is in general of a very poor
quality.  In advancing farther from the church, towards the
southern extremity, the foil becomes gradually more of a mos-
sy nature; and, at last, terminates in a deep peat moss.

   Rivers.-Blantyre is bounded on the north, and north-east,
for the extent of about two miles and a half, by the Clyde;
which abounds with excellent salmon, trouts, pikes, pars, &c.
The exclusive privilege of fishing salmon, belongs to the diffe-
rent proprietors, whose lands are contiguous to the river; but
they are seldom caught in such plenty, as to become any great
object for the market.-A considerable part of the banks are
covered with wood; and, from the gentle bendings of the ri-
ver, they form many beautiful and romantic prospects.-
Clyde is not navigable above Glasgow.

   Mineral Springs.-There is a mineral spring in this parish,
the water of which is frequently and successfully used, for
sore eyes, scorbutic disorders, and a variety of other complaints.
The water is sulphureous; it is very strongly impregnated,
and is accounted the best of the kind in this part of the coun-
try.  About fifty years ago, it was the common summers resort
of many families from Glasgow : but from the changes of fa-
shion, so frequent in relation to such objects of medical regi-
men, it is now almost totally deserted.
