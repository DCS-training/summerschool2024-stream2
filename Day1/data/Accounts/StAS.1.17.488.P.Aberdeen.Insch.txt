prejudicial to the morals of the inhabitants of the village.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no plantations of
woods nor hardly any thing that deserves the name of an
inclosure, as there are neither hedges, nor stone fences, which
deserve to be noticed.  The distance from Aberdeen, and
the short leases, added to the want of capital in the farmers,
are great disadvantages to a district naturally fertile.  The
carrying a canal to Insch from Aberdeen, and granting long
leases, with periodical rises of rent, and advancing money
to purchase lime, free of interest for two years, would soon
render this parish, and the district of Garioch, antiently cal-
led the granary of Aberdeen, one of the most valuable dis-
tricts in North Britain.
