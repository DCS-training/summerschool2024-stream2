   Face of the Country.-The two valleys in the height of the
parish are surrounded on each side by mountains which rise
almost by a perpendicular ascent to a prodigious height.  The
farther they retire from the sea, their elevation seems to de-
crease, or rather appears less striking.  In many places, these
mountains are rocky, and covered with heath and bent to the
very summits; but the interjacent valleys are not unpleasant,
being covered with fine and coarse grass, and some wood;
but the proportion of arable ground is very inconsiderable.
The lower part of the parish is all covered with green, and
intermixed with heath and bent.  Here the proportion of
arable ground is somewhat greater.

   Number of Farms, Management, and mode of Cultivation.-
In the parish are 17 farms, each of which, with the excep-
tion of two, is occupied by a number of tenants; so that each
farm forms a village.  The tenants graze their cattle promis-
cuously, each restricting himself to a number of heads, pro-
portioned to his rent; and the arable ground they occupy in
like manner.
   It does not always happen that the farm is equally divided
among the occupiers; and, when one man's division is not
large enough to enable him to keep as many horses (which is
always four, and they never use oxen) as are sufficient to draw
the plough, two or more of them join.
   In some places, particularly along the coast, the arable
ground is so steep, and frequently so small in extent, that ei-
ther the horses cannot stand firm, or have not room enough
to turn upon it with the draught; in which case, the ground
is turned by a machine, called the crooked spade, in a man's
hand.
   The old Scotch plough, and no other, is used.  The horses
go all a-breast; that is, the four horses are tied by the hal-
