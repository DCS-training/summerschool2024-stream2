	Manufactures.--The principal, indeed the only staple manufac-
ture of the parish, is the weaving of coarse linens, called Osna-
burghs. Along with this, some occarinnal work is done in sheeting
and shirting, but chiefly for private use. Many of the families en-
gaged in this work have small farms, held either in lease or feu,
which they cultivate at their leisure hours. There is a spinning-
mill in the Den of Letham, moved by the water of Vinney, for
spinning lint and tow into yarn. This mill is furnished with a steam-
engine to move the machinery when the water is deficient. But I
understand they have had no occasion to have recourse to steam
these several years past. Formerly, spinnng was the peculiar
province of the women. But since the spinning-mills have become
so numerous, they have betaken themselves to weaving, and there
are nearly as many women now employed at the loom as men. Al-
though some attempts have been made to introduce power-looms,
they have not been found to answer for the coarse fabrics of this
district. All weaving is done by the piece. At present, every
person who is willing to work finds employment. There is, how-
ever, a general, complaint of the lowness of wages, although none
of the highness of provisions.
