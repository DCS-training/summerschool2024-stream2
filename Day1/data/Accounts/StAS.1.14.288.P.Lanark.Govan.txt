     Statistical Account

in the greater part of the parish is drawn by 2 horses*;
and it has, of late, been found, that 2 harrows, so con-
structed and joined together, as to take an equal hold of
the ground, may be drawn by 2 such horses managed
by one man, and do nearly as much execution as 4 un-
connected with one another, drawn by 4 smaller horses,
which require 2 men.  From the richness of the pasture,
in general, it is likewise found expedient to keep milch-
cows, of a pretty large size.  The number annually fat-
tened in the parish, is not great.  They are of a smaller
size, and are usually brought from the Highlands.  There
is only 1 sheep farm in the parish, which consists of about
108 acres.  The inundations of the Clyde prevent it
from being profitably kept in tillage.
   As a consequence of the spirit for farming that has
been introduced into Govan, it is entitled to notice, that
the implements of husbandry are all of the most approv-
ed kind.  Instead of possessing that aversion to innova-

the farmers, in general, so far as the writer of this has
had an opportunity of observing, discover a luadable e-
mulation to be foremost on improvement of every kind.
Of the threshing machines invented by the ingenious
Mr. Meikle, the first in this part of the country was e-
rected more than 4 years ago, by a Mr. John Paterson
of this parish; and a considerable farmer in the neigh-
bourhood having seen from his, their great utility in the 
abridgement of labour, has lately followed his example.
   The valued rent of the whole parish is 49621. 175. 7d.
Scotch.  Its real rent, owing to a number of the heri-
tors farming their own lands, is not accurately known;
but from the very advanced state of improvement, must
