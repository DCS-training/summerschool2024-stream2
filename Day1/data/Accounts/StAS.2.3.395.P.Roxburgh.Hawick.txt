a silver penny of Alexander  IIL, on the obverse side of which is
a profile of the King, wearing an open crown of three fleurs-de-lxs,
holding a sceptre, and surrounded with the legend " Alexander
Dei Gra," whilst on the reverse side is a broad cross extending to
the edge of the coin, each quarter of the cross containing a pierced
star, circumscribed with the words " Scotorum Rex." It is re-
markable that this coin, though found in an exposed situation, and
struck nearly 600 years ago, is still in the highest state of preser-
vation.
    There was likewise found on the borders of the parish a fibula,
made apparently either of jet or cannel coal, and bearing a fine
polish.  It is conjectured that this material was used by the abo-
rigines of the country in the manufacture of various articles pre-
vious to the introduction of metals, and probably about the same
period when it was customary to make use of stones for the con-
struction of axes, hammers, arrow-heads, and articles of a similar
description.
  It may also be added, that a cairn which had long stood on the
"auld caknow," about two miles distant from the town, was removed
about thirty years ago.  At the depth of six or eight feet from the
surface of the ground, there were several large stones set on edge,
somewhat in the form of a rude coffin, and enclosing a human
skull, with several bones of a more than ordinary size.  It being
well known that the Celtic tribes were in the practice of adopting this
mode of sepulture, at least with persons of note, it is highly pro-
bable that these were the remains of one of their distinguished
chiefs.  Sepulchral urns have likewise been dug up in the upper
district of the parish, which, though considered to be Roman, are
more likely, from their rude construction, to be the relics of a more
barbarous and less enlightened people.
