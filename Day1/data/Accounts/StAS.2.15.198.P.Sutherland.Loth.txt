	pedition, Loth, being a border parish, was exposed to all the sud-
 	den inroads and craichs arising from the hostility which the inha-
	bitants of two adjoining districts, separated by a marked natural-
	barrier, such as Sutherland and Caithness are, fostered against
	each other, before the blessings of regular government and the
	impartial administration of equal laws, were experienced; and the
	parish also suffered very much from the lawless depredations
	committed by fugitives, and persons of desperate character, who
	sought for temporary shelter amidst the solitary recesses of the
	Ord; and the tales still, or very lately, lingering in the neigh-
	bourhood, with reference to these freebooters between the two
	counties, agree in spirit and tendency, with the sympathy expres-
	sed in some of the popular ballads of the period, in such terms, as,

	                   Alas! that e'er such Iwere made,
	                      To bang a man for gear;
		             Either for stealing cow or sheep,
	                      Or yet for horse or mare:
	                   Had not the laws then been so strict,
		                I had never lost my joy;
	                   But now he lodge with Auld Nick
	                     That hanged my Gilderoy."

           But, notwithstanding the existence of this popular feeling, it is
	stated in Sir Robert Gordon's History, that, in the year 1617, a
	gibbet was erected on the top of the Ord, where "some notable
	robbers that exercised all kynd of tbift, and other misdemeanors
	in Southerland, Catteynes, and Rosse, were hanged."
	   The disastrous battle of Floudden was fought on 9th Septem-
	ber 1513, and, shortly before then, a gallant body of Caithness-
	men, headed by their Earl, marcbed through this parish on their
	way to join the Scottish army. These brave men and their lead-
	er met with an honourable death on the field of battle; but as
	they happened, when leaving Caithness, to cross the Ord on a
	Monday, and were dressed, in a green uniform, there still exists a
	popular aversion among the natives of the district, to take a
	journeys over the Ord on that day of the week, or in a green-co-
	loured boat.
	   Passing over those other historical events connected with this
	parish, which are already before the public, in Sir Robert Gor-
	don's History, the next prominent occurrence was the appearance
	of about 700 Argyle Highlanders on their march into Caithness,
	in the summer of 1679, in order to support th King's patent to
	the Earldom of Caithness, which had been granted on 28th June
	1677, in favour of John Campbell of Glenorchy, afterwards creat-
