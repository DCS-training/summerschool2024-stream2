about 40 persons on the poors roll of whom receive a
trisling supply twice in the year; the most necessitous get 
as often as their exigencies require and the state of the 
funds will admit.  The only funds for their support, and
for paying the session-clerk and officer, are the weekly col-
lections, which are very small; together with what arises
from penalties, the use of 2 mortcloths, the rent of a small
lost in the church, in the interest of 1000 merks Scots of
mortified money; all which, for these 9 or 10 years past,
have amounted to L. 16 or L. 17 sterling yearly, at an
average.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The people in general are healthy,
but there are few instances of longevity.  Some years ago,
a woman in the parish died at the age of 100.  There are
a few persons still living about 80.  The most common 
distempers are the hooping cough, measles, and small pox;
fevers sometimes make their appearance, consumptions ve-
ry rarely; among old men, stone and gravel are very pre-
valent.  Inoculation for the small pox has not yet become
general throughout the parish.  In one corner, ( on Kindy
side), it has a different times been practised with great suc-
cess, owing chiefly to the influence and attention of the pro-
prietor.  The parishioners at large do not seem to entertain
any prejudice against inoculation, if they could afford the
expense.  There is a chaly beate spring at Glencorny; but
it is little attended to, though it is said to be nothing in-
ferior to some elsewhere, that are in good repute.
