   of the water. North Leith originally belonged to the parish of
Holyroodhouse, from which it was disjoined and erected into
a separate parish in the year 1606.  It then comprehended
only the village of North Leith, and the coal hill, which are a
part of the barony of Broughton; but, in the year 1630, the
baronies of Newhaven and Hillhoufe-field, which belonged
to the parish of St. Cuthberts or West Kirk, were annexed to
it.
   The parish is of an oblong figure, extending along the sea
shore about an English mile in length, and is a quarter of a mile
in breadth; it is bounded by the Firth of Forth, on the north,
by the parish of St. Cuthberts on the west, and by South Leith,
on the south and east.  The face of the country is flat, and its
soil light and sandy; but with the dung procured from the
town, it produces wheat, barley, clover and potatoes.  It is
all inclosed.  There are properly no farms in the parish; a
few gardeners rent the most of it, and give about L. 3: 10 per
acre.  The whole lands do not exceed 170 acres, of which
there may be about 20 in kitchen gardens.  The only heritor
is Mr Robertson of Lady-kirk.  The rest are feuars, who
hold of the trinity-house Leith.
   The air, in general, is sharp, clear and healthy; the place
has been much frequented, of late years, for sea bathing, and
a number of houses has been erected for the accommodation
of strangers. In the months of April and May, an east wind
generally prevails, which occasions damp and foggy weather.

   Population.-In the year 1745, the number of inhabitants

up a roll of them every year, in course of ministerial visitation,
and finds the souls amount at present to about 2400.  This
year, 1791, the number of families is 642, and the indivi-
duals are 2400, of which 1350 are females, and 1059 are
