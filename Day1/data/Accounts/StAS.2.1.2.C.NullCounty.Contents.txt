been presented on the different branches of the inquiry. This part
of the plan it has been judged expedient, in the circumstances, to
resign; first, because it is, in a great measure, superseded by the sum-
mary (in some instances ample and explicit) which has been ap-
pended to each of the County collections: and next , because the
purpose has been still further answered by a copious index, and by
the degree in which it has been found practicable to arrange the
matter of the several Accounts, uniformly, under a few distinct
heads.
 If the work has exceeded the limits first proposed, this is to be
ascribed to the circumstance, that many of the clergy addressed
themselves to the task with more zeal and research, and with
greater stores of information on the various subjects of inquiry,
than could have been anticipated at the commencement. The
Committee might have noticed also, with some solicitude on this
point, their own limited privilege of abridgment, (limited by the
terms, on which the contributions were both asked and given;) were
they not assured that the enlargement of the work beyond the ex-
tent first intended, has been fully compensated by the greater inte-
rest and value it has thus received.
 The Society were led, as they formerly stated, to engage in this
undertaking by the circumstance of their having possessed the pro-
perty of the first Statistical Account, which was conveyed to them
by its benevolent and public-spirited projector. This, and the re-
lation in which they stood to the Church, seemed to afford them
an opportunity of doing a farther service to the public, by means
of a new Account adapted to the present circumstances of the
country. The proposal to obtain such an Account was first made
to them by their Secretary, Sir Henry Jardine.
 It is not exactly their part to estimate the value of the work
which thus originated, or to determine how far its object has been
attained. But, as it is truly the production of the clergy, the
Committee may be permitted to observe, that the Church of Scot-
land appears to them to have here furnished a compilation which
must long be regarded as a monument of the intelligence of its
clergy, and of that varied and intimate acquaintance with the af-
fairs, history, condition, and resources of their parishes, which the
