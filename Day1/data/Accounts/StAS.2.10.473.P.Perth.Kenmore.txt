pose, by being at once too steep and too shallow for the plough,
and so unproductive as scarcely to yield a return of three. Per-
haps one sixth of the land at present tilled may be of this cha-
racter, which it were far better to convert to the state of perma-
nent pasture. There are no undivided commons with reference to
landlord and landlord; but there is abundance of them as to one
tenant and another; it being no unusual thing, though the prac-
tice is now fast wearing out, for four, six, or even eight occupants
of a hamlet to send their cattle to one upland common. There
may about 5400 acres be in tillage; 8600 in permanent pasture;
21,000 in moor and hill; and, 5000 in wood. The land in til-
lage may be rated at 16s. per acre, though it is no easy matter to
determine this point, because to every arable holding there is
attached a correspondidg allowance, both of outfield pasture and
of hill grazing, for the whole of which there is one undivided rent.
The rate mentioned, however, must be near the mark. The
pasture may be rated at 6s., and the moor and hill at 2s. per acre;
so that, by this mode of reckoning, the rental would be, as in
fact it nearly is, as follows;

<TABLE>
         5400 acres in tillage at 16s. per acre,            L. 4320
         8600 acres in pasture at 6s. per do.                  2580
        21000 acres in moor and hill at 2s. per do.            2100
         5000 acres in wood; natural and planted,               360

       40,000 acres.                                 Rental, L.9360

  The return from the woods is here stated to be, one year with
another, L.360. But so rich in fine timber are now the plant-
ings of Taymouth, and so much of valuable natural wood, parti-
cularly ash, skirts the lake, and covers the numerous ravines on
either side, that a much larger revenue might annually be derived
from this source, without damage to either the worth or appear-
ance of these places. The value of the woods themselves can
hardly be estimated under L.75,000. The distribution of the
cultivated land, as to cropping, may stand nearly thus:

<TABLE>
                3100 acres in oats; chiefly the late white.
                1048 acres in bear; Cheater.
                 640 acres in potatoes; large Perthshire red.
                 306 acres in turnips, peas, rye, lint.
                 306 acres in sown grass.

  The live-stock is nearly as follows:
       521.horses; 3109 blwk cattle; 12,050 sheep; 500 swine.
  Rent.-The average rent of grazing for a horse per annum is
about L.2, 10s.; for a cow, L.1, 2s.; and for a full grown sheep, 4s.
