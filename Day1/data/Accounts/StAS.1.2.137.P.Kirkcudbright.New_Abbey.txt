   Number of Cattle, etc.-The upper or hilly division of
the parish is applied chiefly to pasture for sheep and black cattle;
of the former there may be about 3500, and of the latter 1000.
There are of the true Galloway breed, were formerly of a
small size, but are much improved of late years, by paying
greater attention to the size and shape both of the bulls and
cows.  The sheep are of the short small kind, but improving in
size.  Their wool is not fine, nor are their sleeces large; they are
salved or smeared with tar and butter; 8 sleeces, at an average,
go to the stone of 24 lbs. avoirdupois, which has sold, for 10
years past, from 4 s. 6 d. to 6 s.  The price of wool has been
rising for the 3 last years.  The mutton, when fat, and kept
to four years old, is exceedingly nice, of a rich red juice, and
fine flavour, and may then weigh 10 or 11 lb. per quarter, and
will yield from 4 to 6 lb. of 24 oz. of tallow.  But the hills of
this parish produce very little good, fat, and old mutton, since the
farmer has found it more to his advantage to feed his sheep bet-
ter, and to sell them young.  The number of work-horses is about
130, and of young horses 30.  They are greatly improved of
late, by paying attention to their breed, and are very hardy,
and fit for labour.

   Minerals and Fuel.-Crissell affords plenty of granite;
exceedingly fit for building, both in point of strength and
beauty.  There are some appearances of coal in the lower end of
the parish; and a slight trial to find it was made a few years
ago, but without success.-The fuel made use of is in ge-
neral peat; but moss is not plenty, and mostly the property
of one heritor; whose tenants alone have the liberty of mak-
ing peats.  All others who can procure that privilege, must pay
