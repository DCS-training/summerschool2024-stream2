   Population.-In the village of Inchture are 84 families,
and about 360 souls.  There is a probability that this vil-
lage and parish will soon become more populous.  In the
course of these 17 years past, it has increased about 24
families; and as the turnpike-road between Perth and
Dundee, which is just now making, goes through this
town, Lord Kinnaired, who is sole proprietor of it, intends
to enlarge and improve it.  There are only other 5 villages
in the parish, and in them are about 100 families, and a-
bout 640 souls.  So that, in the parish, there are in all
about 184 families, and 1000 soul; of these, about 250
under 10 years of age.  The return to Dr Webster was
893 souls.  The number of males and females in nearly
equal.  Some years ago, this parish was more populous
than it is at present; but the decrease has been owing to
some lands being converted into pleasure grounds.  In some
years of late, there have been 18 or 19 marriages; at a
medium, these last 16 years, there have been 14 yearly.
There have been, in the same space of time, at a medium,
39 basptims.  In the same place of time, there have been,
in some years, 20 deaths; but the medium for the last 7
years is 18.
