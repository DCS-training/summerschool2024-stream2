   The branches of instruction taught in the institution are, the
knowledge of objects, English reading and writing, arithmetic,
geography, and the principles of religion.
   In 1834, Mr Taylor, having resigned the direction ofthe insti-
tution, Mr Matthew R. Burns, himself deprived of bearing at a
very early age, was appointed in his room; and his sister, Miss
Burns, was appointed housekeeper.  At the time, some of the di-
rectors felt a doubt whether Mr Burns's deafness might not prove
an obstacle to his usefulness, while others were rather of opinion
that, by placing him more closely on a par with his pupils, it would
be an advantage.
   Respecting the result, it is unnecessary to say more than that,
by his ability, zeal, and unwearied diligence, the pupils have been
benefited in no common degree, and the character of the institution
(which depends entirely on that of the teacher,) has been raised
to the level of those excellent and more extensive institutions of the
same kind in Edinburgh, London, and Dublin.  The period of a pu-
pil's continuance in the institution is usually about five years.  The
number at present receiving aid from the funds is 12, viz. 9 boys and
3 girls.  The expenditure is provided for by annual subscriptions,
occasional donations, the sale of work done in the institution, and
by the proceeds of an annual public examination of the pupils ; and
the sums thus obtained have been sufficient, with great economy,
to provide for the maintenance of a limited number of pupils; but
the institution is very far from meeting the necessities of the north
of Scotland, as was contemplated at its original establishment.
   The following table shows the income and expenditure, with
the number of pupils whose board was partly paid out of the
funds, for the last seven years.

   Burnett's Fund.-In the year 1783, Mr John Burnett of Dens
died, bequeathing the bulk of his property to the following cha-
ritable purposes : Two-thirds of the rents of Kinnadie for the sup-
port of aged and diseased poor persona in Aberdeen, with a spe-
cial reference to their previous respectability and moml character.
This distribution (the amount of which was about L. 250: annually)
was directed to be continued as long as there should be legal
assessment for the support of the poor of Aberdeen; but in the
event of an assessment being levied, then, during each year of
