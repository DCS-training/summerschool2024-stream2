   Church.-The church of Irvine is beautifully situated on
the summit of a rising ground, to the south of the town, and
nigh to the river*.  It is an oblong square of 80 feet in
length, by 60 in breadth.  The lofts form an octagon in the
inside, and, gradually ascending, place every hearer in full
view of the preacher.  At each angle there is a massy pillar
of wood from the ground-floor to the roof of the church.
The area below is neatly fitted up with pews, all of them
facing the pulpit.  Three-fourths of the church were built
by the magistrates, and one-fourth by the other heritors.

tending from the pulpit, on the north-west, to the south-
east door, the partitions of which form the ends of said
seats, and are moveable at pleasure.  These seats are the pro-
perty of the session, and yield from 8 l. to 9 l. annually.-

an overplus of near 300 l.  This sum they laid out, with an
addition of near 500 l. more, in building a very elegant
