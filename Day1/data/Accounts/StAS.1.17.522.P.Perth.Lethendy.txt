Towards the east, the soil becomes blacker, more wet, and
less productive.  From the southern exposure of the parish,
the climate is perhaps a little milder than that of the parishes
immediately adjoining.  The difference, however, is not ma-
terial.  Harvest commences usually in the beginning of Sep-
tember, and is over by the middle of October.

   State Agriculture.-Thirty years ago, the best lands in
the parish were under sheep pasture, and from a bad breed,
and probably unskilful management, yielded but a poor pit-
tance to the proprietor, and but a very scanty subsistence to
the tenant.  Since that periods sheep have been banished
entirely; the use of marl has been adopted; the waste lands
have been cultivated; the rental of the parish trebled; the
condition of the tenants meliorated; and the face of the
country entirely changed.  But rapid as this improvement
has been, it was much longer of having reached its present
states than a judicious treatment of the soil would have
brought it.  This obstruction is principally to be ascribed, to
a mistake respecting the qualities of marl; and an error in
the system of cropping.  Experience has now proved, that
there is no nutritive quality in marl, that it acts only as a
stimulus to the soil, which, if not enriched with different
manure, it soon exhausts, and reduces to a state of absolute
sterility.  Want of attention to this circumstance, consider-
ably retarded the improvements in agriculture in this, as well
as in many other parts of the country.  The lands, when first
marled, produced abundantly for several years without any
other manure; and, while they continued to do so, were kept
in a state of constant village, and oats frequently sown in perpe-
tual succession.  From this improper management, the nutri-
tious part of the soil was exhausted, and required a rest of
