offices are now in good order, as are also the school and
school-house.  There is one established school in the parish,
in which reading English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping,
and some branches of mathematics are taught.  From 30 to
50 scholars attend, according to the season of the year.  The
present teacher, who has long taught successfully, lately ob-
tained a small augmentation of salary; but even with this
addition, it is only 200 merks.  The school fees are, per
quarter, 1 s. for reading English; 1 s. 6 d. for writing, arith-
metic, and Latin.  The whole emoluments, exclusive of a
free house, do not exceed 22 l. a year, a reward by no means
adequate to the abilities and application of so important an office.
There is one charity school occasionally taught in the head
of the parish.  In the winter season, these are two or three
private schools kept up by the tenants, in corners remote
from the parochial school.

   Poor.-There are no begging poor belonging to the parish.
For many years past, the average number on the poor's roll has
been 14.  The heritors and kirk-session meet twice a year to set-

ding to their respective circumstances.  They also receive occasi-
onal donations, especially in winter.  Occasional charities are
likewise given to individuals, and families not on the roll,
which is attended with good effects, and often prevents them
from coming on it.  The fund for the support of the poor
arises from the interest of a small stock, from the collections at
the church doors, from the dues of the mort-cloths, and from
the rent of the seats in the galleries of the church, amount-
ing in all to about 35 l. Sterling.  The sum expended has
not varied very much for these 16 years past, except in 1783,
when it was much greater, than in any other year of the pe-
riod mentioned.  The members of the kirk-session are very
