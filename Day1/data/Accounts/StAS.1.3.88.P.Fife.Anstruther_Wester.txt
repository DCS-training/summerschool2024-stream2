miles, at any time between Christmas and Candlemas; they
were obliged to lead the proprietors coals during the sum-
mer; besides a stated number of other carriages, such as
stone, lime, and timber; if required, they paid a certain
number of hens and chickens, and they were allowed to
subset or let off part of their farms to interior tenants.  In
many places the proprietor drew the teind on the field.  No
tenant, however favoured, was allowed to lead any part of his
corn, till the whole was ready; and in some places they
were obliged to make the barley into malt, and to pay their 
rent in the grain thus manufactured.  The great prices of 
cattle and grain, and the marker of Glasgow, of late opened
to this county, by the canal, which takes off vast quantities
of wheat, barley, and beans, have given a four to industry,
which, joined to the improved made of culture, have mello-
rated the face of the country, and added to the wealth of the
farmers.  It is well known, that this country was visited with
a great famine in the year 1699.  It had been preceded by
some years of late and rather scanty crops, and it was at-
tended with a great mortality.  From an account published
in the beginning of this century, and from tradition, it is
probable, that in some parishes nearly one third of the in-
habitants died.  The only manufactures exported, are Olna-
burgs and green linen.  There are three ale-houses in the
parish, which do not seem to have any bad effect on the
morals of the people.  The peculiar disadvantages of the pa-
rish are, the encroachments of the sea, and the harbour not
admitting ships of burden.  The people in general are fober
and industrious.  They enjoy in a reasonable degree the 
comforts and advantages of society, and are contented with
their situation.
