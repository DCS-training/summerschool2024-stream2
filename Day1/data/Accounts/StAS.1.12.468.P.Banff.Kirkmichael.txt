their heads, sometimes their shoulders, drawn forward by
their hands, surrounded on each side by a fold.  These, as
fashion varied, were succeeded by barred plaids, or blankets,
where different colours blended, crossing each other at right
angles, somewhat distant, and bearing a square space in the
middle.  Wearied of barred plaids, they betook themselves
to Stirling ones, and now duffle cardinals begin to have the
ascendant.  Formerly their hair flowed in easy ringlets over

   Manner of Living.-Not more than 50 years ago, their
mode of living in this country was different from what it is

more numerous than formerly; yet they are chiefly the pro-

hills and glens lie more convenient.  In the centrical places,
the farms are enlarged, at least as much as the nature of the
ground can admit; consequently the smaller tenants are fewer,
and live less at their ease:  but previous to the above period,

fold is kept sacred for the market, in order to make money
to supply the exigencies of the family, and satisfy the many
demands to which it is exposed, from bad seasons, precarious
crops, and increasing taxes:  besides that, the luxury of the
