that, before the necessary steps can be taken to bring him up, a
hint is perhaps conveyed to him of what is going on, and he re-
moves to a different county, or plunges into one of our large com-
mercial towns, where it becomes almost impossible, or, at all events,
very troublesome and expensive to trace him; insomuch that the
session is induced rather to provide for the deserted family than
to expend money in a fruitless search after the parent. Even if
he is discovered and subjected to a short imprisonment, his main-
tenance during his confinement, in addition to that of his family,
falls on the parish; and no sooner is he set at liberty, than, in all
probability, he again decamps, setting at defiance the claims of
humanity and justice, and the terrors of the law.
	Independently of the additional burden thus unfairly imposed on
the poor's fund, there is something so revolting to every right feel-
ing in thus trampling upon the most sacred ties that bind together
the social system, that the evil (for it is a serious and growing
evil) calls loudly for the consideration of those who may have it in
their power to provide a remedy.
        Fairs.-There are no fairs held within this parish.
        Public-Houses.-The number of public-houses in the parish of
Liff proper is four, situated generally at considerable distances
from each other. In Lochee there are at least twelve, including
shops where spiritr `re sold, both in and out of doors.
