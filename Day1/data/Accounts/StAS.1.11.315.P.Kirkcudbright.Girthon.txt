   School.-There is one school here, very well endowed.  It
is subject of regret, however, that so large a parish has only
one.  This is a great disadvantage to the farmers and cottagers
children, who cannot travel as far as Gatehouse.  What de-
serves commendation is, that the schoolmaster has, though
with little encouragement, opened a Sunday school, for the in-
struction of such children as are obliged, from the straitened
circumstances of their parents, to attend the cotton mille dar-
ing the rest of the week.

   Population and Employments.-At Whitsunday 1792, the
