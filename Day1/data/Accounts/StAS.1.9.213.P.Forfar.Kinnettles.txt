industry and ingenuity of thousands must be lost to the
community, and vice cherished to a considerable degree.
-The decrease of population in country parishes, and the
great resort of people to towns, is an evil much to be re-
gretted.  Though this mode should continue, it is not im-
probable that there may be frill a gradual increase of in-
habitants over Scotland.  But the question is, by which of
these two plans may population be supposed to increase
most; whether, by a well peopled state of country parish-
es, or by extending and crowding the towns.  In all infec-
tious distempers, such as fevers, small-pox, measles, hoop-
ing cough, the danger to children is greatest in towns.  As
to inoculated small pox, the distemper may be introduced
in towns at a favourable season, and, when introduced, it
takes its range of infection, and before its course is finish-
ed, the hot nnfavourable season arrives, and the distemper
generally becomes malignant and fatal.  In the country,
infection from this distemper may be more easily avoided,
and I hope to see whole parishes taking such rational
views of inoculation, as to agree to have all their children,
who have not had the distemper, put under inoculation,
at the same time, during the favourable season; a victory
over prejudice, not to be expected universally in large
towns.  But dropping this consideration, the sickly looks
of many children, in large, crowded, ill situated, or ill con-
structed towns, show that the country is the preferable
place for children.  Inhabitants of large towns are sensible
of this, who rejoice in the opportunity of having them set-
tled in the country, especially after they have been ailing,
as the only means of restoring their health and vigour.
But how is the prevailing resort to towns to be prevented,
when the present taste is, to raze or suffer almost every
