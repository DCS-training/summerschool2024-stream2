     Statistical Account

   Coast, Fish, Harbours, &c.-The coast from Stonehaven
to the N. boundary of the parish, extends nearly 7 English
miles.  It is bold and rocky.  There is one bay, called the
Bay of Stonehaven, which stretches from Downy to Garron
Point, that is, about two miles, In this bay, there is a sal-
mon fishing, the property of Mr. Barelay; and a white fish-
ing, the property of Mr. Innes of Cowie.  Three boats are
employed in this fishing, with fix hands to each boat.  The
fish caught here, are ling, cod, turbot, skate, haddocks, &c.
which are consumed by the people in the neighbourhood.
There are likewise two creeks or small harbours, one at
Muchals, another at Sketraw.  At the former, there were
two fishing-boats, which were lost in a storm about 30 years
ago, and the crews perished, since which time they have not
been replaced.  At the latter, there are 7 boats of much the
same size, and having the same number of hands with those
at Cowie.  The fish caught here are likewise consumed by
the people in the adjacent country.  Here, by the way, it
deserves to be remarked, that a Mr Mackie, lately from the
West Indies, made a purchase of the lands of Sketraw, in
1788, where he has built a very good dwelling-house, and
made very great improvements, having, in the space of 3
years, enclosed with stone fences, and highly cultivated, about
60 Scotch acres, part of which was formerly barren, covered
with heath and furze.  He continues to carry on his im-
provements with great spirit and industry.

   Population.-The population of Fetteresso is not so great
as it was formerly, though it is still somewhat higher than it
was 40 years ago.  By an exact survey taken in 1764, the
number was 3500.  The return to Dr. Webster in 1755,
was only 3082.  Increase in 9 years 418.  The number of
souls, in 1790, was 3370.  Decrease in 26 years 130.  In-
