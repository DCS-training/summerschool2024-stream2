upon, either the proprietors land, or the larger tenants, from
whom they are set off, for services or labour performed by the
persons who occupy them.  None of the most considerable
heritors reside in the parish; but almost the whole of the small
proprietors and feuars do.  The junction of farms does not hap-
pen so often as it otherwise might, because the chief part of the
smaller heritors possess their own lands, which have neither in-
creased nor diminished for many years.  There are farms of all
dimensions, from L. 10 to L. l00 per annum.  There are none
above L. 100, possessed by tenants, except 3; and one of
these is rented at L. 300 per annum.  Several heritors, how-
ever, possess their own lands, which would let at above
L. 100 a-year.  The value of sheep farms, may be nearly 3 s
per acre; the arable, from 5 s to 10 s; and the inclosed lands,
from 15 s to above L. 1. This is a great encouragement to
improvement; for which, notwithstanding all that is done,
there is still great room.  The valued rent of the 2 parishes,
is L. 4106: 16 s Scots.  The real rent cannot be so well as-
certained; because many of the heritors having possessed
their own lands from time immemorial, they have not
been let on lease.  The whole rent, however, may be safely
calculated above L. 4000 sterling per annum.  That this is
the case will be evident, when it is considered, that there is,
including both parishes, nearly 30,000 English acres of land.
Allowing 6000 for moss, water, woods, and rocks, there
will still remain 24,000 acres; which, if rented only at 3 s 4 d
per acre, will amount to L. 4000.
   The size or extent of farms, has never been fixed here;
and it would, indeed, be difficult to fix it; as men, no
doubt, would be divided in their opinions.  It would, how-
ever, be for the advantage both of the proprietors, and the
country, that cultivated farms should neither be too large,
nor too small.
