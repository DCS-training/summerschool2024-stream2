   Church proposed.-It is intended to build a chapel of ease in
Oban, as the number of the inhabitants are rapidly increasing,
insomuch, that none of the parish churches can contain them.
The building will be begun, as soon as proper funds are col-
lected for that purpose, and for affording a competent salary
to the preacher.

   School.-There is a very good school-house.  It was built
by the Duke of Argyll, and the inhabitants; who make up
a salary to the schoolmaster of 20 L. a year.  His other emo-
luments are considerable.  The number of scholars, is at an
average, from 40 to 50 through the year.
