Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry is of a supe-
rior order. In reference to this parish in general, it may be ob-
served, that our improvements in agriculture, during the last twenty
years, have been very extensive and that our proprietors are anxious
to give every encouragement to enterprising and substantial te-
nants. The want of capital is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles
to agricultural improvement; and it is generally supposed that an
abatement of rent would operate to the advantage of the landlord
as well as of the tenant. I have already adverted to our quarries
of lime, which exist in great abundance and excellent quality,
and to these must in some degree be ascribed the advances made
in husband in spite of a soil, in many cases, very indifferent.
	Produce.--The gross amount of raw produce raised in the pa-
rish is as follows

	Manufactures.--Our chief manufacture is that of cotton or
linen, which affords employment to 42 heads of families. There is
no peculiarity in the mode of conducting it, but in consequence of
the low prices which have of late prevailed, it has occupied those
who engage in it about ten or twelve hours per day, and this, too,
without affording any thing like a fair remuneration. It is to
hoped, however, that these privations are only temporary, and that
the sober and contented portion of our population who experience
them will ere long meet with that encouragement to which they
are entitled.

			V.PAROCHIAL--ECONOMY.
	Market-town, &c.--There are three villages in this parirh,
Waterbeck, Eaglesfield, and Kittlebridge. The nearest market
town is Ecclefechan. Our means of communication are extremely
good, and we have daily mails from the south and north. The turn-
pike road betwixt London and Glasgow passes through the parish
for two miles, and is frequented by the mail-coach and other car-
riages. Our parish roads, which were formerly almost impassable,
have been improved to an incredible degree within the last twenty
years, and, with our bridges, are now in excellent condition.
