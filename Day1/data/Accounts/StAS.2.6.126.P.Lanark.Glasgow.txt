entrusted with drawing up and classifying the Government popula-
tion returns for 1821, took the same precautions as to births, mar-
riages, burials, and population as in 1831, in the view of being
able to ascertain the ages of the population, and the periods of
life at which death ensued at particular epochs, when the popula-
tion could be accurately ascertained. He states as the result of
his experience, that in all the authentic bills of mortality he had
ever seen, there were more males born than females, but, taking
the population above fifteen years, the number of females prepon-
derates. The following results for Glasgow are derived from the
census of 1831.

	Probability of human life in England.--The want of sufficient
data for the formation of tables relative to the probability of hu-
man life in this country is apparent from a report of a Committee
of the House of Commons, (ordered to be printed on 15th Au-
gust 1833,) on the evidence of persons distinguished by their
knowledge in political science, such as George Mann Burrows,
Esq. Doctor in Medicine; John Bowring, Esq. M. P. Doctor in
Laws; Stacey Grimaldi, Esq. Fellow of the Antiquarian Society; the
Rev. W. Hale Hale, Chaplain to the Bishop of London, and others,
that the public registers in England are so inefficient as to render
it impossible to determine the law of mortality among the working,
classes of the empire, either generally or locally. Mr John Tilley
Wheeler, clerk to the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks, stated,
that in London, the returns for the mortality bill are made up in
each parish by two old pauper women, who are utterly incompe-
tent to give correct information, and frequently receive most falla-
cious reports; and John Finlaison, Esq. the Government Actuary,
they that no faith whatever could be put in bills of mortality as
stated are now prepared. In order to procure an approximation of
the are of mortality which prevails among the working-classes of
this country, that distinguished political inquirer resorted to the
public registers at Ostend in Flanders, where be made an observa-
tion on the mortality of that town for a period of twenty-six years,
endimg in 1832. The result of his investigations was, that in a
