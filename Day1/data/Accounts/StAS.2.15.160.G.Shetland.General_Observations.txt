	160		GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

	   The injurious consequences of indulging in such crude decla-
	mation, however well meant it may in some instances have been,
	were severely felt, in destroying confidence between tenant
	and master, and rendering the former discontented with his lot;
	and this naturally conducts to a few remarks on the leading causes
	of the destitution of the last four years, which has claimed and
	received so much relief from a benevolent British community.
	The more immediate cause, certainly, was a failure of the crops
	and fishing,-the more remote, but not less general or efficient, I
	should suggest, was a departure from the ancient relation between
	landlord and tenant.  A Shetland proprietor holds his lands, it is
	true, by the same tenure as a Scottish; but to insure fair and ade-
	quate returns he must, in most cases, view himself rather as a pro-
	prietor in a new colony (with which, in many points, Shetland is
	assimilated), or, if I may so speak, as the conductor of a compli-
	cated manufactory, than simply as a landholder having little other
	business to transact, besides merely granting leases and receiving
	rents; her must vigilantly excite and direct the energies of his tenants,
	-assist them with capital and counsel,-receive, and provide a mar-
	ket for the various produce of their industry,-keep a store con-
	taining every necessary article they may require, and carefully at-
	tend to the many subordinate arrangements of order and discipline
	which the peculiarity of their position and co-operative industry may
	demand.  He must be at once landlord, merchant, farmer, fish-curer,
	and the banker also of his tenants ; or, if he is not himself able to
	undertake all this, he places his lands under the direction of some
	intelligent and responsible person as tacksman, who, under certain
	restrictions, manages the property as the owner would do.  In
	either way, a close and kindly connexion between tenant and mas-
	ter subsisted,-the one bad all his necessary and reasonable wants
	provided for, and the other had security for his rents, and each had
	a near interest in the other's welfare.  It was the practice, in
	working this system, for the tenant to pay a low rent for his farm,
	and in return to receive a low price for certain parts of his produce,
	especially fish, and this mode of low reciprocal valuation was ob-
	viously more for the benefit of the tenant than the proprietor.
	Under this system the people prospered and were contented,
	and it afforded them facility for gradual and solid improvement;
	but individuals, who either could not or would not see the wisdom
	of this arrangement, in a certain state of society,-entertaining
	theoretical views of political economy, suited only to great capital
