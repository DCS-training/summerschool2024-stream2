     Statistical Account

   Near the machinery employed for the bleaching, is a
flint mill, under the direction of the same person.  The
rough materials are brought chiefly from Gravesend, and
when ground sent partly to Glasgow.  Some of them are
exported to Ireland, and the rest used as a supply for his
own pottery at Westpans in East Lothian.
   Among the articles of trade here, snuff must not be
omitted, as the persons who manufacture it reside in the
town, though the mill they use be in the parish of Muir-
avonside.  They still carry on the business to a considerable
extent, though the demand is not so great as formerly.

   Breweries and Distilleries.-There are three breweries in
town, for porter, ale, and small beer.  The malt liquor
produced here may vie with any in Scotland, and has a
very extensive circulation.  The brewers are all restricted,
to the borough mill, and complain of the heavy multures,
which is a sixteenth part.-There were lately four distil-
leries in the parish.  One very considerable, is removed
to the next parish, on the E.; but some of the previous
operations are still carried on at Broad-law, in the S. of
this parish.  Another, near the towns, has been diconti-
nued this year, but will soon be resumed.  The quantity
distilled here is very great.  The manufacture at Bonny-
ton employs 24 men all the year, 3 female labourers, and
3 female house servants.  From 150 to 180 black cattle
are fed there annually: Of these, generally 100 are at the
stall at one time.

   Bakers-There are several in Linlithgow, who not on-
ly supply the inhabitants of it, but the country around.
The bread is remarkable both for its fine colour and deli-
cate taste.  One baker sends a quantity twice a-week to the
Queensferry, and other places in that direction.
