was the veneration in which the memory of this good man was held
by the people of the surrounding district, that, in selecting a piece
of burying-ground for the parish of Cumnock, the spot where Mr
Peden's ashes lay was made choice of for the purpose, so that
these now lie in the church-yard of Cumnock.
	Dr Matthew Stewart, late Professor of Mathematics in the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh, and so well known over all Europe for his
original genius and high attainments in geometrical science, though
not a native, was a frequent visitor in the parish. At his death his
property came into the possession of his son, the late Professor
Dugald Stew`rt, one of the most distinguished metaphysicians of
his day. Though not generally resident in the parish, in the ear-
lier and more advanced period of his life, Professor Dugald
Stewart spent a portion of his time in it. The house which he
occupied still stands; and individuals still speak with delight ef
his unwearied benevolence, of his kindness and condescension to
all who came within the sphere of his influence, particularly to
those who lie knew had been the objects of his father's regard.
Professor Stewart was succeeded, as an heritor of the parish, by his
son, Lieutenant-Colonel Matthew Stewart, a distinguished soldier
and an accomplished scholar. On a very commanding situation
on his property, and at a short distance from the house which was
occupied by his father, be has built a new dwelling-house, and
laid off the grounds about it with great taste. *

<FOOTNOTE>There is a well authenticated tradition, that King James V. visited Sorn Castle
on, the occasion of the marriage of the daughter of this Treasurer, Sir William Hamil-
ton, to Lord Seaton. It is general belived, that it was while he was on this visit
that his MAjesty set downly a well, about half-way between Glasgow and Sorn, to re-
fresh hinvelf, and hence the nature " King's Well" was given to it.
