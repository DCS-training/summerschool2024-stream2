   Poor.-In a populous parish, where no compulsory assessment is
levied, and where the management of the poor devolves on the
kirk-session, few duties fall to a clergyman which require greater
prudence, caution, and patient investigation, than the application of
the poors funds. Most of my brethren will concur with me in stat-
ing, that in the first two or three years of our incumbency, the per-
sons who draw most freely from the session funds and the minister's
purse are the least deserving objects, and it is only when taught by
experience we become a little more discriminating in our channel.
   In the oldest session record, where any mention is made of the
distribution of money to the poor the receipts from 23d April 1662
to 25th March 1663, were L. 62, 5s. Scots, and the disbursements
L. 137, 8s. Scots; and there was at debt due by the kirk-session of
L. 232, 4s. From that date to the present time, there has been a
number of regular poor on the list. In 1699, the sum of L. 88
Scots, and a few months afterwards L. 95, were distributed among
74 "clamant" poor. In 1733, the collection at the dispensation
of the Sacrament was L. 91, 17s. Scots; and on that occasion, and
on many others both before and after that date, the common beg-
gars received nearly the same allowance the regular poor. Eight
years before that date, in 1725, there were 18 regular poor on the
list, and who occasionally received relief. And a meeting of
the heritors and kirk-session "appoint that any of the said 33
poor persons who shall apply to the minister, and shall be furnish-
ed with certificates, under his hand for charity, are to be served by
the householders within the paroch, according to their several abi-
lities, once a-week, and discharges the inhabitants of the paroch
to serve any others." * That we may compare state of the
poors' funds a hundred years ago with the present expenditure, it
may be farther stated, that from July 1732 to August 1739, the
receipts were L. 3156, 17s. Scots, and the disbursements L. 3086,
19s. The maintenance of an orphan child in 1733 was L. 2 Ster-
ling, and 10s. for clothing; it present, the common allowance is
2s. 6d. a-week. A coffin for a pauper, paid by the kirk-session,
cost 4s. Sterling. The average allowance to a regular pauper
seems to have been 8d. a fortnight. For many years previous to
1760, from L. 60 to L.90 Scots was the collection made at the
sacrament; from that time till the end of the century, about
L. 8 Sterling. At present, the number of poor on the century, is 28;
of these 7 are men, and the remaining 21 women. The allowance
