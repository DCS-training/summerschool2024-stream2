sign of the cross.  According to tradition, a Danish chief was
interred here.  On the top of the Dun of Criech, a hill of
a great height above the level of the sea, and rather jetting out
into the Frith, there are the remains of a rampart.  The walls
have been cemented with a vitrified stuff, something similar
to the refuse of iron in a smith's forge.  The cement is as
hard as a rock. it is said, that this rampart was begun to be
built, in the 12th century, by a Paul M'Tier, a branch of
the noble family of Ross.  At the top of the Kyle, there is
an old castle, supposed to have been a place where justice was
formerly administered.  This conjecture derives some plausi-
bility from the name of the hill opposite to it, which is called
Curor na Croike, The hill of the gibbet*.

   Character.-The people, for the most part, are regular and
orderly, and behave inoffensively, and many of them in an ex-
emplary manner+.  It cannot indeed be said, that they are in-
dustrious, nor do they enjoy what would much prompt them
thereto, as there are no manufactures carried on here.  But
what they want in point of industry, they make up by fru-
gality.  In some places, whisky drinking is rather too com-
mon, which is not easily avoided; as they are often employ-
ed in buying and selling cattle, and making other bargains, in
the neighbourhood of several distilleries.  Only one person
has suffered for a capital crime within there 20 years; viz.
for theft and house-breaking.

*The names of places are almost all derived from the Gaelic.  Some of them
have references to combats betwixt the clans, as Tudamtarbback, plentiful, fall;
Darecha, the end of the battle, etc.
+The common people all speak Gaelic; but many can speak and understand
English.
