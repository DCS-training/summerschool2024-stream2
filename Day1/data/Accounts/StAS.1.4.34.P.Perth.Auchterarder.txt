     Statistical Account

on the E. by Dunning, and on the S. by Glendovan and 
Fossaway.  The greatest part of the parish is a flat and 
level country, lying on the south of the river Earn; it al-
so includes in it some part of the Ochil hills, particularly
Craigrossie, one of the highest of them.  These hills are 
all green, and good sheep-pasture.  Almost the whole of
the low part of the parish is arable, and a good, though
not a strong soil; on the banks of the Earn it inclines to
a loam, but in general it is dry and light, requiring such a 
stimulus as lime or marl, and rewarding well whatever ex-
pence is laid out in that way.  It may be farther observed, 
that the northern declivity of the hills is arable a conside-
rable way upwards, and there is the strongest reason to be-
lieve that in former ages the hills have been plowed in
many places to the very summit; the ridges are still plain
and distinct.

   Air.-The air is dry and good in summer, but rather
moist and damp in winter, as is the case in the greatest
part of Strathern, particularly in the neighbourhood of the 
Ochils.  In the winter months the sun has not influence
sufficient to dissipate the vapours which are attracted by
the hills, and the most frequent winds blowing from them,
must necessarily occasion a moisture in the air.  This, one
should think, would give rise to rheumatisms, and similar
disorders, as it does in some instances; yet it cannot be
said that rheumatism is prevalent distemper here; and it is
remarkable that of late years scarcely an instance of a per-
son afflicted with the ague has occured; the disorder
which has been most prevalent and fatal for some years
past, is a fever of the nervous kind.

   Rivers.-The Earn, which bounds the parish on the  N-
produces salmon, and the large white and yellow trout;
