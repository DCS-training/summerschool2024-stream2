The agent at Portnockie has furnished me with the fol-
lowing note:

<TABLE>

To 7913 lobsters received at Portnockie, for the Northum-
  berland Fishery Society, at 2 1/2 d. -                    L. 82   8   6 1/2
To cash paid for cork, cords, twine, crill bot-
  toms, iron rims, and other necessary ex-
  penses for behoof of the Society,    -                      125   1   1 1/2
Now, allowing the other 3 towns in this pa-
 rish to have had similar activity and suc-
 cess in this fishery in 1792, the total product 
 is,                                                          365   9   6
And the total cash paid out by the Company's 
 agents for cork, etc.                                        554   1   5
To the above let us add an average state of
 the 31 boats, exclusive of the herring fishery,
 reckoning every man's annual income from
 the great and small fish at L. 20, and the
 boys at L. 10, and every boat to have 6
 men and a boy, the total product is                      L. 4030   0   0

   N. B. The average product of the herring fishery is not
stated, as it was begun only 5 years ago, and all the fishers
do not engage in it.

   I have only farther to observe on the subject of the
fisheries, that a few salmon are caught in the parish at the
mouths of the rivulets or burns of Gollachie and Tynet.
They are commonly called stall fisheries.  Of these there are 
2 at Tynet, belonging to Mr Baron Gordon and Mr Dunbar.
The 4 might produce about L. 24 annually to the pro-
prietors.

and are kept in repair by the stature-labour.  The post-
