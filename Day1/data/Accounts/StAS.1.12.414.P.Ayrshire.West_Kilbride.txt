Linlithgow measure, and 420 L. Scots; in value, when vic-
tual is at a high price, about 126 L. Sterling.  The Earl of
Eglintoune is patron, and titular of the tiends.  The manse
is but an indifferent one; and thought it has received repairs
at different times, it is very little mended, but still remains
a smoky inconvenient house.  It is subjected to a grievance, or,
rather a curse which attends most manses, that it stands hard
by the village, and part of it projects into the church-yard.
The church is built upon a very bad construction.  It is a
long, narrow, mean looking edifice; low in the walls, and
deep roofed.  There are few dissenters from the Established
Church, in proportion to the number of parishioners; there
being only about 50 belonging to the 2 common feets of Se-
ceders and Relief, who repair to their several meetings in the
neighbouring congregations.-As a proof of the industry, and
comfortable situation of the inhabitants, in general, the num-
ber of poor is small, there being only 7, at present, upon the
pension list of the parish:  And, what is much to its cre-
dit, there are no wandering beggars belonging to it.  There
is not an instance in the recollection of any one living, of a
single pauper strolling without the limits of the place.  The
fund for the maintenance of the poor, is made up mostly from
the collections at the church-doors.  Of late, it hath received
aid from the liberal donations of some generous individuals,
to whose bounty, a statistical history, ought to pay the just
tribute of encomium.

   Antiquities, Remarkable Occurrences, etc.-This article
would afford abundant matter for the antiquary and inquisi-
tive naturalist; but we must abridge as much as possible.  We
begin with the island of Little Cumbray.  This island is a-
bout a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth.  It lies in 
the parallel direction to Bute, from S. W. to N. E.  The
