sists of moss and moor, and here and there corn-fields, gained
from these, with farm-towns at a considerable distance from
one another; on the W. border of the parish, and along its
whole breadth, are continued mosses and moors.

   Sea-Coast, Caves, Castle, Cairns, Etc.-The sea-coast in this
district consists of high rocks; those to the W. of the church re-
markably so, and in the whole length of the parish there are
only 3 openings, where boats can land, one near the borders of
Pitsligo, one immediately below the church, and one at the
N. W. corner of the parish, where the burns of Troup and
Auchmedden discharge themselves into the sea, and where,
about 50 years ago, was a small neat and convenient harbour,
where ships from the neighbouring sea-ports used to winter,
as well as to land, but which being neglected, is now totally
destroyed, not a vestige of the piers remaining, but the stones
of which they were built, and which have so entirely filled
up the former bason, that it is with difficulty that the fishing
boats, 3 in number, with 6 hands each, can land.  Here is a
fishing-town, consisting of 110 inhabitants, in general very so-
ber, industrious, well behaved people.  Along the sea-coast are
many caves, entering from the sea.  The most remarkable
one is at the N. E. corner of the parish, near the borders of
Pitsligo parish, called Cows-haven, which runs up through
the country, no body knows how far, though several people
have proceeded as far as the air, which is foul (the entrance
of the cave being mostly choked with the sand and pebbles
thrown up by the sea), would allow them to do with safety*.

*There are two others in the bay of Aberdour, near the church, through
which the tide flows.  The eastmost of those is quite dry at low water, co-
vered with a fine sand, and affords a pleasant retreat in a warm summer's day,
as,well as an agreeable passage to the rocks on the other side.  It is 90 feet long,
