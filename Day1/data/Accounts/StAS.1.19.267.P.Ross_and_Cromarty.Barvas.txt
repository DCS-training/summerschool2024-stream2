     of Barvas.

The horses and cows are of a very small size, partly owing
to the pasture, but more so to the little attention paid to
the proper selection of bulls and stallions, by which they
are yearly decreasing, and must continue so to do till this
evil be remedied.
   All the sheep, except a few of the black-faced kind in-
troduced by the minister, are remarkably small.  They
roam at large through the moor, without any herdsman to
attend them.  Though very wild, they are in general, how-
ever, so far tame, that they can be driven into small inclo-
sures, where the wool is pulled off, a barbarous custom,
which certainly must be detrimental to the animal and its
wool, and indeed proves fatal, when the weather happens
to be severe immediately after this plucking.-The horses,
though small, are remarkably hardy and mettled.-The beef
and mutton sweet and well flavoured.-Horses, upon an
average, fell at L. 2, 10 s.; cows and stots at L. 2, 5 s. and
sheep at 3 s. each.

   Population.-It is impossible to say what number of souls
might have been in the parish, as there never were any regi-
sters kept.  Population, however, is allowed to be on the in-
crease, chiefly owing to the farms being much smaller than
in former times.  There are in the parish, 439 families,
2006 souls, 914 males, 1092 females: Souls under 6 years
old, 334; ditto betwixt 6 and 14 years, 407; ditto betwixt
14 and 60 years, 1067; and above 60, 198.  In 1755, the
population, by Dr Webster's list, was 1995.  There are 14
weavers, 5 tailors, 7 blacksmiths, 340 fishers, and 1 miller.
There is not one man by profession a shoemaker; the most
of the inhabitants supply themselves with shoes or brogues;
nor, indeed, do any of the above tradesmen depend wholly
upon their occupations, all of them having small farms.
