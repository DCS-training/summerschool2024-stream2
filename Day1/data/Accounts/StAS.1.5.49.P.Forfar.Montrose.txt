houses, if not elegant, are, on the whole, well built and
regular; but, like those of Flanders, their gabel ends are
often turned towards the street.  With one or two excep-
tions, they are now all of stone, and many of them covered
with blue slates.  In the principal part of the town, each
family possesses a separate house.  But beyond the port,
and at the shore, the cafe is otherwise.  Hence it is more
populous, than a stranger would be apt to imagine.  As it
is a town more distinguished by the residence of persons of
opulence and fashion, than of commerce and industry, and
often, but especially in time of war, full of soldiers and
sailors, the vices, which predominate in these dissipated
times, are not uncommon.  But, on the whole, the charac-
ter of the people is respectable, possessing a degree of pu-
blic spirit, of hospitality to strangers, and of charity to the
poor, rarely to be equalled.
