of Cornwall, at the other end of the island, find so produc-

most barren moors*.

     CONCLUSION.

     SECT. I. Peculiar Advantages of Thurso in its present
State.-In its present state, Thurso is well situated for trade,
manufactures, and fisheries.  It has ready access to the na-
vigation of the Atlantic and German Oceans, and its pro-
ductions are well calculated for the trade of both.  Situated
in a country where provisions are cheap, manufactures of
various kinds might be carried on to advantage; and in few
places on the coast of Scotland, cau fisheries be prosecuted,
with greater certainty of success, thanon the coast of Caith-
ness.  In short, nothing seems wanting except an increase
of capital, and the example of a few enterprising merchants
and manufacturers, to make Thurso a flourishing and an
opulent place.  Without those aids, it is already advancing
rapidly towards improvement, merely through the indu-
stry and exertions of a few individual, of moderate capi-
tals.

   SECT. II. Improvements suggested.-The harbour may
be improved at a small expence; and apier at Scrabster
could be erected for less than L. 2000, which would be of
great public utility.  The depth of water, the vicinity of
excellent stone for the purpose, are advantages which that
place possesses in a peculiar degree.

   It is peculiarly well calculated, for a station to the British
Fishing Society, if a plan for that purpose could be arranged
among the parties interested.
