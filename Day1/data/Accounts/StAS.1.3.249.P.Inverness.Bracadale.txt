computed miles, and situated at one extremity of this parish.
There are several of the same form in different parts of this
country, and are all built upon eminences or rising grounds.
There is, at the distance of about a computed mile from the
manse, a subterraneous cavern or grotto, artificially built
with stone within, and the top laid over with earth, so that
it cannot be seen till a person is close at the entry, which is
narrow and difficult of access.  It is believed, that all these
subterraneous caverns were used as places of shelter or con-
cealment in perilous times.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are no turnpike roads
nor bridges in the parish.  There have been some attempts
to make a general road through the parish, partly by statute
labour, and partly by raising money; but the roads are still
for the most part, in a wretched state.  With regard to in-
closures, there are in general no stone inclosures; there are 
some seal dykes, which get an annual reparation.  There are 
some other kinds of ditches, or seal dykes of a more durable
form.
