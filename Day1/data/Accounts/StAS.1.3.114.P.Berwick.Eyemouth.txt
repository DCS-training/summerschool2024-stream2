except the northerly and north easterly.  From this circum-
stance, its situation seems very advantageous:  But, as the
mouth of the river or harbour lies open to the northerly
winds, ships cannot lie in safety therein, without going up
beyond the elbow of the present quay, where the water being
shallower by several feet, and the breadth much contracted,
the harbour is not only defective in point of capacity, but in
safety also; for, at a full sea, (the mouth being wide), the
sea tumbles in with so much impetuosity, that great seas find
their way round the elbow, and make the vessels, even there,
lie not so quiet as is to be withed.  In order, therefore, not
only to enlarge the harbour, but very greatly to increase
the safety of vessels lying therein, it is proposed to build a
north pier to defend the harbour's mouth; and, to this end,
nature has furnished a ledge of rocks, not only capable of
making the most excellent of all foundations for such a pier,
but in as advantageous a direction as could be wished; upon
which a pier is proposed to be built according to the plans
accompanying this Report:  For, according to the direction
therein specified, the harbour will be defended from all such
seas as annoy the bay; and the only points from whence the
harbour could be affected by seas coming in through the
mouth, is land locked by the points of the bay; so that the
harbour will, in its whole extent, be perfectly safe in all winds.
It is also to be noted, that the same circumstances which con-
cur to make the harbour safe in all winds, afford the means
of vessels getting in and out in all winds; and this proceeds
from the entry into the harbour lying nearly at a right angle
with the direction into and out of the bay.  It also is a great
advantage that there is a good flow of tide, which at spring
tides is said to be twenty feet; and there is at the lowest ebb
several feet of water, at low water, between the proposed
pier heads; so that there will be seldom less at ship tides than
