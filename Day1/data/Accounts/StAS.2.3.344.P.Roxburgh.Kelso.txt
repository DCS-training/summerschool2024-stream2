     blished for the advocacy of political reform in 1832: the "Mail,"
     a Conservative journal, has existed since 1797, having been pro-
     jected and, for a time, conducted by the late Mr James Ballantyne,
     who commenced in Kelso his career as a printer. Various news-
     papers and other periodical works have issued from the Kelso press
     since 1783, when "the Kelso Chronicle," the first newspaper in
     the south of Scotland, was commenced; but, with the exception of
     that journal, which lasted for eighteen years, and another newspa-
     per, the "Kelso Weekly Journal," which existed from 1808 to 1829,
     none of them have been successful.  It is creditable, however, to
     the literary enterprise of the place, that so many attempts have
     been made: and it will ever serve to connect the name of Kelso
     with literature, that its press produced the first edition of "The
     Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border."
          Charitable and Economic Institutions--Dispensary.--The oldest
     of our charitable institutions is the Kelso Dispensary, which was
     established in 1777, for the benefit of the sick poor of the town
     and district, principally through the philanthropic exertions of the
     late, Hon. Mrs Baillie of Mollerstain and the late Dr C. Douglas of
     Kelso. This institution is supported by voluntary contributions;
     its accwmulated capital, however, being now at length so consider-
     able as to make it independent of any very large amount of an-
     nual subscriptions.  Patients are, under certain limitations, visited
     at their own houses, by the surgeons of the institution; and, in
     the institution-house, there are both wards for fever patients, and
     rooms for the performance of surgical operations; to which have
     recently been added water and vapour baths, accessible, at a spe-
     cified charge, to the public generally.  The following table (which,
     with the valuable explanatory remarks and notes appended to it,            -
     has been obligingly furnished by the respected physician to the
     Dispensary,) exhibits the number of patients, and of the principal
     diseases, registered during the first five and the ]art five vears of
     the institution.
