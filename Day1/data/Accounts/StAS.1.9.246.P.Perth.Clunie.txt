ry where warped through the crooked ridges of his neigh-
bour; and the country being open in winter as well as in
summer, all things were common, and men and beasts were
at liberty to prey upon one another.  Happily for the
place, the pleasure, and the advantage of the people, the
scene has now assumed another and a better appearance.
Commonties and runrigs are done away; the farms begin
to be reduced to some form, and the marches to be streight-
ed.  Each man begins to know his own, and to have it in
his power to improve it.  Wet grounds are drained; rough
grounds are cleared; stone-fences are built, and hedges are
planted.  Marl is brought from the neighbouring parishes of
Kinloch and Caputh; lime from the shore of Perth; rich

(during which time there has been a considerable revolu-

and in some places tripled, and, which was not the case be-

independent of their landlords on that account; and though
in every respect the expense of living has more than kept
pace with the rise of the rents, it is a fact, that both them-
selves and their families are better lodged, better dressed,
and better fed than ever.  These remarks are applicable to
the tenants in general, and they are particularly applicable
to a few, leading, active, and sensible men, who are happi-
