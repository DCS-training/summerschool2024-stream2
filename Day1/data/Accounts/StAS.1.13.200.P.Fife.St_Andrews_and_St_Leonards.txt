Sea-weeds.-The sea-rocks in this parish are covered with 
the common weed, which used formerly to be cut every 
third year, and burn for kelp.  The demand for this ar-
ticle seems to be diminished; as fo several years past, the 
corporation of St Andrew's have not been able to get their 
sea-weed let to any undertaker.  This weed the farmers 
never cut for manure; and the tangle, though its broad 
leaved tops are seen in great quantities on the surface of 
the sea, yet is so situated at the farther extremity of the 
rocks, and grows in so deep water, that they can neither 
cut nor tear it up.  Every gale of wind, however, from a-
ny easterly point, and every violent agitation of the sea, 
throws upon the beach and into every creek, all the way 
from the mouth of Eden to the east end of the parish, a 
great quantity of tangle mixed with many other weeds, 
which are carefully gathered; and, according to the season 
of the year, are spread on the grass, mixed in dunghills, or 
tilled down for barley or potatoes.  The Corporation of 
St Andrew's have hitherto permitted the towns people in 
common to gather, tax free, whatever sea-weed is thrown 
in between the mouth of Eden and the east sands adjoining 
to the harbour; the remainder of the shore is private pro- 
perty of the several heritors, according to the extent of 
their respective lands.

the widows and on the children, until they should be capable of doing 
for themselves.  And so faithfully and prudently has this fund been mana- 
ged, that though the widows have regularly received such a pension as, 
with their own labour, has been sufficient for their support, though the 
children have been helped forward in life, though different sums have been 
applied for repairing the fishermens losses at sea, and though the grand- 
children of some of the sufferers have also been occasionally relieved, yet 
there remains of the stock about L. 60 Sterling, and the number of pen- 
sioners, by death and otherwise, reduced to four.
