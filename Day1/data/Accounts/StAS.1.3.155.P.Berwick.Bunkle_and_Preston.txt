county in general.  They are the English breed introduced
by Mr Bakewell, and since carried on by the Messrs Culleys,
and other eminent breeders, both in Northumberland, and 
this county.  The criterion of their goodness and sort, is
getting sooner and more easily fat, than any other animal,
bearing a valuable fleece, and enriching the land upon which
they are fed.  There are two different ages at which they
are sold; the first when they are about 18 months old, after
the first fleece is taken off, when they are called dunmotts, at
which time they usually sell from 24 s. to 34 s.  The second 
time is after their second fleece is taken off, when they are
called wedders of the first head, and are 28 months old, when
they sell from 32 s. to 38 s. each.  The fleece weighs from
seven to eight pounds each, and sells from 4 s. 6 d. to 5 s.
The ewes are kept for breeders, and are fold, after having
three lambs, from 24 s. to 34 s.  These sheep are bought by
dealers, and driven to Morpeth market, where they are again
fold, and killed at Newcastle, Shields, and Sunderland, for
the use of the coallieries and shipping; and many are driven
to Yorkshire, and farther south.  The wool is sold to agents
from Leeds, and other manufacturing towns in Yorkshire;
some is shipped at Berwick for Aberdeenshire, and a small
quantity sent to Edinburgh and Stirling.  The best pas-
tures are appropriated for feeding sheep in summer, and
they are mostly fed for five months in winter, upon turnip,
of which very large quantities are raised.  An acre of good
pasture, value of guinea, will fatten three; and the average
expence of turnip is 3 d. per week, each sheep, when fed to 
the highest extent, which for the winter five months is 5 s.
each.  It is computed that two ewes rear three lambs.  High
prices are paid for the hire of rams of good breeds, viz.
from 10 to 30 guineas is common per season.  Some have
paid double or more for the season of the best bred rams.
