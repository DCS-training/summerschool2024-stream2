		  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The inhabitants of Bothkennar are distinguished for their sober
and industrious habits, and live in the most friendly terms with
each other. They are most attentive to the public ordinances of
the Gospel; and their moral conduct has been such, that there is
not an instance upon record of any individual having been arraign-
ed or punished for any offence against the laws of his country.
Since the opening of the colliery in this district, a large propor-
tion of the parish, as already stated, are employed in that establish-
ment, whose habits and manners, it is much to be regretted, are
not such as become the Gospel. Their wages are high, and the
greater part is spent on the Saturday and Sabbath in public-
houses, which contributes exceedingly to make them inattentive
to the ordinances of religion. Very few of them at any time en-
ter the house of God.
