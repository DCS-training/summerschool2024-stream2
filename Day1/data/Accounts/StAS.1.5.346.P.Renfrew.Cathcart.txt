of the surface, or dip, as it is called, being one ell in five;
so that from the increasing labour, and expence of putting
out the stone, they must soon be obliged to desist.  But, it
is said, there is no scarcity of lime in other parts of the
parish, which may be wrought more easily.  Coal is also
found in all the different parts of the parish from N. to S.
The coal under the lands of Corsehill, forms a part of the
great Govan coal-work, which furnishes a considerable part
of the fuel consumed in Glasgow, and that populous neigh-
bourhood; besides exporting large quantities, by the river
Clyde, to remote countries.  This work, however, is at
present carried on within the parish of Govan.  In the
southern part of the parish, the coal is also wrought, but
upon a small scale, and what is put out, is chiefly used for
the smithy, or for burning lime.  It would appear, that
hitherto, it has only been the crop coal, which has been
wrought in these places.  There is little reason to doubt,
but upon sinking deeper, other seams of coal, of greater
thickness and value, might be found.  But these will re-
main as magazines, to supply the demand of the manufac-
turing city of Glasgow, when the other coals, more contiguous,
are exhausted.-It has also been affirmed, that iron-stone is
to be found in the parish; although, from the great quan-
tity of this substance to be met with every where, there is
little reason to expect that it will soon turn out to any ac-
count.-The curious and inquisitive have found many un-
common minerals and fossils, in the channel of the Cart, with
which they have amused themselves.  There is a  stream
which falls into it, a little way above the bridge, which, it
would appear, has the power of petrefying vegetable substan-
ces: Pieces of wood and moss, completely converted into stone,
have been picked up, bearing all the marks of their former
texture and organization.  Spars and chrystallizations,
