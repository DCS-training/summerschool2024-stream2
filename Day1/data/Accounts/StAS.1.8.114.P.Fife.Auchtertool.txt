   Evils like these, may not indeed be very sensibly perceived
or felt, for a considerable time:  But, though their operation
may be flow, yet it will not, on that account, be the less cer-
rain; nor the less to be dreaded in its tendency and conse-
quences, as an accelerator of national weakness and decline.
But in our ardour to extend our manufactures and our com-
merce, and thereby to multiply the delicacies and luxuries of
life, as well as to increase our taste and desire for the use of
them, we perhaps but too readily forget, that human nature
is but too liable to temptation and corruption, and that infirmity
of body, and depravity of mind, are, sooner or later, the al-
most certain consequences of every great assemblage of our
species.  We perhaps but too readily forget, that the prospe-
rity, the stability, and the glory of nations, do not consist so
much in the wealth,-no, nor even in the numbers, of their
inhabitants-as in their political, their military, and their
personal character and virtues;-as in the penetration and the
depth of mind, which they are able to display, in discovering
where their true interests lie; in the promptitude and the
ardour, with which they are, at all times, prepared to guard
and to defend their rights; and in the practice of those private
and public virtues, which are alike conducive to the welfare
and stability of kingdoms, and the perfection and aggrandise-
ment of the species.
   The present state of the population, and the division of
the inhabitants, in this district, is pretty nearly as follows:
