     Statistical Account

most delightful short rides in this country will be from Edin-
burgh to Dalkeith by Inveresk, up the North Esk to the
head of this parish, across the Pentland Hills by Bavelaw,
and down the Water of Leith; or, for an excursion of some
days, from Pennycuick to Lanark by Carnwath, down the
Clyde by the new tract to Glasgow, from thence to Stirling
by Loch Lomond, and down by the Forth and Hopeton
House back to Edinburgh.
   The people are of various sizes.  They are like those of other
parishes, many of them good, and some of them bad.  A
murmuring discontented spirit, and disposition to censure
public measures, both in church and state, too often appears.
Formerly, when a person desired a neighbour to do any little
favour for him, it was usual to promise him a pint of ale, but
now it is, 'I will give a half mutchkin,' meaning whisky, a
potion destructive to morals and health; for when they en-
gage they often proceed to a much greater length.
   Within these twenty years past there has been a very great
alteration both in their dress and food.  The young peo-
ple especially are very expensive as to articles of clothes.
There is now more flesh meat eat here in one week than was
formerly in six months; and tea, that very expensive article,
is frequently drunk even amongst the lowest of the people.
