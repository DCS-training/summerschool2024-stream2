   In the banks of the river above Calderhall, the water which
exudes from the rocks contains lime in solution, and deposits it
in profusion on the mossy covering of the stones, when it comes
in contact with the atmosphere.
   From the account now given of the geology of the parish, it
will be seen that it is well supplied with building materials, having
freestone, lime, and sand, in abundance, and all of good quality.
   Botany.-The boundaries of this parish are peculiarly incon-
venient to the botanist, who, being limited thereby, purposes to
convey to a stranger an adequate idea of the Flora of this district
of the county; for, although the Dalmahoy and Kairnes Hills,
Ravelrig Toll Moss, the Pentland Hills, the north bank of the
Almond, and Calder Wood, all well-known habitats for many of
the rarer plants of Mid-Lothian, lie closely and temptingly adja-
cent, vet, being beyond its limits, it would be inconsistent with
the plan of a work like the present, to include their productions
in a notice of plants purporting to have been actually found
within the parish; and, indeed, it may be thought that the printed
results of the labours of Dr Greville, Mr Woodforde, the inde-
fatigable Mr Watson, and of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh,
have rendered any further enumeration of plants-growing within
ten or twelve miles of the Scottish capital a work of supereroga-
tion. And, truly, it would be altogether so, were it not that, ever
since the publication of the more recent of the lists of plants above
alluded to, alterations have occurred, and these, instead of in-
creasing, have diminished the catalogue of our rarer plants; for,
besides those gradual botanical changes which from time to time
result from the planting or removal of trees, and the extension
of draining and of cultivation, the popularity of the study of bo-
tany has of late years materially co-operated in extirpating, if not
totally, at least from known habitats, several of our rarest species;
and the unsparing zeal with which "foraging excursions" of her-
bivorous botanical students carry on their collecting operations,
is annually making our plants go through the comparative degrees
of rarity, till the local botanist is with grief obliged to remove
their names altogether from his list. For examples, the Osmunda
regalis is now no longer to be founds on the south banks of the
Linhouse Water; the Gymnadenia emopsea has become ex-
tremely scarce; and the white-flowered variety of that elegant
and most fragrant of our native Orchidea and which at all times
was rare, has totally disappeared. The Glaucium luteum, once
common on tile gravelly banks of the Water of Leith, about eleven
