     NUMBER III.

     PARISH OF LOCHWINNOCH,

     (COUNTY OF RENFREW, PRESBYTERY OF PAISLEY, SYNOD
     OF GLASGOW AND AYR.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES STEVEN, Minister.

     Name, Extent, Soil and Surface, etc.

   LOCHWINNOCH seems to be derived from the large loch or
lake, which is nearly in the center of the parish, and St.
Winnoch, or Winnioch, under whose protection it was suppo-
sed to have been placed in the dark ages, and whose name
still remains, although his history is buried in oblivion.  This
parish extends to about 6 miles square.  The soil is extreme-
ly various.  The higher grounds, exclusive of muir, con-
sist of a light dry soil on whin-stone, or rotten rock, and pro-
duce a great quantity of very rich grass and natural white
clover.  The lower grounds consist of clay and loam, and
produce good crops of every kind.
