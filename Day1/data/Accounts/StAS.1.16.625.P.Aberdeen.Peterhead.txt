terhead; lately 3-4ths of an acre were purchased for L. 90,
and in two years afterwards were sold for L. 200 Sterling.
A site for a house, consisting only of five falls and five ells,
sold for L. 37 Sterling a few months ago; that is, nearly at
the rate of L. 1150 per acre.  About 20 years ago, the
Governors asked L. 150 for one acre; a gentleman only
offered L. 145; on this acre houses to a great value are now
erected; but were there no houses, it would probably fetch
eight times the money that was formerly asked for it.  An-
other acre, about 30 years ago, was purchased for L. 120,
one fourth part of which would at present fetch from L. 400
to L. 500 Sterling.  There are some particular situations,
where L. 100 would be obtained for a site for a house, with
very little back ground.
   Within these few years more houses have been built
than at any former period in the same space of time; lately
four new streets were opened, on which a number of houses
are already built, and feus daily giving off.  Within these
last two years, in the course of 12 months, I am informed
L. 4000 Sterling have been expended on building houses.

   Character.-The inhabitants are in general very atten-
tive, very industrious, sober, discreet, and humane.  They
are very regular in their attendance on public worship, and
these good qualities may in general be applied to the whole
of the parish.

   Style of Living.-The style of living is much changed of
late; but the inhabitants, for the most part, are economi-
cal, and live within their income.  Luxuries of life are now
more frequent than formerly, both in dress and entertain-
ments; but, on the whole, there is less of dissipation, extra-
vagance, and drunkenness, than in any town of the same size
and opulence with which I am acquainted.
