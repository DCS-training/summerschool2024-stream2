the barley; some take wheat after drilled beans or po-
tatoes, and then barley and oats; after turnips they sow
barley, and then oats with grass-feeds.  The parish in ge-
neral exports wheat and barley, and imports oats and meal.
The prices are much the same as in Mid Lothian, or some-
thing lower.  Farms are from 50 to 150 acres.  There
are about 200 acres planted in the parish.  The trees
thrive well, and much more may be done this way.  The
rugged spots, which are frequent, and generally covered
with furze, if they were planted, would beautify the face
of the country which they now deform.

   Roads and Minerals.-The roads in this parish are gene-
rally bad, as in other parts of Fife.  The gentlemen of
the county are now paying attention to the direction and
the formation of the roads.  Toll-bars are erecting, and a
great change for the better must soon take place.  The
village of Aberdour, like many others, has suffered by its
causeway being changed into a common road.  Such a
road in a narrow village continues long moist, and is hurt-
ful to the health of the inhabitants.  They suffer great in-
conveniences too, in winter, from the depth of the road,
and in summer, from the dust.  Neither does a common
road last in a village, being exhausted by the attempts which
are made to keep it clean.  A paved causeway endures,
and no inconvenience which the travellers can find from
it, can balance the daily inconveniencies to which the resi-
denters are subjected by the other.  The parish abounds with
coal, lime and free stone, and some iron stone.  The coal
is not wrought at present.  The inhabitants are supplied
with this necessary article from collieries in the neighbour-
ing parishes.  The price paid on the hills is 6 d.  the load,
of 18 stone, of chews or small coal; the great coal is refer-
red at present for the sea-sale.  The limestone of the coast
