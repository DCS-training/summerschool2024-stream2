here referred.  There are 12 orchards in this parish, the
largest of which is about 3 acres in extent.  They produce
chiefly apples and pears, and, in good fruit seasons, bring the
proprietors a plentiful return.

   Population, etc.-According to a list of the inhabitants,
taken by the present minister in 1783, the number of souls
was then about 730; but since that time it has considerably
decreased, owing, among other causes, to the shipping hav-
ing been, in a great measure, removed from Carron shore to
Grangemouth, on which account, several houses in this pa-
rish have been taken down, and others are left without in-
habitant.  In the year 1793, another list was taken, from
which it appears, that there are now only 144 families, and
in all about 600 inhabitants, of whom 303 are males, and
297 females; 164 married, and 436 unmarried; among
which last, 45 are widowers and widows, and 133 children
below 10 years of age.  The number of marriages, baptism,
and burials, for the last 10 years, according to the parish
register, which, during that time, has been very regularly
kept, is as follows:
