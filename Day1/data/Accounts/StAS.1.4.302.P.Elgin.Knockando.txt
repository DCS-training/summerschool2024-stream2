     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.

   KNOCKANDOW has its name from two Celtic words,
Knock, signifying 'hill,' and Dow, 'black'.  It is si-
tuated in the county of Moray, presbytery of Aberdour
and Synod of Moray, about 10 miles in length, and, at an
average, 2 in breadth.  It is bounded on the S. and S. W.
by the parishes of Inveraven and Aberdour, from which it
is separated by the river Spey, one of the most rapid in
Scotland; on the E. by Rothes, on the N. by Birnie and
Dallas, on the W. by Edinkilly and Cromdale.-The
country is hilly; the soil either deep moss or sandy gravel;
the air dry and healthy.-Spey is the only river connect-
ed with the parish, which produces salmon; but owing to
cruives, few of them get up this length.  The hills are co-
vered with heath, and the river-side with birch, oak and
alder.  The many small rivulets that descend from the
hills, are frequently in the months of February and No-

considerable harm.  This happened particularly in 1783,
