     of Montrose.

antiquity belonging to Montrose is an hospital, or maison de
Dieu, which has been allowed to go to ruin; but the reve-
nues are preserved, and are under the management of the
Town-council, and a master of the hospital of their ap-
pointment.  One of the most ancient houses in the town,
(now belonging to, and possessed by Mr Scott of Logie),
is famous for being the house, where the celebrated Mar-
quis of Montrose was born; and in which the pretender
slept on 13th February 1716, the night before his 
escape.  Next morning he went on board a frigate, which
lay in the road, and conveyed him safe to France.

   Population.-The following statements will pretty clearly
prove a progressive increase of population.

   The lists of marriages and burials may be depended
on.  The list of baptisms is as exact as could be pro-
cured.  But the inattention of parents, and the backward-
ness of many to pay the schoomaster his dues, is a matter
of very general complaint throughout Scotland, and contri-
butes to render such lists less accurate, than might be wish-
ed.  If we multiply 127, which was the number of bu-
rials from 1st January 1685, to ditto 1686, by 36, the
parish, at that time, would contain about 4572 inhabitants.
According to this method of computation, the number of
souls, from 1740 to 1750, were, at an average, only 4248
but, from 1780 to 1790, they increased considerably.
   The following lists were extracted from the minister's
parish rolls, which are made up with all possible accuracy:
