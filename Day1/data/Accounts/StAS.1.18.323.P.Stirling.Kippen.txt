body of stagnant water, swelled from time to time by rains,
and melted snow, and rivulets descending from the heights,
would continue to increase till it became so considerable as to
open a passage for itself to the east.  And thus the valley, at
that period, must have exhibited the appearance of a vast mo-
rass.  The wood and leaves, and other vegetable substances,
all rotting together, would in time accumulate, and form the
great body of the moss.  The consolidation of this mass of
corrupted vegetables would leave room for the water above
it, to run off by such channels as it could find or form.  By
such a process in a series of ages, it is natural to imagine, that
this moss has been brought into the state in which it now
appears.

   Casting of Peats.-The soil underneath the moss is a strong
rich clay.  The moss is generally from 8 to 10 feet in depth,
and consists of different substances, regularly disposed in strata,
as follows.  Immediately above the clay is a stratum of fat
brown earth, from 9 to 12 inches in depth, supposed to have
been formed by the incorporation of the clay with the conti-
guous moss, and which seems to have been the vegetable mold,
covering the clay when the forest was cut down.  The next
bed lying immediately above the former, is the great body of
the moss, which consists of various vegetable substances, cor-
rupted, compacted, and matured by age.  This is annually
cut for peats, and supplies most families in this country with
fuel through the year.  The upper stratum is a light and spon-
gy substance, much paler in the colour than the bed of peat
moss.  It seems to be formed chiefly of decayed leaves and
stalks of heath, bent grass, and other plants with which the
surface of the moss is overgrown, but not yet sufficiently cor-
rupted so as to be formed into moss.  Of this upper stratum,
3 or 4 feet must always be pared away, which is generally done
