   Antiquities.-On the height, to the west of the manse, there
were two tumuli of earth, covered over with stones.
When the tenant cleared off the stones, and digged to level
his field, he found several urns of potter's clay figured, in
which were ashes and pieces of bones.  There is likewise, a
little farther to the north west, a pretty large tumulus, where-
in there were also found several urns of the same kind, with
ashes and bones in them.

   Poor.-None are allowed to beg in the parish.  The poor's
funds, together with the weekly collections, are sufficient to
supply them.
