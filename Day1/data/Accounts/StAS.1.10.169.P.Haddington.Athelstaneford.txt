   Climate, etc.-From the elevated situation of the village,
and the open state of the parish in general, the inhabitants
are very healthy.  No epidemical distempers of any kind, ex-
cepting the common diseases incident to children, are known;
and deaths are chiefly confined to infancy and old age.
Many instances of longevity have occurred.  One man died
about a year ago at the age of 90, and several above 80.
There are, at present, in the parish, 10 persons above 80,
all of them healthy and active.  The practice of inoculation
is become general among persons of better station; and it is
attended with the happiest effects, not one child having ever
died under that management.  The common people still re-

dren in the village who took the small-pox in the natural
way, no fewer than 5 died; while all who were inoculated had
them in the most favourable way, and recovered immediately.
A fact of this kind, so well known, and with which the lives
of children are so essentially connected, one would imagine,
must overcome the most obstinate prejudices.  It may be pro-
per to observe, that besides people in the other lines of life
that are settled in the village, there is a baker and a brewer.
But, among the other advantages which this village and pa-
rish enjoys, there is one that deserves particular notice.  One
of the best butcher markets in Scotland is established here.
it was originally set up under the patronage of the late Sir
Francis Kinloch of Gilmerton, and has been carried on with
success for more than 60 years by the same man, who, during
that long period, has been universally respected for his inte-
grity and frankness in dealing.  He was among the first
