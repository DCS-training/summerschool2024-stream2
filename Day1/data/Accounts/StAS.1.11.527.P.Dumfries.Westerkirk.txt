The sulphurated antimony is fold at 42 L., the regulus of
antimony at 8 cl. per ton.

   Miners, Village, etc.-There are 40 people, exclusive of an
overseer, employed at present in the mines, and in preparing
the antimony.  A miner's wages are from 23 L. to 26 L. a year,
and, as such, he enjoys many other advantages.  The com-
pany has built a village, which is pleasantly situated on the
banks of the Megget, and named Fames' Town, in which
every miner is provided with a comfortable lodging for him-
self and his family, at a moderate rent: He has grass for a
cow, during the summer, for which he pays no more than 20 s.,
and 1 cs. for coarse hay for her provision in the winter; and
may have as much land as he has occasion for, at the rate of
1 cs. per acre, for cultivating cabbages and potatoes.  A store-
house is built by the company, in which they mean to lay up
grain when the prices are low, and fell it out to the workmen,
at all times, even in a season of dearth and scarcity, at the
rate at which it was purchased.  The miners are at work
only 6 hours a-day; and, to encourage them to read, a pre-
sent was, some months ago, made them in books, by the com-
pany, to the value of 15 L.; and these, with others, which the
workmen have since been able to purchase, amount at present
to 120 volumes.  To render the situation of the miners as
comfortable as possible, the company has built a school-house,
for the purpose of having their children educated; has grant-
ed considerable advantages to the teacher, and purposes to
give 1 cl. per annum, to which each of the workmen is to add
18 a quarter, as a fund for the relief of such individuals
among them, as may be disqualified for following their em-
ployment by sickness and old age.  We wish success to this
undertaking.  The mining company not only finds employ-
ment to many individuals, but has done an essential service to
