   Lime has conduced very much to the improvement of
Urquhart.  There is abundance  of limestone on Sir James
Grant's estate, and to encourage its use, he not only gives
his people quarry-leave free, but is at the expence of quar-
rying the stones for them.  He also gives manufactured
lime for new ground, as a premium to the industrious te-
nant and cottar, at the rate of from 60 to 80 bolls an acre.
Lime is much used as a manure by all improvers in farm-
ing, but it is to be regretted, that fuel is rather scarce,
which enhances the price of lime, it being so high as 2 s. 6 d.
and 3 s. the boll of shells, and that boll only making from 2 1/2
to 3 bolls.  The boll measures 96 Scotch pints.
   Something more than 20 years ago, Sir James Grant
built a small house, in a beautiful situation, in the Strath of
Urquhart; but as he resides there but seldom, the house is
occupied by the minister, whose manse is in a ruinous state.
The House of Corrimony, situated at the head of the glen,
is a good commodious lodging, and the place has been much
improved by the present proprietor, who has made many
inclosures, and otherwise embellithed his seat.  On the
north-west bank of Loch Meikly, and estate of Corrimony,
a very neat house has been lately built at Crasgag, now
Lakefield, by Captain Gregor Grant, who has greatly im-
proved the farm, and decorated the place.  On the south
side of that lake, are the places of Lochletter and Shogly,
on the property of Sir James Grant, but held on long lease
by Mr Grant of Shogly, now on Redcastle, and Mr Grant
of Lochletter; these gentlemen built excellent hoases on
their farms, which they improved considerably
