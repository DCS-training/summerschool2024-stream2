and several stone coffins with bones; and, though the most of
these are of the common form, some, without any difference
in the size of the bones, are only three feet square.  On the
lands of Balgay, there is one of those subterraneous dwellings,
or places of retreat, ascribed to the ancient Picts; and,
although it has not been yet explored, it is certainly of un-
common extent.-The skeleton of the first elephant diffected
in Britain, was some years ago to be seen; the diffection was
made by Dr. Blair, an eminent physician of Dundee, and a
a memoir which he drew up concerning it, is to be found in
the London Philosophical Transactions.-From the council
minutes, which yet remain, it appears, that coal mines were
wrought in Scotland, at a much more early period than is
commonly believed; for they shew, that in the 16th century,
coals were the principal and common fuel.  The same mi-
nutes furnish many evidences of the uncertain and changeable
value of money; for, in 1589, the price of a boll of coals,
which probably consisted, as at present, of 800 lb. weights,
and which now sells at 6 s. cost, in 1610, 1 s. 6 2/3 d.  Mr.
David Lindsay the parson, (who afterwards was bishop of

13 bolls of meal, 13 bolls of oats, and 10 bolls of wheat, paid
