Some families in it seem to have a hereditary right to long
life.  There are two brothers and two sisters german in it,
whose father was 96, and their mother 82 years old at their
death, and whose ages, in 1793, when added together, made
310 years.  The eldest of the brothers is still in good health,
and has at present alive 3 sons and 4 daughters, 54 grand-
children, and 10 great-grand-children.  In 1793, there were
likewise 4 sisters german living in the parish, whose ages to-
gether made 312 years.  The people are subject to few dis-

ly reckoned best are from the top of the highest hills in
