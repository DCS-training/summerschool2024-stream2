manures are shell-marle, when it can be obtained, and lime;
but three times more lime is used than marle.  Formerly
these manure were most commonly laid on while a field was
in grass; but of late years much more generally on summer
fallow; and the liming or marling is repeated after ten, or
at most twelve years.  The soil being generally heavy, an
acre requires from 60 to 90 bolls of marle; 70 may be the a-
verage, but the greatest quantity has been found most profit-
able.  The marle a few years ago was got within a mile or
two, at 6 d. a-boll, and then 2000 bolls have in one year been
carried to a farm of less than 150 acres, and 1500 with 150
of lime to another.  That fund, howevers is now exhausted,
and marle at 10 d. a-boll must be got at 6 miles distance.
At Perth may be bought English lime at 2 s; Burntisland at 1 s.
2 d; or Lord Elgin's at 1 s. 9 d. all wheat measure, of which a
single horse cart carries 3 bolls.  From 24 to 40 bolls of shells,
that is, unslacked lime, are laid on an acre, and 1500 bolls are
said to have been carried in a year to one of the largest farms
of near 300 acres.  Perhaps the best managed farms are such
as extend from 120 to 200 acres.  On one of 150 may be
kept eight work horses, three or four young ones, and be-
tween 40 and 50 black cattle, old and young.  The value of
a draught horse is from 15 L. to 25 L.  Four were generally
yoked in a plough, 20 years ago; but two horse ploughs
now almost universally prevail, and single horse carts are pre-
ferred to double ones.  Few of the cattle were fed for slaugh-
ter, most of them are sold under 3 or 4 years old; and 8 or
10, value 4 L. or 5 L. each are kept as milk cows: And as the
calves are all reared, and others purchased instead of such as
happen to die, the butter and cheese sold from one cow, can-
not exceed 1 L. yearly.  A farm of this size requires four men,
two boys, and two female servants.  The year's fee of a prin-
cipal man servant is 10 L.; that of an inferior man, 7 L. or 8 L.
