square, surrounded by a wall of 10 feet in height, a deep
ditch, and a redoubt.  It is surrounded, as already mention-
ed, with a great number of trees, many of which are very
large, and boss and hollow with age.
   One of them, in particular, (an ash), about the distance of
20 yards from the castle, has been boss these 50 years past.
Of this tree, tradition gives many accounts, which we can-
not insert, as some of them seem doubtful*.  This old
castle, with the lands annexed, was purchased 30 years ago
by General Irvin, and sold by him to Mr Graham of Kin-

   This castle is entirely a ruin; some part of its wall is fal-
len to decay, and the ditch that surrounded it is in many
places filled up.

gone off with the schoolmaster, he instantly rode down with full speed to the
schoolmaster's house, and shot him thro' the head in his own door.  Having thus
rendered himself liable to the scourge of the law, his Lordship was pleased to
take up his residence, for some considerable time, in the heart of this old ash,
which is still green to this day, and is known by the name of Burleigh's
Mole.
