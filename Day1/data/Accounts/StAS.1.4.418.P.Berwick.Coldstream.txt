from the town of Coldstream.  The weekly payment being
L. 2:6:11.  The number on the poor's roll 34.  In the
year of scarcity, 1783, meal was sold at reduced to the
poor, at the expence of the heritors and tenants, to the a-
mount of L. 112 Sterling.  For the inrolled poor the quar-
terly assessment was L. 40, 14 s. the weekly pay L. 3, 4 s.
The number on the list 46.  No demand has made on
the session since 1773.  Half of a quarterly assessment was
paid by the session in 1780 or 1781.  The collection money
goes to relieve tradesmen laid off work by sickness, persons
overlooked or not sufficiently provided in the poor's list,
poor whose claims upon the parish being dubious, are not
entered on the list of the heritors, genteeler families decayed
not on the roll, sick and distressed persons returning to Scot-
land,a great number of which pass this way,and the like.
Owing to the high assessment of the parish, the collection is
small.  From 1785 to 1790, the yearly amount of poor's
rates has exceeded L. 220, the weekly pay above L.4.  Two
evils have arisen from the rapid increase of the poor's rates.
The one is, that trusting to these rates, the common people
do not endeavour to provide any thing for a time of sickness
or scarcity, or for the approach of old age.  The other is,
that these rates have, in a great measure, deprived them of
the natural feelings of giving aid to their relations in distress.
The nearest ties of consanguinity are disregarded, and the
holiest affections of humanity are thus extinguished.  No
person almost is ashamed of having his father, mother, bro-
ther, or any other relation, on the pauper's list.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The only part of the parish
subject to inundations is the Lees haugh, which is situated
between the house of Mr Marjoribanks of Lees and Corn-
hill, and which is bounded by Tweed on the S. and E.
