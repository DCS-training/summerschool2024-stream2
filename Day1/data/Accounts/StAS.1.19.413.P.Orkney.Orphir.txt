very improperly falls upon those whose farms are contigu-
ous to it, the rest giving themselves no concern; by which
means it is poorly kept up indeed.

   Rent.-The valued rent is L. 1632 : 18 : 10 2/3 Scotch mo-
ney; the real rent, including the feu-duties paid for the
bishopric, about L. 500 Sterling, besides L. 150, at an ave-
rage, for kelp.  The value per acre of arable land may be
6 s. 8 d. and of pasture 1 s. 8 d.  About 100 fathoms of
peat are sent from hence to the towns of Kirkwall and
Stromness yearly, valued at L. 1, 8 s. per fathom; one half
of these is paid in rent; the remainder, though purchased
with great labour, both of horses and people, is a sure fund
to the inhabitants, as their mosses are inexhaustible.

   Weights and Measures.-The false weights and measures
of this county have long been a source of grievance and
complaint; and in no instance is the oppression more gla-
ring than in the measure of peats paid here by the tenants,
under the denomination of a fathom.  This was origi-
nally a cube of 6 feet square, containing 216 solid feet;
and will it be believed by the generous and free-born Eng-
lishman, that, in a series of years, this measure has been
gradually increased upon the ignorant and unsuspecting in-
habitant, by his inhuman landlord, from 216 to 1008 solid
feet! for the present fathom in this parish measures no less
than 12 feet square by 7 feet high.
   The other weights and measures of this country, which
are of Danish origin, have been also increased in the same
proportion, whether by the landholder, or superior of the
feu-duties, or by both in concert, is now uncertain; but
whoever were the transactors of this infamons business, if
the cries of an oppressed people ever reach the Throne of
Mercy, they have by this time received their just reward.
