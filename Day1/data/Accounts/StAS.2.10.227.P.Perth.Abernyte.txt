the soil itself.  In cases of entail, as much land might be per-
mitted to be sold as would be sufficient.  Multitudes of additional
labourers might be furnished with cottages, and each with a few
acres of improveable land at a moderate rate.  It is unnecessary
to dnter on details.  But it may be added, that in every district
where it may be expedient, there might be a public ploughman with
a pair of horses and implements of husbandry, like common car-
riers at present.  All should be served in their turn, by lot, every
year; and the ploughman might have three or four acres, himself.
As part payment he might get his horses fed for the day, where he
might be working.  How greatly this plan would beautify and en-
rich the country! of what immense importance to the State and to
all concerned, to retain thus by encouragement, and to employ be
neficially, a race of hardy, healthy, and industrious peasantry, of
peaceable and virtuous habits, rather than drive tbein murmur-
ing and disaffected to great towns, where they would necessarily
cause greater stagnations of trade and manufactures, by gluts in the
markets, and, perhaps great and dangerous commotions; or to
banish them expensively to foreign lands, where they may swell the
number of our enemies !  This simple plan would meet the grow-
ing demand for thmber, procure useful employment for the indus-
trious poor, save much of the poor's rates, and in a great measure
prevent the needless drain of the precious metals for many foreign
commodities.  It is unnecessary to say more than that such a plan
as this, with embankments and enclosures, and the draining of bogs
with the making and improving of roads, and such public works,
would afford employment to the industrious, and advantage to all,
besides improving the climate, adorning the face of nature, and ad-
ding greatly to the strength and wealth of the united kingdom.
