L. 12 to L. 14, house, garden, etc. included, together with
any little thing their wives can add to it, which in this
part of the kingdom is really a small matter, as there are
no manufacturers established in the neighbourhood.  The
wages of male-servants in the farmer's family are from

being removed to build sences, a collection of human bones,
half burnt, were found some years ago, in an oblong space,
formed with stones set on edge, and covered with a flat
stone above, without any inscription.  In summer 1789,
there was discovered an urn, and some bones, bearing also
marks of being partly consumed with fire.  There were in
the place, as they describe it, two cavities, one oblong, in
which was an earthen urn, the other lesser and square, in
which were the bones.

betray any discontentment with their situation and circum-
