middle and principal part of the parish, in which both the
church and the town stand, is an extensive and gently slop-
ing plain, beautifully interspersed with small villages, farm
houses, and inclosures; and, taking in with it a small part
of Muckart on the East, and Tillicoultry on the West, it
forms a kind of amphitheatre, of an oval figure, of about 3
miles in length, and one in breadth; bounded by the Ochil-
hills on the North, and a rising ground on the South.  This

and broken in its narrow and rugged channel, through the pa-
rishes of Glondovan and Muckart, it seems to sport itself in
many beautiful meanders; winding from side to side of the
valley, as if loth to leave the delightful haughs of Dollar.
But at times, when swelled by heavy rains, which come
down in torrents from the hills, it suddenly overflows its
banks to a considerable extent, to the no small damage of
the farmer, whose lands are situated by the side of it.  The
river, being small, does not admit of many kinds of fish; yet
there are very fine fresh-water trouts, of a considerable size,
taken in it, as well as sparts, in great numbers. In harvest,
