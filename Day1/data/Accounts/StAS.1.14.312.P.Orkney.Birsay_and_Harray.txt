which were performed at his tomb; that I refer to them.
Certain it is, that the first seat of the bishops of Orkney
was in Birsay, as appears by the S. palace, a very small
part of which is yet remaining; and I do not wonder at
it, because Birsay is one of the most beautiful spots that
could be chosen for the clergy; and they had good skill
to choose them, as is well seen through all Scotland; for
they generally cultivated their spots well.  The modern
name of the parish is Birsay, which certainly is a cor-
ruption of the ancient one.  The form of the parish I
would take to be almost a square, or an oblong square;
for considering, from the sea side to the uttermost part
of the parish, it may be 7 1/2 English miles; from the
bridge perfectly across, it, in my opinion, is 5 miles;
and, considering the hills and dales, I should compute
the parish at 37 1/2 square miles, or thereabout.  The
parish is bounded on the W. and N. side by the sea.  It
is not mountainous, but is however hilly, containing
much game, and pasture for cattle in the summer time.
The soil is vey various in the barony of Birsay; the
N. side in general is shallow, it being a mixture of clay
and thin sand, in some places having a thin bottom of
rock; some parts of the upper end of the N. side hav-
ing tolerable black ground, but rather wettish; S. side,
good sandy ground, but generally produces the steadiest
crops, except when the sea bleaches it.  As to other
parts of the parish, I shall give a description of them.
When I speak of the vile weeds that torment their corn,
I shall add the quality of their ground, and why these
weeds should be more prevalent there than in any other
part of the parish.
