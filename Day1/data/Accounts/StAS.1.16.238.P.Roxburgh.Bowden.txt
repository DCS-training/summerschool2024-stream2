     Statistical Account

   Diseases.-No diseases are peculiar to this parish.  Fe-
vers, at an interval of perhaps 8 or 10 years, have proved
mortal; and the natural small pox carry off many
children.  Inoculation, that salutary mean of preserving
them, is far from becoming general; the Seceders being
much prejudiced against it, though in many families it has
been attended with its usual success.  Consumptions are
not unfrequent; but, on the whole, the people enjoy good
health.

   Ecclesiastical State, schools.-The church is old, long,
narrow, and needs reparation.  A vault adjoining to it is
the burying-place of the ducal family of Roxburgh.  The
coffins are above ground; and some of them, by the dates
upon them, have stood upwards of 200 years, and are still
entire.  An excellent manse and office-houses are newly
finished.  The stipend consists of 5 chalders of victual, Lin
measure, 2-3ds of which are oat-meal, and 1-3d is barley,
400 merks in money, and 40 merks for communion-ele-
ments.  The glebe is 16 English acres, about 3 of which
are meadow.  The Duke of Roxburgh is patron.  The
parochial schoolmaster at Bowden has a salary of L. 8, 6 s.
8 d. Sterling, and about 70 scholars.  Of these, 30 read
English at 1 s. per quarter, 25 both read and write at 1 s.
6 d. and about 15 commonly are taught arithmetic, book-
keeping, and mathematics, on such terms as can be agreed
upon.  The schoolmaster has about L. 3 for collecting poors-
rates, and a dwelling-house and garden worth L. 2, making
in all about L. 30 yearly.  There is also a school and a school-
house at Middleham.  The master has a salary of L. 3, and
gets his victuals, during the teaching season, from the different
families, according to the number of children they have at
the school, which, at an average, is about 30, so that he
cannot draw annually above L. 7 or L. 8 Sterling.
