in the S. are mostly covered with heath, of a thin gravelly
soil, others are of a deep moss, abounding with swamps
and marshes.  The whole range of the Lammermoor Hills,
which in these parishes extend from E. to W. about 8 or
9 miles, are for the most part covered with heath, inter-
spersed with large plots of grass.  The grounds that lie in the
N. are of a deep, rich clay soil, and produce excellent crops
of wheat, barley, oats, etc.  These towards the E. are of
a fine light gravelly soil, excellently adapted for the culture
of turnips and potatoes, both of which are here raised to a 
great extent.  A great part of the soil in these parishes is
either of this description, or of a deep rich clay.

   Agriculture,etc.-Agriculture is the prevailing occupa-
tion in these parishes, as the farmers who rent the Lam-
mermoor Hills rent the same time the adjacent low 
grounds to a considerable extent.  The lands which lie on
the N. of these bills are mostly enclosed, and their agricul-
ture in a state of very high improvement.  Lime brought
from the distance of 4 or 5 miles is extensively used, and 
proves an excellent stimulus.  Turnips, as they are always
raised with dung, and frequently cleaned, have a surprising
effect in meliorating ang enriching the soil.  Fallow is an-
other species of improvement practised with great success, 
and to a considerable extent.  But the greatest improve-
ment in agriculture is that of sowing the land with grass-
seeds, and turning it into pasture for a few years.  This
species of improvement is found to be the belt restorative
where manure cannot be procured.  Excellent crops of all 
kinds of grain are raised, but the most prevailing are those 
of oats and barley; wheat and pease to a less extent.  As
a great part of the soil of these parished is of a fine light
gravelly soil, excellently adapted for the culture of turnips
and potatoes, both of them are raised to a considerable extent.
