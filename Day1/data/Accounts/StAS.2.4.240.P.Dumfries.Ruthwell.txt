The Annandale Society for the Conversion of the Jews also holds
its meetings in this parish. Its annual contribution to that object
is about L. 10 or L. 12.
	To these societies may be added one instituted for the purpose
of purchasing school-books for the use of poor scholars. These
books are not given, but lent to the children, who are required to
return them when no longer needed in the school. Much good has
been effected by this association at a trifling expense.
	Besides the sums thus raised, about L. 6 or L. 7 may be an-
nually obtained in church by extraordinary collections for religious
and charitable objects.
	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The following tabular view of the
state of the poor in this parish drawn up in 1827, for the infor-
mation of the heritors, will afford a more distinct account of the
situation and circumstances of those who receive parochial aid than
could easily be done by, any other mode of representation. The
only alteration made on it worth mentioning, is the substitution of
numbers in place of the names of the individuals.
