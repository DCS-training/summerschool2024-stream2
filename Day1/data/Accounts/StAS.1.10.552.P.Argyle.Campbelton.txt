   Harbour, School, etc.-The town has an excellent harbour,
about 2 miles along and 1 broad, in the form of a crescent,
from 6 to l0 fathom water, good holding ground, surround-
ed with high hills on each side, and an island to shelter it at
the entrance.  We have also a good school with two ma-
rs; the salary of the one (20 l.) is paid by the heritors of
the parish, and that of the other (10 l.) by the burgh.

   Fisheries, Commerce, etc.-The principal trade of the place
is the fishing of herrings.  To this business the inhabitants
naturally turned their attention early, as their situation for
pursuing it was favourable.  They have one of the best har-
bours in the world as their pride and boast.  They are near
good markets, both on the Clyde and in Ireland: And they have
ready access to the fishing grounds, With there advantages,
while (like the Dutch) they kept within the limits of that
economy, which ought to be the characteristic of fishermen,
while they proceeded no farther than their Little stock allow-
ed, and while every man on board had a share of the vessel
and cargo, they did extremely well, even without the aid of
public bounty.  Now the case is altered.  The mode of living
is expensive; the wages of men are high; the fishermen are
no longer owners; excepting perhaps the master who may
have sometimes a share; and, even when that is the case,
may be able, at times, to separate his own interest from that
of the other owners; and, what is still worse, almost every
man in the place, with or without an adequate stock, is am-
bitious to have a share in one or more expensive well found
vessels, or herring busses.  The great rise in the price of oak
staves and barrels, has also become of late a heavy draw-back
on the business.  For these reasons, it has not greatly pro-
spered, although fostered by the kind hand of Government.
