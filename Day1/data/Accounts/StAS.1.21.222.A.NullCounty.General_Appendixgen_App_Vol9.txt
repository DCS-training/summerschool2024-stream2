same manner of process is observed in the case of the eagle
as in that of the fox; the legs and claws are preserved, and
presented before the court on the 30th of April.

   Fish.-Some years ago, this parish abounded with fish of
various kinds, especially haddocks.  There were cod of vari-

for there is still good fishing ground towards the Caithness
coast; but, as our fishers formerly caught their fish almost
within cry of their houses, they have not got fortitude, as yet,
to go any great distance to sea.

   Harbour.-There is an excellent harbour at the Little Fer-
ry, where many ships might lie safely in all weathers; but
there is a bar at the mouth of that arm of the sea, over
which it would not be safe for any vessel exceeding 100 tons
to venture.

   Epidemical Diseases.-There are none peculiar to this parish.
In the course of perhaps 3 or 4 years, sometimes more, some-
times less the small pox, measles, and hooping cough, come
