                     V.-PAROCHIAL ECONOMY.

   Ecclesiastical State.-The stipend consists partly of valued teind
in money, and partly of meal and barley, averaging in whole about
L. 250 a-year. The glebe is fourteen acres in extent.
   The number of families attending the Established church is 42;
families belonging to the dissenters, 20.
   There is no record of the age of the church. The door-way at
the west end in the front is arched semicircularly; the two windows
and door in front at the west and are square and lintelled, and seem
modern,-these two doors and windows are in the front,-and there
was a large Gothic window in the east end, which has now been
converted into a door to a gallery.
   The present manse was built in 1740, and is still seemingly in
good repair.
   Education.-There is one parochial school; its situation not
central. The teacher has the maximum salary, with L. 7, 7s. as
heritors' and session-clerk. His fees may amount to about L. 13
a year. There is another school at the eastern extremity of the
parish, the teacher of which has a salary from the heritors of L. 8.
There are no persons in the parish upwards of eight years of age
unable to read.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-About 32 persons, regularly and
occasionally, receive aid from these funds. The average annual
amount of contributions for their relief is L. 110; of which L. 90
may be raised by assessment, and the rest from church collections.
   Savings Banks.-There is one of these banks in this parish, in
which the amount of deposits has hitherto varied from L. 800 to
L. 1100.
