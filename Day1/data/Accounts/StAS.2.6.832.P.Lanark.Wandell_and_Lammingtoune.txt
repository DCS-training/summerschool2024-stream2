wrapt round with straw ropes, or, in case of the house being slat-
ed, the lumm is then slated also.  The "brace" allows a very
roomy fireside in a farm-kitcben, where the servants are nume-
rous, and is better suited to its purpose than a stranger would
be apt to suppose.  In Wandell, with only two exceptions, all the
farm-houses are covered with thatch.  In Lammingtoune, again,
all the farm-houses are slated, excepting, those possessed by the
crofters, or planners, as the smaller tenants are called.  All the
cottages in this parish, with only four exceptions, are old and of
the poorest description.  Those in the village, generally speaking,
are particularly so; and in reference to this, it was once happily
remarked to me by an amateur artist of considerable talent, that
" he knew of no village in the whole country so delightful to
sketch as Lammingtoune; the situation was so beautiful, the burn
lent so lively an effect, the trees were so old and fantastic, and
dropped so tastefully everywhere; and, then, the houses were so
bad, that nothing could have possibly a finer effect in drawing !"
   Notwithstanding my friend's correct taste as an artist, and my own
partiality for the picturesque, I should be most happy to see one and
all of our villagers put in possession of such snug and comfortable
dwellings, as that lately built, upon his own feu, by Archibald French
in Lammingtoune, with its neat "roof of straw," its little enclosed
garden behind, and a tidy flower plot in front, bordering the pub-
lic road.  Few situations, indeed, surpass in beauty that of the
village of Larnmingtoune,-with its clear winding burn rippling
by, to mingle its waters with the far-famed Clyde,-its smooth
grassy hills forming the background, from which may be seen, in
a clear summer morning, the "top of the lofty Benlomond," sixty
miles to the westward;-the "hill of fire," Tinto, in front, and just
at such a desirable distance, as to enable the naked eye to trace
correctly all its striking and massive outlines,-its fine old trees,
the twisted elm, the stately ash, the lofty beech, all dropt here
and there amid its lowly cottages in graceful variety; and,-not
least in point of attraction,-its little kailyards so trimly dressed,-
with their goosebery bushes, (the poor man's vinery and) and their
apple trees,-their rose trees and southern-wood, * from which to cull,

<FOOTNOTE>Southern-wood is the common but much cherished shrub of the worthy
peasantry of my native land! It is associated with the holiest recollections of
my boyish days,-when, on the third Sabbath of June, (a day in the calendar
still doubly dear to my heart,) and in the church-yard of Kells, and under the
cloudless canopy of Heaven, and surrounded by all those relatives and friends I
held dearest on earth,-I have seen the holy communion table, with its snow white
covering of fine linen, so emblematical of the purity befitting the humble de-
