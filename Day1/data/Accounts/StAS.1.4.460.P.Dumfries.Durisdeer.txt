washed, it sold at 8 s. the stone.  The number of sheep is
about 10,500.  Several districts are remarkabe for producing
mutton and beef of the best quality.  There are 188 horses,
the most of which are employed in agriculture, which has
been making rapid improvement of late years.  Within
these few years, many acres have been employed in raising
potatoes and barley; a few in turnip, wheat, and rye-grass;
but by far the greatest number is fown with oats.  The
parish for several years past, not only has supplied its inha-
bitants with provisions, but exported many hundred stones
of oat-meal and barley to the minin Company's stores at
Wanlockhead and Leadhills, and some to Sanquhar and the
West country.  Many scores of lambs are sent annually to
the fairs at Langholm, Lockerby, Lanark, etc. and some
lambs and fat sheep to Edinburgh:  also a great number
of black cattle of various ages and sizes to England.  When
the season is favourable, feed-time begins here about the
middle of March, and bear or bigg, (a kind of grain with
four rows on each head,) is fown from the beginning to the
20th of May.  In a good season, harvest sometimes begins
on the 20th of Agust.  In 1782 and 1783, plenty of meal
was to be got here for money.  The highest price was 2 s.
6 d. the stone.  The quantity of the ground in
this parish, will appear from the following statement.
