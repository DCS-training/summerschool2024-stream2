This last is considered a very rare plant, and not to be found, so
far as is known to the writer of this report, in any other station in
Aberdeenshire.  The above are a few species selected almost at
random from the different classes,-for the variety in the dens is
so great, that the bare enumeration of them would occupy more
space than can be afforded in a statistical account.
   About fifty or sixty years ago, as I am informed, the medical
men from the Infirmary at Aberdeen were in the practice of paying
annual visits to the dens of Auchmedden, for the purpose of col-
lecting plants for medicinal purposes, and their labours, no doubt,
were richly rewarded.
   At the commencement of the present century, there was not a
tree to be seen in the parish, with the exception of a solitary moun-
tain ash upon the glebe, below the old church; but there is now
a considerable plantation upon Sir Charles Forbes's property, in a
tolerably thriving state, consisting of Scotch firs, larch, spruce,
alders, ash, plane-tree, &c.  Throughout the greater part of Buchan,
wood is of very difficult growth, the country being flat and bare,
and destitute of shelter.

   There is no reason to believe that there is any ancient or mo-
dern history of the parish, either printed or in manuscript, extant,
the former Statistical Account excepted.  The parish has been

<FOOTNOTE>This plant I have never seen, but in the garden at the manse; it is therefore
doubtful whether it be indigenous to the parish.
