   Population.-According to Dr Webster's reports, the num-
ber of souls then was 623.  The number of inhabitants
is greatly diminished, owing to the monopoly of farms, the
mode of labouring, and the farmers some time ago dis-
charging several of their subtenants and cottagers.  In for-
mer times, they laboured the ground with ploughs, drawn
by oxen, each of these ploughs required 2 servants; where-
as, they now use ploughs drawn by 2 horses, and 1 servant.
Upon 1 farm, it is known that the farmer who occupied it,
at a former period, employed 13 men-servants, whereas
the present tenant employs no more than 5.  Then 3
ploughs drawn by oxen were employed,and 6 horses kept;
now six horses perform the whole labour; so in proportion
over all the parish.  And if the proprietors of Wester and
Easter Gaigies, and Muirhouse, had not let a great part of
their lands in pendicles of small farms, our numbers would
not have been worthy of mentioning.  The depopulation of
the parish is ascertained, by comparing the present with
former registers of baptism.  It the years 1734, 1735,
1736, 1737, and 1738, the average was 24.6 baptisms
yearly.  In the years 1761, 1762, 1763, 1764, and 1765, 
the average was 20.8.  In the years 1787, 1788, 1789, 1790,
1791, and 1792, the average is 15.5.  In that part of Easter
