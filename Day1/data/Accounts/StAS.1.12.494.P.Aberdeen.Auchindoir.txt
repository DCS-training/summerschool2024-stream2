     Statistical Account

appears to be the least inaccurate, begins in 1694, at which
time the parish seems to have been more populous than at
present, the annual average of baptisms for 2 1/2 years being
26, a greater number than any since that period.  From 1697
to 1702, it falls as low as 5 3/5; but, in a few years, rises to
about 20.  For the last 8 years, allowance being made for
those who are not registered, it has been only 14 1/4.  The pro-
portion between the males and females, is nearly as 7 to 6.
By an actual enumeration in summer 1785, the parish con-
tained 661 souls, and by another enumeration last spring, it
contained only 572; so that the decrease, in less than 8 years,
has been 89.  The decrease is partly owing to the removal of
cottagers, who had pendicles of land, and privilege of pasture
from the tenants, at the foot of the mountains; the former
being discouraged by the lateness of the seasons, and conse-
quent loss of a great part of their crops since 1781, and the
latter finding they could make more by the rearing of cattle,
than the rents that were paid them.  It is also partly to be
attributed to the demand for labour in the manufactories at
Aberdeen.  Of the 572 inhabitants which the parish contains,
the ages are as follow:
