miles in circumference; the other, which is called the bill of 
Pitsichie, and likewise is inclosed and planted, measures from
five to six miles in circumference, and both together will
amount to several thousand acres.  The whole was begun
and accomplished by the late Sir Archibald Grant, who had
the pleasure of seeing the trees arrive at maturity, and of de-
riving annually a considerable revenue from the sale of wood.
The fir trees, in particular, have been observed to thrive re-
markably here, and although it was the year 1720, before
a single fir was planted, some of them had advanced so
rapidly, that besides a great number of trees, which had been
disposed of for many years back, sufficient work was found
for a saw-mill, which was erected about twenty-four years
ago, for cutting the largest trees into planks, and supplying
the country around with wood of different sizes for carpen-
ter work.  Paradise wood contains a great number of fine
full grown oaks; and, although the family of Monymusk pos-
sess that wood, and another opposite to it, which is not in this
parish, where the oaks are fully as numerous, Sir Archibald
Grant has not hitherto sold any of them.  In the same
wood are fine birch trees, ash, alders, and hazel wood; the
last of which produces frequently great quantities of nuts.
