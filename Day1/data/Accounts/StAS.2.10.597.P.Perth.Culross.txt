		 I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.-THE name is considered to be of Gaelic origin; and
	to be compounded of two words, Cul and Ross, the former signi-
	fying back or side, and the latter a Peninsula : and this meaning
	is certainly descriptive of the town and parish, lying as they do
	at the back or side of that tract of country, comprehended between
	the Friths of Forth and Tay, and which in ancient times went
	under the general name of Ross.  The barony of Kincardine, on
	the west, formerly belonged to this parish, but was disjoined in
	the year 1672, and added to Tulliallan.  It lies on the north bank
	of the Frith of Forth ; the land, particularly that part where the
  town is situated, rising abruptly from the shore.
           The surface of the parish is generally undulating, with conrider-
  able elevation of ground towards the north and north-west, but con-
	taining no hills.  It is about 4 miles in extent from east to west, and
	about the same from north to South.  The soil which extends along
	the shore is, for the most part, very fertile, being of a black loam.
	Tov`rds the middle, it is generally of a clayey nature ; but being ge-
	nerally abundantly fertile, and when under active arangement, which
	is almost universally the case, it produces very heavy crops of all
	kinds. Towards the north and north-west, the soil is naturally much
	poorer; but even there, a great deal has been done since the date
  of the former Account, in the way of improvement; and the land is
	for the most part either brought into a state of cultivation, or is under
	thriving plantations.  It appears that the proprietors had, then and
	for some time before, begun to turn their serious attention to the
	rearing of wood.
    Geology.-The geological structure of the parish presents no-
	thing peculiar.   The soil consists chiefly of clay, mxed in many
