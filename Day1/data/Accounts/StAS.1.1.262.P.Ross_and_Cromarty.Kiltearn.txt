shire.  Ben-uaish is always covered with snow, even in the 
hottest day in summer.  And, in allusion to this, there is
a remarkable clause inserted in one of the charters of the fa-
mily of Fowlis, which is, that the forest of Uaish is held of 
the King on condition of paying a snow-ball to his Majesty
on any day of the year, if required.  And we are assured
that a quantity of snow was actually sent to the Duke of 
Cumberland, when at Inverness, in 1746, to cool his wine.
There is a great deal of heath and coarse grass, which is

true, in this district, as well as in other corners of the king-

of bread in 1782 has impaired the constitutions of several
people in the lower ranks of life, and entailed obstinate dis-
eases on them.  When an infectious fever attacks any family
in the parish, it is generally communicated to some of their
neighbours, and makes several breaches before it ceases; but
