                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   The parish of Monquhitter was disjoined from that of Turriff
in 1649, and Mr William Johnstone, the first Presbyterian minis-
ter after the Revolution settlement, was ordained to Monquhitter
on the 15th November 1727.  Till about that period, this district
was one of the strongholds of Episcopacy in Scotland.  It is true,
that, some time previous to this, Presbyterianism had again be-
come the established form of worship in Scotland, but wherever
Episcopal ministers, holding cures, were peaceably disposed, they
were allowed to retain their emoluments during their lifetime,
which was the case in this parish.  Mr Adam Hay, the last
Episcopal minister of Monquhitter, has left a substantial memo-
rial of the kindly spirit which existed between him and the peo-
ple of his time, in a pair of silver communion cups, and a morti-
fication of 200 merks, (L.11, 2s. 2d. Sterling,) on his lands of
Assleed, the proceeds of which to be applied to any poor persons
residing on these lands.
   Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers commence in,
1670 for baptisms, and	in 1693 for marriages, and with the ex-
ception of one or two chasms, have been kept regularly down to
the present time.

                      	III.-POPULATION.
   In 1755, the return to Dr Webster, from this parish, gave 997,
inhabitants.  In 1757, the number of souls fell short of 800, but
since that time population has greatly increased, partly by the
practice of dividing large farms to accommodate small tenants,
and partly by the reclaiming of waste land, but principally by the
establishment of Cuminestown village, in 1763, and afterwards
of the village of Garmond.  The population of these villages in
1836 amounted to 715, and the country population to 1380, mak-
ing a total of 2095.  By the census of 1841, the population
amounts to 2074.
