Matthew Guild, burgess of Aberdeen, by whom he had
several children, particularly three daughters, all married to
different gentlemen in the town and county of Aberdeen.
   After his death, his widow, Jean Guild, with the con-
currence and approbation of her daughters and their hus-
bands, mortified the greatest part of a considerable property
of her own, for the maintenance often poor orphans, at the
rate of 50 merks yearly to each, under the patronage of the
Magistrates and and Town-council of Aberdeen.  Her brother,
Dr William Guild, Principal of King's College, also de-
stined a considerable sum of money for the like pious pur-
pose, and under the same patronage; from the produce of
which, and the great improvements and attention which
have been made and bestowed upon them by the patrons,
about 40 necessitous orphans are at present in a great mea-
sure supported in the town of Aberdeen, and which they
are entitled to enjoy from their earliest infancy till they
become 16 years of age.
