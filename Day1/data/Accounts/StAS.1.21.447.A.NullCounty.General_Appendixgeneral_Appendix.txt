extent; and they are as sure a crop, and as perfect of their
kinds, as the soil bears.  Flax is only an inferior article, not
being sown as a crop.  Cabbage is very little tried.  We are
pestered of late with a species of annual rye grass, which
grows well for one year, and then dies out.
   The consumption of our cattle stocks at home is incon-
siderable in comparison, with what is sold; most of the fat
used in the parish being brought in from other places.  Of
late, however, there is a method creeping in, of fattening
aged ewes on turnip, which seems to answer well.  With re-
spect to crops, a great proportion of them is consumed at
home.  And the farmers depend upon their young cattle and
their barley, together with most of their sown hay, and
whatever quantity they can sell of oats or oatmeal, to make
up their rents and pay expence of management.
   The returns from rich pasture are good.  Most of the land
inclines to run into white clover, with a mixture of red and
yellow; also rib-grass, daisy, and other indigenous plants,
which we ought to use in sowing out land, though it is to
be regretted that we do not often do our land this justice.
There is a species of grass, which appears naturally, mingling
with the sown grass, succulent in the stalk, and bearing a
light ear like a foxtail; but after a year or two, it disap-
pears, the white clover spreading its knots over the whole
soil.
   The woods produce very little, though they are really of
considerable value.  Excellent oaks, ashes, and elms, with a
few birches and mountain ashes, cover the declivities of the
water courses.  We have also a good deal of planted firs,
but mostly young for sale.  The whole might easily be made
to produce 100 l. a year, permanently.  But the principal he-
titor, out of a liberal view towards the public good, has hi-
therto spared his valuable woods.
