and the diseases incident to sedentary people.  And the wea-
vers, probably from the want of due circulation by the pres-
sure of the seat, are very often afflicted with what they call
fore legs, or bad ulcers in their legs, very difficult to be heal-
ed.  Lime-water has been used of late in many cases with
great success.

   Mineral Springs, and Minerals.-There are chalybeate springs
in different parts of the parish, particularly on the side of the
river Clyde, above Rutherglen bridge.  At Anderston there
is a spring which contains one grain of mineral alkali or soda
in the pint of water.  And at Northwoodside, there is a sul-
phureous spring upon the side of the river Kelvin, which for-
merly was often used, it is said, with success, in scorbutic dis-
orders.  But for a considerable time past no attention has been
paid to it, and the water of the river now runs into it.  This
parish abounds with coal of an excellent quality, and sold at
a very reasonable price, being laid down in the city of Glas-
gow, at the rate of 3 s. 9 d. the cart of 12 cwt.  This cheap-
ness of fuel is of the utmost importance to the comfort of the
inhabitants, and the thriving of manufactures: And as the
fields of coal in the neighbourhood are immense, it is to be
hoped the price will always continue so moderate as to pre-
serve to Glasgow the superiority she at present enjoys above
most places.  Indeed, were the price of fuel to be raised so
high as to injure the manufactures, the coal-owners themselves
would equally suffer.  The value of the coal produced from
the different mines may amount to about 30,000 l. annually.
