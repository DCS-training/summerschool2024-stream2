sown upon a part of most farms through this country, and
of which the farm-meal was paid to the proprietor, (hence
the distinction of farm-meal and white meal), are now al-
most banished from the parish, and the tenant, obliged by
his lease to pay only farm meal pays it in white meal, ha-
ving meliorated his ground so much, as to produce the
white great oat in place of this small black oat; an advan-
tage no doubt to the proprietor, but a much greater one to
the tenant.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-It may be worth while to
observe, that at first starting in the way of improvement,
in this country in general, they had many difficulties to
overcome.  They began with giving so little lime to their
ground, that it had almost no effect.  This, together with
some improper methods of laying the lime on their ground
retarded its progress much.  After they learned to
give the ground a greater quantity of lime, and it became
grateful to them in proportion, they took 6 to 7 crops of
oats successively, and so reduced their ground almost to a
caput mortdum.  They also cropped too much after tur-
nip.  They now, from experience, know better things,
and do not exhaust the strenght of their ground in this
manner, but sow it with grass seed while in good heart.
About 16 years ago, when the first English lime in shells
was brought to this parish, they spoke of it then as such an
expensive manure, as the ground could never repay, and
consequently the farmer could by no means afford.  But at
this present time, the smallest crofter in the parish finds his
advantage in using the English lime in shells, and will go

their ground lime in proportion thereto.  This raised such a spirit of in-
dustry among them, that they have improved their ground more since that
time, than they did for double that period before; and they have upon
the whole, bettered their condition.
