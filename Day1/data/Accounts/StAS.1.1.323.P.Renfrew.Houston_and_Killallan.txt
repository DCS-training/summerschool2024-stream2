   Schools.-The public school is at the church, where read-
ing English, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping and some-
times Latin, are taught.  The number of scholars are about
40 or 50 in winter; but sewer in summer.  There are
also private schools in different parts of the parish.  The
schoolmaster's salary is 200 merks; he receives 4 d for a bap-
tism, and 1 s. 2 L. for a marriage proclamation; and a small
yearly sum as session clerk, and for keeping the registers, par-
ticularly an exact account of the poor's funds.

   Poor.-There is at present near 20 poor people who are sup-
plied from the poor's funds:  Nearly the half of them are old,
and unable to work:  Some of them are poor widows, and small
children; others infirm or diseased.  The poor's slock is L. 260;
the interest of which, with the weekly collections at the
church door, is the only means of their support at present.
They are regularly supplied, with more or less, at the begin-
ning of each quarter especially the aged and intirm, as far
as the money in the hand of the treasurer will go.

   Inclosures, and Rents of Lands, etc.-Most part of the pa-
rish is inclosed; the upper grounds with stone-walls, and the
low lands with thorn hedges.  The rent of the upper and
hilly farms is from 10 s. to 15 s. an acre arable; what is
rocky, and covered with heath, is of small value, very suitable
for planting the Scotch fir, larch, and oaks, though it is not
yet applied to that useful and profitable purpose.  The rent
in the low land, of a clay and loamy soil, is from 20 s. to
30 s. an acre.  The upper of hilly farms produce oats, some
pease, barley, and good dry potatoes.  The firms in the
plain and low land produce oats, barley, pease, beans, and
wheat.  The farmers, of late, have left off sowing wheat,
