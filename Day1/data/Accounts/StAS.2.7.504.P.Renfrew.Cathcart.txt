west of the present Ayrshire road, it again diverged to the right,
-proceeded along the bank of a morass, by what is now called
the Bushy-Aik-Lane, and then conducted directly to the village
of Langside, while the road to Ayr proceeded south, crossing
the Cart at a bridge near the old castle, which still remains.
In crossing Mount Floridon, Queen Mary's, generals must have
seen the enemy'r forces rapidly forming after their hurried march
from Barrowfield on the opposite hill, and preparing to dispute their
further advance. It was determined to give battle, and, on reaching
the Avrshire road, the cavalry deployed into line on the northern
face of the Clineart Hill, there being then no fences to the fields,
but only native furze to impede the operations of the horsemen.
The infantry pursued their way with impetuosity by the common
road already described, while the Queen with her personal staff
proceeded along the road to Ayr to an elevated position, lonc,
noted by a tborn, now marked by a small clump of trees, near the
Castle of Cathcart, whose lord bad recently parted with the pos-
session of it, and was that day fighting in the ranks of her adver-
saries, but with the usual success of the family in military mat-
ters, on the winning side. A division of Murray's horse drew up
on the ground where the farm-house of Pathhead now stands, and
another about balf-way between that and Langside, while in the
latter village were stationed the great body of the infantry and
artillery, whose caniion,-planted in the village gardens, and
raking the direct road up which the Queen's infantry had to ad-
vance,-would, in the more scientific lands of modern gunners,
have effectually prevented that close and almost pugilistic fight,

which, when blades were shivered, was for some time maintained
at the entrance to the village, until the Royal troops were assailed
in flank by the horsemen of the enemy. That the shock of ca-
valry took place in the hollow between the two hills on which the
opposing troops were at first drawn up, is probable, and the more
so. from many relics of the sharp though short conflict having been
found by the present intelligent occupier of the farm, in openidg
a trench some years ago for t o peaceful purposes of agriculture.
When the unhappy Queen, from her station on the Court Hill of
Cathcart, which commanded a view of the whole scene of action, saw
the tide of battle irretrievably turned against her gallant defenders,
she, with her attendants, galloped off by a lane which joins the road
to Rutherglen at the Hagginshaw, and which, from the difficulty
she exverienced in bringing bers horse through its muddy avenue,
is still known by the name of Mal's Mire.
