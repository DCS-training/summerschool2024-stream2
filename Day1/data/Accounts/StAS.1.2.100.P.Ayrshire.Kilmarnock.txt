when ground is to be broke up by the plow, and has not been
lately limed before; but rather less (perhaps 70 or 80) if it
has.  But some have gone much farther; and, when the
ground was a very strong clay, and had never been limed be-
fore, they have found it greatly to their advantage.  One hun-
dred and fifty or two hundred bolls have been used in this case.
The usual method, in this parish, is, to spread the lime on the
ground, in the beginning of the winter before the field is bro-
ken up.  But some judge it better to have it spread on the
ground so long before, that it may remain on it for two win-
ters and a summer;  by which means, it becomes better incor-
porated with the soil; is not so apt to sink into the bottom of
the furrow made by the plow; nor so ready to hurt the ensu-
ing crop, if it should chance to turn out a dry season after it is
plowed down.  It is, however, a general persuation, that
land ought, if possible, to be limed and dunged alternately, in
order to receive the full benefit of lime as a manure:  for if re-
peatedly limed, without a sufficient quantity of dung, and
plowed often, it is gradually exhausted, and becomes, almost, 
a caput mortuum.

   Crops.-Every intelligent farmer, in this district, is now
sensible, that, a proper rotation of crops is of the utmost im-
portance in husbandry; and that the ground, with the same
manure, will continue in equal, or even in better heart, for
at least double the time, under a rotation properly calculated
for the soil, than what it will do under a constant succession of
any one crop.  The same method, however, does not suit all
different soils; and, perhaps, the rotation that is most proper
for each different soil, has not been so much attended to any
where as it ought to have been, and is yet, in a great measure,
left unascertained.  But the proprietors of land, in this part
of the country, have, almost universally, adopted a plan of
