have arisen about their genealogy, as well as that of their
successor Alpine, yet if we consider the declining state of the
house of Lorn, and the growing power of that of Kintyre,
which, ever since the reign of Doncha Beg, extended the
sceptre generally over all Dalruaidh, no reasonable doubt can
remain, in which house the crown would continue permanent-
ly fixed.  Even before the Picts had reduced the power of
Lorn, the house of Fergus had become so powerful, and had
left such inconsiderable territories to that of Lorn, that it
must have been soon annihilated, without the help of a fo-
reign invasion.
   As Alpine and Kenneth could not be of the house of Lorn,
it is still less probable that they should, as a late writer* sup-
poses, be descended from the Picts, and become sovereigns by
right of conquest.  The Picts, about this time, though able
to distress the feeble and exhausted power of Lorn, were by
no means in condition to contend with the house of Fergus,
then at the height of its power.  Instead of extending their
territories and making conquests, the Picts were by this time
greatly reduced, and rapidly declining.  From the annals of
Ulster it appears, that they were about this period not only
harrassed by foreign enemies, but miserably torn by intestine
feuds In 710, they suffered a great slaughter, in a battle
which they fought with the Saxons; and in the same year
were worsted in another by the Dalruaidhins, In 716, we
find them again engaged with the Dalruaidhins, and again
worsted.  In 727 they are at war among themselves, and
great numbers of them slain; and in the same year another
"lacrimabile bellum," or doleful engagement, the same
kind occurs.  Next year (728) we find their country involv-
ed in another war, in which their king is slain.  In 730, they
