Paisley or Stanely Braes, known also, at least in one part, as the
Braes of Gleniffer.  The highest point of these braes, as lately as-
certained by measurement, reaches an elevation of 760 feet above
the surface of the river Cart, at high water mark at Paisley.
Though here and there interspersed with moss and heath, they in
general afford good sheep pasture, and where they decline into
lower ground, a considerable part of the land is in cultivation.
   As the surface of this extensive parish is of varied character, so
also is there variety in the nature and qualities of its soil.  Speak-
ing of the soil generally, it is thin, resting on a bottom of gravel
or till, and very retentive of moisture.  At the same-time, no
inconsiderable portion of it is rich, fertile, and productive.  This is
especially the case with those parts which lie along the banks of
the rivers; and it is reasonable to think, that as much of the soil of
this extensive parish as is capable of cultivation, will very soon be
brought under it; the large town, and the populous villages in the
parish and its neighbourhood, as well as its vicinity to Glasgow,
affording at once means of improvement, and a ready market for
produce.
   Meteorology.-The temperature is upon the whole mild.  The
air is rather moist, probably occasioned by the prevalence of west
and south-west winds from the Atlantic.  The following meteoro-
logical tables are abridged from observations by Dr Rodman, phy-
sician in Paisley, who has been kind enough to favour us with
more extended tables for the whole of the year 1829, and for nine
months of 1832, the year in which cholera made its appearance.
