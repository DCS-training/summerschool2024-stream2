     Statistical Account

in these last ten years, the price of labour, in general, has ad-
vanced in the proportion of 3 to 2.

   Inns, and Ale-houses.-Upon the W. road,  there are two
excellent inns, the New Inn at Pittillock-ford, and the Plaster-
ers, near Balbirnie bridge.  These are superior to most, and
equal to any in the country.  There are 10 ale-houses in the
parish, which sell porter, whisky, and small-beer.  Some of
these brew, and the rest purchase small-beer from brewers,
partly for sale in the house, and partly to supply private fa-
milies with that article.  Though ale-houses are generally
hurtfull to the industry and morals of the people, these bad ef-
fects have not been sensibly felt in this parish.

   Minerals and Fossils.-In the estate of Balbirnie, there is
an extensive bed of shell marl.  The shells are mostly wilks
(periwinkles) and muscles.  When exposed to the air, they fall
in a short time to powder.  The medium thickness of the bed
is 3 1/2 feet under a cover of 7 or 8 feet.  This marl was disco-
vered a great many years ago; and it is surprising, that such
a fund of manure should have been neglected for so long a
time, especially as there is level enough to drain it, at no
great expense.  There is abundance of freestone in the parish,
and some of it of excellent quality.  On the N. side of the
parish, there is a large moss, from which a considerable quan-
tity of peats is dug every year.  These are partly used by
the poorer people in the immediate neighbourhood, and part-
ly carried to more distant places, and sold for the purpose of
kindling fires.
   But what chiefly deserves to be mentioned under this
article, is the plentiful supply of excellent coal, which this
parish enjoys.  Balgonie coal* is within a mile and a half
