   Total annual amount of funds distributed, L. 173, 17s. 8d.
The highest rate Of relief is L. 5, 4s.; the lowest, L. 1, 6s. per
annum.
   Before the litigation about the parish church before alluded
to,the weekly collections at the church door were on an Average
L.l, 10s. per week, or L. 62 per annum.  On the heritors, who
were the chief profiters from these collections, refusing the people
who paid them, proper church accommodation, the church door
collections fell off to 12s. per week, or L. 39 per annum, which
is a diminution of 18s. per week, which has ended in a permanent
poor's rate, and a new church must follow in due time to the
boot.  Such are the unhappy consequences of mutual misunder-
standings.

   The pensioners in the session 1St August 1837, were 41 in all,
27 of whom were females, and 7 widows. The rates per week
were l at 6s.; l at 2s. 6d.; l at ls. 8d.; 3 at 2s. 7 at ls. 6d.;
19 at ls.; 7 at 6d. &c. The weekly sum paid was L. 2, 9s. 2d.
The effects of a poor stent may here be  Watched with great ad-
vantage; and it is desirable that some one would take the trouble
of making the results known to the public.

   Fairs, &c.--There are three fairs held annually in the burgh,
chiefly for the sale of cattle, namely on 2d.Tuesday of May, the last
Thursday of July, and the 21st of October. The market-day is on
Saturday, but is not much observed. The lintseed Saturdays were
formerly great marts for the sale of the commodity, from whence
they derived their names; but flax is not now so much cultivated
as formerly, and these markets have accordingly declined with the
cause which produced them.

   The revenue from the post-office is about L. 230 per annum,
but is much less since the Campsie post was withdrawn. Letters
from Glasgow arrive by a mail gig every morning at six o'clock,
and are dispatched at eight o'clock. Letters arrive from Falkirk
at eight o'clock, and leave at six o'clock. There is a receiving-house
in Cowgate, which closes at half-past seven.

   Inns and Alehouses.--There are about 40 inns and alehouses
in the parish. These are too frequently viewed as the causes of
the corruption of morals among the lower orders, whereas they are
only the effects.
