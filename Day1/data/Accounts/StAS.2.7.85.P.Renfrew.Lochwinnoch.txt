   Besides the minerals and rocks which exist in their natural situ-
ations, there are others of which only fragments are found. These
are chiefly of the primitive rocks, and the most numerous are gra-
nite, syenite, mica slate, and quartz rock; and of the transition rocksi
greywacke. *

   <FOOTNOTE>The following desceription is gives of a magnetic rock in the former Statiatical Ac-
count of the parish.

   "A very singular magnetic rock has been discovered two miles from Castle-Semple.
The compass was sensibly affected all round, the rock to the distance of 150 yards.
The effect was most remarkable on the east and west side of ft, and in every direction
it was greater as the compass was nearer to the rock itself. In its immediate vicini-
ty, or nearly in a perpendicular direction above it, the position of the needle was very
unsteady and irregular, and as the compass was gradually brought nearer the ground,
the deviation from the magnetic meridian was more remarkable, and the vibrations
more rapid. When the compass was set on the ground, the north pole of the needle
invariably directed itself to one small space of the rock, on whatever side of it the
needle was placed."
   This, I presume, furnishes another to the many examples that exest to prove that
"rocks impregnated with iron ore affect the magnetic needle not only from the iron,
which they contain, but also from the portion of the natural magnet imbedded in the
mass." In the New Phileophicall Journal for July--October 1831, there is an ar-
note on this subject. After notfieng thatthe rock on which Dumbarton Castle is
built, possesees this property, a particular account is given of rock on the top of Ar-
thur's Seat, and a table drawn up of experiments made by Mr W. Galbraith, A. M.
and Mr James Trotter, to which it is sufficient to refer in illustration of this subject.
