same quality with that on Esk.  In other parts, where the 
ground is more elevated, it confists of a mixture of naoss
and clay, which, when limed, yields abundant crops of 
oats in dry seasons, such as the last; but on account of 
its wetness, which certainly admits of a remedy, is 
found unsit for the culture of barley and potatoes; at 
least these crops more precarious.

   Woods and Orchards.- This parish abounds in woods.
The number of acres thus occupied cannont be less than
1000.  In the time of the minority of the present Duke 
of Buccleugh, who is sole proprietor of the parish, the 
wood was all natural; but having suffered much by de-
predation, as the writer is informed, that lots has been
since fully repaired, by the numerous plantations made 
in different situations, by his Grace's order.  And the 
woods now placed, under the inspection of faithful and 
skilful overseers, are in the best state and preservation.
The oak reigns here over his subjects of the wood, of 
all denominations, from the creeping ivy to the tallest 
ash.  In the new plantations, plains, beeches, elms, firs
of every description, poplars, etc. are making rapid pro-
gress, being properly senced, and seasonably pruned.  A 
limited quantity of oak is cut down every year; which
furnishes bark to the tanner, and timber to the tenant.
A variety of orchards have been planted at his Grace's
expense, within these 7 or 8 years, upon such farms as 
were thought most favourably situated for that purpose;
and they promise well, for the time.  But there are on-
ly 4 of older standing, that are as yet productive, viz-
at Forge, Woodhouselees, Rowanburn, and the minis-
ter's which, in kindly seasons, yield a good deal of 
fruit, of the best quality.
