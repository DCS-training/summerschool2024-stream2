three different kinds peculiar to Britain are found here: The
gray-hound-fox, with the long bushy tail, white on the top,
skulks on the Fells, and is particularly destructive to the lambs.
The other two species lurk in woods and old waste coal-pits;
the one is low and thick made, of a very dark brown; the
other very small, of a lively red and a black tip on its tail;
the last are the most mischievous to our poultry.  There
are likewise weasles, otters, polecats, hedgehogs, wild cats;
and, of late, several martins have been seen among the rocks.
As to birds of prey, there are four species of hawks; one
pair of the gentil falcon breed regularly every year, in the
Craig of Campsie, a species much sought after by sportsmen;
we have likewise the kistril, that species which we perceive
so frequently in the air, fixed in one place, as it were fan-
ning with its wings, and watching for its sport:  The Goss-
hawk, which builds its nest upon trees in sequestered places,
is likewise a native of this parish; it dashes through the
woods with vast impetuosity after its prey; and the sparrow-
hawk is so common in the upper parts of the strath, that
the children of the villagers amuse themselves by taming
them; both the sluggish inactive buzzard, and the soaring
glade or kite, are natives of this district: So common is the
glade with us, that its various modes of flight are considered
as an almanack for the weather, and its note is a symbol of
moral conduct; we observe, when it soars high in the air, it
prognosticates good weather; and every boy will tell you that
it is not for nothing that the glade whistles; alluding to
note of that bird when it glides though the air, watching its
its prey.  The golden eagle used formerly to build in will
rocks, though of late it has discontinued the practice; but
we have a visit of them annually for some months in the spring
and early part of the summer; they are commonly known
