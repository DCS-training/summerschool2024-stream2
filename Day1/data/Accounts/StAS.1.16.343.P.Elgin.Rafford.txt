barley, oats, pease, beans,-flax and potatoes; there last
are found an useful mean of improvement.  The mode of
preparation is this: An exhausted field is let out in par-
cels, rent free, to poor people in the neighbourhood, who
on their part furnish the manure, labour the ground by trench-
ing it with the spade, plant and reap the crop.  In this
manner, the bottom soil, which is a strong clay, being ex-
posed and meliorated, acquires a degree of fertility which
it does not lose for years after.  The oats produced here
are of a superior kind, and highly esteemed for sowing.
The lands of Cluny, situated in the hilly part of the parish,
are somewhat cold and backward; the soil, however, is

which is rented from the proprietor by the tacksman of
the farm wherein it lies, and by him let out to the quar-

are considerable tracts of moorish and hilly ground upon it,
where the pasture in general is very dry and salubrious.  It
is also well supplied with fuel; for though in some places,
by the abuse of those who have long had servitudes upon
them, the peat-mosses have suffered dilapidation, yet in
others they still remain unbroken; and wherever the pro-

ficient to make up their annual complement.  Mr Duff
has built a very neat modern house, which he has greatly
ornamented, by planting the adjoining hills, improving his
farm, and laying out his fields to advantage.  The ancient
