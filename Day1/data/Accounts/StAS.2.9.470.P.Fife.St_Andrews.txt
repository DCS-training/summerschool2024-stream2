   The vicarage teind was afterwards subjected to a process of va-
luation, and instead of the large sum above-specified, amounting
to L. 337, 12s. 2d. Sterling, it was fixed at L. 20, 14s. 5d. Ster.-
ling, only, which the minister of Cameron continues to receive.
   The Trinity or Parochial Church of the city was originally erect-
ted by Bishop Turgot, about the beginning of the twelfth century.
Prior to the Reformation, it had a large establishment of chaplains
and chorists, who officiated in the several chapel which were within
its precincts. From a charter dated 1475, it appears that they
then amounted to thirty of the former denomination and fifteen of
the latter. They were supported, partly at least, by small annual
payments due to them from the different tenements within the city.
At the Reformation they were suppressed, and their revenues were
transferred by a gift from Queen Mary to the common funds of
the city. This church became the Archbishop's cathedral after
the Reformation, the large cathedral being then demolished. It
was thoroughly repaired in 1798, the expense being defrayed by
the city, the heritors of the parish, and the Crown, in place of the
Archbishop. It now consists of a nave 136 feet long by 57 broad,
and an aisle 44 1\2 feet by 281 1\2 within the walls. It is seated so as
to accommodate 2200 hearers. In the aisle, is a fine monument,
erected to the memory of Archbishop Sharp, a few years after his
murder. The ancient tower and spire of the church still remain,
but a fine old bell, which had hung in it for centuries, and whose
inscription bore that it had been cast by order of David Lear-
mounth, Provost of the city, in honour of the Holy Trinity, in the
year 1108, was inconsiderately removed, to make way for others of
a more modern date.
  Some centuries ago, the city was fortified; and more than once
the citizens were subjected to the hardships and privations of a
siege. Scarcely a vestige, however, of the city walls now remain,
the port or gate excepted at the western extremity of the South
Street, which has a handsome appearance, and is kept in a good
state of repair. The city arms, indeed, above the centre of the
arch, are nearby effaced, in consequence of the wasting of the stone
by the weather, and would require to be renewed.
   The Town-House is very inconveniently situated in the centre
