most romantic scenes in North Britain.  Here hawks nestle,
and their young ones have been frequently carried away by
falconers from different parts of the kingdom.  Here, also,
the natural philosopher and botanist may find ample amuse-
ment.  Two miles farther down this river is the Keith, a na-
tural cascade, considerably improved by art.  It is so con-
structed that the salmon, which repair in great numbers to it,
cannot get over it, unless when the river is very much swel-
led.  The manner of fishing here is probably peculiar to this
place.  The fishers during the day dig considerable quanti-
ties of clay, and wheel it to the river side immediately above
the fall.  About sun-set the clay is turned into mortar, and
hurled into the water.  The fishers then ply their nets at
different stations below, while the water continues muddy.
This is repeated two or three times in the space of a few
hours.  It is a kind of pot net, fastened to a long pole, that
is used here.  The river is very narrow, confined by rocks
composed of sand and small stones.  The scenery, especially
on the west side, is very romantic and beautiful.  Many gen-
tlemen from all quarters repair to this river for amusement.
From the Keith for about two miles down the river, there is
the best rod fishing to be found in Scotland, especially for sal-
mon.  The fishing continues from the beginning of April
to the 26th of August.  The fishing with the pot net is con-
fined to a small part of the river, near the Keith.  When the
water is very small, which is often the case in summer, the
fish are caught in great numbers, in the different pools, with
a common net*.  They are neither so large nor so rich as
those of the Tay.  The fishing on this side of the river was

*Formerly the fish were almost all bought up for the Lon-
don market, at 6 d. the lib. till Whitsunday, and at 4 d. during

the rest of the season.  Last year they were mostly sold in the
neighbourhood.
