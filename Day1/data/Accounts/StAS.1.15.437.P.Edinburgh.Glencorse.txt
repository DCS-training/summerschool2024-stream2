     of Glencross.

6 s.; wool, from 5 s. to 7 s. per stone; ewes with lamb from 10 s.
to 12 s.
   The multure paid by the farmers is 1 peck to 6 firlots of
shilling, and about half a peck of meal to every boll of oats.
The great complaint on this article, is,-that the multure is
measured, not weighed, and that the measures are large and
uncertain.

   Manufactures.-In this parish there is one distillery, one
bleachfield, two corn-mills, one barley-mill, three smiths, two
masons, two wrights, two weavers, one taylor, two butchers,
and one coallier.

   Fossils.-The part of the Pentland hills which is in this
parish, like all the rest of that range of mountains, consists
of different sorts of whinstone, and other lapideous strata,
which are commonly termed primitive rocks.  The lower
grounds in the parish, which form part of the valley of Mid
Lothian, contain fossils of a very different kind, and which
are known by the name of secundary strata.  These are sand-
stone, limestone, coal, and its concomitant fossils, which are
usually called coal metals.
   Through Scotland, in general, these secundary strata occupy
the lower parts of the country; but the mountainous tracts
are entirely composed of strata of the primitive kind.  The
secundary strata stretch through the valley of Mid Lothian,
for about 15 miles, from Musselburgh sands, to the Caerlips
on the confines of Tweeddale, where they are all cut off.  In
several places, they arrive at the skirts of the Pentland hills,
but never ascend them.  They terminate gradually, as they ap-
proach the mountains, and seem, at their termination, to over-
leap, as it were, the primitive strata of which the mountains
consist.
