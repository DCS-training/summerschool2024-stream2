part of the lands inclosed chiefly with dry stone-dikes, which are
preferred to hedges, as the latter are long in coming to maturity,
and decay before they are.very old.
Husbandr ,y.-The principal improvement in farming, of late
years, bar, been in pasturing to a greater extent, and brin-aing into
cultivation above 500 acres of meadow and moss that were formerly
of little value. The chief obstacle in the way of farming has been
the practice of small proprietors working along with their servants.
As they do, not feel themselves called upon to work bard, their ser-
vants imitate their example. Of course, farming is carried on at
much greater expense than is requisite. This, however, is gradu-
allx wearing out. There are 89 ploughs in the parish, and all ' on
the model brought from East Lothian. The author never saw
the long Scotch plough in this parish nor one drawn by oxen, ex-
cept in one solitary instance, when it was employed to tear up
some very coarse land. There are 189 farm-horses, which, with
very few exceptions, will bear comparison with- those of the Lo-
thians; 13 riding-horses, 6 poneys, 12 chiefly for carting, 95 young
horses, 230 milch cows kept by farmers, 40 by servants and trades-
people, 347 calves reared, 1160 young cattle, and many thousands
of sheep.
Quarries.-Though there be very good freestone in the parish,
there is at present no regular quarry. Lime is the only quarry that
is regularly worked, and there is nothing remarkable in the way in
which it is conducted.
