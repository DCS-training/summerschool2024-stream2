acres, should be able to maintain a family of nearly as many
persons; and yet, upon entering their cottages, one generally
finds them snug and comfortable, and is pleased with seeing
a group of happy faces.  Many of them, however, have
either the profits of tradesmen, or work as day labourers.  It
has been more common here to unite the small, than to
divide the larger farms.  The population is usually much
greater, where the farms are small, than where they are
large; yet, the union of farms has not diminished the num-
ber of the inhabitants of this parish*; the village of Scone
and Stormont-field furnishing them both with habitations
and employment.
   If the proprietors of the soil, who dispossess the small to
make room for the greater farmers, would build villages on
their estates, the population would seldom be diminished in
any situation; the wealth and comfort of the people would
increase in proportion to the superior cultivation of the land;
the farmers would find a market for a great part of their
produce at home, and would have day labourers at com-
mand; and the proprietors themselves would derive advan-
tages from the villages, far beyond the expence of erecting
them.

   Inclosures.-A great part of the parish is inclosed; and, on
some farms, young hedges of hawthorn are raising, with
greater attention than was formerly given to this kind of im-
provement.  In the higher lands, the benefit of inclosures is ful-
ly understood; but in some of the lower, fencing by hedges and
dykes is disapproved of, the soil not admitting of pasture.
