nature of the soil; 4th, hay; 5th and 6th, pasture.  Wheat of
late has not been much sown, and that only on heavy lands.  The
rotation of the lands lying near Largs and Fairlie is generally a
four years shift, owing to the nearness of manure.  Flax is now so
little cultivated, that two flax-mills in the parish, one at Constable
wood, the other at Gogoside, have been allowed to fall into ruin.
   The number of milk cows kept in the parish is about 604, all

inhabitants, or churn all their milk, make butter, and supply the
town with butter-milk.  The young cows reared yearly amount
