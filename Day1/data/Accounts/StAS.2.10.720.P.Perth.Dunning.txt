            There are three families of independent fortune who generally
         reside in the parish, and about ten proprietors of land above the
         yearly value of L.50.

                                  IV.-INDUSTRY.
            Agriculture.-The number of acres under tillage is not ascer-
         tained, and there is no land in undivided common.  There are at
         least 200 acres printed, and the average rent of land is about L.2 per
         acre.   Grazing is at the rate of L.4 per ox or cow for the summer
         half-year.  Good labourers generally receive 10s. per week;
         wrights, 12s.  Masons and other artisans are paid at the rates
         current in Glasgow and Perth.  The system of raising white and
         green crops alternately is adopted, and the most skilful farmers
         interpose pasture between their rotations to insure a better return.
         The leases are generally for nineteen years.  The farm houses
         are substantial and commodious stone and lime buildings, roofed
         with slate.
            Draining.-Draining has been extensively practised in this pa-
         rish.  The richest soils have been brought into cultivation by
         means of it.  Upon the estate of Lord Roll alone eighty acres
         of very superior land have been reclaimed by this process, which,
         if let, would bring a rent of L.7 or L.8 per acre.  The draining

         detached portions, containing about twenty acres each, was long
