not of a Gothic appearance.  The main house fronts east, is
4 stories high, with two large turrets.  Many of the rooms
are neat, and in good order.  Some of them are spacious,
and the finest figures wrought in tapestry, are to be seen in
perfect preservation.  From the high story, you ascend by a
cupola to a flat lead roof, which is surrounded by a parapet-
wall, several feet high; and the spectator securely enjoys at
once, an extensive, variegated, and grand prospect.  At some
distant period, a wing has been added to the north end of
the house, containing some elegant apartments.  The house
is surrounded by two gardens, by large inclosures, and by
aged planting, which forms beautiful natural vistas; and
though now uninhabited, in other times it was the residence
of Nobility, and the retreat of Kings.

   Population.-In Dr Webster's report, A.D. 1755, the pa-
rish contained 2668 souls.
