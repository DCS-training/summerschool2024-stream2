happens, from the severity of the spring, that no sowing
takes place till a month later.  The harvest is subject to the
same uncertainty, yet it commences in general about the
beginning of September.

   Horses and Black Cattle.-The horses of all descriptions a-
mount to 374; of these 56 are of the larger sort, and 318
of the small country kind.  The depth of the roads leading
to the mosses, and perhaps the steepness of the ascent, make
it eligible for the farmers and cottagers to prefer this breed
of horses.  Larger ones would certainly sink deeper, and
perhaps not so easily climb the hills.  The black cattle, great
and small, somewhat exceed 600.  Many of these are
draught oxen; but they chiefly consist of milk cows and
young cattle.

   Ploughs and Carts.-Scots ploughs are generally used;
there are, however, about nine chain-ploughs in the parish.
They are sometimes drawn by oxen, generally by horses,
but often by a mixture of both.  About 18 are drawn by
oxen, 48 by horses, and 27 by a mixture of both.  The
whole number of ploughs in the parish is 93.  In the choice
of the species of animals by which they are drawn, the far-
mers are regulated by situation of the grounds, and o-
ther circumstances.  There are only 24 carts, properly so
called, in the parish.  Of the smaller open kind used by
country people in the north, there are about 2410; but
these being seldom used, except in the season for drawing
peats, and in harvest, it is difficult exactly to ascertain their
number.  The farmers collect their manure into dunghills,
and spread it on their fields, by means of a kind of carts
called kellachies.  They consist of small solid wheels, on
which a frame is placed, with trams for the horse; and in
