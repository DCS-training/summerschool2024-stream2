grass.  The N. part of the parish is mostly a mountainous
tract.  Some of the hills are dry and improved towards
the bottom; other are wet, and covered with short heath,
and fit only for sheep-walks, and the raising of young cat-
tle.  On the W. side of the tract, there is a moss of con-

these diseases are neither so violent, nor of such duration
in this parish, as in those to the S.; which is owing, per-
haps, to this part of the country being more hilly; the
waters, consequently, being less apt to run into a putrid
slate.  Formerly, the small pox carried off great num-
bers; but the prejudices againsts inoculation are fast wcar-
ing out.  The people, in general, are become reconciled
to this practice, by seeing the remarkable success with
which it is attended.  Mr. Alexander, surgeon in this
place, has, in the course of the last 10 years, inoculated
upwards of 500, of which number only 1 died.

   Rivers.-Blackater, or Blackwater, is the only river
which runs through this parish.  Its waters are of a dark
