brated translator of Camoen's Lusiad, and other poetical works
of merit; Colonels Matthew Murray*, and John Little, who
have both served with great credit for many years in India.
Colonel Little was honourably distinguished by the brave
Marquis Cornwallis, for his able and gallant conduct, while
he commanded the Bombay detachment, serving with our
ally the Marhattas, in the late glorious war against Tippoo
Sultan, and by whom he was recommended to the Bombay
government in the strongest terms, which, together with the
high opinion that government had of his meritorious servi-
ces, induced the council to confer upon him the appointment
of Quarter-Master-General of the Bombay establishment, as
an acknowledgement of his eminent services.-Capt. George
Maxwell, R. N. who, when Captain Graham of the Preston
was severely wounded in the memorable engagement with
the Dutch off the Dogger-Bank, August 5, 1781, assumed
the command when she was in the most imminent danger,
and bravely beat off the two ships of the Dutch fleet with
which the Preston had to contend; and for which skilful
and gallant conduct, he received the public thanks of the
Admiral.-Ralph Irvine, M. D. who died in India in 1795,
was a young physician of great eminence, and made some va-
luable discoveries in the line of his profession.-William
Keir, Esq. director of works and improvements upon the
Duke of Buccleugh's estates in Scotland, though not a na-
tive of Langholm, is distinguished as a gentleman of science;
of which the engine (vide the Account of Canobie) and
other machinery lately erected at his Grace's coalworks at
Byreburn, and the beautiful wooden bridge, of 103 feet span,
uniting elegance with strength, lately thrown over the Esk+,
on the west side of Langholm Lodge, afford ample proofs.
