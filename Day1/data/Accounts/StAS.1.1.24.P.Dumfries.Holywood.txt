     Statistical Account

cept those afterwards mentioned.  About ten of the inhabi-
tants are small proprietors of lands, which they occupy them-
selves.  There are eight weavers, two bleachers, two shoe-
makers, two millers, five blacksmiths, five masons, four tay-
lors, and eight joiners; all of whom are employed in working
for the inhabitants of the parish, and not in manufacturing
articles for sale.  There are no household servants except in

inhabitants are natives of this island, except one person, only,
who comes from Ireland.  There are no nobility resident in
in the parish, and the gentry amount only to twenty-seven
persons, besides their domestics.  All the inhabitants are of
the Established Church, except six Cameronians, nine Burgher
Seceders, two of the Church of England, and three Catho-
lics; but most of all these denominations attend the parish
church occasionally, except the Catholics.

shall be mentioned afterwards.  They enjoy, in a reasonable
