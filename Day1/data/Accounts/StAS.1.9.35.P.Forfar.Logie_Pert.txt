   Springs, Rivers, &c.-There are several springs, though
not of very great celebrity; one of them is a strong mine-
ral, which is said to be serviceable in stomach disorders.
There is a spring well in the old church-yard of Logie,
which was formerly much retorted to by people who had
sores  There is a very copious spring in Martin's Den,
that would fill a bore of 4 inches diameter, nourishing great
abundance of water, with cresses in its stream, and there
is in a field, near the spot where the old manse of Pert
stood, a plentiful spring of excellent water, likewise feeding
a great quantity of water-cresses.  Both this, and the spring
in Martin's Den, are supposed to be anti-scorbutic.  There
is no lake, nor any river, except the Northesk already men-
tioned, commonly called the North Water, dividing the
counties of Angus and Mearns.  This river furnishes a ti-
tle to the noble family of Northesk, who formerly posses-
sed a large track of land in the parish of Pert, and neigh-
bourhood, on both sides of the river, now in the possession of
the Earl of Kintore and others.  Rose Hill, which gives
title to the eldest son of the Earl of Northesk, is an emi-
nence on the road side, near the gate of Inglismaldie, (a
seat belonging to Lord Halkerton, now Earl of Kintore,)
and a little to the northward of the North Water Bridge;
whereas the Southesk, which runs past the town of Brechin,
gave title to the Earl of Southesk, who was attainted in
1715.

part of it which bounds the parish of Logie Pert are caught,
some years from Conclemas to Michaelmas, (the legal term
