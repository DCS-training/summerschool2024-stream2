last of them was Dr David Sibbald, who having been pre-

suffered much on account of his loyalty in the civil wars,
was imprisoned in London, and had his estate forfeited.
However, he lived to see the restoration of King Charles II.
and died in his own house of Kair, in the year 1661.
   It also deserves to be mentioned, that the celebrated Dr
Arbuthnot, physician to Queen Anne, and one of the trium-
virate with Mr Pope and Dr Swift, derived his birth and
early education from this parish.  He was son to Alexander
Arbuthnot minister here, who was deprived for non-con-
formity in the year 1689.  Dr Arbuthnot received the first
part of his education at the parish school of Arbuthnot,
from whence he and his elder brother Robert (afterwards a
banker at Paris) removed to the Marischal College of Aber-
deen, about the year 1680.

   Language-As the names of the different farms in this pa-
rish are, for the most part, of Gaelic original, it would seem
that, in former times, the Gaelic language had generally pre-
vailed here.  To persons acquainted with that language,
these names all appear to be descriptive of the situation and
circumstances which distinguish the several places.  Much in-
formation might possibly be derived from this source, joined to
the written evidence connected with the district, where pro-
perty has been more fixed than in most parts of the county.
