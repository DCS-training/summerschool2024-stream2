There is a part of a wall yet standing, in a place that is now
very dangerous to approach.  This wall is about 18 feet
thick.  The sea, almost every day, dashes against it in a most
tremenduous manner; for this place is very near the Moile of
Cheunn-Ouib, and it is the most dangerous place in this parish
for any vessel to come near.  All the farms round this fort

they pasture their strong black cattle and horses in summer,
and a part of autumn.  Some parts of these mountains are
barren and wet; but there is some dry soil, where sheep might
find good pasture; and if a great number of them were fed
here, the grass would gradually become better every year.
There are only a few sheep, of a very small kind, that feed on
these mountains, from the time they sow their seed till the
whole crop is got in.

   Wood and Excel.-The greatest part of the wood of Islay,
lies on each side of Loch-Knock.  This wood which consists
of small timber of various kinds, extends above a miles along
the sea.  The whole inhabitants have liberty to cut down
timber, and carry it away at pleasure, out of this wood.  Here
they get bark, and wood for their farming utensils; and some
of them use the supply for fuel, when they are scarce of
