80 yards.  It is said to be the burial's place of Donnan, the
tutelary saint of Eigg; and it lies in a field of arable ground,
and the thin flag covering the sepulchral urn, in which Don-
nan's remains had been deposited, was some years ago expo-
sed by the plough; upon which the urn, being a large round
hollow stone, was taken up and examined, and sound to con-
tain a number of bones, but no scull appeared among them.
It was again buried, at the distance of a few yards from the
place where it formerly lay.
   Among the curiosities of this parish is the Compass Hill in
Canna.  It is called Compass Hill, from its extraordinary ef-
feet upon the mariner's compass.  When a compass is brought
to a particular situation thereon, its needle is immediately
reversed.  The same effect is produced by a steep rock on
the north side of the entrance of the harbour, when a com-
pass is brought near it.  In Rum is a well, called Tobar
Dearg, (Red Well), the water of which is highly mineral;
but very little used by the natives.
   If basaltic pillars may be considered as a sufficient proof
of volcanoes, many of them appear in Eigg and Canna.  In
Canna they appear far distant from the sea; in Eigg, not on-
ly near the sea, but near the top of its higher hills.  Even
Scure Eigg, the highest hill in that island, seems to be prin-
cipally formed of a rock, having much of a basaltic ap-
pearance.  Along the coast of Eigg, rocks are found remark-
ably light and porous, which renders it probable that they
have been once tortured in the fire.  Even places may be
pointed out, where small portions of these rocks seem to have
been formerly in a liquid state.  There are several caves a-
long the coasts of the different islands in this parish, some of
which are not altogether unworthy of notice.  On the S.
W. side of Eigg, there is one called Uamba Chrabhuidh (the
Cave of Devotion), in which the Roman Catholic inhabitants
