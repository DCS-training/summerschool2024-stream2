ture, and approaching near to jet, is used by the poorer
sort of people in place of candle.
   There is little or no freestone in the parish.  A quar-
ry has some time ago been opened in Lee-moor;
one lately at the Boathouses in the S. E. corner of the
parish; and a coarse kind of freestone is to be had upon
the Mouss on the Jerviswood estate, but hitherto has been
discovered no where else.  Limestone is wrought in Lee-
moor and Kilncadzow on the borders of the parish, in con-
siderable quantities; and underneath it, is generally
found a thin seam of coal, often sufficient to burn what is
dug out, into lime.  The rocks in the parish consist ge-
nerally of a brownish micaceous moor stone, which splits
and breaks into thin pieces unfit for any thing but ruble
work.  Clay fit either for bricks or pottery work, may
be had in several parts of the parish.
   The only appearance of mines is in Jerviswood
grounds, where there has lately been discovered a thick
seam of quartz, basseting out to the day, intermixed
with small veins of rich iron ore, but, as such, by no
means worth the working.  As however lead mines fre-
quently put on similar appearances at the top, there is
no saying what may be discovered on going a little deep-
er.  Pieces of very pretty jasper have been picked up,
in the bed of the Mouss, in detached and water-worn no-
dules; as also great plenty of ochres, but no iron stone
excepting about the coal pits at Gillfoot on the skirts of
the parish.  Close by the old bridge of Lanark have been
found in a detached and water-worn piece of limestone,
petrified pholades and cockle shells; which bridge, by
general Roy's measurement, is 362 feet 5 inches above
the quay at the new bridge of Glasgow, and 24 miles
distant from it.
