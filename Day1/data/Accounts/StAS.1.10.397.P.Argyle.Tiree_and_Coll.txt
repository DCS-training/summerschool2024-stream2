it becomes a dear manufacture.  A few experiments of sow-
ing grass turned out well.  The natural grass of most of the
fields is red and white clover and daily.  Frequent but short;
rains, mixing different soils as manures, using compost dung-
hills, with a great number of drains and inclosures, may pro-
mise a joyful harvest.

   Seed Time, Harvest, etc.-The ordinary time of sowing oats
and planting potatoes is from 26th March to the 10th May;
and for barley from the 30th April to the 20th June.  The
harvest generally begins about the middle of August, and is
finished about the 10th October.  The farmers cannot well
begin sowing earlier, owing to wet lands, sand blowing, and
trespass of cattle; but they might to great advantage finish
earlier.  What mostly prevents it is, that barley is the pre-
vailing crop, which gets two and sometimes three ploughings,
and to consumes much time.
   Now, as they are busy inclosing, and can therefore pre-
serve their grounds, it is to be hoped they will attend to this
particular, whence the following great advantages might
arise: They might, earlier sow their corn and hay, provide
fuel, manufacture their kelp, fish more, and, what is now
hardly thought of, manure and otherwise improve part of
their farms in summer, and then finish their harvest earlier
and safer; and so the whole annual rotation of work would
be more seasonable.
   The inhabitants commonly serve themselves in meal, seed,
and spirits.  Hardly any foreign spirits are now imported,
The last season proved rather better.  A few years ago the
usually sold from 200 to 300 Scotch gallons of whisky to
the neighbouring islands.  The parish had then upwards of
30 stills, but is now reduced to three small licensed ones.
Now the inhabitants are increased; and, in the bad seasons
