dition.  There is no school-house in the parish, but the he-
ritors allow the interest of the money appointed by law,
for building a school and house, to the master, to hire one.
The stipend consists of 96 bolls, half bear and half oats,
Linlithgow measure, L. 11: 2: 2 8/12 in money, and L. 3, 6 s.
8 d. in lieu of vicarage-tithes.  But of this last, the pre-
sent incumbent has never realised more than L. 2: 19: 2 2/4,
though he has often applied to the heritors concerning it.
The amount of the whole, (taking the victual at the com-
mon conversion,) is L. 64: 1: 5 2/4 Sterling, exclusive of the
glebe, and which, including arable and grass grounds, and
what the manse and offices employ, is 8 acres 2 falls.

   State of the Poor, etc.-The funds for the poor, are the
weekly collections at the church door.  These of late have
greatly diminished, owing to the increase of the different
sects of Seceders in this part of the county, the Relief,
Burghers, and Antiburghers, etc.  The teachers and mana-
gers of each of which societies, artfully draw off the igno-
rant and unwary from the Established Church, by this
means to make up a salary for their teachers; and pride
themselves to have it not only equal to, but above that of
the ministers of the church.  They give no charity to their
poor; but the whole of what is collected at the door of their
meeting-houses, and what arises from the rent of seats is
applied to this purpose.  When any of their society are un-
fit for labour, by sickness or old age, and reduced in cir-
cumstances, being unable to pay the heavy assessments they
lay upon them, and standing in need of charity; finding
they can reap no more pecuniary benefit from them, they
send them to the church-session for relief.  Thus their prac-
tice has laid the church-sessions under the disagreeable ne-
cessity of acquainting them, that upon their leaving the
church, they will be deprived of the benefit of that fund.
