     Statistical Account

   Climate.-The climate is sharp and cold for the greatest part
of the year.  But this may be accounted for, from its sudden
elevation above the sea, its exposure to the eastern blast, its
general want of planting, and its vicinity to the cold, snow-
covered hills of the north.  It is however a healthy climate,
as appears from the common longevity and healthiness of the
inhabitants, and from their general exemption from agues,
and other chronic diseases.  The sharpest winds are from the
E., the coldest from the N. E. and N., and the warmest
breezes, as well as the finest weather, from the W.  The
south wind is, for the most part, either accompanied with or
followed by rain.

   River and Bridge.-The North Esk, which separates this
parish from Montrose and Logie, is sometimes considerably
swelled by rain and melting snow.  The common passage
through it to Montrose, about 20 years ago, was by a ferry
boat and a dangerous ford, till a bridge was built over it, by
subscription, for 6500 L.  Of that sum his Majesty was pleased
to give 700 L., to encourage an undertaking so useful.

   Salmon Fishing.-In the space of about 2 miles from the
mouth of this river, the proprietors of the salmon fishing,
in this parish, draw a free rent of upwards of 800 L. yearly*.
Between 40 and 50 men, including overseers, bring in all this
profit to the proprietors, besides what they make for their
employers, and their own wages and maintenance.  This too

<FOOTNOTE>

*Kinnabar, being in the parish of Montrose, is not included in this esti-
mate, though the rent, drawn from the salmon fishing upon it, may amount to
200 L. a year.  The author of this article is not so well acquainted with the
state and profits of the salmon fishing farther up the river; but supposes it will
not exceed 50 L. yearly, as far as the parish extend, in conjunction with that of
Logic.
