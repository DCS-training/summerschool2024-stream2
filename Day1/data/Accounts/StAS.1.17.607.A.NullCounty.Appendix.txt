the present house of Pennycuick was built, and also, though
16 miles distant, and in part over a very bad road, the
church and spire of Peebles.  The stone hardens when ex-
posed to the air, and resembles, in appearance, the Portland
stone in England.
   On the south side of the Steel, and west from Harleymuir,
at the meeting of two glens, is a singular rock, of a coarse
freestone grit, composed of small semi-transparent peebles,
resembling a ruinous grey tower, called the Harbour Craig,
(cragg).  Among its rude pillars and crevices are a number
of initials and dates, some of them much earlier, but most of

quarter.

time of Sir David Forbes, brother to Duncan Forbes of Cul-
loden, and uncle to the President; when most of the old.
castle, and the religious house, if any of it remained, was
pulled down, and the present double house erected in its stead,
with a couple of wings projecting from the front, and walls
from these to two pigeon-houses at a considerable distance,
connected by a handsome iron rail.  On the south-west side
of this court was the garden called the Chapel-yard, men-
tioned by Mr Tytler, between and the western ravine;
which, besides the beeches he describes, had also, on the
same side, a square pond occupying its whole breadth, and
