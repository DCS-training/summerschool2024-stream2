There are 28 farms of above L. 50 yearly rent; 84 ploughs, all
drawn by horses, no oxen being employed in husbandry here,
Each plough has two horses, and each farm a spare horse, making
about 200 horses employed in cultivating the soil. All the far-
mers are in the practice of rearing young horses. These may be
stated at one annually for every three working horses upon the
firm; and as they are not generally sold till they are three or four
years old, they may be reckoned about equal in number to the
others, making about 400; besides which there are about 30
carriage and ridin - horses, making in all about 430 horses in the
parish.
About 250 cattle are annually fed upon turnips, and about an
equal number on grabs, so as to be fit for Tthe butcher. A con-
siderable part of these are bought by dealers from a distance, who
drive them to the Glasgow or Dundee markets. Young cattle
and milk cows may be about double that number, making about
1500 cattle, young and old, in the parish. The kind of cattle
bred here is the Fife, with a mixture of Teeswater in some in-
stances. Considerable attention is paid to the breeding of cattle.
The east of Fife Agricultural Society bold their meetings in Co-
linsburgli, and give premiums to encourage breeders. Few sheep
are kept except in parks round gentlemen's houses. Cheviot sheep
are those most generally kept.
