there was found, in a hollow of a freestone quarry near
Castlecary, some wheat, which had become black, and was
supposed to have been there, from the time that the Ro-
mans possessed that station.
   The small river Bonney, which separates a part of this
parish from Denny and Dunipace, seems to be the Cronan

   Old Camelon*, not Camelodunum, but probably Bede's
Guidi, appears to have been formerly a place of conse-
quence.  There are now few vestiges of it remaining; but
not long ago, foundations of houses, and the direction of
some of the streets, were visible.  Much has been said about
the importance which it once had; we have heard of the
riches and ornaments of royalty which were found there,
when it was taken by the Romans.  But we have no au-
thentic documents by which we can decide whether it was
a habitation of some of the ancient tribes of North Britain,
or whether it was only a Roman station.
   It is also reported, that Camelon was a sea-port town;
and in confirmation of this we are told, that an anchor
was formerly dug up+ in the ground near it.  There are
circumstances which authorise us to conclude, not only that
the river Carron has been navigable farther up than the
place where Camelon stood, but also that the sea came
very near Falkirk, and covered the whole of that district
which is now called the Carse.  The name Carse in Scot-
land is generally applied to that land which has been form-
ed by the retreat or exclusion of the sea.  Our carse lands
are very little raised above the level of the frith of Forth,
and in many places are defended by banks++.  The Carse,

entered many houses, but inundated several hundred acres of the Carse land.
