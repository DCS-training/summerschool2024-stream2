cattle.  Many calves in the spring are fed for the Edinburgh
market; and a few horses are bred in the parish.-More
grain is raised within the bounds of the district than what is
necessary for its consumption, and the surplus is carried to the
great manufacturing towns in the neighbourhood.
   The harvest of 1782 was remarkably late, a great quantity
of snow having fallen before the crop was cut; and the corn
was picked out from among it, in the best manner it could.
In several fields the grain was covered with frozen snow, and
hardly any part of the crop was to be seen.
   The foil, particularly next Staven, is well adapted for
turnips, but little of that root has as yet been raised.  From
20 to 30 acres are generally fown with flax, and the produce
is dressed by a water-mill in the village.  The quantity of flax
manufactured there, is from 900 to 1000 stones avoirdupoife,
and about the half og that quantity is heckled.  Little flax is
dressed in any other manner; though, by the hand, is by far the
safest method, and subject to much lest waste, than when wa-
ter mills are employed.  Clover and rye-grass, espacially the
latter, is sown for hay, when the land is allowed to rest.-
White clover is, in most places, the natural product of the
foil.

   Prorietors and rent.-There are about 50 heritors great and
small; of whom Miss Scot of Scotstarvet is by much the most
considerable, having purchased, in 1787, the extensive baro-
nies of Cessnock, Hainingross, and others.-The valued rent
of the parish is L. 4644:3:10, Scots; the real rent from
L. 5000 to L. 6000 sterling.-The greater part of the land
is inclosed.  Good land lets for about 200 per acre, and near
the village at double the fum.
