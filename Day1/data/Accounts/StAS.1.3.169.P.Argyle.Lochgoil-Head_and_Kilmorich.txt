strength, is this district, is the castle of Carrick*.  This
castle if built upon a rock, which was formerly surrounded
by the sea, by means of a deep ditch.  The entry to the
castle from the land, was by a draw-bridge, which was de-
fended by a strong wall, and two small towers.  The castle
itself, is of an oblong figure, but not perfectly regular, as the
architects in laying the foundation, kept in some places by
the very edge of the rock; it is 66 feet long, and 38 broad,
over walls, the side wall is 64 feet high, and 7 feet thick.
Between the castle and the sea, there is a part of the rock
unoccupied, which was surrounded by a high and strong
wall, built round the edge of the rock, within this space 100
men might conveniently stand, for the defence of the cattle,
if it was attacked by sea.  Before the invention of gun-
powder, the castle of Carrick could only be taken by sur-
prise; it was scarcely possible to storm it, nor could it be
taken by blockade, as it had always a free communication
with the sea, for a vessel of any burden will swim along the side
of the rock.  The time in which this castle was built, does
not seem to be ascertained:  It can be traced up as far as the
end of the 15th century, but it is probably much older.  The
tradition of the country is, that it was built by the Danes.
It was a King's house, and the Duke of Argyle is heritable
keeper of it.  It was burnt by the Atholmen.  Nothing now
remains but the walls; and these are not entrie.

   Woods.-In all the mosses in this country, even in those
on the tops of the hills, trunks of trees of various kinds are
found, and there is no doubt that this country was once
much covered with timber.  Old people still remember se-
veral extensive woods, where there is not now the vestige of
