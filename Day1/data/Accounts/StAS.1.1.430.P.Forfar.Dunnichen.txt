     Statistical Account

   High Roads.-The late act obtained two years ago, for e-
recting turnpikes on the great roads, and for commuting into
money the statute labour for improving the parochial roads,
promises soon to effect a thorough reformation on the
roads of this coountry.  The commutation has nearly quadru-
pled the effective labour applicable to the roads, and this
must be employed within the parish where it is levied.  The
proprietor of Dunnichen intrusts the application of the fund
to the principal farmers in the parish, who are far from
grudging to pay a tax from which thsy reap so much bene-
fit.  Many of the roads have, in the first year of the tax,
been formed, and the dangerous parts amended.  The sum
levied in this parish is about L. 27 Sterling yearly, and that
of the whole country exceeds L. 2000 a year.  Turnpike
roads, between Cupar of Angus, Forfar, Arbraoth, Dundee,
are in great forwardness, and will probably be fully com-
pleted in the course of this and the next summer, in te spite of
some ancient prejudices, by which their progress has been
considerably retarded.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The small-pox fequently pro-
ving fatal to the children of the parish, Dr John Adam of
Forfar had attended some days this spring for inoculating
all the children of the parish gratis.  But, although this mea-
sure was publicly recommended in church by the minister,
and privately by the whole kirk-session, yet, so strongly do
the ancient prejudices prevail against this mode of communi-
cating the distemper, that only nine or ten children have
been inoculated.  They have all recovered; and it is hoped
that inoculation will soon become general in the parish, from
the success with which this first experiment has been attend-
ed.
