     Of Chirnside.

the spring, is over, and a suspense of employment en-
sues, there is always a call for such of them as are not
engaged for summer-service, to assist in the planting of
potatoes, performing the work of hoeing them, and
the repeated weedings of the turnip fields.
   To what has been said of the improved knowledge of
the farmers in all the operations of the plough, we have
to add, the advantage and convenience they find in the
number of hinds, or bred ploughmen, expert and able
to perform any agricultural work required of them,
who appear, in the hiring market-days, at Dunse and
Berwick.  Even when a half-year servant is only want-
ed for carting, and other common work upon a farm,
there are few lads here at the age of 18 or 20, used to
country service, who cannot occasionally supply the
place of a hind; and, in lighter land, at least, manage
the plough with propriety and neatness.  It is owing to 
this early usefulness of the young men bred in the coun-
try to the farmers, that their wages, several years past,
were much raised, and generally complained of, espe-
cially by those who could not employ them with equal
advantage.  When, at first, the farmers were averse to
grant their demands, the spirited and stoutest betook
themselves to Northumberland, were the tenants, pos-
sessing long leases, and having coal and lime at hand,
were able to afford the greatest encouragement to la-
bourers of every kind.  It must be acknowledged, that
many of them learned there to do their work more
completely; and such of them as returned here, deser-
ved the wages they asked.  It is near 30 years since no
good labouring servant could be got for less than 6l. or 
above it, and now they are not hired below 8l. or 9l.;
which is just about the triple of wages 40 years
