     of Far.

principal lake is Loch Naver, the length of which is 4 com-
puted miles.  The river Naver runs from it.  There are al-
so some small lakes.

   Fish.-The fish got on the coast are haddocks, whitings, cod,
ling, mackere, etc.  The ling and cod are sent to Aberdeen.
Whales are found near the coast.  Salmon are caught in the
rivers Naver and Borgie.  The greatest quantity, in a season,
is 11 lasts.  They are in the greatest perfection in the months
of March and April.

   Caves.-There are some natural caves near Strathy-head,
where seals are taken.  There is one very large, and 14 small
ones.  There is also a natural arch below Far-head, where a
fishing boat may pass with oars*.  In Rossal, 10 computed
miles from the church, by the Water of Naver-Wiffair, there
is an artificial cave, said to have been made by one William
Munro, which, at the entrance, is wide enough to admit two
men.  The form of it is a curve.  It is at least 100 fathoms
in length, and about as much in breadth; and extends from
Roffal to the river.

   Population.-The population of the parish now, compared
with what it was 60 or 70 years ago, is supposed to have
considerably increased; although the return to Dr Webster,
in 1755, was 2800, and the present population, in 1790, is
only 2600:  Of these, the males and females are about 1300
each.

   Births, from November 1789 to November 1791,   60
   Marriages last year,                           18
