von Company, to establish iron works of considerable ex-
tent.  These consist at present of two blast furnaces, and
are situated on the banks of the river Devon, near to the
old tower of Sauchy.  The situation, and singular con-
struction of the Devon iron works, begun in July 1792,
merit the attention of the curious in mechanicks and ar-
chitecture.  A steep bank rises more than 50 feet above
the level of the river, and is composed of a mock, or very
thick stratum of free-stone, very dry and uniform in its
texture, and almost free from cracks and sissures.  Instead
of the usual method of building with stone and lime, the
several parts of the works have been formed in this bank,
by excavations made in the rock.  Two furnaces, which
are each above 40 feet high, and 14 feet diameter, and also
the spacious arches which give access to the workmen, at
the bottom of the furnace, to draw off the liquid metal
and flag, are cut out of the rock.  The roof which covers
the casting house, a room 70 feet long, 50 feet wide, and
23 feet high, is supported by the sides of the quarry, and
the solid pillars of the rock that were left for this purpose
in making the excavation.  In like manner, is formed the
engine house, and its apparatus, which is intended to supply
the two furnaces with wind, by throwing at each vibra-
tion of the engine a sufficient quantity of air, out of a
large cylinder, into a long gallery or close mine, formed
in the rock.  This magazine of wind will contain above
10,000 cubic feet of air, much condensed by the power of
the engine, as the gallery is very closely shut up, and made
air-tight; having only two apertures, one to receive the
supply of air from the air pump, and the other to admit a
pipe that conducts the condensed air to blow the two
furnaces.
