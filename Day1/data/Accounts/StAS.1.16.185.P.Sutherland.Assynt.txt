   Subdivision of the four Davochs.-The subdivision of
these four davochs is into oxgates of land, every davoch
consisting of eight such, making in all 32 oxgates.  The
practical objects of this subdivision shall be stated under a
subsequent topic.

   Surface.-The surface was represented in the general
description given in the beginning of this account, as
almost wholly uneven, and rocky, having interjacent little
glens, fields, plains and meadows, which, during summer
and harvest, abound with rich pasture, at no great distance
from the several farms and places of residence, near to
which natural grass is yearly cut in August or September
for hay, as the season may allow.  At the extreme marches
with the different neighbouring landed property, the surface
abounds mostly with lofty mountains, hills, extensive tracts
of heath, having here and there soft moss and quagmires,
which often prove fatal to cows and horses.

   Soil.-Along the whole shore, the soil is of various
kinds, stony, gravelly, sandy, mossy, and these for the most
part interspersed with rocks and stones, some of greater,
others of less magnitude; for which cause almost all the
labouring is performed by the crooked and straight delving
spades, implements of husbandry peculiar to this and other
parishes to the N. to the W. and S. W. of Assint.  The
plough affords considerable aid at the farms of Inver-kirk-
ag, Tilin-wintering, Inver, at Oldhey, and Little Assint-
wintering.  The plough might do so, in more or less de-
gree, throughout the several other farms of these three
davochs along shore.  But the inhabitants, being numerous
there, think it easier, and attended with less expence,
