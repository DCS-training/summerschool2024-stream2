                    MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
   The most striking variations between the present state of the
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical
return, are, a diminished population, produced chiefly by the gra-
dually improved arrangement effected by the proprietors in the
division of their lands; the adoption of a regular rotation of crop-
ping, which was then but just commencing; an increased and in-
creasing desire, on the part of the tenant, encouraged by his land-
lord, to lay out his fields tastefully, and to bring every foot of
them under the plough; a more intimate acquaintance with the
best modes of draining, whereby the greater part of the low and
wet lands in the parish has been, and is being dried and rendered
productive; a more enlightened and systematic attention bestowed
by the tenantry in improving the breed of their cattle, and in
bringing them as early, and as far as they can, into the best mar-
ketable condition; and the generally improved position of the
farm-houses and steadings, in reference to every part of the farm,
and the consequent discontinuance of the assemblage of several
farm-houses and steadings in one locality, which proved a source
of no small inconvenience and annoyance to their respective pos-
sessors.  Subletting has, since then, also been almost completely
prohibited, and the proprietors, while they gratuitously give houses
and small patches of ground for a garden to the well-bebaved on
their own estates, who have fallen into decayed circumstances,
and otherwise humanely assist them, at the same time prevent
the settlement of those who have no such claim upon them, and
are likely, at no distant period, to become burdensome to the
parish; and it is believed that, if this plan were more generally
adopted, the poor in each parish would have their necessary wants
amply provided for, and mendicant vagrancy would, to the great
comfort of the community, be ere long entirely discontinued.
The roads in the parish also have undergone a great improvement
since the date of the last Statistical Account.  The old lines
of road have in several parts been improved, and the roads them-
selves put in good repair.  A new line of turnpike has since been
made along the east and north sides of the parish, and another
was finished in 1839, on which a stage-coach now runs daily be-
twixt Aberdeen and Huntly.
