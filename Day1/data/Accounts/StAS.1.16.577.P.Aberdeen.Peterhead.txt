     of Peterhead.

   Ploughs.-The parish was formerly divided into 52
ploughgates, or, I suppose, into as many divisions as 52
ploughs could easily manage in the old style of farming.
At present, in the town and country, I do not think they
exceed 90, though this cannot be easily ascertained.
   There are a few English ploughs drawn by two horses,
or two oxen; in general four, sometimes six horses, are
employed in dragging a Scotch plough; many ploughs are
drawn often by two horses, with a cow and a young steer; I
have even seen, and I observed it last year, a plough with
one horse, a cow and a young steer.

   Harrows, Fanners, and Carts.-There are a few drag-
harrows.  Till lately, many single harrows were used with
timber tynes.  They are still in general too light for the
soil.
   There are no threshing-machines.  Fanners have been
lately introduced, and are now pretty numerous.
   The carts in general are very small, and of a bad con-
struction.  A boll of coals, weighing 36 stone Dutch weight,
is reckoned a sufficient load for one horse and cart when
hired.  There are a few carts of a better construction.

   Horses, Cattle, Sheep, and Hogs.-There are in the whole
parish about 400 horses, for the purposes of ploughing, ri-
ding, and carriages; 900 cattle, and 590 sheep; the sheep
are mostly on the confines of the moor and moss, and have
a very scanty pasture.  In summer, a few ewes and lambs
are kept on tether, scattered through the parish, and excel-
lently fed.  Horses are generally of a small size, and there
are few in the parish of considerable value.
   Excepting what is fed at the mills, hogs are very rare in
the parish.
