lowed to lie for several years in ruins.  Now, houses are rebuilt
before they are totally decayed, and within the last 20 years, move
houses have been built and repaired, than was done before in
the course of half a century.  Though more than 30 new
houses have been built lately in the town and environs, some
will not admit that the population is increased.  The inha-
bitants, it is said, now choose to occupy more room.-That
may be the case; but by the return made to Dr. Webster, in
the year 1755. the souls in the parish of Stirling amounted on-
ly to 3951; whereas, by a pretty accurate survey made
in the year 1790. there were 1188 heads of families, and
4483 souls.-Besides, in this list, there are above 30 families
in the environs of the town, not included.  As the inrolment
of the year 1790 was deemed incomplete, a new one was
made this year, (1792) and the number of souls in the parish
was found to be 4698.  Since the commencement of the sum-
mer 1792, they are probably augmented to 5000, by the in-
crease of hands employed in the Cotton manufactory.
