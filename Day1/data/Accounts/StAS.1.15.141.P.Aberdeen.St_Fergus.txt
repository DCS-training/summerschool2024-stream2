a horse has also a cart.  Some use no horses, but do all kinds of
farm work with oxen.  One farmers JAMES CLARKE in Ne-
ther-hill, uses oxen for his threshing machine, which is the
only thing of the kind, that has as yet been introduced in this
part of the country.  It is to this industrious honest man, that
we are indebted for introducing the shell sand as a manure,
which now turns out to so great account, that many acres,
which would not formerly have produced double the quanti-
ty of the seed, now produce weighty crops both of grain and
hay.

   Exports.-This parish always produces more grain than
is sufficient for the support of its inhabitants; and even in
the year 1782, had the produce been kept within the parish,
there would have been no need of any foreign supply.  About
1600 bolls of grain are exported annually; butter and
cheese to the value of 600 L. Sterling; fat cattle, horses,
and sheep, to a considerable amount; and a small quantity of
hay and potatoes.

   Population.-The population of this parish is somewhat
less than it was 40 years ago.  The following table shows
the decrease, as well as the ages, professions, etc. of the in-
habitants.
