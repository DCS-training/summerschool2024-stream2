   Barley is sown about the beginning of May, a boll to an
acre.  It is sown commonly after turnip, or other green
crop, and is reaped about the middle of September.  Barley
needs to be dunged, if the ground has not been dunged
the preceding year.  Barley, so called, has two rows in the
head like rye: That which has more rows in the head than
two, is called Chester Barley.  The Chester is that which
has been most anciently sown here, and which is still most
in request in the high grounds; but barley is thought the
most advantageous crop in the low country.
   Flax is sown about the end of April, after a shower, or
when the ground is wet.  They sow about 10 pecks of
lintseed on an acre.  The flax is pulled about the end of
August, and yields from 18 to 24 stone of flax the acre.
There is but little lintseed saved.  The flax is laid for five
or six nights in the water, and lies afterwards two or three
weeks on the grass.
   Potatoes are planted about the end of April; that most
commonly used is the kidney, an egg-shaped white potatoe.
There are likewise several other sorts here.  Two or three
bolls of potatoes are cut and planted on an acre, a yard be-
tween the rows, and a foot between the sets.  They yield
from 20 to 30 bolls and upwards an acre.  The ground is
twice ploughed at least before planting; and they are hoed
and drilled with the plough two or three times after.  Their
are, or ought to be, taken up before the end of September.
The rows are taken up by the plough, and gathered with
children and others; ploughed again, and harrowed before
and after ploughing, and gathered at all these times.  They
are kept in winter generally under ground, but sometimes
imperfectly, on account of the moisture getting down among
them, and causing them to rot, heat, and shoot in the spring.
If they were to be kept dry in an ice house, they would
be preserved all the year over from frost, damp, and vege-
