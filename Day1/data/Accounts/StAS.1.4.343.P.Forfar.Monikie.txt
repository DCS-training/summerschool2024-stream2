     PARISH OF MONIKIE.

     (COUNTY OF FORFAR).

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM MAULE.

     Situation, Soil, etc.

   THIS parish is 6 English miles in length, and 4 in
breadth.  Its form is almost triangular, one of the 
angles terminating in the sandy desart situated at the mouth
of the Tay.  On the S. W. and W. it is bounded by the
parishes of Monisieth and Murroes; on the S. E. by Barrie;
on the E. by Panbride; on the N. by Carmylie, and on the
N.W. by Inverarity and Tealing.-The face of the country
is diversified by several large hills.  The soil air are very
various.  The S. part of the parish is distinguished for fertili-
ty.  In the N. and N. W. the soil is more moist, the air
colder, and vegetation more flow; insomuch, that the in-
habitants of the former have frequently their harvest ga-
thered in a month or 5 weeks before those of the latter.
The interposition of a large hill, or ridge of hills, called
Camustoun, or Dunie, makes a considerable alteration in
point of climate.
