     of Peterbead.

pleasant appearance; the S. and S. W. part being termi-
nated by moss and moor, has rather a bleak aspect; but
the N. part has a variety of objects to attract attention and
please the eye; the old castles of Raven's. Craig and Inver-
ugie, formerly feats of the Earl Marischal; the river Ugie, a
small plantation of timber, some elegant farm-houses, the
arches of the bridge of Inverugie, a windmill, a prospect
of the town, and spire of the town-house of Peterhead, ter-
minated by the fed, with a continued field of rich and fer-
tile soil, capable of the highest cultivation, render the pro-
spect very delightful.  Most of these objects are observed
from the high road; but on stepping aside a few hundred
yards to Mount Pleasant, they are seen to greatest advan-
tage, with a few trees, venerable for their size and anti-
quity, contiguous to the house of Inverugie, a corn-mill and
extensive bleachfield on the north side of the Ugie, with the
purling streams, serpentine turns, and verdant banks of
that river, which, taken altogether, form one of the richest
and most beautiful landscapes in Buchan.
   The farther account of this parish will be divided into
two parts, the country and the town; I shall first begin
with the country part of the parish.

   How of Buchan.-About a mile westward from the
town is placed,what is called the How, or Holm of Buchan,
either from being the lowest part of that district, or from a
very striking peculiarity, that on stepping aside but a few
yards from the high-road with houses in your view on each
side, and going down a very short declivity, you soon fee no-
thing before you or above, but a gentle rising of the ground
and the firmament.  I am apt to think this peculiarity cannot
now be found, from the erection of some houses lately in the
parish; at least, I have examined the spot, without obser-
ving the same appearances which were there 30 years ago.
