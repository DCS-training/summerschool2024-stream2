   Library.--A Parish Library was instituted in 1829. It con-
sists of nearly 400 volumes, well selected, and consisting chiefly of
books of history, travels, and religion. It is in a flourishing con-

and has proved most beneficial to many of the contributors, both

in the means it has put in their power of improving their condition
in life. There are at present forty depositors; two-thirds of whom
are servants. The following statement will show its progress for
the last seven years:
