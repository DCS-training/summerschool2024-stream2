     Of Abernethy.

     NUMBER XXXV.

     PARISH OF ABERNETHY.

     (County and Presbytery of Perth-Synod of Perth and Stirling.)

     By the Rev. Mr. WILLAM DUNCAN, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE town of Abernethy, from which the parish takes
its name, is called, in the Pictish Chronicle (published
by INNES, and afterwards by PINKERTON) "Aburnethiye,"
or "Apurnethiye;" the b and p being indiscriminately used
in the Gaelic language.  The name, which Highlanders give
to Abernethy, is Obair or Abair Neachtain, that is, the
work of Nectan.  This NETHAN, or NECTAN the I. began
his reign over the Picts, A C. 456, and reigned 25 years.  He
is said to have sounded the church of Abernethy*, and to have
dedicated that town, and an adjoining district of land, to God
and St. Bridget.

*Other Kings might afterwards confirm and add to the foundation: from
which, as was often the case, they might be stiled Founders.
