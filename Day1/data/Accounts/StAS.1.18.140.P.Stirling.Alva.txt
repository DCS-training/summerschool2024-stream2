are allowed to obtain relief for the one half of that sum from
the tenants, it may be justly wondered, that so very few coun-

   Poor.-The poor in this parish are not numerous.  At pre-

parishes of Logie on the west, and Tillicoultry and Dollar on
the east, veins of copper and lead have been, at different pe-
riods, wrought to a considerable extent; and though veins of
these metals, and also of iron ore, have been found in the hills
of Alva, yet no experiments of such consequence have been
made, as to ascertain their true value.  Some time between
the years 1710 and 1715, Sir John Erskine, of whom men-
tion has been already made, by means of some miners from
