mers began pretty generally to cultivate them in the field.
No crops, it is probable, have proved more profitable to the
farmer than these.-The scheme of farming most commonly
followed is,-oats out of lee,-beans and pease,-barley with
clovers and grass seeds.  After one crop of hay, the field is
generally pastured for three or four years, and then broke up
with the oats.  Little wheat is sown, but rather more of late
than formerly.  Rye, flax, and turnip, are but very little cul-
tivated; hemp not at all.  Oats are sown in March, more
generally in April: Barley from about the 20th of May to
the 10th of June: Wheat in September or October, either
after fallow, after potatoes, or out of lee.  Lime is common-
ly applied upon the lee for the oats; dung and manure to
barley and wheat.  The old Scots plough is generally used,
many farmers having a prejudice against the chain-plough, as
less fit to overcome the impediments to tillage with which
much of the soil in this neighbourhood abounds.  It has,
however, of late been introduced with success, with the im-
provement of a cast-iron mould-board.  The crop, in gene-
ral, is got in in September and October; sometimes, as was
the case this season, (1791) not till the beginning of Novem-
ber.  In 1781, it was all in in August, and was one of the
best known.  In 1782, the harvest was not finished till the
very end of November; and, during that month, there were
considerable falls of snow.
