          PARISH OF LESWALT.

    PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY.

       THE REV. ANDREW M'CUBBIN, MINISTER.


        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.--LESWALT signifies the meadow along the burn.  The
rivulet, on the bank of which stands the old church, takes its rise
out of a large moss of nearly 1000 acres, and forms a beautiful
cascade where it enters the romantic glen of Altdowran, which, sig-

  Extent and Boundaries.--The parish is bounded on the east, by
the Irish Channel; on the west, by Lochryan; on the north, by
Kirkcolm parish; and on the south, by Portpatrick.  It is nearly
8 square miles.
  Topographical Appearances.-This parish is very hilly, and there
are large tracks of moss in the upper district.  They abound in

part of the parish next Lochryan is partly flat; but the greater
part is hilly, and for four miles the soil is very fine, and produces
crops of all kinds, which return very fair profits to the farmers.
The part lying along Lochryan has many advantages: vessels
lie in great safety in Soleburn Bay.  They import lime from Ire-
land, and sometimes shells; and along the coast, the shell sand
has been of real advantage to those who have used it, particular-

with tracts of moss.  Yet of late years, this side of the parish has
undergone a great change.  The coarse kind has been limed, and
rewarded the farmers for their hard labour.  The push-plough has
been successfully used upon the unequal soils; and when the sod is
burnt, and the ashes spread upon, the soil with lime, there are
