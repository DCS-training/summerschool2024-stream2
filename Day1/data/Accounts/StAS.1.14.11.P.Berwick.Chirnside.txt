to the shares of the greater and smaller proprietors, it is
evident, that impediments were laid in the way of any
improvements in agriculture, or increase of population.
The decree of division was the first step that let to views
of the former, as it put it in every heritor's power to cast
his estate into the best shape he could for melioration. 
The many banks of clay marl had, indeed attracted the 
attentioin of one or two of the gentlemen proprietors, and
some feeble trials of it, as manure, had been made by
them; but from want of proper knowledge of its quali-
ties, or of sufficient perseverance in the labout it requir-

done by the late Mr. Hall, within his enclosure, served,
however, as a pattern and encouragement to other heri-

parish, but of the neighbourhood, that two gentlemen,
the late Mr. Home of Ninewells, and Mr. Molle of East
Mains, found it convenient, to take their whole lands in-
to their own management; a circumstance requisite, when
new methods of culture, or new manures, are to be tried
in any part of the country, before the tenants can be sup-

became real farmers of their estates; and residing con-

knowledge in agriculture, but soon taught the tenants,

what the farmers, who had any considerable stock, could
afford.  From them, lessons were taken of more assidu-
