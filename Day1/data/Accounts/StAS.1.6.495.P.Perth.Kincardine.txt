clay was raised, as, in that cafe, it formed a new soil, which,
compressing the moss by its weight, its spunginess produced
no bad effects.
   Moss improved in this manner, after producing some crops
of grain, has continued for 40 years to be good pasturage.
The grass is coarse indeed, but it would have been finer if 
due attention had been paid to keep the drains open.
   As those methods could be used to advantage on the spread-
field only, which is about one third of the thickness of the
moss in its natural state, consequently no very extensive im-
provements could be made by them, when such were aimed
at, the practice of floating off the moss by water was adopted.
   On the moss of Kincardine alone there are 126 families, con-
taining 640 souls, employed in this work.- The water is part-
ly collected upon the moss itself, and partly brought upon it,
by two channels raised by embanking, from the dry-field
which lies higher than the moss*.
   Since 1770, about 280 acres of the moss of Kincardine have
been reclaimed by the moss tenants before mentioned, and
the farmers of the contiguous grounds.
   The depth of the high moss, or that from which no peat
has been cut, is from 8 to 14 feet; that of the spread-field is
from 2 to 6 feet.-The depth of waste moss, which constitutes
the principal part of the spread-field, is in general in the 
proportion of 4 to 8 of that part of the moss which is fit for
peat.-The expence of clearing an acre of the high moss is
from L. 10 to L. 12 and of the spread-field from L. 3 to
L. 6 +.

*In one instance, water is raised from the Teath to the height of 18 feet,
by a Persian wheel, and conveyed about 300 yards in a pipe of 18 inches diame-
ter, which discharges it into an aqueduct that reaches the moss at the distance
of 800 yards.
