June, In April 1678, he was charged before the Council for, keep-
ing conventicles in his house in Potterrow, in the years 1674-
75-76-77 and 78, and for having conversed and corresponded
with Messrs Welsh, Williamson, Johnston, and other intercom-
muned persons.  He appeared and denied the charge; and was
ordered to the Bass, unless be would presently find caution, under
the penalty of 2000 merks, to remove from Edinburgh, and five
miles round it, and that he should converse with nobody but those
of his own family.  " This," says Wodrow, and most truly, " was
a very hard and iniquitous interdict." To the Bass then he went,
and in the damp cells of that dreary and inhospitable rock, he,
with other devoted brethren, lingered out days, and months, and
years, till God quelled the power of their oppressors, and opened
the doors of their prison-house.  About the period of the Revo-
lution he was orderly loosed from Walston, and translated to Dal-
keith.  The people of Walston, however, were far from being sa-
tisfied with his translation, and on 27th June 1689, petitioned the
united presbytery of Peebles and Biggar for advice how to get back
their beloved pastor.  In the end of the year, he returned to his
devoted people.  The manner of his return was not according to
strict form.  But the sufferings of the venerable man, his age and
infirmities, would seem to have been admitted as his justification ;
and on the 22d July 1690, he died minister of the parish, from
which he had been so unjustly extruded, and was buried among
his own people.  In his absence, the cure was served successively
by John Scheill, who was presented by the Archbishop of Glasgow
in 1664, and died May 1677 ; John Reid, who was also present-
ed by the Archbishop. jure devoluto, inducted 28th September
1678, and translated to Biggar 23d December 1685; * and lastly,
by Robert Kincaid, who was presented by the Laird of Walston
(Cr. Baillie,) inducted 28th April 1686, and was present in the
Presbytery of Lanark, to which Walston was then reunited, 2d
May1686.  Patrick Anderson was succeeded by James Brown, who
was admitted 24th September 1691, having been formerly minister
at Kilbucho, where he was ordained and admitted June 5th 1690.
He was translated to Kilbucho, whence he bad come, 10th Sep-
tember 1696.  After a vacancy, Simon Kello or Kellie was or-
dained 24th April 1700, and was transported to Glenholms, 9th
April 1703, where he died 27th December 1748.  John Baillie,
the Laird of Walston, refused in presence of the Presbytery to hear
