There is some grain yearly exported, but less than former-
ly, the grounds being more in pasture.  About 50 score of
sheep are yearly exported for the butcher.  The time of
sowing is in the first good weather in March, and the ordi-
nary time of reaping is in September.  There was ancient-
ly a considerable extent of sheep ground at the head of the 
parish, which was common to most of the heritors, but was
some years ago divided.  There are 12 ploughs, generally
of the Scotch kind: 36 carts.  Besides the residing heri-
tors, who farm most of their lands, there are 6 tenants, and
3 or 4 very small ones.  There are 2 disadvantages this
place labours under.  From its situation, the crops are often
hurt by the early frosts in autumn.  Sometimes the frost
will touch the crop in the month of  August.  In that sea-
son, the hoar frost will sometimes hover as a mist over the
low damp grounds, and the crops in those tracks are more
or less hurt.  It has been observed, that in a field of pota-
toes, growing in a declivity, that on the same ridge of po-
tatoes, in the lower end, the leaves would be blackened
with the frost, while in the upper end, they have remained
in their proper verdure.  The losses to which the crops
are liable through frosts, as well as the advanced price of
labour, are inducing some to turn their grounds more into
pasture.  Another disadvantage, is the great distance from
coal, which is no less than 14 or 15 miles, and the labour
of driving home fuel gives a great interruption to the ope-
rations of husbandry.

glebe is about 6 acres, very good in quality; the inconvenience
arising from the smallness of the glebe, is in some measure
remedied, by the incumbent's renting a small farm of arable
