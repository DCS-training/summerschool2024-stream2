     of Whithorn.

   Church, etc.-The parish church, of which his Majesty
is patron, stands upon part of the scite of the priory, and
is a commondious place of worship.  Near to the church
stands the manse, which is a good useful house.  The
stipend being lately augmented, amounts to about L. 107
Sterling, and the glebe consists of about seven acres of very
good land.  Isaac Davidson is the present minister, being
lately translated to this parish from that of Sorbie.  He is
a married man, and has only one child, a son, Elliot
William Davidson, who has succeeded him as minister of
Sorbie.  Messrs Kelso, Elder, Delap, Maccaul, and Adair,
preceded one another here in the pastoral office.

   Antiquities.-There are the ruins of a church near Isle
of Whithorn, with a burying ground upon the lands of
Robert Hathorn Stewart, Esq.  The people say this was
the first Christian place of worship in Scotland.  Between
these places there is a stone, upon which is inscribed, "Hic
"est locus Petri Apostoli.'
   The remains of several camps and castles appear upon
the coast.  The following are upon precipices by the
shore:
   Carghidoun, upon the estate of Tonderghie, covers about
half an acre of ground.
   To the S. of this, about one mile's distance, islands Castle
Feather, covering near an acre.  Some of the wall of this
fortification remains.
   Going still southward, you meet with another castle,
about the same size with the former; and at Burgh Head
there are works covering three acres.
   These three last are about equal distances from one an-
other, and stand upon the lands of Captain Hathorn of
Castlewigg.
