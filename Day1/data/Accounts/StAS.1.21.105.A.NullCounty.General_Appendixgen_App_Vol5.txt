lish mile from the Cross.  It consists of upwards of 70 acres
of burgage land, besides many acres which have lately been
converted into garden ground.  The extent eastward, to the
end of the Cadger-wynd, is far from being so large, consist-
ing only of 20 acres.
   The city is bounded, on the north, by the land of Cooks-
town; on the east, partly by the lands of Caldhame, and
partly by the lands of Southesk; on the south, by the river
Southesk, and the lands of Beechin Castle; and on the west,
partly by the lands of Beechin Castle, and partly by the lands
of Southesk.
   The suburbs or entry to Brechin, from the east and south,
consist of a row of houses independent of the borough, and
built on ground held in feu from Sir David Carnegie of South-
esk.  They are called the tenements of Brechin; those on
the east, the upper, anti those on the south, the nether te-
nements.
   At the end of the nether tenements, there is a convenient
stone bridge over the river Southesk, of two large arches.
The fords here are quite impassable in stormy weather; and
the inhabitants here and in the neighbourbood, as well as all
travellers, would be much incommoded, were it not for this
bridge.  It was repaired some years ago to great advantage.
It is very remarkable that there is no record by whom, at
whose expence, and at what time this useful and convenient
bridge was erected; and there are no funds appropriated for
its support: so that it must be repaired, when occasion re-
quires, from the common money of the county.
   The river Southesk takes its rise in the parish of Clova.
Some miles from its source, it unites its stream with two ri-
vers and a small rivulet.  After this, it enters the parish of
Brechin, and runs under the bridge at the end of the nether
tenements, dividing the parish of Brechin into north and
