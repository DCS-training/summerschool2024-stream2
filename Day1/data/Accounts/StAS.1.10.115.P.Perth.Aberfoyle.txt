covered with oak, issues into the plain.  The highest moun-
tains bound the vale of Aberfoyle to the north, and display,
in some places, very abrupt rugged and tremendous preci-
pices.  Several streams, and the waters of a lofty cascade de-
scending from them, join the river as it flows amid the
woods, meadows, corn-fields, and farm-houses in the valley.
In this part of the parish the church and manse are situated.
   None of the mountains of this parish exceed the second
rate in height.  Benivenow and Benchochan are lofty hills,
near 3000 feet high, but far overtopped by Benlomond, in
the parish of Buchanan, which, with its pyramidal mass, ter-
minates the prospect to the west.
   The great line of the Grampian mountains, which extends
from N. E. to S. W. from the Girdleness in Aberdeenshire,
to the hill of Ardmore, on the Frith of Clyde, takes its
course, in a very marked direction, through the lower part
of the parish of Aberfoyle.  The course of this range of hills,
as far as has been observed in this neighbourhood, is distin-
guished by a singular arrangement of the minerals of which
the rocks consist.  On the eastern side of this line of moun-
tain, the rock consists of rounded or oval pebbles, from the
size of a pigeon's egg, to masses of 9 or 10 inches in diame-
ter, which contain in them much iron ore, and which seem,
at some period, to have been loose and detached.  They are
now, however, strongly cemented into the body of the rock
by a substance of a calcareous nature.  Adjoining to this, on
the west, are found, from time to time, masses of limestone,
disposed in nests, as the workmen term it, and not in strata
of a regular dip; and no where, in this neighbourhood, is
limestone found, except in this line of the Grampian Moun-
tains, and uniformly on the west side of the rock.  The lime-
stone is blue, with beautiful veins of white.  It admits of a
fine polish, and has been made into chimney-pieces, which
