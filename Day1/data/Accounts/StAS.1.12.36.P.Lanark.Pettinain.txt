rent may be nearly 900 L. Sterling.  The yearly rent of an 
acre of arable ground may be reckoned from 25 s. down to 5 s., 
according to its quality *. 

   Population.-The return to Dr. Webster in 1755, was 330.
There is reason to think that the number of inhabitants has 
decreased since the beginning of the current century.  It ap-
pears, from an old register, that the average number of bap-
tisms in a year was then 11 1/2.  About 30 years ago it was 9: 
and, for 12 years past, it has been nearly 8 1/2.  The account 
which the oldest persons give of the state of the parish in their 
youth, supports this conjecture.  The farms, by being in 
created in size, have decreased in number; and many cotta-
ages have been demolished.  In 1780, when an exact lift was 
taken, the total number was 409:  At the present time (May 
1792), it is only 386.  Of this number of persons these are,

*Price of Labour, etc.-The wages of servants and day-labourers have 
risen considerably of late, from the great encouragements that has been given 
at the iron-foundery in the neighbouring parish of Carnwath, at the cotton-
manufacture near Lanark, and other great works.  For particulars, see the ac-
count of the neighbouring parish of Libberton.  The demolishing of the co-
tages may justly be reckoned one great cause of the increased price of labour, 
in this part of the country.  By this the number of hands has been diminished, 
whilst, from other causes, the demand for them has become greater.
