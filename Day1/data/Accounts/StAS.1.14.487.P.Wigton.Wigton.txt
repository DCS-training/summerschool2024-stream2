     Of Wigton.

   Antiquities.-The most remarkable monument of anti-
quity in the parish, is that in the western end of it, called
the Standing Stones of Torhouse.  It is one of those circles
of large stones, by some thought Druidic temples, by
others reckoned courts of justice.  The stones which form
the circle, are 19 in number, all of unpolished granite;
and all of them still standing erect, as they have been
originally placed, except one, which is fallen down.  They
are of various sizes, as they have been formed by the
hand of Nature; from 2 to 5 feet in length, and from 4
to 9 feet in girth.  The distances of the stones are also
very different, from 5 to almost 12 feet; and the circum-
ference of the circle, on the outward side of the stones,
is 218 feet.  Within the circle, though not quite in the
centre, but toward the S. side, stand 3 large stones, erect-
ed in a straight line from E. to W., of which the 2 out-
ward are about 5, and the middle one about 3 feet high;
the altar, in all probability, on which sacrifice was offered,
before the dispensation of justice, as in Pagan times the
judge was always a priest.  Southward from the circle,
at the distance of 43 yards, stands a large single stone;
and eastward from the circle, at the distance of about 160
yards, stand 3 stones, erected in a line from E. to W.
both of which probably bore some relation to the temple
or court of justice.  Directly to the N., are 2 cairns or
barrows of stones, the nearest at the distance of about 140
yards, the farthest at about 166.  The circumference of
the former is about 240 feet; but the most part of it has
been carried away to build the fences of the adjacent
grounds.  The latter is entire, the figure quite conic,
the circumference at the base about 256 feet, and the
height about 12 feet.
