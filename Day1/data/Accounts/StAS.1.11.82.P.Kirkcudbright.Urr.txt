it indispensible to propagate a dangerous enthusiasm, or to de-
clare himself retainer to a contemptible superstition.
   In his most rational efforts also, to do good, the parish mi-
nister finds himself under one great, one insuperable difficulty.
Whilst almost deprived of the aid, and of the influence of the
schoolmaster, the clergyman finds the same pains, the same
care, the same attendance expected, from every family, from
every individual in the parish, that were usual a century ago.
Nevertheless, the population of the parish is perhaps tripled,
the stipend is the same, and the keeping an assistant is im-
possible.  All this while, the Dissenters, of every denomina-
tion, are not idle.  They are not only establishing, but multi-
plying schools of their own, and clergymen of their own: And,
if public discontent and party spirit are permitted, nay pro-
voked, to effectuate these labours, which might be expected
from the candour, the justice, the benevolence of a nation,
how can it be otherwise than that matters should hasten to a
revolution?  It has often been observed, that a religious esta-
blishment can only be dispensed with in a republic, if there.
Those in power, however, are no doubt best judges, how far
the expence of the church is an object, when the present form
of government is kept in view; in which expence, undoubted-
ly, the establishment of proper schools ought to be included*.

man, who never was a SCHOOLMASTER himself: nor was there ever one chosen
in his parish since he was incumbent.
