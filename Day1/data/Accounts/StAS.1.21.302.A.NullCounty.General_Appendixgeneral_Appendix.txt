     General Appendix to

among the various articles of a work, the plan of which
embraces every object of importance, either respecting the
country or its inhabitants; I confess my surprize was great,
to find, in the earlier volumes, so little attention paid to the
general state of education; or the national means of instruc-
tion provided for the lower classes of the people.  In the lat-
ter part of the work, indeed, the subject has been taken up
with a proper degree of spirit; and the clergy have evinced
themselves worthy of their trust, by the pertinent and libe-
ral remarks they have made on this interesting topic.  A
regular essay, however, it is thought, would exhibit the mat-
ter in a more forcible and effectual point of view, than cur-
sory and unconnected observations; especially, as it is not,
like many other branches of the statistical enquiry, affected
by local differences: and the same remarks are, indiscrimi-
nately, applicable to the country at large.
   Under these circumstances, the following memoir is sub-
mitted to your attention without preface or apology.  It
consists, partly of facts, and partly of observations; points
out the most striking defects and hardships in the mode of
education at present employee in Scotland; and proposes
some remedies, which perhaps might be applied, if not with
success, at least with safety.  Should it afford one hint for
further enquiry, or contribute the smallest portion of mate-
rials to your work, a valuable purpose would be answered.
To that undertaking it owes its origin: an-undertaking to
which the public are highly indebted; as it has given birth
to many excellent papers, which, but for its f fostering pro-
tection would probably never have been published; or, had
they been published, would have been buried in obscurity,
without obtaining the regard due to their merit, or promo-
ting the benevolent intentions of their authors.
