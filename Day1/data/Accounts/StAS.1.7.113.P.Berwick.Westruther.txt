frost or from their flying up into seed, if the winter he fresh,
are often rendered in a great measure useless, long before the
return of the grass, some crop that would answer for food to
the fatting cattle in the spring, is more wanted here than in
the lower parts of the country, where the frosts are seldom
so severe, and where the spring sets in a more early period.
   Early oats seem very much adapted to the climate of this
parish; that species called red oats, in particular, are found to
succeed well.-Beside the dung raised in the different Farms,
the only manure here used is lime, which is brought from
Lothian, at the distance of 17 or 18 miles.

   Horses, Black Cattle, and Sheep.-There are in this parish
160 horses, 700 black cattle, and 5000 sheep.  Considerable
attention, is now paid to the improvement of the breed of,
stock of every kind.-The extent of the different farms is
very various.  The highest may be rented at 2601, and the
lowest about 20 L.  Within these 20 years, some of the farms
have doubled their rents.-The price of labour through all
this country is higher, in general, than in the Lothians, and
not so high as in Northumberland.  A man that is hired
for the year gets  6 L. 10 s. 7 L. or 7 guineas, along with his
victuals.  A day-labourer gains 1 s. per day, or 8 d. with
victuals.  In hay time and harvest he will gain 10 d. or 1 s.
with his victuals.-The price of female labour is consider-
ably raised of late years.  This is, in a great measure, owing
to an additional number of hands being wanted to carry on
the operations of husbandry in its modern improved state.
Many of these operations are performed by the women fully
as well as by the men, such as turnip hoeing, etc.  A female
servant who was hired a few years ago at 30 or 35 s. for the
summer half year, will now, when employed in works of
husbandry, gain 2 L. 5 s. 2 L. 10 s. or 2 L. 15 s. for the fame
