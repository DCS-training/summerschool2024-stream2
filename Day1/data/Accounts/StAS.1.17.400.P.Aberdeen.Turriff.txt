     Statistical Account

Dentergas, afterwards a major-general in the Prussian service,
is mentioned as one cause of its dissolution.
   The poor's funds are managed by the kirk-session, which
meets every fourth month, to distribute to the poor a sum of
money proportioned to their necessities, and the state of the
fund.  A disposition to his effects is generally required of
every pensioner, previous to his being entered upon the roll:
At his death, they are sold to defray the expence of his fu-
neral; and the balance, if there be any, is added to the ge-
neral stock.
   The number and necessities of the poor were so much in-
creased by the bad crop in 1782, that, to supply them, besides
the ordinary collections, some meal sent by government, and
20 L. sent by an unknown hand, the session found it necessa-
ry to take 40 L. from the capital stock.  By means of more
liberal collections in the church, and partly by two legacies
of 20 L. each, and one of 5 L. which, agreeably to the will of
the donors, were given to poor people not on the list of pen-
sioners, but who would otherwise have become such, the
stock is now equal to what it was before the year 1782.
