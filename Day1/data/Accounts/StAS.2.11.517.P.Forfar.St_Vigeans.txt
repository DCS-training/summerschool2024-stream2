  Poor and Parochial Funds.-For some years at the end of the
last, and at the beginning of the present century, an assessment
for the maintenance of the poor became necessary, by the exhaus-
tion of the usual charities. It was, however, only about 1812 that
assessmdnts became constant. Ther annual expenditure on the
poor on an average of three years, was then L.258, 12s. of which
sum, L.93, 3s. was raised by assessment. From that time to the
present, the amount of assessments has gradually increased, and the
average of the last three years is as follows: Raised by assess-
ment, L.508, 14s. 5d.; church collections, L.133, 18s.; mortifi-
ed sums or legacies, L.18, 18s. 5d.; seat rents, proclamations,
morteloths, L.30, 11s. 7 1/2d.; paupers' effects, L.6, 11s. 5d.; total
expenditure on the poor, L.698, 13s. 10d.
	The assessment has hitherto been raised on the landed proper-
ty alone, according to the old valued rent. The number of pen-
sions paid to the regular poor and to the occasional is as follows;
To the regular poor on the roll, 163; occassionally receiving pa-
rochial aid, 30.  The sum expended on the former amounts to
L.647, 16s. 6d.; so that each pension on an average is L.3, 19s.
7d.; the sum expended on the latter was, L.50, 17s. 4d.

                MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	Since the last Statistical Account was written, the populatin
has nearly doubled, the landed rental tripled, the staple manufac-
ture of the suburbs of Arbroath,-the spinning of flax yarn by ma-
ehinery-has been created, the thrashing-mills are tenfold in num-
ber and power, the turnip and potato husbandry immeasurably
extended, the fishing boats of Auchmithie doubled. No proprie-
tor then kept a four-wheeled carriage; now seven do so. The
dress, food, and accommodation of all classes are much superior;
what were foriegn luxuries then, have now become necessaries.
The funds for the support of the poor were then L.70, now they
and L.700; the former sum was then accepted with humble thanks,
the latter sum is craved with murmuring. Loyalty, according
to the writed of that day, was fresh and vigorous, now the suspi-
tion of all power lies deep and rankling. Parents then supported
