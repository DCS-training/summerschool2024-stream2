   There are none just now living in the parish who have at-
tained to the age of 90; three or four very near it.  Two
died lately beyond that age, and one some time ago consi-
derably beyond 100, viz. a Highlander, who had been at the
battle of Killiekrankie.

   Horses, etc.-The number of horses in the parish is 135;
a good breed of milk cows, between the English and the
country kind; no sheep, except the few reared for the gen-
tlemen's tables.  There are at present three, generally four
chaises, none for hire as yet, except during the sea-bathing,
and between 70 and 80 carts, taking in the whole parish.
The canal has greatly diminished their number.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is 1206 L. Scotch,
The real land rent (valuing the ground in the proprietors
hands at a very moderate rent) may be about 1170 L. Sterling.
The rent of the houses in the two towns, from the increasing
demand for them, is higher than in most places of the king-
dom.  The best of the houses, possessed by the owners them-
selves, pay o rent; but, according to a calculation, which
may be depended on, were the whole 169 houses in Saltcoats
