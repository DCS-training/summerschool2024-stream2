   The number of souls amounts to 4366.  The annual ave-
rage of marriages, births, and burials, is as follows:-Mar-
riages 32, births 134, burials 124.  This statement of births,
however, is by no means complete, as many of the dissenters
neglect to register the baptisms of their children.  There is
good reason for supposing that there may be 30 or 40 chil-
dren born here annually, whose births are not registered.
