+It will not be improper, to take notice of a species of manufacture which
has existed in this parish for some ages:  We know that it was manufactur-
ed, to a considerable extent, as early as the reign of James the 6th, which
goes by the name of the Campsie gray; and was then considered as the sta-
ple of the country.  It may be proper to describe it:  It was spun about the
grist of nine cuts out of the pound of wool, each cut consisting of sixty threads
six quarters long; it was dyed a blue colour in the wool, and wove for a pen-
ny farthing the ell, in a ten porter or two hundred reed; they seldom made
it broader than half an ell and a had of dressed cloth; and they fold the
double ell from half a crown to three shillings; so that the weaver had for the
single yard little more than fifteen pence:  It was spun by the women in
private families during the summer; it being customary for each family to
have two of these webbs, one of which was got dressed against Martinmans
and sold to pay the master's rent; the other against New-years-day; the pro-
fits of which went to supply the demands of the family.  The fairs of Kil-
syth were the great markets for the disposal of these gray webs; the servant
lads used to collect from all the neighbouring parish, in order to supply them-
selves with fuits of Campsie Gray; which they would easily do, at the mo-
derate expence of nine pounds Scots; and perhaps, few countries ever supply-
ed a more cheap, decent, and profitable cloathing for working people-It
was all spun, as it is termed, upon the muckle wheel; and a woman used to earn
three pence per day besides her victuals: it would be improper to pass over
the breaking of the gray web, a scene of joy and gaiety, which will not
soon be forgot in this part of the country:  If a private family was to have
their wool prepared for spinning, a number of country lasses were invited in
order to card it; they generally assembled in the barn; during the day, a
large piece of cheese was cut from the kebbock, and wrapt up in a white
doth, and hid by one of the damsels; at the gloming, the young lads used to
assemble, in order to search for this cheese, and peculiarly fortunate was that
young man considered to be, who (having received a watch word from some
of his fair friends,) found out the cheese, and had the opportunity of dividing
it amongst the simpering damsels.  Both the manufactures and days of inno-
cent amusement are gone; nor has the manners introduced by public works
repaired the loss; it must be owned, however, that since manufactures were
introduced, there is an uncommon degree of activity which pervades this dif-
trict, and which accompanies the people in all their operations; and perhaps,
indeed, I would rather be disposed to pronounce the character of the people
in this place inclined to merchandise and adventure.
