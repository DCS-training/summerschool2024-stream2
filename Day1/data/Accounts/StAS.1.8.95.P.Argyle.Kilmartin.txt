great abundance, would yield good crops, and afford employment
and subsistence to settlers.  The introduction of manufactures,
(it is apprehended), would not be difficult, there being an easy
communication with the Low Country.  It is also at no great
distance from the fishing stations; and there is hardly a year,
but there are herrings from July to August, and sometimes
later, in most of the bays and creeks upon the west coast of
Argyll.-There is a salmon fishing on the bay of Crinan, the
property of Mr. Malcolm of Poltalloch.  It has not, hitherto,
been very productive.  The fish, are generally sold in the
country, fresh, from 1 1/2 d. to 2d. the pound; but it might be

favourable.-Coals would be a happy discovery.  There are
no land floods, except the overflowings of a small water,
which runs through a valley for about 6 miles, and falls in-
to the lea at Crinan; it unites with a larger river, which
partly divides this parish from Knapdale and Glafrie, about

qually convenient for building and manure.

   Animals.-Qadrupeds of the wild kind are foxes, hares,
badgers, wild cats, pole-cats, weasles.  Native birds are black
cocks, and muirfowls in the hill; crows, pyots, and wild
