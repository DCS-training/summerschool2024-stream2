   Breeds of Live-Stock.-The breed of sheep is Leicester and Che-
viot, but chiefly the latter; they are reared upon the land, though
many purchase Cheviot lambs at Yetholm and the west country fairs
in summer, winter them on turnips, and sell them after a year's
keeping, so as to procure a return of from 20s. to 25s. a-head.
The cattle are also of a mixed breed. Those reared on the land
are of the improved short-horned kind. The others, kyloes, (High-
land cattle,) are bought at the end of the season for the straw yard,
or fed on turnips, and sold in the following autumn at a profit of
from L. 6 to L. 8 a-head for keeping. Mr Thomson of Earnslaw
has been long noted as a breeder of both cattle and sheep of great
weight and symmetry.
   Husbandry.-The management of the land is good, and what is
called the five-break rotation is commonly followed Bone-dust has
of late been used as a turnip manure, and seems to answer well in dry
seasons. All the land in the parish being reclaimed, inclosed with
hedge and ditch fences, and mostly drained, there remains little
for further improvement. The farm-buildings are in general well
planned and convenient. Leases are granted for nineteen or twenty-
one years. There are no obstacles to improvement on the part of
either heritors or tenants, or from other causes,-except the dis-
tance of lime and coal, which is fifteen or sixteen miles at least,
and of a market for the produce, (Berwick,) which is equally distant.
The grain is all sold by sample. A small portion of it is bought
and manufactured by the west country millers for the Dalkeith
market.
   Produce.-The average gross amount and value of raw produce
yearly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as
follows:

     Taking the area of the parish at                                        4800 acres,
     And deducting for wood, water, roads, and waste land,                    400

     There remains for corn and grass,                                       4400

     On third of which render a crop,                                        1466 2/3

Taking 1/12 == 366 2/3 acres in wheat, at 5 bolls per acre,== 1833 bolls, L. 3772 18 6
       1/12 == 366 2/3 do. in barley, at 6 do.         do. == 2200 do.       2704  3 4
       2/12 == 733 1/3 do. in oats, at 7 do.           do. == 5133 do.       4876  7 0

Supposing 78 hinds and cottars to raise (as before-mentioned,) 10 bolls
   of potatoes each,                                          780 do.
            10 tenants 50 bolls each on an average,           500 do.

                           Total at 6s. per boll,            1280              384  0 0
Supposing one-sixth of the land in fallow, one-half of which in turnips
