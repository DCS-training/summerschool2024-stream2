	The introduction of spirits by the Highland traders, so prevalent
some years ago, has been entirely suppressed; and poaching for
game has become much less common of late years, from the ac-
tive measures employed by a game-association, instituted among
the principal landed gentlemen of the county, for the punishment
of this species of delinquency. The practice of po`ching for sal-
mon still prevails, as, notwithstanding the care with with the river
is guarded, fresh salmon may, it is said, be privately obtained at
all times during the close season, from parties in the town and
neighbourhood of Montrose, by whom this illicit trade is car-
ried on.
