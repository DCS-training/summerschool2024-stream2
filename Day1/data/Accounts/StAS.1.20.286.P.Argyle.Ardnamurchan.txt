<FOOTNOTE>

*Scarce any local descriptive name occurs so frequently in Scotland, par-
ticularly on the sea-coasts, as Aird, commonly wrote, and confounded with,
Ard, high, a height.   Applied to land, Aird signifies a point or angle, both
sides of which are bounded by water.   A thousand instances might be spe-
cified, as Aird-nan-saor, on which Fort George stands, etc.   In this parish,
Aird-nish is a peninsula, three miles long; and there are many lesser points,
called Aird, one of which is so low, as to be overflowed by high tides.
