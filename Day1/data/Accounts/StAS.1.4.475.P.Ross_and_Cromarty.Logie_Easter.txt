attend and assist in carrying their corn-steaks from the barn-
yard into the barn.  The servitudes which disgraced human
nature, by rendering tenantsn almost slaves, are, in this parish,
done away; and I hope the day is fast approaching, when
proprietors will find it proper to have their rents paid in
victual and money only.  The greatest farmers pay about
L. 60 Sterling yearly rent in victual and money, and some
of them not L. 5 Sterling.  The principal crops are oats,
barley, and potatoes, which last are the support of ma-
ny poor families, with some little meal, for more than half
of the year.  There grows also a considerable quantity of peas,
and rye.  the proprietors, and even farmers, now sow clo-
ver and rye-grass, and find this the most profitable way of
resting their lands, after which they get rich crops.  of e-
very kind of grain, a far greater quantity grows than serves
the inhabitants.  A considerable quantity of barley is used
in malting, for ale, and to serve the distilleries around us in
other parishes, there being none licensed here.  Oats, bar-
ley, and oat-meal are sold here to persons at distance, and
sometimes sent out of the country.-There are about 600
horses, nearly twice the number of oxen, and a considerable
quantity of milk cows.  The horses are generally small, but
even the farmers have begun the custom of supplying them-
selves with those of a large size from Moray; and this bet-
ters the breed of horses here.  The number of sheep is not
so considerable now as formerly, the gentlemen in this pa-
rish rather cultivating milk cows, and the tenants not having
the same range for their sheep, by the improvement of 
wastle ground.

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-About 24 years ago,
the present neat little church was built on an eminence, at
some distance from the hollow where it formerly stood.
