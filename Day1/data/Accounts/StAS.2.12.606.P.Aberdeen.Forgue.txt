to be paid by the vicarage-teinds:  Now, it so happens, in this
parish, that one of the heritors guarantees several of the others
against all future augmentations of stipend; but so far only as the
great or parsonage-teinds are concerned; hence, in the event of
an augmentation being granted, as affects these heritors, say to
the amount of L.9, 10s., if the above data be correct, it would
come thus to be divided; the guaranteer would have to pay L.5,
10s., and the guaranteed L.4 of the said augmentation.
   There seems to have been no farther augmentation for upwards
of the next sixty years, as the writer of the former Statistical Ac-
count, about 1796, states the stipend then to be 44 bolls of meal,
20 bolls of bear, 500 merks Scots of money, together with 50
merks Scots for communion elements.
   A year or two afterwards, the stipend was augmented to 52 bolls
of meal, 20 bolls of bear, L.58, 1s. 1 1/2d., Sterling, of money sti-
pend, and for element money, L.2, 15s. 6 1/2d. Sterling.
   In 1803, it would appear the stipend was again augmented to
68 bolls of meal, 28 bolls of bear, and L.52, 10s. Sterling of
money, together with L.8, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for communion elements.
   In 1819, the stipend was raised to 14 chalders, half meal and
half barley, with L.8, 6s. 8d. for element money.
   In 1840, 25th November, the stipend was augmented to 16
chalders, half meal and half barley, with L.1O for element money.
   Ministers.-The first Presbyterian minister that we hear of at
Forgue was the Rev. John Maitland.  He succeeded the last
Episcopal clergyman, Mr Hastie, and, as appears from the record
of presbytery, was translated from Insch by order of the synod,
and settled at Forgue, on the 22d of May 1707. *  This reverend

<FOOTNOTE>The presbytery record, which extends back to 1697, shows that the Episcopal
Clergymen in this district had abundantly availed themselves of the merciful provi-
sion made in their behalf, by the act 1690.  By that act, those of them who should
conduct themselves peaceably were allowed to continue to discharge the duties of
their cures, and enjoy the emoluments of their benefices till death. Their principles,
in most cases, yielded to their interests; and they conformed themselves readily, if
not heartily, to the established order of things.   Accordingly, we find, that, at 1697,
of the eleven parishes, which now constitute the presbytery of Turriff, ten were under
the inspection of Episcopal clergymen, namely, Forgue, Drumblade, Inverkeithnie,
Auchterless, Fyvie, Monquhitter, King-Edward, Gamery, Alvah, and Forglen.
Turriff, at the period, was the only parish in which a Presbyterian minister was
settled, in the person of the Rev. Thomas Thomson.  The first Presbyterian mi-
nisters who were settled in the ten parishes of the presbytery, were the follow-
ing, via.
   The Rev. william Johnston (from Kearn) was settled at Auchterless, on the
6th of May 1697.
   The Rev. James Maitland (who was deposed in 1715) was settled at Inverkeith-
nic on the 14th of May 1701.
   The Rev. John Turing was settled at Drumblade on the 18th, of August 1702.
