			CARSTAIRS.    			     555

The bullet and the greater part of the coins are now in the pos-
session of Henry Monteith, Esq.
	Remarkable Occurrences.--In 1639, 13th April, Mr John Lind-
say, minister of Carstairs, was deposed from the office of the mi-
nistry for adherence to the Service-book and the Bishops; and on
the 30th of April in the following year, he was again admitted to
the ministry of Carstairs by the imposition of hands.
	On the 26th of May 1642, Mr John Lindsay reported to the
presbytery, "that thro' occasion of a tumultuous brithal and pro-
miscuous dancing at Carstairs, there must have fallen out, except
the Lord in his mercy had prevented it, great mischief and blood."
The presbytery, taking it into their serious consideration, " Ratify
their former acts against number and peace at pennie brithals, and
for preventing the like danger in tyme coming, ordains farder, that
there be no promiscuous dancing, or excessive drinking, under the
loss of the consigned money; and, in the meantime, ordains George
Ogston to summons Thomas Lithgow, the author of the tumult,
to compear before the session of Carstairs, under pain of the cen-
sures of the kirk."
	1648, 7th December.--Proportion each parish was to pay for a
bursar at Glasgow, as settled by Mr John Lindsay; Lanark,
L.22; Lesmahagow, L.22; Carluke, L.11; Douglas, L.10;
Crawford Lindsay, 10 merks; Carmichael, 10 merks; Pettinain,
L.5; Carstairs, L.5; Dunsyre, L.5; Roberton, L.5; Wiston,
L.5; Carnwath, L.10.
	Parochial Registers.--A correct parish register has been- kept
for many years, and the session records extend as far back as the
year 1672; in which there is nothing interesting or curious, ex-
cept some severe instances of church discipline, especially during
the ministry of Mr John M'Leran, who was afterward so well
known, and so much esteemed at Edinburgh.

			III.-POPULATION.

	The population of the parish at different periods has been as
follows :


<TABLE>
			In 1755, the population was 845
			   1791,	            924
         1801,              899
         1811,              875
			   1821,	            937
         1831,              981

By this table it appears, that, during the last war, the popula-
tion decreased. It has increased gradually since the peace. The
increase, since 1831, has not been great.
