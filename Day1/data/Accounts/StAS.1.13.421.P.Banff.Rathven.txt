chased from the merchants at pit, at 6 s. 4 d. the boll, 
containing 4 English bushels, and weighing 200 lb.  Eng-
lish.  The duty the boll is 5 s. 6 d.; the freight, and other 
dues, about 1 s. 1 d.; salt therefore slands the importer at 
the rate of 12 s. 11 d. the boll.  To the consumer it is

advantages secured; and the fostering hand of Govern- 
ment stretched out to aid the public to construct harbours, 
build piers, and form quays or wharfs, for lading and un- 
lading vessels, little more would remain to be done in fa- 
vour of the manufactures and fisheries.

heights of Corridown, there was a remarkable one called 
the Core Stanes; the stones of which were employed in 
building the new house of Lettersourie.  Mr Gordon has 
searched 3 of them to the bottom, and found only char- 
coal, and a whitish lost substance, resembling the alhes of 
wood or of bones.  The low grounds in the vicinity of 
his house, he imagines, must have formerly abounded in
