parates this parish from that of Kinglassie, abounds with
trout; and, about Michaelmas, great numbers of eels are
taken in their passage from Lochleven to the sea.  On
this account the lands of Strathendrie in this parish, were,
before the Reformation, subject to an annual tax of some thou-
sands of eels to the abbey of Inchcolm.
   There are in the parish quarries of whin-stone, but very

by the late Earl of Rothes, in 1767.

remarkable instance of which is, that for several years after
1760, the present incumbent got all his wheaten bread from
Edinburgh, and afterwards from Dysart, rolls only being bak-
