yearly.  This arrangement would serve three parishes, and pay back
more than the outlay.
   Ecclesiastical State.-The parish church stands on a tumulus
or mound, on the northern banks of the Medwin, and is quite con-
veniently situate for the inhabitants.  At what time the church
was built is uncertin.  About 1750 it was thatched with heath;
as it then appears to have received for the first time a slate roof.
At the Reformation, it had been built of the barn construction
with the materials of an old Gothic building.  In 1820 it under-
went a complete repair; and a Gothic window.  It is seated
to accommodate betvixt 240 and 250 sitters. The seats are all free.
The heritors divided them amongst their tenants in proportion to
their tenants; and alloted a certain proportion to the village.
   The manse was built in 1756, and was pretty well repaired in
in 1815.  It has now, however, become ruinous, and requires either
to be rebuilt, or very thoroughly repaired.  There is also a defi-
ciency in the accommodation of office-houses.
   The glebe consists of fifteen English acres, exclusive of the
site of the manse, and offices, and garden.  It was subdivided and
enclosed with stone dikes, and hedges, and rows of the trees, by the
present incumbent, and, being well drained, may be worth L. 30
or L. 40 annually.
   The church or living was gifted to the Abbot and Convent of
Kelso, betwixt the yeas 1180 and 1199, by Helias brother to
Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, and held by that Convent from the
twelfth century till the Reformation.  This parish was a rectory
of the monks of Kelso; but the revenue they drew  from thence
till the year 1316, was not above L. 5, 6s. 8d. annually.  At the
Reformation the revenue increased to L. 20.  In 1791-2 the sti-
pend was L. 100, exclusive of manse abd glebe, which last was es-
timated at L. 10 a-year.  IN 1811, when the Legislature augmented
the living below L. 150 to that su, the living of Dunsyre on an
average of the seven previous years war worth L. 114, 17s. 11 9/12 d.
inclusive of L. 8, 6s, 8d. for communion elements.  As the seven
years average was taken when grain was very high, the deficiency
in succeeding years become great; and another act of Parliament
was passed in 1842 to remedy the evil.  Still, however, although a
small addtion was then made, it seldom happens, from the reduced
price of grain, that the stipend rises to L. 150.  It may be worth
while to mention, that the minister was titular of the teinds, and still
