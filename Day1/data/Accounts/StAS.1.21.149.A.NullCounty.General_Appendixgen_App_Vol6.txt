     The Statistical Account.

   But now, ghosts and demons are no longer visible.  The
fye has withdrawn his warning, and the elf his arrows.
Fairies, without requiring compensation, have renounced
their possessions.  The old man's fold is reduced to tillage.
The sagacious old woman; who has survived her friends and
means, is treated with humanity, in spite of the grisly bristles
which adorn her mouth.  And in the minds of the young
cultivated by education, a steady pursuit of the arts of life
has banished,the chimeras of fancy*.  Books, trade, ma-
nufacture, foreign and domestic news, now engross the con-
versation; and the topic of the day is always warmly, if not
ingeniously discussed.  From believing too much, many,
particularly in the higher walks of life, have rushed to
the opposite extreme of believing too little; so that; even
in this remote corner, scepticism may justly boast of her
votaries

*Education has been much attended to in this parish for many years past.
We have, at present, an excellent schoolmaster, who teaches English, Latin,
French, Greek, the mathematics with their practical application: but alas, he
drudges for 100 merks a-year!  The heritors have lately given him a fine
school; and it is to be hoped that men of liberal minds will soon set the pro-
priety of giving him a decent salary.
