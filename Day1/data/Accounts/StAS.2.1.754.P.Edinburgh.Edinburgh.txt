were to be considered as the joint stock of the company, and the
shares to be held in proportion to the capital invested. They
were erected into a body corporate, first by the magistrates, and
afterwards by Parliament. In 1767, their capital having accummu-
lated beyond what was necessary to protect the property of the
shareholders, they resolved to admit no more members on the
original plan; but they continue to insure property on the usual
plan of payment of an annual premium. Since the success of this
company, many others have been established in Edinburgh, a few
of which are here enumerated.

   Union Canal.-The idea of a water communication between
Edinburgh and Glasgow began to be entertained so far back as
1793; and at that time several surveys were made. Some time af-
terwards, the town-council laid these surveys before Mr Ren-
nie of London, and requested his opinion. That celebrated engi-
neer conceiving these surveys objectionable, suggested a new line,
which, be thought, could be executed on one level from Bruntsfield
Links to Hill Head, near Glasgow. In consequence of a want
of unanimity among the parties concerned, nothing farther, how-
ever, was done till the year 1813 when the proprietors of the
Forth and Clyde Canal suggested a collateral cut from that canal
to Edinburgh, on a line surveyed by their architect Mr Baird.
In 1815, Mr Telford approving of this line, the subscribers brought
in a bill into Parliamefit for carrying it into effect; but the bill
being opposed by the magistrates of Edinburgh, was thrown out.
In 1817, after various plans had been discussed at several meet-
ings, that of Mr Baird was finally adopted; and an act of Parlia-
ment was obtained for carrying it into execution. The work was
commenced in the spring of 1818; and was completed and opened
for the passage of boats in May 1822. The canal is five feet deep,
and forty feet wide at the surface, contracting to twenty-two feet
at the bottom. It commences at the Basin, Lothian Road, and
joins the Forth and Clyde Canal at lock sixteen, near the village
of Camelon, extending 31 1/2 miles. There are three large aque-
ducts, a tunnel about half a mile in length, and eleven locks on
