     Of Forglen.

The superstition of fomer times is now much worn
out*.
   This parish, from its situation, is dry, and the air pure
and healthy.  There are no epidemic diseases; fevers oc-
casionally, but not so mortal as in other corners.  They
now see by experience the advantage of medical skill, and
more readily apply to the doctor than formerly in time of
need; and many are now reconciled to inoculation for
the small pox.  They find it as good to let the doctor
prepare them, and do it, as to let the children inoculate
themselves at random.  They live to a good old age.  A
good many are on the borders fo fourscore, healthy and 
vigorous; and severals of late have past 90.

ordinary day in other quarters of the church.  There are also happy and
unhappy feet.  Thus, they wish bridegrooms and brides a happy foot;
and to prevent any bad effect, they salute those they meet on the road
with a kiss.  It is hard, however, if any misfortune happens when you
are passing, that you should be blamed, when neither you nor your feet
ever thought of the matter.  The tongue too must be guarded, even
when it commends; it had more need, one would think, when it dis-
commends.  Thus, to prevent what is called sorespeaking, they say of a
person, God save them; of a beast, Luck fair it.
