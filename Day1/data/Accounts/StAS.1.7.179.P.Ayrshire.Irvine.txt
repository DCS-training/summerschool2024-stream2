time ago burdened his subjects with 1 l. 10 s. annually for
the education of poor children.  Mr Stewarts a druggist
here, has lately disponed his subject, in value about 300 l. to
the poor, reserving to himself and wife (they have no chil-
dren) the liferent of it.  The magistrates and heritors, who
are required every year to attend at settling the treasurer's
accounts are well acquainted with the state of the funds;
and, when necessary, they voluntarily assess themselves in such

dissolved, many young men from that country and the West
Indies were sent here for their education.  Mr Cunningham,
who was then rector, and had always a doctor under him,

character of the school is now, perhaps, as high as ever it

salary is 10 l.  His perquisites arise from testimonials and his
salary as session-clerk.  There are about 30 boys at the gram-
mar school; at the English, about 70 scholars.  At private
hours they teach arithmetic, writing, book-keeping, mathe-
matics, French, geography, etc.  There is a school-mistress
established here, who teaches all kinds of needle-work.

   Ecclesiastical State of the Parish.-There is one minister on-
ly.  He has an assistant, whose salary is 40 l.; 15 l. of which
