                        PAISLEY.                           295

in March 1821.  No sum less than one shilling is received, and no
interest is paid on any sum less than L. 1, 5s.  The deposits are
lodged in the Paisley and Union Banks.  The general superin-
tendence is vested in fifteen trustees, chosen annually at a gene-
ral meeting of the subscribers to the security fund of L. 1000.  A
standing committee of six of these takes the immediate charge.
The cashier is named by the trustees andually, and finds security
for his intromissions at the siglit of the trustees, who meet once a
year for the review of the transactions of the preceding year, and
other business connected with the institution.
   It was considered of high importance, that the institution should
contain within itself the means of its own existence, instead of be-
ing indebted to general eleemosynary aid ; and on application to the
Paisley and Union Banks, the only banks then in the town, they
generously agreed to allow five per centon the money to be deposit-
ed with them, which enabled the directors for some time to pay
to the depositors four per cent. leaving the remaining one per cent.
and interest on fractional sums, applicable to the defraying expen-
ses of management.  The rate of interest has since fluctuated ac-
cording to the money market; but the directors have always been
enabled from the same source to allow depositors the same rate
as was generally allowed by the other banks to their mercantile
customers.  The subjoined statement will shew the yearly pro-
gress of the institution.
   Statement of cash received and paid by the Paisley Provident
Bank, since its commencement on 13th November 1815.
