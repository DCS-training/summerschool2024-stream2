     Statistical Account

   Huntingtower Castle, formerly Ruthven Castle, which
is situated in this parish, may perhaps be entitled to attention,
as the ancient seat of the Ruthven or Gowrie family, so re-
markable for its singular and mysterious catastrophe: But an
event which has been the ground of so much controversy as
that which is known by the name of Gowrie's Conspiracy, is
evidently too great a subject, either for examination or detail

1244 above mentioned.  Upon the authority of tradition, and
some inscriptions of uncertain date, together with the circum-
stance of three mill rynds being still a part of the Mercer's arms,
it is generally believed, by those who have inquired into the sub-
ject, that the corn-mills served by this canal were originally the
property of that family, and granted by them to the king, who,
in return, gave them a burial-place in the church of Perth,
which the family still possesses.  And it we compare these cir-
cumstances with a charter of confirmation granted by David
I. to the Abbey of Dimfermline in the year 1140, (See Sir
James Dalrymple's Collections) we find that the transaction al-
luded to, must have taken place, and consequently that the ca-
nal itself must have existed, prior to the date of this charter:
For the king, therein, either gives away for the first time, or
confirms what his predecessors had done in giving away, the
whole property of the church of Perth to that Abbey, in whose
possession it accordingly remained till the period of the reforma-
tion; and consequently, the royal grant of a burial-place in that
church to the family of Aldie, as a return for their gift of the
mills served by this canal, must have been of earlier date than
the year 1140, from which period the church and its appen-
dages were no longer at the disposal of the kings of Scotland.
If this sort of evidence, then, can warrant us to believe that the
canal in question belonged to the Mercers of Aldie before the
year 1140, there also arises strong presumption of its having
been a work of still earlier execution; for the nature and design
of the work will scarce admit of our believing it to have been
originally executed by the Mercers, or any private family what-
ever, but naturally lead to a supposition of its having been, in
the first instance, a public concern, which, from circumstances
now unknown, had at length come into the hands of a private
family, perhaps only as far as regarded its connection with the
corn-mills.
