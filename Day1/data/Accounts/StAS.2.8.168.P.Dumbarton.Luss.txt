their relief is as follows, on an average for the last seven years:
Collections in Church, L.38, 11s.; mortcloth dues, L.2, 1Os.;
proclamations of banns, L.3, 10s.; amount of seat rents, L.9,
7s. 6d.; interest of stock, L.10, 16s.; donations, &c. L.12; to-
tal of contributions for poor, L.76, 4s. 6d. There is no disposi-
tion among the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief.
They do not now appear to consider it so degrading as formerly.
  Fairs.--There is one fair held within this parish, in the village
of Luss, on the third Tuesday of August, for the sale of sheep and
lambs.
  Inns.--At Luss there is a large inn. There are, besides, six
licensed public-houses within the parish. Their effect on the
morals of the people, is decidedly unfavourable. Three may be
considered as sufficient for all useful purposes.
