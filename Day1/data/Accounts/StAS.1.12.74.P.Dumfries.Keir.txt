terspersed with bent, and other kinds of grass, neither very
coarse nor very fine, but generally allowed to be very good
sheep-pasture.  There arer no rivers in the parish, except those
already mentioned, which run along the N. and S. E. side of
it.  Into these, several little rivulets, or, as they are common-
ly called, burns, from the high or hilly ground, empty them-
selves.

   Woods and Plantations.-There is a considerable extent of
natural wood in different parts of the parish, consisting chiefly
of oak and ash, with some birch and alder.  In the woods up-
on the estate of Barjarg, is an oak tree remarkable for its great
size and age.  At the root, it is about 14 1/2 feet in circumfe-
rence, and it loses very little of its thickness at the height of
30 feet.  Its age cannot now be ascertained, but it must cer-
tainly be several hundred years old.  The highest branches
seem now to be beginning to decay.  There are also some
plantations, consisting mostly of fir.  These plantations, toge-
ther with the natural woods, add much to the beauty of the
place, and in stormy weather afford shelter to the cattle graz-
ing in them, and in the adjoining fields.

   Climate and Diseases.-The climate is rather moist and damp,
owing to the continued ridge of hills, on the S. side of the pa-
rish, intercepting and breaking the clouds into rain, which
is poured down on the sides of the hills, and those places that
are near them, much more frequently, and more plentifully,
than on the plain and level grounds at a greater distance from
them.  To this cause, perhaps, are to be ascribed the flow
nervous fevers, rheumatisms, and asthmatic disorders, which
seem to be more prevalent here, than any other diseases.
