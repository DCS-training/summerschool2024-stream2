     of Kilmadock or Doune.

   The castle is a huge square building, the walls being 40
feet high, and about 10 feet thick.  The tower is erec-
ted on the north-east corner, and what remains of it is about
80 feet in height; but its massy thickness detracts very
much from its appearing lofty.  The north-west corner of
the castle has been the family residence.  The strong wall
mentioned above incloses a spacious square, each side where-
of is 96 feet.  The great gate stands on the north, and the
iron gate and bars still remain entire.  There are several
cellars and prisons on the ground floor, on each side of the
entry; and, after being introduced into the great area, you
ascend to the tower and family-house by two outside stairs,
standing over against each other, that appear to have been
once shaded by a roof supported with stone pillars, which are
now in ruins.
   The wester stair leads up to a spacious lobby, that divides
the kitchen from the great hall.  This hall is 63 feet long,
and 25 feet wide, and the roof has been covered with stone
or slate, but nothing now remains except the walls.  The
kitchen chimney extends from the one side of the room to
the other, being supported by a strong arch still entire; and
the whole building, on this side, has the remains of grandeur
and magnificence.
   The easter stair leads up to the apartments in the tower.
The first is a spacious room, with a pend roof, and a large
chimney, containing a middle pillar.  This room commu-
nicates with the great hall at the north-west corner, and was
perhaps the family dining-room.  There are several other
apartments in the upper stories:  but the grandeur of this
edifice is completely effaced by those terrible prisons it con-
tains.
   From the south-east corner of the dining-room above
mentioned, a narrow stone stair descends, and leads, by a
subterraneous passage, into a cell or dungeon, that lies below
