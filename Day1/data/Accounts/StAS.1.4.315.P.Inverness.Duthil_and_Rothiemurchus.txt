prejudice so universal and deeply rooted, will require
strong and uncommon exertions.  The efforts of a native
have hitherto had so little effect, that they only serve to
verify, 'That a prophet has no honour in his own coun-
'try.'  The only effectual mode would be, by one or more
strangers of experience settling in such districts, as a necessi-
ty of this kind requires.  Though proprietors, for a num-
ber of years, should give the highest encouragement, the
advantage in time would be immense.-Until the late, the
people were very fond of a military life; but the wages of
servants increasing so exceedingly, that spirit is almost to-
tally overcome.  Formerly none would inlist but in the
Highland corps.  Bounty-money now determines the
choice.  The people are sufficiently economical, yet ex-
tremely hospitable and well disposed.  They enjoy the
comforts and advantages of society, as much as an inland
country, and a severe climate, will admit of.-The situation
of the parish in 1782 and 1783 was truly distressing.
Had it not been for Government bounty, and Sir James
Grant's large supplies from distant countries, the poorer
class of people would have perished.  So great was the de-
struction of the crop in 1782, by the frost setting in so ear-
ly as the month of August, that the most substantial corn
which was sent to home of the mills in this parish, was a
crop of wild oats from a piece of ground which had been
ploughed, but not sown.  From various observations made
upon this kind of grain, it appears to be a spontaneous pro-
duction; so that should oats, by some calamity, be sweeped
off from the face of the earth, it might be regained by a
proper cultivation of this species of grain, offensive as it is.
It will naturally occur to those unacquainted with a severe
climate, that early sowing would, in some degree, prevent
the fatal effects of frost.  This may answer in a favourable
