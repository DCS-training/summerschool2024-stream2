which appear to luxuriate in the open air during the winter,
and which may be called exotic kinds to most parts of Scotland.
The Arbutus ripens its scarlet berries in several places; in well-
kept pleasure grounds the myrtle is frequently seen in blossom in
the months of December and January; and Fuscias not only sur-
vive the winter in the open air, but may be seen, where special
attention has been paid to that beautiful deciduous shrub, reared
into a hedge or garden fence. In the more elevated parts of the
parish, indeed, along the hilly and mountainous ranges described,
snow generally makes its appearance early in winter, and is fre-
quently sden to continue for several Months.
  Meteorology.-A very regular and accurate register of meteoro-
logical observations has been kept at Castle Toward for twenty
years past by the late Kirkman Finlay Esq., and is still continued
by the present proprietor, Alexander S. Finlay, Esq. The situa-
tion where the thermometer, barometer, and rain-gauges are placed,
is about 120 feet above the level of the sea, and at the distance of
about half a mile to the north, the hill of Buachaill-ithean rises to
the height of 1100 feet above that level. A table of the general
monthly results for the last three years preceding 1843 is here
introduced. *

<FOOTNOTE>It may be observed with respect to this table, that the situation of Castle Toward,-
facing the S.W. W. and N. W., with a very large ar.-d open expanse around in these
several directions, may in some measure tend to produce results more equable than
ight be found by similar observations in any other locality of the united parish.
The rain-gauge chiefly used is one of very simple construction by Mr Thom of Ascog,
in But.. Mr Finlay, however, to ensure the greater accuracy, employed gauges of
different constructions, coniparidg the results. His superintendence or this register
