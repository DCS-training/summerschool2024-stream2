retail business, the largest of the kind in the King's dominions
out of London, contains 30,003 square feet of flooring. In these
premises the public are supplied with nearly every description of
goods of woollen, linen, cotton, and silk manufacture, and the ar-
rangements are such that purchasers of the smallest quantities for
private use are equally attended to and accommodated with those
who make the most extensive purchases, for either home or foreign
consumpt. Upwards of eighty persons are employed in the sale-
departments of these warehouses, and the following is a note of
the respective amounts of six years sales, which not only shows
the progressive increase of the Messrs Campbells' business, but
exhibits a fair criterion of the rapid increase, and commercial im-
provement of the city of Glasgow.

2000 people. It may likewise be remarked, that, although se-
veral London houses turn a greater sum annually, in consequence
of dealing largely in the more valuable descriptions of silk goods,
it is understood that the Messrs Campbell serve as great a num-
ber of customers as any of those highly respectable metropolitan
establishments.
	The Tea Trade.--The Camden was the first vessel unconnect-
ed with the East India Company which brought a cargo of tea
direct from Canton to Brittain. She was consigned by China mer-
chants to Mr William Mathieson of Glasgow, and her full cargo of
Bohea, Congou, Cape Congou, Campio, and Souchong, was sold

	Literature.--From the commercial enterprise which engages
the time and attention of its inhabitants, this city cannot boast of
a literary character. There are many individuals, however, of
