dale; and on the N. and N. W. by the parish of Portree.
The middle of the parish is flat, but the greater part hilly.
The hills on the north side of the parish are of a conical
form, and very high.  Such as have ascended their tops
are of opinion, that volcanic eruptions have once taken
place here, as the rubbish which is to be met with along
their sides and at their bottom is not unlike lava.  The hills
that lie in the other districts of the parish are covered with
heath.  The soil is various; in some parts clay, in some
places a black loam, but by far the greater part mossy.
There is great abundance of limestone; some marble, but
of an inferior kind, and too porous to admit of a fine po-
lish.  There is likewise a very good quarry of freestone,
chiefly of a light blue colour.  In the small island of Pabba
there is the appearance of iron ore.  Marl in abundance is
found here in different places.  The air is most and foggy:
More rain falls in this parish than in any other part of Sky.
The most prevalent distempers are rheumatisms, colds, and
nervous fevers.

   Fish, Kelp, Harbours, Islands, etc.-The fish caught on
the coast are cod, ling, mackrel, scate, flounder, lythe, fye,
coddies, and herring, but very few of these are exported.
The herring for a few years back have not frequented the
lochs of this parish in such quantities as formerly, nor have
they staid so long-About 100 tons of kelp are made here
annually, which, four years ago, sold for L. 6 per ton; but
for these three last years, has fallen to L. 4, and even to
L. 3, 10 s.  The two small islands of Pabba and Scalpa
constitute a part of this parish; they lie to the east of it,
and are distant about two thirds of a mile.  The former is
only a wintering place for cattle, of which it may support
from 70 to 80 for half a year.  The latter is 3 miles in
