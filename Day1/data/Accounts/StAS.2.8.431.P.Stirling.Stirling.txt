   stones.

  No estimate is here made of the business done in the numerous
markets for horses, &c.; or by the steam-boats, the gas com-
pany, brewers, innkeepers, builders, joiners, plumbers, and other
mechanics.
  Since 1832, the woollen manufacture has more than doubled.
That of cotton has fallen off, and is now inconsiderable. Coach-
building has much increased.  There are three mills for spinning
wool.  In these, tbere are 140 hands employed.  They work six
days of the week; during five of which, they work eleven hours,
and on Saturday nine.  There are not less than 280 looms em-
ployed by Stirling manufacturers in the weaving of wool into tartan
pieces, shawls, &c. there being now little carpet weaving.  They
give employment to about 650 weavers, winders, &c.  The days
and hours of work with weavers are six days in the week, and
fourteen hours in the day.  There are employed in dyeing
about 28; in tanning and skinning about 12 persons ; in coach-
making, about 100; and in ropemaking, 20.  In the four last-
named, the hours of working are ten in the day.  There may be
ninety of the hands employed in connection with the weaving of
woollen goods, residing beyond the parish.  But, on the other
band, one or two manufacturers residing out of the parish, employ
weavers in it; which, along with the few looms employed here by
cotton-manufacturers in Glasgow, will, it is estimated, fully com-
pensate for that circumstance.  So that the whole number of per-
sons within the parish employed in all the branches of manufac-
ture carried on in Stirling, may be about 949.  In all these
branches, there is a fair remuneration to those engaged in them,
The occupation of wool-spinning has an excellent effect on health;
and the regular employment, and the attention paid by the mas-
ters, appear to have a good effect on the morals of those employed.
