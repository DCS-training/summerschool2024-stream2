boundary of this parish, and abounds with salmon, trout,
and pike.  Its course is here all along skirted with woods,

caught in the Tay here, at an average, weigh 20 l b:  Ila
salmon only 10 l b.  It is reckoned that the size of salmon
bears a proportion to the size of the rivers in which they
are bred.  The fisheries of this parish are of considerable 
value, and are mostly all held in lease by a Company in 
Perth, who preserve the salmon in ice, and send them fresh
