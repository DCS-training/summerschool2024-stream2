bout, and they certainly could be done with no great expence
to government, the business of this place would reap from
them evident advantages.
   But this inconveniency of the want of quick and regular
returns of the post, is trifling compared to those the inhabi-
tants sustain from the want of regular markets.  The Main-
land is situated almost in the middle of the islands, which
extend from north-east to south-west upwards of 70 miles.
Kirkwall stands near the center of the Mainland, or principal
island, which stretches from north to south, in some parts 7
or 8 miles, and from east to west about 30.  Thus situated
in the heart of the whole country, which is abundantly fer-
tile in all the ordinary kinds of provisions, one would natu-
rally imagine, the inhabitants could be in no want of any of
the articles of living.  But this is really not the care; for if
we except beef, which can be purchased in the market from
harvest till some time in the end of winter, they are much at
a loss to procure any sort of provisions.  If they wish to have
beef, either in spring or summer, they are under the disagree-
able necessity of sending to purchase it in different parts of
the country.  In the same way when they stand in need of
malt or meal, of mutton, pork, poultry, or fish, as they can-
not have them at home, they must send for them from the
Mainland, or from the islands at a distance.  Numerous are
the hardships to which the want of markets exposes the in-
habitants of almost every description.  Men of landed pro-
perty, indeed, feel these much less than others; for such ar-
ticles as they are in need of, and as the country produces,
are furnished in abundance to their families from their e-
states by an agreement with their tenants.  But such as have
no estates, and especially poor tradesmen and labourers, are
often even with money in their pockets, at a loss to subsist
