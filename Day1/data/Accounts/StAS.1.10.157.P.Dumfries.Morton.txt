<FOOTNOTE>

*The increase of population has been occasioned by the di-
vision of farms, the liming of land, the making of roads, and
the additional employment for labourers which these and other
improvements have afforded.

+The Antiburghers have a place of worship in Thornhill,
where their minister, who resides at Minnyhive, preaches every
second Sunday.
