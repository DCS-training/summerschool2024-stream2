   Nursery and Commerce.-In this parish there is a considerable
nursery carried on by the Messrs.  Dicksons.  This nursery was
first established at Hassendean Burn, in a neighbouring parish,
in the year 1729.  The ground there, fit for the purpose, be-
ing all occupied, in 1766 they feued land in Hawick, amount-
ing to 36 acres, to extend their business.  There two nurseries
contain all kinds of fruit and forest trees, flower plants, and
roots, and flowering shrubs, that are naturalized to this coun-
try; besides a great collection of exotic plants.  The demand
for these articles of nursery is considerable; for, besides supplying
all the adjoining country, and several other parts of Scotland,
they are sent to many places of Northumberland, Cumberland,
Westmoreland, North Wales, Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire,
etc.  At some seasons, there are 50 people employed in the
nursery grounds; but, at an average, 30 are employed the
whole season.-Some people here make it their employment,
to buy up eggs in the neighbouring counties, and carry them
to Berwick, taking some weeks to the amount of 1501 L., and, at
an average, of 50 L. per week through the year.  Others are
entirely occupied in collecting sheep skins, both white and tar-
red, in Dumfries-shire, Tweeddale and Selkirkshire.  Part of
them are manufactured in Hawick, and the rest sold in quanti-
ties to the skinners in Kelso and Galashiels.  The persons,
who collect the skins, through the sheep countries, likewise
buy up coarse linen yarn; which, together with what is made
in Hawick and its neighbourhood, (not used in our manufac-
tures), is sent to Kendal, Glasgow, Stirling, Leith and Aber-
deen.  One person gets about 200 packs of wool spun into
yarn, which he sells at these markets.

   Church and Poor.-The Duke of Buccleugh is patron of
the parish.  The living consists of 911, 13 s. 4 1/2 d., 16 bolls
meal, 20 bolls barley, the vicarage tythes of a small part of
