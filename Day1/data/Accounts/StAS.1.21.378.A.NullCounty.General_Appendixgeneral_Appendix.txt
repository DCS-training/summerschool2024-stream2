     General Appendix to

are totally unemployed in this parish and district.  The par-
ish contains 370 families, which, including men, women,
grown boys and girls, may be calculated at 4 to a family,
which makes at present 1480 hands, who only barely pro-
cure themselves a subsistence, and are utterly useless to the
public.  The whole district is equally well inhabited, and
equally idle, except about Drimkeerin.
   15th query.  I hear of only 2 families emigrated to Ame-
rica last season, and never any before; but by the eager en-
quiries of the people about their success, I imagine, the spirit
of emigration might quickly seize them.
   16th query.  Perhaps this kingdom could not furnish an-
other district, which could afford so much satisfaction, in re-
spect to your 16 th query, as this; to which, however, from
my want of skill in many of these matters, I am disqualified
to afford you the satisfaction I could wish.  However, I can
inform you, that throughout the whole district, a vein of ve-
ry fine coal shews itself; but none is worked at present, ex-
cept Mr Jones's, and that so badly, that if any water, be it
ever so little, comes on the workmen, they are obliged to
desist, not having even a common pump to rid themselves of
any part.
   The variety of strong sulphur spas, &c. scattered through
the district, perhaps indicate a variety of minerals, which I
want skill to ascertain; and no place in this kingdom, affords
so great quantity of iron ore; nor is there perhaps a place in
Europe where iron could be made to more advantage, if the
method of running the same, with pit-coal, instead of char-
coal, could be thoughly practised.
   Here also is the greater variety of fine potters earth, and
inexhaustible quarries of flint lie at the distance of 5 miles
from Ballytra Bridge.  This has made me often think, with
What superior advantage a pottery might be established here,
