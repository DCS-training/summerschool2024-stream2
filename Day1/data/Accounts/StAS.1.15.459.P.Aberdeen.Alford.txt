but as that obstacle is now removed by the erection of a lint
mill in the neighbourhood by Mr Leith of Whitehaugh, the
culture of this plant is becoming much more general and ex-
tensive.
   Field turnips and sown grasses, with ordinary attention, have
answered remarkably well in this country; and as the farmers
are convinced, by small trials, of the benefits which attend
that mode of husbandry, they are more desirous than for-
merly of improving in that way, though it is still no easy talk
to persuade them to abandon their old habits and prejudices.
   The number of black cattle in this parish (in December
1793, when the year's sale is over) is 953 Of these 346 are
oxen for the plough, of which there are 65 in the parish, al-
most all of the old Scotch construction.  Every farmer is am-
bitious of having many pairs of oxen in his plough; some have
6, many have 5, and few common farmers, with any extent
of possession, have less than 4 pairs.  Smaller tenants yoke
oxen, horses, and even bulls, cows, and young cattle, promis-
cuously, to make up what they deem a sufficient strength.  No
difference in the nature of the soil is attended to in propor-
tioning the strength and number of the cattle; for a farmer,
who yokes 10 or 12 oxen, employs them all, whether he plow
his in-field land, or the most rugged stony out-field.  Neither
does this make any great difference in the quantity of land
ploughed at a yoking, which is from 1/4 to 1/3 of an acre*, and
which corresponds with the poor seeding of the cattle.  Ox-
en, which fold 40 years ago at 2 L. or 3 L. sell now from 5 L. to
7 L. and those of the best kind and size among common far-
mers, will even rise to 8 L. and 9 L.  Every farmer sells one or
two pairs of oxen yearly, and replaces them by others of his
own rearing.

*The country people compute land by the quantity sown with a boll of
seed; which may be very little more, if any thing, than a Scots acre.
