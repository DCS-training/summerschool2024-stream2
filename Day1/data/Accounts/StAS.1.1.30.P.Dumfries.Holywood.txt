tends to retard the cultivation and improvement of the
district.

   Mede of Cultivation.-There are 70 ploughs in the parish.
Those used in the first division, fee p. 20. and the greatest part
of the second, viz. the light soil, are the small English
plough; in part of the second, and adjoining part of the third,
they use the Scots plough with the English mould-board,
or ploughs composed partly on the model of the old Scots,
and partly on that of the English; and in the remaining part
of the third, the Scots plough only is used.  Each of these
ploughs seems well adapted for the nature of the soil in the
district where they are used.  The English plough is cer-
tainly the best, but it can only work properly in land that
is free from stones.  The Scots plough, when properly made,
is doubtless the fittest for strong land; and, lastly, the plough
composed of the two, is the most proper for land that is
composed of the two kinds above mentioned; and these are
the nature of the different soils in which the several kinds of
ploughs are used.  The ploughs are commonly drawn by two
strong horses, and one man both holds the plough and drives
the horses, with a pair of long reins.  When stiff land is to
be broken up from grass, three, or sometimes four horses are
yoked into a plough of the same construction, but of a strong-
er make.

   Produce.-The vegetable produce of this parish has already
been specified, under the article, Division of Land.  With re-
spect to animal productions, it is principally distinguished for a
breed of black cattle, for which the country of Dumfries in
