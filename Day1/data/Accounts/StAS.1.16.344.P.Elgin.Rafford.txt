     Statistical Account

family seat belonging to the Dunbars, is mostly demolish-
ed; all that remains of it being a high tower, which, stand-
ing on elevated ground, commands an immense prospect,
including almost the whole Moray Frith, with a great part
of the counties of Elgin, Nairn, Inverness, Cromarty, Ross,
Sutherland and Caithness.

   Eastward from this about two miles, stands the castle of
Burgee, the seat of Dunbar of Grange.  It is a large and
beautiful fabric, consisting of a square tower of six storeys,
built in 1602, and an adjoining mansion founded about a
century later.  The gardens occupy several acres, contain
a variety of fruit-trees, and are skirted with double rows
of fine spreading beeches.  In approaching this place,
which is very conspicuous, the mind is powerfully im-
pressed with an idea of ancient magnificence.  Here is the
freestone quarry alluded to page 340. from which, though
great quantities of materials are constantly taken, the pro-
prietor derives almost no pecuniary advantage.  It is fur-
ther remarkable, that though Mr Dunbar's rental has su-
stained little or no alteration for more than 80 years;
though the whole of his lands are very improvable, and
abound with every needful accommodation; yet his peo-
ple are not affluent, their farms are poorly cultivated, and
their houses mean.  These defects must doubtless in some
measure be attributed to want of leases, which, on account
of certain family embarrassments, that gentlemen is not
disposed to grant them.  Being restricted, too, from cut-
ting peat in the mosses of Burgie, they consume a great
part of the summer in providing their fuel, which they
must bring from the mosses of Altyre in the opposite ex-
tremity of the parish, where Grange has a servitude.  This
inconvenience still further aggravates the want of agricul-
tural improvement in his estate.
