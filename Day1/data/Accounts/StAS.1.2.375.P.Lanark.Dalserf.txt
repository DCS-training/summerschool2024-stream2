wind, is from the south-west and west:  When it blows from
the south, it is often accompanied with heavy showers.  In
the spring, cold sharp winds frequently blow from the east and
north; and then there is generally a strong drought; but
when rain sets in with an east wind, it is heavy, and of long
continuance.  The driest weather is mostly in the months of
May and June, which is very injurious to the crops on the
rigid clay, after it has been soaked and battered by the win-
ter's rains.  When the summer's rains are late in falling, which
frequently happens, the clay grounds, prepared by the sun and
drought to receive them, then pushes up the languishing crops
with great luxuriance, and this occasions a late harvest.-
When the spring is dry and favourable, oats, pease, and beans,
are sown in March; but the clay soil and close bottom being
very retentive of moisture, and the springs often showery.  A
pril is sometimes far advanced, before the land is fit for the re-
ception of these seeds.  Barley is generally sown about the
middle of May.

   Cattle.-The horses, kept for cultivating the land, are up-
wards of 130 in number; besides young ones annually reared,
which may be about 25.  There are also 10 horses kept by
carters, who are employed in carrying coals, and other com-
modities, to and from different places.  The number of milch
cows kept, is about 300, and the young ones annually reared,
probably above 60 at an average.  Some black cattle are al-
ways fed for slaughter on the best inclosed pastures; but the a-
verage number cannot be well ascertained.-There are now
but few sheep kept in the parish, owing to the introduction of
inclosing with hedge and ditch, which obliged the farmers to
dismiss the little flocks, of which every one was formerly pos-
sessed.
