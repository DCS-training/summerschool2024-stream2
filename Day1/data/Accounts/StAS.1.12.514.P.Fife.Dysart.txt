on importing the foreign articles, render it of importance;
and it must be considered as a valuable acquisition to com-
merce.  It is but justice to say, that the improvements in
this art, have kept pace with the other improvements of the
country.  It is thought a boat-builder might find encourage-
ment here.

   Nails.-In Pathhead there are 43 smiths, who make about
6 million of nails annually, value about 1000 L.  They are
sold in the country round, and considerable quantities carried
to Edinburgh, and some to the north country.  In Galaton
there are also 43 smiths, they do not make the same number
of nails, as several of them are far advanced in life, and a
number of them make nails of a larger size for ship-building.
The value of their manufacture, also about 1000 L.  Their
nails are sold in the neighbourhood, and quantities carried to
Perth, Montrose, and Aberdeen.  The nails are made of old
iron imported from Holland:  and the merchants who furnish
the smiths with old iron, take their nails and send them to
market.

   Salt.-Salt was made here, at least some time before 1483,
as appears by an agreement with the family of St. Clair, of
that date.  The works were more extensive than at present.
There are vestiges of many salt-pans; which have been de-
molished long ago.  Much salt was exported to Holland; but
none of late years.  Seven pans are now going, and employ
14 salters, besides 2 or 3 other hands occasionally to carry
the salt to the granaries.  About 17,100 bushels are made an-
nually, value 1200 L.  The fuel employed is chiefly culm.
120 loads are required to make 100 bushels of salt.  The
bittern has been sometimes sought after by the chymists; but
is generally allowed to go to waste.
