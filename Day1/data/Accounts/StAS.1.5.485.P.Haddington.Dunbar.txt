pregnable.  In some old records, it is called Earl Patrick's
Strong House.  It was always esteemed a place of import-
ance, and the key to Scotland on the S. E. border.  Dun-
bar was, for many years, during the cruel wars between
the two nations, the scene of much action and bloodshed.
The town was frequently ravaged and burnt.  The castle was
often besieged, and sometimes bravely desended; particu-
larly anno 1336, when under the government of a lady,
called, Black Agnes of Dunbar, the wife of Patrick Earl
of March, and the sister of Randolpb Earl of Murray.
This manly heroine, in the absence of her husband, by her
vigilance and military courage, forced Lord Montagne to
raise the siege, and leave the country.  To this castle, Earl
Bothwell sled, and left the unfortunate Queen Mary in the
hands of the associated Lords at Carberryhill.  It was ta-
ken afterwards from Bothwell's dependents, by the Earl
of Murray, the Regent of Scotland, and demolished, and
the artillery was carried to Edinburgh, by order of the
Parliament.
   Within the parish of Dunbar, lies a part of Down Hill,
famous for the encampment of General Leslie, with the
Scotch army, before their defeat at the battle of Dunbar.
This battle was sought in the low grounds, E. from Brox-
mouth.  At Broxmouth, there is a mount of earth, which
still retains the name of Cromwells Mount.  At the church
yard, there is an elegant monument, with a fine marble
statue, erected anno 1610, to the memory of George, the
last Earl of Dunbar, and Lord High Treasurer of Scotland.
In the church yard, there are two grave-stones, marking
out the burial place of two officers of the castle; they are
nicely cut, with Latin inscriptions in Saxon characters;
the date of the one in MCCCL. and of the other MCCCLI.
