        portance which the city must have had in ancient times.  It was a
        walled city, but the period wb-en it became so is unknown.
           After the battle of Falkirk in 1298, Edward I. of England
        having reduced all the fortresses in Scotland, strongly fortified
        Perth, and repeatedly made it the residence nf his deputies.  For
        some time, his son Edward, who succeeded him, resided in the
        city.  He was succeeded by Sir Aymer de Vallence, who defeat-
        ed Robert Bruce at Methven 1306. In 1306. King Robert
        stormed the town, which was fortified by an English garrison.
        At the bead of a chosen band he waded through the deep water
        in the moat, and was the second man who mounted the wall.
        He put the garrison to the sword, razed the walls and filled up
        the moat.  In 1335, Edward III. strongly fortified it, laid the ex-
        pense on six rich abbacies, * and appointed Sir Thomas Ochtred,
        Governor.  In 1339, Robert the Lord High Steward, who was
        afterwards raised to the throne, laid siege to it. The  siege
        continued for four months.  By means of mines, the water in the
        moat was drained off, and the place becoming untenable, the Go-
        vernor surrendered.  In 1443, it was besieged and taken by Sir
        William Wallace.  In 1644, after the battle of Tippermore, it was
        taken possession of by the Marquis of Montrose.  In 1651,
        Cromwell, when about to besiege it, proposed hotiourable terms,
        and gained possession of it; and to overawe its inhabitants, built
        a strong citadel on the South Inch.  In 1715, the Earl of Marr,
        and the rebels took refuge in it, after the battle of Dunblane. and
        kept possession till they were dislodged by the Duke of Argyle.
        In 1745, the rebels again obtained possession of it, and attempt-
        ed to repair the fortifications, but the government forces followed
        them, and compelled them to retreat.
           In 1769, Sir David Dalrymple published Historical Memo-
        rials, concerning the provincial councils of the Scottish clergy,
        from the earliest accounts to the era of the Reformation." From
        these memorials it appears that they were held in Edinburgh,
        Perth, Dundee, St Andrews, Linlithgow, Scone Roxburgh, Car-
        lisle, Northampton, and York, to the number of 37.  Of this
        number sixteen were held in Perth, in 1201, 1206, 1211, 1221,
        1242, 1269, 1275, 1280, 1321, 1420, 1428, 1436, 1450, 1457,
