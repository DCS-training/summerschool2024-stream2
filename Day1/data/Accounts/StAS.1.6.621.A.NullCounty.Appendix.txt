   SIR,

I SHALL now, according to my promise, give you an account
of the physical phenomena, that I have noted for some
years. The knowledge of facts is the only foundation of
true philosophy, and without this knowledge, theories and
systems are vague and unsatisfactory.

  It is obvious that this globe which we inhabit has undergone
great and astonishing changes. It is certain that most of the land
we now occupy has once been covered by the sea, for many
of the highest mountains are replete with marine productions.
  That many of the rocks and mountains which we see, must
have been ocasioned by subterraneous fire, no person can doubt.
For instance, the basaltic columns of the Giants causeway, the
island of Staffa, the rocks at the harbour of Dunbar, the hills
of Arthur's Seat and Craiglockhart *, and many others, too
tedious to mention. These are only named as being more im-
mediately under observation.
  Nothing can account for the regular form which the parts of
these rocks have taken, but their being produced by fire,
and this is supported by experiment. It has lately been found
that when similar substances are brought into fusion, and al-
lowed to cool gradually, they assume the same regular shape as
these columns of rock. Some time ago, a furnace of flint glass
