always, however, a great proportion of the lands in grass; and
as the fields are generally laid down in good order, they not on-

could derive from the scanty produce of a constant succession
of corn crops, but also amply repay him for the rest he gives
them, by the luxuriant crops which they yield when taken up,

leases, the lands are not only kept clean, and freed from those
noxious weeds, which are so prejudicial to the grain sown, or
the plants raised on them, but are also prevented from being
impoverished by over-cropping.

their spawn.  Till of late years, great havock used to be made
among them at that season, by the country people; but since

fishings on the Tweed.  On the estate of Edington, besides a
mill for other kinds of grain, there are two mills for grind-

into flour.

   Coast, and Sea Fish.-On the coast, which, towards the East
of the parish, is very bold and rocky, there are abundance of
