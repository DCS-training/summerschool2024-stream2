known to be 130 or 140 years old. They are nearly all red-wood,
and the quality equal to any Baltic or Highland fir. This and
other similar facts show that the Scots fir does not attain its valu-
able qualities till nearly a century at least. There are nearly 150
acres more of younger plantations, planted chiefly by the late Dr
Rogerson, and his son the present proprietor, and also by smaller
proprietors. These are chiefly larch, which are found so much
more profitable at an early age. Among these, are planted firs
grown from seed brought by Dr Rogerson from his estates in Po-
land,--the same as the Riga and Mdmel timber imported to Britain.
It is singular enough that these plants, almost exactly similar to
our Scots fir, have never thriven in any situation; and these,
planted about 15 or 16 years ago, though still alive, are puny, and
evidently want strength and vigour. There are 50 or 60 acres
of oak and ash of natural growth, chiefly along the banks of the
water and burns, which thrive very well.
	There are also about 1200 acres of arable land along the Annan
and Wamphray Water, which produce crops of wheat, barley, and
every sort of green crop, lying from 200 to 300 feet above sea
level.
	Rent of Land.--The average rent of the acres last referred to
is about 22s. per imperial acre; the remainder of the amble land,
lying higher out, and which is here of inferior quality, may be ge-
nerally rented at 10s. or 12s. per acre. The common leases are
fifteen years; a few are nineteen. The farm-buildings and enclo-
sures are good. The rental of the parish is about L. 4000 Sterling.
	Rate of Wages.--Men-servants get from five to six guineas, a few
L. 7, per half year; maid-servants from L. 2, 5s. to L. 3 per half
year, with victuals. Common labourers have 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. in
summer, and 1s. 2d. in winter, per day; masons, carpenters, and
slaters have each 2s. 6d. in summer, and about 2s. in winter, per
day, without victuals.
	Produce.--The average amount and value of gross produce yearly
raised in the parish may be as follows:
