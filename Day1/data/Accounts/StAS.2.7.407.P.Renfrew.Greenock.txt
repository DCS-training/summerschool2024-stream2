     having our eyes feasted with some portion of the rich and magni-
     ficent scenery which is produced by the combination of nature and
     art; of the beath-clad mountains with the grassy bill and culti-
     vated field, and extensive pleasure-ground, and. of the broad ex-
     panse of water with the multitude of the whitening sails which be-
     deck its surface.  From the rising ground the views are peculiarly
     splendid, including in their range the opposite coast from Bowling
     and Dunglass to Dunoon, with its towns, villas, and numerous in-
     dentations, and a considerable part of the south bank of the river,
     with the towns and barbours of Port-Glasgow `nd Greenock.
