   Tenpence or 1 s. with meat, is the ordinary wages from a
day-labourer in husbandry, whether male or female.  1 s, is
the usual wages during harvest.  A male-servant in hus-
bandry, besides board, receives L. 10 or L. 12 per year; a
female, between L. 4 and L. 5.  Few carpenters, masons,
etc. regularly labour in this parish.  A tailor works for
10 d. a-day, with meat.  The people are in general very
industrious.  There are a few weavers, some of whom are
employed in the Osnaburgh trade; but the generality in
what is called country work, for the use of families.  There 
has been a great alteration in dress within the last twenty
years.  It is now far more expensive than formerly.  A
great many articles of dress are brought, which people used
to manufacture for themselves.
   The fuel used in the higher parts of the parish consists of
peat and turf; in the lower, of coals, furze, and broom.
The greatest disadvantage under which this parish labours,
the lower part of it at least, is the want of fuel.  Coals must
be brought from Montrose or Arbroath, both about twenty
miles distant.
   The roads are greatly improved of late.  This year,
L. 105 have been expended in making and repairing pri-
vate roads, leading to the turnpike-road newly formed be-
tween Forfar and Brechin, part of which lies in this parish.
The general opinion is in favour of the turnpike-roads.
   The prices of provision correspond to those of the neigh-
bouring parishes.  Butter, this year, (1796), sells at 1 s. per
lb.  The price of cheese is from 5 s. to 6 s. 8 d. per stone,
according to the quality.
   The broad Scotch is the only language spoken here.  Some
of the names of places are Gaelic, and others of Gothic
origin; although the former seems to abound most.  To
this class the following evidently belong:  Coul, Memus, or
Memis, Ogil, Kinaltie, Balduckie, Balgillo, Quiech, Cairn,
