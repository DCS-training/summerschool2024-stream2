not refuse to grant licenses to toll-bar-keepers, two of whom in
this parish sell ardent spirits.
	Fuel.--This parish is most abundantly supplied with coal and
peat, which are procured at a very small expense; a single horse
load of coal costs from 4s. to 4s. 6d., and one of peat from 8d. to
1s. according to the distance.

			MISCIELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
	The crops in this parish are generally cut down with the sickle,
except on the farm of Woodhouselees. Mr Bell for many years
has used the scythe; and, from experience, has found that there is
a great saving of expense, grain, and fodder. Mr Bell states, that
two mowers, with one person to collect the sheaves to each, and a
man to bind and stook, will do more work than twice the number
with the sickle. This practice is gaining ground.
	In 1793, the rental of this parish did not much exceed L. 3000,
now it is L. 7462, 10s.
	The Duke has erected at his own expense kilns for making
draining tiles, which he supplies to the tenants on their paying a
per centage on the outlay. The Eskdale and Liddesdale Pasto-
ral Society, which has its shows of stock for premiums, alternately
at Langholm and Castletown, has been productive of the best ef-
fect in improving the breed of every description of farm stock.

	February 1836.
