   There are five or six elementary schools, chiefly taught by fe-
males on their own adventure.  The people seem, in general, to
be alive to the benefits of education; and there is s carcely one in
the parish between six and fifteen years of age who cannot read.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-There are on the regular roll
about 70 paupers, several of whom are widows with families, and
they receive each on an average about 1s. a week.  The collec-
tions at the church amount to about L.52.  The beritors for the
last four years. have given yearly L.60, in proportion to their va-
lued rent, and the balance has been furnished principally from the
funds, which would have been by this time completely exhausted
but for a legacy of L.400 Sterling, from a Mr Taylor, a native of
this parish, and some other legacies and donations of minor amount.
There is what is called Rainy's Mortification, besides, of L.20 a-
year, given to poor people not actually on the roll, to prevent their
falling ot it; but it is found from its working to have a contrary ten-
dency, practically hastening. what it was meant theoretically to
retard, if not to prevent.  The reluctance to receive parochial aid
is growing less daily.  Besides these regular supplies, we have
when extraordinary exigencies det-nand it, another source of re-
lieving distress, arising from the benevolence of the inhabitants,
and manifesting itself in subscriptions, public beggins, &c.
   Savings Bank.-There is a savings bank in the parish, from,
which good results continue to arise.  The money lodged in 1840
was L.1950.
   Inns.-There is only one inn in the parish, at Bagniebrae, at
the junction of the Banff and Aberdeen turnpikes.
   Fairs.-There are three annually at Hawkhall, in this parish,
for the sale of cattle, sheep, and general merchandise held on
third Tuesday of April, old style; last Thursday of May, old
style; and third Tuesday of September, old style.
