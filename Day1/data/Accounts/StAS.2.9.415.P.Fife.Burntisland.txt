Illigitimate births in the course of the last three years,
  From temporary causes, the population seems to have been
somewhat greater when the census was taken, than it would other-
wise have been. There has since been a considerable decrease.
According to a census taken four years after by the writer, the
number of families was found to be 500, giving a population of
about 2100. This decrease must chiefly be attributed to the great
failure in the herring fishery during the last five years. Employ-
ment having thus become scarcer, many have been compelled to
seek for it elsewhere. It has also happened, that several families,
not dependent on trade, have removed from the parish since the
Government census was taken, while others in similar circumstan-
ces have not come in to occupy their place.

  The average number of births for the last seven years may be stated at   65

  Twelve of the heritors are proprietors of land of the yearly
value of L. 50 and upwards. Of these only three are resident,
viz. the Messrs Young, who occupy the elegant residences of Col-
linswell, Grange, and Newbigging.
