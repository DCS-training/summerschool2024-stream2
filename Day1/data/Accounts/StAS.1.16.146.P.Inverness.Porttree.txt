and at the bottom of a rock, near the top of the declivity
above, is a cave, supposed to be very deep, into which, far-
ther than 12 yards, few have ever thought proper to enter.
Near 15 yards within its mouth it becomes darker, and
begins to descend; if a stone be thrown down here, it is
for some time heard to make a kind of rattling noise, as if
it were tumbling down a stone stair, to the sound of which
the cave echoes extraordinary loud; but whether, when
the sound seems to cease, the stone reaches the bottom, or
the cave takes a different direction, cannot be determined.
About 1 1/2 mile from hence, along the shore, down towards
the north, are two other caves that merit particular atten-
tion.  One of them is extremely narrow without; but
within becomes very spacious and high; capable of con-
taining with ease at least 500 persons.  Below its mouth,
up from high water mark to the level of the cave, the hol-
low rock is faced with a perpendicular wall, of large plain
stone, about 12 feet high, having several steps so narrow,
that only one man can ascend at a time.  Within, the air
freely circulates; in the middle is a well; and if they had
no fire arms, one man could easily defend the passage
against a host of foes: so that it seems to have been design-
ed both by nature and art, as a place of secure retreat,
though, if the tradition be true, it proved otherwise to one
party that retired to it for safety.  For the story goes, that
in the troublesome and barbarous times, when the neigh-
bouring districts plundered and destroyed each other, and
the weak were always a prey to the strong, many often re-
treated to this cave as a place of concealment and security.
At one time, however, they within, deeming themselves,
from their situation, too secure, were negligent in defend-
ing the passage.  Their enemies got intelligence they were
there, and surprising them in the night, filled the mouth of
the cave with timber and most heath and then setting
