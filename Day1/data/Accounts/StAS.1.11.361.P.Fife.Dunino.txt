part is annually under the above species of crops; the one
half, or near it, is to be yearly sown down with clover and
rye-grass.  This singular rotation must be uniformly and
punctually observed.  There being scarcely any cattle used
in husbandry here, and only 5 cottagers employed in it, who
have portions of land for part of their labour, the hired ser-
vant cultivates his fields with 2 middle sized horses yoked in
a plough, which is almost uniformly of the English construc-
tion.
