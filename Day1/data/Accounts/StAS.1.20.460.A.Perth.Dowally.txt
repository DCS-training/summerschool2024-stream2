within these few years, a little to the eastward of the
church.

     SITUATION AND EXTENT.

   Dowally was originally a part of the parish of Caputh,
and though it is now considered as united to Dunkeld, there
is no evidence existing of any formal annexation having ta-
ken place.  It is situated to the westward of Dunkeld, from
which it is separated by an interjected portion of Caputh;
and the main-body of it stretches along the north bank of
the Tay, in the shape of a parallelogram, beginning about
a mile and a half above Dunkeld, and extending fix miles.
At the upper extremity, the parish of Logierait occurs; and
a small stripe of it passing across Dowally, divides the
main body mentioned from the barony of Dalcapon, which
is an appendage belonging to it.  This barony lies on the
north bank of the Tumble, in length three quarters of a
mile.  The breadth of the parish is uncertain.  For as the
side of it which is most remote from the river, consists en-
tirely of high, barren, and uninhabited hills, it has never
been thought of importance to ascertain its line of limit with
minuteness.
   An able surveyor, who is well acquainted with the coun-
try, computes the extent of Dowally, in Scotch acres, as
follows:

<FOOTNOTE>

*When this cairn was removed, it was found to consist entirely of land
stones, and to have in the centre a single stone-coffin, 6 feet in length, and
4 in breadth, with a quantity of rich black earth, but no bones within it
The cairn was 30 feet in diameter, and about 6 in height.
