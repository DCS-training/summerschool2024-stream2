general, and the neighbouring counties of the stewartry and
the county of Galloway are also famous.  They are very profit-
able for fattening, and many thousands of them are annually,
sold and sent into England.  They are handsome, of a naid-
dle size, and weigh well for their height.  When fat for the
butcher, the four quarters weigh at an average 36 stones of 16
pounds; but several of them amount to 60 or 70 stones.  The
number of black cattle in the whole parish amounts to about
1200.  The sheep, which are kept in the hilly part of the
parish, are the common Scots sheep, white on the body, but
black on the face and legs; they are very hardy and their
wool is strong and shaggy, but coarse.  In the low cultivated
districts there are two kinds of English sheep, the one long

other is also long bodied, but broad backed and short legged,
introduced by Bakewell.  They are both all white, body,
face, and legs:  Both of them have much finer wool, and a
larger quantity of it, than the Scots sheep. Bakewell's kind
have the finest short wool.  From an experiment lately tried,
a cross between the two breeds seems to an answer well, yiz,

this cultivated district and mild climate, the English are prefer-

and finer quality, of the wool; their being less hurtful to the
hedges; and their greater weight when sold to the butcher.
The whole number of sheep in the parish, amounts at present
only to about 1000.

   The produce of the district is, on the whole, much greater
than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.  About
two thirds of the whole is carried to markets out of the parish,
viz. a considerable quantity of butter, milk, veal, mutton,
