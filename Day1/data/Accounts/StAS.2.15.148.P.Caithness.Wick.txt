     former degrading vassalage, and their comfort and respectability
     greatly promoted.   When Sir Benjamin Dunbar came into pos-
     session of his estate, there were but a very few farm-houses on it
     built with stone; now, there are very few, if indeed any, built of turf-
        The great improvement of land within the parish; of Wick may
     be seen from the following statement.  In 1666, the valued rent
     of the parish was L.6977, 6s. 8d. Scots.  In the corrected rental
     of last century, it stood thus :

           In 17912, the rent of the best land ranged from 10s. to 15s. per
        acre.  In all the parish at that period, there were of sown grass
        only 12 or 14 acres at Hempriggs, 8 in possession of the minister,
        and a few patches between Wick and Staxigoe.   There was not a
        cart in the parish, the ploughs were of the very rudest description,
        drawn'by three or four worthless. horses, with, perhaps, a couple
        of cows to assist, a lad tugging them on before, and a man holding
        the single stilt behind.  Such a phenomenon may yet indeed be
        seen, even in 1841.  The commenced improvement of the dis-
        trict, however' had already beneficially affected the wages of la-
        bour and the price of provisions.  In 1792, ploughmen, who bad,
        wine year before had no more than from 13s. 4d. to 18s. the
        half year, got from L. I to, I- 1, 8s. ; women-servants, who had, for
        the half, had from 6s. 8d. got from L. 1, to L. 1, 4s. day-
