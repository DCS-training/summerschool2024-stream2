     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF AUCHTERLESS.

     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF ABERDEEN, PRESBYTERY OF TUR-
     REF.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER ROSE.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, etc.

   THE name of the parish is said to be derived from the
Gaelic.  It is about 7 miles long and 3 broad.  The
soil is various; in some places a deep black mould, but the
greater part is light and gravelly, intermixed with clay, which
is early, and productive of good crops.  There are no moun-
tains nor hills.  A small river or rivulet called Ythan, abound-
ing with trouts, which takes its rise from two springs, runs
from the S. W. to the N. E., and passes through the parish.
In summer it can be stepped over in many places, but gradu-
ally increases by the addition of many other fireams as it
glides along towards the sea, and becomes a pretty large river
at Ellon, where a fine bridge has lately been built.
