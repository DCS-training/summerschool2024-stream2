Clyde are famous for the number and quality of their hares.
Other game is abundant; but woodcocks are beginning to be
scarce.
	The Clyde contains about twelve species of fishes, of which the
salmon is the principal. This fish, long scarce, has of late begun
to reappear; and during the last few seasons, it was particularly
abundant. This may, in some measure, be owing to the generally
swollen state of the river, which permits them to overcome the
serious obstacles they have to encounter at Blantyre Cotton Mills.
	Botany.--This parish presents a great variety of soil and sur-
face, and is therefore highly favourable for the growth of various
plants. A very complete and accurate list of these has been pub-
lished in a "Popular Description of the Indigenous Plants of
Lanarkshire, by the Rev. William Patrick." The following may
be given as a specimen of a few of the rarer and more interesting
sorts, viz:--

	Schoenus albus                        Hieracium sylvaticum
	Eriophorium vaginatum                 Habenaria trifolia
  Pos aquatica                          Listern Nidus-Avis
	Melica uniflora                       ------- ovata
	Symphytum tuberosum                   Nasturtium amara
	Solanum dulcamara                     Scolopendrium vulgare
  Erythraea                             Veronica montana
	Polygonum bistorta                    Asplenium Tricbomanes
	Chrysosplenium alternifolium          Doronicum Pardaliaches
	Stellaria nemorum

                      II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
	According to the Wishaw manuscript, "The barony of Cam-
busnethan belonged of old to a family of the name of Baird; after
whose forefaulture, it fell into the hands of Sir Alexander De
Stewart. From the Stewarts it passed into the hands of the Som-
mervilles, who were the proprietors for many ages. The first of
this name who was Laird of Cambusnethan, was Sir John Sommer-
ville; who married the heiress of Cambusnethan in 1372; suc-
ceeded his father in 1380, and died in 1405. He was buried in
the choir of Cambusnethan church, beside his wife, and was the
first of the name who was buried there. This ancient and valuable
barony remained in the hands of the Sommervilles for six genera-
tions; during which period, much of it was disponed to other heri-
tors; particularly, the lauds of Crindledyke and Branchellburn, to the
Laird of Lauchope; the lauds of Coltness, Wishaws, Watstein and
Stain, were purchased by Hamilton of Uddsten, the predecessor
of Lord Belhaven; Greenhead was purchased by John Robertson,
and Overtown and Pather, became the property, first of Lord Bel-
