ses.-If the season is favourable, most of the strongest land is
ploughed in the months of October, November, and Decem-
ber.-The rotation commonly observed of late, by the prin-
cipal farmers, is, to sow barley and grass seeds after the
land has been prepared by green crops; and, after resting for
two or three years, the same field is ploughed up again in the
month of August, with a rich foggage, which in a great mea-
sure supplies the want of manure; and yields the first year a
good crop of barley, the next a crop of oats, and the third
year, a crop of pease, potatoes, or turnips, which prepares it
for laying down again with barley and grass seeds.  By this
mode, the land is always kept clean, and in good condition.
But in must be remarked, that though this be the most approved
plan, few in the parish have hitherto followed it.  The people
in general, however, begin to see the advantage of sowing
grass seeds, and of adhering to a regular rotation of crops;
and it is very probable that the practice will prevail universal-
ly in the course of a few years.  The sheep farming lately in-
troduced into this country, will soon compel the people to sow
considerable quantities of grass seeds.-Formerly, they got
most of their cattle grazed on the neighbouring hills, at the rate
of 18 d. per head, for 4 or 5 months of the year:  these hills
are now covered with sheep; and the low country farmer must
reduce his stock of black-cattle, in proportion to the grass he
can raise annually upon his farm.

   Produce.-The vegetable productions of the parish have alrea-
dy been specified.  About two-thirds of the barley is distilled
in this and the neighbouring parishes into whisky; and nearly
the same proportion of oats and oat-meal is bought up by com-
mission, and carried to market;- so that the produce of the
parish is much more than sufficient for the consumpt of the in-
habitants.-With respect to animal productions, it is com-
