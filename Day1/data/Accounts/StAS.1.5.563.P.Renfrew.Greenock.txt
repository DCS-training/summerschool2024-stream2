Greenock and Port-Glasgow, and annually exported* by
the merchants of both places, a mass of that necessary com-
modity would, it is evident, be a source of great wealth
to the proprietor, and a very great benefit to the inhabi-
tants of these towns, and the places adjacent.  In digging
pretty deep well, etc. there have occurred strata of earth,
clay mixed with shells, sea sand, gravel, freestone, whin,
etc. but no appearance hitherto of that valuable fossil.
The hills, for the most part, seem to be a mass of whin,
very compact and solid in some parts; in others, especially
toward their summits, chinky and friable.  In not a few
places, the rocks seem once to have been in a state of fu-
sion, and loose stones scattered here and there, exhibit so
much the appearance of the cinders of a smithy furnace,
that there can be little doubt of their having undergone,
some time of other, the action of fire.  What minerals the 
Greenock hills may contain, is not known.  The deep
chasms made in them by sundry rivulets, which, after
heavy rains, descent in torrents, have been carefully exa-
mined.  In the drought of summer, the loose stones, peb-
bles, and sand, in the channel of these streams, have been
examined by the writer of this sketch; but excepting iron-
stone of a poor quality, which is frequently found, and a
little copper rarely in freestone, non metallic substance has
been hitherto discovered.

   Prospects.-From the brown of the hills viewed from the
town of Greenock, were the dreary sombre heath extirpated
by culture, or hidden by thriving plantations, the landscape,
which abounds in other beauties, would be very agreeable.
That trees would grow in such a situation, is little to be
doubted.  Young plants of the Scotch fir, (from feeds
