14s. 3d., with 20 lispunds butter, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion
elements.
   Education.-The parochial school is placed about the middle
of Tingwall. There are three schools supported by the So-
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge, one in Weesdale, one
in Whiteness, and one at Scalloway. In the island of Trondra,
there is one of the General Assembly's schools: and there is
another at Laxfirth, where Mr Hay has built a commodious school
and dwelling-house. Owing to the parish being SO intersected by
voes, there are many children who can attend none of these
schools.
   Poor.-There is a great proportion of poor, especially in Ting-
wall parish, and there are no funds for their support but the Sab-
bath-day collection, to which the absentee heritors have contri-
buted nothing, at least for the last thirty-three years.
