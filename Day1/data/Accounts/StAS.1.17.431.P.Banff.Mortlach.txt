     of Mortlach.

its shape, that of an oblong square of about 90 feet by 28, is
a very incommodious one, as a place of public worship, both
for the speaker and hearers, it will probably be found advise-
able to get over the veneration for its antiquity, and new model
it into a more convenient form The choir on the east end,
where the music was, and where the altar also would be, is 27
feet long, and a few feet higher than the rest of the build-
ing Here the door to the organ lost is still to be seen; and on
the ridge of the choir, is what they call the Three Bishops, a
pyramid like stone of little show, with the semblance of a
face on each of its sides, right rudely cut.  It has been said that
the effigy of Bishop Bryn is to be seen in the wall near the
postern door; whereabout it is imagined the tomb of the
three first bishops might be found under a vault: But this,
as to the effigy, is not the case And for the tomb, there
has been no search; nor are there any effigies in the church,
except one at full length, over the door which leads from the
choir to the Lessies Aisle or burying ground, with no inscrip-
tion, but called a predecessor of the Kinninvie family, and
celebrated as a man of marvellous gallantry; and two half
lengths, Alexander Duff of Keithmore and Helen Grant of
Allachie his spouse,* on the south side of the choir, with a
Latin inscription; all in freestone and basso relievo.  There
is another inscription in marble+, on a monument of Mr Hugh

<FOOTNOTE>

*Great grandfather and great grandmother of the present Earl
of Fife.
