       I. TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.

Name, Boundaries, &c.- Etymologists are somewhat at va-

uncultivated state, whins and brushwood generally abound.
   The parish is from six to seven miles in lenght, from two to

separating it from Holywood, Terregles, and Troqueer.
   Topographical Appearances.--The surface of the parish may be

on the side next the river; but on the north-east side, they are
much more abrupt, presenting a bold front and picturesque outline.
Rather more than a mile from the town, two precipitous ledges of
rock form the face of the hill, rising perpendicularly to a consider-
able heigh.  Near the summit of one of these precipices is a sin-
