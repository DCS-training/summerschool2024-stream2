important.  There is also in this parish an excellent rice-mill, which
was erected at Ormiston several years ago by the late proprietor;
but, from circumstances, it has never as yet been in active operation.

                   1801,                           973
                   1811,                          1007

  There are, as nearly as can be ascertained, 17 births, 10 marriages,
16 deaths, at an average, in this parish in the course of the year.
All the heritors have upwards of an annual rental of L. 50 Sterling,
and only one of them resides in the parish.  There are 2 deaf
and dumb, and 3 fatuous persons in the district.  The popula-
tion of this parish, in so far as can be traced, is greater at present
than it has been at any previous period of its history.  This increase
is no doubt owing to the general improvement which has taken
place on the character of the soil, and which of course renders a
greater number of hands necessary for the purposes of agriculture
than formerly.
  Character of the People.--The people are in general cleanly in
their habits, industrious in their conduct, and regular in their at-
tendance on the ordinances of religion.  They enjoy, in a reason-
able degree, the comforts and advantages of society, and may be
said upon the whole, to be contented with their circumstances in
life.  The ordinary food of the peasantry is meal, potatoes, butter-
milk, and pork of their own rearing.  The bread commonly used
by them is a compound of barley and pease meal, and it is consi-
dered as extremely wholesome.  To these is occasionally added a
little butcher meat.  Poaching, both in game and in the salmon
fisheries, is not unfrequently practised in the district.
