inches, and the lowest in March following to be 27.9 inches. In
February 1671 be found it stand as high as 30 inches, and in May
following as low as 27.5 inches; in the one season the range be-
ing 2 inches and in the other 2 1/2 inches. The great height of the
mercurial column during the month of October, and also in gene-
ral during winter, did not escape the notice of Sinclair, though
not aware of the analogous fact in regard to the cold, dense, dry
air of the circumpolar regions.*  In 1809, the annual fall of rain
at Dalkeith, according to Professor Playfair, was 28.5 inches;
while at Large on the west coast, during the same year, it was no
less than 40.6 inches. During the twelve months of the following
table, the annual fall was 25.54 inches; while at Rothesay, 41.35.

results,

   Thus the barometric range is 2.142 inches, and the mean tem-
perature 47.55\d, while the temperature of the well at the level of
the Esk is 48\d-a satisfactory coincidence of result from methods
so different.

                     II.-CIVIL HISTORY.
   No connected history of the town and parish of Dalkeitli, beyond
what is found in the Gazetteers of Scotland, has hitherto appeared.

<FOOTNOTE>Vide Sinclair's Hydrostatics, and "Proteus Bound," appended to his "Prin-
ciples of Astronomy." Previous to the application of the barometer to indicate the
state of the weather, the air thermometer of Sanctorius seems to have been in com-
mon use for this purpose, which was an imperfect instrument for such an object,
from its being readily influenced both by heat and atmospheric pressure. This Sinclair
pointed out; and proposed to render this instrument more useful by filling it with
the spirit of wine, and sealing it hermetically, by which he obtained an instrument
similar to the present spirit-of-wine thermometer. It is, indeed, not a little curious
that Sinclair in some measure anticipated the late Sir John Leslie in his very useful
insrument for meteorological purposes, the differential thermometer. In his "Ars
Nova et Magna." published at Rotterdam, 1669, Sinclair thus describes, under the
name of Thermosoope, an instrument exactly similar to one of the forms of the dif.
ferential thermometer: "Fuit enim thermoscopium utrinque hermetice occlusum.
Nam inferne rotundam habuit ampullam: superne etiam aliam: sed altera multo
minorem. Inter has tenuem admodum fistulam. Ejus ditnidium inferius aqua, vel
potius prestantisimo vini spiritu, superius vero  aere repletum."-Lib. iii. p. 273,
