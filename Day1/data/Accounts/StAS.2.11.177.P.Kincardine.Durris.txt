is 25; the yearly sum allowed to each, at an average, is L. 1, 15s.
The annual amount of collections at the church is L. 33, includ-
ing a little for mortcloth money. Interest of money lent, L. 10;
penalties and occasional donations, L. 6, 10s. No other mode
has been adopted here, of providing for the poor. The reluctance
to receive parochial relief is now rarely to be met with. Besides
the above persons receiving aid, there are nearly as many who re-
ceive a small sum yearly from Mr Hog's mortification already men-
tioned. The sum left was L. 500 three per cents reduced, yielding
L. 15 a-year. This was sold out, a few years ago, for L. 420, `nd
placed at interest in this country. The particulars are these
L. 5 to a schoolmaster; L. 1 to the kirk-session, for their trouble
in managing the fund; 10s. to the session-clerk for keeping the
books; 10s. to the herds round the hill of Cairnshea, to make a
midsummer fire on that hill, where the donor himself had once
kept cattle; and the remainder, about L. 9, to poor householders
not on the poor's roll.
	Fairs.--There are three fairs held in the parish annually, one
in May, one in June, and one in September, all for selling cattle;
none of them very numerously attended.
	Inns.--There are four inns, where`s one, or at most two, should
be sufficient.
	Fuel.--The fuel mostly used is peats and turf from the hills.
For a farmer's house, sixty or seventy loads are required in a year,
one-half peats and the other half turf; expense per load, casting
and drying, of peats 1s., of turf, 7d., besides driving them home,
which is done with their own horses and servants. When driving
is paid for, the cost is 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. per load, according to the
distance. Most families, however, besides this species of fuel, use
a few bolls of English coal.
