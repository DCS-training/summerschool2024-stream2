   Shrubs and Trees.-The juniperus communis was men-
tioned under the article of plants, a good deal of it grows
here, and to the westward, on the base of the hills.  Some
times the poor people gather the fruit of it in considerable
quantities, and carry it to Dundee, where they sell it at
about 1 s. the peck.  When it is ripe, they spread a cloth
under the branch, and beat down the berries with a stick.
A little of this fruit taken in the morning before breakfast,
is said to be as good as a dram; probably it is much better,
being an excellent stomachic.  The smoke of the juniper
is thought to be destructive to moths and bugs, none of the
latter of which are ever found in this part of the country.
Some of the common people here make an infusion of the
juniper-berry, which they use for tea; perhaps it might be,
in many cases, a good substitute for Bohea, and fully as
conducive both to health and to strength.  Being in every
form a powerful diuretic, it is highly proper to be used in
every case where there are any indications of a calcareous
diathesis.  The broom abounds here: It blooms in June;
and at that time, the butter, made from the milk of the
cows that seed upon its blossoms, partakes in a high de-
gree of their beautiful tincture.  The furze is also frequent,
of which horses are exceedingly fond in winter; and while
they feed on it, it is observed, that they never catch
cold.  On the banks of the Lunan, there is a shrub, here
called the hack berry, (prunus padus) that carries beauti-
ful flowers, which are succeeded by a cluster of fine black-
berries; they are sweet and luscious to the taste, but their
particular qualities are not known.  In the parish of Laigh-
wood we meet with plenty of the black floe, which ripens
here in October and November: The common people eat
