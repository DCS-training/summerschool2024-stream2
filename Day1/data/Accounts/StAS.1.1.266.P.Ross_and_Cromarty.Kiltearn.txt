but not quite so small as the common breed of cattle in coun-
ties farther to the north.  But the gentlemen and principal
farmers have been at great pains to improve their breed of
cattle by purchasing some from Fife and Moray, which are
considerably larger than the common breed of the country.
Some of the last mentioned, when full fed, fell for L. 10 or
L. 12.  The horses of the parish are also of two kinds;
some of a large Galloway size, which the gentlemen use in
ploughing and carting, value from L. 10 to L. 20 each;
and a few worth L. 25.  But the greatest number of horses
are what are commonly called Hihgland Garrons, value from
L. 3 to L. 5 each.  There are few goats in the parish; and
these are the property of two tenants, who occupy very re-
mote possessions.  The number of sheep at present is very
inconsiderable, and, for the most part, of a very interior qua-
lity, being of a small size, and producing very little wool.  At
present, there are only two or three farmers in the parish
who manage their sheep properly; and one of their sheep is
worht two of any other farmer's.  The rearing of sheep has
been rather discouraged for some time past, being found so
destructive to young plantations of timber; but it is not
doubted that, in a few years, the rearing of this useful animal
will become a principal object both with the landlords and te-
nants.

   We shall conclude this article, by giving a list of the num-
ber of horses, black cattle, and sheep, in the parish, which,
according to the best information, cannot be far distant from
the truth.
