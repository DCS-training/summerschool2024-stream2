Pastoral Society.-" To  facilitate   the  improvement  of  live
stock," says Mr Alexander Laidlaw, in observing and intelligent 
farmer, "the first pastoral society was instituted in 1818, by the 
enterprizing exertions, and under the immediate patronage, of Lord
Napier.  It can now reckon amongst its memebers the greater
part of the landed prpprietors of the county, besides a good many
patriotic gentlemen of the country.   And it has not only been uni
formly supported by every repectable farmer in Selkirkshire, but
also by many of that valuable class of men in Peebles, Roxburgh,
and Dumfries-shires.   This society not only stirs up a spirit of
emulation among farmers in general, but serves also as a school
where the young farmer will see the real and apparent properties
of live stock pointed out by the judges, but also hear the relative
advantages and disadvantages of almost every breed fearlessly dis-
cussed at the annual general meeting." The society meets an-
nually, and generally on the 18th June. The meetings are held
at the three following places, viz one year at Newark, near Sel-
kirk; another at Tinnies, in Yarrow; and the third at Thirlstane
fair grounds, in Ettrick.*
