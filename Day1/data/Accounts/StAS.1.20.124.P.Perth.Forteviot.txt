     " Primus in Albania fertur regnasse Kinedbus,

     " Expulsis Pictis, reguaverat octo bis annis,
     " Atque Fortemet*, mortum ille fuit."

   Halyhill, near the present church, but a great part of
the site of which is said to have been carried off by the wa-
ter of Mey, was the summer residence of Malcolm Can-
more, and others of the Scottish kings, who granted many
charters from this place.  At certain distances from the pa-
lace wer erected large stones, by way of pillars: as the
Standing-stone of Bankhead and Cross of Dronochy.  Seve-
ral urns and stones-coffins, with fragments of human bones,
were found, some years ago, in different parts of the parish.
The mill of Forteviot, and the Coblehaugh, mentioned by
Andrew Wyntoun, yet remain.  At Coblehaugh was the
boat for ferrying over the Earn.  The miller's daughter
was mother to Malcolm Canmore.
   An account of some of these, and other antiquities in the
parish, was communicated to the public, in one of the ma-
gazines printed at Edinburgh, about 24 or 25 years ago.
That account was written by Mr Taylor, then schoolmas-
ter at Forteviot, now at Kinross+.

   +The Halyhill, as it is commonly called, a small eminence at the west
end of Forteviot, was once the site of a royal residence, first.  It would
appear, of the Pictish, and afterwards of some of the Scottish, kings.
Here Kenneth II, having reigned in peace sixteen years, after receiving the
death of his father Alpin, whom the Pict, beheaded, by exterminating
that people, and entirely subjugating their territory, died of a fistula.  The
place seems to have been a favourite residence of King Malcolm Canmore,
