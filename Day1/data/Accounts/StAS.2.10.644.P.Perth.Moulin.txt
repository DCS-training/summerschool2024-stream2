	  Forests, &c.-There are several kinds of plantations in the pa-
	rish.  The sorts of timber to which the soil appears most conge-
	nial are, oak, ash, Scotch fir, spruce, birch, and larch.  There is
	a considerable extent of natural wood, consisting of oak and birch.
         The highly picturesque and romantic pass of Killiecrankie  * is
	clothed chiefly with the latter.  All species of fruit trees and all
	varieties of shrubs and roses, are to be found in our orchards,
	shrubberies, and flower-gardens.

         <FOOTNOTE>It was, I think, Dr M' Culloch who says, that Killiecrankie derived its name
	from the site nf a, chapel recently existing there.  The Gaelic of the word is coile-
	chrionaich, decayed brushwood, and in contradistinction to which there is in the
	neighbourhood " Orchil" urchoille young wood; " Faskally" fas-choille, a young
	thriving wood.  It is true this latter word may also mean " a desert wood."  There
	can be no doubt,however, `s to the meaning of Killiecrankie.  The old Gaelic pro-
	verb explains it: " Cha chuirinn mo,thuagh Bhearnach ann do choille-chrionaich."  I
	would not put my chipped  axe in your withered brushwood."  For many a year sub-
	sequent to 1689, Killiecrankie was an object of dread to the regualarly disciplined
	soldier.  Such was the impression which the Hessian troops entertained of this pass,
	that , in 1746, no argument could prevail upon them to approach it.  In their imagi-
	nations, it was the ultima thule of a civilized country.
