     Statistical Account

of the parish, as a true and exact copy; or by three elders in
case of a vacancy; together with an authentic account of the 
number of souls in the parish, made out in such manner as
might be found necessary; and this extract and note of the
number of souls in the parish to be lodged, upon a certain day,
each year, in an office at Edinburgh, appointed for that pur-
pose;  it would be a source of valuable information, to which
resource might be had, when found necessay, with little
trouble.  The cause of the increase of the population in the
town of Rothesay, since the year 1766, may be a custom-
house established there in 1765, the herring fishery, and a
cotton spinning mill, erected there about twelve or thirteen
years ago.

   Church and Stipend, etc.-The church was built about the
year 1690, and the manse in 1757.  The stipend is about
L. 80 Sterling, exclusive of the manse and glebe.  The Earl
of Bute is patron.  There are four heritors in the country
part of the parish, and a number of small proprietors within
the territory of the town.  The number of poor persons re-
ceiving charity may be about 70.  The amount of collections
and funds for their support is about L. 60.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The language principally spoken
in the parish is the Gaelic; the names of the places seem, in
general, to be derived from it.  There is an old castle in
the town of Rothesay, now a ruin, but formerly sometimes
the residence of the Kings of Scotland, and afterwards inha-
bited by the family of Bute, heritable constables of it, till it
was burnt during the troubles in 1685.  The fuel used
in the country part of the parish is peat, and some coal.
Scarcely any thing but coal is used in the town.  It is ge-
nerally imported from Glasgow, at a great expence.  The
