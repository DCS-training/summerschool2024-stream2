from Straiton, and three from Dalmellington. The house is a
plain fabric, but the natural beauties of the grounds are of a pecu-
liar and very high order. The Marquis of Ailsa has a shooting
lodge eight miles from Straiton, which stands on the banks of the
Stinchar, among rugged cliffs and lofty mountains.
	Parochial Registers.--The registers of the parish commence in
the year 1644. They are regular in the registration of births and
marriages, excepting during the reign of James, till 1770. From
that period till 1825, they are very imperfect. During the last
twelve years they have been kept with great care, embracing al-
most all that have been born or that have died within the parish,
not, as is sometimes the case, only those thaf were baptised or
buried in the parish. The session records begin in 1734, and,
with the exception of a few years, about fifty years ago, are com-
plete from that period. From these records, instances of immo-
rality appear to have been as frequent in former days as in our
own age, though, there were undoubtedly more examples of men
of ardent piety, and of zealous attendance on sacred ordinances.
