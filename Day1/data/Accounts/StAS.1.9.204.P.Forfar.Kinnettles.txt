L. 44: 3: 3 10/12 Sterling; in victual, 2 chalders of meal, and
1 chalder of barley, each kind valued at 13 s. 4 d. which,
with the old glebe, about 6 acres, and 2 1/2 acres of moor,
obtained in lieu of a servitude, at L. 1, 10 s. the acre, the
whole may be rated at L. 88: 18: 3.  In point of benefit,
I am much at a loss how to estimate a glebe.  A minister

though sown so early.  In wettish land and not into such order, there will
be little straw, and altogether a deficient crop, if it be not sown consider-
ably later.  English barley, which demands our best soil, and in the high
est condition, requires to be sown from the 20th of April to the 5th of
May, in order to produce good and sufficiently early grain; Scotch barley,
from the beginning to the 15th of May; common Scotch bear, from the
10th to the 25th of May.  Our pease are of the hastings kind, and do not
require to be sown before the middle or 20th of April.  Lint-seed, from
the 20th to the end of April.  It was earlier with some last season, by 14
or 20 days; but where this was the case, the seed lay uncommonly long in
the ground without shooting; some of it was sickly during a good part of
summer; nor could it be said to be sooner ready for pulling, than that
which had been sown about the usual time.  Smart nights and mornings
are frequent about the end of April, rendering the lint crop very un-
certain, if it get above ground before the 1st of May.  They plant pota-
toes from the 20th of April to the beginning of May; and sow turnips
from the 10th to the 20th or 22d of June.  The reaping tune must vary
according to the nature of the summer.  Hay, which is not inter add for
feed. is cut from the 1st to the 10th of July; what is intended for rye
grass seed, 8 or 10 days later.  Lint harvest is from the 12th to the 25th
of August, sometimes a few days later.  The earliest and latest com
mencement of barley harvest, which I remember, was the 15th of August.
and the last day of September.  In the years 1775, 1779, and 1783, the
barley harvest began from the 15th to the 18th of August; in the year
1782, it began the last day of September.  The barley harvest usually be
gins about the 1st or 5th of September.  Wheat is cut down about the
same time with barley.  Out barley, for the most part, begins to be cut
down about 10 or 14 days before the beginning of oat harvest.  In 1779.
the corns on dry farms were all got in by the 10th or 12th of September,
In 1782, they were not got in with some till the 22d of November;
with others; some days later.
