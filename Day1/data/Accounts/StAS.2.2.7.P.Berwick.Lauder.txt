   Habits and Character of the People.-It may be affirmed of the
people, on the whole, that they enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the
comforts and advantages of society, and that they are contented
with their situation; as one indication of which it may be stated,
that few families in the parish,-not more than four or five,-have,
in recent times, emigrated from the land of their fathers. Their
character is, no doubt, as in every other place, considerably divers-
fied, some being neither wise nor good; but, in general, they are
well informed,-orderly in their conduct,-and observant of the
ordinances of religion. Poaching, though instances of it may be
occasionally detected, is not prevalent; and smuggling does not
seem to exist.

   Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The number of imperial acres
in the parish is 37,753. Of these 12,060 are either cultivated, or
occasionally in tillage, and 25,043, never having been cultivated re-
main waste, or in pasture. Several hundred acres might, with a pro-
fitable application of capital, be added to the cultivated land, and
afterwards kept in occasional tillage, or in permanent pasture; but
perhaps there is very little of the waste lands which would yield to
the farmer a fair remuneration for their improvement during the
currency of an ordinary lease. In a state of undivided common,
there are 2381 acres, of which 686, in the higher grounds of Lam-
mermoor, are the joint property of the Marquis of Tweeddale and
the Earl of Lauderdale, and are depastured by the sheep of their
tenants; and 1695, outfield land, belong to the corporation of Lau-
