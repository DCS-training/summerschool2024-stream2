     NUMBER II.

     PARISH OF SHOTTS,

     (COUNTY OF LANARK, PRESBYTERY OF HAMILTON,
     SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR.)

     By the Rev. Mr ARCHIBALD BRUCE, Minister.

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish, in the public records, is called BERTRAM
SHOTTS.  The name seems explanatory of nothing pecu-
liar to the place, and the accounts of tradition are so ap-
parently fabulous, as far to exceed the belief of even the
most credulous antiquarian.  Shotts is satuated in the north-
east point of Lanarkshire.  It is one of the largest lowland
parishes in Scotland, forming nearly an oblong square, 10
miles in length, and 7 in breadth.
   Soils and Value.-The lands which lie towards the corner
of the parish are a mixture of clay and sand; will yield 5
bolls an acre, and may be rented at 9 s.  Those towards the
S. E. are of a black soil, and will yield 4 bolls an acre;
rent 7 s.  Along the greater part of the S. and the whole
