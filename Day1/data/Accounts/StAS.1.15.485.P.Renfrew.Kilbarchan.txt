from South-west, to North-east, instead of being an objec-
tion, confirms this hypothesis; for all our trees are bent in
this direction, by the prevailing current of our winds.  A
tree, whether cut down or decaying, naturally falls in the
direction to which it leaned while growing.  The Romans
produced many mosses by cutting down the woods, to which
our ancestors sled for shelter.  Others have doubtless been
produced from woods allowed to fall through decay.
   From what has been observed of the quick growth of moss,
it should seem that this one is not very ancient.  What con-
firms this opinion is, that many places round this, and other
mosses in this country, still retain the name of wood.  As

Oak-Shaw-head, (shaw is wood) Walkinshaw, &c.
   Advancing westward from this flat and level part of the
parish, where the soil is of a deep stiff clay, the surface be-
comes diversified with gentle rising.  The soil here consists
of a more friable and loamy clay, intermixed with stones.
Two thirds of the parish westward is of a light and shallow
soil, composed of the mouldered particles of whin rocks, on
which it rests.  This soil, where of sufficient depth, is ex-
tremely fertile.  As you advance westward, the ground be-
comes more and more rocky, with patches of the same light
shallow soil, interposed between the rocks.  Among the rocks
are several swamps, which proper draining would reduce to an
excellent soil.  In these higher parts, there is very little heath,
and, with a little lime, these shallow soils produce grass and
corn of an excellent quality.
   The rocks here are wholly composed of whin.  Many of
them have a basaltic appearance.  The north side of the Bar-
hill is a basaltic perpendicular rock; though not very regular
in its formation.  All the low part of the parish abounds in
