to observe that the people have almost entirely recovered the
effects of that baneful season.
   In 1735, Dowager Lady Saltoun mortified 1000 merks for
the benefit of three old persons.  The interest is applied ac-
coring to the will of the noble donor.
   A few years ago, an excellent school-house was built, with
lodgings fit for accommodating the school-master and several
boarders.  On the front of the house is placed a good carving
of Moses and the ten commandments, on free-stone, found
in the college of Fraserburgh, and said to have been intended

and the almost exhausted mosses in the low country would be easily turned
into grass or arable land.-Were the practice introduced of preparing peats
in these mosses, by persons who could make it their employment, and who
would bring them down, to farmers, and to the inhabitants of towns
and villages, for sale, the great incoveniencies of the scarcity of fuel, or
the loss of time to the industrious on the coast, would in some measure be a-
