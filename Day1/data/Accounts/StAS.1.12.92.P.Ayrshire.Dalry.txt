trial of this has not been made.  But the greatest quantity of
ground in the parish, is of a very different quality, much in-
clined to clay of different colours, and of a tilly, wet bottom.
There is also a good deal of moss-ground, not only in the
hilly part of the parish, but also in the lower parts of it.
Some of which, has of late, by a sensible process, been brought
from its natural state, to bear very good crops, both of oats

years it is expected, that a great part of them will be made
fit to bear very good crops both of oats and grass.

   Division and Rents.-Within these 40 years past, the great-
est part, if not almost the whole of the parish, has been en-
closed.  When enclosing first began, it was effected with some
difficulty, as the adjoining heritors or tenants, were not only
unwilling to bear half of the expense, but could not think of
being deprived of a liberty they had long been accustomed to
take, of pasturing their cattle upon their neighbour's ground,
which was often of more advantage to their cattle, than feed-

little selfish views, which they soon did, a spirit of enclosing
took place, as they evidently perceived, that enclosing, not
