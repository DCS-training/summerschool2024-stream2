ther Committee of Parliament, for the disjucntion and erection of church-
es, and modification of stripends in Argylshire, appointed by an unprint-
ed statute, 21st January 1649, met at Inveraray in 1650 and 1651.  Upon
the proceedings of this Committee, which are still preserved in the posses-
sion of the Synod and Argyll, a regular report of their decrees was made
out, and authenticated, which also remained in the possession of the Synod,
until of the late years, that it was brought from them, by warrant of the Court
of Session, and also lodged in the leind-office.  Many of the benefices and
livings of the ministers in the shire of Argyll, at this day, are founded
upon no other title than these decreets.  The parish of Gleneray in par-
ticular, was thereby disjoined, and erected into two distinct charges, name-
ly, the Higland charge, which was given to the first minister of the pa-
rish, and the Lowland or English congregation, which was given to the
second.  Part of the provision of the latter was composed of 3 chalders
victual, payable out of the Bishop teinds of Bute, the tends of the parish
itself being inadequate to the stipend payable to the second minister.
These 3 chalders were regularly received by him, from the 1652 to the
1724; but the Earl of Bute, having obtained a grant from the Crown of
all the teinds of the Isle of Bute, he witheld payment of these 3 chalders.
The Synod acquiesced in this grant, not knowing that it was out of the
power of the Crown, without consent of Parliament, to dispose of the
bishop's rents, of grant any deed so as to invalidate the decreet of locali-
ty 1651, in favour of the charge of the Lowland congregation at Inve-
raray; which decree had been awarded by a Committion specially ap-
pointed by Parliament 1649; was confirmed by the rescissory acts (61) an-
no 1691, and (28) anno 1663, and the acts 1689 and 1690; was approven
of by the High Commission 1st December 1690, and fortified by the horn-
ing 1691, the act of treasury, in July following, and uninterrupted posses-
sion from the 1651 to the 1661, and from the 1698 to the 1724.  But, in
a process brought at the instance of the minister before the Court of Ses-
sion, in 1770, for the recovery of these 3 chalders, the cause was un-
fortunately argued by both parties, as if the decreet in his favour, had been
pronounced by the High Commission for Plantation of Churches, which
always fat at Edinburgh, without ever attending, that in fact the decreet
had issued from a commission of Parliament, appointed for the province
of Argyle, by the unprinted statute 1649, which actually fat at Inveraray
for the years 1650 and 1651, and carried of business as if no civil war had
