     of Assint.

Fields to be laid down with bear, and such as are to be
planted with potatoes*, after having been once ploughed,
are thereafter manured, and upon their being tilled a second
time, are instantly sown, and harrowed.  Sea-weed is
the principal manure, all along the shore.  Some little
tracts of moor and barren ground are yearly every where
brought into cultivation by potatoe-planting; but the whole
arable ground, ploughed and delved throughout the whole
parish, does not probably bear the proportion of one acre
to an hundred, of what is hill pasture, moor and moss.
The old Scotch plough is the only one used here; four
hardy native horses are yoked to it.  The other imple-
ments of husbandry are harrows, the crooked and straight
delving spades, English spades, some mattocks, cabbies,
crook saddles, and creels.  It is with these two last men-
tioned that the manure is carried on horseback to the field,
as neither cart nor waggon are yet used here.

   Seed Time and Harvest.-Seed time, as above mentioned,
if the spring proves favourable, begins early in March,
and in that event, the labouring is finished by the close of
May, or some days thereafter.  If the harvest be a good
one, the crop will be secured by the latter end of Septem-
ber; but this happens very seldom, by reason of excessive
rains, which, if they come on in March, lengthen the la-
bouring to the 24th of June, and of course very probably
the ingathering of the crop is protracted to the end of Oc-

*When in the 1765 the narrator was admitted to the charge of Assint,
there were no potatoes, except a few planted in his predecessor's garden.
In the 1766, a half boll for seed was got, small presents were made, the
manner how to plant, etc. was shown.  At first the natives were indiffe-
rent; however, being persuaded to persevere, and finding their great
advantage, they have ever since improved in the skill of planting their
plots and fields of potatoes.
