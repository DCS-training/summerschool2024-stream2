     General Appendix to

   Morals.-I am not disposed to give ill-grounded praise on
this important subject, and I hope I shall not unjustly blame:
There is, however, too much ground to complain, as to mo-
rals, in all places; yet the general turn of the people, in this
quarter, is towards sobriety and decency.  We have not, at

drowns the cry of injured innocence, with the rude cla-
mours of rooted prejudices?  It is well known, that general-
ly speaking, these things originate in cities, among the vici-
ous; the profane, the dissipated, and chiefly among those who
have learnt the art of casting off the fear of God.  The coun-
try may be misled; but it is not naturally disposed to wick-
