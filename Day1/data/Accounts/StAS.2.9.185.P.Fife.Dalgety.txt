  There are thus only four workable seams of coal, named the
Blawlowan, Coalthief, Mynheer, and Splint.-The Blawlowan is
a soft cubical coal, it is generally used in Iime-works, burns slow-
ly, and produces white asbes.-The Mytiheer is an excellent splint
coal, burns with little ashes, is used for steam-machinery, but it is
best adapted for household purposes.-The Coalthief is a strong
cubical coal, free of all iron pyrites, burns clean, works large, and is
principally used by distillers and manufacturers.-The Main Splint
is a very superior coal to the other three. It burns free of ashes,
leaves a small cinder, is very bituminous, works large, and has an
exceedingly strong flame when burning, and from its durability and
superior quality, is considered the best in Scotland for steam navi-
gation and household purposes, for which immense shipments are
made all over the continent.
  Having given a short account of the coal-field of this parish, an
its connection with those of the adjoining parishes, we shall shortly
state the quantity of coal still remaining to be wrought. This, we
are sorry to say, is reduced to a comparatively small extent, as may
be easily conceived from the length of time during which it has
been wrought. There is, it is generally believed, coal to work on
the Fordel estate for thirty years at a moderate rate, as there still
remains one or two coal-fields untouched, but the mining appara-
tus not being directed in that quarter, it may be some time before
they are explored. I am also inclined to think that there are se-
veral great coal seams throughout the parish, particularly in the
southern division, and which may soon be examined, especially those
lying in the direction of the strath, in front of Fordel House, where
evident proofs of a coal formation have been traced. It may be
sufficient at present to mention, that in the parishes of Aberdour,
Dalgety, Inverkeithing, and Dunfermline, there are coalfields
