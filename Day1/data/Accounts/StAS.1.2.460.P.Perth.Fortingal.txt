     Statistical Account

   No manufacturers can be established here, owing to the
scarcity of meal and fuel.  Perhaps it might be more for the
public and private advantage, if the people should spin their
wool instead of lint, and send it to market in that state.  Im-
mense packs of wool are sent away every year to Perth, Stir-
ling, etc.  The wool is coarse, owing to the south country
breed we have got among us, and sells only from 7 s to 8 s per
stone.
   The great grievances, under which this parish labours, are,
the largeness of some of the farms, and there being scarce any
leases.  In regard to the first, it is questionable, whether the
great farmers can afford to pay as high rents, as the moderate-
ly large ones, as they live in a stile of much greater luxury and
expence.  As to the second point, no great improvements can
be expected; at least on the part of the tenants, whilst the
tenure, by which they hold their lands, continues so tempo-
rary and precarious.
   In regard to the general character of the people, they are as
industrious, pious and charitable as any of their neighbours,
or perhaps any in the kingdom.
