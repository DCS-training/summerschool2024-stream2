     Statistical Account

   Roads, Bridges, Minerals, Fuel.-The roads and bridges
through this parish are in a tolerably good condition.
They were originally made, and are still kept in repair by
statute labour.  The bridge at the village of Laurencekirk,
indeed, has been lately raised and widened at Lord Gar-
denstone's expence.-Moor-stone, and free or sand-stone, are
to be found through this parish.-Peats, whins, and broom
are the only fuel it affords.  Coals are brought from Mon-
trose, which is 10 miles distant.  The boll costs 8 s. 6 d. on
the shore, besides 3 s. 6 d. carriage.-One weak chaly-
beate spring rises near Johnston.  Ist wear is used indis-
criminately in various cases, and sometimes not without
success.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-It is a happy circumstance
in the situation of this parish, that it lies in the middle of
the Mearns, and is interfected by the great north road, lead-
ing from Edinburgh to the north, through Perth, Aberdeen,
Banff, Elgin, Inverness, etc.  It is thus a considerable thorough-
fare; and derives no small advantage from the numbers of
travellers who are perpetually passing.  In the spring of
that calamitous year, 1783, when a general scarcity took
place, from the failure in the preceding crop, the kirk-ses-
sion agreed to advance L. 50, and the administrators of the
burgh L. 20, for the purchase of a quantity of meal, to be
retailed in the course of the summer, in such small quanti-
tise as the kirk-session should respectively direct, to the in-
dustrious poor within the parish; the distribution to be re-
gulated by tickets, and the price so reduced, that the session
should lose L. 25 Sterling, and the burgh L. 10, by the pur-
chased and the sale.  By these precautions the poorer peo-
ple were supplied with meal throughout the whole season,
at the rate of 1 d. a-peck cheaper than it was sold any
where in the neighbourhood, and lost no time in wandering
about in search of it, which was the case in other places.
