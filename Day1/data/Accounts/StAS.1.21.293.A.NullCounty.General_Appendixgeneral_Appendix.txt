     The Statistical Account.

ther my studies nor views were directed to such subjects, I
could not resist a certain impulse which led me, repeatedly, to
examine the ground, and still makes me ardently wish, that,
some time or other, a national spirit of improvement would
be excited to open this communication, which nature seems
to have intended, as the most important object, for commer-
cial enterprize, that ever was undertaken in Great Britain.
   There is no person of common observation that travels
from Fortwilliam, through Strath Lochy, to Inverness, but
must be struck with the astonishing contrast, between a level,
upwards of 60 miles long, extending across the island from
sea to sea, and ranges of the highest hills in Scotland on
both sides.  This level, which is nearly in a straight line from
N. E. to S. W. consists of land and water: so that nature
not only favours such an undertaking (by the flatness of the

half of it already.  Lochness is reckoned 20 miles in leghth,
Lock Lochy 16, and Loch Oich 5; in all, upwards of 40
miles.

enlarged views of the present state of the country, they must
be obvious and striking, even upon a bare inspection of the
map, As they occur to me, the advantages of this canal may
be considered in three points of view:  First, As it respects
the adjacent countries; Secondly, The commercial interest of
England and Ireland; and Lastly, The improvement of the
fisheries, and the introduction of trade and manufactures in-
to the Western Isles and Highlands of Scotland.

tries of Urquhart, Glenmorison, part of Abertarf, Glengary,
and that part of Lochaber which surround Locharcaig and
