fields with the seeds of turnip, and other succulent
plants.  Our soil is generally light, and not considered as
the most proper for pease, or wheat, though both of
them, in some parts of the parish, thrive very well.
Oats, barley, turnips, and potatoes, make, in general,
good returns.  The curling of potatoes, so much and
justly complained of in England, is not prevalent in this
country.  Making allowance for the difference of soil,
seasons, cultivation, and other circumstances, the seve-
ral kinds of grain, which are sown in this parish, may
be stated, upon the whole, as yielding the following in-
crease:  Wheat from 6 to 10, and sometimes 12 fold;
pease from 4 to 8; barley from 5 to 7; and oats, 4, 7,
or 8 fold:  Potatoes, at an average, may be reckoned at
30 fold, though, in many places, the increase is much
less.  An acre of turnips is worth 5 L. or 6 L. and will fat-
ten 2 small oxen, which, when full fed, will weigh each
of them, about 25 stone English weight.  I am informed,
that the butchers in Edinburgh give to the farmers in
that neighbourhood nearly double the value, which I
have set upon a turnip crop; but it ought also to be ob-
served, that this is of much more value to the butchers
than to the farmers, as the latter must sell their fed
cattle, so that the purchaser may have a profit, whereas
the former kill them; and selling the meat, skin, and
tallow, to their respective buyers, get for all these arti-
cles, the current price of the different markets.  Be-
sides, for the sake of convenience, the butchers may some-
times be induced to give more than the intrinsic worth
of the crop.
   The greater part of the hay in this part of the coun-
try is made of rye-grass and red clover, the seeds of
which are sown with barley, and sometimes with oats or
