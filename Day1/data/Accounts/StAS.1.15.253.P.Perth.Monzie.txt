The meal mills make very good pot barley, without any ad-
ditional machinery.  There is only one yearly market in the
parish, when every house, hut, and shade, is converted into
a dram-shop; it is held in the middle of August.

   Romantic Scenery, Cascades, etc.-This parish is remark-
able for romantic scenery, and chiefly that part of it called
Glenalmon.  Near the West end of the fore part of the pa-
rish, the river Barvie runs through a deep den, where it
forms several small cascades.  The den is clothed with natu-
ral wood, and at some places 100 feet deep.  Near a mile
North from the place of Monzie, upon the river Keltie, there
is a remarkable den, with various cascades.  The uppermost
cascade, called Spout-bay, is in breadth at the top 5 feet; the
river falls over a smooth sloping rock, the height of which is
90 feet, and the breadth at the bottom 43 feet.  The river
then contracts into its former narrow channel, runs through
the thick wooded den, 150 feet deep.  Here there are some
other water falls, 5 feet wide at top, and 10 feet perpendi-
cular, with basons cut by nature out of the solid rock, one
of which is 12 feet diameter, and 9 feet deep.  At the
mouth of the den, the river seems to have made a path for it-
self in the solid rock, 6 feet in breadth at the top, and 10 feet
in height; the bason itself is 12 feet diameter.  From
this fall to the front of the rock is 24 feet; but the opening,
Out of which the river begins again to run, is only about 4
feet wide.  All the way from Monzie mansion-house to Spout-
Bay, along the banks of the river, there is a foot path made
and repaired by the family; at the top of which, on the side of
the den, and in full view of Spout-bay, there is erected a her-
mitage, for the reception of the admiring visitors of this cas-
cade.  About a mile above the village of Monzie there is a-
nother beautiful cascade, upon the river Shaggie; the breadth
