of them have been freighted to the Mediterranean, West
Indies, and America; and one is at present engaged by
Government in the transport service.
   At Wester Wemyss two ship-carpenters began to build
ships about seven years ago.  The situation is good, and
they have found great encouragement.  They employ
about 18 apprentices, and several journeymen.  Here some
of the best vessels which have sailed from the frith of Forth
for the West Indies have been built, as well as some for the
Baltic trade.  Other two ship carpenters have just begun
to build at Methil, a most convenient situation for the bu-
siness, and it is thought that they will meet with equal en-
couragement with the former.
   A gentleman in Easter Wemyss, who carries on a consi-
derable brewery, lately began to import wood from the
Baltic, which has been of great advantage to the neighbour-
hood; and from the rapid and extensive sale which he has
met with, cannot fail to secure benefit to himself.
   There are properly no merchants in the parish, with the
above exception.  Some persons sell a small quantity of
necessary articles; but as there are opportunities every day
of being provided with these at a cheaper rate from Kirk-
caldy, they meet with no great encouragement.
   The sea-weed on the rocks upon the shore is cut every
3 years, and yields about 100 tons of kelp.  The time of
cutting is in June and July.
   There are two good harbours in the parish.  One at
Methil, which was built by the Right Hon. David Earl of
Wemyss about the year 1650, solely at his own expence.
The other is at Wester Wemyss, but when built is un-
known.  It was some years ago greatly improved by a
bason for cleaning it.
