try abounds more with peat, coal, lime, and good quarries
of stone for building.  Were any remark to be made upon
the qualities of these; the coal does not seem to have equal
strength with that found in the deeper foils of the Lothians,
therefore burns for a shorter period, but that inconvenience
is sufficiently compensated by it abounding almost every
where along the tides of the water, its cheapness to the con-
sumer. and its accessibleness to all.  Perhaps the lime too
may be liable to the fame remark, and from the same cause;
bur the stone lies under no such exception.  It is of a pro-
per colour, and takes an excellent polish, being equally a-
dapted to conveniency or ornament.

   These are the local and natural advantages of this parish,
and they are no doubt considerable.  But it boasts, of later
other advantages, still greater in one respect, because they en-
hance its natural ones, give them value, and call them forth
into effect, I mean the manufactures lately established, and
which have been already mentioned.  The success of there
is an object truly desirable.  Every friend of his country
and of the public must, upon all occasions, wish well to lau-
dable and useful enterprise.  We respect, nay we praise, that
man who can improve or enrich the surface of the earth, can
mow down rich crops from fields formerly barren, or even
double the grains of corn, upon those that bore before.  But
surely an equal share of praise is justly due to that man, who,
in countries that are ungrateful to the labours of cultivation,
and either discourage or forbid its ungainful toil, can drag
from the sluggish bosom of the earth, in which they lie con-
cealed, inactive, and useless, those minerals, which under the
forming hand of art gradually assume every figure and every
shapes and serve at once to accommodate, or adorn life.
