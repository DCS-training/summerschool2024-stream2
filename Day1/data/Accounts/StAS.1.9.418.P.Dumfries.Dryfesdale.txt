     (COUNTY AND SYNOD OF DUMFRIES, PRESBYTERY OF
     LOCHMABEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr THOMAS HENDERSON.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Rivers, Soil, Climate.

   DRY'SDALE is obviously a corruption or contraction of
Dryfesdale; so called, from its lying partly on the
banks of the rivulet Dryfe.  The parish lies about the
middle of Annandale, and is in 550 08" N. Lat. and 30 W.
Long.  It is about 7 miles long, from N. to S.; at the
southern extremity only a mile broad; at the centre about
6 miles; and at the northern end 3; exhibiting a surface
of nearly 1100 acres.  The western and southern parts are
generally flat, and cultivated.  The upper or northern
parts are hilly, and mostly in pasture.  There is nearly one
half of the parish cultivated.  The Annan, dividing it from
Lochmaben, washes it on the W. and S. for upwards of
6 miles, abounding in rainy seasons with excellent salmon,
from the Solway Firth, to the supply of the Lockerbie,
