this lay dung and fine earth alternately; smooth the surface
of the dunghill; cover it entirely with a little earth to pre-
vent the sap being exhaled by the air, and keep it always
pretty broad above, that it may receive and retain as much
of the rain as may keep it from being too much located, or,
as we call it, fire-fanged, which would render it almost use-
less.  By this method of preserving the sap, it is evident
you may have your dunghill twice as bulky, and equally
fit for evey kind of crop, as you could have it it you ne-
glected this method.  The effect too of this manure upon
the land will be equally lasting with that of dung unmixed:
nay, upon a thin tilly soil, the fine earth, saturated with
the sap of the dung, is the best improvement that can be
invented; at least it is much better than lime itself, with-
out the addition of rich earth.-The holm of Dalry, and
some hard lands about the village, are possessed by the
seuars, who have been at great pains to enrich them with
manure, as otherwise the hard lands in general, though
warm and kindly enough, would have yielded no crops of
corn sufficient to repay the expense of seed and labour, not
to speak of rent; and even this holm, though naturally
the best land in the parish next to the holm of Grennan,
produces in general but a very poor crop without manure,
yet with manure it produces excellent crops.  To a curious
observer it is entertaining to fee in this holm the various
mixture of a soil, whose component parts are the same, viz.
clay and sand.  Here three varieties deserve special atten-
tion.  One is, where there is too much of the clay mingled
with the sand; another is, where there is too much of the
sand mingled with the clay; and the third is where the
two are so happily mixed, that neither of them is above or
under the due proportion requisite to render the soil fertile.
It is only on the spots where this happy mixture obtains,
that one may expect a good crop even without manure;
