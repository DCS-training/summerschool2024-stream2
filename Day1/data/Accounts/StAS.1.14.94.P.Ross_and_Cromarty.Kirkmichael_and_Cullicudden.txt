them to cold Highland grazings in summer, while they
have little natural, and no sown grass, to feed properly
such as are kept at home, their cattle and horses are of
a diminutive size; while an excellent breed and size of
both are reared on the extensive and highly improved
farms possessed by the residing heritors.  The sheep also
are very small, except on the above mainses, where the
Galloway breed has been crossed by the Cheviot, which
promises to answer, even beyond expectation, in in-
creasing the size of their body, and value of their wool.
Sheep pastured on the shore are generally healthiest
owing, probably, to their drinking salt-water, eating
sea-weed, and the grass which is flooded at stream-tides.
100 large sheep, well littered, are said to make a quan-
tity of manure fully sufficient for 5 acres.

ber of acres of which the other 4 estates are supposed to

at the exent of common belonging to the parish, and
therefore it is not mentioned:
