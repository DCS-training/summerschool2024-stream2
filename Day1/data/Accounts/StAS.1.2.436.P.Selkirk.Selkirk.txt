of James IV. on the plains of Flowden, a few returned, load-
ed with the spoils taken from the enemy.  Some of these tro-
phies still survive the rust of time, and the effects of negli-

the men of Hume, at a match of football, in which the souters of Sel-
kirk completely gained, and afterwards perpetuated, their victory
in that song.
