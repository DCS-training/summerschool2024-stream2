supposed to have been a Roman station.  It is circular in its
form, and begirt with ramparts, now cut into terraces.  Here
several articles of brass, and of ancient form, have been found,
such as weapons, bridle bits, chirurgical instruments, stili,
fibulae, etc.  Some of these being Roman, the rest have been
considered as such also; they are still to be seen at Penny-
cuick.  In a neighbouring farm is a tumulus, where several
urns, filled with burnt bones, have been dug up.  These cir-
cumstances led Sir John Clerk, who was well acquainted
with the antiquities of this country, to suppose that this must
have been a Roman station.  And, accordingly, the late Gene-
ral Roy has pointed it out in his maps, as the place where
the Romans passed the North Esk, in their way from the
South to Cramond.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Along the banks of the river is
a constant succession of gentleman's seats, many of them large
and excellent houses.  Melville castle in particular, the feat
of Mr Dundas, one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of
State, is a noble building, and suited to the exalted station of
its owner.  It was built a few years ago, on the scite of the
old house of that name; which, tradition says; belonged to
David Rizzio, and was occasionally inhabited by Queen Mary.
This tradition may have taken its rise from a circumstance
mentioned by Buchanan, that Mary, wishing to give her fa-
vourite an establishment in the country, and a seat in the Con-
vention, cast her eyes first of all on the lands of Melville,
and applied in the most earnest manner to the proprietor to
give them up.  But the historian adds, that the could not
prevail on him, and that she was much offended at the refusal.
