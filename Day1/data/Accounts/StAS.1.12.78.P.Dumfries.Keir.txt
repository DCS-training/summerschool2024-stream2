The school salary is 100 L. Scots, with a free house.  The
school fees are very trifling:  for teaching English 1 s. 3 d. the
quarter; writing and arithmetic 1 s. 6 d.  No Latin has been
taught here for many years.-The poor who regularly receive
alms from the kirk-session, are 6.  They are supplied from
the collections in the church on Sundays, and the interest of
a small sum appropriated to their use, amounting in all to
about 12 L. a-year.  They are all maintained in their own
houses.  They earn about a half or two-thirds of their own
maintenance; and none of them beg from door to door.  The

Cameronians; all the rest are of the Established Church.
There are 3 blacksmiths, 4 carpenters, 2 masons, 8 weavers,

   Number of Horses, Black Cattle, Sheep, etc.-There are
120 horses, mostly of the Scots breed, strong made, and very
hardy.  There are a few of the breed of Ireland, which gene-
