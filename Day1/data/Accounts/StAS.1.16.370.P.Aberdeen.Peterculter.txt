   From 1773 to 1783 the average of births is 21; from
1783 to 1793 the average is 16; but the accuracy of the
register cannot be much depended on.  From the best in-
formation, however, it appears, that this parish was more
populous 40 or 50 years since than it is now.  One reason
is, that 3 lots of the lands belonging to the town of Aber-
deen were feued, or given in fee, and a fourth lot was let
in lease to one tenant; on this lot the number of families is
reduced from 14 to 3; from 60 persons to 20.  On the lot
of Oldfold only one family resides; formerly it was inha-
bited by 5 or 6 families.  On the other two lots, Bingle
and Mains of Murtle, the number of persons and families
is much the same now that it was forty years ago.  On
Bingle there will be an increase soon.  Another reason to
be assigned for the decrease of population is this, many
young persons go to manufacturers and tradesmen in Aber-
deen and its vicinity; there, so many hands are employed,
and so great encouragement is sometimes given, that whole
families migrate thither at once.  This does now and then
happen, when a farmer raises the rent of his crofts, or when
any discord arises.  Hence it is, that on some farms we
find two or three cottages in ruins; and on other farms,
some cottages in ruins, and some of those which are stand-
ing, uninhabited.
   Of burials and marriages no register is kept.  The num-
ber of marriages is annually about five.  The number of
