of an appointment to supply Inchinnan pulpit occurs May 14th
1690, we may infer that the living was vacant by his death about
that time.  James Finlay was Wallace's Episcopal successor in
1665.  This gentleman was blamed * by his presbytery for irre-
gularity of attendance at its meetings, but defended himself by
giving reasons, and, what was of more importance, by producing
the license or dispensation of the archbishop.  Having been trans-
lated to another parish he was succeeded by William Stewart,
who, on June 27, 1667, appeared before the presbytery of Pais-
ley with a recommendation from the archbishop to have his trials
furthered.  Having passed these with acceptance, he obtained from
the presbytery that met on the 15th August, a testimonial to that
effect for the archbishop, in order to his ordination.  Mr Stew-
art's name appears for the last time in the presbytery record, 7th
September 1687.-John Stirling was admitted 7th May 1691.-Ro-
bert M'Auley, 9th September 1697.-Matthew Crawford, May 11,
1710, and was afterwards Professor of Church History in the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh.-Patrick Maxwell, May 3, 1722 ; he died 1749,
and was succeeded on the 3d February 1750, by Archibald Smith.
He died in 1760, and was succeeded in 1761 by Archibald Da-
vidson, D. D. promoted to the Principality of the College of Glas-
gow in 1786.-Thomas Burns was ordained his successor 16th
Feb. 1787, and was translated to Renfrew, 5th August 1790.  In
1791, William Hardie was ordained, but died in the subsequent
year.  William Richardson, D.D. was ordained in 1793; and he re-
signing the charge in 1822, the present incumbent became his suc-
cessor on the 18th August of that year.
   In Bagimont's Roll, the vicarage of Inchinnan was taxed at
L. 2, 13s. 4d. being a tenth part of its estimated value.  At the
Reformation, the vicar, Sir Bernard Peebles, reported that its re-
venues were L. 60 yearly, including all profits and duties.  In 1684
the incumbent declared to the Presbytery, verbo sacerdotis, that
the just provision of the kirk of Inchinnan was 7 chalders of
victual, but that he had never received more than 6.  The
living is at present augmented to 16 chalders, one-half meal the
other half barley, paid in money according to the highest fiar prices
struck in the county, with the sum of L. 8, 6s. 8d. as an allowance

<FOOTNOTE>Another complaint brought against some of the Episcopalian clergy in this
presbytery was the omission of the doxology, which was ordered to be sung every
Sunday.  It was argued in defence, that none of the people would join in such music,
and that the minister and precentor being the only performers, and sometimes both
of them alike destitute of a musical ear, the effect was bad, and the discord intoler-
able.  Still these pleadings went for nothing.  The archbishop stepped not forward
to screen the individuals who had been guilty of this species of delinquency.
