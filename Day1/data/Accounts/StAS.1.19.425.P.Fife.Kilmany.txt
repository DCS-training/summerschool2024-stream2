manner in which it is written here would lead any one, ac-
quainted with the Arabian Nights Entertainments, to ima-

there, were in other days circulated; reports which have had
often less to gain them credit, than the dismal gloom which
the shades of night must draw over that rugged unfrequent-

   Number of Acres, and Nature of the Soil.-The irregular
extent of the lands in the parish, already mentioned, in-
cludes, (besides a glebe of 9), 3963 Scotch acres.  Of these,
the soil differs according to their local situation.  In some
of the acres, which are farthest south, the soil is a strong
clay; in those forming the flat banks of the Morray, which
runs through the whole length of the parish, the soil is a
rich black loam, continued beneath the surface, beyond the
reach of the plough; in those which are extended on the
gentle acclivities, it is loam, with a gravelly and sometimes
a rocky bottom; and in the rest, the ground is cold moor,
on some spots covered with furze*.

the parish is in a state of high cultivation.-Of 3963 acres,
3216 are arable, the most of which commonly produce good
crops.  In raising these crops, there is no particular rotation

*There is also in the eastern comer of the parish a piece of light sandy
foil, which carries broom to the height of 6 or 8 feet; a produce of very
great beauty, and of some utility as fuel, but which takes such possession of
the ground, that to extirpate it is very difficult task.
