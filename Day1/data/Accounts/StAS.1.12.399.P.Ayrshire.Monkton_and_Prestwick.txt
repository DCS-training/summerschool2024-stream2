     Of Monktown and Prestick.

farmers generally use 3 horse, with a plough after the Eng-
lish form, and some use only 2 horses.  The usual time of 
sowing, is about the middle of March, and beginning of 
April; and bear or barley about the middle of May; reap-
ing in August and September; hay harvest in June and July. 
The manure used by the farmers near the sea, who have the 
privilege, is sea ware, remarkable for raising crops of sown 
grass, and crops of bear or barley; but does not meliorate 
above 2 years:  They also use lime, of which they have no 
quarries, but buy and drive at the distance of 3 or 4 miles. 
There are not above 3 freestone quarries in the parish, which 
increases the price of building considerably: and as yet, no 
coal-mines have been found; but there are appearances that 
indicate that such may be found in process of time, and will 
undoubtedly turn out to great advantage, as lying near the 
sea.  The quantity of natural wood, is 36 acres, besides large 
plantations.
   There are no rivers in the parish; but there are 3 rivulets:
1.  The Pow-burn, over which there is one bridge, on the 
toll-road leading from Monktown to Ayr, and another lately 
begun to be erected on the road to St. Quivox and Tarbolton. 
The other 2 rivulets are called Rumbler-burn, and Fall-burn, 
which all run into the sea, and in summer are most dry.
At present, there is only 1 mill in the parish for grinding 
grain, and another for flax, kept by the same miller.  Few 
are astricted to it, the farmers being at liberty to carry their 
grain to any mill they please, without being oppressed with 
multures, which are a great discouragement to agriculture. 
   The usual produce after milling oats, 19, 10, and 20
pecks the Winchester boll, now the standard meature of this 
country.  The amount of oats milled by the different farmers 
in Monktown and Prestick, by an account given by them-
selves in the year 1791, was 1315 bolls; and bear sold, and
