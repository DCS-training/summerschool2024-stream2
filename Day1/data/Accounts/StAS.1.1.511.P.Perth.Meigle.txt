     of Miegle.

   The proportion of persons who die at certain ages every year is
as follows, viz 9 below 3 years; 1 1/10 from 3 to 10; 2. 10-20;
2 4/10, 20-30; 2, 30-40; 2 3/10, 40-50; 5 4/10, 50-60; 3/5,
60-70; 3 5/10, 70-80; 1 from 80 to 90:  In all 31, or 1/37 of
the whole inhabitants.  The proportion of females to males
who die yearly is 16 to 15; the reverse of what is usually
stated in bills of mortality.  The proportion of births to deaths
is 38 to 31 nearly.

   The whole parish is divided among eight proprietors.  The
valued rent is L. 4200: 17: 2 Scots; and the real rent is
about six time that sum.

   Towns, etc.-There is no town or village of any note in
the parish.  Meigle, an antient, inconsiderable, meanly built,
market town, containing 2-1 inhabitants, is pleasantly situa-

rish, at the intersection of two turnpike roads, 12 miles N. W.
of Dundee, 6 1/2 N. E. of Cupar, and 5 1/2 S. W of Glammis. 
The weekly market is on Wednesday.  Annual fairs are held
on the last Wednesday of June and of October.  Meigle was
a village, and burying place, before the introduction of Chris-
tianity, as appears from some sepulchral monuments and tomb-
stones lately found in the walls of the church.

   Seats.-There are three seats in the most advantageous si-
tuations; and two of them are in good repaie.  Belmont
Castle, a modern edisice, stands on a gentle eminence, 204
feet above the level of half flood mark at Panbride, and com-
mands an extensive view of the plain.  Finished in the neat-
