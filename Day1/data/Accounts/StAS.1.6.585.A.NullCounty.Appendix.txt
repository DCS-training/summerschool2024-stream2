upon this mound, every day.  This is a work unrivalled by
any but Alexander the Great's at Tyre*.
   The extent of Edinburgh at present is as follows.-From
the west end of Fountaion-bridge, to the east end of Abbay
Hill is above two English miles.  From Broughton on the
north to the Grange Toll bar on the south, is about two Eng-
lish miles.-The circumference, by the report of a Gentle-
man who walked round it with a view to ascertain this point,
is as nearly as he could estimate, seven English miles.
   In 1786-The valued rents of houses in Edinburgh, which
pay cess or land tax, were more than double what they were
in 1763; and in 1791 they were more than triple+.

*The height of this mound, from the surface of the ground, which was
formerly a lake, is at the south end 92 feet, and at the north end 58 feet.
The quantity of earth that appears at present above the surface, measure,
292,167 cubical yards; and, it is moderate to say, that half as much is below
the surface.  This makes  the mound, as it stands at present, 435,250 cubical
yards of travelled or carried earth.  Then, allowing three cart-loads to each
cubical yard of earth, there must be 1,105,750 cart-loads in this mound.  It
began by the megathrates accommodating the builders in the New Town with
a place to lay the sabbath, and this noble and useful communication cost the
only the expense of spreading the earth.  Had the city paid for digging
and driving the earth, it would have cost them L. 32, 643: 15 Sterling-suppo-
sing the destroys cartiage, and driving a lwo 2 s 6 d. per cart-load.  It is not
yet neatly completed to its full breadth.
