its kind.  How few have philosophy or fortitude enough
to live in a style inserior to their neighbours and equals!
When all are equally poor, none but spendthrifts are ever 
in distress.  As the wages of labour are more than doubled,
the manner of living is entirely changed.  Until about the
year 1760, the working people used no bread but oat cakes.
Since that time, however, the use of wheaten bread has 
been increasing; and now, bread made of oat meal is not to 
be met with, but in houses of gentlemen as rarity.  At
the period before mentioned, working people used little 
meat but falted mutton in winter.  Salt herrings too made
great part of their kitchen, (opsonium), a word that here 
signifies whatever gives a relish to bread or porridge; the 
last of which is not yet in difuse, but still continues, with
milk or ale, to make the breakfasts and suppers of children
and apprentices.  Through the year fresh or new killed
beef is now substituted for salted.

   Markets.-There is a market for butcher's meat in
Musselburgh every Friday, and one in Fisherrow every
Tuesday.  There is a much greater number of animals
killed here, then are consumed in the parish, to the amount 
of some hundreds of sheep weekly in the season, and a 
proportional number of black cattle, lambs, calves, and 
hogs.  But they are chiefly for the supply of the markets
of Edinburgh and Leith, which are frequented by our but-
chers.  From this it may be inferred, that our provisions
are equally good with theirs, excepting some choice beasts 
that must fall to the share of the Edinburgh butchers.  Veal
too must be excepted, which is rarely good here, and has 
lately degenerated.  Our pork, which is chiefly purchased
from the farmers of East Lothian, is remarkably fine; and 
our lamb is superior in quality, as the butchers have inclo-
sures at hand, in which they are kept till they are wanted.
