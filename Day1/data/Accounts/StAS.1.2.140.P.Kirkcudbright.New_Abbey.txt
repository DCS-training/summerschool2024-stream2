   Means by which their Situation might be meliorated.-
The means of bettering their situation seem to be chiefly
these, 1. Taking high duty off English coals; as much time,
labour, and expence are consumed in cutting, winning,
and carting peat, which operates as a great discouragement to
manufactures and agriculture.  2. Purchasing the multures,
and relieving the farmer from so very heavy a tax on the pro-
duce of his fields.  Most of the lands here pay 1/13 of all the
corn they grind, to the proprietor of the mill, besides the mil-
ler's dues of manufacturing, and they also pay 1/19 of all grain
sold.  The particular hardship of this last tax is, that it ex-
tends to wheat, though the proprietor never has had a mill fit
for grinding it.  It is, however, but justice to the present
proprietor, to observe, that an offer has lately been made to
all the heritors of purchasing their respective multures, at pri-
ces which do not seem to be unreasonable.
