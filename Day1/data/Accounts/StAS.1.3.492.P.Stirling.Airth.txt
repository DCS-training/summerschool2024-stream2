   Decline of Trade.-The trade in Airth, prior to the year
1745, was very considerable, but has since on the de-
cline, owing to a number of vessels being burnt at that pe-
riod.  The occasion of this was, that the rebels, having
feized a small vessel at the narrow part of the river, called Fal-
llin, by means of it transported a number of small brass can-
non to the harbours of Airth and Dunmore, near each of
which they erected batteries, and placed their cannon.  Up-
on the King's vessels coming from Leith to dislodge them, a
reciprocal firing took place.  The commanders of the King's
vessels, finding their efforts ineffectual, failed down the river
with the tide, and gave orders to burn all the vessels lying
on the river side, to prevent them falling into the hands of
the rebels, who might have used them as transports, and har-
rassed the people on both sides of the river.  The loss of
these vessels were severely felt by the trading people in Airth,
and trade has since removed top Carronshore and Grange-
mouth.
