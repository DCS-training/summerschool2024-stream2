is shipped at a commodious harbour, which the Earl of
Morton has lately built for the purpose.   It is a stone of
a strong and superior quality.  It is used at Carron for
smelting.  It is also disposed of in shells, or flacked.  The 
shells are put on board at 1 s. 0 1/2 d. the boll, and the stones
at 2 s. 8 d. the ton.

   Coast.-The parish stretches along the shore above two
miles.  From the east boundary the coast is rugged and
sleep, and generally covered with wood to the water's edge.
The trees have been planted with a proper regard to the
variety of shade, and the jutting rocks which appear in
different places, render the whole extremely picturesque and
beautiful.  This wood is intersected with walks cut out on
the face of the hill, from which the prospects are rich and
varied.  On the west, there is a beautiful white sandy bay,
surrounded with trees.  Here the grounds rise gently to
the west, bordered by thriving plantations; and stretching
southward, they terminate in a perpendicular rock washed
by the sea.-By this rock on the E. and by headlands on
the S. W. the small harbour of Aberdour is well shelter-

few small vessels.  There is one ferry-boat to Leith, which
is principally employed in carrying grain.  The shipping
here, as in most towns on the coast of Fife, was formerly
much more considerable than at present.  To the N. W.
of this harbour, the ground again rises into a little hill, co-
vered with trees, above whose tops an obelisk yet appear;
beyond this, some corn-fields stretch to the western boun-
dary of the parish on the coast.  The prospects to the south
are beautiful.  On the right hand lies the island of Inch-
colm, with the ruins of its monastery.  On the lest ap-

seated on the sea.  The islands of Inchkeith, Cramond,
