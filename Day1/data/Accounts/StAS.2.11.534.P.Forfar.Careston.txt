also here two men in robes, on each side of the arms, and on their
flanks two others in armour, in the Highland costume, with helmets
and coats of mail, with their hands folded.
	In the western bed-room, are the arms of the Earl of Hadding-
ton, with the motto above, "Praesto et Presto."
	In the bed-room, west wing, are the arms of Balthayock, with
the motto above, "Virtute Tutus."

strument, the Highland bagpipe, instead of a coat of arms, above
the mantel-piece. And in the same situation, in another bed-room,
there are the figures of two peasants dressed in short tunics, each
with a flail in his hand, two sheaves of corn laid across one another,
and rakes and corn forks beside the men.
	Although the Castle of Careston cannot boast much of orna-
ment in its construction, it is, on the whole, a stately edifice,
and carries in its appearance an aspect of grandeur, well stited
to a baronial residence.
