     of Montrose.

   At the harbour of Montrose, there is a good wet dock,
where ships are built and rapaired, not only for this, but
for other ports.
   In 1783, a plan was adopted, and patronised by several
gentlemen and merchants of Montrose, for insuring ships and
goods at sea.  It has been carried on ever since.  As there
is also in this place a branch of the office at Dundee, for in-
suring houses and funiture against fire, most of the proper-
ty, belonging to the inhabitants, may be insured in the town
itself.
   The port of Montrose, which comprehends within its
bounds, all the coast, from the Tod-head on the north, to the
lights of Tay on the south, had, in 1789, the following 
number of ships, and quantity of tonnage belonging to it.
