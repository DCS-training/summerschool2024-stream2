the deep gloom of the Scotch, or the gayer verdure of the
larch-fir.  The small proportion of wooded ground, in com-
parison of what may be wooded, has been in part removed
by considerable plantations lately made on the estates of
Lochmalony, Mountwhannie, and Myre Cairnie; and it is
to be hoped, that a few years will fill the melancholy blank,
which the eye, in wandering over this parish *, finds upon
its mountains.

   Tithes.*-The tithes of the parish, with the right of pre-
sentation to the living, were given to the College of St Sal-
vator, in the University of St Andrews, by Bishop Kennedy,
the founder of that college. They were intended to be a 
valuable donation; and would have been so in a high de-
gree, from a parish in such a state of cultivation, had they
been allowed to keep pace with the progress of agriculture
and the price of corn.  This was not allowed; and they
have now shrunk out of all proportion to the real rent.  The
Principal and Professors of the United College, since the
union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's, have received them,
and are titulars of the tithes, and patrons of the parish.

   Fuel, etc.-In the ordinary articles consumed for the
support, or for the comfort of life, the inhabitants of this
parish may be abundantly supplied.  But the supply cannot
be procured at low prices.  Coals, in particular, must both
be purchased at a high rate, and brought into the parish by
tedious or difficult roads.  In the county of Fife, no coal
pits have as yet been opened to the north of the river Eden;
hence no coals of any kind can be brought hither over land
by a shorter road than six miles, and none good by one less
than 16 l and it is no easy matter to convey them from the

their attention.
