   The number of deaths, in the two last years, was owing to
the natural small pox.

   Rent, Proprietors, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 3629 Scots, the real rent probably more than L. 3000.
Some of the lands in the parish are let at 5 s and 7 s 6 d. an
acre; some at 40 s; and some of the lands around the town,
at L. 4 sterling.  There are 10 heritors in the parish, and a
great number of portioners, possessing what is called Burgher
lands, holding of the town.  Three of the greater proprietors,
either occasionally, or constantly, reside in the parish.  There
is neither a surgeon nor a writer residing in it, a circumstance
which is not much to be regretted.

   Crops.-The chief crops are oats, barley, wheat, and pota-
toes.  There is also a considerable quantity of clover and rye-
grass sown every year, which, in general, answers extremely
well.  Potatoes are a great crop, particularly round the town,
and there is a good market for them at Paisley.  The soil is
exceedingly favourable for them, being a deep rich loam, upon
a bed of sand: Seventy-two bolls of very fine potatoes, have
been produced on an acre.
   Though the ground near the town has enjoyed no rest, in
the memory of the oldest man living, yet still it bears good
crops of every kind.  They crop it, as long as the produce
is tolerable, then they trench it; and in this way they go
on.
   Oats are sown in March or April,-barley in April or May,-
and wheat generally in October.  The glebe last year was sown
in November, after sallow, and the wheat on it was as early, and
as good as any in the country.  In general, the wheat round
the town, and indeed in most places of this country is sown
