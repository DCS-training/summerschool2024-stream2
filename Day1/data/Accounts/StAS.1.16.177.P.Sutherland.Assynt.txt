   Maul-elan-an.-These are two islands attached to the farm
of Culkin-Drumbaig; they are a little nearer the coast of
this parish than that of Edra-chilish; they lie in that broad
part of Kills which runs in a direct line betwixt Culkin-
Drumbaig and Loch-bad-ca-ul*, a fine harbour close by the
manse of Edra-chilish.  To there islands sometimes old
sheep are sent to fatten, or lambs to be speaned.  They
are of no great extent.  They are not to be approached
but when a fair and calm day offers, by reason of the bil-
lows and broken surges, which violently wash their bold
and rocky shore.

   Island Oldney.-This island, the best on the whole coast,
the eastern end of it lies so near the mainland part of Old-
ney farm, by reason that the breadth of the channel divi-
ding them will not exceed 20 yards; this also is the channel
formerly mentioned by the Gaelic name of Dorny-elan-
aul-da-ney, having a harbour on each side of it.  The
length of it will perhaps measure an English mile; the
breadth varies much in many places, and where broadest,
will probably not exceed a quarter of a mile.  Its insular
situation makes it valuable, as its pasture and little corn is
safe from being trespassed on by neighbouring cattle; be-
sides that it answers in its turn, with other grazings, as
part of the milch cow pasture throughout summer.  During
the harvest months, no bestial is allowed to enter it, being
all that time preserved for out wintering pasture.  Cattle
are put in there some time in November, (as into all other
winterings), are thence gradually taken out to be housed
the beginning of spring, as they may appear to need pro-
vender.  Some cattle are loft yearly as they attempt get-
ting to little plots of grass among high rocks, with which
