     Statistical Account

pleasant companion, but crafty and slippery statesman, George
Mackenzie, first Earl of Cromarty, whose numerous works
are well known, 5th, John Law of Lauriston, Comptroller
General of the Finances in France, one of the most extraor-
dinary characters that this or any other country has produ-
ced, to whose great merit and abilities sufficient justice has
not yet been done. 6th, George Cleghorn, an eminent phy-
sician in Dublin, the first person that established what could,
with any degree of propriety, be called an anatomical school
in Ireland. 7th, William Cleghorn, who was associated with
his uncle George, just now mentioned, as Professor of Ana-
tomy in Trinity College Dublin, but died soon afterwards in
1783, at the age of 28, universally regretted.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are 2 coaches, and 4 four
wheeled chaises in this parish; 7 licensed ale-houses.  The
corruption among the lower classes, says the Rev. Mr Bonar,
the minister, is mournful; as perhaps in few country parishes,
the liberties and vices of the town are any where more accu-
rately copied.
