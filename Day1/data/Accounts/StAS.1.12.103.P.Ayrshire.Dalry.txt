ny as one horse can draw.  A chalder of lime, or 80 Win-
chester bushels, is generally got from 4 such carts.  Farmers
generally burn their own lime for the use of the farm.  Lime,
when bought from those who prepare it for sale, is got for
6 s. 8 d. for the farm, and, when prepared for building, at 8 s.
the chalder.  Owing to the plenty and cheapness of lime, a free
use is made of it by farmer, this being the only manure that
can be come at, as no dung can be bought, and no marl as
yet discovered, so as to become of general use.  Peat also a-
bounds in many parts of the parish, so that many farmers pro-
vide themselves with such large quantities, as to depend almost
wholly upon it for fuel.  Peats, when sold, are at 14 d. or
15 d. the cart; and the cart is so constructed, as to hold a large
quantity, no measure being in use for such an article.  They
who live at a distance from the moss, provide only a small
quantity.  Peats are generally employed in heating of milk
for cheese-making, and in drying all kinds of grain for the
mill.  There is plenty of iron-stone in several parts of the pa-
rish, but none of it as yet wrought.

   Manufactures.-These are mostly confined to the village.
Some years ago, when the silk manufacture flourished, there
were above 100 silk weavers in the village, besides a few in
the country part of the parish; and these were generally em-
ployed by the silk manufacturers in Paisley or Glasgow.  But
now the number of such weavers is greatly reduced, and cot-
ton weaving has become the chief trade of the place.  I have
been at some pains to find out the numbers of men, women,
and children now employed in the different branches of silk
and cotton working; and they are as follows:
