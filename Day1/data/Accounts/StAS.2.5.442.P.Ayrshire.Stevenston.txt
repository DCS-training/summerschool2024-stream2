on their respective properties, Mr Reid Cuningharne, of Auchen-
harvie, being the sole manager. One of the first operations of this
enterprizing and succeessful manager, was to improve the har-
bour of Saltcoats, and to form a canal from the coal-field to the
harbour, a distance of more than two miles. In those days this
was no small undertaking, but it was accomplished, and the
canal navigated in 1772, being the first on which business was
done ID Scotland. It would lead us greatly to overpass our limits
to trace his proceedings; but the best proof of the judgment and
spirit with which he acted is, that, for some years previous to his
death in 1814, the profits shared by the partners were from
L. 2000 to L. 6000 a-year.
	Subsequent to the death of Mr Reid Cuninghame of Auchen-
harvie, Mr Beaumont acted as manager for the Company, for ten
years. For the last ten years, it has been under the management
of Mr Croker, who has carried on the extensive operations that
were necessary, with great skill, steadiness, and success. The
quantity of coal raised from Stevenston colliery during the year,
ending 29th October 1836, was as follows:--

The coal is generally shipped at from 8s. 6d. to 10s., and at pre-
sent 12s. 6d. per ton of 28 cwts., and sold in Dublin, Belfast, &c.
from 12s. 6d. to 16s., and at present, 20s. per ton of 20 cwt.  The
small coal or culm, at from 4s. to 5s. 4d. per ton, is sold for the
salt-works or lime-burning.
	The coat strata in this parish extend from Irvine harbour, and
the river Garnock on the east, to Saltcoats harbour on the west-
ern boundary of the parish; and, no doubt, extend a great way
under the sea. They are intersected bv several dislocations, the
direction of which has been fully ascertained. The chief of these
dislocations is a true mineral vein or dike, composed of green-
stone of a very close texture, intermingled with numerous spots
of a light green-coloured spar. It is known by the name of the
Capon-craig-gaw, and is distinctly seen rising above all the other
strata, on the north side of the town of Stevenston. Its general
line of bearing is 11&deg; west of north. This dike is about 16 yards

<FOOTNOTE>About 28 cwt. to the ton.
