     NUMBER II.

     PARISH OF HOLYWOOD,

     IN DUMFRIES-SHIRE

     Minister of that Parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   HOLYWOOD is evidently derived from the holy wood,
or grove of oak trees, which surrounded a large Drui-

church.  It is formed of twelve very large whin or moor
stones, as they are called, which inclose a circular piece of
ground of about eighty yards in diameter.  The oaks have
now all perished; but there is a tradition of their existing in
the last age.  Many of their roots have been dug out of the
ground by the present ministers; and he has still one of them
in his possession.

   Situations, Extent, and Surface.-The parish lies in the division
of the county of Dumfries called Nithsdale, in the Presbytery
and Synod of Dumfries.  It is about ten English miles long,
and one and an half broad, on an average.  It is bounded by
the parish of Dumfries on the east; by Terregles, Kirkpatrick-

part of Glencairn, and by a large track of Dunscore, on the
west and north; and by Kirkmahoe on the north-east.  Be-
