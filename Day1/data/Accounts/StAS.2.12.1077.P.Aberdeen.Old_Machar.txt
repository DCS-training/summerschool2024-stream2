                              IV.-INDUSTRY.
         Agriculture.-Extensive improvements have, of late years, been
effected in the way of reclaiming waste lands on the property of
the late Colonel Gordon of Parkhill, by Messrs Nicol, Reid
(Leuchlands), Craighead (Mindurno), Simpson (Cranbay), and
others. One of these active farmers, Mr Nicol, received a pre-
mium, a few years ago, for his improvements from the Highland
Society. Much credit is also due to the late Colonel Gordon,
the proprietor.
	The real rental of the parish is not known; but the valuation,
at allocating the schoolmaster's salary per decreet of the Commis-
sioners of Supply, 2d February 1758, was L.10,882, 11s. 4d.
Scots. Where no valuation cess-books was attainable, the Com-
missioners affirmed the valuation at one-fifth of the then real rent.
         Fishings.-Salmon-fishing is carried on in the Don, but princi-
pally by stake-nets in the sea.
         Manufactures.-Cotton-spinning is carried on at Grandholm
Haugh by Leys, Masson, and Co.; thread-spinning and weaving
at Gordons mills, by Milne, Cruden, and Co.; and at Printfield,
by Gordon, Barron, and Co.; and bleaching at all of these places
for their own goods; flax-spinning, weaving, and bleaching, at
Broadford and Rubislaw, by Richards and Co. All of these ma-
nufactures are carried on to a considerable extent.
