     Statistical Account

   Rivers.-None of the rivers are large, nor is it possible to
render them navigable; the channels are often rocky, and
very uneven; in some places deep, in others shallow.  Great
quantities of small stones, or of sand, are carried along by eve-
ry flood, so that the depth is perpetually varying; and the
rivers frequently shift their beds.  The flat meadows on the
banks of the Briarachan are frequently overflowed, and, in
winter, often covered with water.  A fall on the river
Tummel, called the Lin of Tummel, about 8 feet high, is
remarkable only for the quantity of water, and the force
with which it is thrown over the rock; and for affording a
convenient pool for catching fish.  The only lake is Loch
Broom, situated in a hill on the confines of Moulin and Lo-
gierait parishes.

ish.-The rivers contain trout, eel, par, minnow, but of
no superior quality.  Loch Broom has abundance of trout,
superior in size and flavour to the river trout.  These kinds
of fish are caught with the rod for sport, or for the use of pri-
vate families, but never for sale.  Salmon are found in the
Tummel and Garry; the fishing continues from the begin-
nigh or middle of March, to the middle of August.  The fish
are almost all bought up for the London market, at 6 1/2. d. or
7 d. the lb. till the first of May; then at 4 d. or 4 1/2 d. the lb.
The salmon are most in  season in the middle of spring, and
degenerate through the summer months.  They are caught,
for the most part, with net and bait; sometimes with a kind
of spear, armed with three of five prongs, barbed at the
point, which is plunged into the fish, while it lies motionless
in still water.  Somtimes they are taken in a kind of large
wicker basket, placed so as to intercept their progress up the
