actions, are of late years almost obliterated among the pre-
sent generation.  Both men and women about 60 years a-

They were strangers to every complaint of a nervous na-
ture.  This arose from the hardy manner in which they
were brought up from their infancy, and being accustomed
to watch their cattle without doors in the night during the
whole summer and harvest season.  From the above au-

ment at present, it gives the most flattering prospects of
their future progress in the course of time.  The greatest
danger to their present progress is the raising the land to a
racked rent, which industrious tenants may be unable to

   Church, Stipend, School, Poor, etc.-The church and

slightly finished at first  The glebe, including the seat of
the manse and garden, consists of 7 acres of very good land,
at an average, worth about L. 1, 5 s.  Sterling the acre.
The stipend is the smallest in this corner, being only L. 58,
