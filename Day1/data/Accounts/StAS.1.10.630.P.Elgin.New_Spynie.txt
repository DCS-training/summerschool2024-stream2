upon the health of the inhabitants, no disease being more
prevalent here than in any other part of the country.-This
parish is bounded on the S. throughout the greatest part of
its length, by the river Lossie, excepting that opposite to the
town of Elgin there is a fine field of about 40 acres, called
Brrough bridge, which belongs to this parish, though on the
south side of the river: The reason of this is, that the Loffie

are rented by gentlemen, turnips and gown grass have their
places in the rotation of crops; but, on the smaller, none of
the modern improvements in agriculture have yet been a-
dopted*.  Every farmer, however, raises hay, the soil being

*Thirty years ago, neither turnips nor potatoes were known
in this parish, except a few in gardens.  The principal farmers
have now both in abundance in the open fields, and partake of
the profits of these useful productions.  Grass seeds, such as
rye-grass and clover, were equally unknown 40 years ago.  A
few families of rank, in the neighbourhood, began to raise grass;
