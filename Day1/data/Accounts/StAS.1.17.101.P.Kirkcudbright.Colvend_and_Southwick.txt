the country up the water of Urr; which is 2 miles broad at
its confluence with the frith, and is navigable from thence
about 8 miles by vessels of 80 tons burden.  This navigable
river, about 2 miles from in mouth, forms within land a large
bason, commonly called Gibb's Hold, into which large vessels
are often obliged to put, in stormy weather, where they are
well sheltered and safely moored.  The water of Southwick
is a smaller stream, which falls into the frith towards the east
end of the parish, and also affords a convenience for impor-
tation of lime; being navigable for near 2 miles by vessels of
small burthen.  The navigation, however, of the Solway Frith
is every day becoming more difficult and hazardous, by the
large sand banks which lie in its channel, on which many
shipwrecks happen; and which within these few years hard

out towards its mouth seeming to threaten, at no very distant
period, to shut it up altogether.

   Climate, and Diseases.-This part of the country, enjoying
a free circulation of air, a warm dry soil, and, like all other
rocky countries, many springs of excellent water, might be
expected to be more healthy than it is really experienced to
be.  Excessive falls of rain, brought by violent southerly and
south-westerly winds, blowing in from the neighbouring At-
lantic, have of late years been severely felt here; and have
probably contributed to the frequency of flow fevers, fluxes,
catarrhs, and consumptions, but above all to rheumatic com-
plaints, which universally prevail here.  In autumn 1772, the
infection of a malignant fever was communicated to this pa-
rish from abroad, and made great havock: It was 3 years
before the infection was quite extinguished.  The sudden and
loud gusts of south-westerly winds, several of which have been
experienced in this part of the country, uncommonly violent
