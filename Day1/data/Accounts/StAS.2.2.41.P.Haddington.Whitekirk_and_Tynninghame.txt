houses of their own, sufficient to lodge, and funds to maintain their
poor. These houses, eleven in number, still remain, and are oc-
cupied by widows, who, together with their houses, get each of
them a small allowance of coals. The ground on which the houses
stand, and the gardens behind them, were originally given by the
Earl of Haddington. There is generally more than one applicant
when any of these houses become vacant; and there appears some-
times too great a willingness, even on the part of healthy, young, and
vigorous persons, to obtain an establishment in the Widow's Row.
   Fuel.-The principal families in the parish import their coal,
the only species of fuel used, from Fife; it is conveniently landed
at different places on the coast; and is preferred, though dearer,
to that which is brought from Gladsmuir or Tranent; a distance of
fourteen or fifteen miles. In consequence of the difference of price,
however, the inhabitants generally supply themselves from the in-
land collieries. A ton of Fife coal, carriage included, costs at the
centre of the parish about 16s. The same quantity from the
nearest inland coal-bill would cost about 12s. The poor find their
interest in picking up the broken and decayed branches in Lord
Haddington's Woods, to which they have at all times free access.
   There are but two alehouses in the parish; and they are said
to be necessary for the public convenience.
