Seaforth borders on extravagance; and those who know them,
allow that their temperance and frugality merit imitation.  It
deserves to be remarked among the peculiarities of this parish,
that no male or female comes under the contemptible appella-
tion of a drunkard; and also, that there is not a M'Kenzie re-
sident, or possessor, in the place, though it has been the property
of that name for many generations.

   Cattle, Sheep, etc.-The chief production is black-cattle;
on which account is has got the name of Kintail no Bogh, or,

that the intermixed progeny infects the whole flock with
braxies, and other unknown distempers.  The price of a goat
is 6 s.-and of a wedder, 8 s.
   There are about 300 horses in the parish.  Ploughing and e-
very fort of labour is carried on by them; but they are never
allowed to pasture with milch-cows in summer: for them, the
benty grass of the mountains are reserved.  The plough with
