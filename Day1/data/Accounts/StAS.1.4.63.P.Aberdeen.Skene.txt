Aberdeen, may be assigned as the cause; by which last, 31
ploughs have been reduced to 14; but the rents have con-
siderably encreased, and a spirit of improvement has been
excited.  The situation of the parish in 1782 and 1783
was, as I have been informed, every wretched; and had
not the peace, at that critical period, taken place, a fa-
mine, it is believed, must in this country in general, have,
inevitably ensued.  The pease, which had been bought up
for the use of the fleet, were imported in great quantities
in Scotland; and this supply, along with the laudable ex-
ertions of communities and individuals, proved, under Pro-
vidence, the means of saving the country.
