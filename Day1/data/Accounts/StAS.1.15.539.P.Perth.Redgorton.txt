The Viscout Stormont, now Earl of Mansfield, is patron.
   The present incumbent was settled in 1763.  His imme-
diate predecessor was George Fraser, now minister at Monei-
dy, who succeeded to George Meek, whose predecessor was
George Blaky, who was the first minister settled after the
Revolution, and succeeded-Achterlouny, who carried off
all the public records in his time, as well as those that were
more ancient; and since, no account of the ancient poor's
funds has ever been recovered.
   The heritors of this parish, are, the Duke of Athol, Lord
Methven, Colonel Graham of Balgowan, and Mr Drummond
of logiealmond, none of whom reside.
   The funds for maintaining the poor are small; they arise
chiefly from seat rents in the church, the weekly collections,
and a small assessment of ten or fifteen pounds yearly, the
one half paid by the heritors, the other by the parishioners.
The poor here seldom exceed eight or ten in number; and
a sum not exceeding thirty pounds is sufficient for their sup-
port, as well as for defraying all the expences of the session
clerk, etc.  The poor get from two to six shillings monthly,
and, before winter, a few coals and cloaths when necessary.
From half of the collections, which the Session is allowed,
to dispose of at pleasure; the money from the mortcloths,
and the fines, the poor children, who are not on the
parish list, are educated, get books and cloaths.  When
any extraordinary calamity falls out, there is a collection
made for the purpose, which is generally liberal.  There
have been no beggars or travelling poor here for these thirty
years, ever since the present incumbent was settled.  There
is one parochial school; the salary is no more than one hun-
dred merks Scots; the number of scholars is from fifty to
one hundred.  Besides this, there are two private schools,
one at Stanley, the other at Cromwell Park.  There are
