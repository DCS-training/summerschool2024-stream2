     Comparative Population of South Knapdale.

   No documents are to be found, whereby the general po-
pulation of South Knapdale, at any former period, can be
exactly ascertained; nor are there any records of births,
marriages, and deaths, from which conclusions of that kind
can be drawn.  The compiler of these has selected out the
farms in which the greatest variation has happened, and ob-
tained lists of their former inhabitants from tenants pos-
sessing them at the time specified:
