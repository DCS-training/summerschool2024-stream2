     APPENDIX, No. III.

     On the celebrated draught of Salmon in the River Thurso.

   In the preceding Statistical Account, Chap. II. Sect. I, mention was
made of the celebrated draught of salmon in the river of Thurso, when no
less a number than 2560 were caught.  That circumstance has been often
mentioned, but seemed incredible to many, who were not acquainted with
the circumstances attending that event.  With a view of having the fact
ascertained, the following certificate was given by three persons, who wit-
nessed the transaction, and are of unquestioned veracity.

   "We, George Paterson, now bailie of Thurso, George Swanson, shoema-
ker there, and Donald Finlayson semor, fisher there, do hereby certify and
declare.  That upon the 23d day of July, Old Style, we think in the year 1743,
or 1744, there were caught, at one haul, in the Cruive Pool, upon the water
above the town of Thurso, two thousand five hundred and sixty salmon.
These fish were caught by a large net, beginning the sweep at the cruives,
and coming down the stream to a stem at the low end of the pool.  The
net was carried down the water by from 18 to 20 men, with long poles in
their hands, keeping down the ground rope, and the fish were afterwards
taken ashore, by degrees, in a smaller net.  Each man got a fish and some
whisky for his trouble.  We farther certify and declare, That we were per-
sonally present when these fish were caught.
