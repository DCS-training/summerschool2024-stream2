     of Dunblane.

prevailing in the district to the north of this parish.-The
bridges on the Allan are good.  There are no less than 6
upon it, 4 of which are within the parish.  The Bridge of
Dunblane, and the other bridges upon the public road, are
kept in repair by the statute labour and conversion money.

   Fuel.-The greatest part of the inhabitants use coals,
brought from pits in the neighbourhood of Alloa, at the
distance of 10 or 12 miles.  Many of the farmers still use
peats dug in the moors.  But the great length of time spent in
working them, and the moderate price of coals, have induced
the greatest number to use this last as most comfortable, and,
upon the whole, the cheapest.

   Manure.-There are several pits of excellent shell marl in
the parish; and plenty of lime, by water carriage on the
Forth, is to be got at the distance of a few miles; and it is
much used in improving the grounds.

   Woods.-In this parish there is plenty of coppice wood and
other kinds, such as oak, elm, beech, plane, etc. besides
many plantations of firs.

   Plane at Kippenross-This plane is supposed to be one of
the largest trees in Scotland.  Its dimensions are:
