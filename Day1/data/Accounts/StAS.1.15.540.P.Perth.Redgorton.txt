three public roads which pass through this parish, and very
near the manse: the great road from Perth to Dunkeld,
which is a turnpike, that from Dunkeld to Balgowan, Ster-
ling, etc; and the third from Perth to the West Highlands
through Glenalmond.  About twenty years ago, the an-
nual wages of a man servant, were from four to five pounds,
now from seven to ten; and of a woman-servant, from
thirty to forty shillings, now three or four pounds.  A day-
labourer then thought himself well paid with eight pence,
now he demands one shilling, and can scarce be hired at
any rate.  The people in this parish, are very industrious,
unless it be strangers, on their first coming from distant parts,
who soon acquire the decent manners of this country.  Con-
siderable attention is paid to the morals of the people at the
public works, particularly at Loncarty, where the manu-
factures have been established for forty years.  When the
young folks of either sex, are suspected of too much inti-
macy, the young man is called before his master; and if he
refuses to marry the lass he professes to love, he is imme-
diately dismissed from the work; but if he marries, which
is generally the case, he gets a house and garden, and a small
compliment.  The only feuel made use of here is coal, which
they either bring from Perth, or from the pits.  If the last
is the case, they set off with their carriages about midnight,
and arrive at home the next evening in the twilight.

   General Observations.-I shall conclude this history with a
few general observations respecting the police of the coun-
try, and the improvement of the livings of the clergy in
Scotland.
   If the gentry could be induced to attend the worship of
the established church; if the churches were rendered more
comfortable, and the roads and avenues leading thereunto,
