and acquaintance.  This evil is now happily removed.  A re-
spectable lady, who, in this and other acts of charity and bene-
ficence, proceeds according to the rules prescribed in
the gospel, has supplied the parish with a missionary; and
has it in contemplation to build him a comfortable house,
and a genteel chapel for Divine service.

   Poor.-The number on the roll is not great.  There is
no fund but what arises from the weekly collections, out of
which two serries are paid for the use of the poor.

   Quadrupeds.-The number of black cattle and horses is
on the decrease; but the breed is improving.  England regu-
lates the prices of them.  Besides other domestic animals,
the parish abounds with deer, roes, hares, foxes, badgers,
otters, wild cats, and pole-cats.  Squirrels are also found in
the woods of Glen Ainaig.  It may be added, that the Frith
abounds with seals, to the great prejudice of the salmon fish-
ing.

   Birds.-Besides the several domestic kinds, there are a
great variety in the fields, woods, hills, and waters; such as
the wood and mountain thrushes, linnets, black birds, star-
lings, finches of all kinds, field-fares, curlews, wild geese,
herons, swans and ducks of various sizes and colours.  Birds
of prey also abound, viz. eagles, hawks, ravens, kites, and
hooded crows.  There are some singing birds of a most
beautiful plumage, the names of which the incumbent is not
acquainted with.  There is one species, remarkably small,
and of a pale sand colour, which is distinguished for the
strength and sweetness of its notes, and sings during the
night.  By way of ironical contrast to its size, and in com-
pliment to its pipe, it is called the Giant of the Wood.
