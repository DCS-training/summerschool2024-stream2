duced prices, which contributed much to the relief of the
parish, during the scarcity which then prevailed.

   Miscellaneous Oservations.-The parish, as was before ob-
served, extends along the Forth about three miles; and the
banks are in many places so beautifully skirted with trees,
and diversified with such a variety of prospects, both of na-
ture and art, as present many scenes truly picturesque and
sublime.  There is also a small loch at Otterston, about a
mile from the coast, which for its situation is universally ad-
mired; on its banks stand three gentlemen's houses, two of
which are still inhabited; and it is so surrounded with rising
ground and trees, as to furnish a pleasing miniature scene.
There are few antiquities in the parish, and concerning those
which are, such as the remains of what is supposed to have
been a camp, a Druidical temple, and one of those marks
commonly called a Standing Stone, there is no consistent tra-
dition, nor certain account.  The house of Donibristle was
formerly the residence of the Abbot of St Combe, but it has
since been greatly enlarged and improved. Opposite to the
eastern extremity of the parish, and within a mile of the shore,
is the island of St Combe, the description of which, and of
the monastery upon it, have been given in the Statistical Ac-
count of the parish of Aberdour.  The Earl of Dunfermline's
seat formerly stood at a little distance from the church of Dal-
gety, but little of it now remains. The church itself is a very
ancient building.  The exact period of its erection cannot be
ascertained; but there are documents which show that a
grant of the ground on which it stands, was made to the
Abbot of St Combe, as far back as the 14th century.  Ad-
ditions however have been made to it, which bear the marks
of a later date.
