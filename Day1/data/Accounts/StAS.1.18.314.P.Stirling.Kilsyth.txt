   Disadvantages.-But while we enjoy many advantages, and
are abundantly sensible of it, we labour under a few peculiar dis-
advantages, though I trust we are grateful to heaven that they
are so few and small.  A few of these disadvantages I shall
shortly enumerate.
   1st, It is doubtless a considerable loss, that none of the
principal heritors reside in the parish.  All classes and denomi-
nations, but especially the poor, must feel this.  The tender
nursing hand of a liberal landlord, is to them, a mighty blessing.
   2d, But it is not only those who feel the loss.  The parish at
large, but especially the town, have cause to regret, that there
is not within the parish a single justice of the peace, commis-

that the smallest petty offence, or outrage, cannot be redres-

parish.
   And what is still worse, every idle, worthless vagrant,
who can find shelter no where else, is apt to resort to this
as a place of refuge, where he may skulk about and pilfer with
impunity.  Amazing crouds of sturdy beggars infest us at all
times, especially in harvest, when all the males are at work
in the field.  At that time they not only crave a rea-
sonable alms, but often enforce their unreasonable de-
mand, by frightening the peaceable and industrious inhabi-
tants.  If there be any evil which calls for redress in this
place, this is one; and to redress it is surely not impossible.
   3d, It is likewise a loss to this parish, that we have no week-
ly market.  The peasant and manufacturer, whether in the
town or country must feel this.
   4th, The farmers labour under a few inconveniences.  But
