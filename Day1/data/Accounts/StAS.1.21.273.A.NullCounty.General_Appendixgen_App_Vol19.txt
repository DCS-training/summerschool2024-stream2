among whom the veteran soldiers fought with uncommon
bravery; but almost all the horse escaped, by a well-timed,
but inglorious flight.  Of the Covenanters, the most eminent
persons slain, were, Campbell of Lawers and Sir John and Sir
Gideon Murrays.  Montrose lost, on the left wing, only one
private soldier, and on the other, where M'Donald command-
ed, 14 soldiers; but there were many more wounded.  Mr
Shaw, (History of Moray), mentions M'Pherson of Invereschie
among the slain on the side of the Royalists.  This battle of
Auldearn was fought May 4th, 1645.-Spalding's remarks
on this engagement are characteristical his age.  'It was
'miraculous, and only foughten with God's own finger, as
'would appear; so many to be cut down on the one side,
'and so few on the other: yet no thanks was given to God
'for this great victory.'
   After this victory, Montrose gave directions to burn the
lands and houses of Campbell of Calder in Nairn, and plun-
der all his goods.  The Earl of Moray being in England, his
ground was plundered, also that of Kinsterie and Lethen,
and several other lands in the county.
