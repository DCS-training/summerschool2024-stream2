   It may be here remarked that no very extraordinary in-
stances of longevity, well authenticated, have occurred of
late in the parish.  A man who died lately at the age of 97,
and a man and woman both at the age of 94, are the only
instances worthy of notice.
   The inhabitants are collected into 368 families, so that
there are nearly 4 1/3 persons in each family.  As marriage is
not discouraged either by a deficiency of the necessaries of
life, or by an excess of its luxuries, the number of those who
continue unmarried after the usual age of, entering into that
connection is comparatively very small.  This will more di-
stinctly appear from the following statement; to which it
may be premised, that had the number of unmarried persons
been taken from those above the age of twenty five, as would
perhaps have been more proper, it would probably have been
very considerably diminished:
