conceived being on too large a scale, and improvements and
manufactures being then in their infancy, the design was laid
aside.  The utility and practicableness of a canal between
Perth and Forfar will appear from the following remarks:
1.  The whole extent of its course would be about 36 miles,
through a tolerably level and fertile country.  2.  Its greatest
elevation, at the eastern extremity, would not exceed 220
feet above the level of the sea.  3.  A channel 15 feet broad,
and 6 deep, with recesses at certain intervals, and 22 locks,
might be sufficient.  4.  From the higher grounds many ri-
vulets and small streams descend; and by these it would be
amply supplied with water.  5.  The nearest port towns are
Perth and Dundee, distant 12-18 miles.  6.  From those
places, coal, lime, foreign wood, and merchandise, are at
present conveyed by land carriage.  And cloth, barley, etc.
are transported thither in the same way.  7.  An extent of
country, 35 miles long, and 6 broad, containing upwards of
20,000 inhabitants, would derive essential benefit from a
canal.  Useful and practicable, however, as the plan may ap-
pear, the situation of the Strath, with regard to the port towns
already mentioned, and the expence to be incurred, will, it
is to be feared, for ever prevent such an undertaking from
being carried into execution.  For the sum requisite to the
construction of a canal cannot be estimated at less than
L. 28,000 or L. 30,000; nor the land carriage of 22 pa-
rishes in its neighbourhood at more than L. 1100 per an-
num.  A vessel might convey by water 50 tons; that is, as
much weight as 125 horses could carry by land from Perth
or Dundee.  But, unless the water carriage were rated at
7 s. 6 d. per ton, competent interest could not be had for
the original sum expended on the canal; and, if the car-
riage by water were so highly rated, the greater part of the
inhabitants would rather convey their commodities by land.
