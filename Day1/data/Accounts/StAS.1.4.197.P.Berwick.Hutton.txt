trout, the last of which are carried to London alive, in
wells in the Berwick smacks, and weigh generally about
3 lb.  Ten boats or cobles are the highest number allowed
to be kept on this side the river, in the parish.  The sal-

of the fishing waters is upwards of L. 200 a year, and about
12 men are employed.  The tide flows to Norham castle,
which is 10 miles from Berwick.  A boat of 30 tons can
come up the river to New-water Ford, which is 6 miles
from Berwick.-There is great plenty of moorstone and
freestone on the banks of the Tweed and Whittader, most
excellent for building, and of a fine white colour.  The

flooded, when there is any remarkable fall of rain or snow.
