ecclesiastical constitution they enjoy gives them such peculiar op-
portunities of obtaining.
 The Committee are well aware that errors and defects are insepa-
rable from a work of the nature and extent of the present; and
they doubt not that this necessity (for, in effect, it is nothing less) will
be duly considered in any estimate of its merits. They would only
suggest, as among the causes of any imperfection that may be obser-
ved, - the want of a system of accurate registrations throughout the
country, and the little opportunity which many of the contributors
could enjoy to make the necessary investigations concerning the
history of their parishes. They would notice, too, as the occasion
of a certain disadvantage, the unusual number of individuals con-
tributing, and the consequent inequality in the execution of the
parts; were not this diversity, at the same time, the cause of a
great part of the peculiar interest which, they hope, may be assumed
as attaching to the work. Above all, it will be remembered
that a Statistical Account  of any country implies something more
than the mere reporting of ascertained facts; and that it can-
not be accomplished, in all points completely, without great and
various labour in the ascertainment of the facts to be reported, -
by the scientific survey of its physical qualities, by inquiries into
its past history and situation, and by the close investigation of its
actual state, industrial, social, and moral. It was with such mul-
tifarious preparation that the Ordnance Survey of Ireland pro-
ceeded in compiling their admirable Memoir of the Parish of
Templemore. But the same method could not be followed, to the
same extent, in the present undertaking; which was unaided by
the public funds, and has been supported throughout by no
other means than such as might be expected to be returned in the
event of its success. It may be added, that the same condition of
entire self-dependence necessarily affected the plan of the work;
which, it is readily admitted, would have been, in some respects,
different under favour of other circumstances.
 In announcing the completion of the undertaking, the Commit-
tee desire gratefully to acknowledge how much its progress was en-
couraged by the interest which the General Assembly, at the com-
