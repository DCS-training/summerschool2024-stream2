		I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Latitude and Longitude.-The latitude of the Academy of
	Perth is 56/d 23 40 N., and its longitude 3/d 26' 20" W. As
	a subject intimately connected with geographical position, it may
	also be mentioned, that the magnetic variation was 26/d 54' W.
	in November 1836. In 1815, when the magnetic north seemed
	to have attained its furthest range to the westward of the true north,
        the variation was 28/d 10' W.; hence the annual diminution seems
	at present to be about 31/2; but as the changes of all variable magnitudes.
	when near the maximum state, are smaller than the mean
	rate of change, the decrement will probably become more rapid
	till toward the close of the present century.
          Name.-The etymology of the name is uncertain. Lord Hailes
	in his Annals, says, the he had been favoured with different interpretations
	of the word, and that not knowing which to choose, he
        had omitted them all. Fordun, in his Scotichronicon, tells us,
	that he had found in some ancient writings that the town was formerly
	called Bertha. The names of many places in the neighbourhood
	are of Celtic origin. The vernacular language of the
	people not many miles from Perth, is Celtic, at the present day.
	Bhar-tatha is a Celtic word, and signifies the height of Tay. Thus
