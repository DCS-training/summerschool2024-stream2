church by the minister for many years, and the schoolmasters in
the villages continue to teach Sabbath evening-schools.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.--The poor are well provided for in
this parish, as besides an aliment, many of them have house-rents
paid, and frequent occasional supplies. The number permanently
on the roll, is from 15 to 18, who receive from 2s. 6d. to 6s. per
month. There are also from 5 to 8, who occasionally get assist-
ance for clothes, fire, &c.--liberal donations being given for these
purposes in winter by the families of Tillicoultry and Alva. There
have been two or three lunatics, or persons in a state of mental im -
becility, supported by the parish, at great expense, for some years.
Besides the collections at the church-door, averaging for 1835,
1836, and 1837, L. 26, 11s. 103/4d.; mortcloth dues &c. from L.2
to L.3; and the interest of L. 203 at 5 per cent; the heritors, for
some years past, have found it necessary to assess themselves to
defray the above heavy expenditure.
   Inns and Public-Houses.--There are ten public-houses in the
parish; and there is no doubt that our Saturday evenings would be
more quiet and our Sabbaths more solemn, were fewer opportuni-
ties afforded the thoughtless and the dissipated of injuring their
health and morals, and exposing themselves to all the evils which
drunkenness entails.
   Fuel.--Abundance of excellent coal may be had, at no great
distance from any of the villages, from 4s. 6d. to 6s. per ton, ac-
cording to the season and the demand.

   September 1841.
