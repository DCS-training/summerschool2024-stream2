hands upwards of two hundred years ago. He has neither manse
nor glebe, nor any allowance for them. The Earl of Rosslyn is
the patron of both charges.
  Large and increasing though the population of Dysart be, there
are no Chapels of Ease attached to the Established Church. But
about thirteen years ago, seven or eight individuals connected with
the village of Pathhead, agreed to erect a place of worship at
their own expense. It cost about L. 3000, and they have no re-
turn for their money but the seat rents, which are far from being
an adequate remuneration. The house was opened in November
1823,-ever since which time the ministers of Dvsart have preach-
ed in it, and dispensed the ordinances of religion, without asking
or receiving any emolument. The building is neat and elegant;
it is ornamented with a spacious tower, and is seated for 970 persons.
  There are two dissenting chapels in the parish, the one belong-
ing to the synod of Relief, and the other to the Antiburghers. The
Stipend of the irninister in the Relief chapel is very small, and that
of the Antiburgber does not exceed L. 100 yearly. Both are de-
pendent for their livings upon the seat rents, and the Sabbath days'
collection made at their church doors. These cannot amount to
much, when it is considered that the usual congregation in both
places Aoes not exceed 800 or 900 people at most.
  A few years ago the parish was divided by authority of the Pres-
bytery, so that each minister has now a district tinder his own im -
mediate superintendence. In the east division, which includes the
town of Dysart, the villages of Gallaton, Boreland, and the coun-
try part of the parish, the state of matters with respect to the
Church is as follows:

  The number usually attending the parish church is from 1200 to
1360; and at PathheaA it is about 600. There are about 1800
names on the communion roll; but of this number not more than
600 or 700 communicate in the parish church, at each sacrament;
and not more than 400 at Pathhead.
  There are several religious societies in the parish, viz. a Bible
and Missionary Society, which occasionally gives part of its funds
to the Gaelic and Hibernian Societies; a Sabbath Evening School
Society; and a Society for the Education of Children. This last
