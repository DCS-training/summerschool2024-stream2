prevent the concealment of property, and the abuse of public cha-
rity.  The poor of the borough are provided for in a similar way.
Assessors are appointed in different parts of the town, who meet
before Whitsunday, and having examined the number and circum-
stances of the poor, fix the assessment for the next quarter.  The
sum requisite for the other three quarters is fixed by the magis-
trates.  The sum to be paid by each individual is proportioned
not merely to his ostensible property, but to the supposed profits
of his trade and other apparent advantages.  Both in the town and
in the country, an interim supply is given in case of diseases or
temporary distress.  The distribution of parochial charity has un-
doubtedly been productive of injurious effects, diminishing the spi-
rit of independence, and repressing the feelings of natural affec-
tion and gratitude.  The assessments last year for the country
poor amounted to L. 462, 9s. ; for the town poor to L. 430 ; in all,
L. 992, 9s.

  The gaol and bridewell are both well secured, being surround-
ed with high walls surmounted by chevaux de frise.  The prison-
ers are divided into classes.  Those convicted are kept separate
from those confined previous to trial, males from females, and young
offenders from old, and to each class a particular division of the gaol is
appropriated.  There are spacious courts, which afford the means of
obtaining air and exercise, and proper attention is paid to the diet,
cleanliness, and health of the prisoners.  There is not, indeed, a
more comfortable place of confinement in Scotland.  The gaol
and bridewell are superintended by a gaoler and a turnkey, under
the inspectior of the sheriff and of the magistrates of the borough.
    Fairs.--The royal charters of the town of Jedburgh entitle it
to hold four annual fairs, the first on the first Tuesday after Whit-
sunday, the second, or Lady-day, on the second Tuesday of Au-
