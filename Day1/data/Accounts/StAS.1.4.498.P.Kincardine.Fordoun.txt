     Antiquities.-About 3 years ago, when inclosing a field
near this place, was discoverd an earthen urn with ashes in
it, in the centre of 4 large stones, with a flat stone on the
top.  The urn, when exposed to the air, and touched
mouldered into dust.  It was probably a Roman urn, as at
about a mile's distance from the place where it was disco-
vered, there are still the vestiges of a Roman camp.  The
wall and ditch, which surrounded the camp itself, are scarce-
ly discernible in many places, having been taken into the
adjacent corn-fields; but the wall and ditch which surround-
ed the praetorium are very distinct, which shew it to have
been an oblong square.-In the west end of this parish at
Kincardine, not far from Fettercairn, are the ruins of a ca-
stle, said by tradition to have been once a Royal palace, be-
longing to Kenneth III. where he sometimes resided.  It is
conjectured by some, that he was making a progress from
this castle to Fordoun, to worship at the shrine of St Palla-
dius, when he was killed by Finella in the manner related
by Buchanan.-Not far from Kincardine, and near to the
Grampians, is a mount called Green Castle, by some
thought to have been the residence of Finella, by others
supposed to have been only a place of safety or retreat for
the depredators, who frequently came down from the
Highlands to carry off the cattle belonging to the inhabi-
tants of the low country.  This last conjecture is the most
probable.  That Finella had her residence in this neighbour-
hood is highly probable.  The hill which runs between
Fordoun and Kincardine has the name of Strathfinella.
