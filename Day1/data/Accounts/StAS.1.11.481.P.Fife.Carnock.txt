either are not arable, or have not been tilled within the me-
mory of man.  There are pretty considerahle plantations of
wood on the lands of Clune and Pitdennies, chiefly fir, with
some ash and larix trees intermixed.  In Luscar Dean (or
Den) there are several pleasant walks among the trees, with
very romantic scenery; and upon the banks of the rivulet,
near the village of Carnock, there are some trees which have
flood these 52 years, and afford a refreshing shade during the
heat of summer.

   Climate and Diseases.-The air is rather damp in winter
and spring, but in summer it is abundantly salubrious.  Epi-
demical distempers are more rare in this, than in some of the
neighbouring parishes.  The most common complaints are
coughs and rheumatismd, which prevail most in winter and
spring.  Fevers and fluxes are rare.  The small-pox general-
ly visits the parish once in 3 or 4 years.  The 4 last returns
were in 1780, 1783. 1787, and 1789.  That of 1787 was by
far the most fevere, when 15 children out of 45 died of that
distemper; and that of 1789, the most favourable, when only
three died out of 63; and, of these 3, one at least was in bad
health before.  In 1780 and 1783, the medium of deaths was
from 4 to 6 each year, though a great many had that disease.
Inoculation has as yet made but little progress, though the
prejudices of the common people, against that salutary prac-
tice, seem to be subsiding.

   Agriculture, Crops, Export, etc-The rotation of crops is
much the same here as in other parts of the country.  After
rye-grass, oats, sometimes repeated, then pease and beans, then
turnips or potatoes, or fallow and lime, succeeded by a crop
of wheat.  There seems to be a seventh part of the arable
land in fallow and turnips, and about a seventh part under
