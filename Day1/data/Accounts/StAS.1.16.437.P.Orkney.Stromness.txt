   Village of Stromness.-This village, situated on the west
side of the harbour, near the southmost extremity or ness
of this parish, from whence it derives its name, was, in the
beginning of the present century, very inconsiderable, con-
sisting only of half a dozen houses with slated roofs, and
a few scattered huts, the first inhabited by two gentlemen
of landed property, and two or three small traders; the
last by a few fishermen and mechanics.  Two small vessels,
