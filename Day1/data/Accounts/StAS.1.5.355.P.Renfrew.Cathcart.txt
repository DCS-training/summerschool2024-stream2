   Probable Improvements.-With regard to the means by
which the situation of the inhabitants of this district may
be improved, we shall consine our attention to those who
are employed in labouring the ground, who are the most
numerous.  The misfortune of the tenantry here, as well
as in many other parts of the country, is, that having no
capital, they possess not the means of bringing their farms
into that complete state of improvements, of which we ap-
prehend, they are capable.  The produce is barely suffi-
cient for supplying the demands of each season; for paying
their  rents, and procuring for their families the necessaries 
of life; for, to luxuries, or even convenieces, they must 
not pretend to aspire.  Beginning in poverty and depres-
sion, they must necessarily remain to, and, at the end of 
their lease, their land returns into the hands of the pro-
prietor in no better, but frequently, in a wose condition 
than it was before. It ought, therefore, to be the study of 
country gentlemen, either to look out for tenants who 
have a stock, and to give them sufficient encouragement, to 
employ it in meliorating their lands, or previously to put 
them into such a situation, that they may reasonably ex-
pect an advanced rent.  It is apprehended, that whatever 
expence, (especially in such a situation as this,) might
thereby be incurred, would turn out to good account. 
One very obvious improvement , required in this country, 
is building better houses to the tenants, in which there is 
still a very lamentable deficieny.  The contract in this 
respect, between this class of men, and those employed 
in the manufacturers, must strike every observer. Be 
sides the tendency, which this improvement would have, 
to preserve the health of the inhabitants, and to enable 
them better to endure the fatigues of their occupation, it 
would raise their spirits, place them upon a more respect-
