                             III.--POPULATION.
	In 1801, the population amounted to 966, there being 456 males and 511 females.
           1811,                           1016,             478           538
           1821,                           1085,             519           566
           1831,                           1232,             573           659
	Of these there were, by the schoolmaster's memoranda, under
fifteen years of age, 441; between fifteen and thirty, 347; between
thirty and fifty, 268; between fifty and seventy, 145; and above
seventy, 31. The yearly average of marriages may be stated on
the same authority at 10. Neither the births nor the deaths can
be given with perfect accuracy, for the reason assigned in the re-
port formerly quoted.
	The population is scattered over the parish very irregularly.
About 570 belong to the villages of Penpont, Burnhead, Townhead
of Penpont, and Brierbush. Indeed, with the exception of Burn-
head, which is within half a mile of the Nith, the other three may
almost be considered as one village with its suburbs. There is a
tendency in the village population somewhat to increase its rela-
tive proportion to the country part of it. His Grace the Duke of
Buccleuch is understood to be inclined rather to the system of hav-
ing large farms, and of erecting substantial, buildings with all ne-
cessary and suitable accommodations, than of subdividing them,
and having numerous cottars attached. Some cottages upon his
estates, that had become ruinous, have not been rebuilt; and of
course, their former occupants have found their way into the vil-
lages.
	The number of illegitimate children born within the last three
years may be stated at 4. And it may likewise be of importance
to state, that there are probably not more than three fatuous per-
sons in a population of 1261.
	Language, Customs.--There can be no doubt,that society here
has made considerable progress in intelligence within the last forty
years; and that the language of the inhabitants has participated in
the general improvement. Yet to one not a native of Nithsdale it
perhaps would seem that modes of expression are employed indi-
cative of greater antiquity than in the adjoining districts,--than in
Ayrshire for example.  One often bears, even from men of intel-
ligence and education, of the Parochin of Penpont. And no mode
of expression is more common than to use but for without. It
would be injudicious, however, to record other peculiarities of idiom,
which, in the rapid course of intellectual improvement in the pa-
rish, may soon themselves become obsolete.
