mers mind little else but their cattle; the women, besides
their ordinary domestic affairs, are employed in providing
coarse cloths for the family, and spinning linen yarn to the
manufactories.
   Nevertheless, with all these peculiarities of climate and
customs, the tenants, especially within the four hills of Ca-
brach, are in good circumstances enough for their rank, and
are thriving.  Nature seems to have intended the country
more for pasturage than agriculture; aware of this, the inha-
bitants pay their attention chiefly to sheep and black cattle.
Early in the spring, they stock their little farms with the for-
mer, and, about Whitsunday, with the latter.  During the
course of the summer, they are ever buying and selling at
home and in markets.  About the end of August, they clear
their towns, if the sale is brisk, of all except as many as they
have provender to support in the winter: If the market has
been bad, they keep more than their usual number, and buy
corn and straw for them in the neighbouring parishes-By
these means they seldom meet with much loss, nor indeed can
it ever be great; their stocks are small, and the circle of
their trade but narrow, of course, the little speculation that
is here, depending merely upon the appearance of a good
grass crop, or a demand from the south, is seldom attended
with bad consequences, even if the crop should happen to be
short.  Accordingly, one year with another, they replace the
capitals employed in this trade, with a small profit, deducting
all charges.
