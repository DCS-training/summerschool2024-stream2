100 L. Sterling was lost by a failure.  Besides the interest of
the above sum, the collections made on Sabbath, with mort-
cloth money, marriages, &c. may amount to 12 L. Sterling,
annually.  There are no travelling poor belonging to this
parish, though there is no want of such from other parishes;
a practice which ought not to be tolerated in a well regulat-
ed state, as it extorts from charitable people, even against
their own judgment, part of what they would otherwise be-
stow with more pleasure and advantage among the residing
poor, whose characters and circumstances are known to them.
