   Rent.-The rent of houses is in proportion to their situa-
tion and convencies.  The land contiguous to the town,
on the east and south, is in the parish of Inch, and belongs
to the Earl of Stair; that on the south-west and west to Mr
Vans Agnew, and is in the parish of Lochswalt.  It is di-
vided into small inclosures with turf sences, to accommodate
the inhabitants, and is let at various rates, from 20 s. to 2
guineas an acre.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Two villages, Clayhole and Hill-head, belonging to the
parish of Lockswalt, are so closely joined to Stranraer, being
separated from it only by an ideal line, that they may be, and
indeed Item are, considered, especially by strangers, as part of
the town.  They contain about 500 inhabitants.
