to be made with any conducting surrow, to carry off the
water, which are always made with the spade.  All there
open communications are here called gaas; and to keep
them perfectly clear is a very essential part o, every Carfe
farmer's attention.  It is as yet a general practice in the
Carfe to have head-ridges, as they are called, at the two ex-
tremities of each field; i. e. the ground upon which the
plough turns is laid up in the shape of a transverse ridge,
higher in the middle, and falling off at each side; to that a
gaa is made in the course of the inner furrow, as at f f f f,
with which the whole furrows between the longitudi-
nal ridges communicate, and into which they pour all
their surface water, which is carried off by similar gaas, or
openings, cut through the head-ridges, at convenient distan-
ces, as at g g g g, and by which the whole is emptied into
the adjoining ditches, c c c c, and by them into the main
drain.
   It is supposed that it would be a much better plan, in-
stead of forming head ridges, as above described, to lay the
earth up to the ends of the longitudinal ridges uniformly,
which could easily be done with a little more trouble, by
returning with an empty plough.  There would then be no
depression between the longitudinal and transverse ridges,
of course, no occasion for a gaa; and by cutting fairly
through the head ridges opposite to every longitudinal sur-
row, a freer passage would be given to the surface-water
from the whole field to the adjoining ditch, and, of course,
the draining be more complete.  This method Mr Paterson
has followed upon all the fields which he has levelled, and
which is represented by the FIG. 2.
   Besides all these, an experienced Carfe farmer will take
care that his ground is carefully ploughed; that the land is
laid up equally; that no inequalities are left, so as to hold
water; that the ridges are properly rounded, neither too
