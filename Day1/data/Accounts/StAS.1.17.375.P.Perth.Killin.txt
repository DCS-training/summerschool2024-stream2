3 to 4 after the grain sown; barley and pease from 3 to 5;
potatoes from 10 to 16; and flax from half a stone to a stone,
after the lippy of feed.  Owing greatly to the scarcity of in-
closures, turnips and sown grass are little cultivated in the
parish, except by a few gentlemen, with whom they answer
well, and who derive much benefit from them.  The harvest
usually begins about the middle of August, and the crop,
except in very wet and cold seasons, is secured by the end of
September or beginning of October.

   Price of Grain and Provisions.-The grain produced in
this parish itself is never sufficient for supplying its inhabi-
tants with that article.  There are, besides, some hundred
bolls of meal imported into it annually.  The average price
of oats here is 12 s. of bear 16 s. and of potatoes 4 s. per
boll.  Oat meal is ordinarily sold at 16 s. and bear meal at
12 s. per boll; but in the years 1782 and 1783, oat meal
sold here at 1 L. 3 s. and 1 L. 4 s. per boll; and the different
crops failed so far, in this and the adjacent countries, in
these two seasons, that the natives of this parish had been
much at a loss for meal at any price, were it not for some
pease meal brought from the south, which served greatly to
relieve their distress.  The price of beef, mutton, veal, and
pork, is generally regulated by the prices of our cattle mar-
kets, being about 3 d. per lib. of 17 1/2 oz.-Butter is 9 d. per
lib. of 22 oz. tron weight.-Cheese varies in its price, ac-
cording to its richness and age, being from 5 s. to 7 s. per
stone of 22 lib.

   Price of Labour.-The price of all kinds of labour is
greatly advanced here of late years.  The wages of men la-
bourers are 1 s. a day from the 1 ft of March to the 1 ft of
November, when they furnish their own provisions.  Men
