while ploughing a field which has been long arable, found the
plough striking against a stone, which be resolved to remove, and
on proceeding to do so, discovered that it formed part of a paved
road of considerable width, the extent of which has not yet been
ascertained. Near to the spot where it was laid bare, there is a
hollow, which is known by the name of the Picts' Howe, with
which it is supposed to be somehow connected. In removing part
of the stones formiting the pavement, numerous pieces of charred
wood were found lying beneath them.
	There are no resident heritors in the parish, and the only man-
sion-house is that of Blelack, which is at present unoccupied.

			IV.-INDUSTRY.
	In few districts of Scotland, perhaps, has agriculture made
greater progress than it has done in this parish, since the former
Statistical Account of the country was published.  At that pe-
riod, we are told, that few turnips were sown, and clover and rye-
grass cultivated only on three farms. The other lands in the pa-
rish, though capable of improvement, are said to have been " in a
state of nature." The farms at that time, so distinguished for en-
closing, straighting, and dressing, can no longer boast of superiority
of appearance or peculiarity of produced for skilful and successful
competitors have gradually sprung up around them, and stripped
them of their honours.
