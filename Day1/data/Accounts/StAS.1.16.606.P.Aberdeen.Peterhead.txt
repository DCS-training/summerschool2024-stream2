their health, and persons of every kind may find con-
venient lodgings.  Two cold baths, a room where the com-
pany may assemble to drink the water, a large room for
dancing, a billiard-room, and other accommodations, have
been built by the society of Free Masons, and are to be
found in the Keith Lodge, immediately contiguous to the
well, which was erected about 30 years ago.  They are at
present employed in adding to the lodge an hotel, with a
large suite of bed-rooms, for the accommodation of the wa-
ter-drinkers; and which, by being separated from the New
Inn only by the high-road, and immediately opposite to
it, will be found extremely convenient, and, it is hoped,
agreeable to the company who resort to this place.
   The New Inn was originally built by the late Earl of
Errol, from a desire to promote the interest of this town,
and for the accommodation of the water-drinkers.  A great
number of houses, where elegant lodgings may be found,
have been erected by many of the inhabitants, merely with
a view to accommodate strangers.  There is only wanting
a warm bath, and a bathing machine on the sea-beach.
   The company deserve every encouragement, as the mo-
ney left by them in summer is very considerable.

   Buildings.-Were a person, who had resided in Peter-
head about 30 years ago, to come here for the first time
since that period, he would be very much surprised with
the present appearance of the town, both as to its size, and
the improvement in the style of building.  Several acres
which were under the plough, contiguous to the principal
street, have been feued, and are now decorated with some
of the best streets and houses in town.  One acre, which
at that period yielded from L. 1 to L. 1, 10 s. Sterling of
rent, would now produce nearly L. 150 Sterling for house-
rent.
