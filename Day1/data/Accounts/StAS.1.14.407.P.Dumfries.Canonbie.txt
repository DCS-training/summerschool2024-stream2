     NUMBER XXIII.

     PARISH OF CANOBY.

     (County AND SYNOD OF DUMFRIES, PRESBYTERY OF
     LANGHOLM.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JOHN RUSSEL.

     Name, Situation, Extent, etc.

   THE ancient priory in this place seems to have
given name to the parish; Canoby being most 
probably derived from the Latin cocnobium, which signi-
sies, a priory or monastery, and comes from the Greek
nolvos, common, and Blos, life; in allusion to the monks 
living in common.  This idea is considerably strength-
ened from the circumstance, that a piece of land, grant-
ed by donation to this priory, and specially* designed
in a charter confirmed by King William the Lion in
1165, is to this day called Canoby-holm, to wit, the 
Priory-Holm, in distinction from Bec-holm, Knotty-
