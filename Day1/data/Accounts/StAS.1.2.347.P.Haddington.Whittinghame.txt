ly, will be about 100 feet, and on that of Whitewater, about
150:  on the south side, the ground is nearly level, to some dis-
tance from the fortification, and then rises gradually up to the
summit of Priest-law.  The camp is of an oval form, with
the broadest end, which inaccessible, towards the north.
On one side are four ditches, parallel to each other, and the
distance, between each, may be 12 yards.-On the
north side are three ditches, and the outer ditch is carried
round the whole.  The circumference of this military work
will measure about 2000 feet.-In one place, on the north,
the rock is cut in a slanting form, down to the bed of Whitta-
ter below; and, it is probable, that, through this passage, the
camp was supplied with water.  There are three gates or en-
tries, one on the south side, which is 40 feet wide; another
on the east, and the third on the west, which are 20 feet wide
each.  It is probable, that this fortification was constructed by
the Scots, the English, or the Danes.

   Sheep.-The pasture, in this part of the parish, is only
fit for breeding sheep.  The farmers, therefore, every year,
sell as many of them as they can part with, to the graziers,
in the low country, who carry them to their rich pasture, and
fatten them for the butcher.  The number of sheep, kept on these
farms, exceeds 300 scores in summer, but is much smaller in
winter.  The farmers, of this district, bring annually to the
market, about 1700 stone of wool.  This commodity has sold,
for the three last years, at from 6 s. to 8 s. 6 d. some at 9 s. 
per stone.  The average is from 7 s. to 7 s.3 d. per stone:  14
years ago, the average would be about 6 s. 9 d. or somewhat
less; but in 1782 in did not exceed 4 s.  What would now
bring 6 s. was not then worth more than 2 s. per stone.
   The farmers, in this part of Lamer-moor, sell annually,
at an average, about 30 score of ewes, and about 60 or or 65
