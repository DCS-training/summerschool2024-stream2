no great extent.  The district southward of the church, forms
a portion of the elevated ridge already mentioned, which,
with little interruption, extends from Perth, east-north-east,
to Red-head, a promontory on the coast of Angus.  The
acclivity of those hills fronting the north, is in some places
improved, and in others yields tolerable pastures: but the
summit is every where covered with short heath, Dunsin-
nan hill excepted.
