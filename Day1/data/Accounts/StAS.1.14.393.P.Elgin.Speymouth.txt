at the river side is 4 1/2 d. the lb., which is thought very
high.  The sending of salmon fresh in ice to London,
is but a late discovery, and adds greatly to the value of
our salmon fishings, as the fish fetches a much higher
price in this way than in any other.  Mr. Richardson
of Perth is said to have the merit of introducing this
practice.  The fishing is carried on with small boats,
called Cobles, with 8 men and an overseer, here called
a Kenner, to each.  The crew is changed every 12 hours.
Our fishers are reckoned uncommonly skilful in this bu-
siness.  This arises from the difficulties attending the
fishing on Spey, from the rapidity of the river and o-
ther circumstances.  The fishers have about 1 L. 15 s. of
fixed wages, each man, for the season.  They have 6 d.
each, when they catch 6 fish or more within the 12
hours, and 3 d. when they catch only 4.: when they
catch beyond a certain number, they have a still farther
allowance.  In this way, they will make from 4 L. to 6 L.
in a season.  They have bread and beer, as much as is
necessary, while they are working, and a bottle of spi-
rits among the crew for the 12 hours they are em-

is mostly fir, with some little oak and birch.  It comes from
the extensive forests in Strathspey and Badenoch, belong-
ing to the Duke of Gordon, Sir James Grant of Grant,

*The hardships which these people undergo, without any inconvenience,
in wading in the water, often above the knee, during the winter and spring, and
remaining in wet clothes perhaps for 12 hours, will appear almost incredible to
those who have not witnessed it.  Yet such is the wonderful effect of habit.
