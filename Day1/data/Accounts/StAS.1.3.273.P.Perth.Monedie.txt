kept clean and neat.  There are four new farm-houses wholly
of mason work.

   Rents.-The valued rent of the parish is L. 2000 Scots;
and the real rent, by the improvements in agriculture, will
be as many pounds Sterling, if not more.  The tenants pay
their rents in money and victual.  Kain sowls, carriages,
shearing in harvest, running of errands, and other servitudes,
are now converted into money; which is a great benefit to
the tenants, who were obliged to answer their landlords,
when called upon, however unseasonable and prejudicial to
them.  The tenant now enjoys more liberty, and has more
leisure to attend to the improvement of his farm.

   Population.-Marriages, baptisms, and burials, taken at an
average of six years, immediately preceding 1791, are as fol-
lows:  Marriages 5d, baptisms 13, burials 10.  From an ac-
count taken by the elders, the number of the people is 520;
but there are between 7 and 800 joined, quoad sacra, to the
parish.  

   Poor.-The poor are provided for, by an assessment on the
heritors and house-holders; one half on the heritors, the
other on the house-holders.  For the purpose of assessment,
the heritors, minister, and elders, meet, on summons, half-
yearly in the kirk, inform themselves of the number and
state of the necessitous poor, appoint them a weekly allow-
ance, according to their different circumstances, and mark
their proceedings in writing.

   Church.-The stipend is four chalders of victual, convert-
ed at 10s. 5d. Sterling per boll, and four chalders, ipsis cor-
poribus, two thirds meal, and one third bear; which, with
