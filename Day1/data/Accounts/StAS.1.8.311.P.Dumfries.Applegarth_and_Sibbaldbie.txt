and was built about 30 years ago.  It is large anti well built,
and sufficient, at present, to contain the whole inhabitants of the
parish.  It has a large jam, very commodious for dispens-
ing the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which, in some of
the neighbouring parishes, for want of room in the churches,
is dispensed in the fields.  The stipend has been, for upwards
of 60 years, 72 L. Sterling, including Communion Elements;
but the Lords of Council and Session have lately been pleas-
ed to grant an augmentation of 4 chalders of victual, 2 of
them meal, and 2 of them bear, which will now make the
stipend 100 guineas a-year, or better.  The glebe is very
small, only consisting of between 5 and 6 acres.
   It is generally supposed, that there have been 2 parishes
annexed to Applegarth, viz. Sibbaldbie and Dinwoodie.  It
is not certain, however, whether Dinwoodie was ever a dis-
tinct parish or not.  It appears rather to have been a Chapel
of Ease to Applegarth.  Sibbaldbie has been a distinct parish;
and, some of the old people, now living, remember to have
seen the church standing, of which there are frill some vesti-
ges.  The minister of Applegarth was in use to officiate oc-
casionally, at Sibbaldbie, The Marquis of Annandale claims
the patronage of Sibbaldbie.  Sir William Jardine is patron
of Applegarth, and claims also the patronage of Sibbaldbie.

   Schools and Poor.-There are 2 school-houses lately built
in the parish, at the expence of the heritors, who have volun-
tary assessed themselves with the payment of 5 L. Sterling an-
nually, to one of the schoolmasters, and 3 L. 6 s. 8 d. to the
other.  There are about 10 or 12 persons in the parish on the
poor's list, who occasionally get a small supply from the col-
lections made in the church; and, there is a mortification of
3 L. 6 s. 8 d. granted by the family of Applegarth, which, by
the deed of mortification, is to be distributed at the fight, and
