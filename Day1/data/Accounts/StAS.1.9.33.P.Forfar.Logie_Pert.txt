     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER PETER.

     Name, Situation, Soil, Air, &c.

   IT seems probable, that the parish of Logie, or Logie-
Montrose, as it was formerly called, was annexed to
the parish of Pert perhaps about the year 1610 or 1615.
Logie, which is a very common name through Scotland, is
said to be of Gaelic extraction, and to signify a 'flat or
'low situation,' which particularly corresponds to that of
the Old Church of Logie, which is situated in a hollow or
low ground, by the side of the Northesk river.  Pert
is of uncertain origin.  The Old Church of Pert is like.
wise situated on the banks of the Northesk, very near the
Old North Water Bridge, and about 3 miles up the river
