   Inns, etc.-Here are 4 inns, and 12 ale, or rather whisky
houses.  Such houses are much too numerous in this coun-
try, and the morals of the people are greatly injured by
them.  They retail a base spirit, so lows, as to price, that
sixpennyworth of it is enough to make any man mad.

   Mills,-There are 5 corn mills in the parish, 4 of which
go by water, and one is driven by the wind.

   Cottagers.-The effects of employing cottagers upon
farms are very friendly to population.  Their children are
a stout and a healthy race.

   Tanning, etc.-Wanning of leather has been carried on
for several years to a considerable extent.  The tanner fees
our own cattle driven to England, and then sets off for
Ireland to buy raw hides.-Several cotton manufactures
have commenced.

   Stillatory.-Here also is a stillatory, which pays to the
revenue L. 729 per annum, besides malt-duty.

   State of the Country before the Union.-Before the Union
of the two kingdoms, this parish had nothing to trade with
but black cattle, and a small quantity of bear or big.  The
last of these last articles they sent to Man for brandy.
Agriculture was then so tittle regarded, that landholders
were often obliged to lend oxen, and horses, and seed-corn
to their farmers.

   Heritors.-The heritors of this parish are, the Right
Honourable the Earl of Galloway, etc. etc. etc.  John
Hathorn, Esq; of Castlewigg; James Murray, Esq; of
