  10. Mr Thomas Finlayson was ordained here on the 11th of
September 1717, and died on the 22d of May 1744. On the
5th of May 1715, a popular call, by the beritors, elders, and heads
of families, had been moderated in for Mr Chapman of Monedie;
but for some reason that cannot be now traced, be declined ac-
cepting of it.
  11. Mr James Lindsay, minister of Laucher, was settled here
in 1745, and translated to Lochmaben in 1750.

chosen minister here by the heritors, elders, and heads of fami-
lies, and inducted on the 21st of March 1751. He was transport-
ed to St Andrews on the 25th of October 1757, where he was
invested with the office of Principal. Mr George Lyon of Strath-
miglo received a call to succeed him in the pastoral office; but he
does not appear to have complied with it.

		   III.-POPULATION.
  The population of this parish has undergone great fluctuations.
In 1755, it was 764; in 1759, 600, in consequence of proprietors
letting out the lands in small possessions. It increased in 1774,
to 1026; in 1792, to 1260. The village of the Bridge of Earn
was erected in a great measure subsequent to the date last men-
tioned; but any accession it has brought to the population has
been more than compensated by the diminution arising from the
contemporaneous abolition of the slall farms.

                 The population, in 1801, was    1066
                                    1811,        1037
                                    1821,        1164
                                    1831,        1162
                                    1841,        1105
  If we may draw any inference from the number of baptisms in
former times as compared with the present, it would seem that
from 1658 to 1700 the population was larger than at any subse-
