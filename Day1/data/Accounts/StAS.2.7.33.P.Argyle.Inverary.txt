ing, the time necessary for removing or examining the train is so
great that it is considered more advisable to leave it till the morn-
ing.
The boats employed in fishing herrings in 1835 amounted to
55, and the general number averages from 50 to 60.  In that
year, the boats, men, boys, coopers, labourers, or gutters, and cur-
ers, were, according to the following table, from the different parts
of the parish, and it may form a fair average of the general num-
bers.  The employment of the labourers and curers is only occas-
sional.

It is impossible to state with any degree of accuracy the quan-
tity of herrings caught.  Many are eaten in a fresh state in this
and the neighbouring parishes; many are also sent fresh to the Glas-
gow and Greenock markets, and the remainder only are salted.
It is supposed * that one-third of the berrings caught are not cur-
ed.  The number cured for the last four years was, in 1832, 965
barrels; 1833, 1851 1/2 dn.; 1834, 2147; 1835, 1798; 1836,
1.206.  The average of these five years is therefore 1593 barrels
cured.  Two bushels of salt are allowed by law for curing each
barrel; but the quantity required varies with the condition of the
herrings.  The poorer herrings are cured with less salt.
The old and the most intelligent of the fisherman do not con-
sider that the improvement in the condition of the herring, which
take place after its entrace into Lochfyne, consists so much in
greater size or more fat, as in higher flavour.  The cause ascribed
for the entrance of the herring and its advance upwards to the
head of Lochfyne, is its desire of depositing its span in the mud-
dy grounds, which frequently form the bottom of the loch, and
that especially near the head.

supplied the statements in the above table, many of which are also consistent with
the writer's knowledge.
