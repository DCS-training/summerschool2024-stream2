along the Tilt, the Banavy, and the Fendar, the Bruar, and the
Garry; the various and well-conducted carriage drives: all afford
the advantages of active exercise, with the pleasure of admiring
magnificent scenery; and, if the whole be viewed in connection
with the forest and its lodges, its lakes and its rivers, Blair may be
justly said to be one of the most splendid hunting chateaux in
Europe.
   The House of Lude* has been built at different times, and the
greater part of it is old. Its elevated situation, and style of archi-
tecture, render it a very striking object in the scenery of the Garry.
   There is a good modern house at Auchleeks.

    There is good reason to suspect that the last Government cen-
sus is overrated. The present incumbent in his parochial visits,
and more especially in 1814, found the number of his parishioners
to be about 2333. The parish is divided into eleven districts, with
an elder in each district, and in May 1836, according to the cen-
sus of the elders, the population was found to amount to 2312.
   The gradual decrease of the population is easily accounted for.
In former times, the higher grounds were inhabited by numerous
tenants.  Their possessions were small; their supply of farinace-
ous food was precarious, and in the very best seasons afforded but
a scanty subsistence. They had no potatoes, and their principal
aliment was animal food. A system of more beneficial manage-
ment has converted these dreary and comfortless habitations into
sheep-walks; and greatly to their own interest, though not perhaps
at first so congenially to their feelings, the people have emigrated               -
to the large towns of the south, or to America. And though the
population upon the whole has diminished, it has greatly increased
in the strath of the country, which is certainly a more natural and
suitable residence for man, than the bleak unsheltered wastes of

by Burn, is to be built at Lude.
