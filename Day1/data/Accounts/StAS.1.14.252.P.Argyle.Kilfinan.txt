     Statistical Account

1793 souls.  The present incumbent could find no re-
cord in the parish to show its ancient state of population
at any period whatever; not even a catalogue either of
communicants or examinable persons*.  It is certain,
however, from the testimony of people now living, that
the parish has been more populous than it now is.  The
evident causes of its decrease, in point of population,
are, The introduction of pasturage, instead of farming,
and conjoining 2 or 3 farms together into one pos-
session.  By this union of farms, there are possessions in
the parish whereon resided formerly from 12 to 16 fa-
milies, now inhabited only by 1 or 2.  The smuggling
business being at an end, contributed also to depopulate
this parish; the most of those who dealt in it being
bankrupt, were obliged to leave the place in order to
push their fortune somewhere else.
   If the prices of cattle had continued as high as they
have been for some years past, there is reason to be-
lieve, that the whole of this parish would soon be con-
verted into such pastures as those above mentioned; but
the prices having this year fallen considerably, and with-
out any prospect of rising very suddenly, owing to the
present stagnation in trade, and the banks having given
up discounting bills, it is highly probable, that the ra-
pid progress of depopulaton will also receive a propor-
tionable check; and that the proprietors will find it

*The cause of this seems to be, that his immediate predecessor, who
was minister of the parish upwards of 4 years, was in such a bad state
of health, as not to be able to examine the people, nor administer the
sacrament all that time; and the last minister of the parish, prior to 
that period, also, was so superannuated, and fell into such bad health,
that he was obliged to leave his charge to an assistant, some years before
his death.  So that during 9 years prior to the admission of the present
incumbent, the sacrament was administered only once in the parish.
