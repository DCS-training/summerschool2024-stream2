having been by accident allowed to cool, the matter was found
to have taken the form of basaltic columns.
   We have but very little knowledge of the great processes
of nature, or the tremendous changes that have taken place
in this globe, owing to the remote antiquity of the events, and
the short period and imperfection of our records.
   Volcanos have been observed as far to the North and South
Poles as land has been discovered; and through all the inter-
veening latitudes. It would hence appear, that there is a
great body of active fire within the bowels of the earth; and
we know the effects of it often appear at immense distances,
and that it acts in a manner which cannot, or has not yet been
accounted for. Volcanos, we also know, have disappeared
in one place, and have burst out in another; and that every
part of the globe is subject to such convulsions of nature.
   The northern part of this island of Britain has not within
the record of history been subject to any remarkable physical
change, although it is evident that such changes have hap-
pened in it. The following recent facts, however, may not
perhaps be thought unworthy of remark; and a few facts are
of more value than a thousand hypotheses.
   In 1782, at the time of the dreadful earthquakes in Calabria,
the Mercury in the barometer in Scotland sunk within the tenth
of an inch of the bottom of the scale; the waters in many of
the lochs or lakes in the Highlands were much agitated.
   In 1783 - There was an immense volcanic eruption in the
island of Iceland *, which began on the tenth of June, and con-
tinued till the middle of August. A new island was thrown
up in the neighbouring sea, and again disappeared.
