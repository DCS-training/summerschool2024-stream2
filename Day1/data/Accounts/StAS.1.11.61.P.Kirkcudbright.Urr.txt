     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF URR.

     (County of Kircudbright-Synod and Presbytery of Dumfries.)

     By the Rev. Mr. JAMES MUIRHEAD of LOGAN, Minister

     of URR.

     Situation and Name.

   THE parish of Urr is situated in lat. 54 degree; and, from a
comparison of the tides, appears to lie about 30' of longitude
west from Leith.  The antient orthography was VR, and the
pronunciation was WUR, or WHUR, though it is now fre-
quently pronounced, and sometimes spelt Orr.  From this lit-
tle can be inferred, unless the above manner of pronouncing
the V or U should suggest, that the inhabitants of Galloway
were of German rather than Celtic extraction.  The consi-
derable lake, out of which the river Urr issues, is called Loch
Whur to this day.  There are also some people in this country
sirnamed Macwhur: But even this leaves the derivation of
the name of the parish uncertain.
