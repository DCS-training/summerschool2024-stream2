ter they are wrought and scoured.  In some places they are
purchased by dyers, and after being milled and dyed, are fold
again to those, whose province it is to fit and polish them for
the market.  In other places the persons both dye and dress
them.-  From the materials thus becoming the actual pro-
perty of those, through whose hands they pass, in the diffe-
rent stages of the work, it may be presumed, that the several
parts of it will be more expeditiously and better done, to insure
its selling quickly, and to good advantage.  As spinsters will
learn to examine the wool, weavers the yarn, and dyers the
web, before making a purchase, all of them are thereby sti-
mulated to take the greater care, to avoid all faults and ble-
mishes, which would hurt the sale, or lessen the profits of their
labour.  Besides, it seems probable, that the fewer employ-
ments any man follows, the greater will be his proficiency in
them.  They, who constantly and exclusively are kept scrib-
bling, who are accustomed equally to perform every branch
of the manufacturing line.  In like manner, the finest dye
will always be given by him, whole sole business it is, to mix
and prepare the colours, and fix them on the cloth.  And the
sweetest polish will come from the hand, which is only put
forth to the shears, the teasle, and the press.-  In oppositi-
on, however, to this reasoning, specious and conclusive as it
may appear, some intelligent manufacturers here prefer their
own method, of conducting the whole process from first to
last: asserting, that, from universal experience, the yarn and
webs, which they purchase, are greatly inferior to those
which are made under their own eye; and assigning, as the
reason of this inferiority, that, having the absolute direction
both of spinning and weaving, and a perfect knowledge of the
respective abilities of such as they employ, in these depart-
ments, they must easily perceive, and can keep out of their
