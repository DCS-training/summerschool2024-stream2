and the like on the other trifling burns in the parish.  The
roads in general are in tolerable repair.  The public road is
for the greatest part made by nature, and that part will re-
quire no repair perhaps for ages.  The statute-labour still
continues in this place, which, as it has been found defec-
tive of its end in other counties, is so in this.

   Curiosities.-There is a cave in the hill above Dunrobin,
from which tradition says, there is a subterraneous passage,
extending 4 Scotch miles, i.e. from the mouth of the cave
to the south side of the Little Ferry.  It is said that the late
Earl of Sutherland employed two men, furnished with lights,
and provisions of brandy, etc. to explore this dark prodigy
of nature, and that after they had travelled several yards, they
found the road partly so craggy, and partly so wet, and the
air so pestiferous, that they thought proper to return.
   There is a beautiful small cave at Strathsteven, in the east
end of this parish, in which 8 or 10 people could fit.  There
is a seat cut in the rock on each side, and at each end of the
cave, as if it had been done by art; but whether art had
any share in the formation of the seat, or whether it was
done by nature only, I cannot say.  There is room for a
small table in the middle.  It is situated in the face of a
bank within 140 yards of the sea; and there is a fine pros-
pect from it of the counties of Ross and Moray, and of parts
of other counties.
   There is a cascade on the burn of Golspy, within the poli-
cy of Dunrobin, and about a mile from the sea.  No ob-
ject of the kind, and of the same altitude, can exhibit more
wild beauty and grandeur.  It is about 50 yards high, nearly
perpendicular, the difference not exceeding I suppose 7 or 8
yards.
