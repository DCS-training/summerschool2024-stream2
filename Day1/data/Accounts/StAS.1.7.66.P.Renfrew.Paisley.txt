mounted to the value of 579, 185 L. 16 s. 6 d. and that no
fewer than 26,484 persons were employed in carrying them
on.  It is difficult to give an exact account of the state of its
manufactures at present.  The silk branch has evidently de-
clined, but the muffin has so far come in its room, and the
thread manufacture is considerably increased.  There is,
however, reason to conclude, that though it is daily advan-
cing, it has not yet recovered its former greatnets.
   Besides these principal manufactures, there are some others-
carried on there of too much importance to be overlooked.
For instance, considerable tan-works, four in number, two
soap and candle works, a manufacture of ribbons, and another
of inkle or tape.
   These valuable manufactures have had a most beneficial
influence over all the neighbouring country.  By the increase
of population and wealth which they have occasioned, the
farmer can dispose of every article of his produce to the
greatest advantage.  This stimulates his industry, agriculture
flourishes apace, and the value of land is amasingly increased.
The spirit of manufacture is the secret spring which puts all
in motion; and the weaver upon his loom, while he provides
a comfortable subsistence for himself and his family, may be
considered as ministering to the ease and to the elegance even
of the gentleman who lives upon his country estate.
