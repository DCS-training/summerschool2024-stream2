   Air, Diseases, &c.-The air of the parish is very
temperate, but rather moist, arising from its being ei-
ther surrounded by the Atlantic, or the high hills which
separate it from the parish of Torasay.  The inhabitants
are healthy, and attain the great age.  Even in Ross,
which is low and marshy, the inhabitants are healthy
and long-lived.  For though a great deal of rain falls,
yet the gales from the mountains purify the air, and
contribute to the health of the inhabitants.  Few diseases
are known except fevers, which are in general brought
from the low country, by labourers returning from the
harvest and other works they are employed in during
the summer and harvest.  The Island of I is an excep-
tion.  The inhabitants are not long-lived.  Few pass
70 years.  The asthma is very frequent among them.
This may arise not only from the damp vapours of the
Atlantic, but also from the great quantities of sea-ware
cast ashore, and allowed to rot, which occasions a very
offensive smell, particularly in summer.  The havock

mostly done away.  The inhabitants of I, Ross, and Brolass,
inoculate their children; but the people of Airdmeanach
have not as yet got over their prejudice, which occa-

times of grown persons.

   Lakes and Rivers.-Three inconsiderable lakes in Ross
are the only ones in the whole parish; the largest of them
is not above a mile and a half in length, and about a half a
mile in breadth.  In these there is no kind of fish ex-
cept trouts.  There are six rivers in Brolas and Aird-
meanach; but having no lakes for their source, and the
run short, they are not considerable, except in time of
