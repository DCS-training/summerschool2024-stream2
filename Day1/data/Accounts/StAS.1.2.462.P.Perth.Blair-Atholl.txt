seems to signify declivities, where a plough could
bring a surrow only one way. The antient Celtic names of 
places and things, were generally short descriptions of them,
though, in some cases, they also originated from remarkable
persons, and accidental circumstances.  It is the more neces-
sary to accertain these derivations now, as the country senach-
ies, or historians, who, in general, can best account for these
things, are daily growing worse, as labour becomes harder,
and more indispensable.  No time, therefore, should be lost,
in collecting what information yet remains, regarding these
particulars, before it is entirely gone, perhaps, never to be re-
covered.

   Situation, Extent, and Surface.-These united parishes
are situated in the Shire of Perth, in the presbytery of Dun-
keld, and the synod of Perth and Stirling.  Their extent is 
upwards of 30 miles in length; and, allowing for the as-
cents and descents of the hills, above 13 miles in breadth.-
through a large tract of country, the surface and appearan-
ces are various.  On the summits of the high mountains, the
weather has left little else than gravel and stones, covered
with moss.  This part is called Creachonn (creach-sbonn).
i. e. robbed land, the foil having been blown, or washed away,
a good way down the sides.  Farther down is heath, uva ur-
s, the craw-berry plant; on mossy or boggy places, "the cloud-
berry plant, and on drier ground, the whortle-berry-bush,
with coarse grass.  Lower down is heath, peat-bog, valleys

<FOOTNOTE>

Geal, signifying a sequesterd corner, cave, &c. Those, who retir-
ed to such a place, were called cuildeach, plural cuildich; which they
who spoke, or wrote Latin, turned into culdeus and culdei, altering
only the termination.
