and level on the top, which seems to be artificial, and has always
been called the Court-hill. In ancient times, it was probably the
place where courts were held for the administration of justice.
This rather interesting spot, in all likelihood connected with such
judicial proceedings, has of late been injured in its appearance,
by the erection upon it of some small cottages.
   It was already observed that the landward part of the parish
stretches up towards the summit of the Mulbuie, along the ridge
of which tradition supplies " tales of battles fought," to which
cairns and tumuli, and the marks of ancient encampments bear
ample testimony; and one cairn in particular is distinguished by
the designation of the Cats-Cairn-a natural English corruption
from Cairn-a-chath, signifying the cairn of the battle. Under
some of these have been found stone-coffins, and weapons of
copper and other metals, confirming the tradition that in this
place a gigantic Danish Chief was killed and buried. Indeed,
from its vicinity to the coast, and particularly the inviting landing-
place at Cromarty, it is easy to conceive this district to have been
a scere of incessant strife between these northern rovers, and the
tenacious Gaelic tribes of the country.
   Coins.-In 1787, several silver coins were found in a small cairn
of stones near Rosemarkie. They were mostly shillings of Queen
Elizabeth, with a mixture of other coins, and particularly some of
the times of James L and Charles I. It is probable they were de-
posited there in the time of the civil war, and may have been
brought into the country by the gallant Marquis of Montrose, or
some of his followers. About 200 more silver coins were found
in a copper jug of an antique form, in digging up the foundation
of an old house at Chanonry. They were coined in the reign of
Robert King of Scots. Small copper coins are frequently found
in labouring the grounds about the place, and more especially in
the garden&
