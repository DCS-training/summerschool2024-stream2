   The wool used in the stocking-manufacture is brought
from London and Newcastle.  The whole quantity of wool
imported annually into Aberdeen is not less than 2800
bags, of 240 lb. each.
   If the value of the stockings exported is allowed to be
L. 102,000, and the average price at the rate of 25 s. per
dozen of mens stockings, the quantity of wool consumed in
that article will be 2500 bags: the soap consumed in wash-
ing the wool and scouring the stockings will be about 37
tons, and about 35 tons of oil used in combing the wool:
So that there is expended in Aberdeenshire, and part of
the Mearns adjacent, on the manufacture of stockings for
foreign consumpt, yearly,

   It has been observed, that 300 dozens of mens stockings,
when packed, weigh 15 cwt. and measure about 50 cubic
feet; five feet go to a barrel bulk.  The quantity manu-
factured would therefore afford lastage for no more than
five vessels of a hundred tons burden, and the wool and
other materials used in the manufacture, cargoes for 13
vessels of the same tonnage.
   Allowing the linen-yarn manufacture to be of the same
amount, it is presumed the lastage is much the same with
