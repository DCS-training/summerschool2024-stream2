rally improve here, and are found to answer every purpose of
the farmer.  Their value, at an average, may be about 14 L.
Sterling, each.  There are about 280 milch cows, with their
calves, or followers as they are called, usually kept in the
parish; worth, at an average, about 6 L. Sterling each.  The
number of sheep in the district does not exceed 1880; they
are the common Scots kind, white on the body, and black on
the face and legs; they are very hardy, but their wool is
strong and rather coarse.  No swine are bred in the district.
Most of the farmers buy a pig or two annually, which they
feed for the use of their own families.

   Fuel, etc.-The greater part of the parish is but indifferent-
ly provided with fuel, for though there is some moss about
the middle of the parish, it is at a considerable distance from
the extremities of it, and consequently to the inhabitants of
these parts, very expensive.  The greater part of the fuel
used here, is coal from Sanquhar, which is likewise very ex-
pensive, being carried about 14 miles.  Nor is this all:  of
late years it has been of a very bad quality; and the demand
for it is so great, that the carters are often detained 24, and
sometimes 48 hours, before they can be served.  And it can-
not but be supposed that there must be a great demand for
coal at Sanquhar, when it is considered that there is no other
coal-work in Nithsdale, Annandale, the shire and stewartry
of Galloway.  The lower parts of Annandale, and of Niths-
dale, and all along the sea-coast of Galloway, would be sup-
plied with coal from England, at a moderate and easy rate,
were it not for the high duty, amounting also to a prohibi-
tion, laid upon them.  Were this duty abolished, the de-
mand at Sanquhar would be greatly lessened, and consequent-
ly this part of the country much better supplied.
