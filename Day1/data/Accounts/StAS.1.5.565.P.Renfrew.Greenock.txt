     of Greenock

Rew, and the peninsular parish of Roseneath; on the south-
east part of which is a castle of the Dukes of Argyle, with
flourishing plantations.
   In ascending the Greenock hills, the prospect is still va-
ried and extended.  From Corlic, the highest ground in
the parish, may be seen in a clear day, besides that of Ren-
frew, part of the counties of Bute, Arran, and Argyle;
with the western part of the Scotch Alps, the Grampian
mountains of Perth, Stirling, Clydesdale, Lanark, and Ayr.
From this height, people, who are fond of the varying

Sometimes, though rarely, during an intense frost, a

grounds, all bepowdered with hoar frost, pass a dark and
otherwise disagreeable day, a serene sky may be enjoyed
on the Greenock hills, without the least speck of cloud; as
the fog seldom rises more than 400 or 500 feet above the
level of the sea.  The surface of the vast mass of vapour
on which you look down, is so exactly defined, and seems
so compact and firm, that people might think they could,
from the brow of the hill, step upon it, and safely walk o-
ver to the hills on the opposite side of the river.  These
waves of vapour exhibit the swelling of the waves of the
sea without their motion; and, according to their situation,
form, and density, are variously tinged with the rays to the
fun; while a breath of wind now and then detaching the
