communication with the interior parts of the country, and
by reducing the price of coal, to be of advantage to the ma-
nufacturers of Glasgow.-The original subscription, however,
being found defficient, and the trade of this country brought
to a stagnation by the American war, the scheme was inter-
rupted until 1782, when the stock was sold by public auction.
Messrs.  Stirling, who purchased the largest share, and who
ultimately became the sole proprietors, began to finish the
plan; and, with great spirit and perseverance, have extended
the navigation to the river Calder, 13 miles east of Glasgow,
and formed a junction with the great canal at Port Dundas.
The canal is 15 feet wide at the bottom, and 30 at the sur-
face, capable of admitting vessels which draw 4 1/2 feet water,
equal to about 60 tons burden.-The height of the canals
above the level of the sea, is

   The whole Of there works are completed, except the locks
at Blackhill, which are in great forwardness.  A waggon
road is also finished between the bafon and Glasgow, which
renders carriage cheap and easy.  The total expence will be
30,000 L.  The Canal trade is at present as follows:
