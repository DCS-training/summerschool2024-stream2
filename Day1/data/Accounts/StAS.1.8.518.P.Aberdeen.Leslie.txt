   Antiquities, etc.-With regard to antiquities, this parish has
little to boast.  The remains of two Druidical temples still appear,
but neither of them are very entire.-At the head of the Den
of Chapletown, on the east fide of the road, leading from
Lesly to Alford, there is a place called the Four Lords' Seat, or
Little John's length.  It is a small circular, artificial hollow,
about 5 feet diameter, and 3 or 4 feet deep.  Tradition reports
that four different proprietors met at that place, and dined to-
gether, each of them sitting upon his own ground.  The four
proprietors are said to have been, the Lord of Lesly, Lord
Glammiss, the proprietor of Putachie, and the Bishop of Aber-
deen.  A little to the southwest of this place, there are some
vestiges of an encampment, in several places, the fossee is very
distinct, and in others almost quite filled up.  A little to the
West of this encampment, there are a good many cairns or
tumuli.  One in particular, larger than the rest, is called cock's
cairn.  None of them have been opened.  There is a tradition,
that a battle was fought here, but when, or by whom is quite
uncertain.

   Character.-The inhabitants are a sober, honest, decent,
well behaved set of people; some of them active and in-
dustrious:  They are humane and charitable, friendly and hos-
pitable.  Many of them are well informed in the principles
of religion, and are pious without orientation.  There are
no particular vices, to which they are generally addicted.
Capital crimes are unknown.  They enjoy the comforts of
life in as great a degree as their neighbours of the fame
rank, and seem to be pretty well satisfied with their con-
dition.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-This parish though the
soil in general be excellent, and the climate tolerable, yet la-
