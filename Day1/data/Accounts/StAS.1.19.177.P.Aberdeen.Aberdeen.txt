are brought from other parishes, especially from Aberdeen,
and buried here.  This is owing partly to their forefathers
having lived, died, and been buried in this parish; and
partly to the burial lairs being much cheaper here than in
Aberdeen.  From the manner in which the registers are
kept, it is impossible to determine how many of the per-
sons buried belong to the parish, and how many are stran-
gers, otherwise I should have marked this distinction
by inserting their respective numbers in separate co-
lumns.  By these observations it will appear, that no cal-
culations respecting the general population of the pa-
rish can be justly founded on the tables of burials, and
that the rule of multiplying the burials by 36 would lead
us greatly to over-rate the population of the place.  But as
by far the greater number of strangers buried here are
brought from Aberdeen, and as the same causes render the
number of females in both places superior to that of the
males, calculations from the deaths, intended to establish,
not the real number of people, but the proportion of the
sexes actually living in the parish, though not accurate,
will come nearer the truth.
   As the numbers who annually come from other places
to reside in Old Machar are greater than the numbers who
emigrate from it, and as the number of baptisms inserted
in the register falls short of the real number of births in the
parish, the rule of multiplying the number of births by 26
would lead us to under-rate the population of the place.
As in this instance, the errors arising from this mode of
calculation are easily accounted for by the daily influx of
strangers into a large city and its neighbourhood, perhaps
these rules for ascertaining the population of a country
may be found to hold with sufficient accuracy, if the births
