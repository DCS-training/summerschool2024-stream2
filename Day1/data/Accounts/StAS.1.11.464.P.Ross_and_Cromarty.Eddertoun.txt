     Statistical Account

   Rents and Proprietors.-The gross rent of the parish is
about 650 bolls of grain, and 500 L.  Sterling in money.  The
rent is fluctuating, but is daily increasing.  The heritors are,
Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, Mr. M'Leod of Cadboll,
Mr. M'Kenzie of Ardross, Mr. John Robertson merchant in
Glasgow, and Mr. Ross of Kerse.  None of these gentlemen
reside in the parish.

   Church and School.-The Church is situated within a mile

vicarage and communion elements.  All the parishioners are
in communion with the church of Scotland.  The patron is

is increasing.

   Employments and Character.-We have no established ma-

per day.  The people subsist chiefly by agriculture, and like
their neighbours, are of a mixt character.  They are very in-

   Antiquities, etc.-There is a large plain, about half a mile

where there are evident marks of an encampment.  Tradi-
