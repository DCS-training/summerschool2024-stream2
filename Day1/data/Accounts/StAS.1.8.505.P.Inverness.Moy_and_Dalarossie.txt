meal made into bread.  In the year 1422, it contained a gar-
rison of 400 men.  In those troublesome times, when it was
necessary to live either in fortified or inaccessible places, the
Lairds of Mackintosh resided here constantly, except in the
winter seasons.  At the distance of some hundred yards from
this, there is an artificial island formed, by heaping a parcel
of large round stones upon each other.  This place was used
for the consinement of malefactors, before the abolition of the
jurisdiction power, which was vested in the hands of the
chiefs.  When the lake was low, the criminal could scarce
stand with dry feet; but after rains, the water rote to his
middle.  Luckily, however, for the prisoner, in 24 hours he
was either acquitted or condemned.  This place is called
Ellan-na-glach, i. e. the Stoney Island.

   Mineral Well.-At the north end of the lake, there is a
well of mineral water, which is accounted serviceable for
headachs, and disorders of the stomach.  There is no account
of its being analysed, so as to have its qualities ascertained;
but it appears to be of the chalybeate kind.

   Popoulation.-The parish register having been destroyed a
few years ago, by an accidental fire, a lift of baptisms and
marriages cannot now be made out; nor can the population
be ascertained in that way.  The following is the result of a
late enumeration, taken for the purpose of this statement:
The deaths are not recorded in this, or the neighbouring
parishes, and therefore cannot be ascertained.
