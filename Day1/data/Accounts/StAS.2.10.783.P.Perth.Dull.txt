    at ` very low ebb throughout the parish; farms were not unfre-
    quently let on the monstrous principle of run-rig; leases were
    seldom or ever given ; the system of rotation  was all but un-
    known; and even, fields which were under the plough were not
    unfrequently broken and detached, either by banks, heaps of
    stones or marshy meadows. Now farms are divided and inclosed ;
    green crops and rotation in cropping are generally introduced ;
    cattle and sheep are improving both in size and symmetry; and
    the tenants are encouraged in draining, liming, and clearing their
    farms by getting leases, so that almost every district of the parish
    witnesses a yearly improvement in husbandry. The total want of
    turnpike roads, together with the shocking and all but impassable
    state of repair in which the parish roads were kept, were then a
    bar to the social and mercantile improvement of the parish ; but
    now the opening up of turnpike, and the regular repairing and
    macadamizing of private, roads; the establishing of regular car-
    riers; the letting of horses, post-chaises, and other vehicles for
    hire at most of the principal inns, united with the frequent and
    regular conveyance of letters and newspapers by means of the
    post-office system, are sufficient indications of the wonderful tran-
    sition experienced by the inhabitants of this district in their social
    and trafficking intercommunication with their more southern neigh-
    bours. Formerly, the tenants were restricted to particular millers
    and smiths, to whom they were obliged to pay certain heavy ser-
    vitudes; but now they are happily relieved from these remains of
    feudal slavery, so that they may choose their smith and miller
    where they best can. Then, the old Scotch plough, which was
    universally used, was drawn by four Highland ponies yoked a-
    breast and led by a driver walking backward; the horses' harness
    were rudely made of tow; sledges and creels were generally  used
    instead of carts; thrashing-mills had no existence; and private
    gigs and carriages were exceedingly rare, if not unknown. Now,
    all the implements of husbandry are generally of the most im-
    proved and superior description ; thrashing mills are coming into
    use; and private carriages are comparatively numerous. At the
    period above referred to, the common people's finest attire was
    made of coarse home-spun apparel. The men's only head-dress,
    both at church and market, was a common blue bonnet; that of
    the matrons consisted of what was called the curch, made of linen,
    and tied under, the chin,  while the unmarried, females, again, ap-
    peared bare-headed, with their hair tied up with a piece of ribbon
