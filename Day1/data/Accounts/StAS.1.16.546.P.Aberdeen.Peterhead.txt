though strangers complain of it, I do not think their healthy,
or the health of the inhabitants injured by it.

   Diseases.-There are no diseases peculiar to this parish;
rheumatism, phthisis pulmonasis, serofula and toothache
appear to be most frequent.  In 1782, the influenza was
very prevalent, but not fatal, excepting in two old persons.
The putrid sore throat has within these few years made

   Pleurifies and peripneumonies are rare, though they
sometimes happen.

   Mineral Waters.-There are a number of chalybeate
springs in this parish, and a very strong one in the town.

and only one river called the Ugie; this river consists of
two separate small, rivers, which take their rise about 18
or 20 miles from the sea; they are called the waters of
Strichen and Deer,) from passing by in their course these
