	Poor and Parochial Funds.--The average number of persons re-
ceiving parochial aid is 15, at the rate of L. 3 a-year each. The
amount of collections for their relief, being those in church only,
is, on an average, L. 50. But the proprietors on whose ground
they reside furnish many comforts to the poor, which lessen their
claims on the poors fund of the parish. They do not generally
apply to the fund of the parish till necessity compels them; and,
even then, they attach a degree of degradation to their allowance.
	Alehouses--There are four alehouses hn the parish, at present,
which have no good effect on the morals of the people.
