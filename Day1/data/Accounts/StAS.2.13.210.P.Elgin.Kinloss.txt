        Navigation-There are twelve vessels belonging to the sea-port
   of Findhorn in the parish, measuring in all 1000 tons register.
   Foreign vessels also visit the place, bringing sometimes two cargoes
   yearly of iron, tar, and timber from the Baltic, and one of timber
   from British North America. The articles brought coastways
   are about 25,000 barrels of Sunderland and Newcastle coals,
   which sell from 1s. 9d. to 2s. per barrel; 7000 bolls lime from
   the same places, which sell from 2s. 9d. to 3s. per boll.; 400 tons
   coals from the Frith of Forth, which sell from 13s. to 17s. per
   ton; 150,000 slates from Balachulish, which sell from L.2, 15s. to
   L.3 per thousand; 300 tons iron from Wales and Staffordshire,
   which sells from L.8 to L. 14 per ton, according to size And quali-
   ty; 400 tons salt from Liverpool, which sells from L.1, 16s. to
   L.2 per ton; 5000 to 6000 bushels bone-dust for manure, which
   sells from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 8d. per bushel. There are regular
   trading smacks from London, Leith, and Liverpool, which bring
   general cargoes of merchandise for Forres, Elgin, and Nairn.
   There is also regular communication by steam-vessels with these
   different places. The produce of the country around, sent coast-
   ways yearly, may be about 2000 barrels of herrings, 10,000 quar-
   ters of grain of every description ; 200 boxes of eggs, each con-
   taining 160 dozen; 2000 loads of timber, chiefly from the forests
   of Darnaway and Altyre.

      Market-Town.-The nearest market-town is Forres, to which
   there is easy access by au excellent turnpike road to Findhorn,
   and which strikes off, at the bridge of Kinloss, by a branch east-
   ward to Burghead and Elgin. The ride in this direction is one
   of the most beautiful in the district. Betwixt Forres and Find-
   horn there is a daily post. The distance is five miles.
      Village.-The village of greatest importance is Findhorn,-
   signifying in Gaelic the mouth of the Erne, and hence by High-
   landers called Invererne. It is a burgh of barony, and contains a
   pulation of above 800. It is the sea-port of Forres. The har-
   bour, formed in a great measure by nature, is among the safest
   on the coast; and, there being two quays of hewn stone, one of
   them erected lately with a breast-work, by which it is joined to
   the old pier, at a cost above L.1300, excellent accommodation is
   afforded for shipping. The entrance from the Frith at the mouth of
   the river is indeed, a little intricate, by reason of a bar that shifts
   with heavy  floods and strong easterly winds; but the intricacy is very
