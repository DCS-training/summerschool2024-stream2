			KIRKPATRICK-FLEMING.              281

	For many years past, the houses here have regularly been built
of stone and lime, and covered with slate; and the clay-houses,
once numerous, have almost all been pulled down, except towards
the east and south ends of the parish; and more modern and com-
modious dwellings erected in their place.

			III.--POPULATION.
According to the census by Dr Webster in 1755, the population was 1147
		last Statistical Account,1792,                    1542
		census of                1821,                    1696
					 1831,                    1666
	From 1821 there has been a decrease of thirty. Since the cen-
sus was taken in 1821, a number of families in the north part of
the parish left their farms, which were afterwards let annually as
pasture; and emigrated to other parishes or to America. This,
in a great measure, may be assigned as the cause of the decrease.

	Habits and Character of the People.--The habits of the people
are in general cleanly, and their dress is of late years greatly im-
proved. Gray plaids are frequently worn instead of great-coats.
The ordinary food of the farm-servants at their meals is oatmeal
porridge for breakfast, butcher-meat, with potatoes and bread, for
dinner, and porridge for supper. The food of mechanics is nearly
the same. The cottagers commonly make use of tea or coffee for
breakfast and supper, but seldom have it in their power to purchase
butcher-meat for dinner. Though farmers and mechanics, manu-
facturers, and agricultural labourers have various difficulties with
which to struggle, yet they appear, upon the whole, to be tolerably
contented with their situation and circumstances in life. The in-
habitants of this parish are, with few exceptions possessed of a
good deal of penetration and a great fund of common sense, and
are well acquainted with the principles of that religion which they
profess. The farmers are a respectable class of men,--industrious
