of the ground, and two of the weapons, was sent at the time by Mr
Mackenzie to the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh. He retained
two of the weapons, and gave the remainder to the tenant who made
the discovery. Whether these weapons were used in war or in the
chase is for the antiquary to determine.
   It is worthy of remark, that the farm of Kingside, or more pro-
perly the King's Seat, where these remains were found, was a hunt-
ing station of King James the Sixth.

                         III.-POPULATION.

   The ancient state of the population was very similar to what it
is at present, viz. purely agricultural and pastoral. The manners
no doubt were more simple and primitive. Most of the farms
were occupied by two tenants, who cultivated the land in alternate
ridges; and it is said that disputes as to the one encroaching up-
on the property of the other were very rare. Were such a mode
of cultivation in existence now, it would lead to interminable feuds.
Till after the middle of the last century the universal practice was
for the farmer and his family to sit in the kitchen and mess at the
same board with their servants. The moral influence of this prac-
tice, and the kindly feelings which it engendered, are now no more.
The line of demarcation between master and servant is now more
distinctly drawn, and it is believed that not one instance of this
practice now exists in the parish. A small landed proprietor, who
was alive within these fifteen years, was among the last to give it
up. Until the period of his second marriage, when he was far
advanced in life, he rigidly adhered to the good old practice of his
forefathers; but at length he consented to take a cup of tea at
breakfast with his wife in the parlour, upon condition that he should
first have his pint bicker of porridge as usual with his servants in
the kitchen; and this practice he continued till within a few years
of his death.

<FOOTNOTE>During the last seven years 53 couples, have been proclaimed, but as it frequently
happens that only one of the parties is resident in the parish, proclamation of banns
is consequently made in two parishes. No accurate general conclusions, therefore,
can be drawn as to the number of marriages that take place in Scotland from an in-
spection of the parochial registers.
