marians, the most learned in those languages which have
the nearest affinity to the Gaelic, have exploded every conjuga-
tion, except one; or have acknowledged, at least, that more
than one are unnecessary, because the rest are only modifica-
tions of the same verb, and declined in the same manner (z).
There are no more than one declension, unless we call the
masculine words one, and the feminine another.  The cases
of nouns are marked, not by additional terminations, but by
different particles, which are peculiar to each case, and gene-
rally a change of the last vowel in some of the cases (k).  The
genitive is often known by the construction.  When one sub-
stantive governs another, the accent is put on the last syllable
of the preceding word, with some change in the vowels;
which, without any possessive particle, shows that the follow-
ing word is understood to be in the genitive case.  Two sub-
stantives, pronounced with the same tone, are of the nomina-
tive case; but the accelerated pronunciation always denotes
the possessive.  This construction is called by grammarians,
who treat of it, the status absolutes and the status constructus
of words (l).  The degrees of comparison are formed, not
by adding certain syllables to the end of the adjectives, but by
placing before them; for the comparative, an indeclinable
word, signifying a higher degree of their quality; and for the
superlative, either another indeclinable word, denoting their
highest degree, or very frequently a repetition of the posi-
tive (m).*.
