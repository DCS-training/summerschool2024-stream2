   Language.-The western dialect of the Scots language,
is perhaps no where spoken in greater purity than in this
and the adjoining parishes.  The most striking peculiarity
of that dialect, is a disposition to shorten the penult and
prolong the last syllable of words, when the structure of
them admits of that being done.  The vowel which is ex-
pressed in the penult syllable, is for the most part the ob-
scure imperfect sound which the English give to the cha-

acute accent, or rising inflection of the voice, and the last
syllable with the inverted, or falling and rising circumflex.
The intervals between the extremes of gravity and acute-
ness of tone, are often considerable.-A few names of pla-
ces in this parish, as Glenshinnoch, Barcloch, and some o-
thers, beginning with the syllable bar, seem to be of Celtic
origin; but the greatest part of them are English com-
pounds, descriptive of the situation of the place, or expres-
sing some circumstance relating to it, as  Craigton, Long-
haugh, Dryknows, Longbank, Woodcockhill, &c.

fortunately been carried over some very high grounds, and
in consequence of that is extremely incommodious for the
heavy carriages which are continually passing between
these towns, an act of Parliament has lately been obtained
for making a new road along the side of the Clyde, the
line which ought originally to have been pursued.  This
new road is now begun to be executed.  Although there
are excellent materials for making roads in most places of
this parish, the cross roads through it are still in an indiffe-
rent condition, owing to the difficulty of calling out the
