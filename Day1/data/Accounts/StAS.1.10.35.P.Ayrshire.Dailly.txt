and uncultivated moors.  The only river in the parish is the
Girvan, which in its ordinary state is of very moderate
breadth, and no where navigable.  It is fed by numberless
smaller streams from the hills, some of which descend
through deep and woody glens, admired for picturesque and
romantic beauty.  Of these glens by much the most remark-
able and extensive lies on the eastern extremity of the parish,
near Kilkerran, the seat of Sir Adam Fergusson.  It has
lately been made more accessible by a path of nearly a mile
in length, cut along the brink of the torrent; and will, in
time, receive a vast addition to its present beauty from the
trees which have been planted on its craggy and precipitous
banks.  Near the lower extremity of this wild and romantic
dell, once stood a chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, from
which it still retains the name of the Lady-glen.

   Minerals and Mineral Springs.-The useful minerals with
which this parish abounds are coal, lime, freestone, and
marl.  The fields of coal, in particular, are uncommonly
rich and extensive, and were it not for the expence of land
carriage to the coast, and the want of a good harbour at Gir-
van, might supply the demands of an extensive exportation.
Except towards the lower extremity of the parish, they lie
mostly on the declivity of the hills on the north side of the
valley.  Those on the lands of Mr Hamilton of Bargeny
and Mr Kennedy of Dunure alone, are at present wrought;
and furnish about 9000 tons annually, at the rate of 3 s. 4 d.
per ton, merely for home consumption.  It deserves to be
mentioned, that a single seam, belonging to Mr Kennedy,
measures 18 feet in thickness, and lies in so favourable a
position, that the coal is drawn out on sledges at a very
moderate expence.
