higher price got for beef, butter, poultry, &c. but it does
not tend to raise the price of grain, for grain is generally
as high, and sometimes higher, in other parts of the coun-

the farmer has by the higher price of these small articles,
are balanced with the disadvantages he feels from the scar-
city of servants, and their increased wages, both occasioned
by the frequent opportunities which the young men have
of going abroad, it will be found that the farmers advan-

by seamen, or given for provisions, circulates, and tends to
increase the wealth of the place; but it also probably pro-
duces these effects:  The style and taste for better living is
hereby increased, and this taste being once acquired, leads
many to go abroad to acquire wealth to gratify it, which
occasions a scarcity of hands for the purposes of agricul-

   It might be reckoned among the advantages, that there
is plenty of limestone in these parishes; but through the
scarcity of hands, and of fuel, it is of no service.-The
scarcity of fuel is a great disadvantage, and in a few years,
must hurt agriculture, and lessen the value of property.-
The badness of the roads in winter is an inconvenience to
all who must pass them, but especially to the farmer, either
