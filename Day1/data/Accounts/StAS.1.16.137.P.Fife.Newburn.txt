participate more of the comforts and conveniencies of life

vance against the government of Great Britain.  But the
period has now fortunately arrived when, in consequence
of the vigilance of a vigorous administration, and the good
sense of an enlightened people, Britain is saved, and Vil-
lany, it is presumed, will no longer dare to address Igno-
rance; the period has now fortunately arrived, when the
eye of loyalty is gladdened to fee, that they who had
flocked to the standard of sedition are scattered: Yes!
the auspicious period has arrived, when the Genius of our
favoured isle, in all her native majesty and magnanimity,
can proclaim: "My children abhor the sanguinary fac-
"tions of France.  They disavow their principles, and de-
"test their practice.  Principles so base they leave for mis-
"creants to teach, and madmen to believe.  The season of
"duration is past, and Britons love their native land.  Many
"wanderes have returned to the House of their Fathers."
