nister from the Revolution.  There is but one Seceder, and
no Roman Catholics.

   School.-The school-house is in good condition; but the
salary being only 100 merks, no teacher thinks is worth his
while to stay long in the parish.  Accordingly, of late, there
has been a very rapid succession of schoolmasters, to the
great detriment of the parish.  The smallness of the emo-
luments excludes from a choice of teachers.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster, the population, in
1755, amounted to 1123.  The number of souls, taken last
summer (1791), at a parochial visitation was, 934.  Of these
there are,

   There has been no register of marriages and burials kept
in the parish before 1783.  From the register of baptisms it
appears, that the number has decreased.  This indeed.
might be expected, as several farms that formerly ket 2 or
3 families, are now possessed by individuals.  Of this fre-
quent proofs are seen, in the vestiges of old houses, of which
only the foundations remain. In all countries, where the
people live chiefly by pasturing cattle, this will be the case.
As they improve by inclosures, etc. fewer hands are necessa-
ry to superintend the flocks and herds.
