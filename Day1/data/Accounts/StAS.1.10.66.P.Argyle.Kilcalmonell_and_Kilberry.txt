     Statistical Account

est part of the farm servants mentioned in it are those em-
ployed in herding.  Some of these are cottagers, who, with
their families, are employed in herding in the larger farms.
The rest are boys and girls, residing in the families of the
farmers.  The cottagers get, for wages, a houses a cow's
grass, potatoe land, and as much meal or money as will make
their wages equal to that of the male farm-servants residing
in the families of their masters, which, including visuals, is
from 12 L to 14 L. per annum.  The boys and girls get from
24 s. to 50 s. per annum, according to their age, and the
trouble of herding.
   The farmers, besides having their own families constantly
employed in the business of the farm, have hired servants
during the harvest quarter.  They are fed in the families of
the farmers; and the wages of the women, during that peri-
od, is from 25 s. to 30 s.; and of the men, about 40 s.
They come mostly from the Western Islands, and from the
northern districts of the country.  The greater part of the
young persons belonging to the parish, who are not of the
families of the farmers, or not employed by their parents in
farming, seek for service in the neighbouring parts of the low
country, at the cotton works, and other manufactures.  Many
of the young men are seamen employed in vessels belonging
to the parish, or to the ports of Rothsay, Campbeltoun, and
Greenock.  The prices of provisions are not materially dif-
ferent from those at Greenock, the communication between
the two places being regular and easy.  This circumstance,
too, determines the wages of carpenters, masons, etc.  The
clockmaker mentioned in the table is 92 years of age.  He
enjoys great health and activity for his years, and can travel
many miles in a days to repair the clocks and watches of the
parishioners.  To the scanty and precarious subsistence this
affords, he is obliged to add by begging.
