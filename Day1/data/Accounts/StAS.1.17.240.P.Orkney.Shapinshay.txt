occupied in burning kelp, which is the great manufacture of
this country.  The men almost of the whole islands, and
many of the women, also exert themselves in this species of
industry; and their joint efforts some seasons produce up-
wards of 3000 tons, which, at a moderate rate, brings near
20,000 l. to the inhabitants.  As it occupies the industry, and
constitutes the principal part of the riches of the place, every
attention should be given it by those that are friends to their
country.  The proprietors of lands, and their tenants and
cottars, the tradesmen in the towns of Kirkwall and Strom-
ness, as well as in the country places, and merchants or
shopkeepers every where, derive from it much benefit.  To
them only who have stated salaries it is detrimental, by in-
creasing the quantity, and thereby diminishing the value of
money, and without adding to the stock, raising the price of
provisions.  Its being extremely useful, however, will serve
as an apology for our considering its nature, the purposes to
which it is applied, the mode of manufacturing it, and the
means by which that mode may be improved.

   Kelp.-Kelp is composed of the ashes of various sea plants,
cut from the rocks, or collected on the beach, and burnt in
kilns or pits made on the shore for that purpose.  It consists
chiefly of the fixed vegetable alkali, in a considerably caustic
state, never altogether pure, but intermixed with other salts,
and particularly with Glauber's salts, and muriated and vitri-
olated magnefiae.  The fixed vegetable alkali is the only valu-
able part of the kelp, and to it the other 3 kinds of salt are found
to bear but a small proportion; they do not hurt it materially
in the manufactures in which it is used, and if they did hurt
it, a separation from them could, with no great difficulty,
be obtained.  If it is pure, or nearly so, it answers every
purpose of the purest pot-ashes, which is a lixivial salt, ob-
