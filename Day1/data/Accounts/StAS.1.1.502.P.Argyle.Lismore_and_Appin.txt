   A man of singular frame was born in Appin.  He was the
stoutest or thickest man in Britain, or even perhaps in Eu-
rope, at the time.  His name was Carmichael.  He was a
soldier in the 42 d regiment, and died above 30 years ago.
He was said to be not above six feet high; but was so singu-

the Tower of London as a curiosity.  He was noted for the
mildness of his disposition.  He could carry on his back, with
case, 1 cwt. more than the stongest porter in Dublin.
