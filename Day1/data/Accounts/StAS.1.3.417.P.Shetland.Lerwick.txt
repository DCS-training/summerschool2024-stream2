ed to that of the firsts of Oarney.  There is no light-house
in Shetland; nor is there any chart of the country extant
that can be depended on.  A light-house erected on Noss,
a small island east from Bressay, might be of essential service,
as many ships have been lost on the east coast of Shetland,
especially within these last 16 years, that such a light-house,
in all probability, might have saved.  Some of the most re-
markable of these are the following:  In 1775, a Liverpool
ship, 2 men only saved out of 24.  In 1776, the Geres of
London, Greenland ship, was lost with her whole crew.  In
1779, a Dutch Greenland ship lost, one of the crew saved.
In 1780, a Russian man of war of 36 guns, on her way from
Archangel to the Baltic, lost, and of her whole crew only 5
saved.  In 1786, the Concordia, a Danish East India ship,
with a valuable cargo, outward bound, lost, and only 15 of
her crew saved.  In 1789, a Dutch Greenland ship lost, of
her crew only 5 saved.

   Harbours.-The only harbour in this parish is that od Ler-
wick, or Bressay, Sound, a capacious bay,  in which vessels, well
found, may ride at all seasons in perfect safety; and what
renders this harbour particularly commodious, is, its having
two entries, one from the south, and another from the north.
On the outside of the north entry, lies a sunk rock, called
the Unicorn.  When the East of Bothwell sled to Shetland,
the Unicorn man of war was despatched in pursuit of him.
On the appearance of the Unicorn, his ship,  then lying in
Bressay Sound, was got immediately under way, and sailed out
at the north entry, followed hard by the other; and, having
a pilot on board, got to sea, by which means he made his
escape, and was landed at Norway; while the chesing ship
was wrecked on that rock, which has ever fine been called
the Unicorn.
