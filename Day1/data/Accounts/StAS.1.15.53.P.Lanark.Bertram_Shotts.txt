the range of mountains which, in opposite directions, bound
his prospect, seems sunk beneath him; though in fact, at a
certain point southward the country begins to rise, and the
Clyde, 5 miles S. E. of Lanark, is upon a level with the spot

the Cant hills, 6 complete shires, with a part of 8 more, are
seen.  Here the whole country, from Arthur's Seat to the
hills in Arran, and the western termination of the Grampian

land, Tinto and Loudon hills, on the one hand, to the Lo-
mond, the Ochil, and Campsie heights, on the other, succes-

with the hills already mentioned, enter the towns of Glas-
gow, Paisley, and Hamilton, with villages and gentlemens

few miles S. E. of Shotts excepted, has the appearance of
much richness and cultivation.
