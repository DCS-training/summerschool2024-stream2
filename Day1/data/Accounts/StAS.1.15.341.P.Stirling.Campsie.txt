ing turnip than Campsie; at the same time, I rather think
they do not stand the winter well in this district; I have said
20 acres for pease and beans, the wet climate rendering these
a very unprofitable crop with us, growing all to the straw,
without any pods:  The produce per acre, at an average, is
about six bolls;-small as this may appear, it is at least one
third more than it was thirty years ago: If a stranger was
to view our crop at Lammas, when growing, or even in the
shock, he would be apt to conclude the product to be a great
deal more; the truth is, our moist climate produces much
straw and little corn; I believe, it may safely be affirmed,
that at an average there is not above fifteen pecks of meal
out of the boll; the barley produces better, the soil being
adapted for that grain; and it is said to malt remarkably
well; but the fault lies more in the style of farming, than in
the ground itself; so late as the year 1763, the farms were
possessed in run rigg;-there was scarcely any inclosing; the
moment that the crop was separated from the ground, the
cattle of the neighbouring tenants grazed in common, till
next Whitsunday; the distinction betwixt out-field and in-
field, was kept up with the most scrupulous exactness; there
was no rye-grass and clover sown, for making hay; and the
bulk of the farmers ploughed their land with what is stiled
the broad plough, the four horses yoked abreast.  These pe-
culiarities are new worn out; at the same time, farming,
both as to science and practice, is yet but in its infancy in
this parish.*

*It is true, that the climate is not good, but the soil is excellent; and as
the crops might be adapted to the climate, there are great hopes entertained,
that we shall one day excel in farming:  The following defects in our mode
seem to be most flagrant:  1st, The land being full of springs gushing out,
wherever any change of the soil takes place in the farms;-of course, north-
