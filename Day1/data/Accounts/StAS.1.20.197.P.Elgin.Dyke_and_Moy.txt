   It would also be a great convenience, if a quay were to
be erected on the west side of the river mouth, below Benf-
nefs, where ships from Findern harbour might come over
and lie to, for unlading lime and coals for the use of this pa-
rish, and for receiving the grain and wood wherewith it a-
bounds.  This would save a long carriage round the Bay,
and prevent the detention of corn ships by the swells of the
river, which wind raises as well as rain, to be frequently im-
passable.  This might be done without any prejudice to the
dues of Findern harbour.

   Rivers and Streams.-Our only river is the Ern or Find-

   Islands, Rocks, and Caves.-There are no islands, rocks,
or caves; but there are remarkable hills of sand, for which,

ready sale for pear-carts, and other implements of husbandry
of the cheaper kinds, to supply the neighbouring markets.
Ash, elm, beech, plain-tree, and such oaks as can be had,
are taken off by water-carriage; and firs, for roofing, fark-
ing, and flooring of houses, are sawn out here, and carried
