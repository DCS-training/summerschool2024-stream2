Said to have been a gift from King James V. for a night's
lodging, when he was separated from his companions upon
a hunting party.  This small property has continued e-
ver since in the same family, from father to son, with-
out addition or diminution.-SAUTRA seems formerly to
have been a very considerable village, and a place of much
conviviality, if we may guess from the great number of pub-
lic houses, said to have been in it.  Now there is nothing to
mark the happy spot where the village stood, but two or
three wretched cottages, feeble remembrancers of its antient
greatness.

     "Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,
     "Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;
     "Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,
     "And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall."
