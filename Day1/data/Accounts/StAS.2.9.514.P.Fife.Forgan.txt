	a passage hourly from each side, there are kept a large sail-boat
	and a pinnace and yawl, with crews at each station ready for the
	accommodation of the public, when required. About two years
	ago, the trustees found it expedient to let the ferry for five years,
	and it is now maintained by the lessees, who have since placed upon
	it a single steam-boat of sixty horse power, which is a greater
	steam force than those formerly in use. The lessees, besides main-
	taining the ferry in terms of the regulations of the trustees, are
	bound to pay a rent of L 2200 a year, out of which, interest at
	3 per cent. is paid on the large debt of L. 40,000 incurred in the
	ferry improvements. The remainder of the rent goes towards the
	extinction of the debt.
	For the year ending 31st December 1834, being the year pre-
	vious to that on which the ferry was let, the following is an ab-
	stract of the number of passengers, cattle, horses, &c., which were
         conveyed across the ferry:-

     	            Making a total amount of L. 4844, 5s. 5d,
       	   It may be important to observe, in regard to the above state-
	went, as illustrating the beneficial results of affording good accom-
	modation to the public, that since the improvements of a steam-
	boat and low-water piers were introduced, the number of passen-
	gers has been increased by about 20,000, and the amount of re-
	venue has been very nearly doubled.
	   Harbours.-The harbours of Woodhaven and Newport are
	the private properties of Mr Stewart of St Fort, and Mr Berry of
	Tayfield.  They can accommodate vessels of from 100 to 150
	tons burden, and are kept in good order. They answer the pur-
	poses of exporting the produce of the neigbbouring country, and
	of importing lime, coal, and other necessaries. The ferry harbour
	at Newport, which is the property of the ferry trustees, is a splen-
	did erection. It is 350 feet long, and 60 wide, with a carriage-
	way on each side, and with a depth of five feet water at low water
