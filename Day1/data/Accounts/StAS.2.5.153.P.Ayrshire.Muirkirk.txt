	Parish Register--Before the year 1772 the parish registers
are very imperfect and irregular; but since that period they have
been regularly kept. The first entry is dated in the year 1739.

			     III.--POPULATION.
	The population previously to the erection of the iron works, to
be mentioned afterwards, must have been small,--the parish being
a pastoral district, and the farms large. The present increase is
no doubt owing to the establishment of these works; but the po-
pulation is constantly fluctuating,--the iron company increasing
or diminishing, the number of workmen as the trade will allow.

			IV.--INDUSTRY.

	Agriculture.--As the whole land in the parish has not been
measured,--as it is for the greater part lying uninclosed, and
the sheep husbandry occupying the principal care and attention of
the farmers, little land in comparison is cultivated, and that, little
as it is, cannot be exactly stated in statute acres. But the pro-
bable quantity of land under tillage annually may amount to about
1000 acres, and the number of acres which never have been culti-
vated may be stated at about 25,000.* The number of acres
that might with a profitable application of capital be added to the
cultivated land of the parish, is very considerable; and, with a few

<FOOTNOTE>These numbers appear inconsistent with the real amount of acres in the parhsh,
which is 30,000. The 4000 acres not mentioned above have been in crop, although
not in tillage annually, and cannot, therefore, be added to the land that has never
been cultivated.
