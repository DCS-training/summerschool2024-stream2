with the exception of two or three Dissenters and one Roman
Catholic. There is, in general, a good attendance on Divine ser-
vice. The average number of communications falls little short of
100.
  Education.-The school is well taught. The teacher has
the legal accommodations, and the maximum salary, viz. L.34, 4s.
4d. per annum; school fees, L.18 annually on an average; emo-
lument of the session clerkship on an average, L.2; total, L.54,
4s. 4d. There is also a private school taught by a female,
in which instruction is afforded in reading English, needle-work,
and knitting.
  Poor and Parochial Funds.-The whole annual amount of con-
tributions for the relief of the poor, is about L.21; of which,
about L.8, 10s. is collected in the church; the remainder con-
sists of the savings of former times, together with the interest of
a sum of money bequeathed to the session, as before-mentioned,
by the late David Skene, Esq. In all, the sessional fund amounts
to L.330 Sterling.
	The average number of persons receiving parochial aid is from
six to seven; and the sums allotted v`rx from L.2, 2s. to L.4,
10s.; besides which, small sums are frequently given, when requi-
site. Independent of the above assistance afforded to ordinary pa-
rochial paupers, and of L.3 annually to a blind man who has a
legal claim on this parish, of late the session has to pay L.6 an-
nually as board for a foundling. There is also commonly raised
yearly, in the way of extraordinary contribution, from L.3 to L.4 in
aid of som charitable or religious institution.
