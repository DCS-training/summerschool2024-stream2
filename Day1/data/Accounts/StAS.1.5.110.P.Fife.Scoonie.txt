   Heritors.-There are seven large proprietors in the parish,
and two small ones:  Only two of the greaer heritors reside
in it, viz.  Mr Christie of Durie, and Mr Tullidelph of
Kilmux.  The proprietor of Durie possesses above three
fifths of the valued rent of the parish.  The house of Du-
rie is an elegant modern building, situated on a rising
ground, about a mile north from the Forth, and commanding
a most delightful prospect; with an extensive policy, laid
out in very good taste.  Few places in the country can boast
of a more eligible situation.  No estate in the parish is un-
der entail.

   Eminet Men.-Till within these few years, the estate of
Durie had been, for near two centuries, the property of the

ly eminent in the law department.  One of that family was Lord
Register, and another a Lord of Session.  On the latter an anec-
dote is reported, which strongly marks the barbarity of the
times, in dependence before the Court of Session, Lord Durie,
while taking an airing on the sands of Leith, was fosrcibly
carried off by one of them, in order to prevent him from
giving his vote at the decision of the cause, which the party
apprehended would be unfavorable to his interest.

   But of all the eminent men born in this parish, none has
been more remarkable for genius and learning, than Mr Je-
rome Stone.  His father, (a reputable seafaring man,) dying
abroad, when Jerome was but three years old, the mother,
with her young family, was left in very narrow circumstan-
ces.  Jerome, like the rest of the children, having got the or-
dinary school education, reading English, writing and arith-
metic, betook himself to the business of a travelling chapman.
