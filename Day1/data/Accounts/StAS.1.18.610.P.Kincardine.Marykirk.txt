   Village of Mary-kirk.-Near the banks of the North-Esk
river, and somewhat more than half way, on the road leading
from Montrose to Laurence-kirk, lies the village of Mary-kirk;
to and from which the traveller is delighted with the agree-
able appearance of the country.  To the north and northwest,
at the distance of sometimes 7 or 8, 9 or 10 miles, he be-

the inhabitants it contains is 208, and their dwelling houses are

except weavers and bakers.  Besides, there are 3 shop-keepers
who sell most things needful in the place; and for the accom-
