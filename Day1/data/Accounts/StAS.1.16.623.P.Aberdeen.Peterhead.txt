   There is only one gardener who manages his own gar-
den, the rest are employed, in dressing the gardens in Peter-
head, or as day-labourers, excepting one, who confines his
attention to a small farm.
   There never was a bookseller, bookbinder, or stationer
in this town, that deserves to be mentioned; there is one
going to settle very soon, and to carry on all these different
branches; I sincerely wish he may meet with encourage-
ment.
