No science can furnish, to any mind capable of re-
ceiving useful information, so much real entertain-
ment; none can yield such important hints, for the
improvement of agriculture, for the exetention of com-
mercial industry, for regulating the conduct of indivi-
duals, or for extending the prosperity of the slate;
none can tend so much to promote the general hap-
piness of the species.
