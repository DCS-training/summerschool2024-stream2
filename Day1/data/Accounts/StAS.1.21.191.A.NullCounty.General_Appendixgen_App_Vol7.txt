furnish many tons of it.  In the rock are many caverns or
excavations, arched in a very wonderful manner.  One of
these runs a great way under the land.  The brig of ae hair
already mentioned, is within this farm; and the breast of the
rock on each side of the inlet which divides the isle from
the mainlands is stupendous.

   `Middletown and Tullos.-On my farms of Middletown
and Tullos I have cleared, drained, inclosed and cultivated
ground to pretty much the same extent as on Altens; and on
those fields I have raised very weighty crops.  This year in-
deed they were rather too weighty for safety, and some of
the oats, which were higher than the surrounding dykes, fell
down under the rain and suffered a good deal.
   `At my entry to Middletown there was on it a swamp to
the extent of nearly 20 acres, almost covered with water, and
so boggy that even a person on foot could scarce walk upon
it.  This was owing partly to a little stream of water, which
comes down the valley, being suffered to spread on it, for
want of a clear channel being kept, and partly from the
springs bursting from the foot of the mountain to the
south of it.  The first malady I remedied by cutting a clear,
straight channel of 8 or 10 feet wide for the stream; and the
other I remedied in a great measure by cutting such a ditch
along the foot of the mountains as I had done at Altens.  Af-
ter all finding some bogs remaining in places, which at some
former period had been cast up for peat and turf, and were
below the level of the surrounding ground, I contrived to
drain them in this manner: I cast pits in the lowest places
to the depth of 4, 5, or 6 feet, till I came to sand, filled up
these pits with small stones, and covered them with turf, the
grassy or heathy side downward, and then raised the ground
by driving sand and earth from the neighbouring hills and
