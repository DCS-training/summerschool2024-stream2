plenty of small and some large trout; and salmon make their

   Buildings.-The castles of Mugdock and Duntreath, espe-
cially the former, have been anciently places of considerable
strength.  There is no tradition concerning the time when
they were built; nor do they bear any inscription from which
that can be ascertained.  Their construction, however, deter-
mines them to have been built about the same time, and for
the like purpose, with many others of the kind in Scotland,
viz. to defend the chieftains who possessed them from the
sudden incursions of a hostile or enraged neighbour.  The
castle of Mugdock seems to have been a regular fortification.
Covered on the east and north by a lake, the waters of which
were drawn around it by a ditch, whereof the scite is still
apparent it must have been inaccessible to any force, which
could be brought against it in those days.  The square tower
which is still entire, has something peculiar in its construc-
tion.  After rising to the height of the outer wall, the west
and south sides of it spread so as to form an obtuse angle at
the corner, over the great arched gate-way.  This would ap-
pear to have been done with a view of more easily observing
from within the motions of an affailant.  By this construc-
tion also, missive weapons might be discharged from both
those sides of the tower, upon an enemy approaching the
gate.
   Opposite to this tower, at the distance of 300 yards, is
heard a very extraordinary echo.  It repeats any sentence of
6 syllables, in the exact tone, and with the very accent, in
which it is uttered; waiting deliberately till the sentence is
finished, before it begins; and it will reverberate even a
whisper.
