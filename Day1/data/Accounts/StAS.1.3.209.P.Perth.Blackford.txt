of oatmeal, with a glebe and pasture ground, consisting alto-
gether of 17 or 18 acres.  Charles Moray of Abercairney is
patron.  The heritors of this parish are seven in number;
the Duke of Athol Charles Moray of Abercairney, Colonel
Drummond of Mahany,  George Haldene of Gleneagles,
Alexander Campbell of Barcaldine, David Drummond of
Duchaly, and William Graham of Orchill.  None of these,
except Colonel Drummond.  Mr Haldane,  and Mr Drum-

   Poor.-It appears, by the registes and books of accounts,
from the Revolution to the present time, that, in the parish
of Blackford, the ordinary funds have answered the ends of
public charity.  At first, very few applied to be taken upon
the funds of the parish :  And, till the Secession began,
the parish being much united;  all, except a few Episcopals,
came to church, and contributed to the support of the poor.
Thus more money was annually collected, than was expend-
ed, in the course of the year.  Hence the stock rose, and
being laid out at interest, and that interest allowed to accu-
mulate, the poor, in the year 1769, were possessed of L. 280
of stock.  About the year 1778, a farmer in the parish be-
queathed L. 50 to the poor.  From the year 1780, to the 
present year, the average annual sum received has been L. 33;
and the annual distributions at an average amounted to L. 28.

   Antiquities.-It does not appear that there ever was any
monastery in this parish.  But there were several chapels,
some of which are still standing;  and, before the year 1745,
public worship was occasionally performed in two of them.
One is situated at the house of Gleneagles, which is the 
burial place of the family;  and another near the castle
of Tullibardine, which was built in the form of a cross, in
