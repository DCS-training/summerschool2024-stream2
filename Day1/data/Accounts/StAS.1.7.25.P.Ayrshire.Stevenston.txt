   There are no magistrates, nor any local police in Saltcoats;
only one inconsiderable annual fair; no market-place nor
weekly markets; no tonnage paid by the vessels.  A shore-
bailiff levies the small anchorage dues, and carries into ex-
caution such regulations as are necessary for the loading and
sailing of the vessels; which regulations the owners or mas-
ters come under a written obligation to submit to.  The Earl
of Eglinton is proprietor, and receives rent for all the houses
on the Ardrossan side, built by the possessors on longer or
shorter tacks.  His Lordship is also superior of the Steven-
ston side of the town, all the houses, except a few, paying
him a small feu-duty.
