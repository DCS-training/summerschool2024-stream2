     PARISH OF AUCHTERDERRAN.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Soil and Surface.

     THE name of the parish, as well as many places in it, is
said to be derived from the Gaelic.  This parish is si-
tuated in the county of Fife, presbytery of Kirkcaldy, and sy
nod of Fife.  It is of an irregular form, about 4 miles long,
and 3 broad.  It is bounded by Auchtertool on the south,
Abotshal on the south-east, Dysart on the east and north,
Kinglassie and Portmeak on the north and Ballingry on the
west.  A great part, if not the whole of the fields are upon
coal.  Where the stratum connected with the coal comes near
the surface, the ground is barren; and, even where this is not
the case, it is not remarkably fertile.  It is most throughout.
Part of the soil is clay and part black earth.  The valley in
which this parish lies is bounded on the south and east by a
ridge of ground, and on the west by a similar ridge.  Though 
the height of the ground excludes the view of the Firth of 
Forth, yet the highest part of it, which can scarcely be called
a hill, is under village.  There are many little inequalities in
the fields, so that they appear rather broken and disjointed.
The same is the case with a great part of Fife.  There are
some rocks of a singular appearance.  What strikes the eye
