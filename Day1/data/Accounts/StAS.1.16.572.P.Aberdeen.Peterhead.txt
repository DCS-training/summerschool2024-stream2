session yielding a crop in that proportion.  The potatoe
most cultivated here is the kidney, planted at the di-
stance of 12 inches each way, sometimes 10 and 12 inches.
Sometimes they are liable to the curl, but not frequently.
   There is always an excellent crop of bear and grass im-
mediately after the potatoes; the grass frequently fails the
second and third year, but the ground may be afterwards
trenched for potatoes; and with a rotation of the same crops,
the same process continued for many years, without any
more dung or lime, where the land has been previously
brought into good order by proper tilth and manure; at
least I have seen this fairly tried in different fields, without
the ground being injured.  The common practice is, to
trench out of ley for potatoes, the next crop bear, and the
third crop grass; a judicious farmer, however, recommends
from his own experience, to take first a crop of oats out of
ley; next a crop of potatoes, and then sow bear and grass-
seeds, and by this means he thinks the grass will remain
longer.  In consequence of this advice, I have tried one
field in this manner; the grass had an excellent appear-
ance last autumn, after the bear was cut down, and bids
fair for a good crop next season, and confirming the obser-
vation I have received.
   Turnips, before potatoes were introduced, were sown,
and the next crop bear and grass-feeds; on the lands, with-
in two miles of the town of Peterhead, they are not found
in general to answer; there is sometimes a full crop of tur-
nips, but the bear crop generally fails; this is imputed to
poaching the ground in carrying off the turnips, which is
probably the case, as the clay being near the surface, the
water stands in pools all winter, and chills the ground; per-
haps by a careful hand pulling the turnips, and carrying
them off the field, this inconvenience might be obviated;
this however has not been tried.
