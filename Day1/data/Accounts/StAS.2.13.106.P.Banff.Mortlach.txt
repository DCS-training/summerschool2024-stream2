   of the Gordon family.  Besides these, there are various traditional
   and sure memorials of the famous battle of Mortlach, which our
   present limits will only allow us briefly to mention.
     1.  The vestages of an intrenchment on the Conval hill, called
   the Denish Camp.
     2.  A huge and irregularly  rounded stone, now part of the fence
   about a corn field, said to have been placed over the grave of Eu-
   etus.
     3.  Near the same place, is a small square peice of ground al-
   most covered with whims, into which multitudes of the dead were
   thrown.
     4.  Three lengths of Malcom's spear added to the lenght of the
   church, in fulfillment of his vow.
     5.  Three of the Danes' skulls built into the north wall of the
   church, the moulds of which are to this day quite distinct.
     6.  A large upright stone about seven high, on the one side
   of which are rudely carved-the cross and two figures of animals,
   and on the other side a snake.
       Modern Buildings.-A small neat Roman Catholic chapel, built
   a few years ago, and a jail now in progress on the square in the
   village, are the only modern buildings worthy of notice.

   				III.-POPULATION.
       It would appear, that, about fifty years previous of the date of
   the former Account, the parish had been considerably more popu-
   lous than it then was.  Since the census of 1821, it has increased,
   - which has been chiefly owing to the giving of land for feus, on
   part of Land Fife's property.  The village of Dufftown, which was
   begun in 1817, contains 756 souls, and the countrypart of the parish
   1877-making a total of 2633.  The yearly average of births for
   the last seven years is 64; of deaths, 34; and of marriages, 10. An
   allowance may be made for two of three births omitted to be re-
   gistered every year.
