young their success or disappointment in the matrimonial lot-
tery.  These being devoutly finished, the hallow fire was kin-
dled, and guarded by the male part of the family.  Societies
were formed, either by pique or humour, to scatter certain
fires, and the attack and defence were often conducted with
art and with fury.  Shrove Tuesday, Valentine eve, the
Rood day, etc. etc. were accompanied by pastimes and prac-
tices congenial to the youthful and ignorant mind.  The
market place was to the peasant, what the dr drawing-room is to
the peer, the theatre of shew and of consequence.  The
scene, however, which involved every amusement and every
joy of an idle and illiterate age, was the penny bridal.  When
a pair were contracted, they, for a stipulated consideration,
bespoke their wedding dinner at a certain tavern, and then
ranged the country in every direction to solicit guests.  One,
two, and even three hundred would have convened on these
occasions, to make merry at their own expence for two or
more days.  This scene of feasting, drinking, dancing, woo-
ing, fighting, etc. was always enjoyed with the highest relish,
and, until obliterated by a similar scene, furnished ample ma-
terials for rural mirth and rural scandal.
   But now, the penny bridal is reprobated as an index of
want of money, and of want of taste.  The market place is
generally occupied by people on business.  Athletic amuse-
ments are confined to school boys.  The hallow fire, when
kindled, is attended by children only; and the country girl,
renouncing the rites of magic, endearours to enchant her
swain by the charms of dress and of industry.  Dancing,
taught by itinerant masters, cards, and conversation, are the
amusements now in vogue; and the pleasures of the table,
enlivened by a moderate glass, are frequently enjoyed in a
suitable degree by people of every class.
