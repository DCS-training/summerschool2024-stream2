   Caves.-Vestiges of artificial caves appear upon the
banks of the river Jed, particularly two large caves dug
out of the rock at Hundalee and Linthaughlee.  Their di-
mentions cannot now be ascertained, being, from the steep-

The size of it was much smaller than the common wren; the
colour of the body nearly the same; but the head was adorn-
ed with feathers of a beautiful orange colour and gold.

   Number of Horses, Sheep, etc.-There are 414 horses in the
parish, and it is believed above 8000 sheep.  There are some
black cattle and horses bred for sale, but more for private use.
