of Urr.  From thence to Kelton and Rerrick, which are
conterminous to Buittle, on the west and south-west, its ave-
rage breadth may be 3 miles.

   Soil, Surface, Hills, etc.-The soil of Buittle is like most
of the land in lower Galloway (especially near the mouth of
the Urr), kindly and fertile, even beyond its appearance.
The surface of Buittle is unequal, and justifies Buchanan's
remark upon Galloway in general:-" Nusquam fere in
"montes attollitur, fed collibus tantum frequentibus intu-
"mescit."  The hills, however, being mostly green and
without heath, have lately drawn the attention of the indus-
trious; nor have their pains been ill repaid, as the soil is
often found deeper on the heights than on the lower ground.
It is here to be observed also, that there are few hills in this
part of Galloway, where cultivation is at all practicable, that
do not bear distinct marks of the plough.  The depths of
the furrows, too, plainly declare; that this tillage has not
been casual, or merely experimental, but frequent and suc-
cessive.  This should let both the antient population and in-
dustry of this part of Scotland in a more favourable light,
than that in which they are usually beheld.  It also affords
probability to a tradition repeated by the country people to
this day, "That at a time when Scotland was under a pa-
"pal interdict, or sentence of cursing from the Pope, it was
"found that his Holiness had forgot to curse the hills,
"though he had commanded the land, usually arable, to
"yield no increase; and that while this sentence remained,
"the people were necessitated to seek tillage ground, in
"places unusual and improbable*."  The gears through
