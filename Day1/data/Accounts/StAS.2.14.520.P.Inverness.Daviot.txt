                        IV.- INDUSTRY.

     Agriculture.- There are about 4000 acres, standard imperial
measure, which are cultivated or occasionally in tillage. There
are from 1400 to 1500 acres of waste land or in pasture, which
might, with a profitable application of capital, he added to the
cultivated land, if that land was to be afterwards kept in occasion-
al tillage or in permanent pasture. We have no undivided com-
mon in the parishes. There are about 830 acres of natural wood,
and of old and new plantations upwards of 2270 acres.
     The average rent of arable land per acre is L. 1 Sterling.
     The soil in these parishes varies much, being in some places
sandy and light, in others spongy and wet, with a clay bottom. In
some, it is of a black mossy nature; and in many, a composition of
all these. Barley and white oats have answered well; but black
oats and rye were formerly in use, and still continue to be so in a
few places.
     The progress of agriculture, as has been shown, was but very
indifferently attended to at the date of the last Statistical Account
of the parishes, and for several years thereafter. By the industry
and exertions of the following gentlemen, it has now, however, at-
tained a higher character in that respect than it formerly main-
tained. In the year 1808, Lachlan Mackintosh of Raigmore,
(who had previously purchased the estate of Culclachie), having
returned from India, very soon thereafter commenced a series of
improvements, by planting, enclosing, draining, and liming, and
has added upwards of 100 acres of arable land to the estate, which
was formerly but waste land and swampy ground. He carried on
a regular rotation of crops, with a fair return; and was the first who
attempted to raise wheat in the parish of Daviot, in which his
estate lies. The late Alexander Mackintosh of Mackintosh hav-
ing taken up his residence it Daviot, in the year 1821, follow-
ed the same example, in prosecuting extensive improvements in
that quarter, by adopting a regular system of farming. In 1823,
Colonel Mackintosh of Farr returned from India, and has since
that period been continually engaged in the improvement of his
property, by cultivating waste land, planting, enclosing, draining,
