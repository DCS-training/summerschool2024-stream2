     Statistical Account of the

   Professor of Oriental Languages.-On the suggestion of this
worthy prelate, a professor of oriental languages was esta-
blished in the University, for the advantage of the students
in divinity.  A salary of 300 merks was appropriated out of
the common funds; and Mr Patrick Gordon, professor of

"scarlet gown with hanging-sleeves; but those who are bur-

"four classes.  To those of the first class is taught the Greek
"language.  The students of the second class learn logic
"and metaphysics.  Those of the third class (who at the
"years' end are bachelors of arts) learn ethics and general
"physics.  The fourth and highest class completes their
"course with special physics and mathematics.  The time

"the day appointed, those, who are to receive the degree,
