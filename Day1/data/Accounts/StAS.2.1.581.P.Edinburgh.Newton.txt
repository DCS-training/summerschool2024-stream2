with swing poles, and enclosed by a wall, is rented by them from
the proprietor of the adjoining grounds.
   There are also Sabbath schools for both sexes, attended by
about 300 scholars.
   The teachers of the female schools have L.25 per annum, the
amount by which the fees come short of this being supplied by
the family of Edmonstone, together with a school and dwelling-
house. The emoluments of the unendowed school must be of
comparatively trifling amount, and very precarious, from the fees
being very ill paid. In the parish school, this is obviated by their
being paid weekly in advance; the only way in which, with such a
population, this could be secured.
   By the trust-disposition and settlement of Alexander Mitchell,
baker in the Canongate of Edinburgh, the rents of his property,
consisting of houses in different parts of the town, are to constitute
a fund or establishment, to be called Mitchell's Establishment,
and to be applied by the trustees therein appointed, 1st, towards
defraying the expense of managing the trust, and of repairing and
keeping in repair the subjects described; 2d, the trustees are to
pay yearly to the schoolmaster for the time of the parish of New-
ton, the sum of L.8, or, in the schoolmaster's option, the price,
according to the highest fiars of the county of Edinburgh, of
eight bolls of oatmeal, at two terms, &c., and that for the school
dues and education of four boys to be educated at said school;
and 3d, the surplus of the rents is to be applied in clothing and
alimenting four boys to be educated at said school; providing al-
ways that the parents of such boys shall be of respectable charac-
ter, and shall have been residenters and householders in the pa-
rish of Newton, for three years at least before being nominated;
that such boys shall labour under no natural incapacity of learning
or being taught; that, at the time of, nomination, such boys shall
be at least eight years old, and shall remain at said school and
enjoy the benefits of this trust until they shall respectively arrive
at the age of thirteen years; and, for one year thereafter, the pro-
portion of the rents under this trust which shall have been em-
ployed in clothing and alimenting each boy, shall be applied in
his outfit as apprentice-fee with him, or otherwise for his behoof
as may seem best to said trustees. The trustees are the ministers
of Newton and Liberton, or any one of them accepting the trust,
&c.
