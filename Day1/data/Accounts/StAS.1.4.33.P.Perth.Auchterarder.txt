     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF AUCHTERARDER.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.)

     By the Rev. Mr ANDREW DUNCAN.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

   THE ancient and modern name of the parish is the
same.  It is derived from the principal village or
town in it, and signifies the "summit of the rising ground;"
which describes exactly the situation of the village, which
is built on the  ridge of an eminence in the middle of Stra-
thern, and commands on the N. and E. an extensive pro-
spect of the adjacent country.  The parish has united with
it, that of Aberuthven, which lies upon the E.  Aberuthven
signifies the "mouth of the Ruthven," and it is in this parish
that the small river of Ruthven discharges itself into the
Earn.  The annexation of the two parishes seems to have
taken place some considerable time before the Revolu-
tion, and the distinction of the two, is now so much for-
gotten, that they never go by any other name than that of 
Auchterarder.  Auchterarder is situated in the county of
Perth, in the presbytery of Auchterarder, and in the Sy-
nod of Perth and Stirling:  It is of an irregular form; its
greatest extent from E. to W. is about 5 measured miles,
and from N. to S nearly the same; it  is bounded on the
W. by the parish of Blackford, on the N. by Trinity-Gaik,
