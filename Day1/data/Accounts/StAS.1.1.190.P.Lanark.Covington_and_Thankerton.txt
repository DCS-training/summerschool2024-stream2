     PARISH OF COVINGTON.

     By the Rev. Mr BRYCE LITTLE.

     Name, Situations, Extent, Soil, etc.

   THIS parish derives its name from Convent Town.  It
is in the country of Lanark, presbytery of Biggar, and
synod of Lothian and Tweeddale.  Its length from south to
north-is 3 miles, and its breadth 2.  It is bounded on the
east by Libberton; on the west by Carmichael; on the south
by Symington and Wiston; and on the north by Pittenain.
There is some barren heath; but the soil is in general fertile.
The haughs of Clyde are mostly of a good quality, but they
are subject to inundation; which, though pernicious at certain
seasons, at others enriches the ground, and supplies the place
of manure.  Part of the country is mountainous.  Tinto is
1720 feet above the level of the Clyde.

   Agriculture, etc.-Every farmer keeps two ploughs at least;
one of them is the old Scottish, and the other Small's.  There
are about 630 acres in tillage yearly:  About 90 in barley, 60
in pease, 70 in potatoes and turnip, 10 in lint, and the remain-
der in oats.  There are about 60 acres of sown grass.  Oats are
sown in March, and barley in the beginning of May.  The
best croft land is let at L. 1:1:0 per acre; the best pasture
