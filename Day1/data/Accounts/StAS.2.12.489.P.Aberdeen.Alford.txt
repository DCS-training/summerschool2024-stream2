tion is 500 feet above the sea.  Their temperature has been exa-

   The highest temperature of the seven years (82&deg;) occurred on the 9th June
1835.  The lowest temperature (12&deg; below zero of Fahrenheit) on the 15th Febru-
ary 1838.  The temperature has been below zero, Fahrenheit, only three times dur-
ing the last twenty-four years.
   The two times of the day chosen for registration, namely, 9 h. 15 M. A. M., and
8 h. 30 m. P.M., are those at each of which the mean temperature of the year
occurred at Leith, in 1824 and 1825, when an hourly register of the thermometer
was there kept.  The temperature at the two hours has not corresponded at Alford;
but the mean of the two may yet be nearly the true mean of the year.
