and all the west coast, are supplied in the summer with
meal, by vessels that come from different ports at a distance;

   Rivers and Antiquities.-There are many rivers in this pa-
rish, but no bridges nor passage but by horses; and there-
fore, when these rivers overflow their banks, which often
happens in the winter and spring seasons, and sometimes
even in summer, travellers are detained, and are exposed to

beautified with fir trees, and a variety of other kinds of
wood; in one of these islands there is an antient burying-
place, called Isleand-Mari, where the people on the north
side of the loch still continue to bury their dead.  There
is a well in it of a falubrious quality, the water of which
hath been found, for ages, past, very serviceable to many dis-
eased persons.  The remains of a Druidical temple is like-
wise to be seen in this small island.

which the country people serve themselves.  Gairloch hath
