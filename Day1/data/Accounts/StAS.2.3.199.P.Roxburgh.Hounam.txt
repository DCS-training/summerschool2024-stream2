pasture land." The decrease since that period, may be chiefly
ascribed to non-residence, emigration, razing of cottar houses, the
resorting of the poor and of operatives to towns, where they meet
with more employment, and to the too general system adopted by
landlords, of uniting a number of small farms into one, * and allow-
ing a single individual tenant, not only to rent several of these farms
in one parish, but to have a number of farms united in this manner
in different parishes. Such a system is, indeed, as has been else,
where expressed, "the bane of the comfort, happiness, and inde-
pendence of the lower classes."

   Character and Habits of the People.-If any of our people do fall
into bad habits it is chiefly from the cheapness of whisky. The
style of living and of dress has been much improved during the last
thirty years; and in no class more than among servants. Oatmeal
porridge, used with milk, or with beer made from treacle, is the ordi-
nary breakfast of the working classes, and of the younger branches of
