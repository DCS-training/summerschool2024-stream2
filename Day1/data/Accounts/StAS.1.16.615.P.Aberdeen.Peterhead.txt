   For two or three years past, from 130 to 140 tons of
butter are annually shipped at the port of Peterhead, which
is all made and cured within, the space of from 15 to 18
miles in the vicinity of the town of Peterhead.  This is now
mostly sent to the London market; formerly all the butter
from this corner was sent to the different ports in the frith
of Forth; part is still sent thither.  For some years past the
butter has sold from L. 56 to L. 60 Sterling per ton; on an
average L. 58, 135 tons would be L. 7830 Sterling.  From
160 to 180 tons cheese are annually shipped; they all go
to the different ports south from Aberdeen to Berwick, and
sell from L. 17 to L. 20 Sterling per ton.  On an average,
170 tons, at L. 18, 10 s. will be L. 3145 Sterling*.  Of

<FOOTNOTE>

*The quantity of butter and cheese exported is by some persons rec-
koned high.  I have reason, however to think it is accurate, as I have my
information from Mr John Sellar, a principal merchant in this town, who
is well acquainted with this branch of trade, and assures me, he himself
exports more than one half of what is stated in the estimate.
