cemented with lime, 8 feet long, 5 broad, and 4 in height; some remains of
a druidical temple; the vestiges of an old chapel: and in one of the dens of
the hill of Elrick, is to be seen the mouth of a cave, supposed by the vulgar to
penetrate for miles under ground, and celebrated in their legends as the resi-
dence of a noted robber and his gang.  He was slain by an ancestor of the
Johnstons of Caskieben; and the weapon employed upon that occasion still

in order to prevent its harbouring foxes and other ravenous beasts.
