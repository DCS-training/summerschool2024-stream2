spot of ground, where David I. built a magnificent
friary for some Cistertian monks, whom he removed
from Selkirk to Roxburgh; on the middle stood the town,
both under cover from the Castle, which was situated on a
large oblong knoll to the west, and separated from the city
by a narrow neck of land, formed by the proximity of the
rivers.  "The south walls of the Castle impended over the
"Teviot, a part of whose waters were directed by a dam
"thrown obliquely across the stream at the west end of the
"Castle into a deep fosse, which defended the fortress on
"the west and north, emptying itself into the river, at the
"east and thereof*."  Over this moat, at the gateway
from the town, was thrown a draw-bridge, the remains of
which were but lately removed.  About two miles west
from the Castle stands the present village of Roxburgh,
pleasantly situated near the banks of the Teviot, on a de-
clivity of southern exposure.  It is divided by a small ri-
vulet into the "Upper and Nether Towns," which had
formerly been of considerable extent, though they now con-

of the parochial church; is nearly centrical to the whole
parish; lies in the county which bears its name, and within
the bounds of the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse
and Teviotdale.

   Extent, Surface, and Soil.-The parish extends about
8 miles in length, and 4 in breadth at the extremities, in-
cluding an area of 7000 acres of land.  Its figure is irregular,
and may be represented by a spread eagle, with his head
towards the north, his wings shadowing eastward and west-
ward.  The general appearance of the country is flat and
sloping.  The soil is mostly a rich loam, well calculated
for bearing turnips or wheat:  The lands are therefore very
