nant is ruined in a few years, and the landlord's great rental
turns out to be nominal.  Proprietors here, however, are at-
tentive to the characters of tenants, as well as to the quality
of their lands, of which they are in general very good judges;
and accordingly let farms, at reasonable rents, to such as will

   The condition of the tenants in this, as well as in other
parishes on the north of the Carse, will be greatly meliorated
by making good roads to the different shipping places along the
banks of Tay.  This great improvement Mr Allan of Errol has be-
gun; and the several gentlemen in the neighbourhoodare heartily
disposed to carry on a works conducing so much to the benefit
and comfort of the whole country; faciliating at all time a
most useful communication which was before quite impracti-
cable, at least for loaded carts, during the greatest part of the
winter season.-Farmers might also meliorate their own con-
dition by attending, more than they generally do, to the breed-
ing of horses.-Every farmer of nearly 100 acres rears an-
