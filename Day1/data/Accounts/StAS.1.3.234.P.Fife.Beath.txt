     Statistical Account

   Heritors, etc.-There are 15 heritors in the parish, four
of whom are non-resident.  Many of them farm their own
lands, so that the real rent of the parish cannot be easily
ascertained; but there are about 30 farms in the parish, great
and small, which, taken at L. 150 each, at a medium, would
make the whole rent L. 1500.  About two thirds of the 
ground are inclosed, partly with stone dykes, and partly with
hedges and ditches.

   There is no lime here, but plenty of stone for building.
The whole of the surface is rugged and uneven, consisting
of a great variety of little hills, or rising grounds, but no-
thing that can be called a mountain.

   Population.-The parish contains about 100 families, which,
allowing somewhat more than four to a family, may amount
in all to from 400 to 500 fouls.  In Dr Webster's report, the
number is 1099.  The population has decreased considerably
within these 20 years; owing, not to any epidemical distem-
per, for the people are very healthy, but principally to the
practice of Living so much ground into grass, by which
means the farmers carry on their labour with fewer hands
than formerly.

   Poor.-There are no begging poor here, and only a few pen-
sioners, generally from 10 to 12.  These are supplied either quar-
terly, or occasionally, as they need.  The funds are the ordi-
nary collections, dues upon marriages, and burials, and the
interest of L. 100 due by bond to the session.

   Rivers, etc.-There are only two small rivers in the pa-
rish, one of which rises out of Loch Tilly, and drives two
corn mills, the only two in the parish; there is also a lint
