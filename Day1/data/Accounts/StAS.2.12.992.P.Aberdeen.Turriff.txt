   Old Church.-The date of its erection is not certainly known,
but it is supposed to have been built by Malcolm Canmore in the
eleventh century.  At all events, it evidently bad been used as a
place of worship before the Reformation.  It was so constructed,
that, however strong the lungs and powerful the voice of the speak-
er, the great body of the worshippers could not possibly hear dis-
tinctly, the length being 12o, and the breadth 18 feet.  In 1794,
a new church, of which notice will be afterwards taken, was erect-
ed, and there now only remain of the ancient fabric, around which
is the burying-ground of the parish, the eastern part of the build-
ing called "the quire," and the belfry, which is rather a handsome
piece of architecture, and contains a fine-toned bell, bearing the
date 1557, and which, after having been removed for thirty-four
years to the present church, was restored to its former position in
1828, when a clock was purchased by public subscription.
   In the churchyard are several ancient monuments, chiefly with
Latin inscriptions, worthy of record and preservation. *  The most
interesting are those to the memory of Barbara Mowat, who died
3d May 1558, and her husband, William Lindsay, 28th March

<FOOTNOTE>There is also a handsome monument, which had been placed within the church
on the north wall, in memory of one of the Barclays of Towie, and which, though
somewhat mutilated, bears the following inscription in capital letter:-
