the second son of the Lord Chamberlain, and ancestor of the
house of Philorth, now worthily represented by the Lord Salton.
On the 20th October 1413, William Fraser, Lord of Philorth,
sold to William de Hay, Lord of Errol, and Constable of Scot-
land, all the " landis of the baronyis of Cowy and Durryss, wid
tenand and tenandyris, and service of the tenand."*/f  This con-
veyance was confirmed by the Regent, Robert, Duke of Albany,
on May 14, 1415. (Robertson's Ind. p. 160. Wood's Douglas's
Peerage, Vol. i. p. 547). The Crown seems to have retained
right to part of the thanedom; for on the 13th April 1363, Da-
vid II. granted to Margaret de Saint Clair, Countess of Angus,
an annuity of L. 20 " ex thanagio de Colly."
    That part of the property thus conveyed to the family of Errol
was called the Barony of Urie, and continued many years in the
name of Bay. On failure of male issue, however, it returned
again to the family, from which it came, about the year 1640,
with the exception of those parts which were formerly disposed of
by the Hays, to Bannerman of Waterton, ancestor of the present
Sir Alexander Bannerman of Elsick, and to Burnett of Leys, an-
cestor to the present Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, viz. the lands
of Elsick and Muchalls. All the rest of the property was pur-
chased by William, Earl Marischal, and by him, about 1647, sold
to Colonel David Barclay, son to David Barclay of Mathers, and
representative of that family.+/f
	Parochial Registers.--The oldest record ofthe kirk-session is
a register of baptisms and proclamations of banns of marriage, be-
ginning 2d January 1620, and continuing, with occasional blanks,
to 5th February 1643. The following table, although it may
show the number of baptisms recorded, cannot be taken as giving
an accurate account of the births in the parish.

<FOOTNOTE> Crawfurd, in the Appendix to the Lives of Officers of State (No. 29), publishes
the disposition, as one of the first deeds of this description in the Scottish language.
	+ It would appear that the sale was not completed in 1651, when the Earl Ma-
rischal, being taken prisoner by the English, under Monk, and his estate forfeited,
they seized it, together with the lands of Ury, which Colonel D. Barclay had pur-
chased from him, on the pretext that the rights of the latter were not fully completed.
Upon this, by the advice of the Earl and his other friends, he became elected Mem-
ber of Parliament, as the only method left to get possession of his own estate of Ury,
as well as so do service to his country and friend
s. He was so successful, that he
got access to his own lands, and obtained large concessions in favour of the Earl
Marischal's family (Diary of Alexander Jaffray, p. 263. Lond, 1833).
