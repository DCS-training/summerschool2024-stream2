L.1441, Is. IId. Scots, or L.120, Is. 9d. Sterling,--making the
gross land-rent of both parishes, at that remote period, L. 260,
18s. 5d. Sterling.
   In the last Statistical Account of Sanday and North Ronald-
shay, 1793, prepared with great intelligence, care, and accuracy,
by the late Rev. William Clouston, then minister of Cross and Bur-
ness, the gross rent of the two islands is stated at L. 1064, 3S. O1/2d.
Sterling, and calculating at his conversion of rents in kind, which
would now be just about half-price, the then gross land rent of
the parishes of Cross and Burness alone amounted to only L. 413,
IIs. Id. Sterling.
