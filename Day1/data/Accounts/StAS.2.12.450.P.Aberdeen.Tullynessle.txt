above the circle, there were found two stone ladles, lying not far
from each other.  The handle of one of them had been broken
off; that of the other was about nine inches long, with a knob at
the end of it, evidently for the purpose of preventing it, when used,
from falling into the vessel, by laying hold of its edge.  A similar
stone ladle was, a considerable time ago, found when clearing out
another Druidical circle on the farm of Whiteside.

   The population, according to Dr Webster, in 1755, was, for
Forbes and Kearn, 436; for Tullynessle, 269.  The writer has
not the means of ascertaining how many of the first number be-
longed to Forbes, and how many to Kearn, and, consequently, is
unable to show distinctly the great increase of population which
has, since that period, taken place in the now united parish of Tul-
lynessle and Forbes.
   There is only one resident proprietor, viz. Colonel Leith of-There                                                                                 of
Whitehaugh.  The mansion-house of Little Wood Park, belong-
ing to the Honourable the Master of Forbes, the only other pro-
prietor's house situated within the parish, is at present rented by
the gentlemen who farms the neighbouring ground's.
   The whole population may strictly be said to be agricultural.
There are no doubt wrights, smiths, shoemakers, masons, and
is re required for its wants; and they generally rent a small posses-
sion.  Besides the resident proprietors, there are two or three gen-
tlemen in possession of farms, whose income does not wholly de-
pend on the produce of the ground.  It is to be hoped that their
agricultural occupations yield them profit as well as pleasure.
   Character of the People.-The character and habits of the
people, are both good.  Generally speaking, they are active and
persevering, temmperate, honest, and charitable.  In every commu-
nity, there will be exceptions to any tribute of commendation to
