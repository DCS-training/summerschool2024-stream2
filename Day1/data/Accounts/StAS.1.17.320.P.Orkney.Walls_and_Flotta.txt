     Statistical Account

This is totally inadequate to their support; but the charity
of the parish is not to be estimated by the trifle contributed
in money.  The people are far from being deficient in this
virtue; many of them possess it in a considerable degree,
and exercise it liberally in proportion to their abilities.  They
occasionally send supplies of the necessaries of life to the
abodes of the necessitous; and if, at any time, this supply
fails, the latter make an occasional tour, and the intention
of the visit is perfectly understood.  The charitable know
the necessitous, and the necessitous know equally well the
charitable.  If there be any who are unable to travel, their
case is always particularly attended to.  When the present
incumbent first understood how trifling the funds were, and
the destitute and helpless condition of some of the poor, he
was much concerned to think of the misery to which some
of them might sometimes be reduced; but was no less pleas-
ed to be informed, that there existed here a spontaneous
mode of charity, founded on the principles of nature and
duty, equal in its effects to any political institution what-
ever.

   Character.-The people are very peaceable and inoffensive,
apparently very simple but in fact abundantly shrewd.  Their
address is without embarrassment or rudeness, but not with-
out a degree of politeness and good manners, though some-
times an affectation of refinement in the last, makes it ridi-
culous.  What has been said of their charity, may serve as a
criterion of their sense of religious obligation.  Being stran-
gers to all the different opinions of sectaries, they are stran-
gers also to those vain disputations, violent dissentions, and
strifes about words, so frequently to be met with in other
places.
