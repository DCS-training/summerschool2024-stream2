crops of oats in succession, and at a distance from the dunghill,
the only manure almost then used, was lying waste, or cover-
ed very thinly with grass, its natural produce.  Here it was
dried and burnt; and the ashes being ploughed in, the ground
was cropped with oats, until it would produce no more.-
A third method of reclaiming the moss was to dig ditches, or
goats, as they are called, at such distances, and of such depths,
that the clay dug from them was sufficient to cover the inter-
mediate spaces of moss to the depth desired.-The clay, when
dug, was thrown at such distances from the ditch, that so
much moss was left on each side of it uncovered, as was
thought sufficient to fill it again to a level with the bottom of
the stratum of clay laid upon the surface.  The first of these
methods required only a little labour of the farmer and his
cattle, at a time, when by the mode of husbandry then practiced,
there was little other employment for them.-The returns it
produced were proportionably trifling, unless where the moss
was so shallow as to be nearly consumed by this operation.-
The second method required more labour, and produced more
valuable returns, viz. three and sometimes more crops of oats;
but, as the soil was touched in some degree by the moss be-
ing burnt once upon it, when the half burnt moss had been
ploughed into it, it became more susceptible of damage from
the fire every time the operation was repeated.  And, this
being the only one the farmer thought of, for making those
grounds productive, it was repeated as often as he could.
When long persisted in, this management reduced the surface
nearly to a caput mortuum, for which the only remedy yet
found, is by very deep ploughing, or by goating, which was
described as the third method of reclaiming moss, to bring up
a considerable quantity of fresh clay.-The goating of the moss
was the most expensive method, but it made the most substan-
tial improvement, especially if any considerable quantity of
