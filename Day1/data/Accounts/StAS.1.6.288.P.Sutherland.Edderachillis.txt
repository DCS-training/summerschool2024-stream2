floor of an ordinary room), by digging, turning out great stones,
and grubbing up bushes and underwood; that, excepting the
benefit of the straw, for saving the lives of their cattle in
spring, considering especially their soil in cultivation, they
would surely find their account in abstaining from agriculture
totally, and spending their time in some handicraft employ-
ment; but this must be understood concerning such as do not
work themselves personally, but must hire others to labour for
them, for that makes very great odds in this country.-It is
true there are ploughs drawn by horses, no less than 10 in dif-
ferent parts of the parish; but there is so little ground for them
to go upon, that 2 constantly employed, as in the low country,
could easily perform all the work of the ten*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The instrument chiefly used for tillage, is called a Cascroim, or crooked
foot; being a crooked piece of wood, the lower end somewhat thick, about
two feet and an half in length, pretty straight, and armed at the end with
iron, made thin and square to cut the earth.  The upper end of this instru-
ment is called the shaft, whereas the lower is termed the head: the shaft a-
bove the crook is pretty straight, being 6 foot long and tapering upwards to
the end, which is slender; just below the crook or angle, which is an obtuse
one, there must be a hole, wherein a strong peg must be fixed, for the work
man's right foot, in order to push the instrument into the earth; while in the
mean time standing upon his lest foot, and holding the shaft firm with both
hands, when he has in this manner driven the head far enough into the earth
with one bend of his body, he raises the clod by the iron headed part of his
instrument, making use of the heel, or hind part of the head as a sulcrum, in
so doing, turns it over always towards the left hand; and then proceeds to
push for another clod in the same form.  To see fix or eight men all at
work with this instrument, as is often to be seen, standing all upon one leg
and pushing with the other, would be a pretty curious sight to a stran-
ger.
   With all its disadvantages the Cascroim of all instruments is the fittest for
turning up the ground in the country; for among so many rocks, a plough
can do little or nothing, and, where no rocks are, the earth is commonly
so marshy, that cattle are not able to pass over it, without sinking deep.
