small, and cannot support a family without some other em-
ployment.  The number of heritors is about 28; the most
part of them are small feuars or portioners.  Lord Kinnoul is
the principal heritor: there is no free-stone quarries in the
parish; but there is plenty of whin stone, which is very use-
ful for building houses, and has been of great service in making
the turnpike roads in this parish and neighbourhood.  There
is only 1 meal-mill in the parish: of late, several mills have
been built for threshing corn.  There is a considerable brew-
ery and malting concern in Bridge-end.  Last season, there
was there malted 2008 bolls of barley, which paid of duty,
L. 761: 10: 9.  There is also a small tannage, which does a
good deal of business; and about half a year ago, Mr Young,
a watchmaker, has set up a new branch of trade; he makes all
the mechanical parts of a watch, and ends them to the Lon-
don market; he makes none which are sold under L. 25: 5,
when they are completed.
   This parish and district, derives great advantages from its
vicinity to Perth, and to the Tay, which is navigable to this
place.  The fuel of this country is coal, a regular supply of
which, till of late, was brought in plenty, from the Firth of
Forth, and sold at a moderate rate.  The ordinary price,
within these 6 years, was 3 s 2 d per boll, which weighs 40
stones; and the same quantity now, is 4 s, or 4 s 6 d.  The
late Act of Parliament, which took off the duty coast ways,
has in some measure, removed this hardship, as many now
burn English coal on reasonable terms.  Some of the poor in
this place use brush-wood, and some of them, make a kind of
peat of culm, or dross of coals, mixed with cow-dung.
