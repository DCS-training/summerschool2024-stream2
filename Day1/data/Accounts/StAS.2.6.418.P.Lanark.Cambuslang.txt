mily of any consequence is now possessed of a thermometer, baro-
meter, and hygrometer, which are hung up in a handsome maho-
gany frame as a piece of ornamental furniture. But few who are
possessed of these instruments make any use of them, or know
their value. We must therefore have recourse to other sources.
	From the most careful inquiry, it appears that the following
tables, drawn up by the late Dr Meek from observations made at
the manse of Cambuslang, from 1st January 1785 to 31st Decem-
ber 1791, are the most correct which can be procured, and accord
best with the present state of the climate. The three first co-
lumns contain the mean, the greatest, and least height of the ba-
rometer; the three next, the mean, the greatest, and least height
of the thermometer; the four following, the average number of
days in which the wind blew from the N. E., the S. E., the S. W.,
and the N. W. quarters; the two last, the average number of dry
and wet days. The barometer was marked every day at 8 o'clock
in the morning, and 10 o'clock at night; the thermometer, not
only at these times, but also at 2 o'clock afternoon; so that co-
lumns first and fourth express the mean height between these ex-
tremes of the day. The situation of the manse is about 200 feet
above the level of the sea, and about two miles north of Dechmont.
The last column is supplied from a rain-gage kept within a mile
of the eastern border of the parish.
