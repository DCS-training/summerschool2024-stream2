lation ; and, looking out for a suitable spot, he pitched upon that
one at Cross Arthurlie, which is still in the family. The site
proved at once his discernment, taste, and sound judgment. He
was soon followe4, by an host of imitators.
Cotton-sp inning.-Cotton-spinning began here in 1780 The
first mill was et down at Dovecothall, on the banks of the Levern,,
on the site of the old -corn-mill there. It is a small building, still
standing, containing three storeys, 8 feet each in length; is 34
long within, by 24 broad. This mill was the second cotton-mill
in Scotland, and was,built by Stewart, Dunlop, and Co.
The success of this mill induced the build in go for thets.- Gate-
side mill followed in 1786; Broadlie in 1790; Arthurlie in the
same year; Crofthead in 1792: and Mr Graham's in 180 1.
These mills were originally of considerable size; but since their
first erection, some of them have been built anew, and others have
had large additions made to them. By these additions, most of
,,them are twice as large as before. Take an instance; the old Le-
vern mill, the second in Scotland, was built, as said, in 1780, and,
according to Mr Wilson, was 78 feet long and 28 broad. To this
there was added another mill in 1800, of 123 feet IODG by 32i
broad, having five storeys in it, and to this there was, in 1834
added another addition, of 1 13 feet long by 40 broad,-the whole
forming Dow an immense pile of building.
But an idea of their extent, and the value of the produce put
out by them, will be best seen from the following statement, fur-
nished partly by James Orr, Esq. of Crofthead, William Craig,
Esq. of Kirkton, and others, spiiii3ers on the water.
