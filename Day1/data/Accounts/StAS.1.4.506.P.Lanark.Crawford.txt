16 miles.  All this extent of country, a few appendages
excepted, is possessed by 14 farmers of storemasters.  The
3 principal rivers in the south of Scotland, viz. the Clyde,
the Tweed and the Annan, have heir sources in the hills
which divide us from Tweed's-muir.  The hill calledd the
Lauders is chiefly within this parish, and is the highest in
the south of Scotland; its elevation above the sea being
3150 feet.  As to the climate, the follwing fact may be
stated:  In January 1785, a man perished here in the
snow; his body, which was not found till the month of
April following, was then scarcely begun to putrefy.  That
winter was indeed remarkable for snow and drist, and
the spring for frost.  At present, (middle of June 1791), 
the frost, attended with showers of hail, has been for some
nights so strong as to freeze water to the thickness of a
quarter of an inch at least.  The consequences have been
hurtful to potatoes, leaves of trees, kail, etc.  Our village
is 30 miles distant from Dumfries, 40 from Glasgow,
and rather more from Edinburgh.  There is a visible
descent on every side, except perhaps toward Crawford-
John and Moor-kirk.

   Agriculture, etc.-The greatest part of the parish con-
sists of hills or moors.  These are abundantly fit for pa-
sture.  Many of them are quite green.  Others, which are
partly covered with heath, have a great deal of the grass
called bent, which becomes very luxuriant in the months
of July and August.  In some high places, there is very
good moss, our of which peats are dug, which constitute
the principal fuel.  In many districts where peats cannot
be dug, the earth is blackish, and inclined to moss.  The
valleys consist generally of a spongy light soil, and some-
times of clay, and are all covered during the summer with
a very fine verdure.  The wet and swampy grounds pro-
