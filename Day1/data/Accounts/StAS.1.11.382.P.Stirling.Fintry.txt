happen in these parts, the Loup of Fintry may be mentioned
along with what is moss magnificent in this kind of object.
-There is also in this parish a grand range, or colonnade,
of basaltic pillars, which rise in a hill called Dun, or Down,
at the end of the hill of Fintry.  The range consists of 70
columns in front, which are of a gigantic stature, some of them
separating in loose blocks, others apparently without joints
from top to bottom.  They stand perpendicular to the hori-
zon, and rise to the height of 50 feet.  They are some of
them square, others pentagonal and hexagonal.  A block, se-
parated from one of the hexagonal columns, measured by an
accurate survey as follows:

On the E. side of the range, the columns stand separated one
from another, by an interstice of 3 or 4 inches.  This inter-
face lessens gradually towards the W. side, till nothing but a
seam is discernible, and then all is blended in one solid mass
of rock, which is very much boney-combed, and has the ap-
pearance of having been iguited.  The mountain above men-
tioned, consists of very extensive beds of red ochre.
