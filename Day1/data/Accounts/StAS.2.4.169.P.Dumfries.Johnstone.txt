lar soils; but these are not yet so far advanced as to enable us to
give the results.
	It is doubtful whether much improvement can now be made on
the general system of our husbandry, excepting, indeed, in so far
as it may gradually arise from the increasing skill and enterprise
of the tenantry.
	The prevailing surnames in the parish are, Johnstone, and Hal-
liday,-of the former there are 109, and of the latter 46.
	The prevailing disease among us (if, indeed, any can be so call-
ed,) is pleurisy, which sometimes shows itself, but generally in a
mild form, in the months of September and October. But of those
"putrid fevers" caught in olden times, partly by infection from our
voracious "neighbours of the mountaiins, * who fed upon carrion,
and who, from habit, are said to have preferred it to sound and
wholesome mutton," + we now happily know nothing.
	Finally, in this very populous, rural parish, we have neither pub-
lie-house-nor meeting-house-nor resident surgeon-nor village-
nor post-office-nor prison-nor lawyer-nor beggar,-specialties
we humbly conceive, not to be found united in any one parish of
similar dimensions in Briatain; and of which, though some may be
occasionally felt as parish privations, others are daily prized by us
as disthnguished blessings.

<FOOTNOTE>Query. Who could those neighbours be? or where, now are the mountains
here referred to ?
