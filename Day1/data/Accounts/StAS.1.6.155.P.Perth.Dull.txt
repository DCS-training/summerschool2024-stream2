laying out this money judicioualy, the work would be better
done, earlier in the season, and to a far greater extent*.
   The people are sober, regular, and industrious: they are
lively, chearful, and given to hospitality.  Crimes are daily
becoming more rare.  Gross offenders are held in great dis-
grace.  A notorious drunkard is despised in the highest degree.
The people enjoy, in a reasonable degree, the comforts and
convenience of life; and, in general, appear happy and con-
tented with their condition.  Their condition, however, might
be mentioned if proprietors would grant them leases of their
farms.  All of them are tenants that may be removed at the pro-
prietors will.  It has been said, that they would become indo-
lent if leases were granted to them; but experience shews that
this objection is ill-founded.

<FOOTNOTE>

*There are many Druidical temples in the parish.  A very great number
of old castles, many of them like watch towers.  There is in one glen no less
than the ruins of 15 of them.  It is called Fincastle, or Fonnebaistcal, the Land
of Castles.
   All the names of places are apparently Celtic.  Kynnachan, this place is
close by the old forest of Shichallin; here the gentlemen were in use to assem-
ble for the chase, and to uncouple their hounds; hence, the etymology appears
to be Coinneamb nan con; "the meeting of Dogs." Shierglass, "always run-
"ning clear," from the rapidity of the river Garrie, which shows close by it.
Duntaulich, " the castle of Tumble."
