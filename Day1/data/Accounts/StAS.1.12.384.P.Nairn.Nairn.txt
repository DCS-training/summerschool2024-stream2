and throughout the parish, are barley, oats, and pease; po-
tatoes in great quantities are likewise reared.  These last men- 
tioned, make up the food of the common people for nearly 
two-thirds of the year.  In the neighbourhood of the town, 
oats are a very unprofitable crop, seldom yielding the third 
seed in return.  In the parish there are about 50 farmers. 
The farms small; few of them exceeding 20 L., and only 2 a-
mounting to about 50 L. Sterling a-year.  In this parish are 
10 heritors and 1 wadsetter. 4 of the heritors only reside. 
The valued rent of the parish, as taken from the cess-books 
of the county, amounts to 1106 L. 8 s. Scotch money, exclu-
sive of the burgage lands, which may be nearly half as much. 
The present real rent, is about 1300 L. Sterling, besides about 
200 bolls of victual.  The rent of lands has risen greatly of 
late years, both in the town and country districts of the pa-
rish.  In the immediate vicinity of the town, the acre lets at 
35 s., a little farther distant, at from 18 s. to 30 s., and in 
the country from 5 s. to 20 s. the acre.  Of old, the greatest 
part of the rent was paid in victual;  but now it is mostly all 
converted into money.  Few customs or carriages are exact- 
ed.  And it is to be hoped, that every remain of feudal ser-
vitude will soon be entirely abolished. 

   Ecclesiastical State, Schools, Poor.-Nairn originally was a
mensal church attached to the Deanry of Auldearn.  The 
present kirk, manse, and offices, had a partial repair 1789, 
and are just now in a tolerable state.  The stipend is 5 chal- 
ders of victual, and 27 L. of money, exclusive of the sum al- 
lowed for communion elements, which is only 5 L; so that at 
the ordinary conversion, the stipend does not exceed 67 L. Ster-
