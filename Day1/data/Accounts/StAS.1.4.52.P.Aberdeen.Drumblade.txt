     PARISH  OF  DRUMBLADE.

     (County of Aberdeen.)

     By the Rev. Mr GEORGE ABEL.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   THE ancient name of this parish was Drumblait, the
modern is Drumblade, which signifies in Gaelic,
"hills covered with corn," of which there are several in
the parish.  Drumblade lies in the county and Synod of A-
berdeen and the Presbytery of Turriff.  Its form somewhat
resembles the body of a fiddle; the length from N. to S. is
from 5 to 6, the breadth from E. to W. from 4 to 5, and the
circumference about 18 miles.  It is bounded by the pa-
rishes of Forgue, Inch, Gartly and Huntly; by the two
last of which, it is intersected in some places.  The surface
is composed of small hills and vallies, some of the former
are covered with fir, but most are arable.  The vallies pro-
duce excellent crops where properly cultivated.  The soil
of tha last is a deep loam, and that of the higher ground is
thin, but fertile; the air tolerably falubrious, and the peo-
ple generally healthy.

   Animals.-The quadrupeds are horses, black cattle, sheep,
hogs, foxes, hares, polecats and badgers.  Birds are grouse,
partridges, plovers, a few wood cocks, etc.  The cattle
are not of an uncommon size, though they are very hardy
and serviceable.  Some cows bred here have sold at L. 8,
