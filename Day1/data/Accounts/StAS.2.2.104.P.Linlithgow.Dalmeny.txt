ingly, by the Earls of Rosebery, under protest from the Earl of
Hapetoun, who claimed the right alternis vicibus, in virtue of his
possession of the parsonage of Auldcathie, which had been unit-
ed to the parish of Dalmeny in 1618, Lord Binning being then
the patron of both. By a judgment of the Court of Session in
1835, the latter nobleman was found to,entitled to the alter-
nate presentation.
   Ministers of the Parish.-The earliest incumbent in this parish
of whom there is any authentic record, was John Gibbisone, minis-
ter of Dalmeny, and parson and vicar of Auldcathie from 1610,
where he is said to have succeeded George Lawder of Bass, who
united the advantages of patron and parson. Mr Gibbisone seems
to have died about 1648, and was succeeded by John Durie, who had
been appointed by the presbytery colleague and successor to, him in
she then united parish. At his death in 1656, Alexander Hamilton
was ordained and admitted minister of Dalmeny by a call from the
heritors and elders, the act of 1649 abolishing patronage being
then in force. He was deprived for nonconformity in 1662, re-
poned in 1669, and transported to Edinburgh at the Revolution,
where he died in 1669, and was buried in Cramond. Charles Gor-
don, minister of a Presbyterian congregation in Campvere, in Hol-
land, was appointed his successor in September 1691, in virtue
also of a call from the heritors and elders, in terms of the act 1690.
He was removed to Ashkirk in the same year, and died in, 1710.
From the date of his translation to 1700, the parish seems to have
remained vacant, the rents of the ministers glebe being gifted by
the Earl of Rosebery as patron, for the benefit of the poor, and
two silver communion cups, bearing the family arms, presented by
him for the use of the parish, and now its property, furth of a part
of the vacant stipends yet indisposed of." Between 1700 and
1711, John Steedman held the cure. The last appointment pre-
vious to the Act 1712, was that of James Nasmyth, who was in-
ducted hn 1711, and died at Dalmeny in 1774, in the ninety-first
year of his age. Dr Robertson, who was a person of some learn-
ing, and furnished the previous Statistical Account of the parish,
was settled in 1775, and died at Edinburgh, 15th November
1799. In the following year, James Greig, the late minister, was
appointed, and continued till his death in 1829, when the present
incumbent was translated from Torphichen.
