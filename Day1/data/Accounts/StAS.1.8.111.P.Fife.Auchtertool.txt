grounds, and richer and deeper as you descend.  The soil is
light, free and open; and such parts of it, as have a warm
southern exposure, are of a good quality:  But the ground to-
ward the N. W. end of the parish, is of a worse nature,
being a four, wet, clayey soil, and better fitted for pasture
than for cultivation.  A few acres, in the neighbourhood, are
covered with heath, and a few are sost and marshy.  These last
have occasionally been burnt, and for 2 or 3 years afterwards
produced good crops; but they are not of such a quality as
to render them sit for the purposes of general cultivation, or
productive for any length of time.  Several of the faces and
tops of the hills and rising grounds, are interspersed and cover-
ed with whins, which render them not only unfit for cultiva-
tion, but of a trisling value even for pasture.  If there were
inclosed and planted, they would both serve to give a warmth
and shelter to the neighbouring ground (things very much
wanted in this climate), and tend greatly to improve and
beautify the face of the country, by giving it a more romantic
and picturesque appearance.  Some gentlemen, in the neigh-
bourhood, are beginning to plant a little on their estates.  The
plan, however, is making but a slow progress.

   Minerals.-There are both free-stone and lime-stone in the
parish; but none of them are wrought.  The tenants, how-
ever, have liberty from the Earl of Moray, the proprietor,
to use as much of the lime-stone as they please, for manure
to their lands; a circumstance which is of material advantage
to them.  The ground is mostly inclosed, partly with stone
dikes, and partly with hedges.

   Climate and Lake.-The parish of Auchtertoul, is about 5
miles distant from the there to the east, and 4 to the south.
In consequence of this situation, the air is reckoned good and
