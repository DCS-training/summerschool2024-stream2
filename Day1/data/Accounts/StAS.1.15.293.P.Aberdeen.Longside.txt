tors* at Cairness, in the parish of Lonmay.  Another species
of a lighter colour, but also very beautiful, is found at Cairn-
gall; frequent specimens of which are to be seen in London
and other parts of England.  Of both species very large
pieces are frequently cut out, fit for pillars of 12 and 15, and
sometimes 20 feet high.  Their hardness, however, renders
them unfit for any, except the plainer orders of architecture.

   Diseases.-About 3 years ago, the putrid sore throat cut
off a good many (principally young persons); in some in-
stances 4 out of a family.  Gravelish complaints are also fre-
quent, which perhaps may, in some measure, be attributed
to the great quantities of beer used, and to the little pains
taken in preparing it.  Rheumatisms, too, are common.
Frequent fogs in the summer, arising from the low wet
grounds and mosses in the parish, and sudden changes of
weather, occasioned by our peninsular situation between the
German Ocean, on the one hand, and the Murray Frith, on
the other, seem to point out their causes.  But notwithstand-
ing these mementos of frailty, the climate, on the whole,
may be termed healthy, And though no very extraordina-
ry instances of longevity can be mentioned, few parishes can
produce a greater number of persons above the age of four-
score.

   History.-This article would he almost entirely confined to
the history of private families, and of the changes which land-
ed property has undergone in the parish (circumstances too
minute and uninteresting, to merit a place in a Statistical Ac-
count of a country) did not one part of it give some indica-
tions of its having been the scene of public and national contest.
