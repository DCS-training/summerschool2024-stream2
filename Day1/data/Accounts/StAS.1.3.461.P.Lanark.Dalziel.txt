made themselves intimately acquainted with their condition,
were ever ready to hear their tale, to take part in their trou-
ble, or to rejoice in their prosperity.  If any of his husband-
men were born down with the pressure of incidental mis-
fortunes, he raised them again by his bounty and forbearance,
never dismissing any of them who were willing to continue
in their possessions; but, at the end of every lease, preferring
them or their posterity to a new one, at a reasonable rent;
and this has been so uniformly the practice of his family,
that there are tenants who can reckon their ancestors in the
possession of the same farm, previous to the period at which
this family became proprietors.  He inclosed the fields with
hedges, and sheltered them with planting.  He abolished the
feudal custom of exacting carriages and other services from
his tenants; and, in short, did every thing to turn their at-
tention solely to the cultivation of their own farms.  Under
this mild and benevolent treatment, the peasantry, finding
their industry tended as much to their own and their poste-
rity's permanent advantage, as to that of an indulgent
landlord, profited by every lesson and example.  They began
to summer fallow their fields, to streight their crooked ridges,
to carry lime, and make composts; and the benevolent spirit
of their landlord spreading among them, every one is ready
to assist his neighbour on all emergencies.  And thus has the
value of the estate risen to nearly five times the yearly rent,
which it yielded when the same gentleman first succeeded to
it; and at the same time the condition of the tenants, with
their moderate farms, and plain manner of life, is perhaps as
happy as any to be met with.

   The Scottish plough, drawn by 3 or 4 horses, is generally
used in this heavy soil; lighter ploughs, drawn by 2 horses,
being only applied to the latter plowings of fallows.
