are let at 1 L. the acre, but the most of them at half of
that.  The soil lying farther off the water for about a mile,
is of a strong hard clay, and does not produce so good
crops as the lands above described.  The rent of these
lands may be about 7 s. 6 d. the acre.  The soil in the ex-
tremity of the parish is of a very black mossy bottom, and
produces bad crops; as the lands lie interspersed amongst
mosses, the crops seldom come to perfection.  The farm-
ers make most by raising young cattle and by milk, the
grass not being fit for fattening them.  The 2 first kinds
of soil described, may be, and some of it is improved, but
the last not capable of much.
   The farms here are generally small, few of them be-
ing equal to a ploughgate; the most of them only the
half, and some not so much.  The highest rent of a
ploughgate does not exceed 30 L. Sterling.  They uni-
verfally make use of the old Scotch plough, and gene-
rally have the one half of their ground tilled, and the
other lying in natural grass.  They let it lie commonly
for 3 years, and then plough it for other 3 years.  It is
generally milch cows they feed upon their ground, with
a few young ones to supply the place of the old ones;
but there are few or no sheep, the soil being rather wet
and mossy, and therefore not so favourable for them.
Their wives and daughters, together with a servant,
take care of the milk, of which they make a good
deal of butter and cheese, and by which the tenants ge-
nerally pay the most of their rent.

   Produce.-The soil produces pretty good flax, not very
fine in quality, but strong and good of its kind, though they
seldom raise more of it than is for their own use.  There
is also some bear raised, but the principal produce is oats.
Sometimes they sow grass seeds with their bear; but
