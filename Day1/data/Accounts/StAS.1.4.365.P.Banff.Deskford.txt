nips, 15 in potatoes, and 10 in lint.  Though the soil in 
many places seems favourable for the growth of flax,
it has not hitherto been extensively cultivated.  The cat-
tle are of the Scotch breed, but considerably improved in
size by the culture of green crops.  These are consumed
in rearing young cattle, which, from the situation of the
country, is found more profitable, than in fattening those
that are grown.  There are not many sheep, the pasture
being much confined by the improvements in the hills
formerly mentioned, and what remains being wet, is ra-
ther against their prosperity.  Some of the English breed,
and of a cross breed from them, are pastured upon the 
farms.  Those which pasture on the hills are of a very
small size.  The farms are small; the largest not exceed-
ing 100 acres arable, and the generality from 30 to 60
acres.  The rent varies from L. 1, 10s. to 2 s. the acre.
The average may be 9 s. the acre.  The leases are gene-
rally for 19 years, a term by far too short for spirited ex-

the houses are poor and uncomfortable; and no allowance
granted for meliorations.  There are 2 meal-mills and 1
lint-mill in the parish.  The real rent is computed to be
L. 1000 Sterling a-year, including money, victual and cu-
stoms.

   Bleachfield.-In the north end of the parish, there is a
bleachfield, rented by  manufacturer in Cullen, of about
10 acres in extent.  At this field there are whitened year-
ly about 1500 pieces of cloth, and 1700 spindles of thread
and yarn.  Owing to a deficiency of water, the machinery
is frequently wrought by horses.  

   Services.-It is reluctantly to be observed, that the te-
nants are bound to perform many services, such as casting,
