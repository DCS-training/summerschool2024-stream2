<FOOTNOTE>

In London, in the parish of St. Martins in the Fields, the poor's rates, at 1 s
the pound upon the house rents, amounts to L. 10,000 per ann. and many
parishes in London pay more than 1 s. the pound.  Many particular instances
might be mentioned.  At Alnwick it is said, the poor's rates amount to
L. 600 per ann. while the parish of Alnwick is not more populous than some
parishes in this neighbourhood, which have not L. 50 to support the poor.
Yet very many of the gentry of Scotland will contribute almost nothing, which
may render a compulsary law at last necessary.  Is it not a shame, that so ma-
ny gentlemen (besides never entering a church-door) never give a shilling from
one end of the year to the other towards the support of the pool?  When the
heart of an heritor is indeed softened, and his hand opened, he may give once
or twice in his life some carts of coals or bolls of meal to the poor; but it is
to them no more than a feast at the time, and is soon done; whereas half the
sum delivered to the kirk-session, and given out by them in shillings and six-
pences would be of much greater service to the poor, who, as I have said above,
can bear no wealth.  Upon the whole, the proper way to maintain the poor,
is to give them what is necessary to preserve them from starving, but not so
much as to damp their industry, or encourage idleness; and even that little,
they ought to receive, not as a right, but purely as charity; and I am per-
suaded, that all there purposes have been in general served by the manage-
ment of the kirk-sessions.
