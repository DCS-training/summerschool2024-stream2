of Buchan and Sir John Mowbray fled to England, where they
died soon after; and Sir David Brechin soon after embraced the
cause of his royal uncle.  The Bruce wasted the district of Buchan
with fire and sword, and such was the desolation he left behind
him, that the herschip of Buchan was mourned for more than fifty
years."-(Barb. Bruce.)  Boece says, " Qua victoriƒ ad Hene-
raurie (Inverury) partƒ:" it is accordingly by some historians cal-
led the battle of Inverury, by others the battle of Old Meldrum,
From Barbour's account, however, and from other circumstances,
there is no reasonable doubt, that the scene of the conflict was a
level field lying immediately under thd Hill of Barra, called at this
day, "the Bruce Field," which, though now levelled by the inexorable

<FOOTNOTE>English forbye, to win the Crown to the English Tirran Edward, In ae nicht, they
biggit a' that Camp o' the Hill heed, for the country was mensely agen them.  But
they thocht themsels that they had the ba' fairly at their fit noo, for Bruce was lyin
at death's door at Inraurie : and frae the time that he took ill, his folk, thinkin' a was
o'er wi' them, had turn't few in number.  But fan the nicht's mirkest, it's nearest the
crawin' o' the cock. Fan he heard o' their bein' at's very door as 'twar, up be sprang
fra his bed, like a fey man, and cryin' for's sword said ' Is'e mak' a speen or spuil a
horn.  These loons are physick to me.'  So out be gaed amang's folk, and fan they
were dwindled awa' till a hanfu' amaist, and sair be seem't dishertent, but only said,
' Fot we wint o' folk, we man men' wi' can :' so he order't them a' to be ready by
12 at nicht, wi' a' the nowt and horse they could gather.  A'well aff they set but nae
by the stracht road, but o'er the tap o' Lawel Side. which they cam 'till jist afor' the
sky ; and for as bare as it is noo, it wis than as I'm tauld a braw forest coveret wi'
bonny trees.  Bruce noo tied lichts to the horns o' the nowt, and reed cloth and white
napkins to the horse necks, and dreve them here and there through the wood, or-
derin's folk to mak a' the din they could.  The heart o' the Comyns lap to their mou,
for they thocht the haill o' Scotlan' was risen agen' them.  Jist at this time, wban a stir
began amo'them, Sir William Wallace, as wus agree't on wl' the Bruce, up's wi'astanc
like a House-side, and wi' the strenth o' 10 Galiahs, bungs''t frae" the tap o' Benachie;
and that they miebt ken fa the compliment cam' frae, he first prented the initials o'
his name ( W. W.) i' the side o't.  Fung it gaed thro' the air and lichtin' i' the mid-
dle o' the camp kill't not a few, and gart the yird stot to the very cloods.  The burly
wus noo compleet, and oot they ran oot o'er ither's hoods like as mony sheep oot o' a
fauld.  In this confession, the Bruce and his folk cam upo' them, and tho' they fogbt
hard, they war' sae mair defait that they could never haud up their heeds ahint it.
The King's spirits waur noo high, as 'ye may believe; but he wus doom't to get a
sair heart breaak afor 'nicht.  His bosom Comarade, the brave Englishman. Sir Tho-
mas de Longueville, wus mortally wounded i' the battle, but he continuet to feght
while it lasted.  He raid aff the field 'till he cam' to the Dykes o' Fala, but there
fell free his horse.  Callin' to the King, ' Noo, Robin.' he said till him, ' my een
will soon be clos't, and I've ae request to mak.  Ye maun jist lay my banes whar-
ever this arra fa's.'  So drawin's bow, he sent the arra wi' a' his micht through the
air, and it fell i' the Kirk yards' Bourtie here, twa mile awa.  The king's love o'
Sir Robert wus great, and he caus't mak' that image + o' him, whilk ye see lyin' yon-
der, and placet it on's grave. That ither image, as I've hard say, is  Sir Thomas
Ladye, wha fan the news o's death reach't England, gaed oo't o' ae dwawn intill ani-
ther, and wi'her last breath beggit to be laid aside him."
          This derives some vraisemblance from two rather rude image of a knight in ar-
mour and his dame, which occupied a niche in the old church of Hourtie.  They lie
now in the church-yard, neglected like the stranded remains of Polydorus.  It is hard-
ly necessary to remark, that no such knight as Sir Thomas de Longueville is known
historically to have been amongst the followers of either party.
