disbursements of the session were much about equal to the
whole income.  The dearth, at the commencement of that
period, was certainly the cause of the additional number; for
they are again reduced to six, who receive from 3 s. to 4 s. 6 d.
a month, with a small-sum annually for purchasing fuel.  As
no heritor, nor any person of superior rank, resides in the
parish, and the congregation is small, the weekly collections, 
which are only from one to two shillings, would not be near-

of this capital appears to have been legacies left long ago for
the behoof of the poor.

left 2000 merks Scots, half of the interest of which was for
the poor, and the other half was made payable to the school-
master for teaching six poor scholars.  Till lately, this was
all the schoolmaster enjoyed; but, by decreet of the com-
missioners of supply, the heritors are now burdened with the
payment of 200 merks Scots of yearly salary.  This, with
the salary, and usual emoluments belonging to the offices of
session-clerk and precentor, and fees for teaching  from 30 to
40 scholars, makes a living of about L. 25 Sterling.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The English, or that dialect of

the neighbourhood of Redcastle, now a ruin, in the parish
of Inverkeillor, and formerly a royal residence.  Hence
Courthill, where the courts of justice had been held; Hawk-
hill, where the King's faulconer had resided; and Cothill,
where the shepherd, it is likely, had his habitation and cots
