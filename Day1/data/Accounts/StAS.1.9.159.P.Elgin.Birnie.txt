thing would be more agreeable than to hear that others
are equally fortunate in making similar experiments.-Oats
and pease are sown from the 13th of March to the middle
of April; barley from the middle of April to the begin-
ing of June; turnip seed from the 25th of June to the
middle of July.-Harvest begins about the 12th of Septem-
ber, and ends about six week, afterward.
   The late Earl of Findlater and Seafield, a nobleman of
distinguished character, induced his tenants to make consi-
derable improvements in agriculture, by encouraging them
to fallow their fields, to low grass and turnip seeds, and
plant potatoes.  All which are obviously of great advan-
tage to the farmer.  He promoted also the manufacture of
flax and wool, by giving spinning wheels to the farmers
wives and daughters.  They now manufacture the whole of
the wool of their own sheep.  Of a stone of wool they make
from 36 to 40 ells of excellent plaiding, which they sell for
about 1 s. the ell.  When they have done with manufactu-
ring the wool, since the soil does not produce flax to per-
fection, they employ themselves in spinning flax imported
by the merchants in the neighbourhood, who allow them
3 d. for each hank of the coarsest, and 6 d. for each hank of
the finest yarn which they spin.

   Population, Etc.-According to Dr Webster's report, the
number of souls was then 525.-The numbers in 1781
were 460; in 1791, were 402.  To explain the decrease,
besides 24 persons who have emigrated to America, two
farms are possessed by tenants who do not reside in the pa-
rish, for the purpose of pasture, where 4 tenants formerly
lived.  Besides there are 4 tenants who possess as much
land as 8 did before.  There were 6 heritors in 1766, since
that period the Earl of Findlater has purchased all the lands
except a croft of about 5 acres.
