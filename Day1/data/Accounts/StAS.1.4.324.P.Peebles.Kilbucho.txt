     NUMBER XLIV.

     PARISH OF KILBUCHO,

     (COUNTY OF PEEBLES.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM PORTEOUS.

     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   KILBUCHO is said to be derived from the Gaelic, and to
signify the Cell of Bucho, but of whom nothing is
known.  The supposition of Bucho, being a corruption of
Bede, would correspond with a variety of traditionary re-
ports, concerning that saint; as it is said that a number of
monks, of his order, settled here, and gave name to the
church, etc.  There is likewise an excellent well of wa-
ter, called St Bede's.  There are some beautiful banks
said to have been raised by the monks.  The parish is a-
bout 4 1/2 miles from E. to W. and 3 from S. to N.  Al-
though, on the west, it is scarcely more than 1 mile from
Clyde, and about thrice that distance, on the east, from
Tweed, yet it belongs to Tweeddale.  It is bounded by
Culter on the W.; by Biggar and Skirling, on the N.;
Broughton, on the E.; and Glenholm, on the S. Kil-
bucho is somewhat remarkable for 2 parallel ridges of
hills, covered with heath and grass, stretching from W.
to E.; and for 2 vallies, on the N. of each chain of hills.
