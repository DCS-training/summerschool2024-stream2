plied with any in the neighbourhood.  But the heritors nei-
ther took any concern, nor expended a single shilling for their
relief.

   Heritors, Rents, and Roads.-There are 3 heritors in this
district, only 1 of whom resides.  The valued rent is 1166 L.
Scotch; the present rent, reckoning the victual paid to the
heritors at 12 s. Sterling per boll, is 652 L. Sterling.  The roads
in this district are made and repaired by the statute labour on-
ly; and, of consequence, they are in a most wretched state,
being scarcely passable in the winter season.

   Antiquities.-There are no antiquities in this district worth
mentioning, excepting some Druidical places of worship, and
a few trifling tumuli, which seem to have been burial places
in the times of heathenism.  None of them have yet been
opened.  Driminner, the ancient seat of the family of Forbes,
is the only castle and gentleman's seat in the district.  It seems
to have been built about the middle of the 16th century; the
oldest date is 1577.

   Character.-That the people in this district are satisfied
with their present situation, cannot with propriety be said;
their rents being triple and quadruple what they formerly
were, their lands still unimproved, their leases short, their stock
exhausted in the years 1782 and 1783, besides the high rates
of servants fees.  All these, as well as other circumstances that
could be mentioned, keep them still in pinching poverty, in
spite of their utmost industry.  They are, in stature, about
the middle size, and, in general, of a somewhat swarthy com-
plexion.  As to their manner of life, they are industrious,
sober, regular attendants on public worship and other ordinances
of the gospel; charitable, and of an obliging temper and dis-
position.  There are no sectaries among them.
