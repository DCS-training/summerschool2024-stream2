   Tacks in this parish are commonly let for nineteen years,
with a clause that the tenant shall bear the public burdens,
which, considering the land tax, the statute labour, and some-
times the minister`s stipend, at least the vicarage, and school-

ing but underdraining can clear the soil of such a nuisance; and yet unfortu-
nately it is but little practiced: 2 dly, Our inclosures are little better than rickle
dykes, built of stones, gathered from the land, without any mortar;-of
course, totally incapable of meliorating the soil by keeping it warm; which
would be the case, if the inclosures were made with of quick-set hedges,
and belts of planting, for which the parish is so remarkably calculated; these
dykes give the parish a cold and uncomfortable look.  3 dly, A great propor-
tion of cur arable land is laid down in the most miserable manner without
sown grass, and impoverished by three succeeding crops of oats; by this
management, it is in a most wretched condition, indeed, when broken up to
dergo anew the same rotation of crops of oats 4 thly, Our land, from being in
general a light soil, and situated in a moist climate, is much addicted to weeds;
it is foul even to rankness:-Of course, as the corns grow much to straw,
the stalk of corn is kept constantly wet at the root by the weeds; it soon rots,
and the least blast of wind in August, lodges the corn on the crost-lands be-
fore they are ripe; whereas, if summer fallowing was practised, there can-
not be the smallest doubt, but our crops would be clean and much earlier;
yet summer fallowing is scarcely ever practised in this parish: Along with
these defects, I must mention two other causes, which have not a little con-
tributed to retard our progress in agriculture:  In the first place, an over at-
tachment to grazing; which hath led the farmers to study more the raising
of sodder, than the raising of grain; by this means, the early-seed oats have
never received much countenance in this district; but, if we consider the
moistness of the climate, there is no parish which requires them more; and
from the experiments we have had of sowing early oats, upon land well
cleaned from weeds by summer fallowing, there is every encouragement to
proceed;-the grain was fully ripe and early housed.  2 dly, I am not sure
but the proprietors themselves have, in some measure, contributed to
the little progress which agriculture hath made in this district.  From an
opinion that land was always upon the increase, it has not been their
object to grant such long leases, as to encourage the farmer to sink money
in improving the land: The opinion that has gone abroad amongst land-
