               MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
  Since the date of the last Statistical Account of this parish, the
condition of the people has been highly improved in three essen-
tial elements of human happiness.   The great mass of the inhabi-
tants are better fed, clad, and educated, than their fathers were at
the period to which we have referred.  Farming is much better
understood and practised in every department; a much larger quan-
tity of produce is raised from the same surface; and the breeding
and management of stock have been carried to a high state of per-
fection.  Both the new farm-houses and cottages have in gene-
ral been improved, in accommodation and in comfort.  And the
new offices that have been built, are more ample and convenient.
But, with all these great improvements, still much remains to be
done.  Draining might be farther extended with great advantage,
and, were landlords to afford their tenants liberal assistance in lim-
ing various parts of the parish, thecrops would be much earlier,
safer, and more productive.
  And on the stock farms, in the higher parts of the parish, there
is a great want of plantation for shelter.  The writer of these re-
marks is not unaware, that there are farmers who demur to this spe-
cies of shelter as inducing sheep to too much repose,and inactivi-
ty in seeking food; but the objection has the misfortune of being
directly opposed to some of the best established physical condi-
tions, on which the health and productiveness of ruminating ani-
mals are known to depend.
