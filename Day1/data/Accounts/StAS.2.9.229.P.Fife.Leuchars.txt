is also a flourishing Sabbath school, which has subsisted for twen-
ty years. No additional school is needed.
   Literature.--A parish library was lately instituted by private
subscription in Leuchars, containing some hundred volumes of va-
rious useful and entertaining reading, calculated to promote men-
tal and moral improvement.
   Poor.--The multiplication of paupers is owing to the growing
impression, that heritors are bound to support the poor. Dilapida-
tions are annually making on the lying capital, and are in the course
of annihilating it. The number Dow receiving aid regularly from
the kirk-session is 30 persons; occasionally, 36. The average
number for a few years past is about 25. Average of aliment per
week for each is 1s. 3d. The annual amount of charitable contri-
butions is L.75; collections, L.23; land-rent, L.24; church seat
rents, L. 12; interest, mortclotb, hearse, L.11.
   Fairs.-Two fairs are held at Leuchars each year for the sale
of cattle and small wares. But of late years they have been little
frequented.
   Alehouses.--There are 6 alehouses in the village of Leuchars,
and other 6 along the great roads of the parish.
   Fuel.--Coal is brought from Newcastle and the Frith of Forth
by sea; also by land from the coal districts in the county. Wood
is much used as a burning material by the villagers, who enjoy the
valuable privilege of carrying home the debris from the plantation
on Colanel Lindsay's estate.
   Advantage is often taken of the savings banks in the neighbour-
ing towns.

                 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   Since last survey, the greatest change is the enlargement of our
villages, and the depopulation of the country parts of the parish,
which has not been attended with an improvement in the morals of
the people in general.
