     Statistical Account

besides, among them, 100 acres of muir, for which they pay
nothing; the greater part of which is capable of being im-
proved into good arable ground.-The disadvantages of this
parish are, first, its distance from Glasgow, which is its mar-
ket-town Another, is the expence of fuel; no good coal be-
ing nearer than 7 miles, and no peats within less than two miles
and a half.  But the greatest disadvantage is the want a good po-
lice.  There is no magistrate nearer than within 4 miles; and
the place is oppressed with gangs of gypsies, commonly called
tinkers, or randy-beggars, because there is nobody to take the
smallest account of them.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Balagich, Dunwar, Mires,
Blackwood, and Mellawher, are remarkable hills.  The first
two are nearly of the same height; and their summits are 1000
feet above the level of the sea.-The inhabitants are under
no servitude to the landlords; and in general pay nothing more
than their money-rent, cess and road-money; some few ex-
cepted, who are bound by their leases, to perform one or two
days work yearly to the landlord, which is seldom exacted.-
The farms, in the lower part of the parish, are all inclosed,
and great benefit is derived from it.
