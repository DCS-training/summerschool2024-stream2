   The average produce of each 4 bolls is highly rated at 9
Scotch, or 36 English gallons, and the average price equally
so at 13 s.  4 d.  per Scotch, or 3 s.  4 d.  per English say 6 L.
The refuse for cattle may be worth 5 s.  which is in fact the

our victual into cash for the payment of rent and servants; and
whisky may, in fact, be called our staple commodity.  The
distillers do not lay the proper value on their time and
trouble, and of course look on all, but the price of the barley
and fire added to the tax, as clear profit; add to these the
luxury of tasting the quality of the manufacture during the
process.
   A very beneficial alteration in the distillery law would be
a more frequent renewal of licences; suppose 6 months in-
stead of 12.  As it now exists, the distiller becomes bound
for 45 L.  for a 30 gallon still, from the 1st December to the
1st December, let the prices of barley and spirits be what
they may; of course, he is under the necessity of continuing
to distil, however exorbitant the first, or cheap the last.  This
has two bad consequences, when a crop is unproductive, it
raises the price of meal on the one hand, and renders
spirits a dangerous drug on the other.  The above alteration,
