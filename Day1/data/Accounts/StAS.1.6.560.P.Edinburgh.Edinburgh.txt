   The old town of Edinburgh at that time consisted of the a-
bove six parishes only, consequently the preceding lift contain-
ed every family then living in what was properly to  be called
the city of Edinburgh.  On the population that there were at
that time even 6 individuals in each family, the total number of
fouls would amount to 19,998, which gives but a poor idea
of the situation and importance of Edinburgh at that period.
If we reckon the Canongate to have contained 2500 inhabi-
tants, the parish of St. Cuthberts 7000, and those of South
and North Leith 6000 fouls, the total number of individuals
in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, was 35,500 in 1678.
   The Rev. Dr. Blair communicated a paper, containing an
enumeration of families and examinable persons in the city of
Edinburgh, apparently taken in 1722, in which the numbers
in each parish of that city were thus stated,
