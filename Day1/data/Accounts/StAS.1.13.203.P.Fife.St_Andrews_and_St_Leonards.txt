     of St Andrew's

the Court of Session, for an alteration and division of the
parish church, has caused a very minute inquiry into the
present population.  The numbers reported on oath by the
the tellers, are as follows, viz.
   Number of souls in the parish,         
   In the town and royalty,                 2390
   In the suburbs of Argyle,                 129
   In the country,                          1431 

                                    
                                            3950
   Children incapable of going to church,
   In St Andrew's                           288
   In Argyle                                 14
   In the country                           202

   
                                            504
   Supposed necessarily detained at home,   
   In St Andrew's                           189
   In Argyle,                                16
   In the country                           231

   
                                            436

   In the country,                           22
                                            ---
                                            118*

<FOOTNOTE>

*When the three last castles are deduced from the total, there remain
2892, who are or ought to be attending public worship in the Established
Church, and for that number the pursuing heritors insisted, that there
should be accomodation in the parish-church.  The desenders alleged,
that accomodation is needed for no more than 1860, being about two-
thirds of the examinable persons.  The number of parochial communi-
cants at the Lord's Supper, is between 1500 and 1600, and the church, as
now seated, cannot contain above that number.  The issue of this process
will determine what proportion the Lords of Session judge that the size of
a parish-church should bear to the number of inhabitants.  By one interio-
cutor they have already ordered an architect to visit this parish-church,
and report whether be can find accommodation in it for 2500.
