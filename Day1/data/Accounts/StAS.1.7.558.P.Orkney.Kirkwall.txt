which is the post road; and a third to Stromness, about 12
miles west of us, which is the principal resort of the shipping.
These three, together with some few more of less note, are the
only roads that have yet been formed.  They are now fallen,
in a great measure, into decay; and this has been owing to
a defect in their original formation.  Instead of drawing a
ditch at some distance from the road, to carry off the water,
which they ought to have done, they have dug one close by
the side of its in which the water, running with rapidity, has,
in some places, undermined and carried away the road itself.
From time to time, these roads have been repaired by means
of the statute labour, which is performed here with as much
reluctance, and as imperfectly, as any where, and had much

other parts of the parish.  The value of the meadow and

around Kirkwall are increasing of late, because the gentlemen
have taken several of them into their own hands, and joined
two or three of them together, in order to furnish provisions
for their families, as there are no public markets.  Some of
