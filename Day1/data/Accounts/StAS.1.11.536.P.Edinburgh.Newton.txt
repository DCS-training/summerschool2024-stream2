the horizon.  These seams vary in their thicknesses.  The
thickest of the flat seams are about 4 feet, and the thinnest
about 2 1/2.  The thickest of the edge seams are about 9 or 10
feet, and the thinnest about 2.  All of these seams have been
already wrought in part; some of them probably 200 years
ago; several of them by levels taken from the sea, and others
by levels from the lowest parts of these lands.  Some of the
flat seams, which are of the best quality, have been wrought
of late, and are still working by fire engines, and other ma-
chinery, 26 fathoms perpendicular depth below the sea.  There
still remain to be wrought a great quantity of there seams;
which, if ever attempted in any future period, will require
very powerful fire engines to drain the water from them, and
consequently a great outlay of money, before these coals can
he brought to market.

   Wages and Character.-The business of a collier seems to
be a very lucrative one.  Each of them may earn 18 s. or
20 s. per week.  It is however matter of much regret, that
very few instances are known, of such as are so attentive as to
save any thing at all.  On the contrary, it is the heavy com-
plaint of all the coal-masters, that a collier will work none,
so long as he has any money in his pocket.  This is the real
season of the scarcity of that article, which was so deeply and
universally felt during the course of last winter.

   Antiquities.-The only antiquity here, that deserves to be
taken notice of, is a very high ridge, of a circular form, and
of considerable extent, which evidently appears to be altoge-
ther artificial.  The people of the country have always called
it "The Kaim," a corruption, it is supposed, of the word
Camp.  If it is the remains of a camp, it could not be a Roman
one, as it is well known that their camps were of a square form
