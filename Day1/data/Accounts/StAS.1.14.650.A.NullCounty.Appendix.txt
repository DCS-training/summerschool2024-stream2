serted for that purpose.  The rocks on the S. W. side are
called the Keels; and ashore on this place lie all the boats
of the island.
   To the N. are situated the houses, which are confusedly
thrown together as chance, whim, or conveniency direct-
ed, into four clumps or towns, under the fine sounding
names of Shewah, Lioh, Bustah, and Gelah.  These 4
little towns, as they are called, contain the inhabitants, of
which there are 32 families, about 7 persons in each; 106
males, and 114 females; in all, 220.  Of these, there are
two, 100 years of age and upwards.

   The people in this island are increasing considerably in
number; for in the last 8 years, there have been 11 mar-
riages, 64 births, and only 27 funerals.  Since it came
into the hands of the present proprietor, who purchased
it at a judicial sale from the Sinclair of Quandel, the
population has increased one-fourth; and though it has
not been in his possession much above 20 years, it has
brought him nearly triple his purchase-money.  The causes
of this prosperity are various.  Their pasture ground is
very good; on which they have 400 sheep, whose wool
