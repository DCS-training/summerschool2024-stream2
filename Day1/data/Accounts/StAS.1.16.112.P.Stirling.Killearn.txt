and have grown to the tallness of nearly 100 feet.  For
beauty and size very few, if any of the kind in Scotland
surpass them.  In the vicinity of the larixes are many beau-
tiful spruce and beech trees, of uncommonly large dimen-
sions.  The oriental mapple, the sweet chesnut and tulip
trees have, in this place, arrived to great perfection and
beauty.

   Minerals, etc.-With respect to the mineral kingdom,
few things in this parish merit particular attention.  The
higher parts of the hills consist chiefly of a decomposible
whinstone, containing, in some places, small veins of an h‘-
matitical iron ore; but the quantity yet discovered is too
small to become an object of importance.  In some places
on the sides of the hills, are found many successive strata of
till and limestone.  These are beautifully displayed in se-
veral places where large excavations have been made by
means of water.  The limestone is of two kinds, and is
wrought but in small quantities.  The preferable kind is
not disposed in regular compact strata, but rather in irre-
gular masses, imbedded in a reddish clay blotched with
white.  The inferior kind is called camstone, from its being
chiefly sound in glens.  It is disposed in thin, but nume-
rous regular strata, separated from each other by a bluish
till, that, when acted upon by the weather, falls down into
clay.  The camstone, when broken, has a smooth surface;
it contains a great proportionable quantity of clay in its
composition; and after it is sufficiently burnt, and whilst
red hot in the fire, it must be slacked with water poured
upon it, otherwise it will not readily fall down into lime.
The strata are so thin, that they are not thought to be worth
working.  Fragments of the stone, which fall down from
the sides of the glens, are occasionally gathered for use.
Some varieties of it, which crumble down by exposure to
the weather, might, without being burnt, serve for the
