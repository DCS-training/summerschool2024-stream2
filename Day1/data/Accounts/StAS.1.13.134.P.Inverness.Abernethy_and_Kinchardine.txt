proprietors and the country.  But yet their coming to
the country was beneficial in many respects; for, besides
the knowledge and skill which was acquired from them, 
they made many useful and lasting improvements.  They
made roads through the woods.  They erectd proper saw-
mills.  They invented the construction of the raft, as it is
at present, and cut a passage through a rock in Spey, with-
out which, floating to any extent could never be at-
tempted.  Before their time, some small trisling rafts were
sent down Spey in a very awkward and bazardous manner, 
10 or 12 dozen of deals, buddled together, conducted by a 
man, sitting in what was called a Currach, made of a hide,
in the shape, and about the size of a small brewing-kettle,
broader above than below, with ribs or hoops of wood in
the inside, and a cross-stick for the man to fit on; who, 
with a paddle in his hand, went before the raft, to which
his currach was tied with a rope.  This rope had a run-
ning-knot or loup round the man's knee in the currach, so
that if the raft stopt on a stone, or any other way, he
loosed the knot, and let his currach go on, otherwise it
would sink in a strong stream, and when after coming in 
behind the raft again, and loosing it, be proceeded again to
make the belt of his way.  These currachs were so light,
that the men carried them on their backs home from
Speymouth.  There is one of them now in the parish of
Cremdale below this.  The York-building Company had
18 of these currachs in their employ at first, with which
they made little progress, till Mr Aaron Hill, one of
thier number, constructed the large raft, as it is at pre-
sent, consisting of two or three branders of spars in 
the bottom, joined end to end, with iron or other
loups, and rope through them, and conducted by two
men, one at each end, who have each a seat and oar, with
which they keep the raft in the proper direction.  It is
