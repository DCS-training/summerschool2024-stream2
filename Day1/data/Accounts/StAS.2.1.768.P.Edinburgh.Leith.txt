graving-docks L. 18, 198, the drawbridges L. 11,281, and the areas
for the sites of the docks and warehouses L. 80,543,-amounting
to L.285,108, exclusive of L. 8000 for constructing the upper
drawbridge over the Water of Leith, in the line of the new street
leading from the foot of the Tolbooth Wynd to the centre of the
first wet-dock."
   The city of Edinburgh by its charters possessed the whole of
the shore dues levied at the ports of Leith and Newhaven, with
the exception of the merk per ton, the proceeds of which were
appropriated to the payment of the clergy of Edinburgh.
The sums advanced by Government towards the construction of
the docks and harbour are as follow: The first loan took place
in 1800, when L. 25,000 were advanced. The next advance was
in 1805, when a second sum of L. 25,000 was lent at five per cent.
interest. Subsequent to this loan, the first sum of L. 25,000 was
paid up. During the next twenty years, the authorities of the
city of Edinburgh had, under various acts of Parliament, borrowed
L. 240,000 for the purposes of the docks, beyond the L. 25,000
which they owed to Government. By an act dated 1825, (6
Geo. IV. c. 103,) the Treasury was authorised to make a farther
advance of L. 240,000 out of the Consolidated Fund, to enable
the authorities of the city of Edinburgh to take up the bonds
which they had issued. This advance was made at the rate of
five per cent., of which three per cent. was to be the rate of inte-
rest, and two per cent. was to go to a sinking fund. By one of
the clauses, however, of the same act, this annual payment was
reduced to the rate of four per cent. for twelve years, in considera-
tion of an agreement entered into by the corporation with the
Commissioners of the Navy to extend the eastern pier, and im-
prove the works there with connected. The security given to Go-
vernment was a preferable claim over the whole of the dock and
harbour property, and a concurrent claim with other creditors over
the entire property of the city of Edinburgh. Other stipulations
were connected with this transaction, by which a part of the
docks and shore ground was ceded to the Admiralty.
   In 1833, when the city of Edinburgh became insolvent, the
operation of the sinking fund had cleared off L. 25,000 of the ad-
vanced sums, so that the debt then due to Government amounted
to L. 240,000. After various and protracted negotiations with the
Government and city creditors, an agreement was at last come to, and
an act of Parliament (proceeding on Reports of Select Committee
