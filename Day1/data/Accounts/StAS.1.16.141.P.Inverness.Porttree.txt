however, from being unwholsome, is sufficiently evinced
by experience; for the inhabitants are, in general, as strong
and healthy, and arrive at as advanced an age, as those who
live in milder climates, and under a serener sky.  The
gout is not known as a distemper affecting the inhabitants.

   Hills, Woods, Lakes, and Rivers.-The most remarkable
hill in the parish, is that which, W. S. W. of the harbour,
rises above it, first, with an easy and gentle acclivity, but
becomes steeper nearer the top.  It is called Ait Suidhe
Thuin, or Fingal's sitting place, because on the top of it is
a green hillock, on which, says tradition, Fingal was wont
to sit in state, point out the different courses, and survey
his heroes pursuing the chace.  From this hillock, in a
clear day, the losty hills of Cuillin and Strath, the parishes
of Duirinish and Bracadale, the Long Island, North and
South Uist, and Barra may be seen; as likewise the west
side of Troternish, Portree, Raasay, Applecross, Loch-
Carron, and the interjacent seas.  The sides of the hill are
covered with several farms of different sizes; and, except
in some places N. and S. and towards the top, which is
either rocky, or covered with heath, the whole is good pa-
sture or arable ground.  Nearly opposite to this hill, at a
mile's distance, S. E. of the harbour, rises Bein-Dean-a-
bhaig, or the hill of his defence, having also on its top a
green hillock, called Cruachan Mhic Swain, (Macswain's
eminence), remarkable only for its similarity to that on
the top of Ait Suidhe Thuin, excepting the tradition, that
a son of Swain, or Sueno, a Danish or Norwegian king, lies
buried there, may be thought deserving of notice.  On the
side of Bein-Dian-a-bhaig, that looks towards Raasay, and
which is extremely steep, rises a number of rocks of coni-
cal form, green at their tops, or covered with heath; be-
