   Upon the whole, though a regular and judicious rotation
of crops is not generally established, and though much of
the old system of farming remains, it gives pleasure to ob-
serve, that the spirit of improvement is rapidly extending its
happy influence.  The advantages of fallow and green crops
are generally known, and the number of acres under turnip,
potatoe, and sown grass is annually increasing.  In different
parts of the parish farms are to be found, which exhibit spe-
cimens of extensive improvement and skill in the manage-
ment of them.  Of these none has a juster claim to be par-
ticularly mentioned, than that of Haughs of Ashogle, posses-
sed by George Gerard of Atidstrath.  In the year 1780,
when his lease commenced, the produce of the farm was hard-
ly sufficient to maintain the servants and cattle necessary to
work it.  Since that time, upwards of 200 acres, of which
a great part was formerly entirely barren, and the rest in a
very impoverished state, have been brought to produce weigh-
ty crops of corn and grass.  The rotation adopted by Mr
Gerard, is oats, turnip, and sown grass for three or four years.
The produce of this farm, which in the year 1780 was only
900 threaves, amounted to 2700 threaves in the year 1790.
By the melioration of the soil and pasture, the number of
cattle has been increased, and the breed improved in the same
proportion.  In 1780 the hill pasture, which could then main-
tain a stock of sheep of the Scotch breed only, the medium va-
lue of which did not exceed 6 s. a head, now maintains a
flock of a mixed breed in the proportion of 2/3 English to 1/3
Scotch, the wethers of which give from 18 s to 20 s. each.
   In a similar manner, the farm of Mains of Torrie is mana-
