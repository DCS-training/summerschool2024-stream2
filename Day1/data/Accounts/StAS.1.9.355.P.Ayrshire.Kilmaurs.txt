brought into the parish by servants from great towns,
whose parents or relations reside here.  Many epidemical
diseases might be warded off from a whole country, if li-
beral contributions were made for building and maintain-
ing infirmaries, in which the sick and diseased among the
poor would find a comfortable retreat, and the necessary
advantages of medical aid.  Donations for this purpose
are the very essence of charity, which assimilates men to
the Supreme Being, whose providential care extends to all
his creatures*.

*Inoculation for the small pox hath not yet become general, owing
to the prevalence of a religious persuasion, that the Divine Government,
without any care on the part of man, will accomplish whatever is best
for him.  So deeply are the tenets of this kind impressed, that all attempts
to show the necessity of using those means by which the Providence of
God operates, both in temporal and spiritual concerns, are houted and
despised Much have the seache s of Religion to answer for who esta
blish faith upon the ruins of practice.  The number of deaths, and the
diseases which prove mortal, cannot be ascertained, no register of them
having been kept.  Births are also for the same reason unknown.
