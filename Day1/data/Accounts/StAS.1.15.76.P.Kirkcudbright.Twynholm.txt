     Statistical Account

the extent is about 9 mies by 2; though, from the remotest
house in the one end to the remotest house in the other, the
direct distance will not bemuch above 6 miles.  The river Dee
divides them from Kirkcudbright, upon the S. S. E. and S.
E. and the water of Tarf from Tongland upon the E: A
small bay of the sea washes the coast from the W. to the S.

   Surface and Soil.-The surface is mostly high-land, and, seen
at a distance, looks like an elevated plain; but when entered
upon, it rises into knolls and arable hills, with small valleys and
some merse land upon the borders of the Tarf and the Dee,
until you approach the extremity towards the N. W. by N.,
when the view is bounded by hills covered with heath.-
The soil is various, and generally formed from rag, and what is
called in this country, rotten stone, decompounded by the in-
fluence of sun and air, etc. and fallen into earth.  A great part
of the soil lies upon this kind of rock, and some of it upon
a till bottom.  There are clay, moss, gravelly, and sandy
soils, though very little of this last.  In general, the soil is
light, dry and rich, and, when properly managed; repays the
industrious farmer with exuberant crops of grass and corn.

   Climate and Diseases.-A good deal of rain falls generally
upon the west coast, and these parishes have their share of
it, but not more than what is necessary, considering the dry-
ness of the soil.-Bordering upon the Western Ocean, our
frosts in winter are of short continuance, and snow very sel-
dom lies so long, as to do material damage to the store far-
mer.  The height of the ground in general, the dryness of the
soil, and the sea air, all contribute to the health of the inha-
bitants; so that for 31 years, no epidemical disease* has
