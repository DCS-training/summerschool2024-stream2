     Statistical Account

a year, is spring and autumn; when the former would have
opportunities of inquiring into the plans adopted by the latter,
in the management of their farms, and of giving seasonable
advices to the slothful, and suitable approbation and encou-
ragement to the industrious.  At these meetings, at which 
the proprietors and minister might officiate in rotation, as pre-
sidents, a collection should be made by voluntary assessment,
according to the different circumstances and inclinations of the 
members, out of which, after desraying the expences of the 
meeting, which should never exceed 1 s. 6 d. each, the surplus 
should be converted into a fund for encouraging industry a-
mong the cottagers.  Out of this fund, small premiums from 
5 s. to 10 s. might be distributed to 4 or 5 cottagers yearly,
who should raise the best turnips or grass upon not less than 1/4
of an acre each.  By a judicious and impartial distribution of these 
small premiums, a spirit of industry and emulation would be ex-
cited among the cottagers; their crops of grass and grain would 
be more pentiful, and their situation and circumstances would
become much more comfortable.  By such periodical meetings 
landlords would become thoroughly acquainted with the situa-
tion, management, and conduct both of the tenants and cot-
tager; those ties which unite men to men would be drawn 
tighter and closer; sentiments of respect and gratitude-of at-
tachment and confidence, would spontaneously arise and ex-
pand, in the hearts of the tenants towards their landlords, 
whom they would thus be induced to consider as their patrons 
and protectors; and, by this primitive and patriarchal kind of 
intercourse, so agreeable to a benevolent mind, the general 
harmony and happiness of social life would be improved and 
augmented.
