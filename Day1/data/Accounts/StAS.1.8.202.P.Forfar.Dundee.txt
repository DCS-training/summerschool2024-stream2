ticles, and incapable of being so smoothly polished as the
stone from some other quarries, particularly those of Craigie
and Invergourie, it is much more durable, and in many parts
of the great steeple, built from it, in the 12th century, espe-
cially in the higher and more exposed parts, the marks of the
chissel are still visible.  The colour is grey, inclining a little
to blue.  Another sand-stone of a redish colour and softer
texture, is found immediately west from the town, and at high
water generally covered by the tide; but it is so perishable as
to be or little use.  We have no figured stones, no petrifac-
tions, no limestone or marble, and no granite or other alpine
stone, except a few loose and detached pieces, which bear the
appearance of being rounded by water.  A very small quan-
tity of grey state is found in the free-stone quarries on the
lands of Craigie; but it is nothing different from the rest of
the quarry, except that it splits into thinner strata.  There
are no mines of any kind, nor any mineral springs except
two, and there so slightly tinged with iron, as hardly to de-
serve the name.  Some excellent springs break out near the
town, at the bottom of the Law, one especially called the La-
dy Well, whose waters are conveyed in leaden pipes through
the different streets of the town, and supply the greatest part
of it.  The waters from molt of these, on boiling, leave a
stony crust on the vessels employed for that purpose any con-
siderable time; but we have no springs which, with propriety,
can be called petrifying.

   Coast Tides, etc.-The Tay is between 2 and 3 miles broad,
where it bounds the parish, and it extends nearly along its ut-
most length.  The adjacent coati is generally high and rocky.
At the west end, along the lands of Balgay, it is perpendicu-
lar, and more than 40 feet high; along those of Blackness it
falls lower, till, in approaching the town, it becomes a preci-
