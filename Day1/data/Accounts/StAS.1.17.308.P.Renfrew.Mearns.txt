   The rent of land is high.  Exclusive of the moor, it may
be, on an average, 26 s. per acre Some parts of it are let
in pasture at 50 s. per acre; and there are some consider-
able proprietor, who can let the whole of their lands for
pasture, at 44 s. per acre.  About 26 years ago, the average
rent was not above 7 s. or 6 s. per acre.  The lands then
were not inclosed, and it was usual to have a great part
of them in constant village, which gave the most in serable
returns; and what was in pasture was always overlocked
with cattle, which were therefore kept in a starving condi-
tion.  The profits of the farmers, of consequence were small,
he paid his rent with difficulty, aptt lived poorly.  The in-
closing of the lands, and in industrious and judicious ma-
nagement of them, as well as the increase in the value of the
articles of produce, enable the present tenants to live com-
fortably, and to pay their rents with punctuality -The va-
lued rent of the parish is 471 L. 6 s. 6 d. Scots.  The real
rent is probably near 5000 L. Sterling.
