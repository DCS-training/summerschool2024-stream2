that those days were often disgraced by doings of a more atro-
cious character.  This manuscript, which is in the library of Tay-
mouth, is of the nature of a Diary.  The writer was a Roman Catho-
lic. probably Vicar of Inchadyn or Fortingal, and lived several years
before the end of the sixteenth century. Among the variety of
curious things stated in that manuscript I find mention frequently
made of bloody feud and murders among the people.  An event of
either description hardly now occurs in a lifetime. There is an-
other manuscript to which I may refer here.  It is known by the name
of the " Black Book of Taymouth." It is chiefly occupied with a
genealogical account of the Glenarquhay family and the narra-
tion of facts and incidents connected with the lives of the Barons
of that house.
     Breadalbane Family.-In the outset of that manuscript it is stated,
that " Duncan Campbell, commonly callit Duncan in Aa, Knight
of Lochow (lineallie descendit of an valiant man, surnamit Camp-
bell, quha cam to Scotland in King Malcom Kandmoir his tyme,
about the year of God 1067, of quhom cam the house of Lochow),
flourisched in King David Bruce his dayes.  The foresaid Dun-
can in Aa had to wyffe Margarit Stewart, dochter to Duke Mur-
doch; on quhom he begat twa sones, the elder callit  Archibald,
the other namit Colin, wha was first Laird of Gienurquhay." The
following table exhibits a view of the succession in the family, from
1432 to the present day.
