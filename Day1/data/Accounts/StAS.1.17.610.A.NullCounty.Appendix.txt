'Sir James Clerk, and had his approbation.'  In summer
1788 Mr Tytler, when on a visit to the present proprietor,
enumerated among those to whom he here referred, President
Forbes, Baron Sir John, and William Clerk his brother, of
Pennycuick, Dr Clerk, and Provost Lindsay of Edinburgh,
and also pointed out the room that had been usually occupied
by himself.  Of the two first scenes particularly condescended
on, and which indeed contain all the first act, and most of
the picturesque scenery in the poem.  The first is,
     Beneath the south side of a craggy bield,
     Where christal springs the halesome waters yield:
     And the second,
     A flowrie howm between twa verdant braes,
     Where lasses use to wash and spread their claiths;
     A trotting burnie wimphng through the ground,
     It's channel peebles shining smooth and round:
     JENNY.
     Come, Meg, let's fa' to wark upon this green,
     This shinning day will bleach our linen clean;
     The water clear, the lift unclouded blew,
     Will mak them like a lily wet wi' dew.
     PEGGY.

     
     Gae farer up the burn to Habbie's How,
     Where a' the sweets of spring and simmer grow,
     Between twa birks, out o'er a little lin,
     The water fa's and maks a singand din;
     A pool breast deep, beneath as clear as glass:
     Kisses wi' easy whirls the bord'ring grass:
     We'll end our washing while the morning's cool;
     And when the day grows het, we'll to the pool,
     There wash oursells-
