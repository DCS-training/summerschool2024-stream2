teacher of mathematics; and both are very fit for lodging

   In this business, the administrators are happy in having
the assistance and support of several very respectable gentle-
men of the county of Ross, who are named Visitors of the Aca-
demy, to observe that the regulations be properly attended to;
and each of these has the privilege of sending to it any young
man they please, to be educated without paying fees to the
masters.  The institution is yet in its infancy; but, from a
variety of circumstances, there is little doubt of its success.  A
finer or healthier situation for such a seminary, is not to be found
in Scotland; and, as there is now a very frequent intercourse
by trading vessels, this affords a cheap and easy conveyance
to Fortrose from London, Leith, and other principal sea ports;
and students who attend here, among many other advantages
in point of health, may have the benefit of excellent sea
bathing.
   The present visitors are, Sir Hector Munro of Novar, K. B.;
Francis Humberston M'Kenzie of Seaforth; Sir Hugh Munro
of Fowlis, Bart.; Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, Bart.; Sir
Hector M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart.; Donald M'Leod, Esq.
of Geanies, sherriff-depute of Ross and Gromarty; Charles
M'Kenzie, Esq. of Kilcoy; Kenneth Murchison, Esq. of Tar-
radale; David Urquhart, Esq. of Braelangwell; and Robert
Bruce AEneas M'Leod, Esq. of Cadboll.  To these, other gen-
tlemen will be added from time to time, who prove bene-
factors to the academy.
   The administrators will require about 300 L. more, to com-
plete their plan, in finishing the buildings, purchasing mathe-
matical instruments, and making up a decent library, which
they hope yet to be supplied with by the liberality of the
public.  They find that this business occupies much of their
time, and has been attended with no small personal trouble;
