     University and King's College of Aberdeen.

   Professor of Divinity.-About the year 1620, a professor
of divinity was added to the founded members of the Uni-
versity, by contributions from the bishop and clergy of the
diocese of Aberdeen; and the election of the professor vested
in the moderator of the provincial synod of Aberdeen, with
two delegates from each of the eight presbyterics which con-
stitute the synod, the Principal and dean of the faculty of
theology of King's College, together with another of its mem-
bers chosen by the Collage for that purpose.-The money be-
longing to this fund was some time after employed in pur-
chasing lands in the parish of Kirmellar; on which King
Charles the First granted a charter, dated March 12th, 1642,
in favour of Mr Adam Barclay, then professor of divinity,
and his successors in office.  In this charter are inserted the
rules relating to the election of a professor, and the powers
of the synod, with respect to his office and revenues.  The
election is to be made on a comparative trial, after issuing
programs for that purpose; and the different heads of ex-
amination are particularly specified.  In 1753, the synod, on
the representation of Professor Lumsden, the then incum-
bent, feued the above hands in perpetuum to the College.

   Revenue of the See of Aberdeen granted to the King's and Ma-
rischal Colleges.-Upon the abolition of Episcopacy in Scot-
land, in the year 1641, King Charles I. granted the revenue
of the see of Aberdeen to the King's and Marischal Colleges,
assigning two third parts to King's College: which gift was
ratified in Parliament, (unprinted Act 169), and by his royal
charter he united them under the name of "The Caroline
University."  This union was confirmed by Oliver Cromwell,
A. D. 1654, and continued till the Restoration; when Act
15th, Parl. 1, Charles II. and Act 1st, Sess. 2d, rescinding
all the Acts of the Parliament 1640, restoring Episcopacy,
