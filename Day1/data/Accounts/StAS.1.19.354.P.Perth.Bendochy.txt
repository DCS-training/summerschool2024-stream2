     Statistical Account

last year, brought L 10 Sterling.  Horses sell from L. 12
to L. 20 Sterling; a horse will draw 80 stone of coals
from Perth, on a cart.  There are no sheep kept in the low
country part of the parish, but some in the Highlands.  We
have no asses here, but some swine.

   Butter and Cheese.-There is a good deal of butter and
cheese made; but the cheese is less valuable than it would
be, by wanting the substance of the butter.  Butter sells at
10 d. the pound of 20 ounces Scotch, equal to 22 ounces
English avoirdupois.  Merchants retail it salted during win-
ter, giving 16 ounces English for a pound, by which the
unwary purchaser loses 6 ounces.  Cheese is sold by the
country people (22 lb.  English avoirdupois to the stone)
at 4 s. 6 d. and is retailed by the merchants at 16 of these
pounds to the stone.  There are grievous evils to the poor,
land originate from not restricting the inhabitants, effica-
ciously, to the use only of one weight and one measure.  I
have known an instance in churning butter, in which the
cream, after more than ordinary labour, cast up only one
pound of butter instead of four, which it ought.  By standing
a while to cool and having the labour repeated over again,
it cast up the other three pounds of butter.

     When Kitty kirned, and there nae butter came,
     Ye, Manse, gat a' the wyte.  ALLAN RAMSAY.

   Yarn.-There is a good deal of linen yarn spun in the
parish, and some of it is weaved.  The women spin with
both hands, 10 hairs a-day.  The price of yarn has been as
variable, of late, as that of victual, from 25 d. to 43 d. the
spindle.  They spin 12 hairs, sale yarn, out of the English
pound avoirdupois.
