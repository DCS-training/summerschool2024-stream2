price at shipping there is 3 s. 6 d. a cart; but the river-dues,
or tonnage-duty, etc. nearly double the price at Rothesay.
The price of provisions, till within these twenty or twenty-
five years, was moderate; but, during that period, had been
gradually rising, and is now regulated, in a great measure, by
the Greenock market, one of the dearest in Scotland.  The
price of labour of all kinds has advanced greatly within these
few years.  A day labourer, about twenty years ago, could
have been hired for 6 d 7 d. or 8 d. a day; but now they re-

belonging to the parish, except one or two half-decked
barks of about fifteen tons for carrying coals, were open

three men and a boy; and of these there might be from a
hundred to a hundred and twenty.  But now, besides, from
twelve to twenty of open boats, there may be between eignty
and a hundred vessels belonging to the parish, from fifteen to
one hundred tons burden.

   During the last war, there were a number of seamen from
the parish in the navy service;  and, had the prize-money due
to them been properly accounted for, it is believed that press-
warrant would have been unnecessary;  here, but, as matters
are at present managed, nothing but compulsion will induce
them to enter into the navy service.  Many of them, to 
whom price-money is due, can get no account of, nor even
find out the agent in whose hand it is.  Would it not an-
