                           Total land in the parish of Craigie,  6300 acres.

	The average size of the farms is about 90 imperial acres. The
above is exclusive of the turnpike and parish roads, and of that
part of Loch Brown that is flooded in summer, so that the whole
contents of this parish are above tdn square miles. The produce
of the oats per acre is from thirty-two to sixty-four imperial bushels,
average forty-eight bushels per acre. The average produce of
beans is twenty-four bushels per acre. Potatoes average about
eight tons per acre; turnips average about sixteen tons per
acre: ryegrass weighs about twenty-six cwt. of 112 lbs. each;
and meadow bay weiahs about twenty-eight ewt. per imperial
acre on an average. Pease are included along with the beans.
Perhaps there may be five or six acres of pease. The barley is
mostly sown for family use. Little flax is sown, and few field-cab-
bages are raised, perhaps not more than an acre of each.
	Live-Stock.--The live-stock is as follows: 148 horses and mares
6t for work; 25 bulls, 759 milk cows; 437 young cows, including
queys, stirks, and calves to be reared: 293 sheep, mostly of a mixed
breed; and 145 swine. The milk of the cows is for the most
part manufactured into sweet milk cheese, and the yearly produce
of each cow is from 2 1/2 cwt. to 3 1/2 cwt. ; the ave	is 3 cwt.
The whey is mostly used in feeding swine.
