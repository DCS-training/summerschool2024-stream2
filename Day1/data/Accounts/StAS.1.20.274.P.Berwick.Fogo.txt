   Rents.-The proven rental of the parish, in the late pro-
cess of augmentation, was L. 2180.
   Considerable improvements have of late been made on
the property in the parish, as inclosing, liming, draining,
etc.  One of the heritors, and one or two of the principal
farmers, have made not a few improvements, but by far 
the greatest part of them have been done by the tenants at

which was formerly considered as sufficiently large for one
person to occupy.  The population, in 1755, according to 
Dr Webster's account, was 566 souls.  It may be now sta-

with three corn-mills.  Thrashing-machines are beginning 
to make their appearance, being introduced by one or two 
of the farmers.  Since the year 1780, there have been re-
