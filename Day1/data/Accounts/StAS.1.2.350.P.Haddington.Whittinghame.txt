Dumpender-law; but after Mary Queen of Scotland, so fa-
mous in history, was carried off by the Earl of Bothwell, to
Hails-castle, which stands to the north, on Tyne river, about
an English mile below, it was called Traprene law, from the
two French words trape and reine.  From the summit of this
law, there is one of the finest prospects in Scotland, taking in
East and Mid Lothian, the county of Fife, the isle of May,
