     OBSERVATIONS on the foregoing TABLE.

   THE number of the inhabitants, as stated in the table, is from actual enu-
meration: so is the number of tradesmen, and those of other occupations.
Their ages are as near the truth, as could be obtained, and it is presumed,
pretty accurate.  The small decrease of the inhabitants of this parish since the
year 1769, is not owing to the number of deaths exceeding the births, as ap-
pears from the table; but to a constant drain of young people, who leave the
parish.  Many of the young men, despairing of getting a comfortable, or in-
deed any kind of settlement here, remove to towns, either to learn or prose-
cute their respective trades; others of them to such places as give higher wages
to farm-servants.  And young women repair to towns, where they are em-
ployed as servants, and not only to the neighbouring towns of Aberdeen, Banff,
etc. but even to Edinburgh and London.  Besides, in this current year, a great-
er number than ordinary have died, several young people of putrid sore throats,
but the greater part old people.  The people here are very inattentive to the
registrating their children's births or baptism; so that no authentick informa-
tion can be got from the parish register; but the annual average of births, ac-
cording to the register, and making allowance for such as may have been ne-
glected to be registrated, may amount to the number stated in the table.  No
register of deaths or burials was kept here, till the late act of parliament lay-
ing a tax upon burials, etc.  Since that time, the schoolmaster has kept role.
but many people are averse to the measure of registrating their friend's death;
beside, several of the parishioners of Aberdour are buried elsewhere, and stran-
