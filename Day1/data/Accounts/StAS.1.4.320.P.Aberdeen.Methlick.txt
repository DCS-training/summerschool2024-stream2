     NUMBER XLIII.

     PARISH OF METHLICK,

     (COUNTY OF ABERDEEN.)

     By the Rev. Mr ALEXANDER KNOLLS.

     Situation, Surface, Soil, River, etc.

   METHLICK is in the presbytery of Ellon, and Synod
of Aberdeen.  The extent of the parish from S. to
N.is 5 miles, from E. to W. 6.  It is bounded by the pa-
rishes of Ellon, Tarves, Fyvie, Monwhitter, and New
Deer.  The appearance of the country is rather hilly than
slat.  The hills are covered with heath, verdure, and crops
of oats.  The nature of the soil is neither very fertile nor
very barren.-The small river Ithan is the only one in the
parish, and which falls into the sea about 10 computed
miles below, to the E.  it produces excellent trout in
great abundance, and now and then salmon are caught as
far up as this, and would be often found here, were it
not that there are cruives about 6 miles below.  In the au-
tumn, salmon come up this length to spawn, and abun-
dance of pearl has been found in the river here.  Ithan is
a slow running stream; there are few fords in it below this,
and it might be rendered navigable, at no great expence,
for large boats.
