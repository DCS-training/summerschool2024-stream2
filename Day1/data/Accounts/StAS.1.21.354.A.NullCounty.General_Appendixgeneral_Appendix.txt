coal and lime by the tide-way of the Forth on the plan of
1774, or from Bannockburn and Murrayshall by a new ca-
nal to the Forth at Baad.  It is plain that the canal to Ban-
nockburn would be more expensive than the works at Craig-
forth: but, in place of 3 miles of water carriage from Baad to
Bannockburn, you would have at least 49 miles of water car-
riage from Baad to Lord Elgin's lime kilns, and near 30 miles
of water carriage to the coalworks on the Devon, beyond
Rackmill.
   The navigation of the Teith would be much more expen-
sive than the Forth, because the river has a greater fall.
From the tide-way of the Forth, or from the junction of the
two rivers, to Down, a space of 3 miles, one lock might be
sufficient, as the river has no considerable fall along this
stretch.  From the estimates in 1774 of the Devon naviga-
tion, we think the canal to Down would not have cost much
more than 4000 l. sterling at that period.  Between Down
and Callander, a stretch of 8 miles, would be very difficult
and expensive, the banks of the river being rocky in many
places.  The fall of the river is, however, pretty gradual;
and it is thought that, by clearing the bed, it might be ren-
dered fit for small drag-boats.  The only impediment to this
plan is the rugged banks, which the stream, in time of floods,
has rendered inaccessible in many places; and it would require
very strong embankments to defend a towing path.
   These difficulties, though great, should not however pre-
vent an accurate survey and calculation.  It is proper to keep
in view the value of this river: such a fine body of water,
capable of moving the largest machinery for the space of 12
miles, is an object not to be met with everywhere.  It is in
the centre of the kingdom, and immediate neighbourhood of
a very rich country, and its banks furnish stone for all kinds
of buildings.  From Callander to Lochlubnaig, the Teith
