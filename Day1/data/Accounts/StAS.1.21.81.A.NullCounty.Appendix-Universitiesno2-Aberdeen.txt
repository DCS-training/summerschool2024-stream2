   Revenue.-It has been already mentioned that the revenue
of the University was originally set apart for the support of
42 persons, of whom 21 were in priests orders.  These are
now reduced to 23 in consequence of the change in religion
and deficiency of funds.  Since the time of King James VI.
no additional provision has been made either by public grants
or private donations for the founded members of this literary
seminary, except 93 l. 6 s. 8 d. sterling, included in King Wil-
liam's mortification of the bishops rents; and 91 l. 8 s. ster-
ling, granted by Queen Anne, and hitherto continued by her
royal successors.-Of two of the parishes united to the Uni-
versity, the tithes have been long since exhausted in provid-
ing legal stipends for their ministers; more than one half of
a third parish is overblown with sand; and no less than three
additional stipends have been brought upon the other tithes
belonging to the University, by new erections of parishes; so
that the whole revenue for the support of the buildings, the
sustenance of the Principal, and 7 professors, 13 bursars in
arts, a provisor, and 2 servants, all the public and necessary
annual expences of the College, and stipends for 8 ministers,
consists of the tithes of only 6 parishes and a half; about 63 l.
from feu duties and annuities; 184 l. 14 s. 8 d. from royal
bounties since the Revolution, and the interest of the fund
arising from the sale of superiorities and patronages.  Of these
funds too, the tithes (originally the most considerable branch)
are much exhausted, in consequence of the augmentations
lately awarded by the Court of Teinds, to the ministers of
