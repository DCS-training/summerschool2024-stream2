with greater accuracy, whole Langholm church-yard, and
the church-yards of Wauchope and Staplegordon are still
used by many families to bury.

   Manufactures, etc.- A branch of the cotton manufac-
ture was established about 4 years ago in New Langholm, 
which employed from 80 to 100 people; but by the late 
shock of commercial credit, which has deranged the Com-
pany's affairs, it has been at a stand since July last.  There
is every reason however to think, that from the many of-
fers already made for a lease of the houses, utencils, etc.
it will soon be resumed.  Fortunately for the weavers,
most, if not all of them, are now employed by Messrs For-
restler and Fergusson, two respectable manufacturers in Car-
lisle, in weaving checks, etc. (so called, from being chec
quered or striped;) by which means, they are kept from
emigrating into other parts of the country in quest of
bread for themeselves and their families.  The manufac-
ture of checks and thread has lately been begun in Lang-
holm, and promises to succeed.  During the last year, one
man alone, Mr Carruthers, manufactured and sold above 
20,000 yards of checks, and other coarse linens.  Stoc-
kings have also begun to be manufactured, and such al-
ready is the demand for them, that the manufacturer can-
not answer his orders.  They are sold at from 2 s. to 5 s.
a-pair.  Considering all the advantages which Langholm
enjoys, it is matter of surprise, that a woollen manufac-
ture, upon an extensive scale, has not long ago been esta-
blished.  Inexhaustible mosses, within 2 miles of the town,
furnish peat in abundance at 1 s.  6 d.  the cart-load, and
coal is sold at the pit at the same price, and delivered at
Langholm, at the average of 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. the cart.  By
