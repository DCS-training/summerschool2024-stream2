man and two horses.  This country, however, is in every re-
spect ill adapted for tillage; there is very little land capable
of being ploughed, little sun-shine to ripen, or dry weather to
preserve the crops.  The present sowing of this very exten-
sive parish, is only 230 bolls of oats. and 25 bolls of bear.
The small quantity of grain that is sown, does not yield good
returns; oats generally yield three feeds and a half, and bear
from four to five feeds; nor will the ground produce even
these scanty crops, without constant manure.  Oats are sown
from the 6th to the 26th of April, and bear the second and
third weeks of May.  The harvest begins in September, and
the crops are seldom completely safe before the end of Octo-
ber; in wet seasons the harvest is still later.  Potatoes are
much cultivated, and they produce plentifully; there are
about 150 bolls planted annually.  The hay harvest, how-
ever, is the most important, and occupies the attention, and
the labour of the people, more or less, from the end of July
to the end of October.

   Fish.-There are in this parish two small water lakes,
which afford abundance of trout, of a small size, but of a most
delicious taste and flavour; these trouts are killed with the rod,
and take the hook readiest in the months of May and June.
In the rivers Goil, Fine, and Long, there are burn trouts of dif-
ferent sizes, and near the coast, sea trout and salmon.  Loch-
fine, Loch-long, and Loch-goil, abound in great variety of
excellent fish; at all seasons of the year, there are haddocks,
whitings, and codlings; they are killed either with the hand
line, or with the long line.  The haddocks in Loch-goil are
more numerous, and of a larger size, than in those parts of
Loch-fine, and Loch-long, which belong to this parish.  In
consequence of the ready access from Loch-goil, and Loch-long,
to Greenock, Port-Glasgow, Glasgow, and Paisley, consider-
