L. 3, 10 s. to L. 4 Sterling; and those fold by the lower
class of tenants fetch from two to three guineas each.  The
estate of Scothouse, as also a great part of Glengarrry's pro-
perty, together with one farm on Macleod's estate, are
mostly laid out in sheep walks; the sheep are of the black-
faced kind, and are thought to be good, as the wedders of
three years old, reared on two of the farms, have hitherto
given from 15 s. to 16 s. each at an average.  The white
wool fells from 6 s. to 8 s. and the tared wool from 4 s. to
6 s. the stone.  The quantity sold is supposed to be up-
wards of 1500 stones, Greenock, Dumbarton, and Liver-

also disposed of to the country people.  Emigration is thought
to be owing in a great measure to the introduction of sheep,
as one man often rents a farm where formerly many fa-
milies lived comfortably; and if the rage for this mode of
farming goes on with the same rapidity it has done for
some years back, it is to be apprehended emigration will
still increase.  But this is not solely the cause; the high
rents demanded by landlords, the increase of population,
and the flattering accounts received from their friends in
America, do also contribute to the evil.

   Fish.-Skate, ling, and cod are to be got along the coast
of the parish, but sythe or pollock is caught in the greatest
abundance, which in summer is chiefly the support of the
poor people.  The herring-fishing deserves to be particu-
larly mentioned, as in Lochurn they make their appearance
so early as July, and continue from that period to the mid-
dle of autumn.  Here the busses from the frith of Clyde
commonly assemble first, besides a vast number of boats, which
croud together from the neighbouring parishes and isles ad-
jacent.  It is computed for some years back 30,000 barrels
have been annually caught in this loch; but the want of
