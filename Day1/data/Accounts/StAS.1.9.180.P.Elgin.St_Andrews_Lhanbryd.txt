ornamental, and promote the growth of grass, by their shade
and their shelter.  The tenant at present has seldom any
encouragement to plant such spots, as, by act of Parliament,
all the growing timber is the sole property of the landlord.
But were some arrangement made between the landlord
and the tenant, to encourage the latter, either to plant such
spots himself, or to take care of the trees therein planted,
every farm, in the course of the rising generation, would

occasioned by an emigration of many of that rank to the

in all circumstances, by the fashion or practice of other
farms, which themselves have by this means established;
and if any person contends any particular with them, he
thereby incurs the imputation of being a bad master, and
must thereupon, at the next term, give an advance of wages,
or some concession still more humiliating.  How far this
may or does affect the land-rent, is not ascertained, nor

their poorer neighbours, and to the state of the country in
general; and it is yet practicable, by a little concert among
