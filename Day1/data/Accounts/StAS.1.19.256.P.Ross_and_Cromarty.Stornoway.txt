     Statistical Account

   The air is moist, but agrees well with the natives.  The
prevailing distempers are the same with those stated in the
account of the parish of Uig.  The moor in this parish
abounds in lakes.  There are six small rivulets.  The fresh-
water lakes contain great quantities of small trout.  Three
of the rivulets produce some salmon and sea-trout.  The
salmon is sold fresh at 1 d. per English pound in Stornoway.
Their fish is very poor; they are best in July and August.
The length of the sea-coast is 25 computed miles; the shore
in some places is rocky, and in some flat and sandy.
   There is a great quantity of ling on the coast, and a few
cods, both of which are well cured and dried by the coun-

to the Stornoway merchants, who send them to foreign
markets.  They are all caught with long lines; the hooks
are baited with pieces of smaller fishes.  The utmost quan-

to 30 tons.  They are most in season in spring.  Herrings
are caught in Loch Stornoway, some years in great abun-

port, from 20 to 80 tons burden each, which are employed
in the summer season in the herring bounty-fishing, and at
other times in the coasting trade.  They are manned with
natives of the island, and are always victualled, except as
to the article of beef only, in the country.-Common sea-
weed is always used for manure.  A few tons of kelp are
manufactured every third year in the parish.-The prin-
cipal Bays are,-Broad Bay, South Bay, Loch Storno-
way, and Loch Grimshader; the last is a safe harbour
for small vessels; the first but an indifferent one.  In
South Bay vessels sometimes stop for a tide, but it is no
harbour.  Loch Stornoway is a famous harbour for ships
of any burden; the ground is good, and no weighty sea can
