<FOOTNOTE>

*This mason is also a farmer, but mason work is likewise performed
reasonably by the cooper and the plough makers, who are very useful and
expert at various other hadicraft employments.

+There are all married, and are either hired by the day or the year, at
the lime quarries, etc.  The wages of tradesmen and labourers, are the
same as in the neighbouring parishes; and the prices of provisions are re-
gulated by the markets of Ayr and Kilmarnock.

+The total produce of oats per annum is about 4500 bolls.  These bolls
measure 8 Winchester bushels each.  Of these oats 2125 bolls were milled
last year in the parish.
