  In 1836, the total number of persons of all ages belonging to
the agricultural class was 359 ; to other classes, 1135.
  In 1831, in the return made to Government, of the male popu-
lation upwards of twenty years of age, there were, agricultural oc-
cupiers of the first class, 15; do. of the second class, 5 ; agricul-
tural labourers, 54 ; manufacturers or weavers, 63 ; retail trade
and handicraft, 81 ; wholesale, capitalists, clergy, and professional,
7; labourers not agricultural, 44 ; all other males upwards of twenty
years, 28; male servants upwards of twenty years, 3 ; female ser-
vants of all ages, 35. In 1831, of the males above twenty years of
age employed in retail trade and handicraft occupations there were,
carriers and carters 7, sLaters 7, bakers 6, carpenters 6, sawyers 6,
shoemakers 6, cabinet-makers 5, publicans 5, tailors 5, black-
smiths 4, masons 3, wheelwrights 3, grocers 3, butchers 2, millers
2, plasterers 2, house-painter 1, clock and watchmaker 1, drysalt-
er 1, earthenware 1, cattle-doctor 1, maltster 1, shopkeeper 1,
flax-dresser 1, wood-merchant 1. The number of persons thus
classified in the return to Government in 1831 is much the same
now. A few of the weavers are employed in the damask manu-
facture, for which Dunfermline has long been celebrated; but most-
of them keep by the cotton manufacture for the Glasgow market.
This last has long been a poor trade; but being easily learned,
and the workman being his own master, it is generally preferred,
The tambouring and sewing of muslin give employment to a con-
siderable number of females. But there is not that briskness in
any of these departments which would indicate a flourishing state
of trade. The extensive salt and coal works, which at one time
contributed to the industry of the parish, were given up in the
latter part of the last century. One colliery only now remains,
in which about thirty pickmen, and thirty labourers and others,
are employed. During the last six years, the working has been
confined to a seam of 3 feet, containing in some places 1 1/2 feet of
parrot coal of very fine quality, suitable for gas-works. The an-
nual produce may be stated at 2500 tons of parrot coal, and
6000 tons of rough or splint coal, in all 8500 tons, of which two-
