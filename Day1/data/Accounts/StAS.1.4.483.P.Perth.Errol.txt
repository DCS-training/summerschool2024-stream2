pense of the farmer, it is perpetually encroaching on the
grounds belonging to the other kinds of grain.  Some te-
nants who are only bringing their lands into order, or
who, it is feared, are bound down by their leases, adhere
strictly to the sixths into which they have divided them,
and convert no more into wheat than they had under fal-
low; others, whose possession have been longer in a state
of improvement, borrow considerably from the barley and
oats, turning fields of peas and of grass into wheat as they
judge best; while some very good farmers plough up the
whole of what was grass, and lay the third of  their grounds
under wheat. But this extensive cropping is liable to be
interrupted, and is sometimes entirely prevented, except
on the fallow, by the heavy rains which fall in autumn.
   The feed-time is finished in general by the middle of Oc-
tober, and the harvest commences about the 24th of Au-
gust.  According to the soil, strong beans, grey peas and
beans, or early peas are raised; the grain is sown as early
in March as the season will permit, the oats immediately
after; and the harvest takes place in September.  The
land for the barley, that it may be fully pulverized, is tho-
roughly ploughed at 3 different periods, November, A-
pril and May, and the crop is ready for reaping at the 
same time with the oats.  Drilled beans, potatoes and tur-
nip, are sometimes put in place of peas, and found to be an
excellent preparation for the barley.-If the quantity
reaped from each kind of grain in the parish should not
seem remarkable, the quality yields an abundant com-
pensation.  The return obtained in general from wheat 
may be 10 bolls the acre on the fallow, and 8 after grass.
The average produce of peas and beans is 8 bolls, which,
at the price they usually bring, is a poor crop; but the
benefit derived to the land, and the maintenance they
