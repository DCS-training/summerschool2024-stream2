"Castellum turris fortalicium de Caprington." It originally be-
longed to, a branch of.the Wallace family. It stands in a low si-
tuation, on the very banks of the Irvine; yet at the same time it
is considerably elevated above the grounds. immediately surround-
ing it, being built upon a fine basalt rock, curiously jutting out of
the vale below. It is a very massy building, in the old baronial
style, with a lofty tower in the centre, over the main entrance, and
which, latter is protected by a spacious archway and towers, giving
to the whole a very noble and commanding appearance. Consi-
dering the immense size of the castle, and the good condition of
the grounds, it may very fairly he considered the first residence in
the parish.
	About a mile south of Caprington, is situated Treesbank, the
beautiful residence of G. J. Campbell, Esq, representative and
direct lineal  descendant of the once distinguished family of the
Campbells of Cessnock. The house is plain externally, but a
large and handsome addition having just been made to it, it is now
very comfortable and commodious. The grounds and the view
from them are very beautiful.
       The other residences are Shawhill, a modern and very neat
building, Dollars, Bellfield, and Milrig, which last is rebuilding
in an elegant style.
