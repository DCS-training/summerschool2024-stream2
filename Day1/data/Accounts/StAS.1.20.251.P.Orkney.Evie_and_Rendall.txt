haps double the number necessary, owing principally to cus-
tom and the smallness of the farms; very few of them are 
bred in these parishes, but are bought when year-olds from
dealers, who bring them over from Caithness and Suther-
land, and are fold again to the same dealers, from four years 
old and upwards, very few of them dying in the parish.
There are about 1300 black-cattle, principally cows and 
queys, all reared in the parish; the greater part of which are 
sold out of it at different ages, very few of them being con-
sumed by the inhabitants.  The prices of them are almost
doubled within these few years, being now, in 1797, from 
two to four guineas a-head.  Few or no oxen are used or 
reared.  The number of sheep may be about 2000, though, 
as they all run wild, without any herd, it is impossible to 
ascertain their number with any precision; very few sheep 
are fold, being either consumed by the owners, or allowed 
to die of old age, or perish for want of care.  No care 
whatever is taken of meliorating the breed of them, or of 
the black-cattle.  The number of swine may be about 400
or 500, of a very diminutive species.  They are sold, when 
full grown, from 4 s. to 8 s.  They go at large from the 
end of harvest till the month of May, and being never 
ringed, and getting no food from their owners, do incre-
dible mischief with their snouts both to corn and grass 
grounds.  Every family rears a number of geese and other 
poultry.

   Servants Wages.-The wages of a capable man-servant
are from L. 3 to L. 4, 10s. Sterling per annum; of a wo-
man 20 s. to 30 s.  All servants are maintained in the fa-
mily.  Men-servants are rendered scarce by considerable 
drains to the navy, the Greenland and herring fisheries,
but above all to Hudfon's Bay.  The making of kelp, alfo,
takes up a good many hands in the summer months.-
