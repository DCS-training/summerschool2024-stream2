   Minerals.-On the farm of Monedie, next the river, there
is a pure, unmixed, strong gravel, 2 feet below the surface;
which the present incumbent discovered, by digging a well.
About 12 feet deep, there was a stratum of a perfectly black
colour, and about a foot thick, so extremely hard to dig, that
the workman, gave it up, declaring  that he would be a loser at
triple or quadruple the price agreed on.  When it was bro-
ken through, the pieces were full of shining yellow particles,
like spangles of gold; but after some hours exposure to the
open air, they lost their lustre.  It appeared, in some places,
as if it had been a little fused by the force of fire.  The co-
lour of the gravel, above and below, and in immediate con-
tact with it, was not in the least altered.  The black gravel,
from its surface quite through, was of the same deep black
colour, and when it was broken into small pieces, these gold
like spangles still appeared.  Mineralogists may, possibly, if
they have seen or heard of this phenomenon, account for it.
The water of the well is exceeding fine and soft, and very
good for washing and breaking soap, owing, no doubt, to its
being filtered through such a dept of rough gravel.
