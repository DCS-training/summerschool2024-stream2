     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF LOGIERAIT.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.)

     By the Rev. Dr THOMAS BISSET.

     Situation, etc.

   THIS parish is situated in the shire of Perth, in the
presbytery of Dunkeld, and in the Synod of Perth
and Stirling.  Its eastern extremity is about half a mile
below the junction of the rivers Tummel and Tay.  The
principal part of the parish is of an irregular triangular
shape, lying either between these two rivers, or on the
north side of the Tummel.  The tract extending along the
Tay, is denominated Strath-Tay.  South of Tummel, is
Slesbeg, or the narrow country.  These two districts are
separated by a ridge, which is terminated on the east end
by precipitous rocks, and is intersected at five or six miles
distance from these rocks, by another chain crossing it ob-
liquely, from south-west to north-east.  The distance be-
tween Tay and Tummel, may be about seven miles.  One
detached part of this parish stretches about a mile south of
Tay, upon the road to Taymounth.  Another division of it is
situated in Rannoch, at thirty miles distance.
