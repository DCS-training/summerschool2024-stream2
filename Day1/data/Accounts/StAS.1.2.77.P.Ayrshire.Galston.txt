   Woods and Planting.-There is a great deal of fine old plant-
ing, many very large Scotts firs, and some copse wood round the
house of Cessnock.  Within these 20 years, very extensive
plantations have been raised by Mr Brown of Water-haughs,
and other proprietors in the parish.  Near Old Barr castle, there
is a very remarkable old ehn, which measures 24 feet round, has
12 feet of trunk at the top, and spreads itself into 24 branches,
many of which, are themselves large trees.  A tree called the
Maiden-Oak, was lately sold for about L. 13.  By the oldest
leases on the Barr estate, the tenants were bound to plant, at
least twelve ash yearly.  This accounts for the beautiful ap-

general surrounded by trees.

   Fowls and Birds.-There are here all the common tame
fowls of the country.  The muirs yield plenty of grouse, and
partridges abound in the low grounds.  Within these 13 or 14
years, some wood-larks have been seen in the plantations of
Cessriock; and about the same time bull-finches first appeared;
and have now increased to a very considerable number.  They
do great damage to the blossoms of the plumbs, and small
fruit; a loss which is scarcely compensated by their destroying,
at the same time, some grubs and caterpillar, and filling
the nieghbouring woods with the musie of their pipes.  Wood-
cocks, in the winter and spring are to be found in great num-
bers; and within 5 or 6 years, pheasints have bred in the pa-
rish, but have been, in a great measure, destroyed by poachers.

   Minerals.-Miss Scot has a valuable coal, now working,
within a quarter of a mile of the village; and also an exceed-
ing good lime quarry, which sufficiently serves all the tenants
on this part of her extensive domains.-It is worthy of re-
mark, that within these 40 or 50 years, all the fuel made use of
