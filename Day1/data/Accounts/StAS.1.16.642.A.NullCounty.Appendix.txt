APPENDIX to the STATISTICAL ACCOUNT
of the Parish of INVERESK.

BY desire of the patron of the parish, a meeting of
heritors was held in November 1794, to consult
about repairing or rebuilding the church, when an enquiry
was directed to be made respecting the number of persons,
who could be accommodated with seats in the present
church, and the number who might be expected to require
seats, if there was a church built of sufficient dimensions.
The result was as follows:
