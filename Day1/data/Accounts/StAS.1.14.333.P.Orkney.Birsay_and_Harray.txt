     Of Birsay and Harray.

by Nicol Spence, some time church agent, and partly
by a small gratuity given by the Society for Propaga-
ting Christian Knowledge; the salary is 10 L. with small
perquisites; and the number of scholars, mostly attend-
ing in winter, are about 40.  We have no inns in Har-
ray.  There is a good deal of malt brewed in different
houses, where sometimes a battle will happen, which
often brings forth a petty law-suit of little consequence.
No cottagers are employed except in harvest, and but
few hired servants, most of the labour being done by
the children of the house, except in cases of minority.

   The number of souls at present is 663, as may be
seen by the following abstract:
