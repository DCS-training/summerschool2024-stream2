measure fallen away.  A home missionary society for the town and
suburbs was established in 1830. The expenditure during the
xe`r ending March 1832 was L. 43, 10s. 6d., leaving a balance
against the society of L. 5, 13s. 4d.
	Deputations from most of the leading religious institutions in
the united kingdom visit Arbroath in the course of the season.  A
few years ago, when it was presumed that a Catholic spirit pervaded
the several bodies of Dissenters, the collections, made up chiefly
of what was given by members of the Established church, were in
general liberal. But they have fallen much off since the Dissen-
ters began to exhibit a spirit of sectarian virulence against the Es-
tablishment. In the parish church and chapel of ease, collections
have been made from time to time in aid of the Scottish Mission-
ary, the Bible and the Gaelic school societies, as well as the Ge-
neral Assembly's schools, and the General Assembly's mission to
India.  No record, apparently, has been kept of these collections
so that the amount cannot be exhibited. On the whole, however,
the total amount subscribed and collected annually in the parish
for religious purposes may be stated at about L. 130 or L. 140.
	Education.--lllustrative of the state of education, the following
table exhibits the number of persons residing in the parish, who
were returned in the census of 1831 as being then at school.
