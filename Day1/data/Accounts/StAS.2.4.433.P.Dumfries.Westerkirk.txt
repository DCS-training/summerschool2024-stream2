suring from 36 to 50 yards in diameter. These are supposed
by some antiquaries to be remains of Pictish encampments; while
others are of opinion that they were merely place of strength into
which the people collected their cattle at night for security from
the English borderers. There is also a third conjecture, that they
were for the purpose of protecting the cattle during the night from
the ravages of the wild beasts, when the country was covered with
wood. This last supposition is perhaps the most correct. On the
farm of Enzieholm, there are vestiges of an old fortification of a
triangular form. It has the appearance of a place of great anti-
quity, and of considerable strength. No conjecture at this dis-
tance of time can be formed, either as to the time when it was
built, or by whom it was possessed. There are remains of an old
castle at Glendinning, and of another at Westerhall.

	There is one blind person in the parish, and five fatuous; but
none of them receive aid from the parochial funds.
	Character of the People.--The tenantry of this parish bear an ex-
cellent character for integrity and honour. As farmers, they are skil-
ful and industrious, and spare no expense either in the improvement
of their stock or of their farms. The lower classes are sober and in-
telligent. The generality of them are fond of reading; and, as they
have an ample supply of books, the shepherds in particular have ac-
quired a degree of knowledge and information beyond what might
have been expected from their situation in life. In their dress they have
nothing peculiar; the black and white plaid worn round the shoul-
ders is universally used. No class of people are more contented with
their situation. Indeed, the superior comfort of the lower classes
in this parish, and in all the extensive pastoral and agricultural dis-
tricts of the numerous parishes of which the Duke of Buccleuch
is the sole or principal proprietor, obviously arises from the wise
