     NUMBER IV.

     PARISH OF LADYKIRK.

     (County of Berwick-Presbytery of Chirnside-Synod of Mers
     and Tiviotdale.)

     By the Rev. MR. THOMAS MILL.

     Name, Situation, Extent, and Soil.
        
   THE ancient name of this parish was Upsettingtown,
which James IV. changed to Ladykirk, after having
built a handsome church in it, which he dedicated to the Vir-
gin Mary.  It was within this church, that the supplemental
treaty, to that of Chateau Cambresis, was concluded between
the English and Scots Commissioners, and the duplicates were
exchanged the same day at Norham.  On Holywell haugh,
opposite to Norham Castle, Edward I. and several of the
Scottish nobility met, to settle the dispute betwixt Bruce and
Baliol, relative to the succession to the Crown of Scotland.
This parish lies along the banks of the Tweed, is 2 miles
long and one broad, and contains about 3500 English statute
acres.  The country is flat, and interspersed with a few rising
grounds.  The soil in general is very good, and conflicts of a
deep loam. in some places gravelly, and in others on a clay
bottom.  It is all capable of bearing good crops, with judici-
ous cultivation:  some of the outfields were formerly infected
with whins and some heath, both of which have long ago been
totally eradicated.
