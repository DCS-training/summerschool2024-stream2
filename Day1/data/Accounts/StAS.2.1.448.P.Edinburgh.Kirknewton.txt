in the whole parochial establishment. A new manse was erected
in the immediate vicinity of the church, with glebe, &c. attached.
A few years ago, the manse having, become very insufficient in
different respects, the heritors, of their own accord, resolved to
subject it to a thorough repair, and, at the same time, to make
an addition to the amount, and still more to the quality of its ac-
commodations; and this has been done in a manner highly cre-
ditable to their taste and liberality. The internal arrangements
are in commodious accordance with the style of modern improve-
ment and convenience, and, in external appearance, it is now a
very handsome structure, no wise unworthy of the conspicuous and
commanding situation which it occupies. The site, it is under-
stood, was selected, among other considerations, for the sake of
the view, and the choice in this respect has been eminently suc-
cessful. Rarely is there to be met with any thing finer or richer
in all the constituents of landscape beauty than the surrounding
prospect. The stretch of country which it embraces is of wide
extent, with a surface broken and varied into the most pleasing
and striking forms of picturesque scenery, and wearing throughout
an aspect of smiling fertility and cultivation. In this general ap-
pearance there are some features which stand out in more distin-
guished prominence. Among these the eye will not fail to mark
the stately baronial mansion of Hatton, old and gray, looking out
from among the still noble remains of its magnificent park
trees, telling of princely state and wide domain passed away;
the deep masses of the Dalmaboy woods; the First of Forth,
now hid, now seen, amid the openings to the left and, on the
right, the twin hills of Dalmaboy and Kames, towering singly in
front of the finely diversified range of the Pentlands; and the
whole closed in and terminated by the far-famed capital of Scot-
land, with all the peculiar characteristics of the "romantic town"
spread out in full and clear display.
   The glebe contains about eight acres. The stipend is 192
bolls 3 lippies, half meal half barley, and L. 102, 6s, 1 7/12d. in
money.
