tures, who, from local circumstances, are secluded from the more cul-
tivated part of society, unquestionably reflects a high degree of honour on
the worthy person by whom it is so generously bestowed, and shall in-
tallibly prove a source of unspeakable consolation.  The memory of the
naughty, and, of course, the cruel-hearted daughters of dissipation, shall
be utterly forgotten, or if mentioned, shall be mentioned with abhorrence:
which that of the generous, whose kind efforts are well directed for the
permanent good of mankind, shall be blessed on the earth for many suc-
ceeding ages.
