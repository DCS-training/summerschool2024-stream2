that it was fatal to more than 50 people.  The proportion of
burials, of males to those of females, is nearly as 110 to 125;
whereas the proportion of births, of males to those of females,
taken from the record of baptisms, by a medium of averages
for 5 years, at different periods, is nearly as 145 to 128.
The average number of children, dying under 2, is 236:
from 2 to 5, 98; and of still-born children 50.  The most fatal
period to people advanced in life, is from 60 to 70, where
the annual average of deaths is 57; and to young people
past childhood, from 15 to 25, when the same average is
47.  The most fatal months are January, March, and De-
cember, the averages of burials in these being respectively 88,
73, 74.  But, perhaps the most important fact in the whole
register, and which ought to excite attention from the persons
most averse to the practice of inoculation, is, that, while in
1787 and 1789, the average number of children dying under
5, was only 171, a similar average for the years 1788 and
1790, in which the small pox raged, arose to the astonishing
sum of 420.  The whole number of people reported as dying
above 90, in all the 5 years of the register, is 25; of whom one
was in the 99th year; another above the 100th, another in the
102d, and another probably in the 107th year of their seve-
ral lives.  The name of the last was James Peter, who died
in 1790.  A corresponding date of his father and mother's
marriage, was certainly found in the parish register of Dun-
nichen.  Their marriage was laid to have subtitled only 1 year,
and he affirmed, that he was their only child.
   Since the enumeration in 1788, the town continues to in-
crease with greater rapidity than before; and the whole in-
habitants of the town and parish can hardly be estimated at
less than 24,000; they are certainly rated sufficiently low at
23,000.  They reside chiefly in the town and suburbs; and,
as the inhabitants, of what may be properly called the coun-
