in Zetland, though conducted by estimable, zealous and right-
minded men, the mere attainment of reading and writing, combined
with the almost mechanical reading of the Scriptures, form the
staple of the education; and but too little attention is paid to the
moral and intellectual part of education. The Sunday schools,
wherever established, have been productive of very great and pal-
pable good effects.
  The yearly amount of the parochial teacher's salary is L.34,
4s. 8 1/2d; his fees amount to about L.30 per annum.
  Savings Banks.-There is one of these banks established in the
parish. But the succession of bad crops and fishings has almost
entirely stopped the deposits, for some time.
  In 1838 the sums withdrawn amounted to L.45 ; in 1839 to
L.16, 8s.; and in 1840 to L.13, 9s.
  Poor and Poor's Funds.-The number of persons receiving pa-
rochial aid is 105. The average sum allotted to each is 1s. 8d.
per month. The average annual amount of contributions for their
relief, is L.116. This sum is taken from the receipts for the
year commencing Ist December 1839, and ending Ist December
1840, and may be deemed a fair average - the collection not
having much varied, for several years. Of the above amount there
was derived from church collections, L.74, Os. 2 1/2d.; allowed by
heritors to make up deficiency, L.22; from two donations, L.6,
5s.; mortcloth hire, L.2, 12s. 6d.; collection at sermons by mi-
nister of parish on St John's day, at request of masons of Morton
Lodge, L.12, 1s.; total, L.116, 18s. 8 1/2d.

  May 1841.
