   Farmers.-The farmers in this district are in general a so-
ber, virtuous, and respectable class of men: they are equally
free from the licentiousness of the proud and wealthy, and
from the growling and discontented temper of the less sober
and less industrious poor.  It must be acknowledged, how-
ever, that they do not in general much excel their neighbours
in the art of farming: like the tenants of most of the for-
feited estates in Scotland, they are perhaps rather indolent,
because they are independent; and they make but few
spirited exertions, because their rents are small and their
leases long.  Perhaps the principal cause why they are be-
hind in some improvements, is, that their farms are in gene-
ral very injudiciously laid out.  They consist of a long nar-
row strip, beginning in the valley and rising to the summit of
the hill; sometimes one, two, or three miles long, and not a
quarter of a mile broad.  At the time when the leases were
granted, that is, about the beginning of this century, this
might be attended with many conveniences.  The great ob-
ject at that time for every farmer, was to have every thing he
needed within his own farm: and by this division, he had his
proportion of moss, and meadow, pasture, and arable ground.
Whereas, had the farms been regularly laid out, this could
not have been the case.  This, however, is now a great bar to
improvement.  For the rich low grounds in the valley and its
vicinity, by being intersected, and every farm by being inter-
mixed with another in this irregular manner, cannot be inclosed
to advantage; of course, cannot be improved, from circum-
stances which are rather the misfortune than the fault of the
tenants.  For unless a general excambion were taking place,
and every farm were new modelled, which is next to impossi-
