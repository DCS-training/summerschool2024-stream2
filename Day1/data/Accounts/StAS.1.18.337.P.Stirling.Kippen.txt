   Remarkable Medical Case.-It may not be improper in this
place to mention the remarkable case of a boy who lost: a
considerable portion of brain, and yet recovered, without
detriment to any faculty mental or corporeal.  On the 1st of
July 1792, William Stewart, a servant boy, about 14 years
of age, was by a blow from the foot of a horse knocked to the
ground, and left in a state of insensibility.  From a large.
wound on the right side of his sore head, blood issued its con-
siderable quantities, as well as at different times, a considera-

survived the accident, but recovered, and was seen perfectly
well, by the writer of this account in the month of November
following.  A distinct account of this case, and of the whole
process of the cure, was published by Mr Robert Leny, a
young gentleman, practitioner in physic, which deserves the
attention of those who are curious in physiology.  It is inserted
in the Medical Commentaries, published by Dr Duncan of
Edinburgh, for 1793, p. 301.

   Church, Manse, etc.-The church is said to have been
built or rebuilt in 1691.  The easter part of it was rebuilt in
1737.  It was completely repaired in 1779, and is now a very
decent and commodious place of worship-William Leckie
of Dasher made a present of a very good bell to the parish.-
The present manse was built in 1706.  The stipend by the
last decreet of augmentation in 1763 is nearly 89 bolls of
meal, together with L. 34: 3: 4 ster. which sum includes the
