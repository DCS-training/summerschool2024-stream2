any expence to the fund.  To their discretion also, is left
the apportioning each poor person's supply, and they keep re-
gular books for the inspection of the heritors.  By this ma-

   Heritors.-The superiority of this parish is vested in his
Grace the Duke of Montrose and Sir Archibald Edmonstone
Baronet of Duntreath; whose ancestors, at one time, also
possessed the whole property of it.  In the beginning of last
century, that part of it which belonged to the estates of Mon-

park adjoining, being alone retained in the family.  The
estate of Duntreath, formerly one of the greater baronies, in
right whereof the proprietors sat in Parliament without elec-

William Edmonstone, Baronet of Duntreath, and Mary
Countess of Angus, daughter of Robert III. and sister to
James I.  This Princess lies buried in Strathblane church.
The present Sir Archibald is lineally descended from both
alliances.
   There are 9 other heritors, who possess property in the
parish, from L. 100 to L. 250 each; besides 15 of smaller

rental of the parish, amounts to L. 2500.

been lathed or plaistered, the bare walls and roof without
