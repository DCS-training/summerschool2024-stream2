which probably in former times was a place for distributing
justice during the feudal government.

   Old Castles.-There are two old castles in the parish.
1st, Old Craig or Raven's Craig, formerly, and for a long
time, the seat of a branch of the Marischal family.  It
stands on the south side of the Ugie, in the north-west part
of this parish.  At a very distant period, it has been a
place of very great strength, and, before the introduction
of gun-powder, could have resisted any attack.  There are
evident marks of the river having been carried round the
house.  The walls are very thick, and fortified round.
Though daily mouldering, the greatest part still remains.
Foxes lodge below the ruins, and ravens hatch their young
on the top of the walls.  Two finer ruins are scarce to be
seen than the Raven's Craig in this parish, and Inverugie
in the parish of St Fergus, on the opposite side of the river,
about half a mile's distance.  The estate and parish of St
Fergus first belonged to the Cheynes, but the two castles
by intermarriages became the property of the Marischal
family*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*As the noble family of Marischal had, for many centuries, in their
possession the parishes of Peterhead and St Fergus, some account may be
expected of them.
   Cambden and Boethius say, that the family of Keith derive their origin
from the Celti, a people bordering on the Saltus Hireinus, who gave the
first check to the conquests of the Romans in the time of Augustus C‘sar,
but being routed in the reign of his successor Tiberius, part of them set-
tled under their leader Battus, at the mouth of the Rhine, and from his
name the country was called Battavia.  In the reign of Corbridus II.
surnamed Goldus, King of Scotland, the Batavian Celti sent a colony to
seek habitations in Britain, and some of them, whom Fordune calls Celti
Meliboi, were driven upon the northern coasts of Scotland, and settled in
that part now called Caithness.
