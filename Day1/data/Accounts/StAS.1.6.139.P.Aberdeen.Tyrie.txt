will beautify the country, be of great value to the proprietors,
and afford wood for building and husbandry.
   Fevers and rheumatism are the most prevalent distempers,
and are most common after wet harvests, when the corns
are not got in in good condition.  The latter is much attri-
buted to the disuse of wearing flannel next the skin, and to the
too great use of potatoes.
   There are several excellent mineral springs, which are of
considerable service in weaknesses of the stomach, when not
drunk in too large quantities; and the Mourning Well, in
the den of Boyndlie, is such a copious spring, as perhaps can-
not be equalled in all the county.  The water of Tyrie runs a-
long the north end of the parish, over which a good stone
bridge is built.-The Goner, another considerable, and,
in many places, a beautiful, smooth-slowing rivulet, runs al-
most through the middle of the parifh; over which an excel-
lent stone bridge has lately been built at Tillenamolt, at the
expence of Sir William Forbes the proprietor.-Here al-
so, there is one of the most considerable, and best furnished
water-mills in Buchan: and a fine road lately made through a
deep and extensive moss, shews what a public-spirited land-
lord can do, for promoting the industry, prosperity, and hap-
piness of the country.  Both these rivulets produce very deli-
cious trouts; and some, in the latter, are 13 inches long.
-Though their numbers be now greatly diminished by the
use of lime as a manure, and the steeping of flax in the adjoin-

   The soil, when not in the vicinity of moss, is for the most
part, of a fertile reddish colour, pretty deep in the vallies, but
shallower as the ground rises to an eminence; and many hun-
dred acres of ground, very capable of improvement, are still
in their natural uncultivated state.-The air is open, and
wholesome; unless in places that are low and marshy, or near
