     Extent, Surface, Soil, etc.

   The parish extends from north to south, about ten miles;
and from east to west, between five and six; not exceeding
the distance of four miles from the most fertile and improv-
ed part of Strathmore.  It may be divided into two dis-
tricts, the northern and the southern.  The northern, or
the upper part, consisting chiefly of hills and vallies; the
former, of no considerable height, produces, in its present
state, better crops of grass than corn, on account chiefly of
the distance from manure.  But that the land is by no
means of an inferior quality clearly appears from the exer-
tions of some individuals, and particularly of one tenant,
who, happening to be in better circumstances than ordinary,
by which he has been enabled to do justice to his ground,
has had, for some years past, such returns, as may vie with
the productions of some of the most fertile, and best im-
proved soil in Strathmore.  In the lower district, extend-
ing from the southern extremity, about three miles north,
the ground is, in general, very fertile, and produces excel-
lent crops of oats, barley and turnip, being advantageously
situated within four miles of marle, a very useful manure in
this country.  This part of the parish has a fine exposure,
lies in the form of an oblong, gently declining to the south.

   Rivers-The river Isla bounds the parish on the west.
This beautiful stream, after running through Glenilla, the
neighbouring parish to the north, falls, upon touching this
parish, into a deep rocky channel; and after five miles of
a circular course, it leaves the parish at the castle of Airly, a
romantic seat of the Earl of Airly, and runs nearly in a
south direction, down to the fertile fields of Strathmore.  It
