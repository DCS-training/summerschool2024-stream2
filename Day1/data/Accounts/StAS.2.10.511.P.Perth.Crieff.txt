  Fisheries.-The fisheries are never let, though the principal
heritors have the right of catching fish with arks, nets, gullets, cruives,
and other instruments secured to them by their charters.  Nets
are still sometimes employed on the lochs by the proprietors; and
cruives are also in existence on the Earn, in the neighbouring pa-
rishes of Muthill and Trinit Gask.  But, with the exception of
set lines, the rod is the only implemet, that is used in this
parish for the rivers; and the public are permitted to use it, during
the proper season, as often as they are disposed to avail tbeln-
selves of the privilege.
  Raw Produce, &c.-It would be extremely difficult to arrive at
any thing like a correct estimate of the average gross amount of
raw produce raised in the parish.  An approximation might be
made to the value of what is raised in the different farms; but the
acres, pecks, and garden, are so numerous and so varied in their
productions, that the labour necessary to form a tolerably accurate
guess of what they may be likely to produce, would not be war-
ranted by any practical good that could arise from a knowledge of
the result.  Suffice it to say that, with the exception of a few
farms, the soil is nnt adapted for wheat; but it produces excellent
oats and barley, and it is particularly adapted for green crops,
especially potatoes and turnips.  The potatoes which are raised
here may compare with those which are produced in any of the
neighbouring counties.  The great demand that has of l`te years
been made for them in the London nmrket has given a stimulus
their production; and the growing crops are often sold at from
L. 12 to L. 15 the acre.
