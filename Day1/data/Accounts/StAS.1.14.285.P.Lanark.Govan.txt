     Of Govan.

   Agriculture.-There is perhaps no parish in the W. of
Scotland, where agriculture is better understood, or has
been carried, within these 40 years, to greater per-
fection than in Govan.  The soil is various, but by no
means naturally fertile.  That nearest to the river is
mostly a light loam.  In the higher grounds, and to-
wards the foot of the rise, the tendency is generally more
or less to clay and till; and the middle of that part of
the plain, which lies on the S. side of the river, though
a considerable proportion of it be now highly improved,
appears to have consisted originally of a barren sand,
covered with heath.  In the S. and S. W. parts of this
parish, besides what has been lately made to yield very
rich crops, or is planted with Scotch fir, there is still
more than 100 acres of moss, upon which the husbandman
is seldom to be seen, but in the season for the casting of
peats; and of these, the quantity that is yearly prepa-
red, is very inconsiderable; because, being of a quality
greatly inferior to those brought into Glasgow from
other quarters, there is no demand for them in that mar-
ket; and they are used by the inhabitants of the S. di-
vision of the parish only for kindling their fires.
   The lands of Govan are generally well enclosed and
divided; and a considerable proportion of those on the
S. side of the river is farmed by the proprietors them-
selves.  With the industry and activity of the farmers,
which are nowhere more conspicuous, several other cir-
cumstances have evidently concurred, in bringing this

of money has, no doubt, during that time, been greatly diminished, and coal
was formerly wrought nearer to the village than at present; but whether either,
or both of these circumstances, along with the additional depth of the coal,
will sufficiently account for the extraordinary rise of the price of fuel in this
parish, shall be left to others to determine.
