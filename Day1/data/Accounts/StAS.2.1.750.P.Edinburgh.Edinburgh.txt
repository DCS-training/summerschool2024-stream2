tee. 6. Law Committee. The managers have a clerk to issue
notices for convening meetings, and writing minutes of their pro-
ceedings.
   In 1833 a question occurred respecting the new burying grounds
acquired by the kirk-session, who, to avoid legal proceedings, pro-
posed, on certain conditions, an amicable arrangement. The he-
ritors, however, raised an action, which terminated in a joint mi-
nute of compromise and settlement, to which the Court of Session
interposed their authority on 5th July 1844, leaving matters much
in the same way as they formerly were, after expending about
L. 1500 in litigation.
   In September 1844 the managers appointed an inspector of
the poor, and since then, also, an assistant-inspector,-an efficient
staff of such officers being found necessary for making the requi-
site investigations of the grounds of the claims of pauper applicants,
and for efficiently superintending the out-door poor.
The paid officers of the establishment are,

   Post Office.-The first regular post between London and Edin-
burgh was established in 1635. It was dispatched from both
places respectively once or twice a-week; and the stated time for
the journey was three days. The sum charged for a single letter
from London was 8d., and from intermediate distances 6d., 4d.,
and 2d., the last including all places under eighty miles distance.
   In 1649 the post office was taken under the management of the
Government, and, some years afterwards, farmed out to a Post-
Master-General. The rates were somewhat lowered, and the
post towns increased.
   In 1710 a new act amended the post office establishment; and
