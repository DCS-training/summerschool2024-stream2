   There are two extensive corn-mills, and one woollen manufac-
tory on the North Esk. One of these mills goes under the name
of the Iron mill. It was formerly used for manufacturing iron
bars, sheet iron, and all sorts of heavy smith work,-the ham-
mers being raised by water power. The work was carried on for
many years by Mr James Gray,* grandson of Mr Thomas Gray,
surgeon, Dalkeith. It was continued by Mr David Hutchison, his
nephew, till from various causes the trade began to decline. The
mill was then converted into a corn-mill, and the business was af-
terwards carried on by his son Mr David Hutchison, who died in
1830. Mr James Gray was distinguished for his mechanical ta-
lents, and his zeal for astronomical science. Vestiges of his ac-
tive genius still remain in the locality where he resided. No
fewer than eight dials are placed in different parts of the premises.
And a large horizontal one stands in the centre of the garden, of
three feet and a half diameter, made of sandstone, and of fine
workmanship. His name is inscribed upon it; but there is no
date. The lines are now b becoming faint, and would require to be
renewed. There are also two pillars that formed the stand of a
large telescope of his own construction, and on a stone placed be-
tween them is carved out the latitude of the place. It is stated
as being 55\d 52' 62". The latitude marked on the dial in the
Duke of Buccleuch's grounds is 55\d 53'. The latitude of Dal-
keith town may be regarded as very nearly expressed by either of
these quantities. The longitude is 3\d 4' 30" west; and the High,
Street is 182 feet above the level of the sea.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>

   The earliest account of the population of Dalkeith, so far as we
know, is that furnished to Dr Webster in 1755. The following
table will exhibit the amount of population at the periods men-
tioned.

Dr Webster, in 1755, gives                         3110
Statistical Account of 1791,                       4366+  +1256

   The following very accurate census of the parish was made in
September 1839, expressly for this Statistical Account.

<FOOTNOTE>He died in 1761.
    We are much inclined to suspect that this number is above the truth.
