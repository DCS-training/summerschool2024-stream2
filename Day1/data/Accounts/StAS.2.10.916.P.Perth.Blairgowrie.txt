			      III.--POPULATION.

  The population of the parish in 1792 appears to have been
1651, of which 1226 were in the landward part of the parish, and
425 in the village. It is thought that, for perhaps two centuries
preceding the period to which this report applies, and down to
about the year 1812 or 1814, the population continued nearly
stationary, or, at all events, that the increase was very small, if any.
   On comparing the return by Dr Webster in 1755 with that fur-
nished in the last Statistical Account, we find that, in the inter-
vening period of nearly forty years, the increase over the whole
parish was only 55.
   The following table shows the state of the population of the
country part of the parish at different periods betwixt 1792 and
1836, and the comparative increase or decrease at each period:

                                       Total decrease,              4

   The disproportioned increase in the latter part of this period is
chiefly owing to the number of families who have of late years
taken up their residence in the neighbourhood of the various
spinning-mills adjoining the town. The writer is at a loss to ac-
count for the large decrease which seems to have taken place among
the rural population between 1793 and 1811, unless on the as-
sumption, that there must have been some mistake or inaccuracy
in the return for the former year.
   The state of the population in 1841, and the respective pro-
portions residing in the town and country, is as follows:

donians to have occupied the ridge or elevated ground extending from the Ericht
to Forneth, about five miles to thd westward, having their left covered by the
precipitous banks of the Ericht, and their right by a deep ravine to the westward of
Forneth; and he advances a very ingenious hypothesis as to the mode of attack, the
various movements of the two hostile armies during the battle, and the fatal error
committed by the Caledonians, of descending from their vantage ground, and expos-
ing themselves to the impetuous attacks of the Romans on the plain. Without
venturing any opinion on this subject, it is sufficient to refer the reader who may
feel any interest in this much disputed question, to Mr Knox's work. The na-
ture of the ground, as well as the numerous remains of Roman encampments and
ramparts which are still to be seen in the neigbbouring parishes, certainly favour the
hypothesis alluded to.
