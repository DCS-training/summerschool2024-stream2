                                     Total,       197         239           77

                                    Average,       28          34           11
            The number of families in the parish in 1831,                                      379
                                     chiefly employed in agriculture,                          190

               But the number of marriages in the above account can alone be
            regarded as accurately ascertained. Many of the births in the pa-
            rish are not registered, especially of those who belong to the Seces-
            sion.  So that there are probably about six births annually more
            than appear by the above statement.  The register of deaths is stil
            farther from the truth, being a record only of those who are buried
            in the parish.  Many people, especially in the parish of Nairn,
            have their burying-grounds in Auldearn; while, on the other hand,
            many who die in this parish are buried in others.
               There is no proprietor, or family of independent fortune at pre-
            sent residing in the parish, except James C. Brodie, Esq. of Le-
            then, and family.
               The number of families is 371; the number of persons in each,
            on an average, 4 ; the number of inhabited houses, 371; of unin-
            habited or building, 9. The parish contains 4 insane persons.
               A considerable proportion of the people are decidedly religious,
            and their influence and example have a most beneficial effect on
            the sentiments and manners of those who are themselves igno-
            rant of the power of vital godliness.
