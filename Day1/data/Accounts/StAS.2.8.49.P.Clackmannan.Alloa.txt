   Connected with the large works at Keiller's Brae is a manufac-
tory of machinery on an extensive scale.
   Distilleries.--There have long been in the parish two distilleries,
the one at Carsebridge, and the other at Cambus, which are both
in active and constant operation. The following particulars re-
specting them have been communicated by the proprietors. At
the Cambus distillery, there are about 400 cattle fed ; about
374 quarters of malt are consumed weekly, making 6000 gallons
of spirits per week, or 3000,000 gallons per annum ; there are sixty
men employed at the works. The amount of duty paid is as fol-
lows:

Carsebridge distillery is nearly on the same scale as the Cam-
bus; and the amount of duties paid by each is nearly the same,
including the duty on malt and spirits.
   Tannery, &c.--There is an extensive tan and currying work in
Tullibody, where leather, &c. is manufactured to the value of
L. 200,000 per annum. The making of glue is also carried on by
the same company; and they have also commenced the grinding
of bones for manure, by means of machinery, driven by steam. At
these works, are constantly employed from 30 to 40 men. Their
employment is deemed a peculiarly healthy one; and it has long
been observed, that pulmonary complaints are unknown among
them.
   Glass-Works.--These works commenced at an early period, for
the making of bottles, and are said to have been first worked by
a Danish company. The buildings are extensive, covering a space
of about six imperial acres. They are most conveniently situated
for trade; and coals, at a very easy rate, are conveyed from the
pits to the furnaces, by a railway of the most approved construc-
tion. There is a pier adjoining to the works. A Joint Stock Com-
pany, in 1825, erected three additional cones, and other; buildings;
when they cnntinued the making of bottles and added that of flint
glass of a quality equal to the goods of Newcastle. This Company
continued their operations, till about 1832. Another Company then
purchased the works when, in addition to the making of bottles,
they commenced the manufacture of crown glass on an extensive
