and Newport, both of which are in this parish.  There is a
number of boats employed, some of a larger, others of a
lesser size, some of which, when the weather permits, cross
at all tides.  The tide is about half an hour later here than
at Leith.  These ferries were much more frequented before
the bridge was built over the Tay at Perth, than they have
been since.  Some of the ferrymen are sober and discreet;
others of them borrow the language and behaviour of those
who frequent the passage, especially of such whom they
look on as their superiors in rank and station.  How much
is it to be regretted, that from so many of these they often
learn to be rude and profane.  The coast extends along
the north side of the parish.  It is for the most part rocky.
The harbours at Woodhaven and Newport are very incon-
siderable, fit only for their boats, and a few sloops, which
are sometimes employed in importing coals, and exporting
corn.  On the banks of the river there are several salmon
fishings*, some of which have of late increased in value.
They are for the most part carried on by means of what is
called a Yair.  But by some, the long net with a boat is
made use of.  The salmon are sometimes disposed of at the
rate of 4 d. and even 6 d. per lb. to the people of Perth,
who export them to London, and sell them at high prices.
By others they are sent to the neighbouring towns
of Dundee and Cupar in Fise, distant about 6 computed
miles.

*A process before the Court of Session was lately commenced respecting
one of these, and most keenly agitated on both sides.  Several hundred
pounds were expended by each of the contending parties, one of whom,
the Rev. Dr Dalgleish of Scotferaig, not only prevailed, but obtained his
expences.
