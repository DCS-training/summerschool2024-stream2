   Antiquities.-The only remains of antiquity in this parish
are the ruins of two Pictish towers, lying one on each end of
the farm of Dunrobin.  Nothing remarkable is to be seen
about them, except what is common to others of the kind.
   The tower part of the house of Dunrobin is 700 years
old, and thought to be sufficient still.

   Coals-Are supposed to be in this parish, as well as in
other parishes on the coast.

   Manufactories.-There are none in this parish worth call-

any kind of work, there will remain 13,000.  Of that num-
ber, suppose 2,000 necessary for domestic concerns, there will
be a balance of 11,000.  The amount of 2,000 should be
equal to all the necessary labour in husbandry, and the amount
of 2,000 should be equal to all the necessary domestic busi-
ness in the country; so that there is at the rate of 11,000,
exclusive of children, idle in this country ever day in the
