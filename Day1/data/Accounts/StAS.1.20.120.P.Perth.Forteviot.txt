through a rock, the sides of which meet almost together,
especially near the top.  This passage is both deep and
dark.  A rumbling noise, which the water makes in its
passage through it, is believed to have given rise to the
name by which this remarkable place is known.-A little
above the Humble Bumble is the Linn of Muckarsey, a-
bout thirty feet perpendicular, which, when the water is
high, and comes foaming from the hills, exhibits a beauti-
ful cascade.-The banks of the May, and several other
places in the parish, abound with plants not frequently to
be met with, as the lithospermum officinale, astragalus ura-
lensis, etc.

   Proper Names.-Many of the names of places in this
parish are Gaelic, as Craigmor, Cairnmor, and Invermay,
etc.  As these are the names of hills and rivers, they may
be considered as very ancient; not being so liable to change
as the names of houses and farms.  It is probable, there-
fore, that they were given by the original inhabitants of
the place, and consequently must have been prior to the time
when it was possessed by the Picts; for it is believed, that
the original language of the Picts and of the Scots was not
the same.  It is worthy of observation also, that most of
these names, as Ressie, Inver or Inner, etc. are such as
abound in the wester Highlands of Scotland, in places
where the Gaelic has been the vernacular language of the
inhabitants time immemorial.  This, among many others
that might be mentioned, affords a proof that the Gaelic
or Erse language, as at present spoken in the western High-
lands, was in reality the langauge that was anciently spoken
all over Scotland, and not a modern dialect of the Irish,
brought from Ireland, and peculiar to the western districts
