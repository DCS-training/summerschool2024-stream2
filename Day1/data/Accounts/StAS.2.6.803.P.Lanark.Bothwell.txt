   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The poor are supplied from an as-
sessment fixed by the heritors and church-session, who meet once
in six months, according to the statute, examine the poor's roll,
and appoint such a sum to be levied for the ensuing half-year as
the state of the poor requires.  One-half is paid by the heritors,
liferenters, and feuars, and the other half by householders and
tenants, according to their several circumstances. The sums collected
it the different periods, when a census of the population
was taken, and the proportional increase of the inhabitants at these
several periods, will be seen below.

public-houses in Uddingstone, which may justly be considered the
nurseries of pauperism and demoralization.  The inhabitants still
cherish that reluctance to accept of public charity which long
characterized the humblest classes in Scotland. And it may be

many of the villagers are employed by Lord Douglas to work in
the garden and pleasure-grounds, or as farm-servants, and agricultural
