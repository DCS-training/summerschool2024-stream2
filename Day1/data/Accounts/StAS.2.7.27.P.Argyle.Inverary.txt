tors, one after another, have manifested a decided reluctance to
add to their own wealth by removing the smaller tenants.  The
census in 1755 gave 2751, while that in 1792 gave only 1832;
but the former was taken during an unusually crowded state of the
population, and the latter, when, owing to some temporary causes,
it appears to have been below the average.
   The following table shows the state of the population by the
census of 1811, 1821, 1831, and 1841.

   Of the above numbers there live in the village of the Furnace,

draine, 76; in that of Claonary, 52; and in Achnagol, 86,-
making the total population of the villages, 373.  The remain-

parish.  There is no register of deaths.  The average of births
and marriages is as follows:

they naturally continue to speak their mother tongue, and to teach
it to their children.  The English language is, however, gaining
ground.
   The people are rather shrewd than intellectual, and owe more
to native sense than to the acquirements of education.  They are
also a moral rather than a religious people.

   Agriculture.-Though many of the farms havebeen surveyed,
yet there is no plan of the whole from which an accurate state-
ment of the extent of the parish in acres can be made.  It has
been rated at 52 square miles and 26,000 Scotch acres; but pro-
bably 65 square miles and 41,600 imperial acres may be a more
accurate estimate.  The proportion of these which is in tillage
cannot be ascertained; the number capable of improvement is al-
so uncertain.  In the middle of last century, the land was nearly
in its original state, and it was difficult to procure tenants who
