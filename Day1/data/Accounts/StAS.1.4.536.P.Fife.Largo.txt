reined by ploughman, now perform the work to much
better purpose, and with greater speed.  Hand and horse
hoeing are practised.  When the crop is gathered, it is
preserved in the barn-yard from vermin, by being placed
upon pillars of stone, 2 feet high.  Machines for threshing
have been introduced, but do not come up to expectation;
from their very complex construction, they are apt to go
wrong; the horses have a dead draught, and are made
giddy by the circular motion.  Wherever thay can be
erected upon a fall of water, all the purposes desired will
be answered.-In the northern parts of the parish, there
are considerable plantations of fir.  Places covered with
thorns, briars, and surze, 30 years ago, are now filled with
all kinds of forest-trees, tha annual thinning of which al-
ready produces a considerable sum.  In 30 or 40 years,
wood of different kinds will be a most profitable produc-
tion.-tyhe value of land is in a high proportion increased.

-Except on the north skirts of the parish, where bear,
oats, flax, and a few wretched potatoes, are the chief pro-
duction,every person possessing from 500, down to 1 acre
of land, raises wheat almost as good as the best in Lothian.
Those only who possess farms can afford to sallow for
their wheat: but even these, as well as the smallest tenants.
raise the greatest proportion of their wheat after clover,
beans, and potatoes.  Upon the best soil, barley is con-
sidered a profitable crop, and oats the least advantageous,
unless after pasture.  Turnips and cabbage are raised with
success, for the cattles winter-provision.  The carrot, the
Swedish turnip, and root of scarcity, have not answered
expectation.  The Swedish turnip, it is supposed, will be-
come very useful, when, by experiment, the proper mode
