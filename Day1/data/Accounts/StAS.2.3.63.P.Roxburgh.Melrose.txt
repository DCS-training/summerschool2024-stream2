lation was found to have increased to 4339, of which number
2096 were males, and 2243 females.  This great increase of po-
pulation is to be ascribed to three causes,-agricultural improve-
ments, and the extensive breaking up of the waste grounds which
followed the great rise in the price of grain during the war; the
great increase of the manufacturing population upon the Gala; and
the numerous families having independent fortunes that have chosen
the neighbourhood for a place of residence, attracted by the amenity
of the situation.  The manufactures of Galashiels have been con-
tinually upon the increase, notwithstanding the pressure to the times;
and this, along with the increased amount of the resident wealth,
more than counterbalances the diminution of the population by emi-
gration, which has of late years been uncommonly great.

     N. B.-Every marriage is recorded, the parties being anxious,
from a regard to decorum, to pay a scrupulous attention to all ob-
servances; but in the registration of the births and deaths there
is great irregularity.
     The number of individuals and of families of independent for-
tune, at present residing in the parish, is 18.  The number of pro-
prietors of land, of the yearly value of L.50 and upwards, is 50.
The numbers of families is 906; and it appears that the proportion
of recorded births to the recorded marriages is only 64 to 37,-
giving 1 3/4 children to each family.  This is to be ascribed to the
fact above stated, that every marriage is recorded, but that many
of the births are not.
