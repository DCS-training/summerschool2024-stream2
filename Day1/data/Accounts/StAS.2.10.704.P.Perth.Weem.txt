       ral scenery, no uninteresting appearance.*  Descending, at the
       West end of it, from the heights of the Kenmore road, towards the
       end of summer or beginning of autumn, and looking eastward on its
       lake, its green meadows, its fields beginning to take their yellow
       tinge, and its sloping sides in many places clothed in green grass
       to the top, unwooded as it is, he will find much to admire.  A re-
       markable feature in the scene is, a ridge of hills at the lower end,
       stretching from north to south, and and appearing to be so united to the
       sides, like the base of a triangle, that the eye would seem to look
       in vain for a tract by which the waters could escape, or where
       roads could be found; and hence must have arisen its name of
       Glenquaich, from the resemblance which it hears to a basin or cup,
       to which Cuach and Quaich are the corresponding terms in Gaelic
       and in Scotch.
         Murthly, on the south bank of the Tay, and near'a mile east
       from Aberfeldy, is bounded, east and west, by the parish of Dull.
         Weem.--This part, by much the most populous, extends about
       a mile and a half on the north bank of the Tay, and is bounded
       by the parishes of logierait and Dull.
         The only probable reason which can be assigned for this dis-
       joined and intersected state of the parish of Weem, and of several
       neigbbouring parishes, has been already given, and will further ap-
       pear from an account of the Menzies family, to have been the de-
       sire of proprietors to connect their properties with their own parish
       church; but all the disadvantages which might be apprehended
       have not arisen frorn this inconvenient arrangement, as it has been
       and continues to be, the practice of ministers to perform many,
       and in some instances all, of the ministerial duties among those
       who are near them, thought they be not their parishioners
         Mountains.--The greater part of the south side of Benlawers
       is in Crannich Lochtayside, and all the north side is in Roro
       Glenlyon.  This mountain, which is 4015 feet above the level of
       the sea, is the highest in Perthshire, and among the highest in Scot-
       land.  Though all the divisions of the parish are hilly, no other
       part requires particular notice except the rock of Weem.  It is
       at least 600 feet above the low grounds around Castle Menzies at
       the foot of it, is beautifully wooded, and in some places rises up
       so steep, as to be almost perpendicular.+  It may safely be pre

       David Kadalla, it is stated that some travellers compare the scenery of Amulsec, In
