and industrious.  They enjoy a reasonable share of the com-
forts of life, and seem strongly attached to the place of their
abode.  They have long been remarkable for their charitable
disposition, not only to their poor neighbours, but also to
strangers.  They live peaceably with one another.  In proof
of this, although they have town-courts at their door, and
the sheriff-court within 8 miles of them, there is hardly such
a thing as a law-suit heard of among them.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The town of Cullen, by
its situation, has many advantages.  It lies on the post road,
which is kept in good repair.  It has, in general, good schools.
It has the advantage and accommodation of a post-office, a
pretty good butcher market, plenty of all the necessaries of
life supplied from a rich country, on the one hand, and an
ample supply of all kinds of fish from the sea, on the other,
with command of plenty of moss for fuel.  The disadvan-

good spring in the parish of Cullen but one, and that lies
without the town.  To the burn of Cullen, there is access
only at two places, and there the roads are so steep, that it is
difficult to carry up water.  The only supply, is a cistern in
the centre of the town, where water is brought in leaden
pipes from the annexed part of the parish of Rathven.  To
accommodate the town properly, they would need at least
other two cisterns.  The houses, in general, though cheap
rented, are mean and bad; and most of them being placed
with their ends to the street, it offends the eye of the tra-

or to alter the roads, and thereby render them more distant,
the inhabitants would soon be obliged to remove, except his
Lordship were pleased to make a harbour for ships to bring
coal, which would be far preferable to their present fuel.  If
