vie in Glenbriarachan, and in digging the foundation of the recent-
ly erected schoolhouse at Aldgirnaig, coins were discovered, but,
from the date. of some of them, it is clear they must have been de-
posited there subsequent to the battle of Killiecraukie.  Of that
battle, several relics were picked up.  A broken Ferara, pieces of
broken swords, and other memorials found where the action took
place, may be seen in the House of Urrard.
   Modern Buildings. -The parish is beautifully studded with mo-
dern buildings.  Most of the proprietors have added greatly to the
beauty of its natural scenery by their own elegant mansions, and
the neat comfortable slated dwellings with which they have accom-
modated their tenantry.  There is an excellent corn-mill, a dyeing
manufactory, and a saw-mill, recently erected in Pitlochry.  There
are five thrasbing-mills in the parish, and of these, two were built
lately. *

We have no means of ascertaining correctly the average num-
ber of deaths.  The two last years, 1837 and 1838 in which a regu-
lar register of deaths has been kept, can afford no proper criterion.
	 Deaths Males. Females. Under 20. 70 and above 70. Still born.   Total.
In 1837,   49       24      25          15            24            6        55
   1838,   32       16      16           9            12            3        35
   The difference in these two years arises chiefly from the grea
mortality in January 1837, occasioned,by the influenza,  which
prevailed at the same time in almost every kingdom in Europe,
