    Present Ecclesiastical State.-The present church and manse
were built in 1797-98, in a new and centrical situation for the
united parish. They do not seem to have been very substantially
executed, and are now in a state of very considerable disrepair.
The church was built to hold 500, but, notwithstanding some
temporary expedients to obtain additional sittings, is too small for
the congregation. The glebe, obtained in excambion for the two
old glebes, including the site of the manse and offices, consists of
19 acres, 33 falls Scotch, and may be worth L.18 a-year. The
stipend, by decreet of locality in 1829, which exhausts the teinds,
is L. 140, 7s. 3 1/4d., 79 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, and 2 lippies oat-
meal at 8 stones; and 2 bolls, 3 firlots, and 1/4 lippy bear, Aber-
deenshire measure; with L.4, 16s. 2d., consisting of a payment of
50 merks, and the conversion of certain services paid by immemo-
rial usage by the proprietors and tenants of Corse. The average
amount of the whole in money, at the fiars prices, for the years
1839-41, is L.209, 17s. 5 1/4d. The Bishop of Dunblane presented
Mr Alexander Seaton to Leochel in 1683. Sir William Forbes
presented Mr Thomas Reid in 1717; and since that time the
Craigievar family have exercised the patronage of Leochel. In
1727, the Earl of Rothes was patron of Cushnie, and presented Mr
Francis Adam in 1745. In 1762, the patronage of Cushnie was
acquired by John Lumsden of Cushnie, and has continued in his
family since. Sir John Forbes, Bart., and tbe Rev. Henry Tho-
mas Lumsden, as patrons of the respective old parishes, are alter-
nate patrons of the united parish.
    Nearly at the eastern border of the parish there is a chapel, in
connection with the United Associate Synod. The emoluments
of the clergyman are L.60, a house, and five acres of land, paid
by the hearers. Six or seven families in the parish attend this
