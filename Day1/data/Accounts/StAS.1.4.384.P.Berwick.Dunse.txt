   Manufactures.-There are no manufactures carried on
here to any great extent; an woollen manufacture is to be
set on foot at Whitsunday first, the houses are building,
and the spinning machines are already brought from Eng-
land.  There is a very small tannery; but it is in contem-
plation to have one soon upon a large scale by a subscrip-
tion, in shares of at least L. 25 the share, by the inhabi-
tants.  Hides to the extent of L. 400 a-year have been
bought here by commission, and sent to Haddington,
where they are tanned, the expence of carriage, L. 33.
We have here a very large bleachfield.

   Proprietors, etc.-The number of heritors is above 40,
12 of whom possess property from L. 100 to L. 2000 a-

to 30 or 40 acres; only a few of the principal heritors
reside.  Robert Hay, Esq; of Drumelzier is proprietor of
one half of the parish; he resides at Dunse castle, a large
slately venerable old building, situated about half a mile
above the town, and commanding an extensive view to
the south, as far as the Cheviot hills. It is surrounded
with rising grounds on the west and north, and the beau-
tiful hill of Dunse Law on the north east.  On the north
and west too, are several hundred acres of thriving plant-
ing, much of it very old.  In the bosom of this planta-
tion is a fine bason of water called the hen-pond; it is a-
bove a  mile in circumference, and in summer vast num-
ners of wild ducks resort to it.

   Stipend, School and Poor.-The stipend is 66 bolls 1 fir-
lot barley, 66 bolls 1 firlots oats, 64 bolls meal, and L. 40
in money, with 91 1\2 acres glebe.  Mr Hay of Drumelzier
