space included by these flag was filled to a confiderable depth, 
with a fine whitish sand, among which the urn was standing 
in an inverted position.  Upon removing the urn, something 
of a soft slimy nature was found upon the sand, which, pro-
bably, might be the ashes of human bones.  A large urn, 
surrounded with five small ones, was found in the bottom of 
a cairn of stones about a quarter of a mile distant, and enclosed 
in a similar manner.  This large camp has two smaller ones 
in its view; one of them to the north westward, upon the 
highest top of the hill, and the other to the south eastward, on 
the top of a little hill in Covington parish, each about the 
distance of half a mile.  The first of these appears to have
been surrounded with two walls, between which there has 
been a deep ditch.  The walls have been built of large rough 
stones, such as are found upon the hill.  A vast number of 
them still remain upon the place.  This fortification has like-
wise been of a roundish figure. 

   On the top of a little rising ground, about half a mile W.
from the village, there has stood one of those long stones

to have been fixed.  From this place, which is connected 
with the plantations of Westraw, there is a delightful view of 
the house and enclosures of Garstairs, on the opposite side of 
the river. 
   The house of Westraw, or Westerhall, (as it is sometimes
spelt in old writings), is probably ancient; but it has under- 
gone so many alterations, that it has lost, in a great measure, 
the appearance of antiquity.  The lands of Westerhall were 
given to Sir Adam Johnston of that ilk, in the time of James 
II.  King of Scotland, in reward of his loyalty, and, in parti-
cular, for his activity in suppressing the rebellion of the Earl 
of Douglas.  (Vide Crawford's Peerage.)  It is probable
