   Flax.-The people have been in the practice, for some
years past, of cultivating flax in small quantities.

   Grain sent out of the Parish.-This parish sends consider-
able quantities of oats, oat meal, and barley, to the Aber-
deen market, but how much cannot be known; the quanti-
ty produced within the parish is considerably greater, than
what is consumed by the inhabitants.

   Time of Sorving and Reaping.-Wheat is sown in the
month of October, pease, oats, and rye as early in March as
the weather will permit.  The bear or barley is sown in the
month of May, and is generally reaped betwixt the middle
of August and the 10th of September.  The oats, wheat,
rye, etc. are reaped in the course of the month of Sep-
tember, or betwixt the beginning of September and the 
middle of October.  There is generally a rich crop of hay
produced from the fields which have been carefully prepared,
and it is generally cut down in the beginning of July; the se-
cond crop is well advanced about the end of August, but it 
is seldom used otherwise than for pasture.

   Number of Horses, Cattle, and Sheep-A good many cattle
and sheep are fattened upon turnip, etc. for the Aber-
deen market, and draw very good prices to the farmer.
