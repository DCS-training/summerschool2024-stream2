The first annual Report has been published; it contains a list of
the curiosities, &c. which have been presented to the Institution.
  Fuel.-Peat is the fuel most generally used, and is procured
from a moss in the parish.  The inhabitants of the town are sup-
plied in a great measure from the islands, where the peats, are of a
superior quality.  The more. wealthy,and respectable families use
coals, which are brought from Newcastle and Sunderland.

                    MISCELLANEOTTS OBSERVATIONS.
  Since the former Statistical Account was published, many im-
provements have taken place; for instance, the increase of carts
from 12 to 140, and of ploughs in the same proportion, demon-
strates that there must have been some advancement made in agri-
cultural improvement. Still, much remains to be done; an un-
less a better system of farming, and a regular rotation of crops, be
adopted, more substantial and comfortable farm-steadings erected,
and the lands to a certain extent enclosed, agriculture must remain
stationary, and the peasantry cannot be raised to that respectabi-
lity which is so desirable, and so conducive to the interest of the
proprietor, and comfort of the tenant.  The number of horses in
the parish is 204; of ploughs, 91.
  The burgh has greatly increased in wealth and prosperity, dur-
ing the last forty years, from the regular increase of the shipping,
If the herring-fishing succeed, and a station be established, it will
tend still further to promote the prosperity of the place.
