a day-laborer, in summer, 1 s. a-day, or 1 s. and his vic-
tuals, in winter, 10 d.; a wright from 1 s. 2 d. to 1 s. 6 d.;
a mason, 1 s. 10 d.; a tailor, 8 d. and his victuals.  Wea-
vers earn from 1 s. 4 d. to 2 s. a-day:  when trade is brisk,
an active workman will gain much more; for as he usual-
ly buys the yarn which the manufactures, his profits from
the sale of his cloth are, in this case, very great.  It is to
be observed, however, that they are seldom more than 9
months engaged in weaving; that is, from Martinmas to 
the end of August, or beginning of September, when the
lint-harvest commences.  The scarcity, and the consequent 
high wages of men servants, are chiefly owing to the num-
bers now employed in weaving, tempted by the profits
made in this branch of manufacture*.
