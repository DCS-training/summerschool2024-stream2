and 100 merks for communion elements, with a manse and
glebe of about 5 acres.  The King is patron.  A part of
the old abbey church was repaired at a considerable ex-
pence in 1772, and is now used again as the place of wor-
ship.  The manse was built a considerable time before the
Revolution, and was raised and repaired once and again;
the last reparation was in 1782.-The state of the school is
but indifferent.  The schoolmaster has only 100 merks
Scots from the heritors, and the only perquisite is L. 20
Scots from the session, as precentor and session-clerk, with a
trisle he receives for each marriage and baptism.  The en-
couragement being so little, we sometimes want one alto-
gether.  Some boys or girls, in their parents houses, begin
to teach for a trisle of quarter payment.  There may be a-
bout 100 scholars among them all.-The number of poor
is 45.  The annual sum expended for their relief, is L. 10
Sterling, produced by the collections in the church, and
the interest of a small sum appropriated for them.  They
are not destitute poor, or such as do not work generally
for themselves; but many of them being old and sickly,
get in proportion to their need.  But they are chiefly sup-
plied by the charity and benevolence of the gentry and
farmers of the parish.  There are not above 6 on the roll,
who at any time beg in or out of the parish.  Lady Ann
Stewart, spouse to Baron David Ross of Balnagown, mor-
tified 3000 merks Scots for the use of the religious poor,
within the presbytery of Tain, and left the ministers of it
patrons of laid fund.  The interest of it is divided once in
the 2 years,  and the different parishes in the  bounds get
in proportion to the character of the religious poor in each,
so far as it will go; some parishes 30, some 40, some 50
merks at each division.  Sometimes one parish will get
more, sometimes another; but not designed for beggars,
but for aged and reduced people of a good character.  And
