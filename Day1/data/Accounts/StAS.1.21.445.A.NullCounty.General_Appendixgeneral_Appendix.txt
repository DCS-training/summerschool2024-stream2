better, and this has been tried.  To keep out-lying black
cattle in condition, coarse hay is put up in small inclosures,
near their pastures, and from thence the farmer feeds them
as he sees necessary.  Potatoes are preserved without much
difficulty, in pits, or in low houses, all the year round.
   It would be well if we were as attentive to the constitution
and temperament of the body as to the produce of the earth;
but all the seasons find us in the use of the same dress; and
hence it is easy to account for the frequency of rheumatisms.
The dress which is warm enough in winter, is certainly too
warm for summer.  Perhaps it is worth notice, that husband-
ry implements, though high priced, and generally good, are
little attended to; the climate is left to work its effects upon
them, and actually destroys more of them than the culture
of the earth.

   Soil.-The soil is of three kinds.  1st, The deep holms
along the course of Annan; an excellent pasture soil, and
with plenty of manure, yielding rich crops; but it is greedy
of manure, which is easily accounted for.  The level appear-
ance of these holms, and their situation, indicate that they
are deposits formed by the river; and the light colour, and
looseness of the soil, give reason to suspect an over mixture
of sand, or broken particles of freestone.  Let it also be ob-
served, that the floods of this river, are suddenly down from
the hills, and bring little or no richness along, to fertilize
the deposits made by it.
   2dly, We have a light loam, of different shades, from a
bright red colour, to a dark brown, or even black.  This
light soil is good, and it amply returns all the kinds of ma-
nure which are given it; but without manure it has no great
strength.  The bright tinge is probably given it by the under
