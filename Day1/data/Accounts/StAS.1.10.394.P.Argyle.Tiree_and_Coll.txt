     Statistical Account

   Extent.-On the W. the prospect from this parish is
bounded only by the Atlantic Ocean.  The Isles of Barra,
Uist, Sky, Rum, Egg, Canna, and Monk, with the hills of
Morven, Moidart, Morthir, Arasaig, and Cnoidart, are seen
at a distance, with Ardmurchan and Mull more in the
neighbourhood, and at near triple the distance, Isla, Jura,
Collonia, and Scarba, with the mainland of Argyle, may be
discerned.  The parish extends, nearly in a straight line,
from W. by S. to E. by N. about 29 English miles, includ-
ing the sound.  Of this extent, Tiry is about 11 miles long,
and near 2 1/2 broad, and Coll about 14 long and 2 broad.
The whole contains nearly 25000 acres.

   Surface, etc.-The coast is mostly rocky, intersected with
many beautiful sandy bays, some of them a mile broad at the
head.  The Bay of Gott is about 2 1/2 miles round the head;
and the ground so firm, that a horse at full gallop, makes an
impression not above half an inch deep.  About the half of
Tiry is arable, interspersed with small rocks and rising
grounds.  There are five or six green hills; three of them
from 200 to 300 feet above the level of the sea.  There are
24 lakes, covering about 600 acres, some of which might be
easily drained; trouts cannot live in them, owing to the in-
credible number of eels.  There are no marshes and scarce-
ly any dangerous bogs; for though a great part of this flat
surface, in a rainy season, be wet, the bottom is either rock
or firm sand.  In the interior parts, about 1200 acres of
ground were, till within these three years, common to the
whole inhabitants, but they are now inclosed and included
in the adjacent farms.  This ground is mostly heath, of very
small growth.  The soil seems to have been of considerable
depth, though, having been often cut for fuel, the rocks are
now exposed.  At every bay lies invariably a tract of sandy
