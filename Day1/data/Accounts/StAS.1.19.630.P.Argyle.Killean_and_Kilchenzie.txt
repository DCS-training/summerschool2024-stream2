   Agriculture.-As there are but few inclosures in the pa-
rish, agricultural improvements are not greatly advanced in
it.  From the attention, however, which some of the heri-
tors have of late given to these matters, there is reason to
believe that the face of the country will soon put on a bet-
ter appearance.  The Duke of Argyle makes it a cove-
nant in the leases which he gives his tenants, that they shall
drain and inclose to a certain extent specified; and his Grace
employs a skilful improver to superintend the operations.
   The average returns throughout the parish is supposed
to be, from oats 3 1/2; from bear about 6; from potatoes
from 12 to 15; potatoes are almost the only green crop cul-
tivated by the farmers.  The quantity of beans and peas which
is sown is not considerable; but there is reason to believe, as
they answer well, that the cultivation of them will be more
attended to in a very short time.  The farmers are also be-
ginning to find the advantage of having some clover and
rye-grass, and the cultivation of these articles will probably,
in a few years, be very considerable.  A few have raised
turnips, and no doubt many would do so if the lands were
inclosed.  The greater defect in our farming, is the want
of a proper intermixture of green with white crops.  The
farmers, and indeed the people in general, are active,
industrious, and well behaved.  No doubt their labour will
turn soon to more account, as better implements of husban-
dry are now introduced among them.  Many, instead of
the old Scotch plough and 4 horses, use now Small's light
plough and only 2 horses, and a few have laid aside the
driver.  More attention is also paid to the breed of horses
and black cattle.  There is only one considerable sheep-
stock in the parish, in a mountainous farm.  All the far-
mers have a few for their own use; these are of the old
small white-faced kind, which have more delicate flesh
