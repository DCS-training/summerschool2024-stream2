devise the means of employing actively all the inmates who are
capable of engaging in any sort of works and the males, besides
the out-door work which the late acquisition of additional ground
has given opportunity for, are employed in such other work about
the house as they can assist the servants in ; and it is hoped that
in a short time the introduction of basket-making, weaving, &c.
may be effected with advantage.  The females are employed in
assisting the servants, and in sewing, knitting, spinning, &c.
   The details of the management of this institution are entrusted
to the same committee (annually appointed,) who superintend the
Infirmary, and the general body of managers meet twice a-year
specially for the business of the asylum, besides holding occasional
meetings when requisite.  The funds of this institution having
been derived entirely from voluntary subscriptions and bequests,
the heavy expenses incurred in the purchase of ground, and the
erection of the buildings, have hitherto rendered the managers un-
able to make the rates of board at which patients are received, so
low as they would have wished, especially in regard to the class of
paupers, 10 of whom, as already mentioned, are maintained gratis
in terms of the agreement with the magistrates on commencing
the institution.  Another is received without board in terms of a
bequest by the late Mr Innes of Balnacraig.  Other paupers
coming from parishes within the county of Aberdeen are received
at L.15 per annum.  Pauper's from other places pay 8s. 6d. per
week, and the higher rates are adjusted according to the accom-
modations, &c. required by the friends of the patient.
   The following table shows the chief particulars regarding the
asylum for the last seven years:

   Incorporations.-It is not necessary to inquire into the origin of
those societies among craftsmen, which are unquestionably of con-
siderable antiquity, and which have given rise ultimately to the
various incorporations in burghs protected by certain statues and
enjoying certain privileges.  The corporations of Aberdeen at the
earliest period of which correct information can be obtained, were
the Litsters, the Hammermen, the Tailors, the Skinners, the
