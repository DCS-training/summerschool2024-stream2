farmers and by tradesmen. Among all of them, there is diffused
a spirit of improvement. Within the last thirty years, the produce
has been, doubled: still much remains to be done. The  soil is
far from that state of fertility, of which it may be made capable, as
the best patches near the village are let at L. 1, 12s. per acre,
while the average of the whole arable land is about 15s. The
rent of the whole parish may be stated as follows:

  The following statement of the gross produce is perhaps near
the truth:

dairy produce of each cow, could not be rated at L. 5, without in-
cluding the value of calves reared (for none are fattened); that
a half only of the horses annually reared is sold, the other half
being required to keep up the stocks; and that a part of hay,
and the whole turnips, beapsi, and tares, are employed in feeding
cattle and horses, and ought not, therefore, to be placed to the
credit of the farm, were it not compensated b the value of old
sheep and old cows annually sold, for which no charge is made.
