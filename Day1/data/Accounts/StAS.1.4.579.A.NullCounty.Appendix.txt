   The following particulars respecting the parish of KIL
MALCOLM, (No. XXXVI.) were transmitted by the
Minister since the account was printed.  (See page 274)

   Name.- It is supposed by some, that the name of this
parish is compounded of the Gaelic word Kil, which signi-
fies a burying ground, and the name of Malcolm, and conse-
quently that it was a burial place, of some distinguished
person of that name, in former times.

   Improvements.-  The most remarkable piece of improve-
ment in this parish is by Dr Mollefon of Port-Glasgow, on
the farm of Bradefield, in the estate of Finlayson and neigh-
bourhood of Port Glasgow.  Upon this farm he has built an
elegant house, from which there is a beautiful prospect of
the Clyde, the town and the shire of Dumbarton, an extensive
view of Argyleshire, the high road leading from Glasgow
to Greencock, the towns and harbours of Greencock and
Port-Glasgow, etc.  He has judiciously subdivided and in-
closed the lands, with thorn hedges, and belts of planting.
Though of a shallow soil, it now yields plentiful crops of
oats, barley, beans and grass of various kinds.  His garden
produces the plants and flowers common in the climate;
and he raises many from foreign countries, which are useful
in the line of his profession.  These improvements do much
honour to his judgment and taste.  The lands were in a
state of nature within these 30 years.
