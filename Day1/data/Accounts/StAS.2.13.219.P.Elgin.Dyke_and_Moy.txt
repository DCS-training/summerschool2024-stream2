   shorn of some of its branches by the westerly blasts, and the sym-
   metry of its top has been thus partially destroyed, without adding
   to its picturesque beauty; but the other, with its massy and deep-
   ly-furrowed trunk, its giant branches beautifully arranged and
   grouped together, and spreading over a space measuring 67 feet
   in diameter, has, from its lower situation, escaped the ravages of
   the tempest, and is surpassed by few, if any, of the same species
   in Scotland.
   	In the garden of Dalvey, there is a venerable apple tree, which
   still blossoms riebly, and bears some fruit of inferior quality. It
   is impossible to ascertain its age but it is conjectured, with some
   appearance of truth, that it was planted by the monks of Pluscar-
   den, at the time that Dalvey, then called Grangehill, belonged to
   that priory. The wood is very much decayed, and the tree, long ere
   this, would have fallen to the ground if it had not been supported.
   In the park near Brodie House, there is a plant of Magnolia
   purpurea, grown to the height of 18 feet.
	The following list, selected chiefly from Mr Gordon's 11 Collec-
   tanea for a Flora of Moray," comprehends the rarer plants found
   within the parish:-

<TABLE>

   Hippuris vulgaris            Saxifraga stellaris *           Listera ovata
   Veronica montana                        aizoides *           Typha latifolia.
   Circma alpina                Clinopodium vulgare            Carex incurva
   Rhyncospora alba             Cochlearia Anglic                     pauciflora
   Scirpus facustris                       Danica                     tereduscula
   Eleocharis multicaulis       Erysirnurn Alliaria,                  stricta
              fluitans          Geranium pyrenaicum            Carex sylvatica
   Milium efflusurn             Corydalis claviculata          Spergula  subulato
   Epilobium hirsuturn          Cnicus heteropbyllus           Mentha sylvestris
             roseum             Petasites vulgaris             Ballots, nigra.

   	Zoology.-The roe (Cervus copreolus) is found in the Darnaway
   forest, and in the woods of Brodie. The fox (Canis vulpes), the
   badger (Ursus meles), the polecat and weasel (Mustelce), are fre-
   quently to be met with. The common hare (Lepus timidus), is
   abundant. Rabbits (L. cuniculus), burrow in great numbers
   throughout the plantations and in the sand-hills. They are very
   destructive to the crops. Notwithstanding a constant war of ex-
   termination carried on against them, it is found impossible, from
   the extent of cover, to eradicate them.
        Reptiles.-Among the reptiles may be mentioned the viper
   (Coluber berus), the adder (Anguis eryx), and lizards (Lacerto).

<FOOTNOTES>Both them are alpine plants, and, have been carried down from the higher regions
   by the river. A single specimen only of Saxifraga stellaris was found near Moy
   Carse by Dr Innes of Forres subsequently to the floods of 1829.
