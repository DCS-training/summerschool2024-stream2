bouring parishes, from which they get their peats, are
pretty much exhausted.  This readily suggests, that taking
the duty off the coal would be a great means of meliorating
the condition of the inhabitants; as, in tha case, they would
not only have fuel at a cheaper rate, but would have it in
their power to employ that time in improving their farms,
which is at present necessarily occupied in providing their
peats, which in general employs a good part of their sum-
mer work, both of themselves and their horses.  Consider-
ing the easy access that there is to coals, I think I need not
mention the scarcity of moss as a disadvantage to this pa-
rish; because, it there circumstances would induce them to
make use of coals wholly for fuel, it would, upon the
whole, be for their advantage.-  It may also be added, that
giving them longer leases, and suitable encouragement for
inclosing their farms, would be another mean of bettering
their condition, by exciting a spirit or improvement.
