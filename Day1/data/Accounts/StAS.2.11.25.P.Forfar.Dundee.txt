brics, their qualities have been varied and improved to suit the de-
mands of the markets, and in proportion as the yarns have been
improved, of which they are made by the use of machinery.
	The materials for these manufactures are obtained from Russia,
Prussia, Holland, and Brabant, chiefly from the two first; and the
conveyance of them employs a great number of ships and seamen.
Our information as to the extent of either the imports or exports
to and from Dundee, previous to the middle of the last century, is
very defective. The following table may serve to mark our state
in 1745, and the progress of our trade since that date.

	Thirty years ago almost all the linen yarns used in the manu-
factures here were hand-spun,--some of them in town, and the re-
mainder in the country adjacent. At that time the expense of spin-
ning alone was about equal to that of the yarn at present; while the
quality of the article was very inferior to what is now made. The in-
troduction of machinery for spinning linen yarn has been the com-
mencement of a new era in our manufactures,--the starting post
from which all our improvements in trade and commerce have
rapidly advanced. Unless steam power had been successfully ap-
plied to the production of a better article, and a more adequate
supply than ever the distaff or the spinning-wheel could have pro-
duced, the linen trade had never been carried on to any great ex-
tent, nor had we been able to cope successfully, either in the home
or foreign markets, with countries where provisions and wages are
lower, and less expense is incurred on the raw material.
