	Mr. James Spreull was appointed superintendent of the river in
1798, and until his death in 1824, he was enthusiastic of trade at the
that related to its improvement. The increase of trade at the
Broomielaw, in consequence of the improvements of the river, almost
exceeds belief. Less than fifty years ago, a few gabbards, and these,
only about thirty or forty tons, could come up to Glasgow; by
the year 1831, vessels drawing thirteen feet six inches of water
were enabled to come up to the harbour; and now large vessels,
manyof them upwards of 300 tons burden, from America, the
East and West Indies, and the Continent of Europe, are often
to be found three deep along nearly the whole lenght of the har-
bour. During the year 1834, about 27,000 vessels passed Ren-
frew Ferry; and at some peroids in the year between twenty and
thirty passed in one hour. A few yearr ago the harbour was only
730 feet long on one side, it is now 3340 feet long on the north side
of the river, and 1260 on the south. Till of late years there were
only a few punts and plough for the purpose of dredging the river,
now, there are four dredging-machines, with powerful steam appara-
tus, and two dividing-bells. Till lately there was no covering for goods
at the harbour, and but one small crane for loading and discharging,
now, the shed accommodation on both side of the river is most
ample, and one of the cranes for shipping steam-boat-boilers, and
other articles of thirty tons, made by Messrs Claud Girdwood and
Company may, for the union of power with elegance of construc-
tion, challenge all the ports in the kingdom. The river for seven
miles below the city is confined within narrow bounds; and the
sloping banks formed of whinstone, in imitation of ashar, are un-
equalled in the kingdom, whether their utility of theur beuty be-
taken into account.
	Till 1834 the river and harbour dues were annually disposed
of by public sale, but now they are collected by the trustees.
The following is a statement of the amount of tonnage and har-
bour dues in the years specified; In 1771, the first years dues
were L. 1021; in 1810, L. 4959; in 1812, L. 5525; in 1815,
L. 5680; in 1833, L. 20,260; in 1834, L. 21,260--exclusive of
L. 1564 for shed dues. The dues for the year ending on 8th July
1835 amounted to L. 31,497. The sum of L. 8673, which has new mode
year been added to the revenue, arises partly from the new mode
of collection, and partly from the great increase of trade. The pub-
lie are chiefly indebted for the change in the mode of collection to
