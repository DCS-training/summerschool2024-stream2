                        GREENOCK.                       415

Nine years, thereafter, an act of Parliament was obtained, impos-
ing a duty of two pennies Scots on the pint of all ale brewed in the
town of Greenock, and that for repairing the harbour of Greenock,
and other purposes mentioned in the said act, the act to continue
in force for thirty-one years from its commencement on the first
day of June 1751.
   The passing of the act now mentioned, and the great increase
of the trade and town, appear to have suggested to Sir John Shaw
the idea of giving still greater powers to the feuars than had been
conceded to them by the charter of 1741.  Accordingly, on the 2d
day of September 1751, he was pleased, as baron of the barony of
Greenock, and burgh of barony thereof, to grant a new charter, in
which the feuars and sub-feuars, and burgesses to be afterwards ad-
mitted, are authorized to meet yearly, to elect nine persons to be
magistrates and councillors of the burgh, whereof two to be bailies,
one to be treasurer, and the other six to be councillors, with power
to the said bailies and their successors in office, to administer jus-
tice to the inhabitants; and to the bailies, treasurer, and council-
lors, to manage the funds and common good of the town and ba-
rony; to make laws for the better government of the same; to ad-
mit burgesses on payment of not more than thirty merks Scots,
on the admission of each burgess; and generally to use and exer-
cise all privileges and jurisdictions as freely as the magistrates and
council of any other burgh of barony in Scotland do, or may do,
-the baron bailie for the time being having a cumulative juris-
diction with the bailies to be chosen by the inhabitants.
   It is, we believe, a singular provision in this charter,--singular we
mean at that period,--that it gave to the electors not only the right
of choosing the nine persons who should be invested with the power
of administering the affairs of the town, but also the right, within
certain limitations, of fixing and determining by their vote, which
of that number should hold the offices of magistrate and treasurer.
   When we consider the period at which this charter was grant-
ed, the unwillingness which men feel to resign into other hands
the power which they and their ancestors have possessed, and the
universal prevalence of the close or self-election system in the
royal burghs of Scotland, it is scarcely possible for us to exceed
in our admiration of the enlightened liberality and disinterested-
ness of the man by whom this precious boon was conferred.  Of
the wisdom and sound policy of the measure, as it respects the in-
terests of the town of Greenock, and we may add, its baron supe-
   RENFREW.                            Ee
