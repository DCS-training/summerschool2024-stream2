				PARISH OF DUNNICHEN.

		PRESEYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name and Boundaries.--SOME difference of opinion exists con-
cerning the origin of the name Dunnicken. Most people derive it
from Nechtan, a Pictish chieftain, who is said to have resided in the
parish. But although it has been the uniform practice of the Gael
to name persons from their place of residence, they never named
places from persons. I am, therefore, disposed to think that Dun-
nichen is a corruption of Dun-Achan, the hill or fort of the val-
ley. This is exactly descriptive of the hill of Dunnichen, which,
on the north, looks down on the lochs of Rescobie and Balgaies;
towards the east, upon the whole valley of the Lunan; towards the
west, upon Forfar and its contiguous loch, and through Strathmore,
until the view is bounded by Shehallien and the Perthshire Gram-
pians. From the west of this hill the water flows down through
Strathmore, and from the east it flows towards the Lunan and
Lunan Bay. From the south side of the hill a low shoulder is
projected, on which there once stood a fort built with dry stone,
without any cement. It is agreed at all hands that the parish de-
rived its name from this fort or castle. The foundation of a si-
milar fort is still visible on the hill of Dunbarrow, a detached
part of this parish.
	The parish consists of three estates or properties, detached from
each other; and in whole contains 4024 Scotch acres.
	Topographical Appearances.--There are no elevations in this
parish which can claim the name of mountains. The hill of
Dunnichen is the most elevated part; its highest pinnacle was
ascertained to be 800 feet above the, level of the sea. This
hill, with a few exceptional, is covered with soil, and is planted or
cultivated to its summit. The hill of Dunbarrow may be about
700 feet above the sea. Dunnichen House, situated near the
