ing to any perfection in the summer.  Even our lesser
farmers are sensible of the great advantage of turnips
and sown grass; but as they have almost all some sheep,
and are unwilling to keep them during the winter, they
choose rather to forego this advantage.  The better fort
of farmers endeavour to enforce winter keeping; but
the attempt is generally very unpopular and trouble-
some, and oft-times ineffectual.  It is to be hoped, that
it will succeed better by degrees.-Every family raises
a certain quantity of potatoes.  The farmers raise them
often without dung, and even in the grounds that are
most exhausted.  They plough the ground 3 or 4 times,
and plant them after the plough in the end of April or
beginning of May.  They harrow them at different
times; and sometimes give them a very shallow plough-
ing before they begin to spring above ground.  This
they find lessens the trouble of hoeing, but it renders
them somewhat later.  Planting them without dung, has
also this effect; nor is the crop so rich as it would be
with dung; but it is still tolerable, if the ground be kept
clean, and the potatoe is thought better in quality.
   For barley or bear, it is the practice here, and through
all Murray, to give 3 ploughings; one after harvest,
one in April, and the last, with dung, from the middle
of May to the 8th of June, which is thought the best
time for sowing this grain here.  For oats after bear,
they give one ploughing in spring for oats, after ley
or grass, they plough after harvest, or after the first
strong frost.  Sometimes they give a rib furrow to the
ley in harvest, or early in autumn, in order to rot the
sward in due time.  For a second or third successive
crop of oats, and for a crop of rye, they almost always
give a rib furrow after harvest; and this is found to
