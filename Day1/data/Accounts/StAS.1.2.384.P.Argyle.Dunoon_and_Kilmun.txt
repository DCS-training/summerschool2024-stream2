the country is agreeable.  It enjoys an extensive prospect of
the firth of Clyde; at the opening of which, stands the rock
of Ailsa, about 30 miles from Dunoon, by which, on that
side, the view is terminated.  The foreign and coasting trade
of the Clyde, are perpetually passing, and along the coast,
the hills are skirted with woods of considerable value.  The 
ploughed part of the ground in the parish, is, in general, light

stead of the island of Lismore.  It contains somewhat more

inhabitants, from what it was some years ago.  For half a

is situated, was once surrounded by the sea; and the minister's
glebe has a bank of sandy clay in it, which seems to have been for
