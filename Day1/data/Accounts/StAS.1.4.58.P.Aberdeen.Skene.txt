and scrophulous diseases;  but they are rarely applied to
for relief.  The tendency which the lands have in general
to minerals, operates to their disadvantage; being inimical to
vegetation, and quickly consuming manure of every kind.
There is a lake of considerable extent, the lake of Skene,
about a measured mile in length, and something more
than 3-4ths in breadth.  It is visited, especially in winter,
by duck, geese, and occasionally by swans; pike and eel
in great abundance, and of considerable size are found in it.
The pike is good, I believe, at all seasons, it can be caught.
The eel is in greatest perfection towards the end of Sep-
tember, and beginning of October, when it quits its sum-
mer-quarters, and proceeds down the burn which flows
from the loch.  A canal from the lake to Aberdeen, fit
for navigating boats of an ordinary size, has been projected.
The scheme is certainly practicable, and would, if carried
into execution, be of considerable advantage to this parish,
and the country around it.  A cut of about 16 measured
miles in length, through a country sufficiently flat for the pur-
pose, is all that would be required, without, I should think,
the aid of almost a single lock.  But the country must be far-
ther advanced in cultivation, before such a scheme, I sus-
pect, can or will be attempted.  The hills are in general
green and rocky.  Moorstone and granite are to be found
in abundance, and are used in building.

   Population.-The population does not appear to be ma-
terially different from what it was 10 or 20 years ago.
That it is on the increase, manifestly appears from the re-
gisters of marriages and baptisms, which have been accurate-
ly enough kept.  The population, according to Dr Web-
ster, was 1251.  About the 1777, it was 1306.  In 1787,
it was 1256.  The amount at present, is 1233, of which
572 are males, and 661 females.  There are no towns nor
