     Statistical Account

where potatoes are cultivated with great care, and of late
they constitute the principal food of the inhabitants.

   Climate and Diseases.  -The country being mountainous
and adjacent to the western ocean, heavy rains are fre-
quent in spring, summer, and autumn.  The winter is ex-
tremely stormy; snow is sometimes very deep, and frost is
generally of short duration.  The inhabitants are common-
ly very healthy, and many of them live to a considerable
old age.  The most prevalent diseases are the small-pox,
fevers, and colds.

   Rivers.  -There are several rivers in the parish, all of
which abound with trout of an excellent flavour.  In dry
weather all the rivers are fordable; but, owing to the heavy
rains that fall of the mountains, they often rise very sud-
denly to a great height, which renders them wholly un-
passable.

   Roads.  -The roads are extremely bad, especially in win-
ter.  The best is a part of the great road on the east side of
the parish, which leads from Inverary to Campbelton.  It
was made by the spirited exertions of the Duke of Argyle,
assisted by the gentlemen of the county.  In some places
it is formed on the sea-shore, through a ridge of ruggid rocks, 
24 feet at least perpendicular above the sea.

   Mines and Mineral Springs.-In that part of the parish
that belongs to Sir James Campbell of Inverneil, there is a
lead mine that had been wrought several years ago.  In 
the neighbourhood of the mine a few mineral springs
make their appearance; but no experiments of the virtue
of their waters has yet been made.
