dare not shoot a hare or a patridge, on his own farm or in
his own garden, but like a poacher or a thief; and that o-
thers may come and do so at his very door, to his great mor-
tification, and perhaps to the injury of his crop.
   Surely the tax on licences of this kind can be no mighty
object for the revenue; and it aids in supporting and rivet-
ting this purse proud and unjust procedure.  In truth, those
arbitrary acts are the vilest vestige of feudalism and aristocra-
cy now remaining in our free and happy land; and it is to
be suspected that Britain may one day sadly mourn their ef-
fects: For nothing can have a stronger tendency to ener-
vate and enslave the inhabitants of any country, than a prohi-
bition of the use of arms, to which these laws eventually do
amount.  In the time of need, they wdl neither know how
to load nor fire.  And, it ever an invasion should come upon
us, we will be able to do but little in our own defence.  In-
stead of lounging over the coals in an idle morning, inactive
and spiritless as he now must do, when the operations of hus-
bandry are arrested, by the frost and snow, the peasant, sports-
man, and there is no inconsistency, especially in the highlands,
in one's being both, was wont to range over the fields and
hills, with his dog and his gun, in manly exercise, which
gave health to his body and vigour to his mind.  On this sub-
ject, it is frequently observed, and the observation seems just,
that there was greater plenty of all sorts of game before these
confinements than since.  And the reason is pretty plain.
Every body almost then had an interest in destroying hawks
and other ravenous animals, and likewise in taking care
of the eggs and young in the spring; whereas now, as they
are to have no share either of the pleasure or profit after-
wards, to use no stronger language, they are entirely careless
and indifferent about the matter.
