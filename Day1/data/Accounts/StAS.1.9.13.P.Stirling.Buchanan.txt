     of Buchanan.

united parish came by degrees to be called the parish of
Buchanan.  Inchcailloch signifies "the island of the Old
"Women;" so called, because in former times there was
a nunnery there.  The parish of Buchanan has been reck-
oned 18 computed miles long, and 6 broad.  The cultivated
part of the south end lies east and west between the moor of
Buchanan and the river Endric.  A long tract lies along
the north side of Lochlomond to the upper end of the pa-
rish, near which there are two glens crossing the parish from
east to west, Glendow and Glenarclet, both of which are
inhabited.

   Rivers.-The Forth has its source in the upper end of
this parish.  From several springs, and from rains in these
high grounds frequently falling, there is collected a small
burn or rivulet, which runs down Glenguoi into Glendow,
and by the addition of several large burns in that glen it
is considerably increased:  At the lower end of the glen it
is called the water of Dow, and below that the water of
Duchray, (as it passes by the place of Duchray), and not
till it passes by the church of Abersoil is it called the Forth.
This river takes its course through Monteith by Stirling. 
The river Endric, which is the boundary of this parish in
the south, has its source in the west end of Dundaff, or
Fintry hills, and runs through the parishes of Fintry, Kill-
cairn, and Drumen, till it reaches the parish of Buchanan,
where it flows in beautiful curves through the fertile haughs
(or flats) of Buchanan and Kilmaronock, and falls at last into
Lochlomond.  This river in the winter season, when the
loch is full, covers a great part of the lower grounds on
both sides of the parishes of Buchanan and Kilmaronock,
and when the water lies dead and goes off gradually it en-
riches the ground; but the floods have often proved hurtful
