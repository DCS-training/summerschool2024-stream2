with great care and industry, sometimes with the plough,
but more frequently with the spade and hoe.  The average
produce of an acre is about 30 bolls; and about 100 acres
are every year appropriated to the culture of this most va-
luable root.
   All who possess any portion of land, however small, raise
flax sufficient for their own domestic purposes, but very
little for sale.  about 20 or 30 acres may be annually oc-
cupied with this kind of crop, which, in general, succeeds
very well.  About 250 acres are every year sown with
clover and rye-grass.  In some cases, a crop of wheat has

of potatoes, and with very good success.  There is little

produce of an acre is about 5 Ayrshire bolls, equal to as ma-
ny English quarters.  The prices of grain, and of other pro-
visions, need not be particularly specified here, being much
the same as in the other parishes in the neighbourhood.

which draws a considerable concourse of people.  As many
of these meet for business more than for amusement, this
race, in some measure, answers the purposes of a fair.

and climate, this parish has an ample compensation in its
minerals, particularly coal and lime.  On the north side of
the parish, Mr Campbell of Auchmonnach has a large field
of lime-stone; but, as it happens to be 3 miles distant from
the nearest coal, little advantage has hitherto been derived
from it.  As the demand for lime, however, is yearly in-
