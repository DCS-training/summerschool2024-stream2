The return to Dr Webster, in 1755, was only 2029.  The
upper part of the parish, however, was some time ago great-
ly depopulated, by the accumulation of small farms into
large ones.  The number of births, at different periods, if
the parochial records are to be trusted, will appear from the
following table:

   There is no register of burials kept in the parish; there-

   Agriculture and Roads.-About four fifths of the parish is
