corps.  They are in general sober and economical; enjoy, in
a reasonable degree, the comforts and advantages of society,
and, on the whole, seem pretty well satisfied with their condi-
tion.  Their situation, however, might be meliorated, by
greater exertions of industry, and by superior knowledge of
agriculture, and the other arts of civil life.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Coals are the fuel used here.
They cost from 4 s. 6 d. to 5 s. per boll at Dundee.  There
are some peats, of a bad quality, and dearer than coal, used
for kindling fires.  Roads were kept in tolerable repair by
the statute labour, till last summer, when it was commuted.
Now there are turnpikes, of whose utility many are not yet
satisfied, though it is hoped they will be so, when the roads
are completed.  The general scarcity, in 1782-3, was felt
here.  The kirk session bought meal for the poor, and sold
it at a reduced price.  Oat meal sold, in summer 1783, at 1 s.
3 d.; pease and bear meal, at 11 d. the peck.  The poor, in 
some of the hilly countries, bought coarse flour, and mixed
in with bran, of which they made bread.  Hence the miser-
able state of the country may easily be conceived.
