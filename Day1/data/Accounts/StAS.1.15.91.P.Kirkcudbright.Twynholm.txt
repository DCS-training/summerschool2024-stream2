ty of weights and measures, which universally prevails both in
England and Scotland, demands the attention of the Legisla-
ture.  In London a stone weight of several commodities is 16 libs

quantity of the same goods is only 14 lib. ditto; in Dumfries,
or in that part of this county that lies upon the other side
of the river Urr, a Scotch stone of any commodity is 24 libs;
in New Galloway, which is in the same county, it is 26 lb, and
in all this  part of the country round Kirkcudbright, it is 28
libs. ditto:  In other places, only 22 libs. make the stone.
Almost every county in England has its bushel, and every
county in Scotland its peck, all differing one from another.
The Winchester bushel is now generally used in this county,
to measure all sorts of grain; and an hundred weight of pota-
toes and a peck are the fame.
