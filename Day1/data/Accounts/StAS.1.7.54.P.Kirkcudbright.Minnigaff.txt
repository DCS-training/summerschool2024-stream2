quantities.  They both taste and smell strongly of rushes;
and this flavour, although uncommon, is to most people

are one or two more which are 20 or 30 feet higher
but, arising from a more elevated base, their altitude is not
so striking.  There are many others of a less considerable
height.-These mountains, though apparently barren, are
not unproductive.  Large quantities of lead have been dug
from their bowels.  The military road from London to
Dublin passes through this parish for several miles.  It was
in making this road, in the year 1763, that a piece of lead-
ore was accidentally discovered by a soldier, who was at
work.  This important discovery was first made in the pro-
perty of Mr Heron of Heron.  It produced, at one time,
