are often allowed to run into natural grass.  The lower
part of the parish is found to produce good crops of hay,
and early and rich pasture, which are chiefly applied to
fattening cattle for the Edinburgh and Glasgow markets
that being found more profitable than rearing young ones.
As most of the farmers keep only a few cows, the dairy
cannot be reckoned a principal object.  Of late, turnips
and cabbage have been introduced into the rotation of
crops with success.  They are generally employed in fat-
tening bullocks for the markets above mentioned: some-
times used also for feeding sheep, and carried with that
view into an adjacent field.  Several acres, on the N. of
the town, are let for this purpose, at 5 L. each.  One
farmer, in the eastern extremity of the parish fattens an-
nually about 50 black cattle, and generally disposes of
them early in the spring.  Another, near the town, has
at present 40 in the stall; and a third, 30.  There are
several pretty large farms in the parish.  One grazier rents
ground to the extent of 700 L. a-year in this parish, and
400 L. more in two of the adjoining.-Potatoes are much
cultivated, especially in the neighbourhood of the town.
Though there be a lint-mill in the parish, very little flax
is raised.
   Lime is often applied to summer fallow for wheat and
barley.  There is an excellent seam of lime-stone in the
parish, which is sold at 1 s. 6 d. the boll of Linlithgow
barley measure, or 3 d. the Winchester bushel.  There is
good shell marl in the loch; and, some years ago, consi-
derable quantities were dragged from it; but this is now
given up, as marl is thought to have little effect on
grounds that have been previously limed; which is general-
ly the case in this parish.-The inhabitants are chiefly sul-
plied with milk and butter by people in the town, who keep
