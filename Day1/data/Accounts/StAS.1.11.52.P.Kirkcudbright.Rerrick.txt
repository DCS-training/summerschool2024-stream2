   From certain appearances it might, at first view, be con-
cluded, that this parish had decreased greatly in its population
during the last 50 years, there being several large farms now
occupied by one tenant only, which at that period was divided
among many.  One of these in particular, which pays about 500 L.
does not contain above 19 souls.  And there are 5 other farms,
in which tradition says there then lived about 50 families;
whereas they do not at present contain above 20.  But to these
plausible arguments for depopulation, are opposed the follow-
ing facts: In the 1st place, There never was any emigration
from the parish during this half century, worthy to be term-
ed such: 2dly, That although in the farms alluded to, there
is but one principal family, yet they are generally pretty large,
through the number of servants that are necessary to manage
them: 3dly, That although the two villages have been but
little, yet they have been somewhat enlarged: 4thly, That
there are now families residing in several other places of
the parish, which formerly were wild, and without an in-
habitant.

   Church etc.-It may be added, as no small presumption in
favour of the increase of the population, that the parish church,
which was enlarged in the year 1743, has for these several

rebuilt; in which the heritors have shewn their generosity,
and politely expressed their respect for the order of the clergy;
which example is so completely imitated by the tenants,
and every other description of the inhabitants, that no member
of the church of Scotland need be happier than the incumbent
