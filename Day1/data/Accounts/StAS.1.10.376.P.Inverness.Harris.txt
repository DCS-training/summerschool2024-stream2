and that in each of these there are Danish forts of a more
than ordinary size.
   Besides the above mentioned monuments of Pagan and
barbarous times, there are monuments of antiquity which
deserve to be noticed with peculiar veneration; decayed mo-
numents of the piety of our Christian ancestors, which ought
to cause us blush for our country in our degenerate days.  In
travelling through the Hebrides, and contemplating the re-
mains of edifices consecrated to religious purposes, which oc-
cur to the view at almost every mile's progress, the pious
mind is affected with a mixture of awe and sorrow, while it
can hardly admit, that the overturning of the ancient church
establishment ought to be considered as reformation here.  In
Harris, where, till within a few years back, there has not
been, since the aera of our reformation from popery, so much

which the greater part of the walls, though some of them
be in a tottering condition, are yet standing, besides several
others, probably of a more ancient date, which, having moul-

still be traced, whilst tradition points out their situations, and
has carefully preserved their names.  They were either de-
dicated to saints or designed after the names of their several
patrons or founders.  Of two, in the Island of Taransay, one
was called Teampull Che, and the other Eagluis Tarain.  Tra-

Martyrology, who is called by Fordun, in the Scotichronicon,
Tarananus.  Archbishop Usher says he was bishop of Lis-
