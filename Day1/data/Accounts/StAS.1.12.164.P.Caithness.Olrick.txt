humane and judicious conduct of the proprietor, it were 
greatly to be wished that the other heritors, and every heritor
in Caithness, would adopt similar measures for the improve-
ment of their estates, and the happiness of their people.
While short leases and feudal servitudes prevail, they must 
operate as an insurmountable bar to every species of civiliza-
tion and improvement.  It is now in contemplation to intro-
duce some little branches of manufacture on the estate of 
Castlehill, which, if got effected, will be of essential benefit
to this parish and beyond it.
