     Statistical Account

   The people are, in general, sober, industrious, and courte-
ous to strangers.  They are contented with their condition,
and firmly attached to Government.  It is but justice to add,
that, in the late ferment which prevailed in some parts of the
country, they continued to express an uniform abhorrence of
all seditious and levelling principles.

   Productions.-The arable ground in Aberfoyle bears but an
inconsiderable proportion to that which is employed in pas-
ture.  Of this proportion, however, no precise estimate can
now be offered.  The fields are employed in raising oats,
barley, pease, potatoes, and flax.  Pease are not much culti-
vated, on account of the wetness of the climate.  Of potatoes
and flax, only so much is raised as is sufficient for immediate
use.  The hills are altogether occupied in the pasture of
sheep, goats having been proscribed, on account of the injury
they do to the woods.  Black cattle, of a small breed, are
reared with advantage on the lower grounds.
   It may be observed in general, that the upper part of the
parish, which occupies by far the greatest superficial extent,
consists of sheep farms; and the lower part, of cultivated
grounds.  The possessors of the sheep farms seldom raise so
much grain as is sufficient for themselves, and for their shep-
herds.  The farmers in the lower district generally raise a
little more than is sufficient for their own consumpt.  The
leases on the sheep farms are given for 9 years; those on the
grain farms for 18 years.
   The cultivation of sown grasses can scarcely be said to
have been yet introduced amongst us, a few of the more in-
dustrious tenants only laying down an acre or two, for the
benefit of their milch cows.  The culture of field turnip is
almost unknown, though practised successfully by Mr Graham
of Gartmore, at the distance of two miles only.
