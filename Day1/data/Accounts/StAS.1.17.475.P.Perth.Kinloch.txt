   Plantations, etc.-There is a good deal of hard wood,
such as ash, etc. in the parish, particularly on Mr Farquhar-

betwixt the rows, the plants in the one row standing oppo-
site to the vacancies in the other.  As the larix thrives in
every soil; as thorns do not thrive in very dry poor soils, it
