   The population seems to have decreased materially between
1755 and 1801, probably owing to the farms having been redu-
ced in number, and increased in size; the number of farmers in
1730 having been 21; in 1791, 7; now in 1836, there are 6 resi-
dent and 2 non-resident.

   The yearly average for the last seven years, according to the session registers, is
                      of births,                       13 2/7
                      of marriages,                     4

   The only heritor at present residing in the parish is the patron,
James Sprot, Esq. of Spott.
   The whole number of proprietors of land of the yearly value
of L. 50 and upwards, is 6.
   Popular Customs.-These are the same here as in other parts of
East Lothian. The custom of going about as guyzards, on the
evening before new-year's-day, once universal and not confined to
the lower orders, is now gradually failing into disuse. Old Handsel
Monday is strictly observed as a holiday, in every part of this
county; on that day, all the younger branches of a family as-
semble together, and spend the day in the house of their parents,
and all work is most scrupulously abstained from.
   Character of the People.-The farm-servants in East Lothian
enjoy the comforts of society, according to their rank in life, to a
greater degree than the working-classes in most other parts of the
country; and though the gains of the hinds or married plough-
men have, from the low price of grain, in which their wages are
paid, been for some years past considerably diminished, they are
in general well contented with their condition, industrious, and
devoted to the interest of their masters. Their ordinary food con-
sists of wheat or barley bread, mostly baked by themselves, pork
and salt herrings, potatoes and oatmeal porridge. Tea is very gene-
rally used by the females; and in the Lammermuirs oatmeal cakes

<FOOTNOTE>There is no register of deaths, but the above is the number given in the former
Statistical Account, which cannot be far from  the truth as to the present period, the
number of births and marriages, and the amount of the whole population having been
almost the same then as now. Births were 11 3/4, marriages 4 4/5, whole population 619.
