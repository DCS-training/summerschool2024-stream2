1-3 d instead of 1-6th of their farm in wheat.  There are
others, who go farther still, and make a greater proportion
of wheat; and some divide their farms into sevenths, and
take two white crops together, to make their grass farther
from the dung.  If any of these be good farming, expe-
rience must shew.  Some attempts have been made to
throw fallow out of the rotation in clay, and in its room
to sow hasty pease, or other green crops, but it has not an-
swered the intention.
   If after lint, it be meant to sow wheat, the dung should
be laid on as soon as the lint come off, and ploughed in im-
mediately; and if after clover, perhaps the best practice is
to lay the dung on as soon as the hay comes off the ground,
spread it immediately, and let the second crop cover it,
which it will do in general.  Both then are ready for the
seed furrow in good time.  At all events, never let dung
lie one moment in heaps, but let it be spread instantly, and
well divided.  A great deal of the success in farming de-
pends upon the proper management of dung.
   If it be meant to sow wheat after turnip, the tops may
be begun to be cut off some time before, and given either
to cattle, or to milch-cows; after which, they should be
taken up in October, the tops and roots cut close, and then
housed, or stowed in a temporary shade for the purpose;
and to prevent their spoiling and springing, they should be
turned over from time to time, and the soft and rotten ones
picked out; by which means they will keep very well
through the winter.  And at all times, what remains in
the ground unused, should be taken up when they begin to
shoot, which both preserves the turnip, and prevents their
hurting the ground by their running to feed.  Mr Paterson
has practiced this; and one year in a field of equal soil, and
equally prepared, he had yams, potatoes, lint, and turnip,
