   The earliest entry in the register of births is in the year 1725, and
   of marriages, in 1726.  There are no records of minutes of discipline
   previous to the year 1810, and even since that period, these
   records have not been regularly kept.

                                III.-POPULATION

     The population, taken at different times during the last eighty-four
   years, is as under:-
        In  1755, according to Dr Webster's report,                 1288
            1792, according to the last Statistical Account,        1276
            1811, as taken under the direction of Parliament,       1886
            1821,        Do.              Do.                       1570
            1831,        Do.              Do.                       1741
            1839, as ascertained by correct enumeration,            1722

      Of the population of 1831, there were 836 males, and 905 females.
   During upwards of fifty years previous to the commencement
   of the present century, the population appears to have remained
   nearly stationary.  But, during the first thirty years of this
   century, it increased between 400 and 500. This increase has
   been owing to the introduction of an improved system of husbandry
   during that period, and the great kindness of Dukes Alexander
   and George Gordon to their tenantry, and their desire to continue
   them and their families on the estate, and promote their welfare.
   It may also be mentioned, as conducing to this increase of
   the population, that Alexander Duke Gordon gave great encouragement
   to the village of Tomintoul; in consequence of which
   the village increased from 37 to 143 families during the same period.
      Since the year 1831, there has been a decrease of 19 on the
   population. This decrease is accounted for by the great failure
   of the crops during the last four years, and by the village of Tomintoul
   having been enlarged beyond the maximum of its resourcds
   for supporting its inhabitants, many of whom are now obliged to
   leave it; and also by a desire, manifested on the part of the proprietors,
   to enlarge the farms in the parish, with the view of increasing
   the comfort of those who occupy the soil; and it is more
   than probable, that, from the operation of the two last meotioned
   causes, the population will continue to decrease, at least for some
   time.
