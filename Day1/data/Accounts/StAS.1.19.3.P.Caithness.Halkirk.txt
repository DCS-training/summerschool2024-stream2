     of Halkirk.

   Origin of the Names.-The spot where the chapel for-
merly stood, and where now the kirk of the two united
parishes stands, is a small round hill, in the middle of a
large extensive plain.  From this spot, as the centre, there
is a very gentle rise, almost in every direction, to the sur-
rounding hills.  From this circumstance, it is more than
probable, the parish derives its name; for the rising ground
whereon the kirk stands is called Tore Harlogan, and the
kirk, Teaumpul Harlogan, and so retain the original Irish
names, though the parish is called by the name of Hacrigg,
and more frequently of Halkirk, which are manifestly a
corruption of the original name, Tore, olaggan.  Now, Lag-
gan, in Earse, signifies a low place, the lowest in the neigh-
bourhood, and Tore, a mount or small hill.  Thus the ori-
ginal name was compounded of Tore and Laggan; and had
it not been that the chapel was built on the small Tore, or
hill, that is, in the middle of this low place or Laggan, this
parish would have been called parish of Loggie, or Skir, a-
laggan, or Laggy, as other parishes in Scotland are called,
for the same reason, as is evident, from the low situation of
the place of worship, when compared with the rest of the
parish; whence it is very presumable, that the original
name of this parish was, Skira, Thore, o Laggan, but in
course of time was corrupted into the name Hacrigg, which
has no meaning but analogy of sound; and because the
sound Hacrigg resembles the English word Halkirk, it was
converted into that name.
   As to the name of the other parish, it is sometimes pro-
nounced Skinnet, sometimes Skinite, sometimes Skinilt,
sometimes Skinnon, sometimes Skinine.  Nothing can be
concluded from this confused variety of pronunciation;
but from the situation of the kirk, with the aid of these
sounds, I have reason to believe that the real name should
be Skiea Noylte, the Wing of the Burn; for that place goes
