sure, supply the one and relieve the other, by adopting some 
such plans as the following:
   1st, To let their lands at moderate rents and grants long lea-
ses to their tenants; with suitable encouragement for making 
improvements on their farms, (either by clearing the ground 
of stones, draining, inclosing, or bringing muirs and waste land 
under cultivation and pasture), and by allowing them a rea-
sonable compensation for what they have judiciously expended 
on such improvements.
   2ndly, To abolish all personal services, especially during seed-
time and harvest, together with miln-multures, allowing the 
miller only payment for his trouble in grinding the corn to the 
tenants. 
   3dly, To let farms of a moderate size to sober and industri-
ous tenants, even in preference to those who promise a larger 
rent, which, after all, they may not be able to pay. 
   4thly, To prevent, as well as by their own example, all
unreasonable and extravagant exactions of rent, as well as of 
personal services from sub-tenants; who too often feel the 
scourge of those petty oppressors, to whose tyranny they are 
subjected, when they are not restrained by prohibiting clauses, 
enforced by proper penaltied in their leases.  For instance, a te-
nant might by prohibited, under the penalty of forfeiting his 
lease, from letting land to cottagers above a certin sum, 
(which must, no doubt, vary according to the nature of the 
soil, and the situation of the place), as well as from demand-

   5thly, and lastly, It might be advantageous, in an age so
samed as the present for associations, to institute parochial
clubs, consisting of the proprietors, minister, and such farm-
ers of the parish, as choose to become members, to meet twice
