     Statistical Acount

halfpenny is also levied at the coal pits, upon every
horse load of coals, equal to 2d.  the cart load, besides
the conversion of the statute-labour, which had been
found altogether inadeqaute, may amount from 300l.  to
400l.  a-year.  There is a toll-bar in the parish, placed
exactly upon the side of Scotch dike, the ancient, as well
as present march between Scotland and England; the
produce of which is applied entirely toward the repair
of the post road.  There are about 10 bridges, with 1
arch, over different rivulets, and numberless smaller
ones, in the parish; besides 2 over the Elk, the one hav-
ing 3 arches, and the other 2.  I he forner, distant
1 1/2 mile from the latter, was built about 50 years ago,
at the expense of the country, from motives of huma-
nity; at least, it does not appear that there could, at
that time, be any other object in view of general con-
cern.  The parishioners, to be the W.  of the river, who
are numerous, had no access to the church, or to the
E. side, before this bridge was built, but by wading or
riding the river, or passing in a boat, when it ceased,
from flood, to be otherwise fordable.  And the boat
having been overset at one time, and many persons
drowned, in returning from church, and many indivi-
duals having loss their lives, after this event, the idea
of building a bridge, that had been long suggested, was
at lenght happily realized.
   The other bridge was only finished last summer.  It
is built upon a large scale, and has a striking appear-
ance; to which its romantic situation very much con-
tributes.  The span of the large arch is 70 feet, that of
the smaller one 45 feet; the height of the bridge to the
pass-way 46 feet, and its length 244 feet.  By this
