     of Carluke.

kirk is a very old one, 90 feet long.  There are still to be seen
within its walls, several vestiges of the Roman Catholic wor-
ship, viz.  The sount, vestry, etc. with a chancel and choir to
the east; all which shew, that it must have been built before
the Reformation.  There are here, neither Jews, Papists, not
Episcopalians.  The manse was built about the beginning of
this century; was repaired, and declared sufficient to the
present incumbent, about 29 years ago; but another repair
was found necessary very lately.

   Kirk Lands, Religious Houses, etc.-In this parish, there are
some kirk lands that pay no stipend, but have been burdened
with grass to the minister, viz. the two farms of Kirton and
Kirstile.  On the S. E. near the boule of Lee, there is a re-
ligious house, or hermitage, of great antiquity, which is called
St. Oswald's Chapel; and nigh to it there is a small field, called
Friar's Crost, which sufficiently indicates its origin.  On the W.
corner of the parish stood another Popish chapel, of which there
is now no vestige.  The place where it stood, still retains the
name of Chapel Yard; and the remains of it, it is said, were
dug up by the present proprietor.  Both these chapel yards,
and the lands adjacent, pay stipend to the minister, in com-
mon with the rest of the parish.  So also do the Hospital lands
of Easter, Wester and Middle Seats (called Hospital Shields).
These Hospital lands pay annually to the family of Lee the
sum of 60 merks (20 merks each), which that family is obliged
by charter to repay annually, along with 20 merks from St.
Leonard's Lands, Lanark, to the poor of the parishes of Car-
luke and Lanark.  The reddendo of each charter was lately
called for, and now recorded in the parish register here*.
