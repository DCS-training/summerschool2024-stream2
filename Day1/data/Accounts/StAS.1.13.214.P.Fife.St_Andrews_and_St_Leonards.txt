   Miscellaneous Observations-This parish seems to labour
under no particular disadvantages.  It enjoys several ad-

and pays 2 s. for his meal, his surplus is 4 s.  The fuel used in this pa-
rish is coal; the price of which has been formerly stated.  There are 
some mosses in the neighbourhood; and many families lay in a few peats,

the moors use turf for covering or gathering their fires they likewise cut
furze for fuel,  The wages of female servants run generally from L. 2, 10 a.

ster; footmen, from L. 10, to L. 15, or L. 20.
