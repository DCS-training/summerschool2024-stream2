become frequent, it has not yet been found that wood is
very cheap firing.
   A disadvantage arises to our farmers from the nature of
the soil.  Thin and steril, it is soon over-run with heath,
whins, or broom, when it is left ley; I say, when it is un-
ploughed and unsowed.  The use of lime does not afford a
remedy; and marl, as far as I know, has not been disco-
vered in any part of this country.  To this noxious ten-
dency of the soil, it will hardly be thought a sufficient
counterbalance, that young broom is used for thatching
houses instead of straw; that old broom and old whins serve
for fuel; and young whins, properly prepared, make ex-
cellent food for cattle, particularly for horses; sheep are
very fond of them.  One would think that their wool
might be improved by such aliment.  All vegetables con-
tain a salt and an oil, some more, some less; whins seem
to contain a good deal of both.  Certain it is, that when
horses are fed with bruised whins, they get a steek glitter-
ing pile, and grow plump and agile.  The same effect is
produced by giving them feeds of boiled corn, mixed with
salt.  On this principle it is, that some farmers, when they
stack their hay, strew salt on the different strata.  The su-
perior fineness of Spanish wool is generally acknowledged.
It is well known that the shepherds of that country lay
slates with salt on them over the pasture-ground, and the
sheep, as they go along, lick up the salt.  I have been in-
formed, that in some places, barren spots, after being pretty
well cleared of stones, are sowed with whins, which are
mowed down with a seythe, at a proper age, and bruised
for food to cattle.  In the year 1775, the crop on Dee side,
after a dry spring and summer, was far from being luxu-
riant; it is yet distinguished as the year of the short crop;
in the succeeding winter and spring, almost every body had
recourse to whins for provender to their cattle.  Some
