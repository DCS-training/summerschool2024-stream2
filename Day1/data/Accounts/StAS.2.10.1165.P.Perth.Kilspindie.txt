         Parochial Registers.--The registers of this parish consist of se-
       veral volumes, in which are also included the minutes of the kirk,
       session.   The earliest entry is dated July 27, 1656.  They are in
       pretty good order, and appear to have been regularly kept down
       to the present time.

                             III.--POPULATION.
        <TABLE>

           From the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, the population was  828
                                               in 1719,                     718
       Since 1801, it has continued nearly stationary, with the excep-
       tion of a small decrease since 1831, owing chiefly to emigration.

         Agriculture.--It is impossible to state, with any degree of ac-
       curacy, the number of imperial acres in the parish; they may pro-
       bably amount to about 6500.  Of these, about 3500 are arable,
       and in a state of high cultivation, producing excellent crops of all
       the ordinary kinds.  Potatoes are cultivated to a considerable ex-
       tent, chiefly of the red variety, and great quantities, are yearly
       shipped for the London market.   Much attention is also paid to
       the feeding of cattle, and a considerable breadth is annually laid
       out in turnip, for that purpose.  More than 200 acres of ground
       are under plantation, consisting mostly of larch, Scotch fir,and
       ash.  These plantations are in a thriving state.  About 200 acres
       are in a state of undivided common.  The remaining, Part of the
       parish, with the exception of small portions, partially cultivated, is
       in a state of permanent pasture.
         Husbandry.--Agriculture is in a flourishing state, and the sys-
       tem of husbandry that has been pursued, for many years, is very su-
       perior.  The farms are kept under excellent  management, and all
