the whole, the air is dry and healthy, except that the lower
ground is subject to fogs.  The most prevalent distempers,
not to mention those peculiar to children, are fevers and con-
sumptions; but this cannot be attributed to the local situa-
tion.  The greatest storms of rain and snow are from the E.
across the German ocean; the highest winds from the S. W.

   River.-The Eden rises about 8 miles to the W. and falls
into the bay of St Andrews, about 7 miles to the E. Being fed
by a number of rivulets, and having a pretty level course, it
is never very low, even in the driest summer.  It is not na-
vigable at present, to any distance from its mouth, owing to
the many mill-dykes, by which it is crossed.  Were it thought
necessary, for promoting the commerce of the county, it might
be made navigable, though at a considerable expence, for 12
or 14 miles; through which it has a fall probably of about 40
feet.  Next to the want of commerce, to defray the expence,
the greatest disadvantage would be, the danger of entering its
mouth, on account of shoals and quicksands.  Its banks be-
ing somewhat high on both sides, in its course through this parish,
there is little danger from land floods.  The greatest rise of
the river for there 50 years past, was in May 1782.  From the
excess of rain, our crops then failed so much, that had the
culture of potatoes been unknown, and the importation of 
grain as little practised, as in the end of the last century, there
would have been as great a famine, as in the former period.
-The Eden produces trout, pike, and a few salmon;
which last are so much diminished, by the number of seals,
which frequent its mouth, that few are caught for sale.

   Hills.-On the south-side of the parish, are the Walton and
Pitlessie hills; not considerable for their height; and connect-
ed with-each other by rising grounds.  They are covered most-
