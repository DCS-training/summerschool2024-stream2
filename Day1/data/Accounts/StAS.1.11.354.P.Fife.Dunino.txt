     Statistical Account

   Soil, etc.-This parish, though surrounded on every
hand, almost, by extensive moor, destitute nearly of what
might, at a very trifling expence, compared with future re-
turns, contribute to general gratification and indulgence, in
addition to the more intimate advantage and pleasure of indi-
viduals, is far from being barren.  Though, from the small-
ness of the extent, no perceptible variation of air, or of cli-
mate, can be naturally expected; yet this is not the case re-
specting its soil, which is considerably diversified.  Some of the
ground consists of a black and light, but tolerably fertile loam,
resting upon a gravelly bottom; while a large proportion of
it displays a soil of a deep and stiff clay, with a bed of white
and light sand.  The most just idea of it, however, will be
had from the information, that the soil, in general, is, in a
great measure, wet and spungy; in most of the farms of the
parish, frequently broken by large swamps and fens; and,
though pretty well adapted for producing corn, is principally
remarkable for crops of artificial grass and natural pasturage.
Some of the proprietors, therefore, availing themselves of this
obvious property of their estates in this district, have, with
much success, converted them into those species of farms, for
which their lands are thus so very well calculated.

   Climate and Diseases.-Denino, sheltered from no quarter
by any considerable planting or eminences, except by some
rising ground towards the S. W., is often exposed to great
winds from the sea, which, blowing with great force and
sharpness, concur with the natural coldness of the soil, in ren-
dering the frequent humidity and bleakness of the climate,
the more sensibly felt.  The air and climate are, however, of
such a nature and temperature, as to occasion but few inter-
ruptions in the health and native gaiety of the people, the
rheumatism and hysteric complaints being the chief disorders
