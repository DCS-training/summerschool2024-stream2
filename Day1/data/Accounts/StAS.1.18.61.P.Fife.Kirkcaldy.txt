     of Kirkaldy.

that eminent benefactor to society, Dr Adam Smith, the en-
lightened author of the "Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
"of the Wealth of Nations," and to have been the place of his
residence during most of the time that he was employed in
writing that incomparable book.  Dr Smith was born in
1723.  He published his Inquiry in 1776; and before his
death, which happened in 1789, he had the singular good for-
tune to see it translated into the languages, and the principles
of political economy contained in it, adopted into the systems,
of almost all the commercial nations of Europe.  He wrote
also "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."-Those who would
know more of this great man, may consult a memoir of his
life and character published in the second volume of "The
"Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh."
   In the more retired, though not the least useful or res-
pectable sphere of private citizens, Kirkaldy could reckon dif-
ferent persons, who would have been distinguished as citizens
of the first class in any community.
