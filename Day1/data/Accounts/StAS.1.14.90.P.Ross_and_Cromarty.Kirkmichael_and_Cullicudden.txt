   Soil, Agriculture, etc.-The soil is various, as might
be expected in such an extent of surface; but what
mostly prevails, is, a black light loam, on a stra-
tum of till, above a hard gravelly clay; which ren-
ders it very wet, and unfit for tillage in winter and
spring, and generally prevents the farmers from sowing
before the end of March, or reaping before the middle
or end of September.  On a considerable part of the
farms lying on the shore and wester end of the parish,
where the soil is light and sandy, on a free-stone bot-
tom, oats are sown the beginning of March, barley and
peace in April, and often reaped in the beginning of
August.  The farmers here averse to fallowing, green
crops, enclosures and winter herding, continue the same
plan of agriculture that was practiced a century ago.
Many of them, indeed, have sown small patches of clo-
ver in their little gardens for several years part; but
none of them, excepting 2, ever attempt to fallow, or
sow green-crops or grass-feeds in their fields: in conse-
quence of which these fields are over-run with weeds,
particularly quickens (or joint-weed); and their crops
are very light, in proportion to their sowing as they
have not, at an average (save on the shores), above 3
returns of barley, and 2 1/2 of oats and peace.  Instead of
Kellachye carts, with wicker-baskets of a conical forms,
and the Scotch plough, of a bad contribution, many of
the farmers begin to use small box-carts with spoke-
wheels, and a small chain plough, with feathered-sock
and curved mould-board.  On farms of 20 bolls and up-
wards, the plough is drawn by 6 or 8 oxen in bows and
yokes; and, on lesser farms, by 2 horses, 2 oxen, and
