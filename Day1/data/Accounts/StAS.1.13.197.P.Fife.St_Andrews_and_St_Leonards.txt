cy of soil.  The boundaries of this parish to the W. and S. ter- 
minate in moors, covered with short heath and furze.  Some 
parts of these moors have of late been limed and ploughed,
and have yielded a few profitable crops of corn.  The soil 
there, however, is in general too cold and wet for retaining
clover in winter.  The greater part of these moors seem sit
only for being planted with wood, and the proprietors are
beginning to attend to that useful improvement of waste
land.  The air, climate, and salubrity of the whole parish
is nearly the same with that of the city.  In common with
all the eastern part of the island, this parish is well ac-

agues less frequent than here.  The air of this corner is, in
general, too sharp for phthysical constitutions.

   Springs, Rivers, Sea Coast, Fish.-There are several ochte

mornings of April and May.  There are no lakes, canals,
or rivers, deserving the name.  In Eden and Kenlowie,
is a considerable number of trout; in the embouchure of
Eden is a flat sandy bay, abounding with large flounders; in
this bay, at low water, is gathered a very great quantity
of cockles and mussels, both of which are prized as an ar-
ticle of food for the common people, and of delicacy among
the better fort.  The gatherers, after carrying them two miles,
sell them in St Andrew's at 2 d. the measured peck.  The
mussels are used by the fishermen as bait for haddocks.  In
the course of Eden, for about a mile from its mouth, sal-
