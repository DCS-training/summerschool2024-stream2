   Minerals and Fossils.-There is a great quantity of free-
stone, but in general of a reddish colour, open and porous,
and apt to crumble when much exposed to the weather.
There is limestone, but it is said not to be of a good quali-
ty; perhaps it would have been more valued had lime been
in less abundance in the neighbourhood.  Ironstone has
lately begun to be wrought; but what deserves here parti-
cularly to be noticed is the excellent coal with which this
parish abounds, and which has been wrought for some cen-
turies.  In the west ground of the parish, besides what is
called Dysart coal, (which is 21 feet thick, with 3 feet of
coarse coal left for a roof) of which a very extensive field
remains to be wrought in the estate of Wemyss, there are
other 10 or 11 workable seams of coal, most of which have
been wrought above the level of the sea.  The principal
seam of the 10 or 11 is now working between 50 or 60
fathoms below the surface.  This seam is 10 feet thick,
but 8 feet of it is only wrought, viz. 5 feet of very fine
splint, and 3 feet of free, the other 2 feet being left for
roof.  The water is raised by a steam-engine.  The coal
is brought to the pit-bottom by horses under ground, and
then raised by horse-gins.  Coal for exportation is driven
in large waggons from the pits to the harbour of Wester
Wemyss.  The other seams in this part of the parish, which
have been wrought, are all entire below the level of the
sea, excepting one, a small part of which was wrought near
the sea, about the year 1656, at which time the water was
drawn off by horses.
