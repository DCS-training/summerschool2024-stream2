     General Appendix to [Vol. v.

Commodious houses were built, and very curious machinery,
every way proper for the purpose, was provided.  It was gi-
ven up in September 1790.  It recommenced in April 1792:
100 hands, at an average, were employed in this manufac-
tory from the year 1786 to 1790; and 80, at least, are em-
ployed at present.  It is under the management of John Smith,
Esq. present provost of Brechin, and Colin Gillies, Esq. mer-
chant here: two of our most substantial merchants, and both
of them distinguished by prudence, industry and unwearied
attention to every branch of trade in which they happen to
be engaged.
   It is needless to mention the commodities retailed in the
shops, as they are well known.  One thing however must
be noticed, that there is a greater number of shop-keepers in
Brechin at present than was ever known at any former pe-
riod, owing to the great increase of people, which occasions
a greater demand for shop commodities.

   Soil, Produce and Agriculture.-The lands around Brechin
are in general very good.  There is not much wheat sown
here.  It is commonly sown in September or October, and
from 3 firlots to 14 pecks an acre, and produces very often
from 10 to 12 bolls per acre; is for ordinary ready to be cut
down about the middle of August.  Barley sown in April
will be ready to be cut down with the wheat, and commonly
produces about 10 bolls per acre.  The crops of oats have
not been so good within there these years past: they pro-
duce, at an average, from 6 to 8 bolls per acre.  There is a
good deal of pease sown in the parish; and after the pease,
barley, with grass seeds, 12 pounds of clover and 2 bushels
of rye-grass for an acre: and if cut the first year, they will
commonly produce from 200 to 300 stones of hay, which
sells, at a medium, from 4 d. to 6 d. per stone.
