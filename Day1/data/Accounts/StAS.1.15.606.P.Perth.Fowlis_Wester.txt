     Statistical Account

   As the soil is generally too cold and moist, and the grain
therefore ripens slowly, the tenants are liable to suffer im-
mense loss by a rainy season.  Thus, in 1792, the whole crop
could only pay that smaller portion of the rent that is usual-
ly paid in meal:  and though some sold a few bolls out of
the parish that year, twice as much was purchased by other
tenants for domestic consumpt.

   Quarries-The houses of the tenants are generally one
story high, thatched with straw.  Two farm houses of one
story, and four of two stories high, are covered with blue
slate; and two of one story, with grey slate.  It might be
expected that many more would have slated roofs, since both
kinds of slate now mentioned are found in the parish.  On
the estate of Logicalmond, is a valuable blue slate quarry, let
at 50 guineas yearly; from which 500,000 slates are suppos-
ed to be sold annually, at 13 s. 4 d. the thousand.  On the
lands of Abercarney and Foulis, are quarries of grey slate,
that is, a kind of light brown freestone, which rises in broad
shelves, of an inch thick, is easily cut with the slater's knife,
and makes a pretty good, though heavy roof.  As these
quarries were never wrought to any great extent, no rent is
paid for them, but a thousand slates may be quarried for 1 L.
10 s. which will cover as much of a roof as 6 L. value of the
blue slate above mentioned.  That roof, however, will be
greatly inferior in elegance and duration.  Near the entry
to the house of Abercarney, is an inexhaustible quarry, of a
beautiful and excellent stone for building; and, on the Cul-
toquhey estate, is a quarry of the best stone for pavement in
all the country, which being soft while in its natural moist
state, shapes easily, and 20 years ago, might be quarried, cut,
and laid at 2 d. a foot; but the price is now nearly doubled.
