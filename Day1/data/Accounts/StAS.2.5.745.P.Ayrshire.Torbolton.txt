the bed of the Fail near Coilsfield House, and in the bed of a deep
ravine to the west of Auchinleck House.
	Beyond the northern boundary of Torbolton parish, it appears
to pass under the coal strata.
	Coal.--The south-western part of this parish, and also a patch
in the north-eastern quarter, are portions of the Ayrshire coal-field.
	What first deserves notice in regard to it, is the water of-Ayr-
stone, or hone. This is a variety of indurated fire-clay, which at
Enterkine, in the parish of Torbolton, at Dalmore, in the parish
of Stair, also near St Quivox manse, and at Curreath, in Dun-
donald parish, is to be found immediately under the soil, covering
the coal measures, and dipping conformably to them. It appears
to be one of the coal measures. It varies in coarseness, in hard-
ness, and also in colour, being blue, and blue with brown specks,
yellow, and brown. In all the localities in which it has been seen,
trap occurs in its vicinity.
	The strata met with in sinking the Weston pit were the fol-
lowing:

No. 1. Slaty micaceons sandstone.	No. 15	Slate-clay.

       tained organisms.		        traces of vegetable organisms.
    5. Ironshot sandstone--Slaty.	    19.	Slaty micaceous sandstone like
    6. Slaty sandstone.		                 Nos. 2 and 8.

   10. Slaty clay.                      24.   Quartzy sandstone.
   11. Sandstone.                       25.   Quartzy sandstone.

   13. Sandstone.
   14. Greenstore with carbonate of lime.

	This last mentioned stratum is at the depth of 47 fathoms. It
is 7 feet in thickness, and of excellent quality. Fibrous anthra-
cite may be noticed not unfrequently in the coal.
	Coal mines were worked in Torbolton parish so early as the year
1497.
	The Trap.--The coal district occupying the south-western por-
tion of the parish is separated from the red sandstone by a band or
dike of a very peculiar description of trap, which has been traced by
the writer from Meadow Bank, in Stair parish, across the parishes
of Torbolton and Craigie to the neighbourhood of Symington, a
distance of about eight miles. Offsets from this dike, forming ridges
