are carried on here with considerable spirit and success.  Several
branches are now established; but the most considerable are
carpets, inkle, cloth, and stockings.  The carpet manufacture
was established in the year 1752, and has, since that time, been
under the management of Mr. WILLIAM ROBERTSON, now a
partner.  For Some years, it was aided, by a bounty of 1 s. per
stone on all the wool manufactured, from the board of Trus-
tees for improvements in Scotland.  The present proprietors,
since the year 1780, besides Scotch carpets, have manufactured
several other articles in the woollen Line; such as serges for
carpet covers, plain cloths for table covers, ruggs, collar checks,
with other articles used by sadlers.  The quantity of wool
manufactured last year, was about 220 packs* of laid and white
wools.  Women are employed to spin there in their own
houses, receiving from the storehouse one stone at a time.  The
number of people, employed in the different branches of this
manufacture, last year, seems to have been 362.-The inkle
manufacture was begun in the year 1783.  The only branch
yet attempted is common linen tapes and twists.  In these
two articles, there are annually consumed 10 tons of linen
yarn; of which one half is spun at home, and, when the
price of flax is moderate, the whole of it.  The number of
people employed in spinning the flax cannot be ascertained, a
considerable quantity being sent to distant villages, at a time,
to a person appointed to give it out in small quantities.  The
other people employed may amount to 65.  This manufacture,
which is yet in its infancy, was likewise aided for a few years,
by the Board of Trustees for Improvements and Manufactures
in Scotland.-The stocking manufacture was established by
Mr. JOHN NIXON, in the year 1780.  For 4 years he was
employed chiefly in making hose, for people who furnished
