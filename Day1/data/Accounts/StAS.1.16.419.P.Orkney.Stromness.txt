bear yearly, without a change of crop, for 50 years.  No
pease or turnip are raised, but by the first residing heritor
already mentioned.  A small spot on each farm is planted
with potatoes, of which none were planted 50 years ago;
but they now constitute a principal part of food.

   Carts.-There were no carts here 50 years ago.  They
are now getting into use.  They are sometimes drawn by
a single horse, but more frequently by oxen.  The number
of carts is,

   Seed time and Harvest.-Oats are sown in March, and
the first of April.  Bear is usually sown from the 1st to
the 20th day of May.  The summer is employed in pre-
paring fuel, and carrying home peats.  The crop is reaped
from the 20th August, and if the season is favourable, har-
vest is done by the last of September or the first of Octo-
ber.  Hiems ignava colono is verified here, for there is no
labour carried on during winter, except thrashing and pre-
paring the crop.  Then it is that the farmer enjoys the
fruit of his labour, and to this season they look forward for
the reward of their toil.  They make malt, and as the ex-
cise is compounded, the greater part of them brew ale, and
drink it with one another alternately.  There is no doubt
but a great deal of the crop is consumed in this way; but if
used with moderation, it is what they are entitled to from
the labours of the year, and the season perhaps requires it.
Mirth and hilarity appear in a circle of neighbours met
thus to enjoy themselves during the rigour of the season,
and here the poet's description is realised:
