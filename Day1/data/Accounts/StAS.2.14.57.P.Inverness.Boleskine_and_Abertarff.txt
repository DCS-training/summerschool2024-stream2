ther suddenly. It is said that, on this spot, one of the
chieftains of the clan Cummin, so powerful in their day, while on
visit some of his dependents, fell sick and died.
  Modern Buildins.-The only buildings in the parish meriting
 the slightest notice are those of the garrison of Fort-Augustus. The
which this fort is built, and the farm connected with it,
were originally part of the Lovat estate, but were appropriated by
Government, in the year 1729, for the purpose of erecting a fortifi-
cation to overawe some clans who were inclinecd to disturb the peace
of the country, and to restore the forfeited and exiled family of
Stewart. The garrison is now become unnecessary and useless;
and Government some years ago ordered the ramparts to be dismantled,
and the ordnance to be sent to Fort-George.
