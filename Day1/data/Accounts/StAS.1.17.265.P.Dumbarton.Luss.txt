to have been buried in the church of Luss.  He was long
revered, therefore, as the tutelar saint of the parish*.  In
the church-yard there are some stone coffins of considerable
antiquity.  Each of them consists of one entire stone, with a
cavity cut out of it, fit for holding a dead body at its full
length, and a stone lid for covering it.  There is no inscrip-
tion upon either of them.

   Church+, etc.-The church is uncommonly good.  It was
built in 1771, by the late Sir James Colquhoun of Luss,
without laying any part of the burden upon the other heri-
tors.  The manse was built in 1740, is insufficient, and at
present in need of repair.  The living consists of 72 bolls of
oat-meal, at the rate of 8 1/2 stones per boll, 6 bolls of bear,
19 l. 12 s. 9 1/3 d. Sterling in money, and a good glebe.  There
is a process of augmentation at present depending.  Sir
James Colquhoun is patron of the parish.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The high veneration in which the memory of this saint
was held in early times, appears from a charter to John, Laird
of Luss, preserved in the chartulary of Lennox, which Robert,
King of Scotland, confirms in the 10th year of his reign:
   " Omnibus hoc scriptum visuris, vel audituris, Malcolmus
"Comes de Levenax, salotem in Christo.  Noveritis nos ob re-
"verentiam et honorem sanctissimi viri filn KESSOGI patroni
"nostri dedisse, concessisse et hac praesente.  Charta nostra con-
"firmasse dilecto et fideli Bachulario nostro Domino Joanne de
"Luss, et haeredibus suis quibuscunque talem libertatem, quod
"nos nec haeredes nostri prisas captiones seu carriagia infra
"terras suas de Luss, quas de nobis tenet haereditarie capiemus.
"Concessimus similiter,' etc.

+The church of Luss was one of the 6 churches within his
diocese, which, in 1429, John Cameron, bishop of Glasgow,
with the consent, and at the desire of their respective patrons,
erected into prebendaries.
