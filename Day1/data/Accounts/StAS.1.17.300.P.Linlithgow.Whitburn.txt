     Statistical Account

   Horses, Sheep, etc.-There are about 200 horses in the
parish, and but very few sheep, of late years, since the
grounds have been mostly inclosed and tilled.  A good ma-
ny horses and black cattle are bred for sale.

   Population.- The population of the parish is certainly in-
creased within these 40 years.  In 1755, it amounted to
1121 souls.  Last year, when a pretty exact account of the
numbers of the parish was-taken, they were found to be
1322 souls.  When the first calculation was made, there was
no village in the parish: At present there is a village, which
contains about 500 souls.  But the cot-houses, which were
formerly scattered through the parish, are now almost all
demolished, and those who possessed them have removed to
the village.  A person who has resided long in a public sta-
tion in the parish, remarks, that not above a third part of
the present heads of families are natives of the place.

   Extent of Farms.-There has been little alteration in the
extent of farms for the last 50 years.

   Births, Deaths, and Marriages.-The number of births
cannot be given with precision; but they are computed
about 30 yearly.  The burials are about 24 in the year; but
some bury in West-Calder, and some few in Livingston.-
The marriages are from 12 to 15 annually.  A great propor-
tion of them is irregular.

   Rent of the Parish.-The valued rent of the parish is
4244 L. 2 s. 11 d. Scots; the real rent is about 1800 L. or
2000 L. Sterling.  The rent of farms is in general from 7 s. 6 d.
to 20 s. per acre, according as they lie nearer to, or more remote
