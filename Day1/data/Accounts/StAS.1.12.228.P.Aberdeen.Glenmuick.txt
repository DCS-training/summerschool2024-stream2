     Statistical Account

tions have been made to find out the vein of the metal.  There
is plenty of lime-stone in this and the other two parishes; but
from the difficulty of getting fuel, there is not much of it
burnt.  The mountains in the 3 parishes are all covered with
heath, and the bottoms of many of them beautifully fringed
with natural wood and plantations.  Plots of natural birch,
oak, ash, alder, etc. are interspersed among the arable fields;
which, with the rivers, give the country a very pleasant ap-
pearance in summer.  The hills afford plenty of moor game,
particularly Morven, upon the highest grounds of which,
ptarmagans are always to be found*.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The most remarkable of the other wild creatures, are red and roe deer,
foxes, badgers, wild cats, polecats, martins, weasels, otters, white and grey
hares; eagles and lesser hawks; the black cock, wood cock, wood pecker, plo-
vers, partridges, etc. with a great variety of fighting birds.
   The charge is served by the minister, and a missionary minister, who has a
salary of 25 L. from the Committee on the Royal Bounty.  And, besides the 3
churches, there is another place of worship at the upper bridge of Gairn, where
the missionary is appointed by the Committee to preach every 2 d Sabbath; and
by these meansthere can be sermon but once in the 2 weeks in each of the places
of worship, which is very much complained of by the people.  But, as a cen-
trical church would remove this grievance, so no place can be better adapted
for one; for the 3 churches immediately form nearly an equilateral triangle of
2 miles each side; and if a large house should be built near the middle of this
angle, the bulk of the 3 parishes would be accommodated with sermon every
Sabbath, and the missionary would preach in the remote corners.  This plan
has been long in the view of the heritors; and, as 2 of the churches are going,
list into disrepair, it is to be hoped they will soon carry it into execution
