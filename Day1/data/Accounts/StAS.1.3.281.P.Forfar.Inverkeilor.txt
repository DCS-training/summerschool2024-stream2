from the sea.  The ague was formerly the most prevalent
distemper, but of late the rheumatism has become more ge-
neral.

   Rivers and Mills.-The river Lunan runs eastward through
this parish, and takes its rise, about four miles from the west
end of it, near Forfar.  This river has its source from a 
well, called Lunan Well, a little above a chain or lochs, viz.
Restener, Rescobie, and Balgaves, through which it passes, 
and in its course is fed by several burns.  It flows with a 
clear current, and after a variety of beautiful windings, falls
into the sea at Redeastle.  It formerly abounded with time
trouts, and some pike, but of late the fifh have suffered
much from watering lime in the river, or in burns that run
into it; and from fishing with nets.  In the course of this
river, through the parish, there are 15 mills, four of which
are corn, four barley, five lint, one flour, and one oil mill.

   Sea-coast.-The extent of sea-coast is about five miles, of
which, that along the bay of Lunan, (which affords a safe
anchorage for ships, except in a storm from the east), is flat
and sandy, and overgrown with bent; but the coast on the
south is high and rocky, where there is a remarkable pro-
montory, the Red-head, on the estate of the Earl of North-
elk, whose seat, Ethic-house, lies near it.  It was built by
Cardinal Beaton, and was one of his country seats.
cape is 45 sathomsand height, it is seen at a great distance
from sea, and abounds with a variety of sea-fowls.  At the
Red-head there is an inexhaustible quarry of fine free stone.
And below the rocks, pebbles, known by the name of Scots
pebbles, are numerous, among which there are some of the 
colour and density of an amethyst.
