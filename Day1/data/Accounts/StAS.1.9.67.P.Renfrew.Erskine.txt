   Population.-By the poll-book of the county of Ren-
frew, made up in the year 1695, there is reason to believe,
that the number of souls in this parish was at that time
considerably above 900.  By the returns to Dr Webster
in 1750, it was 829.  From lists taken up by the present
minister in 1771, the number of souls appeared to be about
870.  The year after that, a tract of land, which had been
let in small farms, and upon which 12 families resided,
was, at the expiration of the leases, converted wholly into
a grazing farm.  At present no more than 3 families live
in that tract in houses lately built, the old steadings having
been allowed to fall.  In the course of a few years after
that, 1 or 2 small farms, and some cottages, were suppres-
sed, by which the population was still farther diminished.
Since that time it has been pretty much stationary, and is
rather greater at present than it was 8 or 10 years ago.
-By an accurate enumeration, made in the beginning of
the year 1792, the numbers were as under:
