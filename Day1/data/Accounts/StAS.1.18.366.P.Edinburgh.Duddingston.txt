   Manufactures.-The manufacturing or weaving of cloths
of various kinds, though once prosecuted with considerable
success in this place, has fallen, as has already been remarked,
into a fatal decline.  Manufactures, however, of a different
kind, have arisen more recently with hopeful promise of suc-
cess in the eastern parts of the parish.  To the spirited and
continued exertions of one patriotic gentleman, are to be as-
cribed the various useful works which now occupy and adorn
the once desart lands of Figget, and which contribute to sup-
ply the village of Brickfield or Portobello with near 300 in-
habitants.  Mr William Jamieson, an eminent tradesman and
architect in the city of Edinburgh, having purchased about
40 acres of the Figget lands, at the yearly feu duty of L. 2: 2.

*Besides this, farmers servants receive two peeks of oatmeal a week,
and 6 d, which they call kitchen, which may render the whole expence
with other advantages, about L. 15: 12.
