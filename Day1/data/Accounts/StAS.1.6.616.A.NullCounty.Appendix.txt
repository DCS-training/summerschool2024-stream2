follies of the time; who disregarded the interests of society, or

   In 1790-Among the lower orders swearing had increased
greatly.-And on trials in the courts of law, perjury had also
increased.
   In 1791-Immoderate drinking, or pushing the bottle, as it
is called, was rather out of fashion among genteel people.-E-
very one was allowed to do as he pleased, in filling or drinking
his glass.  The means of hospitality and the frequency of shewing
it had increased;-and excess of such occasions had decreased.
   In 1763-In the best families in town, the education of
daugthers was sitted, not only to embellish and improve their
minds; but to accomplish them in the useful and necessary
arts of domestic economy.  The sewing school, the pastry-
school, were then essential branches of female education; nor
was a young lady of the best family ashamed to go to market
with her mother.
   In 1783-The daughters of many tradesmen consumed
the mornings at the toilet, or in strolling from shop to shop,
etc.  Many of them would have blushed to have been
seen in a market.  The cares of the family were devolved upon a
house-keeper; and the young lady employed those heavy hours
when she was disengaged from public or private amusements,
in improving her mind from the precious stores of a circulating
library;-and all, whether they had taste for it or not, were
taught music at a great expence.
   In 1791-There is little alteration.  Every rank is eager to
copy the manners and fashion of their superiors; and this has
in all ages been the case.  Of what importance, then, is
correct and exemplary manners in that higher ranks to the
good order of society!
