   Castle of Banff.-The Castle of Banff was a constabulary
of old, such as Cullen, Elgin, Fortes, and Nairn.  It was
a place of strength, and said to be occasionally the residence
of the King, when visiting this part of his dominions.  In
his Majesty's absence, it was the messuage of the thane,
sheriff, or constable, and the seat where justice was admin-
stered.
   By the public records it appears, that Walter de Leslie
obtained a charter, dated at Perth, 1364, of many lands,
among others, of Blairshinnoch in this parish, for furnishing
to the King a soldier to attend him, at three head courts:
"Apud Castrum de Banffe."  The office of sheriff continued
annexed to the castle till 1636, when the sherissdom was
resigned by the Earl of Buchan to Sir James Baird of the Archbi-
shop of St Andrew's.
   In 1683 Sir ----Sharp of Stonyhill disponed the Castle
of Banff to Provost Leslie of Kininvie, from whom the fa-
mily of Findlater afterwards derived their right of pro-
perty.

Lo, here interred, lies the presious dust of that renowned - Defaced.
Soul saving Seaton,
Preacher in this Town,
The Key of Knowledge,
And Glory of the Gown.                               Date desaced.

On John Andrew, town-clerk of Banff, anno 16-
Here lies a man whose Tongue and Pen
Did what they could to profit Men,
His life did prove most Christian,
So rests, to rise to Glore again.
