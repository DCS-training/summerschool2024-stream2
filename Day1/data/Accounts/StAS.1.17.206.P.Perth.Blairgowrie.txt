for every plough-gate, or 10 s. for every 100 l. Scotch of va-

   Gentlemen's Seats.-NEWTON-HOUSE, once the seat of
the proprietors of the Barony of Blair-Gowrie, and lately

Strathmore on the north, and has a most commanding view,
not only of Strathmore, but also of part of different counties.
-About half a mile farther west, lies the mansion-house of
the old family of the Blairs of Ardblair.  That family were

were miraculously saved in a vault of the old house, while it
was burnt down.
