die in the Highlands, than almost any where, particularly
since inoculation has been so universally practised; which it
has been, for a good many years back, to the saving of many
lives.

   In general, the people are pretty long lived.  Many are be-
tween 80 and 90;-some between 90 and 100; a few live be-
yond that age.  There is, at present, a gentleman, living,
and still healthy and strong, aged 103, who attended a fune-
ral the first year of this centry, and bore arms under the
Marquis of Atholl, the year before the Union.  We have al-
so a woman born the same year with him.  The present in-
cumbent likewise knew, about 30 years ago, one Donald Ca-
maron, who lived, it was credibly asserted, to the amazing
age of 127!
   The number of tenants is 354; of crofters 105; of cotta-
gers, 250; of men servants, 152; of maid servants, 289. A-
mong the cottagers are the handy-crafts-men, who serve the
country.

   The parish is, at least in some districts of it, greatly depo-
pulated, since the year 1754.  No less than 105 tenants have
been removed, and between 60 and 70 cottagers.  The com-
missioners, upon the lately annexed estates, began this, by let-
ting extensive farms, and others have followed the example.
Upon the whole, the population is said to have decreased by
some hundreds, since that time.  Some, but not many, have
emigrated to America.  The most of them have gone south-
ward to the towns.
   There are no Papists, Seceders, nor Jacobites, although the
latter were formerly numerous.  There are about a dozen of
Episcopalians.
   The people here live, a full half of the year, mostly upon po-
tatoes.  This root, with a little milk, butter, beef, or mut-
ton, which the tenants commonly have, makes excellent food.
