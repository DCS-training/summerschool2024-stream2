About that time, Mr Dunn purchased the Duntocher mill, which
had been used for spinning wool and flax and cotton yarn.  The
work was then unoccupied, and the village almost deserted. In
two or three years after, Mr Dunn purchased the Faifley mill from
the Faifley Spinning Company. This had been used for spinning
cotton, but on a small scale. He next purchased in 1813 the Dalnot-
ter Iron-Works, from Messrs Richard and Robert Dennistoun, which
had been occupied by them, as a mill for slitting and rolling iron,
and manufacturing implements of husbandry, nails, &c. At the
time Mr Dunn became proprietor of the works, the whole of the
men and women employed at them did not exceed 150.
   The Duntocher and Faifley mills were first greatly enlarged
The Milton mill, which was begun in 1821, was built on the site
of the Dalnotter Iron-Works, and after this a large addition was
made to the Faifley mill. The Hardgate mill was begun in 1831.
   These four establishments are exclusively employed in spinning
and weaving cotton.
   The machinery now in operation is as under: mule spindles,
66,820 ; throstle spindles, 7236 ; total spindles, 74,056 ; power-
looms, 530.
   The quantity of cotton spun per annum is about l,000,000 pounds
weight; and the yarn produced, which varies in fineness from No.12
to No 130, may be stated to be about 875,000. The cloths manu-
factured are of different fabrics from 9 to 20 reed, and vary in
breadth from 26 to 72 inches. The number of yards produced an-
nually, may be stated to be 2,000,000.
   The machinery till lately was driven by water power. There
were six water wheels of various dimensions employed; but there
has been erected a powerful steam engine at Faifley, and other
two are in progress at Milton and Duntocher, which will be in
operation in the course of the present summer, 1835.
   The number of persons employed in the spinning and weaving
departments, is upwards of 1400; 256 men, earning from 10s.
to 30s. per week; 626 women from 6s. to 10s.; 120 boys, four-
teen years and upwards, from 5s. to 8s.; 180 boys from Il to 14,
from 2s. 6d. to 5s.; 235 girls, from 2s. 6d. to 5s.; total number
employed 1417.
   As part of the produce of these works, Mr Dunn has acquired land-
ed property in the parish to the extent of about 2000 acres, nearly all
arable, and much of it as good land as any on the banks of the Clyde.
He possesses also about a fourth part of undivided moor, capable
