   The farmers in this parish are also well skilled in the ma-
nagement of black cattle, and breed great numbers of them.
They never attempt to raise them of a large size; but are
very attentive to the shapes both of ball and cow, and ac-
cordingly rear them very handsome.  It is a well known fact,
that in muir farms where the pasture is coarse, a small cow
will not only give as much milk, but even breed as good a
calf as one much larger.  By a little more attention to the
breed of horses, which they now begin to pay, they might
produce some of the hardiest and most serviceable for riding
or light carriage of any in Scotland.

   Manners, etc.-The inhabitants of this parish have not
been careless of their own improvement, and have made no in-
considerable progress in civilization.  Placed all in easy circum-
stances; enjoying not only the necessaries, but many of the
conveniencies, and some of the luxuries of life; favoured
with many intervals of leisure without enticements to dissipa-
tion, they have been careful to cultivate their minds; they
please themselves with rural or innocent social amusements,
of which they are extremely fond; and, upon the whole,
appear to be in that middle state betwixt opulence and want,
barbarity and refinement, which is perhaps of all others most
favourable to happiness.  Pride, envy, and ambition are, per-
haps, the most prevalent vices: Sobriety, industry, and hospi-
tallity the most distinguishing virtues.  The writer of this
has been surprised to find oftentimes in their little libraries,
some of the best authors in the English language.

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church and manse are
small, but in tolerable repair.  The stipend 500 l. Scotch,
