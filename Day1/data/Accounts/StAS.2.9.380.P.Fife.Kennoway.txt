village many new feus on ninety-nine years leases have been obtain-
ed and built on, principally along a new section of the line of road
leading this way from Kirkcaldy to Cupar :-and in other parts of
the parish, the number of dwelling-houses has been gradually en-
larged, chiefly in the same way.
The increase of population adverted to has been owing prin-
cipally, it is presumed, to the gradually improving condition of this
part of the country in general; and may, perhaps, be in some
measure assigned to the establishment and growing prosperity of
several manufactories in the near Deighbourhood. A number of
individuals fiDd constant work at Cameron Distillery, and the Haugh
spinning-mill, which are both in Markinch parish ; and the exten-
sive manufacture of linens carried on, by wealthy individuals and
companies, in most of the surroundilIg district, supplies the weavers,
of whom there are a great many here, with regular employment.
   The amount of population at each census, taken at different pe-
riods under the direction of Parliament, is as follows

               In the year 1801,       1466
                           1811,       1517
                           1821,       1649
                           1831,       1721 *

It is worthy of notice that, at the time of this last census, the
number of males exceeded that of females by 9 ; there being Of
the former 865, and of the latter 856.
   Of the population residing 10 villages, there were at the same
time in that of Kennoway, 862 ; in that of Star, 232 ; and in that
of Baneton, 125 ; inaking'in all 1219 ; and in the country there
were 502.

The average of baptisms for these last five years may be stated at	45
               deaths,                                                  29
               marriages,                                               14
The number of families in the parish at last census was,               409
The average number of individuals in each family was,                    4 1/2
Number of families chiefly employed in agriculture,                    110
                              trade, manufactures, or handicraft,      158
All others,                                                            141
Number of professional or other educated men is,                         7

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of              L.50
and upwards, is 10, Of Whom only three are at present resident in
the parish.

  * This number of 1721, ought to have been increased, we presume to think, by,
234, the amount of population on the lands of DaIguinch, &c., in the west end of
the parish, which are an annexation quoad sacra to Markincli. The census of popu-
lation by order (if Government is unquestionably a purely civil matter; and, there-
fore, the whole of the inhabitants ofth parish quoad ought to have been stated:
-the more especially as the population on the lands of Duniface, in Markinch Pa-
rish, which are an annexation quoad quoad aucra to Kennoway, was also included in the
Markinch lists.
