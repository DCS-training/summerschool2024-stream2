			IV.--INDUSTRY.
	Agriculture art Rural Economy.--The number of cultivated
acres in the parish is about 4000. The number of acres of waste
or uncultivated ground, consisting of plantations, moor, &c. may
be stated at 2000. The number of acres under wood may be
about 1000. The trees generally planted are, larch, spruce, plane,
beech, Scots fir, and oak. There is much more attention paid to
thinning, periodical felling, and judicious pruning, than formerly,
there being sales of wood about twice a-year.
	Rent of Land.--The average rent of arable land is L. 1. The
average grazing, for an ox or cow is L. 2.                                  -
	Husbandry.--The common breed of cattle is what is denomi-
nated the Angus, or black-cattle of the county, which, from the
Associations for the improvement of stock in this country, is rapidly
improving. The husbandry is that pursued in the most `gricul-
tural parts of the country. As the parish has been almost com-
pletely drained, and the farms almost all subdivided, and enclosed
by stone dikes or hedges, little is left for original improvement of
waste ground. Nineteen years form the duration of leaves.
