                                Brought over,          1772
April 1792. In the isle of North Ronaldshay the num-   
   ber of souls were                                    420

        Total number of souls in both islands,         2192

   By Mr M'Kenzie's map, the isle of Sanday contains 19
square miles, and, as there are 1772 persons in it, this is
93 5/19 persons to a square mile.  If the proportion of the
several parishes be wanted separately it is thus:
Crosskirk parish, 7 square miles and 579 persons, is 82 5/7 to
   a square mile.
Burness parish, 4 square miles and 390 persons, is 92 3/4 to a
   square mile.
Ladykirk parish, 8 square miles and 803 persons, is 100 3/8 to
   a square mile.
Isle of North Ronaldshay, 4 square miles and 420 persons,
   is 105 to a square mile.
   By this it appears, that the isle of North Ronaldshay has
the greatest number of persons to a square mile, which con-
firms the supposition usually made here, that this island is well
peopled for its extent.

   Subjoined is the number of Males and Females in the
charge of Crosskirk at two periods:

                                             Males.     Fem.
