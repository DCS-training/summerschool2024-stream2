of their education in the school of Dumbarton.  The elder,
whose name was James, was bred a soldier, and amongst his
acquaintance was distinguished for his address, and those ta-

Tobias.  A premature death, (he having perished at sea off

subject leads to description, or to the delineation of character,
his powers appear unrivailed.  To the greatest genius, he
