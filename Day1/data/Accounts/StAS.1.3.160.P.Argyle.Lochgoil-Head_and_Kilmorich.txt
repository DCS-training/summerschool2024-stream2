     UNITED PARISHES OF LOCHGOILHEAD
     AND KILMORICH.

     (Country of Arglye.)

     By the Rev. Mr DUGAL M'DOUGAL.

     Name.

   THE old name of this parish was Kil nam brathairn-
Kill, which, in the Gaelic language, signifies, a spot of
ground upon which a church or chapel was built.  The ground
within the chapel, and adjacent, was employed as a burying-
place, and usually dedicated to the memory of some favour-
ite saint.  Kil is supposed to be derived from the Latin cella;
brathair means a brother; and Kilnam brathairan, the house
and sacred ground of the brethren; from which it appears, that
Lochgoil-head was once the residence of some religious order
or fraternity; but no tradition exists with regard to the na-
ture of the establishment.  During the last 200 years, the
parish has been generally known by the name of Lochgoil-
head, from Lochgoil, an arm of the sea; at the head of which
the church is situated.

   History.-The parish of Lochgoil-head, of old, was very
extensive, and comprehended not only Kilmorich, but also
the greatest part of Kilmaglass, now called Strachur.  In the
times of Popery, and of Prelacy, Lochgoil-head was an arch-
deanery; and, not only the revenues of Lochgoil-head itself,
