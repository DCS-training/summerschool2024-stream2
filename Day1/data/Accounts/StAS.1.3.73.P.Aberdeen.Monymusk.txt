   Heritors.-The whole parish is the property of one heri-
tor, Sir Archibald Grant, grandson of Sir Francis Grant,
who was knighted by Queen Anne, and appointed one of 
the Senators of the College of Justice, by the title of Lord
Cullen.  That gentleman sold the estate of Cullen in 
Buchan, and purchased the whole lands of Monymusk from
the ancestors of the present Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo.

   Clergymen.-The parish is the charge of one clergyman.
There are no Seceders in it.  The inhabitants are all of the
established church, except twenty-eight Episcopal families,
and two persons who are Roman Catholics.

   Emigrations.-There are no emigrations from this part of
the country, except what may be occasioned by the casual re-
moval of tenants or servants, who are replaced by a greater 
or letter number as circumstances occur.

   Productions.-The produce is wheat, rye, oats, barley, and
pease; the quantity of wheat is much less considerable of
late years, than in the time of the late Sir Archibald Grant.
It is said that a wheat crop exhausts and improverishes the
soil more than any other grain.
