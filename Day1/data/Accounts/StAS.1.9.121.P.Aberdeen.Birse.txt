Dr. Ramsay's mortifications.  The number of scholars that
attend is, for the winter season, when the schoolmaster
teaches by or along with a depute, from 20 to 30 and up-
wards; during all the rest of the year none.  The place is
well situated for an academy, and might be made to turn to
much account to the master and the public.  The schools
of this parish have been in repute.  Every school will be

industrious, supporting themselves and family comfortably,
and seem in general contented with their lot.  At church,-
and at all public occasions, they are clean and decent; punctual

riages, and other merry meetings; so that often they have
not a great deal to begin with when they take up house,
notwithstanding their extravagant wages.  On these occa-
sions they often hurt their morals, and render themselves
unfit for the duties of their stations.  Both men and wo-
men are of the middling size; few men above 5 feet 10
inches; many of a lower stature, and these the ablest bo-
died.  They are shrewd and lively, slender and hardy;
differing considerably in their make from the people out
