   Extent, Situation, and Soil.-The parish is about 10 miles
long, from N. W. to S. E; and 4 miles broad, about the
middle, but much narrower towards the extremities.  It is one
of the most northern parishes in Scotland; and indeed the ex-
tremity of Dunnet Head, by the latest observations, is found to
be somewhat farther N. than even Duncansbay Head, or John
o' Groat's.  The foil is, in general, of a light nature, with little
stiff clay, or deep loam.  On the W. it is sandy, and towards
the E. it is chiefly a light black soil; but not without the ex-
ception of several farms, which are rich clay.  The far greater
part of the parish is uncultivated, and, indeed, a great part of
it unfit for cultivation.

   Dunnet Head.-DUNNET HEAD is an extensive promontory
on the W. It consists of several hills, but none of them of
considerable height, interspersed with vallies, in which there
is a great extent of pasture for small cattle or sheep.  It was
formerly well stored with the latter; which are said to have
succeeded well: But as these were destroyed by the introduc-
tion of a disease, it has, for many years past, turned to little
account to the neighbouring proprietors, who have it in com-
mon.  Dunnet Head presents very bold rocks, towards the
sea, from 100 to 400 feet high, through its whole circuit,
which is not less than 9 miles, exclusive of 2 miles of low
land, by which it is joined to the rest of the parish.  There is
no part of it inhabited.  The soil is chiefly moss, running on
free-stone, or sandy clay.  The free-stone, which is the only
kind of stone found there, is exceedingly hard, and seems to
be very little affected by the influence of the air, as appears
by the corner stones of a small steeple, adjoining the church,
which still bear the original marks of the iron, though it has
not stood, by the best accounts, less than 200 years.  Such an
extent of durable free-stone quarry, would, in some parts of
