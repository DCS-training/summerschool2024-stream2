must have been a large, if not an elegant building.  Parts, also,
of the garden walls are still standing, which suggest no mean idea
of the wealth of the clergy who inhabited it, and strongly mark
the pains they had taken, to secure the delicacies and luxuries
of the table.  Within these walls, and for a small space be-
yond them, on one side, the ground continues to be occupied
by fruit trees, which, having been long since planted, exhibit
appearances of decay, that, viewed in conjunction with the
mouldering fragments of structures, halt covered at top with
ivy, and surrounded at bottom with thorn and hazel, give an
air of melancholy grandeur to the place at large.  That

part of the church, or of the other buildings, which might
lead to the discovery of facts of such remote antiquity.  Upon
the whole, in viewing the abbey of Lindores, nothing is now
to be met with, worthy of attaching the curiosity of the visi-
