it could be ready for sowing; so that the acquisition of the
whole, computing it at a medium to be 1350 acres, would
sink a capital of nearly 20,000 l. sterling.
   One other method still remained; namely, to attempt let-
ting portions of the moss, as it lay, for a term of years suffi-
cient to indemnify tenants for the expences incurred in re-
moving it.  For some time both these plans were adopted;
but several reasons made the latter preferable.  1. The quan-
tity of water to be had was small; and being also uncertain,
it was very inconvenient for an undertaker; neither were
there any houses near the spot, which occasioned a great loss
of time in going and coming: but when a man should live
upon the spot, then he could be ready to seize every oppor-
tunity.  2. The moss was an useless waste.  To let it to te-
nants would increase the population of the estate, and afford
to a number of industrious people the means of making to
themselves a comfortable livelihood.
   In the mean time it was determined, till as many tenants
should be got as could occupy the whole water, to carry on
the work by means of undertakers.
   But before proceeding farther, it will be necessary to de-
scribe the manner of applying water to the purpose of float-
ing the moss.
   A stream of water sufficient to turn a common corn-mill
will carry off as much moss as 20 men can throw into it,
provided they be stationed at the distance of 100 yards from
each other.  The first step is to make, in the clay, along-
side of the moss, a drain to convey the water: and for this
operation the carse-clay below the moss is peculiarly favour-
able, being perfectly free from stones and all other extrane-
ous substances, and at the same time, when moist, slippery
as soap; so that not only is it easily dug, but its lubricity
greatly facilitates the progress of the water when loaded with
