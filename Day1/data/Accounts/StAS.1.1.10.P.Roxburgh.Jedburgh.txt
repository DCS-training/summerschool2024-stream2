sown in the ground immediately surrounding the town of 
Jedburgh, and some on Tiviot fide; but little or none in the
south part of the parish.  Turnips and potatoes are a gene-

particular, has been much studied, and is greatly extended;
every farmer laying out a great portion of his land in

able to the growth of turnips, than that of any other part of

oats have been much used of late, and are found to be a great
improvement.  The barley is sown from the middle of April
to the end of May:  The turnips from the beginning of June

tober. The wheat is generally sown after potatoes, or fal-
low; the barley, and grass feeds, after turnips; oats upon
ley, or after fallow, or pairing and burning. A greater quan-
