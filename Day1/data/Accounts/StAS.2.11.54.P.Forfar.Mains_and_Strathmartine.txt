	                MAINS AND STRATHMARTINE.

	    PRESBYTERY OF DUNDEE, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

	         THE REV. DAVID CANNAN, D. D. MINISTER.

        I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name, Boundaries, &c.-THE original name of Mains was Strath-
dighty; and no name could have been more descriptive, the parish
being in the form of a valley or strath, and the rivulet of Dighty
running through its whole length, and dividing it into nearly two
equal parts. It appears to have been afterwards called the Mains
of Fintry, the castle of that name being the principal object in the
parish. The church and manse adjoining were considered perti-
nents, and were designated accordingly. For a number of years
past, the parish has been called by the name of Mains.
	It is not very clear how the of Strathmartine came to be
applied to the other parish. There is an erect stone on the north
side of it called Martin's Stone; and there is a traditionary story
that this was erected in memory of a hero of the name of Mar-
tin, who killed a dr`gon which had devoured nine maidens. It is
probable that the whole parish derived its name from this person-
age, and was called Martin's Valley or Strath.
	The united parish is six miles long, and from one to three broad,
and contains about twelve square miles. A part of the parish of
Murroes is said to belong to it quoad sacra; but it is probable that
on other annexation took place than that the people preferred to
attend the church of Mains, as more convenient for them in respect
of distance than their own.
	The parish is bounded by Dundee on the south, Liff and Auch-
terhouse on the west, Tealing on the north, and Murroes and
Dundee on the east.
  Topographical Appearances.-The rising grounds on each side
are nearly all cultivated; they scarcely deserve the name of hills,
