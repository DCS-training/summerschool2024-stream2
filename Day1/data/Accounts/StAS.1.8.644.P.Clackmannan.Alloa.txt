education leads them to prefer that form of worship.  The
five clergymen, who are in town, live in the greatest harmony
and good intercourse with one another+.

   Schools and Donations.-There is a numerous and flourish-
ing school, conducted by a rector and doctor, (i. e. a mailer and
usher), both of whom have very good apartments.  The
rector takes boarders, and gives them every private assistance.
The pious Lady CHARLOTTE ERSKINE left 300 L.  Sterling for
educating poor children, and having them cathechised on Sun-
day evenings; which, according to the direction of Mr. ERS-
KINE, to whose care it was committed, has been begun, and
promises great success, under the direction of the doctor, who
assembles them, with all who choose to attend on the Sunday
evenings.  This meeting the ministers occasionally attend, and
mark the progress of the young, when the most diligent are
rewarded with little books.  Her Ladyship likewise bequeath-
ed 400 L. towards assisting the schools of the colliery.  The
charitable donations of this lady ought not to be omitted in
this place, though they are deeply engraven in the hearts of
many.  Children of all sects have access to the benefit of there
schools.  There are likewise several private schools, where some
of the younger and poorer scholars are educated.  In the village
of Tullibody, there is a numerous school, patronized by Gene-
ral ABERCROMBY.  In the colliery there are two schools, to
accommodate what are called the Upper and Lower Works, i. e.
the Collyland and Alloa.  All there schools are well attended,
and promise much public benefit.
