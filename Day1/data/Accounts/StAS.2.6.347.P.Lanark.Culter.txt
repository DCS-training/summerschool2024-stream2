	In 1831, the population of the united parish was 668. The
average number of births yearly for the last seven years, according
to the public register, is 9 1/3; but many are not registered. The
average number of deaths for the same period is 5 1/3; and of mar-
riages 5. The average number of children in a family is 4, if
we take account only of those families, where children actually re-
side; but if we include all the families in the parish the average
number of each family is 3. There is one fatuous person and one
blind; and seven proprietors of land whose respective properties
exceed the yearly sum of L. 50.

parish during the last three years. The writer would by no means
insinuate that this vice is peculiarly prevalent here. But it does pre-
