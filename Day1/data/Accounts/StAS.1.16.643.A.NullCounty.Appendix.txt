   Appendix, &c.         643
   
   The heritors having met after this enquiry was made
   and reported to them, Resolved, after having considered it,
   That as neither the walls nor roof of the present chruch are
   ruinous or insufficient, that there appears no necessity for
   pulling the church down at this time, and rebuilding it.
   This resolution was made, though it was understood that
   the town of Musselburgh was willing to be at two-thirds
   of the expence in rebuilding the church.
   
   N. B. It is proper to observe, in justice to this populous
   parish, that however wavering many of them may have
   been in their political opinions during the years 1792 and
   1793, it is certain, that no more than 30 joined those dan-
   gerous societies, who styled themselves Friends of the
   People.
   It is necessary to add, that there is a mistake in the
   Statistical Account, which states the revenue of the town
   of Musselburgh at L.1500, as it does not amount now to
   more than L.1200, having been reduced by the fall of the
   rent of their mills.
