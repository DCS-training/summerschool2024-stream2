     Statistical Account

The name of the country, from Dunkeld to the marches of
Badenoch, towards Dalchuiny, Atholl (or Adh-oll), is evi-
dently from this sours.  Adh signifies happiness, or plea-
santness, and oll, great; great pleasantness.  The Grampian
mountains, too, appear to be so called, from the Gram-
pla, still retained by the Cornish, as well as by the French,
grimper, to climb, or mount; but it more probably comes from
gruaim, gloominess, and beinn, a mountain, on account of
the clouds that cover them.  Beinn-glo, the Mountain with
the Vail, to wit, of Clouds and Snow :  Beinn-deirg, the Red
Mountain, on account of the red granite in it;-Beinn-vu-
rich, the Hill of roaring or rutting; and Drumuachelar, the superi-
or ridge,-are all equally expressive of their origin.-The
names of the rivers, too, are from the same language.  Gar-
ry (Gath-ruith), the slight of the Dart, because of its rapidity.
Tummel (Taivil), shadowy, obscure, from its woody and rocky
banks.  Erochty, from eirigh, to rise, and ath, a river; or ra-
ther from oireachdas, enreachdas, an assembly; this being a cen-
trical, and yet a retired place, where forces might be collect-
ed for an expidition; (which use, Duncan Ravar, the chief
of the Robertsons, is known to have made of it, in the time
of the two Bruces;) or to secure women, children, and valu-
able effects, from the enemy.  In support of this, in the head
of Glenerochty, is Trinafuir, or Tir-a-vuir, the third, or the
land of the wall or castle; and Dail-nan-fonnoch, the Plain of
Palisades, or Stocades.  Bruir (Bru-vir) noisy Water.  Tilt,
(Teilt) Te-alt, the Warm Rivulet, from its sheltered warm
banks.  Gairnog, the Little noisy Stream.  Banvy, the Rivu-
let of the Boar, or rather, that lays land waste.  Coille-chrioth-

probably because they first moved to the westward, when the face
of the earth was all covered with wood.
