     Statistical Account

   Church, School, and Poor.-The church was partly rebuilt
in 1771, and is in good condition, but is ill contrived for
the intended purpose, and too small for the congregation.
Those of the Scotch Episcopal persuasion have a small meet-
ing house for public worship.  The manse was built about
70 years ago, and has been three times repaired.  The sti-
pend was augmented last year, and is now 56 bolls of meal,
32 bolls of bear, and 43 L. 17 s. 10 1/2 d. in money, including
5 L. for communion elements.  The glebe is a little above the
legal size.  Mrs. Helen Milne Nicolson of Glenbervy is pa-
tron.  There is a parochial schoolmaster, a new school-house,
and a dwelling-house for the master.  The school fees, for
teaching English and writing, are 1 s. 6 d.; for arithmetic,
2 s.; and, for Latin, 2 s. 6 d.  The number of scholars are
about 40, at a medium.  The salary is about 200 merks
Scotch.  The number of weekly pensioners may be reckoned,
at an average, about 5 or 6, besides many others, who receive
occasional, and often considerable supply.  The fund for their
support and relief arises from the interest of 236 L.  Sterling,
saved mostly out of former collections, the weekly collec-
tions on Sunday (about 8 s. at an average), mortcloths, pro-
clamation money, and the rents of a few seats in the
church.

   Horses, Sheep, etc.-There are about 161 draught horses,
which may be valued at 12 L.  Sterling each, one with another,
and a considerable number of black cattle, but few sheep, in
comparison of the number that might be reared, and kept on
the hills belonging to the parish.  Mr. Duff of Fetteresso
has a small estate in this parish, called Morgie, that would
maintain 1500 black-faced sheep, which, when fully fed, would
sell at 1 L., 5 s. each.  Perhaps the new mode of farming is
