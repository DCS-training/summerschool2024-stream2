     Statistical Account

tity of human bones, which evidently have been burnt:
Parts of the skulls, and other human bones, are very dis-
tinct.  They were carelessly left by the workmen who
found them upon the publick road, where some idle boys
broke them in pieces; but, from the information that
could be got, and fragments that were picked up, no in-
scription had been upon them.  It is remarkable, that
wherever one of these cairns is met with, another will
invariably be found within view of it.  A line of them,
in this parish, can, in this way, be traced for 2 miles.
There may be two, and not a third one in view of either;
but there is never one without another, unless it has been
carried away, within view of its fellow.
   There is, in this parish, a spring of the chalybeate kind,
which has been used with success in scorbutic disorders.
