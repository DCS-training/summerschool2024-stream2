men, for navigating the rivers Forth, Devon, and Goodie,
which are printed, and now in the hands of the public; and
to which report are added several proposals tending to lessen
greatly the expence of the navigation, and also the putting
sooner into possession of the advantage that is hoped to re-
sult from the execution of these works:-
     Resolved,
   I.  That the rendering of the rivers Forth, Devon and Goo-
die navigable, is a measure very expedient for the advance-
ment of trade in general, as well as for the improvement of
the countries adjacent to the said rivers in particular.
     Resolved,
   II.  That it is the opinion of the meeting, that the changes
proposed to be made upon the former printed plans and esti-
mates, will greatly lessen the expence and abridge the time
necessary for compleating the intended navigation.
     Resolved,
   III.  That they have now before them sufficient evidence
of the probability of the said measure to be the ground of an
application to Parliament, to obtain an act for the above pur-
pose as soon as may be.
     Resolved,
   IV.  That it has been represented to the meeting, that it
is very difficult to obtain an act of Parliament unless two
thirds of the necessary expence are provided for:-That it
be recommended from the chair to the gentlemen composing
the meeting, to white to their friends and acquaintances,
who, either by the situation of their several estates, or from
other causes, are materially interested in the success of this
navigation, to know from them what sums they are willing
to subscribe, in order to carry those abridged plans into exe-
cution, and facilitate the passing of the intended bill into a
law.
