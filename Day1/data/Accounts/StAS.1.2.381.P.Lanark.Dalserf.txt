guishes charity in those who give, as they give from compul-
sion, and prevents gratitude in those who receive, since they
receive it as a right.  The poors-rates are now severely felt in
England, and every method ought to be taken to prevent their
becoming so burdensome in Scotland, which is so much less
able to aford it.

   School-No house has hitherto been built in this parish, for
a school-house; but the established school-master has a salary
of 200 merks Scots, besides the perquisites he enjoys, as pre-
centor, session-dock, and collector of poors-rates.  He is qua-
lified to teach English, Latin, writing, arithmetic and book-
keeping.  The scholars are from 40 to 60 in number; the
school wages are, for English, 1s 6d. per quarter; for writ-
ing, arithmetic, and Latin, 25 6d. per quarter.
   Parish schools, with teachers properly qualified, are of
great importance, and ought to be encouraged, by giving suf-
ficient appoinments.  In those parihes, where, from the
smallnest of the encouragement, only ignorant, low-minded
school masters, unfit to teach anything but a poor smattering, can
be had, the children of the peasantry are doomed to perpetual
ignorance and obscurity.  But in places, where there are
teachers, liberally educated, and capable of instructing youth
in the important parts of education, persons of the lowest birth
have risen to eminence and rank.

   Minerals.-Coal is found here in great abundance, there
being no less than 4 coal works in the parish, two on the
west, from which a great part of the town of Hamilton is sup-
plied; one in the center of the parish, and one upon the
south.  Coal sells at the pit, at from 2s. to 2s 6d per ton.-
Lime has only been found in one place, viz. in the lands of
Broomhill; none of which is sold, as the proprietor retains it
