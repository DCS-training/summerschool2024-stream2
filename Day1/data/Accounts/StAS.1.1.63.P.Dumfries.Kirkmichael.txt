   Antiquities.-There are several indistruct remains of an-
cient fortifications, but no traditions about any other than
a small fort in the Knock Wood, called Wallace's House,
said to have been thrown up by Sir William Wallace, after
he had slain Sir Hugh of Moreland and five of his men, at
a place still named, from that event, the sax corses, i. e. the
six corpses; and where there are two or three large stones,
which seem to have been set up in remembrance of some such
transaction.

   There are some small tumuli, or cairns; but none of them
have been opened, nor have their contents been examined.

   There are several barrows, or burrans, as they are called
here.  They seem to have been intended for folding cattle
at night:  And it is observable, that, when one of these bar-
rows is on one farm, there is always one opposite to, and
within call of it, upon another.  This has probably been done
with an intention, that, in case of any inroad from the Eng-
lish Border, whoever of the herds or keepers first observed
the enemy, might give notice to, and be ready to assists, the
other, either to defend, or carry off the cattle to places of
greater safely.

   The only Roman works in the parish are, a branch of
the great road that led from Netherby in Cumberland to the
chain of forts built by Lollius Urbicus, between the Forth
and the Clyde, that can still be traced through a moss, and
seems to have terminated at a castellum, which is now the
minister's garden, and of which two sides remain still very 
distinct.
