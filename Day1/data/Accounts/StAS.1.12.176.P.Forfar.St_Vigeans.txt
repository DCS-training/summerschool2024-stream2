stituted in 1787, and governed by a preses and counsellors;
chosen annually.  This society consists at present of 87 mem-
bers, all weavers; and they admit none but those who have
been regularly bred to the business.  The preses buys from
800 to 1000 bolls of meal yearly, and from 400 to 500 bolls
of coals, all which is given out to the members at 3 or 4
months credit; this society affords 2 s. a-weak to their poor,
which is paid out of the general fund; and when the fund
happens to be reduced to a certain sum, their poor are sup-

led the Townhead Society, is managed in much the same man-

at a cheap rate, by laying in large quantities at proper seasons;
and they find ample credit, by the whole members being
bound for the payment.  The members of both societies show
particular attention to the moral character of the persons they
admit.

remarkably industrious; by which means the most part of
them are enabled to live comfortably.  By their residence in
the vicinity of Arbroath, where manufactures are carried on
to a very great extent, they enjoy every advantage for know-
ing the goodness and value of the materials they make use of,
the method by which they may be best manufactured, the cha-
racter of the merchants with whom they deal, and when to
embrace the fittest opportunity for disposing of their goods.
