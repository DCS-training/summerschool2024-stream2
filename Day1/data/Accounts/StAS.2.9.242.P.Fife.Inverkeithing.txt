and a grain stock-market, all of most handsome appearance, and a
curious and rather lofty stone pillar at the cross; also a town-house,
and a Meeting-house belonging to the United Associate Synod.
There is a building intended for a Lazarette between Inverkeithing
and the Ferry, which, however, had been little used for a dozen of
years past, and was sold last year by Government for a trifling sum,
having a heavy feu-duty upon it,-the frigate Dartmouth, stationed
in St Margaret's Hope, being now employed for the quarantine
service in its stead. The buildings in this neighbourhood are of
white sandstone or greenstone.

According to the return made to Dr Webster this was in         1755,   1694
By an accurate private list made in            .          .    1793,    2210
By the Government census     .   .                             1801,    2228
                                                               1811,   2400

   Of this last return, 1569 are males, and 1620 females,
   The number residing in the burgh is 2020, being 978 males,
and 1042 females; in the village of North Ferry, 434, being 203
males, and 231 females; in that of Hillend, 279, being 146 males,
and 133 females; and in the country part of the parish, 458, be-
ing 243 males, and 215 females.
   The increase in the number of parishioners between 1821 and
1831 is 677. This great increase may be partly accounted for
by the establishment of a large distillery between these periods,
but it arose principally from a large influx of labourers employed
about 1831, to work in the greenstone quarries supplying materi-
als for the extension of Leith pier, and the erection of the new
bridge at Stirling. These quarries being abandoned upon the com-
pletion of the works, the labourers and their families have gone
elsewhere, and it is supposed that the population is not now so nu-
merous as in 1831.
   The number of families was in 1831, 712, of inhabited houses
438, and of other houses, 12. The average number of a family
nearly 4 1/2.
   There are two persons only of independent fortune residing in
the parish, and one of them is but a very small proprietor in it.
There are no noblemen resident, and but one of the larger heri-
tors. The proprietors of lands in the parish of more than L.50
rental, are 11 in number.
