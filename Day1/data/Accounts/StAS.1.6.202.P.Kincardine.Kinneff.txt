gin to be exhausted by crops of grain, the farmers may
think of cultivating the breed of this very useful and profitable
animal; and the moors will then become useful by supplying
them with heath and whins.

   Contents, Cultivation, etc.-From an accurate survey and
exact map of the county, published in the year 1774 by Mr
William Garden, it appears that the parish contains 5043
Scotch, or 6408 English acres.  Perhaps about one-half, or
rather nearly two thirds are arable.
   It has been already observed, that the parish may be divided
into coast-side and upper lands.  The present post road near-
ly forms the line of this partition These two divisions are not
so different in soil as they are in situation and climate.  The mode
of cultivation may therefore be nearly the same, but the pro-
duce is different.  It may also be proper to remark, that the si-
tuation, from being extended along the coast, affords easy access
to lime brought by sea.  The farmers find no difficulty in getting
small barks to run a-shore on the beach, at two or three places
where there is access for carts; and, by these means, get
as much lime as is necessary at a short distance from their land.
Of this manure they have at length learned to make the pro-
per use.  They fallow, clean, level, straighten, and drain their
fields, and then put lime on them in proportion to the qua-
lity of the soil.-To strong land, they give from 40 to 70
boils of lime shells to the Scotch acre, which boll contains
32 Scotch pints to the sirlot; and, to land that is lighter, from
from 30 to 40 bolls per acre are allowed-To the strong land
in the neighbourhood of the coast thus managed, the farmer
adds from 40 to 50 cart loads of dung to the acre.  He then lays
it down with wheat: his second crop is hoed beans or turnips;
and his third barley or bear, and grass feeds.  The high lands
