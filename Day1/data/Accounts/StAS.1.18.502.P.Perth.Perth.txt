stakes, and also a manger, wholly and very neatly wrought
of the twigs of trees; a kind of work which was much prac-
tised by the ancient Britons.
   According to the course of natural causes, the bed of the
river must also have been considerably raised.  An old reve-
rend gentleman, who died a few years ago, in a manuscript
history of his parish, in which are some high mountains,
wrote as follows:
   "The soil washed away by the heavy rains is carried
"down from the high mountains into the streams and ri-
"vers, and by them into the sea; where it subsides, and
"gaining on the sea has made our Carses of Gowrie, Stir-
"ling, and Falkirk.  In proof of which, some persons dig-
"ging for coals in the Carse of Falkirk, found a complete
"boat in the clay, 5 fathoms deep; and some other persons,
"digging for a draw-well in Perth, found at 3 fathoms below
"the level of the bottom of the river Tay, tripods or chairs,
"and some other pieces of household furniture."
   Walter Goodall, in his edition of Fordun's Scoti-Chronicon,
in the year 1759, thought it necessary, for the vindication of
the antiquities of Perth, to subjoin to the account which For-
dun gives, (vol. i. p. 528.) an annotation from a Latin manu-
script in the College of Edinburgh.  Of a part of which the
following is a translation.
   "The author, viz. Fordun, plainly relates there things
"concerning one and the same city.  But Hector Boece,
"and George Buchanan his follower, tell a fabulous story
"of an ancient city Bertha, which from thenceforth was
"entirely deserted; and of another, and new city, built in
"another place, by King William, and which was called
"Perth, from a noble person of that name, who contributed
"his lands to the building of the town."
