 the remaining two, Jonathan Waldie' administered: by the bailie
 and minister; and leadbetter's, administered by the niinirters of
 all denominations, yield- at present an annual interest of I.., 18.

 The items are as under:

   4. To these various fixed* sources of relief must be added the sums
 supplied by the public + bounty of individuals, which, though ne-
 cessarily varying in amount in different years, cannot be rated at a
 lower average than L. 100. + These donations are generally given,
 in whole or in part, in coals, meal, &c, and are administered by va-
 rious persons, according to the appointment of the donors.
    Putting together all the above-mentioned resourbes, the anntal
 amount applicable to the wants of the poor in the parish cannot be
 estimated much below L.1300; a sum greatly exceeding what is
 expended for the same purpose in most Scottish parishes of 5000
 population.  Yet it must be remembered that the peculiar cir-
 cumstiinces of Kelso, if they do not vindicate, sufficiently explain
 such an expenditure. Irrespective of its  vicinity to Fngland,
 which brings to bear upon it the ill example of an excessive poor-
 rate, its situation, as the metropolis of a wide rural district, neces-
 sarily exposes it to a constant influx of indigent persons, by making
 it the resort, in their declining years, of infirm labourers as well as
 of widows and sickly females, who, after a few years residences,
 frequently come in for a share of its charities and even of its pen-
 sions. The largeness, too, of the provision, for the poor, taken in


    Under the head of fixed supplies ought perhaps to be included a corporation
 fund, averaging about L. 18 yearly, which arises from the fees of entrants, &c. This
 fund is divided annually, at the discretion of the office-bearers of the corporations,
 among poor members, or the indigent families of deceased members.
    + This term is employed to distinguish the donations in question from private
 charity, which of course cannot be included in the present account.
    + During the unusually severe winter of 1836-7, the class of donations referred
   to more than doubled this sum, as the following list will show;
             Duke of Roxburghe's donation, (4 oxcn,)      -           L. 60
             Duchess Harriet,       -      in coals,          -          25
             Sir Charles Dalbiac,       -              -                 50
             Mrs Shedden.   -               in meal.          -          40
             James Nisbet, Esq.      -            -               -      21
