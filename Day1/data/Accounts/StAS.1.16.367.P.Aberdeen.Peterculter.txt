kinds.  A part of Oldfold and Murtle is likewise planted.
In all of them there is game, as in the plantations of Bingle,
and various singing birds, the thrush, linnet, goldfinch, etc.
In severe winters woodcocks are numerous in the woods
of Culter.  I have heard a sportsman say, that he has, in
one day, killed 7 or 8 of them.-As plantations have in-
creased, sheep have decreased.  There were 7 farms in the
lands of Culter and Murtle, on each of which there was a
flock of sheep, and now a single animal of the kind is not
to be seen on any of them.
   There are in the parish, of one kind or other, 132 hor-
ses, 79 carts, about 1000 black cattle, 49 ploughs, 2380
sheep.  All the horses, except about 20, are of a small size;
and the black cattle and sheep are generally of a small breed.
   The rent of some of Mr Gordon's property is L. 3 an acre,
of some L. I, 10 s. and of some a guinea.  Of Mr Watson's
property, only a few acres are let to tenants, who pay a
guinea per acre.  In the lands of Countesswells, the rent of
an acre of arable land, is, I believe, in general a guinea.
Some of the inclosures in grass, being only 3 or 4 miles
from Aberdeen, let at more.  In the estate of Culter, the
rent of an acre of infield* may be 10 s. 15 s. or 20 s.;
that of an acre of outfield, 2 s. 6 d. or 1 s.; one would think
some of it dear at 1 s.  The crop many times will not
compensate the expence, and they own it; but they
say, that they till it to renew the grass; poor too is that
grass.  The valued rent of the parish is L. 2163: 9: 8
Scots, or L. 180: 5: 9 3/4 Sterling.  The real rent is above
L. 1200 Sterling; and there are 3 salmon-fishings belonging
to the lands of Culter and Kenarty, whose rents amount to
L. 50 Sterling, or upwards.

*The infield bears a small proportion to the outfield, and hill and
pasture.
