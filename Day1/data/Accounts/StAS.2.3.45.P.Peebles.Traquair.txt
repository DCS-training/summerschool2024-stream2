                            III.--POPULATION.
    The population of this parish in ancient times must have been
much greater than at present, as the sites of several villages, on
which not a vestige of a house now remains, are still pointed out.
In the records of the presbytery of Peebles, too, under date the
5th August 1674, the number of communicants in the several pa-
rishes of the resbutery is mentioned as the proportion by which
these parishes were to contribute to the support of a bursar.                                    In
this record, Traquair is said to have bad 360, and Kailzie, 100 ;
two-thirds of which latter number now falling to be added to Tra-
quair, would make the number of communicants in this parish about
430, whereas now they do not amount to one-half of this number.
Even deducting, then, for the number who have dissented from
the church since those days, the population must have been not
much less than double of what it is now.  It has again, however,
increased considerably since the date of the last Statistical Account,
if there was no mistake in the enumeration there given,--partly
owing to the regular residence of the families of Traquair and
Kalizie, but principally to the universal introduction of the turnip
husbandry.  The following table will show the amount of the po-
pulation at difference times, as nearly as can be made up:

                In 1674,        -         1000
                In 1755,        -          651
                In 1794,        -          446
                In 1801,        -          613
                In 1811,        -          621
                1n 1821,        -          643
                In 1831,        -          629

     In this parish, there is scarcely any thing deserving the name
of a village.  Excepting about twenty families of tradesmen and
labourers, several of whom are bound to keep "bondagers" for
their houses, the population is wholly rural, and live around the
farm-steadings to which they are respectively attached.
     For the last seven years, the yearly average of births does not
exceed 20; of deaths, 9 ; and of marriages, 6 individuals.
     The number of families in the parish is 108, whereof 68 are
chiefly employed in agriculture, and 20 in trade, manufactures, and
handicrafts.
     There are no blind, (leaf, or dumb persons in the parish ; 1
idiot; 1 slightly fituots ; and 1 or 2 that may be termed insane.

official return the names of 14 persons were only residents at the
time, and not parishioners.
