   Wages.-For some years after the first printfield was erect-
ed, the business was conducted upon a small scale, and that
part of it, which is properly called the printing, was almost

at the rate of 3 s per week for the first 3 years, and 4 s. for

may be said to earn 14 s. per month, at an average.  The
greater part of the women are employed in pencilling.  A
great variety of colours cannot be put upon the printed cloth
without the assistance of the pencil.  The boys and girls
have, in general, 6 s. 8 d. per month; a very few of them

   Formerly, the operative manufacturers were employed by
their masters at day's wages; but the masters, for sometime
past, have found it their interest to give so much money for
the piece of work and to leave it to the operative hands to
do much or little as they choose.  As soon as the trade came
to be put upon this footing, some of the operative people
