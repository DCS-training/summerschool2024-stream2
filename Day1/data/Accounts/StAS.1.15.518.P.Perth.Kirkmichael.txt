doubtful cases.+  This stone is placed on the plain surface
of a rock level with the ground.  Its shape is quadrangular
approaching to the figure of a rhombus, of which the great-
er diagonal is 7 feet, and the lesser 5 feet.  Its mean thick-
ness is about 2 1/2 feet.  Its solid contents will therefore be
about 51,075 cubical feet.  As it is of very hard and solid
whinstone, its weight, reckoning the cubical foot at 8 stones
3 pounds,+ may be reckoned to be 418 stone 5 pounds, or
within 30 pounds of 3 tons.  It touches the rock on which
it rests only in one line, which is in the same plane with the
lesser diagonal, and its lower surface is convex toward the
extremities of the greater diagonal.  By pressing down ei-
ther of the extreme corners, and withdrawing the pressure,
alternately, a rocking motion is produced, which may be en-

     Of him whose breaft is pure; but to a traitor
     Tho' even a giant's prowess nerv'd his arm
     It stands as fix'd as Snowdon. CARACTACUS.

   It is supposed, with much appearance of reason, that this ordeal, though
it appeared in the eyes of the vulgar to be an appeal to the judgment of the
Supreme Being, was in fact subservient to the designs of the Draidical priest
who conducted it; and that by some expedient, they contrived to make the
issue of the trial correspond either to the judgment which they had previous-
ly formed of the case, or to their designs regarding the culprit.

+A stone of the same quality with the rocking stone, was gauged and
weighed, and found to weigh at the rate of stone, 3 lib. the cubic foot.
