to have the leases extended, were it not for the freindly understand-
ing that subsists betwixt them, and which enables the latter to look
forward with confidence to a renewal of his lease. It is not uncom-
mon for several successive generations of the same family to occupy
the same farm. Within the last twoo or three years most of the farms
in the parish were re-let and such is the activity with which the
occupants commenced improving them, that, if the spirit at pre-
sent manifested does not relax, a few years more will bring under
cultivation every inch of waste land worth the reclaiming.
   Fishieries.-Salmon are caught in the Tummel and Garry, but
not nearly in such abundance as at former periods. The rent is
about L. 20.
   Raw Produce.-The following is the average gross amount of
raw produce raised in the parish, as nearly as that can be ascer-
tained;

   It will be observed that the third only horses are stated
as pastured in the parish, A few summered in the park in the
neibouring parishes, and the rest may be said to be fed on hay,
straw, the refuse of distilleries, clover, and vethces. It may be
remarked also that the above averages may strike many as too low,
and that is certainly the case in regard to the How of Moulin,
and L. 25 and upwards.
   Manufactures.-Previous to the passing of the Distilery Act.
