barley, bear and sometimes of beans, a greater quantity is
raised in this parish than what is necessary for the support
of the inhabitants.  These are generally sold to the bakers
and brewers in the towns upon the coast side, or to persons
residing there, who are commissioned by such, in Edin-

fatted cattle are commonly bought by the butchers from

which have brought a number of persons, and their families
