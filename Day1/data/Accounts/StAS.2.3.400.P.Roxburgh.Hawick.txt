   Agriculture.-Great progress has been made of late years in the
department Of agriculture, and this probably will appear sufficient-
ly obvious by the statement of a few facts : 1. A considerable
extent of waste land belonging to the town of Hawick has either
been planted or brought into cultivation, while, on many of the
farms, similar improvements have been effected, though on a smal-
ler scale, with respect to land formerly in pasture. 2. Drains to
a great extent have been made in the sheep pastures, and nume-
rous stells have been erected for the shelter of the stock. 3. Much
attention has been paid to the improvement of the breeds of cat-
tle and of sheep, and lately with great success, the cattle at the
Hawick  market being now considered equal to those shown at any
other market for the same kind of stock in the county. 4. The
Scotch plough is entirely laid aside, while the most approved im-
plements of modern invention are now in general use. 5. The
number of carts brought into the town on any ordinary market-day
amounts generally to about 170, although it is within recollection
of some of the oldest inhabitants, when there was only one cart,
the property of the minister, in thd whole parish.
   The subjoined tables have reference to the state of agriculture
in the parish at present.  To Mr Elliot of Goldielands we are
mainly indebted for the particulars they contain.
