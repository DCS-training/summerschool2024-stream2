duly prized or improven, for there are still upwards of 1000
acres of land in the parish, which, from both soil and climate,
is highly capable of cultivation, at present lying in a state of
nature, covered with heath, and almost good for nothing.
The fault here rests almost wholly with the landlords, who
in that respect are in a great measure blind to their own inte-
rest; for where the means of improvement is got at so cheap
a rate, and the distance not great to carry it, a little calcula-
tion might serve to demonstrate, that on nothing could they
lay out their money to so much advantage; but where a te-
nant has only a lease for nineteen years, and perhaps his en-
couragement not great otherwise, it cannot be expected that
he should lay out much money in the enclosing and cultiva-
tion of barren land*.  From the above hint, it is not intend-
ed to throw any imputation of sloth or inactivity upon ei-
ther landlord or tenant, (but only to show that a great deal
more might still be done;) for there are several farms which
now pay five times as much rent as they did thirty years a-
go, and the tenants still able to live much better now that
they did then.  There are in the parish 76 carts, six of
which are kept for hire, and the rest for the purposes of farm-
ing; and 63 plows, some of the English, and some of the old

<FOOTNOTE>

*The writer of the above having a good deal of experience in the im-
provement of barren heathy land, would recommend the following plan
where such land has a mossy surface, and of a very still benty soil.  Instead
of fallowing, which is the common practice, and which is attended with a
great deal of labour and expence, plow up the land in winter or spring; the
summer following give it a slight harrowing, to prevent the manure falling
down between the furrows, after which spread the manure upon it, and so
let it ly for at least one year, or, if the soil is very stiff, two years, before
you put a plough in it.  You will then find, that the surface is quite rotten,
and that the land is fit for a crop of oats, turnips, etc.; and that by giving
it time to ly till the surface rot, it does more than even fallowing could do
to such land, and the expence nothing.
