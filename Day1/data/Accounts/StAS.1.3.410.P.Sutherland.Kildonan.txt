other on the opposite side.  They are covered at the top
with large flags, above a trench of 3 feet broad, and 5 or 6
feet high.  From their construction and direction, they seem

effects and cattle, from the pursuit of invading enemies, in
troublesome times; or sally ports, for facilitating their escape
from a victorious enemy.  Monsieur du Moulin mentions, in
his history, that the Albigenses often made good their escape
from their bloody enemies, who besieged them, by a subster-

was 6 miles in length.  There are upwards of 9 Pictish

   Inundations.-In Breinchoel, a shieling or grazing in this
parish, happened the fall of a dreadful water spout about 40
years ago.  The Bowman, with his family, and the produce
of the dairy, were all carried away in one heap, in the hut
or booth where they slept that night, and were found dead
after the flood was over.  The course, which the tremendous
stream marked out, may be computed at 60 or 80 feet deep,
which appears like an awful cavern, whence large pieces of
solid moss, and trunks of trees were driven down to the
plain at the foot of the hill.  About 14 years ago, a similar
