  Poor.-The average number of persons receiving parochial aid
is about 15. Of this number some have families. There is sel-
dom less fiven to any pauper than 1s., and seldom more to any
than 2s. 6d. per week, unless in the case of widows with young
families, or of orphan children. Donations are occasionally given
in a private manner to meritorious persons known to be in distres-
sed circumstances, and who may have a reluctance openly to ap-
ply for relief. Such persons seldom fail to evince gratitude for
the respect shown to their wants. A pauper has been for about
twenty years past in the Dundee Lunatic Asylum. The annual
average of collections, contributions, &c. on behoof of the poor for
the three years preceding 1st. July 1841 was L.72, 14s. 7d.; dis-
tributed, L.64, 8s. 1d.; to which is to be added expenditure for
salaries of kirk-officer, session-clerk, and precentor, &c. L.8, 15s.
9d. Sterling.
  Annual amount of church collection * for the poor, about L.25,
10s.; mortcloth dues, L.2, 16s.; seat rents, L.5, 2s. 2d.; penal-
ties, L.2, 9s. 3d.; interestof money, L.6, 17s. 10d.; voluntary
contribution by the principal heritor, L.30; total, L.73, 10s. 3d.
There is still a laudable disinclination among the people to
come upon the poor's fund.
  Public Houses.-There are at present 5 in the parish
  Fuel.-Coal is generally used as fuel.

<FOOTNOTE>Church collection are occasionally made for charitable and benevolent purposes
not immediately connected with ` provision for the poor of the parish; and in emer-
gencies of distress, in the case of individuals or of families in the parish, it is but due
to state, that the parishioners have ever evinced a readiness to subscribe their private
contributions of aid in relief.
