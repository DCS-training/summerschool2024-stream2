of them as have any, manufacture it only once every two or
three years.  The average quantity of it cannot be accurately
ascertained, but may be about 50 tons.  The principal bays,
or harbours, are Loth-Bracadale, a good and safe harbour,
Loch-Harport, a considerable branch of Loch-Bracadale,
where vessels may ride with safety, and Loch-Eynart, at the
distance of seven computed miles south of Loch-Bracadale,
where vessels sometimes resort.  South of that, at the dis-
tance of three computed miles, is Loch-Brettle, an open bay,
and not a safe harbour.  The islands in this parish are Ha-
versay, Vuiay, Oransay, Soay.  These islands are not inhabit-

shore that are opposite to them, and afford pasture for cattle,

peninsula.  There are no remarkable mountains within the
parish; but a considerable ridge of very high and losty
hills, (the forest of the island of Sky) run betwixt this parish,
and the parish of Strath, and are the property of Lord M'Do-
nald, Colonel M'Leod, and Mr M'Alister of Strath-Aird.
They are commonly called Culinn, a name conjectured by
some to be derived from the famous Cuchulinn, so often men-
tionned in Offian's poems.  The tops of these hills are rocky,
but there are hollows, or valleys between them, frequent-
ed by deer, and which likewise afford pasture to differ-
ent kinds of cattle in the summer season.  The hills within
the parish are for the most part covered with heath, mixed
with some spote of grass, and afford good summer pasture for
horses, sheep, and cows.  The parish, in general, affords
good grazing for black cattle, and some parts of it are good
pasture for sheep.
