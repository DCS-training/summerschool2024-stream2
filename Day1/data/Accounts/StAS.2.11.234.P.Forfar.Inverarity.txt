			PARISH OF INVERARITY.

		PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

     			THE REV.  GEORGE LOUDON, MINISTER.

		     I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name.--Under this name are comprehended the contiguous
and united parishes of Inverarity and Meathie. Like most pa-
rishes in Scotland, where the Celtic language formerly prevailed,
it seems to owe its name to its particular locality. The situa-
tion of the church generally suggested its own appellation, and that
of the whole parish to which it belonged: and it appears to have done
so in the present case.  For till 1754, when it was built on its pre-
sent site, the church of Inverarity had, for a considerable period at

small distance from which, the river Arity, running from east to
west, is joined almost at right angles by the Corbie Burn. The
name of this parish, therefore, refers to that spot where the Arity
and Corbie Burn form one river.
	Extent and Boundaries.--The parish is about 3 miles square.
It is bounded on the north by the parish of Forfar; on the South
by the parishes of Monikie and Murroes; on the east by those of
Guthrie and Dunnichen; and on the west by Kinnettles-Tealing,
and Glammis. Its figure approaches that of a circld, the circum-
ference of which forms, in general, an elevated boundary, from
which the radii descending, may be conceived to meet at the centre,
occupied by the church.
	Topographical Appearances.--Although consisting principally
of a valley or little strath, yet none of its crowning eminences can
claim the name of mountains. But, " si parva componere magnis
liceat," from whatever point the traveller approaches this valley,
he may be conceived to experience, in some degree, sensations re-
sembling his who, having crossed the rugged Alps, finds himself at
length descending to the tranquil plains of Italy, watered by the Po,
and sheltered by the Apennines; for, on almost every side are
