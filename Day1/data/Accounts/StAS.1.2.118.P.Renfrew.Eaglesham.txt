     Statistical Account

with a number of fine green hills, and a great deal of natural
meadow-ground mixed together.  The tenants in this part of
the parish plow little:  Their great dependance is on their
sheep, and the rearing of black cattle.  The lower part of the
parish lying along the banks of the Cart, and to the west of
that river is a light soil, above a rotten whin-stone rock; and,
when allowed to rest for four years, it produces two excellent
crops of corn, with a very slight manure of lime or dung.
The tenants in that quarter plow only a fourth part of their
arable ground; and oats is the principal grain they raise.
Their great dependance is on the milk, butter, and cheese,
which they fell at Glasgow.  On this account, they keep few
horses, but a great number of cows, rather of the best than of
the largest kind.  In the beginning of winter, they feed them
with oat-fodder; but in the latter end of winter, and till the
pasture grass springs up, with hay, and a little corn, once a
day.

   Climate and Diseases.-The parish lies high, and enjoys
a free air.  In the moorish part of it, the air is exceedingly
sharp and cold, but in the lower part it is mild and temperate,
especially when the wind is from the west.  The village of
Eaglesham, which contains the one half of the whole inhabi-
tants of the parish, is built on ground, that is full of, and
surrounded by, springs; which renders the houses damp,
where pains are not taken to prevent it.-Consumptions
are not uncommon; but most of the deaths are occasioned by
fevers.  The fine air, and the excellent water in the parish,
make it, on the whole, exceedingly healthy:  and those who
are at a small expence in raising the floors of their houses, and
making drains, have very dry and comfortable dwellings.
There are numerous instances in this parish, of persons ar-
riving at 80 years of age, and a many beyond it.-
