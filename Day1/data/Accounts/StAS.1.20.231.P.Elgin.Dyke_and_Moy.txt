B. vii. ch. 50. takes notice of the appearance of a comet,
which seems, at least, to have much affected the atmosphere;
and possibly its approximation to the earth, in its aphelion,
might have occasioned an unusual swell of tides, and contri-
buted, in that year, to make the commotion of the waters
more violent and destructive.  " Anno Dom. 1107, incepit 
" ordo Trinitatis, & eodem anno, imperri Henrici Quarti
" quadragesimo primo, (i.e. in the 41st year of the Empe-
" ror henry the IV.), cometis in occidente apparuit, a pri-
" ma hepdomade octobris.  Nimia aquarum inundatione 
" autumnalis salio impeditur, & sterilitas frugum terrae fe-
" quitur."  The " inundatio aquarum" seems not more ap-
plicable to the clouds than to the sea, overwhelming the best
and warmest cultivated lands on the coast, best adapted to 
the production of winter grain.  For these two last quota-
tions, I am indebted to Professor Macleod, Sub-principal of 
King's College, Aberdeen; and there seems to be no doubt,
that all the above quotations relate to the era of the Good-
win Sands.
   There is another passage in Fordun, B. x. ch. 22. quoted
in Lord Hailes's Annals, that seems to relate to an after in-
undation, about 1266, being more than 160 years later than
the above dates.  "Sed in profesto undecem mille virgi-
" num, tempestas permaxima, ab aquilone suborta est, unde
" mare in rabiem concitatum, fines debitas miro modo
" transgrediens, domos, villas, arbores, complanavit, et
" damma plurima intulit multis locis, sed maxime inter flu-
" mina de le Tay & Tweed.  Tempestas talis non est visa, a 
" diebus Noae ulque ad diem illum, sunt adhuc vestigia ma-
" nifestant."
   I have also been told, upon good authority, that there is
a passage in the Red Book of the Priory of Pluscardin, now 
lying in the Advocates Library, at Edinburgh, that would 
seem to refer to an earlier inundation thatn those above
