people, it appears that the population is considerably dimi-
nished.  The greatest part of the depopulation took place 
previous to the year 1734.  If there is any decrease since
that period, it is very trifling, as appears from the examina-
tion roll of the parish at that time, compared with the exa-
mination roll of this year.  Since the year 1734 it has un-
dergone some changes in regard to numbers.  In that year
there were only 200 examinable persons in the parish,per-
sons from eight years of age and upwards.  In this slate it 
continued till the year 1741 or 1742,when it had an increase
of numbers, from having the half of the parish of Dawick
annexed to it; in consequence  of this circumstance, the
numbers were increased from 200, to between 240 and 250.
Of late years, however, the numbers have decreased.  There
are at present in the parish only 221 examinable persons,
and 97 that are not examinable, or under eight years of age;
total, 318 souls.  Among this number there are 15 Seceders.
The number of males, from eight years of age and upwards,
is 119; the females, 102.  There are 60 houses in the pa-
rish, and 5 inhabitants, upon an average, to each house.  In
Dr Webster's report, the number is 313.  The births, for
these eight years past, are,at an average, about 9 per annum;
during the same period there have been 36 burials at the 
church, but then 13 of these persons did not reside in the 
parish at the time of their death; so that 23 only have died
for these 8 years past, being,at an average,about 3 per annum.
There have been only 10 marriages during the last 8 years.

   Church, Etc.-The  church of Stobo is Gothic, and appears
from history to be between 4 and 500 years old.  Tbe re-
mains of a font, an oven, and other apparatus peculiar to 
the Popish church, are still to be seen.  It was called in an-
cient times the Parsonage of Stobo.  It appears from the ori-
