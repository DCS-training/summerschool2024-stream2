ced to short allowances.  Such is the case with this coun-
try.
   Besides, the farms are by far too small, many of them,
within these forty years being split into triple the number.
This has proceeded from the impolitic rage for prosecuting
the fishing; but it is accompanied with hurtful consequen-
ces to the tenants, as the smallness of their farms keeps
them in indigence.  It tends only to enrich the landmaster
for the present, as he takes the products at a much lower
price than would be given by a neutral merchant; he ha-

times, by possessing more, and being allowed to remain there-

landlord, he was better able to pay his rent, and could live
in a more comfortable and substantial manner.  From the
want of leases, and the tenant's being frequently obliged to
have recourse to his landmaster for supplies in his exigen-
cies, it renders him servile and obsequious.  That manly
independent spirit, which characterizes a free-born Bri-

tries, is here lost.-As the tenant has only a verbal tack,
he promising to fish for the landmaster, and to give him all
his products, and to remain upon the land during pleasure,
this proves a bar to all improvements, as he knows not if
he will reap the benefit thereof longer than one year.
Knowing that he cannot obtain the same price from his
master for the articles he has to dispose of, that another
