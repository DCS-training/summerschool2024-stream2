north of England.  They live in the bottom of deep waters, and
cannot easily be caught, without the Seine or net.  The English
char have two rows of spots upon their sides; those of Loch-
lubnaig only one.  They are also found in some other lakes in
the neighbourhood.  Pikes or jacks are very numerous in
Loch Vennachoir and Loch Achray, in the southern branch
of the Teath, and in some stagnant pools near Callander.  They
grow to a large size, and are frequently caught weighing from
12 lb.  to 20 lb., of 16 ounces, each.  They may be taken at
all seasons with bait, for which par are esteemed best; but
they are most esteemed in June, July and August.  Eels are
in all the still waters where the bottom is muddy.  Minnows
are rather scarce, being probably devoured by the larger fish.

   Pearls.-In the Teath are found considerable quantities of
muscles, which some years ago, afforded great profit to those
who fished them, by the pearls they contained, which were sold
at high prices.  The pearls were esteemed in proportion to
the glossy fineness of their lustre, their size, and shape.  Some
of the country people made 100 L. in a season, by that em-
ployment.  This lucrative fishery was soon exhausted; and
it will require a considerable time before it can be resumed
with profit, because none but the old shells, which are crook-
ed in the shape of a new moon, produce pearls of any value.

   Pearl Fishery.-They are fished with a kind of spear, con-
sisting of a long shaft, and shod at the point with two iron
spoons, having their mouths inverted; their handles are long
and elastic, and joined at the extremity, which is formed into
a socket, to receive the shaft.  With this machine in his hand,
by why of staff, the fisher, being often up to the chin in water,
gropes with his feet for the muscles, which are fixed in the
mud and sand by one end, presses down the iron spoons upon
