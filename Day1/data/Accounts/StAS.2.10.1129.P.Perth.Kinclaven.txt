				PARISH OF KINCLAVEN.

		PRESBYTERY OF DUNKELD, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLING.

		  THE REV. HENRY HENDERSON, MINISTER.

		  I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	   Name.-THE, word Kinclaven seems to be derived from the
	three Celtic words, Caen, a bead or headland ; Cil or Kil, a church
	or churchyard;. and avon, a flowing stream or river,-which is an
	etymology perfectly descriptive of the local circumstances on the

	the thriving plantations and oak coppices that are scattered over
	its surface.

	the climate must be considered highly salubrious.   There
	are many instances of very aged persons, who have spent their

	This may, no doubt, be partly owing to their temperate habits
	their out-door occupations ; but there can be no doubt that the
	situation of the parish, washed as it is by the rapid course of the
	Tay on its northern and southern boundaries, contributes also to
