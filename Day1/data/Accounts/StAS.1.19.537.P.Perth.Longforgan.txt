ver, and if for hay, about a firlot (bushel) of rye-grass upon
the Scotch acre; but if it be meant to be cut for the bestial
upon the farm, the same quantity of clover seed, with one
or two pecks of rye-grass seeds, is enough.  this is most
excellent food for horses, cows, sheep, and pigs; and if be-
gun to be cut early upon loam, it will give two good crops;
and, upon clay grounds, it will, in general, in favourable
seasons, give three crops before the frost sets in, and pro-
bably a good after-grass for pasture on both.  This grass-
crop, as it is commonly called here, is meant for one year
only; and that part which is cut for hay, generally produ-
ces very good crops, from 200 to 300 stone, of 22 lb. Eng-
lish each stone, per acre; and such part of it as is not ne-
cessary to be used at home finds a ready market at Dun-
dee or Perth.  It is perhaps worth while to mention a re-
markable instance of a crop of this kind upon the Mains of
Castle-Huntly.  In the spring of the year 1786, red clover
and rye-grass were sown amongst wheat in a field of 13
Scotch acres, which produced 6000 stone of hay; and the
second cutting of the same field was sold at L. 2: 13: 4
Sterling per acre.

   Hay.-The best time to cut the hay is when the clover is
in flower, and before the rye-grass seed is formed: For, at
that period of vegetation, the plant itself, which is the ob-
ject for use, is full of its native juices, and, of course, con-
tains more real nourishment, than afterwards, when ex-
hausted, to maturate the seed.  It is also well known to ex-
perience, that rye-grass, when suffered to seed, impoverishes
the ground exceedingly; and when cut in the stage recom-
mended, an exceeding good second crop may be expected,
otherwise not.  If the farmer means to have rye-grass seed
of his own, he may set apart a portion of his field on pur-
