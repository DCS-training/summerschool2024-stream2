unmanly indolence to deprive us of many blessings we
might otherwise enjoy.  A high degree of credit, however,
is due to the farmers in the upper part of the county, for

ved to be successful, and Britain is now reaping the me-
rited fruits of their well directed care.  Every farm almost,
through the extent of several parishes, supports 6, or at
least 4 mares; the half of which are allowed annually to
foal.  The colts are mostly sold at the fairs of Lanark and
Carnwath, and bring to the owners from L. 5 to L. 20

counties of Renfrew and Ayr, where they are trained for
the draught, till they are about 5 years old; they are then
sold at the fairs of Rutherglen from L. 25 to L. 40 each;
from thence they are taken to the Lothians, England, etc.
where they excel in the plough, the cart and the wag-
gon.
