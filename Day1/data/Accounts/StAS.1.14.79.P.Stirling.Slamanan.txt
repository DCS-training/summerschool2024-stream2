to another mill, though they are interspersed together

   Name.-Though this parish bears both the names of
Slamannan and St. Laurence, yet the first of there is now
universally used.  I find the last only used in the old re-
cords of session, and in the presentation issued forth by
his majesty, who is patron of the church, where the

strengthen this opinion, there is, upon the south-side of
the church, at a little distance, a small hill, which is call-
ed Castle Hill, where, they say, anciently stood a castle.
There are no remains of it now, only the farm-house up-
