     Of Kinghorn.

chase, the town of Kinghorn may have derived the name
which it still bears.
   The parish of Kinghorn is about 4 miles in lenght, and 3 1/2
in breadth.  It is bounded by the Frith of Forth on the S.
and E.*.  Few places are more beautifully diversified than 
the face of this parish.  It exhibits, it is true, neither lofty
mountains nor deep valleys; neither high hills, nor exten-
sive plains; but there is a very variety of soil and surface, and
an undulation of ground, which is very seldom to be met
with.  The long extended sides of little hills covered with
furze, ever-green, and almost always in bloom, or planted
with young and thriving trees of different kinds; the rich
and fertile land that lies between the great number of gen-
tlemen's seats and farmer's houses, with trees and enclosures
around them, and with here and there a ruin interspersed, as
mementos of the vicissitude of human things, present to the
eye of most picturesque and fanciful scene, and produce upon
the imagination the finest effect.  The soil is, in general, very
good, being mostly a rich black earth upon a rotten rock.
Along the sea-coast, for upwards of 2 miles, it is deep,
strong, and fertile in the highest degree.  As you retire from
the sea, it gradually becomes more and more light and shal-
low, for about a mile, as the ground rises.  Behind this,
the ground begins to fall, and the nature of the soil becomes
more variable, being some of it inclined to clay, upon a
whin-stone bottom, but most of it, thin and light upon a dry
gravel.  Almost every where throughout the whole parish,
it is sharp and very fertile, when properly managed.

   Antiquities, Natural Curiosities, and Mineral Water.-
There can scarcely be said to be any antiquities within the

*The extent of sea-coast is about 3 English miles, the greater part of it is
high and lucky, and produces very little kelp.
