acre is to an english acre nearly as 125 to 100.  If the soil
be of an inferior quality, the drills should be nearer, that
the items may cover the ground completely.

   Management.-Before the plants appear above ground,
they should be well harrowed, which destroys all annuals
that may have appeared, and opens the soil.  As soon as
they are well above ground, the usual practice is to take
away the earth from the drills on each side with a common
plough.  The earlier this is done the better, as it not only
destroys the fresh crop of weeds, but it softens the earth,
and approximates to the warmth of the sun the young
fibres, beginning to shoot; and if this operation be too long
delayed, these tender fibres, which, in process of time, are
to be loaded with an abundant crop, run a risk of being cut
off by the plough, and their progeny totally destroyed.  This
operation may be performed in half the time with the scra-
per and double-headed plough, already described for drilled
crops; i.e. the scraper goes first, and cuts up all the weeds,
and is immediately followed by the double-headed plough,
which takes away earth and weeds from the drills, and
are easily drawn by one horse.  They can be used to ad-
vantage in light soils only; for if the soil be strong, it is not
possible to get them deep enough in the ground, so as to
root out every weed; nor can they be made to loosen the
earth sufficiently for the young fibres to shoot; and if so, a
prolific crop is not to be expected.  In such soils, a com-
mon plough, upon the principle of Small's, but made light
on purpose, is certainly best.  The next operation is hand-
hoeing, which can now easily be done, and which answers a
triple purpose, as it destroys all the luxuriant weeds which
