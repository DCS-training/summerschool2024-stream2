	             PARISH OF TURRIFF.

	  PRESBYTERY OF TURRIFF, SYNOD OF ABERDEEN.

	    THE REV. JAMES CRUICKSHANK, MINISTER.

	      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-Torra or Tarra, as the name was anciently written,
and is still vulgarly pronounced, is said to signify in the Gaelic lan-
guage a mount or height, which is descriptive of the situation of
the town ; while Turreff or Turriff, derived from the same lan-
guage, signifies, we are told, " turrets or towers;"-in the me-
mory of persons alive till lately, the remains of towers were to
be seen, and those of one of them still exist in the gateway and
vaults of an old and now almost ruinous building, known by the
name of " Castle Rainy."
   Extent and Boundaries.-The mean length of the parish from
north to south is 6 1/6 miles; and the mean breadth from west to
east, 5 5/12 miles,-thus making its superficial extent about 33 1/2
square miles.  From the site of the church to the extremities of
the parish, the distance, on all sides except to the west, is so
nearly equal, that a circle, of which the town is the centre, and
the radius 4 1/4 miles, would include the whole of this parish, with
a large part of that of Forglen, from which it is separated by the
river Doveron.  The other neighbouring parishes are Alvah and
King Edward, on the north; Monquhitter, on the east; Fyvie
and Auchterless, on the south; and Inverkeithny, on the west.
   Topographical Appearances.-On the river banks and level
grounds, the prevailing soil is an alluvial deposit of clay-slate or
clay.  In some places, it is sharp, light, and gravelly, and is very
early and fertile.  The aspect of the parish is, upon the whole,
beautiful; the ground rising from the Doveron towards the south
