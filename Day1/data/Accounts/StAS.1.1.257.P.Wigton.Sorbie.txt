   There are three schools in the parish; and all the young
people are educated according to thier stations.  There is 
one inn in Garliestown, equal to any in this part of Scotland,
and five ale, or rather whisky-houses.  In the village of
Sorbie there is one house in which foreign spirits are sold,
and another in which there is nothing but whisky.  There
is very little ale sold or brewed in this parish of late
years.  The effects of public houses are most injurious to
the morals and industry of the people, especially when
little else than whisky is sold them.  A few pence pro-

any man mad.  The landlords of superstuous petty public
houses, generally waste their time, and ruin thier constitu-

neighbours.  In this shameless business they are flattered
with the notion of promoting trade. This evil does not
prevail so much here as in some other less industrious neighb-
bourhoods.
