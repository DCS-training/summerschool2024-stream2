     Statistical Account

   Fuel.-The fuel consists principally of peats, to which
heath must be frequently added.  In Eigg there is a compe-
tency of peats and heath; in Rum abundance; in Canna
there is no heath for fuel, and their store of peats is not so
abundant.  Formerly Rum helped to supply Canna in peats,
but of late years the island supplies itself, except a quantity
of coal imported from the Clyde, by the principal tacksman,
and some peats, he now carries from the coast of Sky, for the
use of his family.  Isle Muck, within itself, is ill provided in
fuel.  Formerly they were provided in peats by Rum and
Ardnamurchan; of late their supplies were solely from
Rum, with much personal toil and danger.  From Eigg,
they import boat loads ot heath, when their peats become
scarce.  In winter 1790 and 1791, there was a general scar-
city of firing throughout this parish, which Isle Muck most
severely felt.  They were reduced to the necessity of burn-
ing different kinds of furniture, such as beds, dressers, stools,
barrels; and also house timber, divots, tangles, straw, etc.
to dress their victuals.  Bringing heath from Eigg was a
constant employment when the weather permitted.

   Ploughs.-ln Eigg there are 8 ploughs; in Canna and
Sand Island, 7; in Isle Muck, 7; and in Rum, 2; but they
labour all with the spade, except two small fields.

   Antiquities and Curiosities.-There are several vestiges of
antient buildings, generally of a circular form, which tradi-
tion says were Danish forts.  From their situation, the one
being always in view of two others in opposite directions
from it, they were more probably watch towers than places
of strength.  There are no barrows or tumuli in the parish,
except one in Eigg, on the farm of Kiell Donnain, near an
old Popish chapel, from which it lies at the distance of about
