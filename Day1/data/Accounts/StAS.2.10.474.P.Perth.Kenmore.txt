               that there is a numerous population, far from being over-employ-
               ed, is, upon the whole, high, varying from Is. 3d. a day in win-
               ter, to 2s. 4d. in summer.  The wages of men-servants vary from
               L. 10 to L. 14 per annum; and of maid-servants from L. 4 to
               L 6 ; and they almost uniformly fare at the same board with
               their masters and mistresses.
                 Breeds of Cattle.-The common brees of cattle is the West
               Highland; and of sheep, the black-faced.  But the Ayrshire cow
               may sometimes be seen; as may likewise the Leicester and South-
               down breeds of sheep, particularly in the parks and pastures of
               Taymouth.  Subjoined is a view of the value of agricultural pro-
               duce, as also of live-stock.

                  Till of late years, no great attention has been paid either
               to the management of land, or to the breeding of stock.  But the
               recent efforts of the Highland Society, seconded, as in this part
               of the country they are, by the spirited encouragement of Lord
               Breadalbane, and other proprietors bid fair to lead rapidly to im-
               provements in all the departments of husbandry.  The ploughing
               matches which anntally take place in sections here and there in
               the country, together with the premiums given for green crops,
               &c. are already accomplishing very perceptible effects, as well in
               the extent and quality of these crops, in the better aspect of
               the ploughs, and horses, and their harnessing. And as we are be-                                                 rewers     of new                  of:which an astonishing number
