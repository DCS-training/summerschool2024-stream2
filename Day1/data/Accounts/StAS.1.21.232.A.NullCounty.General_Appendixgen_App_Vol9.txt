     General Appendix to [Vol. ix.

   In less than 3 weeks after the commencement of the re-
cruiting, this regiment was ordered by the Commander-in-
Chief to go upon hazardous service; and that very day four
weeks from the commencement of the recruiting, several
companies of them set off to Inverness, to quell commotions
that had arisen in that town, about corn shipping in the har-
bour there; the mob, to the amount of 3000, alledging that
it was intended for a supply to France.  They took much
of the corn out of the vessels, and sold it as they pleased.
Threatenings of an alarming nature had been uttered by tim
mob after that, which made the interference of military force
necessary.
   It is perhaps an unheard of thing, a regiment being raised,
and sent upon service, within the space of 4 weeks.
