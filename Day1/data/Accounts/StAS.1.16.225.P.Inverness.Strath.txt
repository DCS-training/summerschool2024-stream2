     of Strath.

   There are here no extraordinary instances of longevity,
but there are a few now living between 80 and 90 years
of age.  There is no tradesman here that confines himself
solely to his trade, but is occasionally a farmer, fisherman,
weaver, tailor, shoemaker, or carpenter, etc.  There is no
sectary of any kind or denomination in the parish.  The
heritors are two, viz. Lord Macdonald, and Mr Macalaster
of Strathaird.

   Produce, Rents.-There is no grain raised in the parish
but oats, which are sown in April, and reaped from the
first of September to the middle of October.  Potatoes
make a principal article of the food of the lower classes of
people.  They are planted in April and May, and ready
for digging in August and September.  The parish an-
nually imports a great quantity of meal.  The farmers de-
pend on the sale of black cattle for the means of paying
their rents, and supplying their families with what other
articles of provision and clothing they may need.  There
are 25 farms in the parish, and only about 15 small
ploughs of the Scotch kind are employed, drawn by
four horses yoked a-breast.  Many of the small tenants
turn up the ground with the Coischroim, (crooked
spade.)  The rent of the parish, without including the
kelp shores, is about L. 1300.  There are in the parish
2213 black cattle, 501 horses, 2486 sheep, and upwards
of 180 goats.  Black cattle sold this year from L. 2 to
L. 3, 8 s. per head.  Sheep at 6 s.  Butter and cheese,
very little of which is fold from the parish, sells at
present, the former 12 s. and the latter 5 s. per stone.
For geese, ducks, hens, and eggs, there is no market,
nor limited price.  The yearly wages for men-servants
are from L. 3 to L. 5, besides 3 pair of shoes.  To an over-
