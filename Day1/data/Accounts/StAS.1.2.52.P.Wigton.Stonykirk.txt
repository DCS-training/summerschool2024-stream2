     Statistical Account

   Manure.-There has been, for some years past, a vast quan-
tity of lime, for manure, imported from Whitehaven; and
delivered to the farmers, at 1 s. 2 d. the Carlisle bushel, or her-
ring barrel.  A south east wind brings plenty of sea-weed to
Balgreggan head, in the bay of Luce, which is constantly ap-
plied as manure; and is found to yeild one luxuriant crop, if
put on wet clay land, particularly if the following summer is
dry and warm.  In consequence of the great alteration
made by these articles, the value of land has increased consi-
derably.  The tenants find their account in improving, and pay
their advanced rents with greater facility than before; so that,
Galloway, (as these improvements are now becoming general)
may, with great propriety, be called a corn country.

   Produce, Exports, etc.-More grain is exported from Sto-
nykirk, than from any parish in the west of Galloway.  It is
computed, that, after supplying the inhabitants, the ex-
port amounts to 1800 bolls of oats, 900 bolls of bear, and a-
bout 100 tons of potatoes, per annum.  There is more flax
raised here than in any other parish in the neighbourhood.
That crop has been particularly attended to since the com-
mencement of the late American war.  About L. 2000, on an
average, is annually received for black cattle.  For some
years past, it has been the practice to rear a number of twine,
which were sold for slaughter; but it is now found to answer
better to kill them at home, and to send the carcases to the
London market.  That article brought about L. 200. in 1790.
All the sheep, reared in the parish, are consumed in it.  The
mutton of such as feed on the sea coast, is reckoned remarkably
high-flavoured.

   Prices of Provision and Labour.-Beef, mutton, and lamb,
sell at 3 d.-and pork at about 2 1/2 the pound;-a goose sells
