     of Deer.

It is an uncommon circumstance, and shews that this place
is by no means unfavourable to health, that there is just
now in the village of Deer a family of five persons, in
which there has been neither birth, marriage, burial, nor
bedrid person these 50 years!  The mother of this family,
who is the oldest person in the parish, thinks herself about
her hundredth year.  It is equally worthy of observation,
that there died last winter a parishioner in the 84th year of
his age, who was married two years before to his Seventh
lawful wife!

   Miscellaneous Observations.-In the village of Deer, and
in the neighbourhood, there are inns, where travellers of
every description can have good accommodation.  The
following licenses were granted within the parish for the
year ending the 10th October 1793, viz. 7 ale licenses,
4 spirit licenses, 3 wine licenses, 1 tea license, and 9 tobac-
co and snuff licenses.  Notwithstanding the few tea licenses
taken out, that article is used more or less almost in every
family.  There are at present 26 retail-shops in the parish,
2 saddler's shops, 1 baker, besides all the common trades-
men and mechanics.  The invoice of the merchants are
from L. 50 to L. 500 Sterling a-year; and their annual
profits on stock are about 10 per cent.
   The peopling of the villages and small farms, a great in-
crease of handicraftsmen, and a demand for hands to the
neighbouring manufactures, have occasioned a temporary
scarcity of servants in this place, and afforded them an op-
portunity, not only of raising their wages, but of demand-
ing some other concessions which former times denied them.
A man-servant receives about L. 6, a maid-servant from
L. 2 to L. 3 per annum.  Servants are all maintained in
the family, and probably in no part of Scotland are they
better used.
