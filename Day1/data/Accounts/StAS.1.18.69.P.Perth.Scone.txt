said, that no other river in Britain discharges more fresh
water into the sea than the Tay.  It produces eel, some
perch and pike, and four or five different sorts of trout
in great abundance, some of which have a fine flavour,
and weigh, at an average, about two pounds.  But the
most valuable fish which it affords, is salmon, which is
reckoned excellent, and of which the greater part is ex-

gentlemen, who are fond of angling.
   The Tay also abounds in the pearl-oyster.  Numbers
of pearls were fished out of it about thirty-five years
ago.

very much within the last twelve years, and is still encreasing.
Scarcely can houses be built fast enough to accommodate
those who want them.
   This has been owing to several causes.  Before the end of
the year 1792, our manufacturers had for several years, been
