castle of Dalhousie, a building of great antiquity, constructed in
the old Scottish taste, is pleasantly situated on the northern bank
of the river, which runs at a few yards distance from the foot of
the walls.  This castle was modernized by the late Earl of Dal-
housie, and has thereby lost much of its former vencrable as-
pect.  The grounds around it are, by nature, peculiary a-
dapted for extensive and romantic pleasure grounds.  A little
lower, on the opposite bank of the same river, stood the man-
sion house of Cockpen; lately purchased by the Earl of Dal-
housie, from Mr Baron Cockburn, by whom the adjacent
lands had been inclosed and greatly improved.  Along the 
steep and woody banks of the river, he had also formed various
walks, at a great expence, and in the finest taste, which are
still the delight of every visitant; but a few bare walls are now
all that remains of his hospitable mansion, serving, however,
to increase the wild, and romantic beauty of the surrounding
scenery.

   Population-By a lift, found among the papers of the then
incumbent, it appears, that, in 1749, there were in the parish,
160 families, containing 299 miles, and 349 females, or 648
individuals; of which, 454 were above, and 194 under 10
years of age.  The return to Dr Webster was 640 fouls.  By an
enumeration made by the present minister, in 1790, it was
found, that there were 288 families in the parish, and 1123
individuals; 5 of whom were above 80, and 195 were dissen-
ters from the Established Church.  Thus, it appears, that the
population has increased 475 in the space of 40 years.  There 
has been an increase, even since 1783, of 123.  This addi-
tion was chiefly on the property of Mr Calderwood Durham,
and has been occasioned by a very flourishing coalliery, and by
giving small seus to industrious labourers, mechanics, and
manufacturers.-The annual average of baptisms, for 7
