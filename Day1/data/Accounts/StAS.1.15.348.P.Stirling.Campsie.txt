to fodder, as they term it, about Christmass, (It is consider-
ed as a severe winter, when they are forced to begin before
Christmas,) and continue till about the beginning of April,
when the cattle refuse it.  There are few cattle grazed with
us but Highlanders, and we prefer those from Argyleshire,
and the isles:  North country cattle are rejected, as they are
considered by the graziers as sour and difficult to feed: graz-
ing of Highland cattle upon brae-ground in this district owes
much of the perfection to which it has been brought, to Mr
David Dun, a native of this parish.-He has spent the better
of his life in the prosession of a shepherd, grazier, and breed-

the Highland shepherds for brood rams:-He has sold forty

he is enabled to gather enough amongst their feet to fod-

which gives him the option of merchants.  2dly, By having
