   Quarries.-Those who reside in the northern parts, con-
tiguous to Mortlach, burn and fell annually about 4000 bolls
of lime, at 6 d. per boll; two firlots Aberdeen measure make
a boll.  Lime is little used here as a manure, on the suppo-
sition that it turns the crop late.  It is presumed, however,
that in some parts it would be attended with advantage.
   Besides great numbers of limestone quarries, there is a
slate quarry, of a light grey colour on the Hill of the Bank;
there being little demand for the slates, the quarry is not in
lease.  They are not sold, but given gratis.

   Forrests.-The banks of the river Dovern, about half a
century ago, were covered with birch, although, since the
sale of it, there is not a plant of wood to be seen there, or in
any part of the parish, except in Glen-Feddich, where there
are some old trees, and on the burn of Bank, where there
are some young bushes.  The Feddick, which runs into
the Spey, between Aberlour and Boharn, rises between Ca-
brach and Glenlivet, and runs into Mortlach.  On its banks
the Duke of Gordon has a house for a hunting seat in a beau-
tiful romantic spot, but within the parish of Mortlach.  He
has another farther up on the Black-water, in the same pa-
rish.  The forests of Gleneddich and Black-water are stored
with red deer and roes; the hills all around, with innumer-
able flocks of muir-fowl.  Here there are partridges, hares,
foxes, otters, wild ducks, and black cocks.  The migratory
birds are the swallow, the plover, and cuckow, who appear
about the middle of April.
