			PARISH OF KIRRIEMUIR.

	PRESBYTERY OF FORFAR, SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.

		THE REV.  THOMAS EASTON, D. D. MINISTER.

		I.--TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
	Name, Boundaries, &c.--KIRRIDMTIR lies at the north side of
the extensive and fertile valley of Strathmore, in the county of
Angus, and is about eighteen miles from Dundee, twenty from
Arbroath, and as many from Montrose. The name is by some
supposed to be compounded of two words, Corrie-mor, the large
hollow or den; by others, it is said to be a Celtic word, which
means the "large quarter or district." The position of the town,
on the side of a ravine or den, which extends nearly a mile in
length, and is upwards of 100 feet in depth, supports the former
derivation; while the latter, may be supposed to have reference to
the great extent of country which the parish embraces.
	The parish is divided into two considerable districts, which are
separated from each other by part of the parish of Kingoldrum:
the one, the northern, usually called Glenprosen, is chiefly
pastoral,--the other, the southern, is agricultural and manufactur-
ing. The southern division is nearly square in its form, being,
according to Mr Blackadder, about five miles in each direction;
and contains about 16,000 imperial acres. The northern division
is about nine miles in length, and varies, according to the same
authority, from two to four miles in breadth. It contains about
18,000 imperial acres.
	The southern division of the parish is bounded on the west by
Airly and Kingoldrum; on the nnrth by Kingoldrum; on the
east by Cortachy, Tannadice and Oathlaw; and on the south by
Forfar and Glammis. The northern division is bounded on the
west by Lintmthen and Glenisla; on the south by Kingoldrum;
on the east by Cortachy; and on the north  by Clova.
	Topographical Appearances.--Nothing can be more dissimilar
than the two districts into which the parish has been divided;
