   Agriculture, etc.-The valued rent of the parish is
L. 2161: 13: 4 Scots.-The real rent was lately estimated
in a rental given in to the Court of Teinds, in a process of
augmentation of stipend, at L. 1089 Sterling.  There are
38 proprietors of land, 21 of whom reside.  The greatest
number of these have from L. 5 to L. 50 Sterling a-year;
a few have from L. 50 to L. 80; and only two are worth
above L. 100.  Of these, the one was estimated in the ren-
tal before mentioned at L. 115, and the other at L.120 a-
year.  The lands belonging to the non-residing heritors are
farmed mostly by tenants, but the greatest part of the re-
siding heritors occupy their own lands, which they labour
chiefly themselves, with the assistance of their children, a
few of them having, besides what they possess themselves,
some small pendicles let to tenants  The ground that is
inclosed is commonly let yearly by public roup some time

sures, for the purpose of grazing; which generally brings

lage.  A considerable part of the lands in the parish is in-
closed, but the greatest part is still open, and in a natural
state.  Some of the proprietors are not sufficiently sensible
of the advantages of inclosing, and do not seem to aspire
