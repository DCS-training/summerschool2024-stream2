which was as high, some years ago, as L.60 or L.70; but which
of late years has fallen to L.30 or L.40.
   Library.-A parish library has existed for some years. Number
of volumes about 200.
   There is a benefit society for funerals.
   There is no savings bank in the parisb, but a good many of the
inhabitants have taken advantage of the establishment of a bank
in Dunfermline last year, on the national security system, by lodg-

   Jail.-A small jail, containing an apartment for debtors, and
another for criminals, is attached to the town house; it is consider-
ed sufficiently secure.
   Inns.-There are two inns in the town, and five other houses in the
town and parish, where spirituous liquors are dither sold to cus-

of late years; from which circumstance we would willingly argue,
that the desire for indulgence in spirituous liquors, which is de-
plored as rtch an evil through the country, is on the decline in
this place.

It appears to the writer of this account, that a corruption has taken
place alike in its written orthography and its provincial pronun-
ciation. There can be little doubt that the saint after whom it is
