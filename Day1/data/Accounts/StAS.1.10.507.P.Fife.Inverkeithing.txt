of the partners.  The spirits are said to be of a fine, and
even superior quality; they are sold at the common current
prices; and the sale of them is very extensive.  It seems to

a brewery, carried on to no great extent, and serving chiefly

who import annually from the Baltic large quantities of
wood; they have extensive and rapid sales, and are very

to coal; and the manufactured goods can be transported ve-
