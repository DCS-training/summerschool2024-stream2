<FOOTNOTE>

*The value of the horses used in theparish, is from 10 L. to 30 L., when at
their prime; but, because many of them may be aged, they are valued at a-
bove.
+In the above number, are not included the cattle grazed and fed in the
grass enclosures, which may amount to 600.  Many of the cattle reared bere
have been sold at 10 L., 15 L., and some even at 18 L.; but, because the greatest
number are of an inferior quality, 6 L. has been judged to be the medium.
