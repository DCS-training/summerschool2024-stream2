     Statistical Account

average each year they may be estimated at 28 pair.  Nei-
ther does this ascertain the number of marriages, as the
bans of marriage are published in the parish where either
the bride or bridegroom resides.  I find from the 23 d June
1791 to the same date in 1794, I have married only 54
pair; average each year during this period, 18.

   Minister.-From all all information I have received,
there have been here five Presbyterian ministers since the
Revolution, Mr Guthrie, Mr Brown, Mr Farquhar, Mr
Walker, and the writer of the present account.  Mr Brown
left this parish, and was afterwards settled at Behelvie, in
the presbytery of Aberdeen:  Mr Farquhar went to Chapel
of Garioch, in the presbytery of Garioch, and died only a
few years ago.  He was father of Mr John Farquhar, late
minister of Nigg, the author of two volumes of sermons,
which are so generally and deservedly esteemed.  They re-
ceive an additional value from the character of the author,
whose life was a transcript of the sentiments he published.
He died at a very early age; the warmth of his affection
was the cause of his death; having overheated himself in
going to see a friend, who was ill of a fever, he was in a
few days seized with the same disorder, which soon proved
fatal:

     Multis ille bonis flebills occidit,
     Nulli flebilior quam MIHI.

   My predecessor was father likewise of Mr Walter Far-
quhar, so eminent in London for his extensive practice and
skill in the medical prosession.  Both his sons were born
in this parish.  The present incumbent was settled here
in 1763.
