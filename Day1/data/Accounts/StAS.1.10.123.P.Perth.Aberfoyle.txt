   3d, For the average of Marriages, the sum of 5 annually
may be assumed*.

   All the inhabitants of Aberfoyle consist of farmers, or
tacksmen, (whose number is about 38), a few subtenants,
shepherds, cottagers, and handicraftsmen, with their respec-
tive families.  Of handicraftsmen, viz. smiths, taylors, shoe-
makers, weavers, masons, and carpenters, the number is about
16.
   The number of inhabited houses is 157, which, at the
common calculation of 5 persons to every family, corresponds
very nearly with the actual population of the parish.
   From the above tables may be seen the annual proportion
between the births, marriages, and deaths, and the whole
population of the parish.  The produce of every marriage
appears, at a medium, to be nearly 6.
   All the inhabitants are of the established Church, excep-
ting 5 or 6 families, who are Nonjurants, and adhere to the
Episcopalian form of worship.  There are 2 poor persons
from the remote Highlands who prosess the Roman Catholic
faith.  The Secession is altogether unknown.

<FOOTNOTE>

*The inhabitants of this parish generally arrive at a good
old age.  There are now living 7 or 8 persons above 80.  In
January 1793, a man died at the age of 97; and the grave-
digger of the parish, whose age is 101, is still alive, and, till -
within these few weeks, has been able to perform his office re-
gularly.
