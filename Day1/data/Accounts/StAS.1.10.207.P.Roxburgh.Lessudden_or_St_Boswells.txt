ploy themselves during winter in spinning; they endeavour to
get their webs ready against the fair, where they are pretty
sure of a market, though not always of a sufficient racompence
for their expences and labour; nevertheless, upon the whole,
they get such prices as encourage them to be industrious in
the same line.  The prices, according to the quality of the
cloth, are from 10 d. and 1 s. to 3 s. 6 d. 4 s. and 4 s. 6 d.
per yard.  Some provide themselves in linen at this fair, al-
ledging that they can furnish themselves cheaper and better
at it, than they could do by manufacturing at home.  This
may possibly be true; for, in genteel families, the expence of
maintaining the workers will be higher than the spinster in a
cottage, while the skill and care bestowed on the work are
equal.  Booths, (or, as they are here called, craims), contain-
ing hardware and haberdashery goods, are erected in great
numbers at the fare, and stored with such articles as suit the
generality.  The money turned in the course of the day at
this fair is guessed to be from 8000 L. to 10,000 L. Sterling.
The Duke of Buccleugh receives a certain rate or toll upon
sheep, cattle, and all other commodities brought into the fair
for sale.  Old sheep pay 1 merk Scotch per score, lambs one
half of that sum, and so on.  This toll is sometimes collected
by people appointed for the purpose; but it is more common-
ly let to some individual for such a sum of money as can be
agreed on.  The highest at which it ever was let was 53 L.
the lowest 33 L. and the average is supposed to be about 381.

ago, was ruinous, unpleasant, extremely cold, and injurious
to health; but, by a thorough repair, has been made one of
the best in the country.  The expence incurred was 100 L.
