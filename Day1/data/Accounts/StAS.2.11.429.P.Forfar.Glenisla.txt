assignation of the allotments of each to one or two separate te-

	Amount of population in   1791,        1018
                                   1811,        1209
                                   1821,        1144
                                   1831,        1129, viz. 566 males, and 563 females.
                                   1841,        1134
      The yearly average of births is                                      27
                                 marriages,                                84
                                 deaths,                                   14
         The number of persons at present under 15 years of age is        377
                                              betwixt 15 and 30,          284
                                                      30 and 50,          258
                                                      50 and 70,          139
                                              upwards of 70,               36
From this last statement it appears, that, since 1831, there has
been a decrease of population of 35,--a circumstance owing chiefly
to the removal of several families to the neighbouring parish of
Alyth.
	There are twenty-one proprietors of land of the yearly value
of L.50 and upwards; twelve of these reside in the parish, and
nine are non-resident.
Of unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers, upwards of 50 years of age, the
  number is                                                                29
 The number of unmarried women upwards of 45, is                           34
	There is one fatuous person, a male; and four deaf and dumb,
one male and three females.
	A few of the families, originally from Kirkmichael parish, usu-
ally converse together in the Gaelic tongue; but the language
generally spoken is the dialect peculiar to Angus-shire, with a
slight approach, in the upper district, to the Gaelic accent.
	Character of the People.--In their general character, the
people are sober, obliging, and industrious; much attached to
their native glen, and to one another; attentive and hospitable
to strangers, and charitable to the wandering poor. They
are regular in observing the public ordinances of religion, and
the attendance of late, both at the week and Sabbath day-
schools, evinces that they are manifesting an increasing anxiety
for the moral and religious improvement of the young.

	Agriculture.--The number of cultivated imperial acres in the
parish is about 3960, and of uncultivated upwards nf 30,000. Of
these a Portion, equal, to one-seventh of the present arable acres,
might be profitably added to the cultivated land. The number of
acres in a state of undivided common is about 4500, and the num-
ber under wood, natural and planted, may be 500. The planta-
