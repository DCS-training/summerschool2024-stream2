     Statistical Account

severity, that then generally prevailed, is now found only
amongst a few.  The violence of party spirit seldom ap-
pears.  The sectaries have subdivided, weakened their
own influence, and seen the solly of their former disputes.
Many of them are now peaceable, social, and friendly in
their dispositions.  Various denominations of Christians
converse freely with each other, enjoy mutual intercourse
in business, as well as in social, relative, and dome-
stic walks of life.  Upon the whole, the people are in
general sober, industrious, and religious.  They have just
views of religion and morality.  All attend public wor-
ship, and are apparently decent and devout, excepting a
few of the wealthy, and a few of the ignorant and the
prosligate, who neglect the ordinances of religion.
