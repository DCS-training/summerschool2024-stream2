ed about 50,000 spindles of thread and yarn, and above 3000
pieces of mussin and lawn yearly.  This and the weaving bu-
siness causes a considerable circulation of money in the vil-
lage and neighbourhood.

   Church, Manse, Glebe, and Stipends.-The kirk of Killallan
is still standing, and the roof is entire.  The heritors were im-
powered, by the decreet of annexation, to tell the manse,
which was a bad house, and the glebe, to enable them to build
a church at Houstoun, sufficient to accommodate the inhabi-
tants of both parishes.  The new church of Houstoun was
built in the year 1775, and can accomodate with feats 150
persons beside the parishioners, which is very convenient
when the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed.  The
glebe at Houstoun is about six acres of arable land, besides
garden, house, and outhouses.  The annexed stipend amounts
to 66 bolls of oat-meal, 14 bolls of barley, and L. 78 Ster-
ling, of old and new money stipends.  The greatest part of
the money stipends arises from 92 bolls of oat-meal, con-
verted by the decreet of annexation at 10 merks per boll,
being the usual conversion at the time; for which the heri-
tors now receive 16 s. from the tenants; which has turned
out to be a considerable diminution of the stipends.  This
was done by a petition from the heritors to the Lords, etc.
with consent of the presbytery, because a great part of the
united parishes is more fit for pasture than village, and might
in time be used for that purpose.  The above money stipends
comprehend L 40 Scots for communion elements.  Mr
Monteath, ordained Feb. 1748, is now pastor of the united
parishes.  Mr Robert Carrick was last minister of Houstoun 
previous to the annexation of the parishes; he was ordained
in the year 1720 or 1721, and died May 1. 1771, aged 89
years, 10 months, and twenty days.
