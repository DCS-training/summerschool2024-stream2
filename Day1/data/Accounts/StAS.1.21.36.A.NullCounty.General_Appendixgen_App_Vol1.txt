General Appendix to [Vol. i.

   There is scarce any part of the parish which is not arable,
and most of it actually bears crops, chiefly of oats; yet it is
by no means able to supply itself, including the town, with
provisions.  Large supplies, both of vegetable and animal
food, are brought in from all the neighbouring country,
from Galloway, and often from Ireland.  Clover and rye
grass are frequently sown with great profit.
   The town has still in its possession a small stripe of pasture
ground along the sands, for about a quarter of a mile to the
S.; as also, at some distance to the S. E. a common, of be-
tween 80 and 90 acres, for feeding milk cows, and free to
every burgess.  The greatest part of the common to the S.
a large circular field, has been of late inclosed with a good
stone wall, which has immediately within it a fine race course.
The field has likewise been cleared of whins or furze.
   The whole land rent of the parish amounts at present to
about L. 3700 sterling; and the extent is said to be some-
thing more than 5000 acres.
   Though the climate is healthy, many examples of that ex-
traordinary longevity, which are reported from other places,
cannot be produced.  Several persons among us are above
80 years, and we have four at present on the borders of 90.
It is said that, in the year 1745, one of the inhabitants, at
the age of 114, walked from Ayr to Leith, and there took
shipping for London, where he died, after a stay of only two
months.  The town stands on a dry sandy soil, and has fields
adjoining, than which, none can be sitter for walking, or
for the diversions of racing, golfing, etc.  Every one has
easy access to the turf, covered at all seasons with a beautiful
verdure, and in Spring and Summer adorned with wild
dairies and other flowers.
   The sea-shore, is flat and shallow; and the navigation
of the river, where the tide never flows above 12 feet, is
