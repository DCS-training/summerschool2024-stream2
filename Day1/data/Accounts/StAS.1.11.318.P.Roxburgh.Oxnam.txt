runs, and where passengers cross the water of Fed; Bloody-
laws, a rising ground, where much blood was shed by the
licentious Borderers; Pearflaws, another rising ground, where
perhaps there had been an orchard; etc.  Plenderleith, Ric-
calton, and Dolphiston, are most probably the names of their
original proprietors.

   Form, Extent, and General Appearance.-The figure of the
parish bears a striking resemblance to that of Scotland.  The
greatest length, from the head of Coquet water, on the Eng-
lish border, in a line by Swinside, to Capehope, a farm stead
on the N. point of the parish, in a direction N. W. 1/2 N., is
9 3/8 English miles; the greatest breadth, in a perpendicular di-
reaction, from Kaimburnsoot, on the W., in a line by Swinside,
to Conzierton march on the E,, is 4 7/8 English miles; on the
N. it runs nearly to a point; and about 2 1/2 miles from the S.
end, it is only 2 miles broad.  The general complexion is
rather bleak, interspersed with beautiful green hills, fertile
fields, and dark heath; and almost uninclosed.  But though
it is hilly, yet there are no hills of very considerable magnitude.

   Climate, Soil, and Diseases.-The country is damp, and
the air often moist, by rains from all directions, and in parti-
cular from the E.  The rains arising out of Solway Frith, on
the S., are conducted, as it were along the vale of Liddis-
dale, and frequently fall in great quantities on the adjoining
fells, whilst they scarcely touch this parish.  The soil is vari-
ous, admitting both the amusements of pasturage, and the la-
bours of agriculture.  At the same time, the agreeable inter-
change of hill, dale, and streams of water, gives a vibration to
the air which renders it healthy, and free from agues.  Certain
it is, however, that rheumatisms, consumptions, and nervous
fevers are pretty frequent.
