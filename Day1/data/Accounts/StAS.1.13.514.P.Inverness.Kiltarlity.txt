     Statistical Account

Fraser of Belladrum, one of the heritors, has been planting
for upwards of 30 years past.  He has successfully intro-
duced most of the different trees planted for use or orna-
ment in Great Britain.  All his plantations are in a very
thriving state, some of them of a considerable size, and sit
for use.  He was the very first person who introduced the
larix into this North country.  Many of his larches near
his house are of a great size.  This is found to be a very
hardy tree, having this singular advantage, that it seems to
advance faster than any other that has as yet been introdu-
ced into this country, and thrives almost in any soil, or in
any situation, and its wood is supposed to be equally valuable
with most other species of the pine for flooring, and some
other uses.

   Birds, Beasts.-We have all the land birds that are in
the neighbouring parish of Kirkhill, and which have been
formerly described, only this parish abounds much more
with moor fowl and black game than Kirkhill.  We have
also some ptarmagans, though not in such numbers as they
are to be found on the tops of the high mountains in the
neighbouring parish of Kilmorack.  In the higher parts of
this parish a great number of ravens nestle among the rocks.
The large blue hawk, about the size of a common hen,
nestles in the rocks of Mayne.  This is one of the most raven-
ous birds in this country:  though not so strong as the eagle,
it is much more fierce and agile; and when the eagle and
this bird sight, and former is commonly worsted.  We have
also two different species of glede, or kite, which breed in
this parish.  The caperkaily, or king of the wood, said to
be a species of wild turkey, was formerly a native of this
parish, and bred in the woods of Strath-glass: one of these
birds was killed about 50 or 60 years ago, in the church-
yard of Kiltarlity.
