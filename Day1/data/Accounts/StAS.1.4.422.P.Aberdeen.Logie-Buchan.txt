     Statistical Account

   The surface is pretty flat, with some rising grounds in it,
but none that can properly be called a hill, or which are
not arable and improvable.  The soil in general is fer-
tile, but more barren on the banks of the river, than far-
ther removed from it; and the river Ythan, I believe, is
pretty singular in this, that its banks, during the whole
course of it, are barren, rocky, and covered with heath,
(a few small haughs excepted), even in a fertile country
where heath is very scarce, On the N. side of the river,
the soil is in general a rich loam on a clay bottom, or a
strong red clay, which, in seasons that are neither too wet
nor too dry, yields a rich crop, but it often fails.  On the
S. side of the river, the soil for more than a mile to the
S. and W. is light and black, on a gravelly or rocky bot-
tom; but as you advance to the westward, it becomes a
rich loam, and in some places a strong unmanageable red
clay.

   River.-Ythan is the only river in this parish; it pro-
duces salmon, the common burn trout, the salmon trout,
and the sinnack.  The first is in season in spring, and the
two latter in August; it produces also eels and slounders,
which are highly esteemed.  Near the mouth of the river,
there is a very fine bed of muscles and cockles, which sup-
plies the neighbouring countrty, the town of Aberdeen,
and also the fishers of the whole Buchan cost with bait.
The muscles, about 12 years ago, were sold at 4 d. the
peck on the spot; but the present tacksman raised them to
6 d. and this spring to 7 d. which bears very hard upon
the fishers, who must pay at the rate, or L. 1 yearly for
each man or boy who goes out to sea; and they are un-
der the necessity of complying with his demands, however
unreasonable, as no substitute has ever yet been discovered,
