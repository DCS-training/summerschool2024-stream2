            I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
     Name.-THE name of this parish does not appear, from our ear-
liest records, which go back to the time of its establishment, to
have undergone any change. It may fairly be supposed to have
originated from the intimate connection which is known to have
existed between the ancient Royal family of Scotland when re-
sident at Falkland and this part of the country. About 800
acres of the richest land of the parish were originally their pri,-
vate property. It is held of the Crown in feu, and pays to the
Exchequer a specified amount of grain and money. The place
is shown, and the form of a moat is still discernible immediately
above the sea-beach, and about half a mile from the village, where
what was called the Castle of Kingsbarns once stood. The re-
mains of its foundation, composed of large and massy stones, regu-
larly laid, were a few years ago removed by the present tenant. As
a royal or baronial residence the site is certainly small; but if it
be viewed as the place where the above feu, chiefly in grain, was
deposited until removed for the use of the royal household at Falk-
land,__in fact, as the granary or barn of the King,__then the size
is suitable, and the name of the parish is fairly derived, and readily
explained. Its castellated form was essential when the maurading
incursions of the Scandinavian nations, in these days of rapine and
violence, are borne in mind.
     Extent-Boundaries.__The parish forms, of course with many
inequalities of line, a square of nearly 4 English miles. It is dis-
tant six and a-half miles from St Andrews, and three from Crail.
It is bounded by the former parish on the north, and by the latter
on the south; by the German Ocean on the east; and by the pa-
rish of St Leonards on the west.
     Topoqraphical Appearances.__There is no ground of great eleva-
tion within the parish. From the west, its highest range, to the east,
