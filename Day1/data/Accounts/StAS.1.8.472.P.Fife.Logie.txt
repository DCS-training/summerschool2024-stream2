together with some carpenters, masons, day labourers, and
servants.

   Proprietors and Rents.-Besides the three small heritors
above mentioned, who reside in the parish, and cultivate their
own ground, there are six greater proprietors, who do not re-
side, which is a considerable loss to the poor.  The valued
rent is 2916 l. 6s. 8d. Scotch; the real rent is not exactly
known.  The rent of farms, in general, run from 20s. to 40s.
per acre.  Some however, have their land on more reasonable
terms.

   Church, etc.-The manse was built in 1736, and has since
got several partial reparations; but it is still in a very in-
different state.  The stipend amounts, on an average, to 80 l.
Sterling per annum.  The glebe consists of 4 acres arable, and
2 acres of a den for pasturage.  The King is patron*.  There are
a good many Seceders, who attend a Burgher meeting house,
in the neighbouring parish of Kilmeny.

   School and Poor.-A good school and school-house are now
building, (1792); which, when completed, will be very com-
modious.  The salary is only 4 l. 18s. 3 1/2d., with 50 merks from
a mortification, left in 1690, by Sir James Ramsay, Bart. of
Easter Logie.-The capital stock belonging to the poor amounts
to 120 l. Serling.  The collections at the church doors are but
very inconsiderable.  There are 3 stated pensioners on the
poor's funds, who get 1s. per week, and are paid at that rate

of Justice, bequeathed a large folio Bible, for the use of the minister on Sundays,
