Leadhills, discovered a very valuable vein of silver, in the glen
that separates the Middle-hill from the Wood-hill.  It made its
first appearance in small strings of silver ore, which being fol-
lowed, led to a very large mass of that precious ore; part of
this had the appearance of malleable silver, and was found u-
pon trial to be so exceedingly rich, as to produce 12 ounces
of silver from 14 ounces of ore.  A sum not greater than
L. 40, or, at the most L. 50, had been expended when
this valuable discovery was made.  During the space of thir-
teen or fourteen weeks, it has been credibly affirmed that
ore was produced to about the value of L. 4000 per week,
and it has been conjectured, that Sir John drew from L. 40,000
to L. 50,000, besides much ore, which was supposed to have
been purloined by the workmen.  When this was exhausted,
the silver ore began to appear in smaller quantities; and sym-
ptoms of lead, with other metals, were discovered.  The
consequence of which was, that all further researches were at
that time laid aside.  There are still in the possession of Lord
Alva, Nephew of the late Sir John Erskine, some exceeding-
ly, rich pieces of silver ore, which had been got at that time,
and which evidently shew how very valuable that mass of
ore must have been*.
   These have been examined by many of Lord Alva's friends,
who have admired, not merely the richness of the ore, but its
beauty; the pure native virgin silver being observed to
adhere in slender strings to the spar, in a variety of fanciful and
irregular forms.

*In the year 1767, Lord Alva, of some of the remains of that at ore in his
possession, caused a pair of Communion Cups to be made, for the use of the
Church of Alva; on these, the following inscription is engraved.  Sacris,
