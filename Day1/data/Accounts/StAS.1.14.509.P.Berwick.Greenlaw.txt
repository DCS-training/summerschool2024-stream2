of sheep amounts to about 2500.  The attention which
has been paid, for some years past, to the improvement
of the breed of sheep, has greatly increased the value of
the wool.  In 1791 and 1792, laid wool sold from 14 s.
to 18 s. 6 d. a-stone; and white wool considerably higher.
This year it has fallen about 2 s. the stone.

   Population.-According to Dr. Webster's report, the
number of souls in 1755 was 895.  An accurate enume-
ration of the inhabitants of the parish was made in sum-
mer 1785.  They amounted then to 1210, of whom 223
were below 8 years of age.  Of the 987 who were above
8 years, 832 were of the Established Church; 62 were
Burghers; 82 Antiburghers; 7 Cameronians; and 4 of
the Relief persuasion.  There are 7 heritors, 3 of whom
reside in the parish.  About one half of the inhabitants
live in the town of Greenlaw; the rest live in farmsteads
and detached houses, and in a small village, in the N. part
of the parish, which contains about 60 people.  Almost 
the whole of the town of Greenlaw is feued.  The
feuars are about 80 in number.  There are several in-
stances of longevity in the parish.  Some years ago, 2
persons died upwards of 90.  There is 1 alive at present
aged 93, another 87, and several somewhat above 80.

*Feuing is a mode of holding landed property very common in Scot-
land.  The purchaser holds of a subject superior, to whom, besides the
money given when the lands are bought, he pays a perpetual yearly ac-
knowledgement, which is termed feu-duty.  The purchase money paid
for the grounds feued in Greenlaw is 80 L. the English acre, and the feu-
duty 1 s. 10 L.  The Earl of Marchmont is superior.
