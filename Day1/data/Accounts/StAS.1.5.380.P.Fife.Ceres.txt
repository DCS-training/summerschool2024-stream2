is, like the names of most other places in this part of the 
island, of Gaelic original, bearinf an allusion to the situa-
tion of the village, or to some historical fact concerning it 

   Extent, Soil, Minerals, etc.-The greatest length of the
parish,from Magask moor on the N. E. where it joins the 
parish of St Andrew's, to Clatto den on the S. W. where it 
joins the parish of Kettle, is about 8 statute miles.  The 
breadth is various, from half a mile to 4 miles.  The con-
tents may be about 8000 acres.  The soil, as may be ex-
pected in to great an extent of ground, is of different qua-
lities. Along the banks of Eden, in the N. W. part of 
the parish, it is light, inclining to land, and lies upon free-
stone rock.  The greater part of the parish, is a deep cold 
earth, lying upon whinstone rock, limestone rock, or tilly 
clay.  A small extent, around the village, is a free earth 
lying upon gravel.  There are two considerable mossess, and 
several moors, some of greater, some of smaller extent. 
The parish, in general, is hilly; but none of the hills are 
of great heights, or very sleep: Almost all of them are cul-
tivated to the summit.  A beautiful little valleys runs about 
a mile west, and about as far east, from the village.  A-
long the north side of the parish, there is plenty of free-
stone rock, not dificult to be wrought.  The south side 
abounds with whinstone rock.  On the farm of New-
bigging of Craighall. there is a little hill called Gatber-cold
craig, the west side of which conflicts of a mass  of basaltic 
pillars, of  an hexagonal form,, of various heights and dia-
meters, and joined at irregular distances.  There are 3 
lime works, and 1 coal work in the parish, all wrought to 
a considerable extent.  The value of the coal work is 
much diminished by the expence of a steam engine, for 
drawing off the water.  Two coal pits, wrought in the 
parish, about 10 years ago, are now given up.
