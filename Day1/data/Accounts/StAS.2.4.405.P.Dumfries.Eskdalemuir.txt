menced, but I was told by an old man, John Murray, who died
at the farm of Irving, as you go from Langholm to Canobie, and
had formerly been a proprietor in Eskdalemuir, that he was acquaint-
ed with or at least had seen an old man, I think his name was Beat-
tie, who was grandson to a couple of people who had been hand
fasted. You perhaps know that the children born under the hand-
fasting engagement were reckoned lawful children, and not bas-
tards, though the parents did afterwards resile. This custom of
hand-fasting does not seem to have been peculiar to your parish,
for there are instances of its having prevailed elsewhere. Men-
tion is made in some histories of Scotland that Robert II. was
hand-fasted to Elizabeth More before he married Euphemia Ross,
daughter of Hugh, Earl of that name, by both of whom he had
children; and his eldest son, John, by Elizabeth More, viz. King
Robert III., commonly called Jock Ferngyear, succeeded to the
throne in preference to the sons of Euphemia, his married wife.
Indeed, after Euphemia's death, he married his former hand-fast-
ed wife Elizabeth."

To which last, if the 20 who went to America in the spring pre-
vious to the census, be added, they will bring the number to 670,
or only 13 fewer than the year before.
	By the return to Government in 1821, the inhabited houses
were 117, occupied by 119 families, which, in a population of 651,
gives 51 51 69 to each family. And by the return to Government in
1831, the inhabited houses were 114, occupied by 115 families,
which, in a population of 650, gives 51 71 53 to each family.
