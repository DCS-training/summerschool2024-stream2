     Statistical Account

About 2 miles N. of the village, is Craighall, which almost
exceeds description.  The house stands upon the point of a
rock, above the river Cricht, at least 100 feet in height.
It was a place of strength.  The river, and that high rock,
defended it upon the N. and W. side.  There is no way to
it, but from the S.  There are round towers at each side
of the house, and the vertiges of a ditch.  Above the river,
S.E. from the village, in a beautiful situation, is a Drui-
dical temple, much defaced, and many of the stones carried
off.  The farm upon which it has been built, is called
Standing Stones.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is at a little distance
from Rattray, a cascade or fall of water, about 10 feet
high, over a rugged rock, which forms a pool below, where
salmon are caught.  It goes by the name of the Keith
Fishing, and rents at L. 30 a year.  The mode of fishing
is curious:  They make what they call a drimuck, resem-
bling thin wrought mortar, which they throw into the
pool, to disturb the clearness of the water.  The fishers
stand upon the point of the rock, with long poles, and nets
upon the end of them, with which they rake the pool,
and take up the fish.  Sportsmen look upon the water of
Cricht, as one of the finest rivers for rod-fishing, both for
trout and salmon.-The mosses are mostly exhauted, which
renders fuel expensive.  Coals, from Dundee and Perth,
are the principal fuel made use of here, which takes up
much time, as the carriage is both long and expensive.
