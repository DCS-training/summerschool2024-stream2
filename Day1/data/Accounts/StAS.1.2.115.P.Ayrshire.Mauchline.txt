     of Machlin.

   Church, Manse, Etc.-The manse built in 1730;
and has since been several times repaired.  The church, it is
believed, was built before the Reformation.  The stipend con-
sists partly of victual, and partly of money; and, including
the glebe, which measures from 5 to 6 acres, may amount
annually to about L. 100.  The right of patronage is in the fa-
mily of Loudoun.

   At the town-head of Machlin, on the green, there is a tomb-
stone, with engravings; from which it appears, that in 1685,
under the unhappy reign of James VIII. of Scotland, five men
were put to death there.  Under their names, there are the
following verses in the language of those times:

     " Bloody Dumbarton, Douglass, and Dundee,
     " Moved by the devil, and the Laird of Lee,
     " Dragg'd these five men to death with gun and sword,
     " Not suffering them to pray, nor read God's word;
     " Owning the work of God was all their crime;
     " The eighty-five was a faint-killing time."

     The hole where the gibbet was fixed is still visible.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-There are two great turnpike
roads which cross one another at Machlin; one from Ayr
to Edinburgh, the other from Kilmarnock to Dumfries.
-The river Ayr runs through this parish from east to
west about a mile south of Machlin.  In its course, there are
several great works carried on at present; to wit, an iron
work at Muirkirk, and a cotton-mill at Cattrine.-Over
this river, there are several useful bridges near Machlin, par-
ticularly the new-bridge at Barskimming; built by the late
Sir Thomas Miller.  It excels all the bridges of the county in
beauty and elegance, and is one the greatest curiosities to be
