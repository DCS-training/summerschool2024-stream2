profess to allow to their minister the same sum, without a house
and garden. However it may be at present, a few years ago tbe
members were unable, or unwilling, to raise that sum; and the
minister, who is since dead, having obtained a grant of any collec-
tions which might be made at an evening service, was supported,
in a great measure, by the voluntary contributions of members of
the Established church, who attended that service and pitied his
case. The Relief minister is understood to have L. 60 per an-
num allowed to him; whilst all that can be said of the emoluments
of the Congregational or Independent minister is, that they must
be miserably poor. Amongst the Glassites, Bereans, and Baptists,
the ministerial service is gratuitously performed. From the fore-
going statement it will be seen, that none of the livings, whether
in or out of the Establishment, are great. And it may be noticed
in passing, that, within the period of a very few years, three dis-
senting ministers have been literally starved out of the town by
their congregations.
	The following tables will serve to exhibit the classification of
the inhabitants of the parish, according to their religious profes-
sion, and are the result of actual enumeration. The first table,
exhibiting the state of religious profession in the year 1823, in-
cludes not only the parish of Arbroath, but the suburbs also in
St Vigeans parish. The other tables, which exhibit the state of
religious profession in 1831, refer to the parish of Arbroath only.
