their tenements of land, granting leases, and giving encouragement
to schools. Churches and school-houses have been hitherto much
neglected.

                THE REV. FINLAY M`RAE, MINISTER.

     I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
  Name.-THE term Uist may be distinctly traced to the word
Vist, which the Danes and other northern nations are said to. use,
signifying the west.
  Extent, &c.- The length of North Uist is about, 30 unies,
and its breadth varies from 8 to 14 miles. The exact number
of square miles it contains, it is not easy very accurately to ascer-
tain, the greater part of it being, beyond description, indented by
arms of the sea and fresh water lakes.
  North Uist lies nearly in the middle of the range of islands from
the But, or northernmost point of the Lewis to Barra Head, the
southernmost part. This range taken together is denominated the
Long Island.
  Boundaries.-It is bounded on the north-east by the Sound of
Harris, varying in breadth from I to 8 miles, and which separates.
it from the parish of the same name; on the southeast, by the
Minch, or a channel of about 16 miles breadth, which divides it
from Skye; on the south-west, it is divided from Benbecula, a part
of the parish of South Uist, by sands of some extent, passable on
foot at low-water, but covered by the sea at about half-tide; and
on the north-west, by the Atlantic Ocean,
  Topographical Appearances.-Its figure is almost triangular.
Along-the east coast, there is a range of hills, scarcely deserving.
the name of mountains, rising gradually from the north to the
south, and varying in height from 300 to above 700 feet. These
are -intersected, not by ravines, valleys, and rivulets, but hy inlets.
