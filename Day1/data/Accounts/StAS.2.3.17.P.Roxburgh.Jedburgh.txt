   Manufactures.-The principal manufactures are blankets, flan-
nels, tartans, shawls, shepherd's plaidings, hosiery, lamb's wool
yarn, and carpets, for which between 300 and 400 hands are con-
stantly employed. In the woollen manufacturies, the, usual time of
labour for men, women, and children, may be stated at from ten to
twelve hours daily. In the mills, the time of labour is fixed by the
masters; it was shortened about twenty years ago, long hours being
found unprofitable to the employer, and injurious to the labourer.
The wages are fully equal to what is given for similar work in other
parts of the country, but are by no means a fair remuneration to
those who are employed in these manufactories. here are also
an iron and brass foundery, and an establishment for the manufac-
ture of printing presses, conducted by Mr Hope, the inventor, under
a patent, for which twenty hands are constantly employed. The
occupations, both at the mills and at the foundery, are remarkably
healthy, no instance having occurred of any individual being obliged
to withdraw, on account of ill health contracted at these establish-
ments. The effect on morals is not so favourable. Children enter-
ing at the age of nine, only partially instructed in reading, have
little opportunity of acquiring religious knowledge.
   Associations.-There is a farmers' club for promoting the im-
provement of stock, and of agriculture. The Roxburghshire Hon-
ticultural Society meets at Jedburgh once a-month, commencing
with April, and terminating with September, where prizes are
awarded to successful competitors for flowers, fruit, vegetables, &c.

   Market-Town.-The only market-town in the parish jedburgh,
a royal borough, the county town of Roxburghshire, the seat of a
presbytery, and of a Circuit Court of Justiciary. It is governed
by a council, consisting of a provost, four bailies, a dean of guild,
and eighteen ordinary councillors. There are eight incorporated
trades, who annually elect their own deacons and office-bearers,
and four of these deacons are admitted into the council to repre-
sent the trades for the year. It unites with Haddington, North
   ROXBURGH.                  B
