ed on the best pastures may draw 3 L. or 3 L. 3 s. per head,
ordinary cattle from 2 L. to 2 L. 10 s. whilst others at their
prime are scarcely worth 1 L.  It is but of late years that the
prices have risen even so high.  An ordinary cow, sold at
Martinmas for slaughter, fetches in the country 2 L.  Its beef
will not fill a barrel, and its tallow seldom exceeds 1/2 stone;
but the meat is fat and delicious.
   The number of sheep, considering that there is none of
the farms altogether laid out as a sheep walk, is great.  Few
of them are domesticated.  They range unherded through
the mountains and commons, where many of them are allow-
ed to run wild, uncaught for years.  Under there circum-
stances it is not easy to ascertain their number with any de-
gree of precision.  Perhaps we may not be much above the mark
by calculating it at 11,000.  They are of so diminutive a
size, that 10 or 11 carcases are required to pack a barrel;
and 16 fleeces go to a stone of wool.  The wool is generally
short, but very fine.  The mutton is perhaps the most deli-
cate of its kind in the known world.  The price of a sheep
and lamb at Whitsunday is 3 s. 4 d.; the price of a full grown
wedder or fat sheep at Martinmas is from 3 s. to 3 s. 6 d.
The price of wool, (which is but seldom sold,) is 8 s. the
stone unwashed, or 10 s. when washed.  It is remarkable,
that there has been but little variation in these several prices
for 50 years back.  All the wool is spun and manufactured
in the parish.  A few fine light stuffs are made, which are
worn by the first rank of the inhabitants; the lower ranks
get their wool manufactured into coarse, but decent clothing
for themselves.  Some of the gentlemen are now introduc-
ing the Galloway black-faced breed of sheep to their farms,
which will no doubt increase the quantity of wool and flesh;
but it is much to be doubted, whether the quality of either
will be improved by the experiment.
