         or ravenous animals to a small brood, combined with the vigilance
         of the shepherds, their numbers are kept within limits.
	  The ptarmigan, which frequents only the highest hills, is found
         on the top of Benchonzie.  The moors abound in black and red
	grouse, plover and dotterel.  The woodcock and snipe are fre-
	quently shot.  Partridges are plentiful on the low grounds, and
	the plantations are well stocked with pheasants, which were intro-
	duced at a comparatively late period.  The aquatic birds which
	visit the parish in the course of their migrations, the principal are,
	wild geese, wild ducks, teals, widgeons, gulls, herons, &e.  The
	Plantations are enlivened by the melody of the various species of
	birds of song; and the other varieties of the winged tribe, which
	usually breed in a well-wooded dhstrict, are common.

         shewn, by, the landed proprietors, horticulture has of late made
         very considerable progress, and the several kinds of pot-herbs and

         are now raised by all classes. Along the north side of the Earnt

         for improvement, by planting in their gardens fruit trees of various
	kinds; and as apples, pears, plums, and cherries of different sorts
