greatly hurt oats while the juices in the ear are watery, there
were several contiguous fields sown with late seed oats, whole
best ripened grains were no further advanced than the un-
dermost grains in the field above mentioned, and they all ri-
pened very well, though equeally exposed to the frost.

   Dr Roebuck's exeperiments on oats in 1782 corresponds
with this observation; for, even the last parcel he cut was
not ripe when cut; of course, it may be probably conjectured,
that, in the time of the frost, none of the oats in question
had thick milk in the ear.

   Crops cut and stacked before the frost are safe except
pease, the upper surface of which will frost till they be tho-
roughly ripe.  To save them, it is usual to turn the exposed
side downwards, to thaw gradually before sun-rise.

   This frost affects only low grounds, and only hardens a
very thin crust on the surafce of the earth.  In 1782, the
frost penetrated several inches into the ground, so as to de-
stroy the roots of the potatoes.

   Diseases.-A man called William Badie, or Beatie, a shoe-
maker, died a few weeks ago in Linton.  About 16 or 17
years since, being afflicted with stomach complaints, contrac-
ted by drinking cold water when overheated in harvest, he
was advised to swallow stones to help digestion, after the
manner of birds with muscular stomachs.  He was ever after
afflicted with violent stomach complaints, and frequent vo-
mitings, with a long train of nervous symptoms.  He never
suspected that the stones had lodged in his stomach, till hap-

his head and body reclined downwards, supporting him-
