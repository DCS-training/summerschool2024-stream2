   Population.-The increase of population in this parish is
very great.  The present incumbent was settled in the year
1759.

<TABLE>

The number of souls, at that time, was about             600
In the year 1774, it rose to                            1026
And in this year, 1792, it amounts to                   1250
Which, in the period of 33 years, is an increase of      650
The increase, within these 40 years, however, is only    486
The return to Doctor Webster, in the year 1755, being    764

   This increase is not occasioned by the establishing of
manufactures, as there are none in the parish; but is owing to
a philanthropic plan, adopted by some of the proprietors, of
letting out a considerable part of their lands in small posses-
sions.  And there is a probability, that the parish may still in-
crease, as a village is erecting at the bridge of Earn, which,
from its situation, promises in time to become considerable.
The following is a lift of marriages, &c. for the last eleven
years.
