from Rum, and is about 4 computed miles long, and one
broad.  Isle Muck lies about 4 miles W S. W. from the
nearest part of Eigg is between 2 and 3 miles in length, and
one in breadth.  This island is called in Guels, Eillean nan
Machd, which, literally translated, is, Island of Swine; hence
Isle Muck, and Buchanan very property calls it Insula Por-
corum.

   Appearance.-The island of Eigg is partly flat, but princi-
pally hilly and rocky.  The hills are covered with heath,
which, in some places, is mixed with coarse grass.  Its low
grounds are partly deep partly shallow, and tolerably pro-
ductive, where there is a depth of soil.  Rum is in general
hilly, mountainous, and rocky, much fitter for pasture than
crop.  Canna is partly high, and partly low ground, the high
good for pasture, and the low for crop lsle Muck is pretty
low, excepting one hill of no considerable height; its soil is
in general good.  The height of the Rum hills alone seems
worthy of notice, but for want of proper instruments, it can-
not at present be ascertained.  Of these the summits are al-
most wholly rocky and barren.

   Vegetable and Animal Productions.-The parish produces,
barley, oats, potatoes, flax, kails, and a few other garden
stuffs in small quantities.  In Canna, great oats answer pret-
ty well; on Eigg, the cultivation of this grain has been at-
tempted for two years past, but did not succeed.  After it
comes to the ear, it is lodged, and great part of it rots on
the ground, owing to the frequent and heavy falls of rain.
On barley and small oats, the rain has often a similar effect,
though not to an equal degree.  It is with reason believed,
that green crops would answer better.  The crop seldom af-
fords the inhabitants a competent subsistence.  For several
