battle of Fentenoy. The estate continued in their family till 1758,
when it was sold to David Gavin, Esq.
   Antiquities.-On the hill near Raecleugh-head, the traces of
two military stations still remain. The ditches, are very entire, and
belonged, it is thought, to a Danish encampment. The traces of
another encampment are also to be seen on the moor near Choice-
Lee, where a regiment was stationed after the rebellion of 1715 to
keep the Jacobites in awe. The place is still called Camp-Muir.
   In 1792, when removing a large cairn from the top of the Crum-
stane-hill, close to the site of the present church, several earthen
urns of various sizes were discovered. They contained human bones,
but bore no inscription. Stone coffins were also found on the farms
of Middlefield and Crease, one of which was 3 1/2 feet long, 2 deep,
and 2 1/2 broad. In 1813, a bracelet of gold was found in a small
stream at the Battle-Muir. It measured nine inches in circum-
ference, and was sold for L. 36.

   The following is a state of the population at different periods
when a census was taken:

   Some extensive improvements on the grounds at Langton House,
begun since the census of 1831, by affording occupation for more
workmen, may in part account for the increased population of 1833.
   The average number of births for the last seven years, as en-
tered in the parish register, is 9 3/7. Dissenters do not commonly
register the births of their children.
   The village of Gavinton contains 243 inhabitants. The rest of
the population live on the various farms.
