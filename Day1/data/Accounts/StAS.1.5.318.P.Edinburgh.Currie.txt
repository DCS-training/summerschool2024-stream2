     Statistical Account

   Poor.-The poor of this parish are not very numerous,
amounting generally to 28 or 29, who receive a supply a-
dapted to the exigencies of their case.  The funds for that
purpose are very good.  They consist of a capital of near
L. 500 Sterling, which has been gradually accumulating,
without any special donation worth mentioning*.  What
is much to the credit of the present heritors, rather than
allow this fund to be encroached upon, where particular
exigencies have demanded a more than ordinary supply in
bad seasons, they have readily advanced the money need-
ed from their own pockets, and after the annual resources
of the parish, which amount to L. 50 Sterling, could af-
ford to repay them, they have generously refused a re-
turn.  The yearly mortality is from 21 to 25, and the
yearly baptisms, which, from the number of Seceders,
cannot be so exactly ascertained, amount to about 34 or
35, and are even increasing.

   Longevity.-This parish can boast, perhaps, as much as
any in Scotland, of the longevity of its inhabitants+.  A-
bout a year ago, died William Napier, a day labourer, at
the advanced age ot 113, and till a few years, 5 or 6 at
most, before his death, he followed his usual employment.
He remembered perfectly well several circumstances at
the time of the Revolution in 1688, the accession of Queen
Anne, etc.  At present there is alive one William Rit-

*The chief part of this fund was raised during the incumbency of the
two former clergymen, Messrs Park and Moubray, who being the most
popular preachers of the time, drew after them a vast concourse of people
from the neighbouring parishes, and thus raised the weekly collections to
double their natural amount.

+The late clergyman (Mr Craig) had been no less than 40 years
minister of the parish.
