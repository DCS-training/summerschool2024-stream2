ters is 6 s. per ton.  The British duty about 1 s. 2 d. per
chaldron.  The duty by the Irish Parliament 8 d. per ton,
Additional duty or tax laid on by the Lord Mayor of Dublin
for paving the streets, etc. 1 s. 2 d.  The price in the
Dublin market is fluctuating; never below 16 s. per ton
seldom above 20 s.; sometimes it rises to 30 s.; and last
winter, when the ships were kept in their ports by more than
two months of westerly storms, it rose to 36 s. per ton.  The
quantity of Ayrshire coal imported into the north of Ireland
bears but a small proportion to what they receive from
Whitehaven.  The coal ships-return here from Dublin in
balast.  Except some very trifling articles of provision, they
bring home the value of their cargoes in hard guineas.

   Salt.-The dross or rubbish of the coal, mixed with a little
good round coal, is used for making salt.  The same stuff is
employed to heat their steam engines, and to burn lime,
and is sold for the last purpose at half price.  A new salt-
pan was erected about two years ago:  They talk of build-
ing two more.  At present there are four, all contiguous to
the harbour, with a large reservoir, which, however, unless
during the heat of summer, is of little service in strengthen-
ing or evaporating the sea-water.  Though the pans are five
miles distant from the mouth of the two large rivers; yet,
during a track of rainy or of dry weather, there is a very
considerable difference in the strength of the water, and con-
sequently in the quantity of salt made from it.
