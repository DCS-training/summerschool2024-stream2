into excellent repair, owing to the conversion of the statute
labour of the farmers and househoulders into a pecuniary

new and neat building, standing on the summit of the old
Kirkhill, on the side of Dryfe, contiguous to the old church-
yard, in an open part of the country, and is the most conspi-
cuous and beauteous situation in Annandale, commanding a
