nifying a valley or plain between two hills, was anciently
possessed by the clan Grant; whether they quitted it volun-
tarily or otherwise, is immaterial as well as uncertain; but
it would appear they went from thence to Strathspey, and
called the names of their new possessions after those they inha-
bited in Stratherrick.  Thus we still find the names of Del-
chapple, Garthbeg, and Garthmore, etc. in both these coun-
tries.  Before the year 1545 the united parish seems to have
been occupied by the tribes called Macgruers, Macimesheirs,
and Mactavishes, then followers of the Lovat family; but the
principal persons of all these tribes having accompanied the
Lord Lovat in his expedition to settle the heir of the Clan-

A few years before this period, a son of Lovat had settled
at Foyers, and at same time acquired the property of the
lands of Aberchalder in Abertarf.  And the lineal descend-
ant of another of Lovat's sons settled at Farraline, situated
by a lake of that name in Stratherrick.-At the above con-
flicts Farraline was slain, and Foyers so dangerously wound-
ed, that he was carried from the field of battle by one Nor-
man Gow, on his back, to the top of Suichuimanin, about
