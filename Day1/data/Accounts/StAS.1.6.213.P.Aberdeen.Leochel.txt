low the church of Alford, 27 miles west from Aberdeen.
These abound in fine trout; and, in the water of Leochel,
salmon are seen in the spawning season.
   The general appearance of the parish is hilly; but none of
the hills are high except the hill of Corse.  All of them are cover-
ed with heather; and some abound in game of various kinds.
Hares are very numerous.

   Climate, Soil, Produce, etc.-The climate is healthy; and
many of the natives live to a good old age, notwithstanding
the dampness and wetness of the low grounds.-The princi-
pal distempers are those of the scrophulous kind, consumption,
gravel, and rheumatism.-The soil where the ground is
low is a strong clay, and uncommonly free of stones.  The
high arable land is a good mellow soil of a fine grey colour.
When properly manured and laboured, both produce good
crops.  The dry ground answers well with liming and watering.
The country in general is rather late, especially when a rainy
spring retards the sowing.  The sown grass answers well; but,
where the ground is wet, the red clover soon wears out.  The
natural grass on the low grounds, by the sides of the rivulets,
is exceedingly good.  The farmers sow corn and bear, a-few
pease, and seldom any wheat.  Some potatoes are also planted;
and the people begin to sow small pieces of ground with grass
and turnips, the advantages of which they are sensible of.  In
a few years, it is hoped, they will be more reconciled to that
practice.-The inhabitants live upon meal, potatoes, tur-
nips, and greens, seldom using any flesh.  They have fowls,
butter, and cheese in abundance.

   Agriculture and Rent.-The people in general are not very
industrious; and are far from the means of improving their
ground.  No marle of any kind has been found in the parish;
