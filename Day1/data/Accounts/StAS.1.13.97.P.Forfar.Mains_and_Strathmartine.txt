consequently not very famous for cattle; what is called the
runridge being common in every quarter of it; but since
the runridge was abolished, improvements have gone on
with spirit.  Oxen of a large size have been introduced
by the heritors, for the plough and wain.  Horses which
were bought twenty years ago from L. 7 to L. 12, now
cost from L. 15 to . 25.  A considerable number of cat-
tle, since turnips began to be raised, have been fed, and
sold not only by the heritors, but also by the farmers.
Calves have begun to be reared in abundance, for the mar-
ket, and farmers use.  No sheep are kept in the parish, ex-
cept a few for private use, though formerly almost every
farmer had a stock.  The ground produces good oats, bar-

brought to Dundee by water, marl from the mires of
Auchterhouse parish, and composts of dung and earth.
There are some excellent stone quarries in the parish.

   Water, Bridges and Mills.-The rivulet, commonly called
Dighty water, which has its sources in Lundie parish, and
runds into the frith of Tay, glides through the middle of this
parish.  Some fine burn-trouts, and a few pikes and perches
of a middle size, are to be found in it; they abound most
in spring, but are never caught for sale.  By the exertions
of that public spirited gentleman, David Laird of Strath-
martin, 2 bridges have been thrown over Dighty, one on the
road leading from Glammis to the Carse of Gowry, and the
other on the road from Sidlaw-hill to Dundee.  A bridge has
likewise been built of late over Dighty, to the eastward, at
the expense of the corporation of bakers in Dundee.  There
are 10 mills in the parish; 2 corn mill, 1 flour, 1 barley,
and 1 fulling mill, in the interest of Captain Laird.  On
Mr Ogilvie's estate, there is 1 corn, 1 fulling, and 1 lint
