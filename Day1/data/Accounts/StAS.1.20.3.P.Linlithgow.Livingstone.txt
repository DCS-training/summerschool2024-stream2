     of Livingstone.

   Population.-In 1755 the population of this parish is sta-
ted at 598; about 25 years ago it was considerably dimi-
nished by the dismission of a number of small tenants, and
letting their possessions in larger farms to others; but this
loss was in some degree compensated, by an acquisition of
industry and spirit for improvement, and the population is
again upon the increase.  At the period last above men-
tioned, the inhabitants of the parish, including all ages, were 
reduced to about 300, at present they are considerably above
400.  The following table of baptisms and burials, for a pe-
riod of 7 years, prior to the 1794, affords a comfortable
proof of this fact.

   Villages.-There are two villages in this parish, one, the
Kirktown of Livingstone, contaning about 40 inhabitants;
and the other, lately built upon the estate of Blackburn,
upon seus from Mr Moncrieff, and which contains near 200
people.  But there are no manufactures of any kind carried
on in either, excepting that a water-mill, to drive machinery
for carding and spinning cotton, has lately been erected at
the latter village, which, it is to be hoped, will be of use,
by employing at least a part of the inhabitants.
