Privy Council, by the Lieutenancy of the country, upon
the 29th day of September last, 45 men from this parish,

Militia Act.

   Schools.-The public schools of Banff, which are entirely
under the direction of the Magistrates, (for there is no pa-
rochial establishment), were connected together, and con-
verted into an academy, in the year 1786.  The several
arrangements in this academy were made, and the teachers
recommended by Dr George Chapman*, formerly rector
of the Grammar-school at Dumfries, and who for some
years superintended the establishments for education in this
place.
   The plan of instruction which Dr Chapman laid down
has been strictly adhered to by the different teachers, and
has answered the expectations of all concerned.  The semi-
nary is at present in a flourishing state.
   At the annual public examination in August 1797, the
number of daily scholars amounted to 180.
   The following branches of education are taught in this
academy, by the head master and four assistants:
I. The Classics, Latin and Greek, with geography, and
the principles of rhetoric.
II. Writing, arithmetic, bookkeeping, mensuration, al-
gebra, practical geometry, and navigation.
III. The French and English Languages, &c.
