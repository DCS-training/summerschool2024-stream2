     Statistical Accont

   Threshing machines are coming fast into use.  One of
these threshes eight threaves or sixteen stooks in the
hour, and may be wrought by one good horse.  It threshes
perfectly clean, and by these means is reckoned to obtain one
boll more in twenty, than is done by the stail.  The expence
of the machinery is less than 20 L.-There are two persons em-
ployed in constructing these machines, within a mile of the
place*.
   About ten acres are covered with a natural oak wood.  A-
bout 40 acres were began to be planted with different species
of forest trees about the year 1715.  The larix has throve par-
ticularly well.  Six trees of this species had been planted in
1735, in some openings that had been lest in the grove, be-
hind the house of Blairdrummond, that was planted in 1715,
and they now overtop greatly all the other trees.-One of them
was cut lately, it measured 66 feet in length, and contained
134 feet of wood, reckoned equally good in quality as foreign
fir.  The five trees remaining contain 550 feet of wool.-
About 70 acres have been planted in the course of the last 25
years.
   It will not be doubted that the larch occupies a considerable
share.  It is found to be the best methond to plant it without
any mixture of other trees, or at least without any dependence
upon them for shelter, for, as it grows so much quicker than
any, even of the fir or pine species, it is liable to bend towards
the N.E. unless sheltered by others.

<FOOTNOTE>

*Wheat is sown commonly in the last week of August, and the two first of
September, beans sometimes in February, but generally in the last half of
March, and first half of April, barley in the last week of April, and the first
week of May.
   The barley and wheat harvest begins ordinarily in the middle of August.
and that of aots and beans about the beginning of September.
