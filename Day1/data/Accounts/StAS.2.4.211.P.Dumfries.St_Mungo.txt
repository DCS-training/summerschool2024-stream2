per annum. Eleven proprietors possess each a rental of L.50
and upwards.
	Character and Habits of the People.--The people are indus-
trious, frugal, and generally temperate. The virtue of cleanliness
in their persons and houses is daily gaining ground. They enjny
a fair share of the comforts of life, and, not meddling with poli-
tics, they are quite contented with their condition. Their ordi-
nary food is oatmeal, potatoes, and the produce of a small garden,

<FOOTNOTE>Castlemilk, originally built by the Bruces, came into the family of Stewart by
the marriage of Walter High Steward of Scotland with one of King Robert's
daughters. It fell by marriage into the family of Maxwells of Nithsdale, and was sold
by that family. Whilst a furtified place, it was besieged by the Duke of Somerset, pro-
tector during the minority of Edward the Sixth. The Usurper during the common-
wealth besieged this place; against his arms it stood out a considerable time. Hav-
ing passed through so many proprietors since the original family took up their resi-
dence on their property near Glasgow, now named after this ancient place, the very
ghost which used to disturb the slumbers of the Stewarts and Maxwells now slum-
bers in the burial aisle of the church.
    One tenant at present rents a single farm, which not many years since gave em-
ployment to six tenants and their families.
