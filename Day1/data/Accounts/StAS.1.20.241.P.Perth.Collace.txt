     of Collace.

   Antiquities.-The most noted remains of antiquity, is Mac-
beth's Castle, on Dunsinnan hill, in the south-east corner of
the parish.  This remarkable hill is insulated, and of an
oval form, with a flat and verdant summit.  The assent,
from the village of Collace, on the north-west, is gradual;
and there some vestiges of a winding road may still be tra-
ced.  On all other sides, the hill is steep, and of difficult ac-
cess.  It is separated from the east , by a narrow
valley, covered with verdure.  The area on which the fort
flood, being 168 yards in length, 100 in breadth near the
east, and 55 near the west extremity, was anciently envi-
roned by a wall of stone, without cement.  The entrance
into the fort was at the north-east corner of the area.  Tho'
no trace of the fort now appears, yet, it is probable, that
the foundation is entire, as the building was consumed by
fire.  It must, therefore, be the ardent with of every anti-
quarry, that this spot were thoroughly explored.  Several
years ago, some gentlemen, in digging a pit near the middle
of the area, discovered pieces of the bones of animals, brick,
and burnt corn.  At a remote period, this was, no doubt,
one of the stations whence signals, on any alarm, were made
by fire.  The story of the Userper's defeat, flight northward,
adn death at Lumphanan, is known to every reader conver-
fant in the history of Scotland.
