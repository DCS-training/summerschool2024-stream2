land, and supported many thousand people; greatly pro-
moted improvements in agriculture; and may be consider-
ed among the most laudable, important, and beneficial
works for the good of the country, that have ever been un-
dertaken in this part of the kingdom.-Ironstone is found
in the lands belonging to Sir Charles Halket, Baronet.  Of
this material there are two seams at a small distance from
each other.  The uppermost is 4 inches, and the lowermost
2 1/2 inches thick.  Being above a seam of coal, they are 
wrought along with it.  They are of an excellent quality
for making cannon, and have been exported to the Carron
Company for that purpose.  The ironstone began to be
wrought by that Company in 1771, and in 1773 and 1774,
there were 60 miners, and as many bearers employed in
the mines.  Since that period, the ironstone has been
wrought by the tacksmen of the coal.-Coal is also found
in great abundance in almost every part of this parish.  The
coal mines of this parish are the most ancient in Scotland.
The earliest account of coal used as fuel,  is a charter of
William de Oberwill, in which he granted liberty to the
Abbot and Convent of Dunfermline to open a coal-pit
wherever they inclined, excepting on his arable land, and 
permitted them to take as much as was necessary for their
own use, and to open a new mine whenever the old was
exhausted; but not to fell any part of it to others.  The
charter is dated at Dunfermline, on the Tuesday immedi-
ately before the feast of St Ambrose 1291*.  But at that early
