   Mills.-There are two lint-mills in the parish, and four
corn-mills, for grinding.  There are three mills erected in
the parish for threshing corn.  Each mill is driven by three
or four horses.  It threshes a boll in ten more out of wheat
than is done by flails.  But the mill breaks the wheat-straw
much, and unfits it for thatch.  The expence of mounting
one is L. 30 or L. 40 Sterling.  One of these has about 80
revolutions of the threshing-drum for one revolution of the
horse's wheel.  But as the horse's tract is eight times lar-
ger than the circumference of the threshing-drum, the
threshers move with only ten times the velocity of the
horses.  There mills give satisfaction.

   Rent and Produce.-The whole rent of the parish is
L. 2467 Sterling.  The crop and annual industry of the
people is worth about four times that sum, little short of
L. 10,000 Sterling.  Of this, one-fourth goes to low the
ground, and furnish implements of husbandry; one-fourth
to pay the rent; one-fourth to pay and maintain the ser-
vants, (men's wages being from L. 10 to L. 13, anti wo-
men's wages L. 4 Sterling); and one-fourth to support the
farmer's family.  Before the farms were divided, and the
late mode of farming adopted, there was only "ane to saw,
"and ane to gnaw, and ane to pay the Laird witha'.  "This
is sometimes the case still.  The stock and tiend of the
whole parish, according to the valuation of the presbytery
of Meigle, A.D. 1630, was 84 chalders 3 bolls 2 pecks of
victual, and L. 3131; 4; 10 Scotch of money; and turning
the money into visual, at L. 100 Scotch the chalder, (which
seems to have been the rule then used in the valuation, the
Whole Rock and tiend, estimated in victual, was 115 chal-
ders.  But the present rent being L. 2467 sterling, would
be equal to 192 chalders, at 16 s. Sterling the boll.  The
