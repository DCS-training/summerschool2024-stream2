   Miscellaneous Observations.-The poor are maintained by
collections at the church-door, and the interest of a paro-
chial fund, arising from several sums of money, mortified by
the family of Dirleton, and by Mrs Carmichael.  There are
at present about 40 on the poor's roll; but there is not one
beggar in the parish belonging to it.  In this part of the
country, coal is the common fuel, either brought by sea, or
from some coal pits which are now wrought in the county.
Near the head-land called Gulan Ness, there was formerly a
ferry-boat, for carrying passengers from East-Lothian to Fife;
this being the nearest land to the Fife coast, of any between
Dunbar and Leith.  The farmers have both servants in their
houses, and cottagers, for the purposes of agriculture.  The
latter are considered to be more steady, and less given to
change; and are generally trusted with some degree of over-
fight in the farm.  The wages of these cottagers, or hinds
as they are here called, is nine bolls of oats, two bolls of
barley, two bolls of pease, a cow maintained summer and
winter; and, if they sow and stack the grain, one firlot of
wheat, and a pair of shoes.  All servants, day-labourers,
hinds, etc. have their diet in harvest.
