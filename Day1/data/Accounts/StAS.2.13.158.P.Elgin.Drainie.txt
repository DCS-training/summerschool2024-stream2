its rise from a very calamitous event which befel the fishing
crews of Stotfield, on Thursday the 25th December 1806,
when no less than 21 seamen lost their lives, leaving 17 widows
and 47 children unprovided for,-besides aged parents, and other
relatives depending for their support on the labours of the deceas-
ed. Collections to the amount of L. 1075, 13s. were received,
land a committee of gentlemen appointed to take charge of the
distribution.  They allamed each widow L. 3, and each child under
fourteen years of age L. 1, 10s. half yearly.  By the deaths of
those originally appointed, the charge devolved on John Jack, Esq.,
merchant in Elgin, to whose accuracy, mildness, and firmness,
in this business, the parish of Drainie is much indebted.  His
record of the annual distributions will be preserve along with the
parochial registers.  From the fall of interest, the. allowance to
the widow bas been, since 1834, reduced to I- 1, 10s. annually.
Only L.35 Sterling remains'at present, and, after a lapse of thirty-
two years, there are still eight of -the widows surviving.

as much as possible below 40.  The sick, infirm, and aged only
are put on the permanent list.  Few in the rural district claim
sessional aid; but in the villages of Lossiemouth and Stotfield, the
number would be tripled, if. all who asked relief obtained it.
Were applications for relief from all disposed to make them, lis-
tened to, the rental of the parish in a short time would not -suffice
to satisfy the demands.  The average annual amount of church
