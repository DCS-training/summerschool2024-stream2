bolls a-year, formerly obtained from Gilmerton; but since the coal-
work there was discontinued, from Sir George Clerk's works at
Loanhead.
Sandstone Quarries.--There is an  excellent and valuable quarry
at Niddry, but the working of it is at present suspended, except
for purposes connected with the estate.  There is also abundance
of excellent freestone at Craigmillar, but lately the quarry was
shut up.  It was worked very extensively whilst the building mania
raged in Edinburgh; and George's Square, the Regent's Bridge,
and the greater proportion of the south districts of Edinburgh were
built from it, as were also the barracks at Jock's Lodge.
The quarry at Straiton is in operation. The stone is good, and
the annual produce is stated to be L.40.  A beautiful yellow sand,
of considerable value, is also excavated at Gilmerton.

the only village worth naming is Gilmerton, which contained late-

1100.
Means of Communication.--There is here a penny post-offic

excellent roads.  The London, Dumfries, Musselburgh, and Dal-
