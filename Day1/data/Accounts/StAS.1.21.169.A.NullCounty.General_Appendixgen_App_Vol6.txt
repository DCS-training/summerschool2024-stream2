feet, and the water-course 10 feet broad.  It commences at
the termination of the pipes; from whence extending above
1400 yards, it discharges the water into a canal formed for
its reception on the surface of the moss.
   For raising the water to this height there were two rea-
sons.  1st, That not only where it was delivered on the moss,
but even after being conveyed to the most distant corners,
it might still retain sufficient power to transport the moss to
the river Forth.  2dly, That reservoirs of a sufficient height
might be formed in the moss to retain the water delivered
during night.
   In consequence of Mr Whitworthh's advice, a contract was
entered into with Mr Meikle in spring 1787; and by the
end of October in that year, the wheel, pipes, and aque-
duct, were all completely finished: and what, in so complex
and extensive an undertaking, is by no means common, the
different branches of the work were so completely executed,
and so happily adjusted to each other, that upon trial the ef-

pence exceeded 1000 L. sterling.
   To induce the proprietor to embark in this undertaking,
the moss tenants had of their own accord previously come
under a formal engagement to pay the interest of any sum
that might be expended in procuring a supply of water.  But
he was determined they should not enjoy by halves the sweets
of this long-wished-for acquisition.  With a view, therefore,
not only to reward their past industry, but to rouse them to
future exertions, he at once set them free from their engage-

   This new supply was a most acceptable boon to the moss
tenants.-In order to make an equitable distribution, the
water raised through the day was allotted to one division of
operators; that raised during the night to another.  To re-
