     (COUNTY OF LINLITHGOW.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES PATON.

     Name, Situation, Surface, Minerals, etc.

   Torphichen is said to signify 'ten hills;' a range of hills
having so many particular tops being immediately in the
vicinity of the village of Torphichen.  The parish is situa-
ted in the presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian
and Tweeddale, about 17 miles W. of Edinburgh, in lati-
tude 55 degree 55' about 9 miles in length from E. to W. and
its average breadth about 2 1/2.  It is bounded on the S. part-
ly by the parish of Bathgate, and partly by Shotts; on the
W. partly by Shotts and New Monkland; on the N. by Sla-
mannan and Muiravenside; and on the E. by Linlithgow.  The
parish is hilly in general, but particularly so at the E. end,
where the hill called Cairn Naple is situated, the height of
which above the level of the sea is 1498 1/4 feet.  The parish
may be reduced into two districts; the E. end, extending about
4 miles, is in most parts very fertile, except the hilly parts.
The west end is what is commonly called moor-land.  The
air, in general, is moister than farther east the county, but
