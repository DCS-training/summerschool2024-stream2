on water born coal, which is above the sixth part of the
price, this country moreover feels the partiality of the
tax on Scots coal carried north of the Redhead, of which it

before they can begin to unload; by which a delay of three days, besides
much expense, is unnecessarily incurred.  But no inconvenience could
result from a deputation to proper officers at Elgin; yet the gentlemen of
the country submit to this distress, with a patience and self-denial which
at least does honour to their Christian resignation.
