   Fairs.-There are three annual fairs held within the pa-
rish; one at Kirkmichael, called the Michaelmas market,
and two at the spittal of Glenshee.  The former is of long
standing.  It probably took its use from the concourse of
people who assembled on the day sacred to St Michael, at a
place consecrated to his memory and worship.  From com-
ing together, for the purposes of devotion, they learned to
continue together, for the sake of transacting secular affairs,
till, by degrees, this last object became the chief reason, and
at length the only reason of their assembling.  Michaelmas
came to be a term for settling accompts, and other money
transactions, over all Scotland.  Half a century ago, this
fair was one of the principal cattle markets in the kingdom,
and continued 3 or 4 days, or rather a week together.  Of
late years, it has been much less crowded.  There is a week-
ly market held at Kirkmichael on Fridays, whither the peo-
ple of the neighbourhood repair, to sell what yarn they may
have spun during the week, and to buy their weekly supply
of tobacco, snuff, lamp oil, and other groceries.  Shoemakers
from Athole, dispose of a great many shoes also, at this mar-
ket.  It has been remarked, and perhaps with too much rea-
son, that this market gives encouragement to idleness, and
imprudent, not to say immoral indulgences, by furnishing a
pretence for frequent visits to the village.  Appointments
for praying trisling debts, are commonly made at this market.
The creditor and debtor meet.  They adjourn to the public
house.  After each has drunk his pot, the debtor finds he is
not able to pay his debt.  He craves a week's delay.  The
creditor easily agrees to so short a term.  The appointment
is renewed, and the same scene repeated, perhaps many times,
before the debt is paid.  Thus both time and money are need-
lessly spent, and a habit of idleness and of tipling contracted.
