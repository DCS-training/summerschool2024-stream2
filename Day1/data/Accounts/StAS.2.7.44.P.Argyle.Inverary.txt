                The following table is found in Smith's Statistical Survey of Ar-
              gy1eshire, written in 1798, and which, though it may be consider
              ed not perfectly accurate, as such returns can scarcely be so, af-
              fords a still further view or the difference between the present and
              past condition of this parish. The table in its later details  is only
              to be considered to be as an approximation to the truth.

                Though these changes show some improvement in agriculture,
              much remains to be done. The cottages and farm-buildings are
              generally of a very inferior description, formed of stones without
              lime, and thatched with ferns or sprits. The consequence is,
              they only endure for a few years, require constant repairs, occupy
              the time of the tenant at the season in which be ouabt to be drain-
              ing and preparing his land, and by going into decay, require more
              timber every twenty years from the proprietor than would main-
              tain slated houses for generations.
                The fields are also for the most part undivided, and wrought
              in a slovenly manner, or are undrained and in the state of nature.
              Turnips are little used; potatoes may be said to be the only green
              crop raised, and sown grasses are cultivated only by the higher
              order of tenantry, it being considered useless to attempt to grow
              such on land which is open and liable to be poached by cattle in
              all states of the weather, or soft and marshy, or so limited in quan-
              tity, that what is dry and healthy must be constantly under po-
              tatoes and corn. To remedy these and any other defects in hus-
              bandry, the surest means are to encourage and to improve the con-
              dition of the tenantry. It is only a few years since, that such en-
              couragement has been given to the tenant to drain or fence his
              lands. Now the proprietor encourages the tenants, by opening
              drains which they close, building dikes the stones of which they
              collect, and generally by paying a share of the work done; so that,
              if the progress for the next twenty years shall prove equal to the
              improvements for the eight which have elapsed, all parties will be
              benefited, and the face of the country still further beautified.
