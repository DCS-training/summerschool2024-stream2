     Of Kilfinichen and Kilviceuen.

   To the N. of the abbey is a loch, as it is called, but
probably an artificial pond.  It has a paved causeway*
through the middle, which is still entire.  It is said, the
edges of this pond were all planted.  Poria-chunich
ought to be mentioned.  Here, as tradition goes, was
the place where Columba first landed in I, and left his
currach; from which the place has its name.  An ar-
tificial mound, of the form of a boat with the keel up,
is said to be the dimensions of Columba's currach.  This
mound measures near 50 feet in length.  Upon this
beech the pebbles are got.
   It is said, there was a monastery in the island of Innis-
Kenneth, but no traces of the buildings are to be seen.
A small church, said by Buchanan to be a parish church,
still remains.  What is pretty singular, a small bell, used
at the celebration of mass, is still lying on the altar.
There are in the parish many of the round towers said
to be Danish.  They are upon the sea coast, and in sight
of one another.  They seem to be watch-towers to give
notice of an enemy's approach, which was done from
the battlement by a smoke in the day time, and a fire
at night.  They are very small; most of them would
not contain 20 men.
   There are in many parts of the parish, long stones
standing on end.  They are called Carra+, and seem to
be set up at the head of the graves of eminent men, or
as memorials of some remarkable transactions carried on
in these places.

found a safe retreat, in the sequestered island of Icolm-
