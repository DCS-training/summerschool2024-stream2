<FOOTNOTE>

The average number of baptisms for the last 5 years, is 75; but it would
have been greater, if the parents had been more regular in giving in the names
of the children to the parish-register.  The baptisms for the year 1792, which
were 93, may be depended on as the exact number administered by the Esta-
blished minister, as he baptized none during that period, which were not regis-
tered before ministers who are not of the Establishment.  The average number
of baptisms from 1754 to 1758, both inclusive, is 50.  There has never been any
register of burials kept in this parish.
