   Manufactures and Fishing.-The parish produces a great
quantity of wool, which sells from 10 d. to 15 d. per lispund.
Very little good use is made of it in the parish.  A few
coarse cloths are manufactured for common use; and all the
stockings, nightcaps, mitts, &c. used in the parish.  The
remainder is commonly destoyed in coarse stockings, which
can hardly bring the original value of the wool.  They are
generally bartered in Lerwick for tea, snuff, tobacco, linen,
lawns, cottons, &c. and seldom bring above 2 1/2 d. real value,
though they are nominally allowed 5 d.; for neither meal
nor ready money can be obtained for stockings.  It must,
however, be acknowledged, that the manufacturers are much
to blame for the low price of stockings, as they are generally
of an extreme bad quality.  A considerable quantity of kelp
is made in this parish, perhaps from 40 to 50 tons in a year.
The shores are generally let to a farmer, who makes the kelp
at his own expence, and receives from the landlord 40 s. per
ton.  He employs women or boys at 7 s. 6 d. per months or
2 d. a tide.  This manufacture is but lately introduced, and
is of very essential service, as many people earn something at
it, who never had or could have earned a penny in any other
way.
   The people, in general, have a turn for handicrafts; but,
as they have no opportunity to learn, and but very little
steadiness in themselves, they seldom come to perfection in
any trade.  Every man almost tans his own leather, (often
with the tormentile root), makes his own shoes, coarse cloths,
&c.  There is no convenient fishing Ration in this parish,
nor any beaches sit for drying the fish.  The small part of it
which has immediate access to the ocean, is a bold rocky
shore.  The ling and cod fishing is, however, carried on with
great vigour by the inhabitants, who are not inferior in skill
and activity to any of their neighbours.  In the month of
