     Statistical Account

   Character of the People, Mode of Living, Dress, etc.-
The people of this parish are, in general, honest, peace-
able, and industrious; very charitable to the poor, and,
in cases of distress, very much disposed to acts of hu-

greatest part apply themselves to husbandry, to the sal-

part of the parish next to the sea, and especially of the
town of Garmouth, are much disposed to this last; and
many of them go to sea, and become excellent seamen.
There are about a dozen natives of this place who are

to breakfast; sowens, (that is, a kind of slummery, made
of oat meal, somewhat soured), with milk or beer, to
dinner; and kail, that is, greens or cabbage, boiled with
oatmeal, to supper.  With all these, they use bread of
oat meal, or what is called household meal, that is, some

also, where the post road passes it, would be extremely convenient and useful.
But if one were built over Spey, that over Findhorn would follow of course.
And if there were bridges over those two rivers at the places mentioned, there
would not be one ferry to pass on all the great post road from Queensferry to
the Feiry of Dornach in Sutherland; a circumstance which would be most
conducive to the convenience and comfort of travellers, and to the commerce
and prosperity of the country.
