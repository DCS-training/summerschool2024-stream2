rable success.  This fishing, however, is so very precarious,
that it cannot be supposed a preparation to any degree, be-
yond a trifling amount, will be made for it.  The sprats
are not seen so often as even the herrings.  It is upwards
of 20 years since we had them in great abundance, or it
may be said at all, on this coast.  The herrings and sprats
are best in the months of September, October and No-
vember.

   Hills and Mountains.-The most remarkable hill in this
parish is Tom-na-heurich, near the town, on the west side
of the river.  It is a beautiful insulated mount, nearly re-
sembling a ship, with her keel uppermost.  This hill, in the
year 1753, was inclosed and planted, chiefly with Scotch
firs.  The hill is composed of land and gravel, and before
it was planted, yielded only a short thin heath, and was of
no advantage to the proprietor.  This hill stands on a base,
whole length is 1984 feet, and breadth 176.  The eleva-
tion of the hill, from the channel of the river, is 250.  The
most striking mountains in this parish, form that range on
the west side of the river, which is a continuation of the
great chain, running from Lochlomond to the frith of Tain,
known to antiquaries by the name of Drumalbin, and
which divided the Scottish from the Pictish kingdom.  In
this range, on the summit of a rock, called Craig-Phatrick,
are the remains of a vitrified fort, generally believed to be
Pictish, and if Pictish, probably the remains of the Royal
Seat at Inverness, of which Adamnan, Abbot of Jona,
makes mention in his Life of the celebrated Saint Colum-
ba; hither, as Adamnan relates, the Saint repaired from
Jona, and converted Brudius, the Pictish monarch, to the
Christian faith.  The elevation of Craig-Phatrick from
the river is 1150 feet.
