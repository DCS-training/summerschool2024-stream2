	Thrashing mills are now erected on most of the farms, and, where
	that is practicable, they are driven by water. There are, at pre-
	sent, nine of them in the parish, and five of them are driven by
	water. The first flour mill in. the country was erected in 1821, by
	Mr Sim. It is driven by the water of the Skiack. Besides the
	flour mill, this water drives one weal, two barley, and three saw
	mills. There are also meal, flour, barley, and carding mills on
	the Aultgraad.
 	   Produce.-The average gross amount of raw produce raised in
	the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, may be stated as

	follows:
	Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for the food	of man,
	or the domestic animals,					     L. 882O	0	0
	Of potatoes, turnips, beet, &c					        2400	0	0
	Of grass including natural, pasture, and cultivated grass,	        3600	0	0
	Gardens and orchards,							  60	0	0
	Fisheries,								  10	0	0
	Miscellaneous produce,							 200	0	0

	Total yearly value ofraw produce raised,	                      L.15090   0        0

	  Of course, this can only be regarded as an approximation ; but
	it is believed to be very near the real amount. It is usually cal-
	culated that the gross produce of a property should be thrice the
	rental ; and it will be seen that the above amount bears very near-
	ly that ratio to the estimated real annual value of the land.
	   The valued rent of the whole parish is L. 3149, 9s. 6d. Scots.
	The real value in 1791 was estimated at L. 1500 Sterling; in
	1810, at L.3068, 8s. 5d.; and at present, (1839), it is about
	L. 5300.
	   There is no manufacture carried on to any extent. Even the
	home-made stuffs, which the peasantry used to wear, are now near.
	ly discontinued, as they find it cheaper to purchase than to manu-
	facture them. In manv respects, it is very desirable that a ma-
	nufacture of some kind should be established in the village of
	Evantown, where there are so many unemployed children, who
	might thus be enabled to assist their parents in providing for their
	support.

	   Market-Town, &c.-There is no market-town in the parish;
	and the nearest is Dingwall, at the distance of six miles. There
	is one village, called Evantown containing about 100 houses
	and a population of about 500. This village, which had no
  	existence thirty years ago, is built upon a waste piece of land,
