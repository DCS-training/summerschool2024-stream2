cere regard to morals and propriety of conduct.  If these
things are not carefully attended to, they will evidently, in
the long-run, essentially injure society.

   Schools.-The only description of the inhabitants that are
destitute of the necessary means of subsistence, are our school-
masters, of whom we have two, one in each village, which
are distant 4 English miles.  The salary, it is true, is the
maximum allowed by law, viz. 11 L. 6 s. 8 d., of which 7 L. go
to the schoolmaster at the Abbey, (which is looked upon as
being properly the parish school); and the remaining 4 L. 6 s. 8 d.
to the one at Aucheneairn.  Nothing is more evident, con-

when it is reflected on, that the population is such, that, when
the children are divided between two schools, neither of them
can be numerous; and more especially, when it is con-

farmer can have his child waited upon, and taught English, 6
hours every day, for the sum of 4 d. a month.  This is so glaring
an inconsistency, that, to the honour of some of our proprietors,
to whom it has been shewn, they have declared their readi-
ness to enter into an agreement, with the rest of the heritors,
to supply the defect, by an annual voluntary contribution.  At
the period when the law was enacted with respect to school-
masters, the provision then made for them, bore a suitable
proportion to the other ranks and stations of the community;
but now, in the present altered state of things, it is indisput-

fore most devoutly to be wished, that all persons of influence,
who have a regard to the rising generation, and feel in their
minds a veneration for piety and morals, would unite their
