crimes are seldomer committed here, than in any other parish
of equal population.  The author knows of no native who has
ever been tried for a capital crime.  In short, they are gene-
rally honest, decent, religious, and strict in their attendance
on divine worship.  Perhaps, there may be one or two indivi-
duals, who, either from ignorance, or, from violence of
temper, will not listen to the cool voice of reason, who chime
in with the ravings of the Friends of the People, as they call
themselves; but the rest, although some may wish for a mo-
derate reform, have too much religion and found sense not
to see, that those people have neither experience nor know-
ledge in matters of that nature, and only grasp at seating
themselves in power upon the ruins of their country; nor are
they so weak, as not to profit from the example of a neigh-
bouring kingdom, where Anarchy fits triumphant upon the
guillotine, with Murder at her back, trampling upon law,
liberty, and religion, and treading the rights of mankind
under her feet.
   Ecclesiastical State.  The King is patron of the parish.
Lord Douglas is titular of the teinds of the borough
lands, and Mr Lockhart of Lee and Carnwath of the rest
of the parish.  The church, being built in 1777, is in very
good repair.  The manse and office houses, being erected at
the late incumbent's entry in 1757, are not in such good or-
der.  The manse, offices, and garden, cover about a rood of
ground.  The glebe is scrimply 4 acres; but the incumbent
is entitled to the grass of the church-yard, and to common
pasturage in the moor.
   The stipend payable at present is as under,
