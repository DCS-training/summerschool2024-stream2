they are held on reasonable terms; but how much more so
when the case is often otherwise.  What is this burden?
Why, these tacks subject their possessors to several servi-
tudes, which ought necessarily to be bestowed on their fa-
milies and farms; to expences in labouring, too dispropor-
tionate to the profits they can expect.  They have rents to
pay, a family and servants to support, a horse, an ox, and
cow to buy, any of which may be more than the rent;
and oftentimes their small crops are very much curtailed
by the rapacious hand of the miller, who has every power
and opportunity in his hands to treat them without mercy.
Now, these are things which too small a farm cannot bear,
even though the tenant held it otherwise on reasonable
terms.  They are, at best, but a deceitful kind of wretched-
ness, amusing them with gilded and fallacious hopes, which
reconcile them to their present state, but seduce them into
complete ruin at last.  The meanest servant of such a te-
nant reaps much more from his tack than he does himself.
   Another great evil arising from these too small farms
is, that they are a strong temptation to tradesmen to take
them, whenever they have made a few pence by their
trade, in which they were prosperous before they became
tenants; now, being entrapped into a farm, their families
and their trade rush into ruin at once.  By this means a
good and useful tradesman is lost to the public, or rather
becomes a burden to it.
   There is, further, another evil accompanying these too
small tacks; they entice many from the service to become
tenants, who could have lived more comfortably and use-
fully in their former state.  This is one great reason why
servants are so dear, and so difficult to be got by the far-
mer, or if he gets them, that they are so uninterested and
careless in his service.  From the moment they engage in
