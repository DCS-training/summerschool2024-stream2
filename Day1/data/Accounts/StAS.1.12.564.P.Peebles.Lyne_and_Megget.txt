   On the whole, it will perhaps be found to be the soundest
policy, that no restraint whatever be imposed either upon
farming, commerce, or manufactures.  When left to themselves,
they will have a strong mutual influence on each other, and
though one of them may appear to gain too great an ascend-
ancy at a time, yet it will soon be checked by the others, and
descend to its own proper level.  When Government is so
wife as not to interfere in these matters, it will find its advan-
tage in the increasing prosperity of the whole state.

   Antiquities.-About 1 of a mile W. of Lyne church, there
is a famous Roman camp of about 6 acres in extent.  The
situation of it appears to have been chosen with great judg-
ment.  The road leading to it is still visible, and runs through
the present glebe.  The ground within the encampment has
been frequently ploughed, and it is said, that Roman coins,
etc. were frequently found in it.  But as this camp has been
often described, it is judged unnecessary to insist more on it.
In Megget there are the remains of 2 old towers, which ap-
pear to have been built, partly for defence, partly for accom-
modating the Kings of Scotland when on their hunting par-
ties in the forest.  The traces of 3 or 4 roads in different di-
rections across the hills are still visible, at what period, or
with what design they were formed, is uncertain.  Perhaps
when the country was covered with wood, they were cut out
fot the King and his suite when they went a-hunting.  At
Henderland, there are the remains of an old chapel and bury-
ing-ground.  The inscription on the tomb-stone of the famous
freebooter, Cockburn of Henderland, is still legible.  Boetius,
Buchanan, and other historians, inform us, the gold was for-
merly found in Glengaber water, and some small traces still
remain of the ground which had been dug in search of that
precious metal.
