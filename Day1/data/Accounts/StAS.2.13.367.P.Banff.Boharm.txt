             its noble situation on the bank of the Spey, in a recess of Benagen,
             which rises steep on three sides crowned with wood, having the river
             in front spreading out into a broad pool, with the fine plains and ris-
             ing woodlands of Rothes on the opposite bank, and the lofty Bel-
             innes closing the prospect at five or six miles distance.  Auch-
             lunkart House is a most commodious mansion, on the plea-
             sant bank of a brook, in the middle of the plantations already
             mentioned.   A Grecian colonnade ornaments the front, and adds
             to ornament the important utility of a covered portico. A conser-
             vatory in the same style gives its very tasteful decoration to the
             south front, and communicates with the drawing-room.
                There are three meal-mills, each with a drying-kiln; three saw-
             mills, two of them fitted up with circular saws; ten threshing-mills,
             half of which are driven by water, and the rest by horses.

                               The population in 1801 was             1161
                                                 1811,                1190
                                                 1821,                1206
                                                 1831,                1385

                Persons insane, none; fatuous, 4; blind, 2; deaf and dumb,
             none.
                The whole pnpulation is rural. So far as can be ascertained
             there has been little change upon its numbers, for many years past.
             Towards the end of last century, it was somewhat diminished by
             the enlargement of farms, but this has been since more than com-
             pensated by the increase of cottages along the new lines of road,
             and by the settlement of crofters in the wastes.  During the pre-
             sent century, the population has been steadily though slowly on the
             rise.\f*

          <FOOTNOTE>In the population table prefixed to seventeenth volume of the former Statistical
             Report, there is a great mistake, the occurrence of which affords a strong proof of the
             necessity for great accuracy and attention in statistical inquiries.  The population of
             Boharm is there given as amounting, in 1755, by Dr Webster's inquiries, to 835,
             and in 1794, by the  minister's report, to 1294, and the difference is stated as abso-
             lute increase, the fact not being adverted to, that in the interval the annexation from
             Dundurcos had taken place, bringing with it upwards of 500 additional population.
             There was in truth a decrease in the Boharm amount of Dr Webster's return, in-
             stead of an increase.  The same mistake appears in the generally correct and valu-
             able Agricultural Survey of Banffshire, where this annexed Elginshire population
             figures as swelling an increase in Banffshire.
