     Statistical Account

   Manufactures.-The principal article of trade, in the pa-
rish, is the cutting and preparing stones for the London mar-
ket.  Upon the lands of Auchmull, are 4 quarries; from
whence are exported, annually, upwards of 45,000 square feet
of litter stones, and some years above 15,000 tons of cause-
way stones.  On another estate is a fifth quarry, from which,
it is supposed, between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet of litter
stones, and some thousands of the smaller ones, are yearly
exported.  All the quarries afford a very good kind of granite,
exceedingly durable, and capable of a fine polish.  About 50
men are employed in the stone trade, partly common, labour-
ers, hired by the day,-the rest are paid by the piece.  Ma-
sons who dress litter stones receive 2 d. the square foot; those
who make the causeway stones, 1 s. 6 d. per ton.  The car-
riage of the stones to Aberdeen forms an article of considera-
ble profit to the farmers in the vicinity, who almost constant-
ly employ their horses and carts in that way.  Upon the Don,
is a paper mill, containing two vats, and employing 16 hands;
also a mill for teasing, carding, and roving wool, and for
waulking cloths.  In the parish are 5 mills for grinding grain.
