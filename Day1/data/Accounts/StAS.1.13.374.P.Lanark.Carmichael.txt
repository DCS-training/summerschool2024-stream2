     Statistical Account

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Except those employed in
the coal-work, the great body of the people in this parish
are farmers and labourers.  They are in general sober eco-
nomical, and industrious, enjoy the necessaries of life, and
seem contented with their situation.  There are few dis-
senters from the Established Church; 2 Burghers, and 10
or 12 Macmillanites, all quiet inoffensive people.  There 
are kept in the parish 2500 sheep, 156 labouring horses,
54 colts; the number of these last is very variable, depend-
ing upon the encouragement there is for rearing horses.
The horse colts are commonly sold at 12 or 15 monthly old,
and bring from L. 6 to L. 15 price.  There are 470 miclh
cows; 250 queys.  The above is exclusive of what are
pastured in summer in part of the enclosures of Carmichael,
which are possessed by dealers, who keep no fixed stock
upon them.

<FOOTNOTE>

Lately built.  If the cotton manufactures at Lanark and Douglas succeed,
the population of this parish is likely to decrease.  The grounds being
mostly in the possession of two great proprietors, who grant no feus, is un-
favourable to the raising of a manufacturing village, which might other-
wise happen.  A proprietor, on the opposite of the Clyde, in the parish
of Lanark, has lately feued several small pieces of ground, upon which
houses are built, and some building.
