     Statistical Account

extent and surface of this parish, it is evident that the climate
must vary in different parts.  It is often milder at the east end
than the centre, and milder there, than on the higher
grounds towards the south and west; hence the farmers can
often plow on the one, when they cannot, on account of the
frost, on the other.  During winter, the fields towards the
east are often black, when those to the south and west are
covered with snow.
   The original inhabitants, it is certain, were a healthy, ro-
bust, and industrious people, employed principally in agricul-
ture.  Many of them rather above the common size.-It
was asserted by a late military gentleman of this neighbour-
hood*, who was well informed accurate in his observations,
and who had opportunity, during many years of his life,
whilst in his Majesty's service, to see the subjects of most of
the different powers, and some of the finest troops in Europe,
that John Stewart of Moyne, the proprietor of a small estate
in the hilly part of the parish, above the Craig of Nielston,
was for stature, strenght, exact proportion, and good looks,
the completest figure of a man, he had ever seen+.  What ef-
fects the luxury of modern times, and the sedentary employ-
ment which are now so prevalent, have had, and will have
upon the strenght and appearance of the people, may easily be
conjectured.

   Rivers and Lochs.-There is scarce a stream in this pa-
rish that deserves the name of a river, though there are many
rivulets, called, in the provincial dialect of the country, burns.

chased by the late Alexander Speirs of Elderslie.
