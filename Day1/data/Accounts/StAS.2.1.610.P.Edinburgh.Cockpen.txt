repair: it is much admired for its simple elegance and convenience
of structure; and it accommodates easily 750 persons. There
are free sittings for about 300. Indeed, only three families pay
seat-rents. The manse, as before stated, was built in 1816, and
is in good repair. The glebe is contiguous to it, and consists of
7 acres and 3 roods Scotch, which let at L. 3 per acre. The
stipend consists of 53 bolls, 3 pecks, and 4/5ths of a lippy of bear;
86 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 pecks, and 1 3/5ths lippy of oatmeal; and 128
pounds Scots (L. 10, 13s. 4d.) in money. The teinds are ex-
hausted; and the minister has, since the year 1824, the sum of
L. 24, 4s. 10 1/2 d. annually from the Exchequer. The number of
communicants at last communion was 316.
   There is a Free church in the village of Bonnyrigg, about a
mile from the parish church. In the same village also there are
a Morrisonian meeting-house and a Baptist meeting-house, both
attended.
   Education.-There is one parochial school, with the legal
accommodations. The number of scholars usually attending it is
from 90 to 100, and the branches taught are, English, writing,
arithmetic, mensuration, book-keeping, Latin, mathematics, and
the principles of religion. The schoolmaster has the maximum
salary and the following fees: per month for English reading,
10d. ; writing, 1s. ; arithmetic, 1s. 2d. ; mensuration, book-keep-
ing, or Latin, 1s. 8d. There are 4 unendowed schools; another by
about 50; the third by about 30, and the fourth by about 20.
   Poor.-The average number of persons that receive parish aid
regularly is 57; and the average sum they receive is 1s. 6d. a-week.
Many, however, receive occasional relief, without becoming regu-
lar paupers. The annual amount of church collections is about
L. 40; and this is kept a separate fund from the assessment to
supply a different class of poor. We have an assessment of about
L. 300 a-year.
   Alehouses.-There are 9 public-houses in the parish, and cer-
tainly they have rather a bad effect upon morals; but they are all
decently kept.
   Fuel.-Coals are the only kind of fuel used, and they are all
procured in the parish or its immediate neighbourhood, at the rate
of 3d. per cwt.
