spirit will in time certainly induce them to do, this would
only extenuate not eradicate the evil.  Every tenant has a
certain number of cotagers, to the amount sometimes of
6 or 8, whom he binds to relieve him, not only of part of
his services to the heritor, but also to give him a certain
number of days in seed-time, moss-time, and harvest.
Now, substantial redress of this grievance will not be ea-
sily obtained, unless heritors were to disallow cottagers
altogether, which would depopulate their kinds; or, which

knit woollen stockings, and spin slax.  The knitters, on
an average, work 60 dozen, at 12 s. the dozen, every
month; while the spinsters, who are but few in number,
earn only about L. 4 or L. 5 monthly.  The annual in-

L. 500.

   Roads.-The roads in the parish were made and are kept in
repair by the statute labour.  For what of gravel, they are
frequently deep, but never impassable.  The military road
through the Cairn-o'-Mount, leading by Huntly to Fort
George passes through its western extremity; and, as it
