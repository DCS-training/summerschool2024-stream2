period, were, at first, coarse checkered linen cloth, and ben-
gals, afterwards checkered linen handkerchiefs, some of them
fine, and beautifully variegated, by the manner in which the
different colours were disposed, according to the taste and in-
vention of the manufacturers.  These were succeeded by fa-
brics of a lighter, and more fanciful kind, consisting not only
of plain lawns, but likewise those that were striped or check-
ered with cotton, and others that were ornamented with a
great variety of figures; some of which last articles still con-
tinue to be manufactured there.  Towards the end of the
above mentioned period, the making of linen gauze was a
considerable branch of trade in Paisley; and, before the mid-
dle of it, a new species of manufacture of great importance
was begun by the inhabitants of this place, which they have
continued to prosecute with peculiar advantage; I mean, the
making of white sewing thread, known to the merchants by
the name of ounce thread, as distinguished from the different
kinds of coloured and white thread which have been manu-
factured chiefly at Aberdeen and Dundee.  This valuable
branch of trade may be said to have been imported into this
country by a gentlewoman in that neighbourhood*, who,
about the year 1725, found means to procure from Hol-
land the machinery which is necessary for carrying it on, and
set the first example of it in her own family.  Such a spirit
of enterprise, of ingenuity, and of sober industry, marks a
character of high distinction in the statistical account of any
country.  The manufacturing genius of the people of Paisley
well knew how to profit by so worthy an example.  That
business was soon introduced there, where it has had its prin-
cipal feat ever since, and is now carried on to a very consi-
derable extent.-About the year 1760, the making of silk
