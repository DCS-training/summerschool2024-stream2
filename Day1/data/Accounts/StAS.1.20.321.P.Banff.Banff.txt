lent field for the healthful exercises of riding and the
golf.
   The only river is the Doveran, which has its source in
Aberdeenshire, and, winding through many fruitful and
highly cultivated plains, falls into the sea at Banff.

   State of Property, Valued and Real Rents.-The Earl of
Findlater, the Earl of Fife, and Lord Banff, are the princi-
pal proprietors; of whom, Lord Fife is the only residing
heritor.
   The valued rent of the landward part of the parish is
L. 2313 Scots.  The real rent, including the salmon-fishing
and town's lands, is estimated at L. 4500 Sterling.

   Burgh.-The town is situated at the influx of the river
Doveran, on a fine declivity, opening to the east and south-
east; commanding various and delightful prospects.  From
the sloping road, on the opposite side the river, the varie-
gated scenery which opens to the view is highly gratifying,
and never fails to attract the attention of strangers.
   The nobel mansion of the Earl of Fife, the spacious
lawn and extensive pleasure-grounds in his Lordship's park,
the smooth flowing Doveran, with its stately bridge, the
town and castle of Banff, the bay, harbour and shipping, are
the striking objects which at once present themselves to the
eye, and charm every traveller of taste.
   Banff is an ancient royalty, and the capital of the county.
In conjunction with Elgin, Cullen, Inverury, and Kintore,
it sends a Commissioner to Parliament.
   At what precise period it was erected into a royal burgh
cannot be ascertained.  According to tradition, it was
in the reign of Malcolm Canmore.  It is, however, certain,
that Malcolm IV. called the Maiden, was at Banff, A. D.
1163.
