   The preceding statement is favourable for earnings, from
the number of children, which is rather small; and particu-
larly on account of the ages of the children, as at that pe-
riod of their lives it is supposed in the calculation that the
woman has it in her power to work half work at spinning, and
yet take care of her house an children.  The day-labourer
of this district, and his family, are more decently clothed
than a family of the same description in England, and there-
fore it is somewhat more particularly stated than in the Print-
ed Extract accompanying the Queries.  The fuel is also higher
charged.  They are obliged to use coals, a much finer fuel than
that mentioned in the Extract, and, at the lowest, it amounts
to the expence above mentioned; but it serves them for 
light, as well as heat, in the winter season.  The greatest e-
vils of their situation arise from the lowness of their diet, and
the wretchedness of their lodging, which is cold, dark, and
dirty; exposing them to a numerous class of diseases incident
to such a condition.  The meagre food of the labouring man,
too, is unequal to oppose the effects of incessant hard labour
upon his constitution, and, by this means, his frame is often
worn down before the time of Nature's appointment.
