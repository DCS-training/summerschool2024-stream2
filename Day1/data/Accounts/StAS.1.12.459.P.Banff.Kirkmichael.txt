following verses:

     Gaoth a deas, teas is torradh,
     Gaoth a niar, iasg is bainne,
     Gaoth a tuath, fuachd is gailinn,
     Gaoth a near, meas air chrannaibh.

   "The wind of the S. will be productive of heat and fertili-
ty; the wind of the W. of milk and fish; the wind from
the N. of cold and storm; the wind from the E. of fruit on
the trees."

observed:

     Dorach doirauta' dubh,
     Chead tri la do'n gheamthra;
     Ge be bheire geil dhe'n chroi,
     Cha tugainn 's e gu samthra.

In a similar strain of belief, he wrote that passage in the Third Georgick.
where he describes the effects of the west wind in a latitude bordering upon 
marvellous.

                                               illae
     Ore omnes versae in zephyrum, stant rupibus alti

     Conjugiis, vento gravidae
