the lands were exposed to sale, and the tenants, who either
held their lands by lease, or wadsett, appeared, and were the
purchasers.  The greatest part of these lands, belong in proper-
ty to the descendants of the original purchasers at this very day;
but the superiority is vested in the family of Kinross.  The
price of those lands at the sale in 1609, was about 7 s 6 d per
acre, and as they would now rent at nearly that sum, this shews
the great increase of the value of land.
   The lands of Pitvar in like manner, belonged originally to
the family of Tullibardine; and were given away on another
occasion.  A clan then at variance with the Murrays, had
made a spreith, or open theft of their cattle, and burnt some

appeared cruel, and being committed in the church, which
was reduced to ashes, was highly offensive to the clergy.
They represented it in terms so highly aggravated, that the
Murrays were excommunicated by the Pope.  In those days,
says the above author, "A sentence of excommunication was
"no less formidable than a sentence of outlawry.  Besides
"excluding those, upon whom it fell, from Christian privi-

"citizens."  Hence, as an atonement, and to make up
peace with the church, the chieftain of the Murrays made
over the lands of Pitvar to the abbots of Culross.  These
