stated to have been nearly the same for several years past. At that
time it stood thus: males, 217; females, 213; total, 430. From
the year 1805 to 1815, the population decreased, principally owing
to Mr Ford, at that time proprietor of Finhaven, taking the farms
into his own hand for the purposes of improvement. Since that
time, however, it has been on the increase, partly in consequence
of the establishment of a spinning manufactory in the parish.
  The present population is 533, and may be stated thus:-

	There is only one heritor of independent fortune resident in the
parish, viz.  Major Wilkie, H. E. I. C. of Newbarns. There are
six proprietors of land of the yearly v`lud of L. 50 and upwards.
  Character of the Peole.-In the appendix to the last Statistical
Report, Mr Raiker, the latest incumbent but one, who was minister
of the parish for sixty-three years, describes the people as being
sober, frugal, and laborious. He states, "We have neither
brewers nor beggars, nor bastards, nor bankrupts, nor idlers, nor
drunkards; every family brews their own beer; no sectaries."
The character of the people is still sober, frugal, and laborious;
but, with respect to the other statements of the reverend gentle-
man, I cannot say that they all hold good at the present day. It
may be added, however, that there is no poaching, nor smuggling,
nor pawnbroking. The people, in general, are cleanly; and, with
respect to most of the comforts of life, they have partaken in that
progressive improvement which is now so general over the land.
They are better clothed, better lodge, and better fed, than for-
merly. Their fare is the common fare in this quarter of the
country;-the diffrent preparations of oatmeal, sometimes flour-
FORFAR.
