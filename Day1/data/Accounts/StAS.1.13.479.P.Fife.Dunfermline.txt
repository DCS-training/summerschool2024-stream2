     Statistical Account

   Crossford, Halbeath, and Crossgates, are situated on the
great turnpike road, which passes through the town and
parish of Dunfermline, from the western to the eastern ex-
tremity.  Mastertown, Petimuir, and Pitliver, are situa-
ted on the southern division of the parish.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The advantages of this pa-
rish are various.  It abounds with lime.  Coal is compa-
ratively cheap.  House rents are moderate.  There is a
regular post-office, which annually brings to the revenue
upwards of L. 400 Sterling.  There is a ready market for
the various production of the land; nad there are sea-
ports, with convenient harbours, for exporting or import-
ing by water, all the necessaries of life.
   In this, as in every other parish, there are some disad-
vantages.  Owing to the numerous mines and subterrane-
ous levels which have lately been opened, the water is
greatly drained from the surface, and in some places it is
scarce, and but indifferent.  The roads are often in disre-
pair.  Within these few years, since turnpikes were rai-
sed, they are however greatly improved, and it is expect-
ed they will be still better, when the statute-labour shall
be paid in money, and properly expended.  The removal
of the Sheriff-substitute from this district is another disad-
vantage deserving attention.  Being near 30 miles from
Cupar, the inhabitants are exposed to much trouble and
expense, before they obtain decisions in litigated questions.
   The language is a mixture of Scotch and English.  The
voice is raised, and the emphasis frequently laid on the
last word of the sentence.  Many of the names pf places
are derived from the Celtic.
   There are about 200 ploughs, almost all of the English
or lately improved kind; about 300 carts; 8 gentlemens
