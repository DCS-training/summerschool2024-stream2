the value of the thread whitened here annually, is about
5000 L. Sterling.-A considerable quantity of linen yarn is
spun in this parish, by which a woman can earn about 4 d.
per day.-The weavers here are kept in employment by
working for Messrs Kilgours, woollen-manufacturers at Kin-

deaths were more than double that year, owing to ravages
made by this disease.

   Language and Etymologies.-The dialect called broad Bu-

reason, for attempting to derive the names of places in this
country from the Celtic, as there is no evidence, that it was
inhabited by the Celts.  The names of all the places in this
