                         IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Agriculture and Rural Economy.-The number of acres in this
parish, at once so large and so irregular, cannot be correctly as-
certained; but these may be about 57,000, of which 5000 or 6000
are moorland. It is supposed that there are 100 acres of natural
wood, and 400 of plantations. The indigenous wood consists prin-
cipally of oak, elm, and birch. No additional land could be pro-
fitably brought under cultivation.
   Rent of Land.-The average rent of arable land per acre may
be estimated at L. 1, 11s.: the rent varying from 2s. 6d. to L. 5
per acre. Few or no cattle are taken in for grazing.
   Rate of Wayes.-Farm-labourers receive 1s. 6d. to 2s. in sum-
mer, and from 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d. in winter; masons and carpenters
one-third more. There are 55 hand-loom weavers in the village
of Coldingham, who are employed by Glasgow manufacturers to
weave cotton, who for several years past have received only 6s. per
week for working thirteen hours a-day.
   Husbandry.-The general mode of husbandry practised in the
parish is that of the four-shift system. Leases are generally for a pe-
riod of twenty-one years. Farm dwelling-houses and offices are large
and commodious, suited to the size of the farm and to the wealth
and respectability of the farmer. There are neither quarries nor
mines worked in the parish.
   Produce.-The average gross amount and value of produce year-
ly raised in the parish cannot be exactly ascertained: but the fol-
lowing is an approximation:
