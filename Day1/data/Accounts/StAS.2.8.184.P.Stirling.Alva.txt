of these memorials of other times are still standing. Our forefa-
thers, we know, were wont to set up a stone of remembrance to
commemorate any battle or signal event, or more frequently to
mark the grave of a hero. In the works ascribed to Ossian, this
custom is often alluded to, as when the bard, and Toscar, his bro-
ther, were sent by Fingal to signalize a victory by raising up the
"grey-stone on the heath." One of these records of the past was
dug up, some years ago, in a field adjacent to the grebe, lying on
its flat surface, and beneath it was found a human jaw-bone so large
as to be attributed to a giant. Another of these stones was long
to be seen in a neighbouring enclosure, standing erect, with an in-
scription, so indistinct as not to be legible. The village vulcan,
in his vain attempts to decypher it, got into a towering passion, and
with his forehammer completely destroyed the inscription, already
almost worn away by time's effacing fingers. The spirit of the
Vandals is not yet dead. A few years since, while some persons
were digging in the northern part of the parish, probably the site
of the earliest buildings here, and called Strude, they excavated
a number of human remains. The rubbish in this spot led to the
belief that a cemetery, and probably a Roman Chapel, had once
stood there, in times now lost in the mists of ages.

"Pulvere vix tectae poterunt monstrare ruinac."

At the northern extremity of Queenshaugh, St Ninians, a curious
relic was, about A. D. 1790, dragged out of the river. It was a brass
collar, with the inscription, "Alexander Stewart found guilty of
death for theft at Perth, 5 Decemder 1701, and gifted by the Jus-
ticiary as a perpetual servant to Sir John Aresken of Alva." This
relic is in possession of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland.
