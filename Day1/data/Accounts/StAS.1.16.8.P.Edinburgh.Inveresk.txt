Langside.  The bloody field of Pinkie under her eye, might
have put this ill-fated Queen on her guard.  But unfit for
the rugged times in which she lived, she had the misfor-
tune to be at once facile and obstinate.  The late proprie-
tor of Carberry, John Fullarton, Esq; has marked this spot
to posterity by planting a copse-wood upon it.

   Bridge.-The bridge of Musselburgh, over which the
Scottish army marched on the day of the battle of Pinkie,
is of great, but unknown antiquity.  It is most likely, that
it is a work of the Romans, as they certainly had many
houses in what is now called Fisherrow, as well as their
haven for shipping; and could not possibly suffer their co-
lony to be divided, and their harbour separated from their
fort by a river, that is frequently unfordable for many days
together.  This bridge has many marks of antiquity; and
as several parts of the arches approach nearly to a straight
line, the frame, or coom, on which it was raised, must have
sunk while it was building.  The arches are 50 feet wide,
their spring only 10 feet; whoever built it must have in-
tended, to place the approaches to it out of the reach of the
tide; which is the case to this day, and demonstrates that
the coast is not materially changed, or that the sea has not
gained on the land since that period, as the site of the har-
bour proves that it has not receded from it.

   Pinkie House.-Pinkie House, though not very ancient,
(as it was built by Alexander Seton, first Earl of Dunferm-
line, in the year 1622), deserves to be mentioned, because
it was a vulgar notion for many years, that there were as
many doors and windows in it, as there are days in the
year.  This has been copied into many of the tours and
travels into Scotland, though without foundation; and
serves only to prove, that the house of Pinkie, though half
