   In 1777.-That in 1777, the rents doubled what they
were in 1750, in consequence of the beginning improve-
ments in agriculture at that time.
   That in 18 years more, i. e. in 1795, the value of pro-
perty actually doubled what it was in 1777, and from the
same causes, added to the decreased value of money.

   Rents from 1750 to 1796.-About the year 1750, the
best clay farms were let at 5 s. per acre.  A few years after,
when valued for new leases, they were supposed to be over-
rated at 10s.  In 1759, the same farms were let at 17 s.
Amd the same lands would be probably let now at 50 s. per
acre at least.
   Most of the estates in the parish, indeed all of them, may
be said to have been improved in the same proportion, but
at an immense expence to the proprietors, who have spared
neither labour nor money, in fencing, draining, building
houses, furnishing lime and marl to tenants, relieving them
of all feudal burdens, subscribing largely to turnpike and
parochial roads, and planting in such lands not so fit for
other agricultural purposes.

   Reasons for this Increase.-These improvements appear
astonishing; but notwithstanding which, although they add
greatly to the general stock of national wealth, yet the in-
crease of value in property is by no means of so much real
advantage to the landholders as at first sight may appear.
For, in the first place, the expense of the improvements is
almost equal to a purchasel; and as labour of every kind,
servants wages, and the expence of every necessary of life
are doubled, and many of them trebled in that time.
   No doubt improvements in agriculture have done wonders,
