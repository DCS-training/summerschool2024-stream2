church, &c. making a total of about L.540, was sufficient for the
annual demand for some years.  The following is the progress of
the rate since 1808, at intervals of five years:-

   The assessment, as above stated, is in addition to the collections
at the doors of the parish church, and other church funds, which
of late years have averaged about L.60.  The only permanent fund at
the charge of the session is a sum composed of various legacies,
and amounting in all to about L.700, the interest of which is ap-
plied to the poor. *
   The ordinary management of the poor is conducted in the usual
way by overseers, specially appointed at the annual meeting of he-
ritors and kirk session, and by the elders of the parish.  Monthly
meetings are held for the purpose of granting occasional aid, and
quarterly ones for entering paupers on the roll.
   The following table exhibits, in one view, some particulars of
importance relative to the practical working of the system.

   Highest rate allowed to the regular pensioners, (except when
confined and in a state of derangement, in which case + more is
given) L.3, 5s. per quarter ; lowest rate 6s. 6d. ; average of the
whole 18s. 11 3/4d.  The number of occasional poor is very various,
but the average expense of this class may be L. 150a year.
   The principle of assessment in this parish used to be the real
rental ; one-half on heritors, and the other on tenants.  Of late,
this has been departed from, and an effort has been made to return

<FOOTNOTES>Besides the above, there is under the administration of the senior minister
of the parish, and three trustees, by direction of the Court of Chancery, the an-
nual sum of about L.23, the produce of a principal sum, left by the late Lady
Grant, of Monimusk, and vested in the funds.  This sum is distributed annually, in
the month of January, to poor householders, who are not receiving parochial aid.
Lady Grant, before her marriage to Sir William Grant of Monimusk, had been mar-
ried, to Mr Andrew Miller, bookseller, London; the son of the Rev. Robert Miller,
one of the Ministers of the Abbey parish.
           The ordinary charge of lunatic asylums is allowed, varying from 7s. to 10s. per
week.
