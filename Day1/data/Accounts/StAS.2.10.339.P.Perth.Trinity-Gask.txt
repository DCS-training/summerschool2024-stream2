                      III.-POPULATION.
   There are old people in the parish who speak of the population
of Trinity-Gask in their early days as having been double its pre-
sent amount.

<TABLE=III.-POPULATION.>
       In 1755, Dr Webster's report makes the population  913
          1796, it was                                    795
          1831,                                           620
          1837,                                           554

This rapid decrease is caused by the converting of a number of
small into one large farm, and the dislike which the tenants have
to keeping up the cottages upon them, both from the expense which
it occasions, and the annoyance and loss to which they are subject-
ed, by their occupants persisting in keeping poultry, which support
themselves at the farmer's expense, and greatly aid the poor people
in paying their rents.

                            IV.-INDUSTRY.
   Trinity.-Gask is entirely an agricultural parish. We have two
or three weavers, as many masons and carpenters as are requir-
ed for the work of the parish, two shoemakers, but no tailor.
   The number of arable acres is 4290.  Perhaps 2000 more might
be brought in, and they are now in the courre of being so. The
expense, however, is very great, from the amount of draining requir-
