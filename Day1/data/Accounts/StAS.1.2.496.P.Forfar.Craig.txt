     Statistical Account

   This parish is situated in the presbytery of Brechin, in the
synod of Angus and Mearns, and shire of Forfar.  It is be-
tween 5 and 6 miles long, and its greatest breadth is some-
what more than 2.  To the south and west it is considerably
elevated, being about 400 feet above the level of the sea.  It
contains, in all, 3308:1:26 acres, Scots measure; the whole
of which (a few hundred acres excepted) is arable.  The soil,
is, in general, very good, and produces excellent crops.

   Rivers, High Grounds.-The Southesk, after crossing a ba-
son of water, about 8 or 9 miles in circumference, (which is
filled by the tide twice every 24 hours) divides this parish from
that of Montrose.  It afterwards falls into the sea, at the east-
ern extremity of this parish.-On the coast, Dunninald is
the highest ground, Govanhill in the middle, and Pittaris hill,
and Mount-bay to the West; from all which there are very 
extensive and pleasant prospects.  Mount-Bay was formerly
called the King's feat, Red-castle, in the neighbourhood, hav-
ing formerly been a royal residence.

   Climate, Diseases, Mineral Springs, etc.-The air, in a si-
tuation to elevated, is pure; the climate generally healthy.-
The most common diseases are fevers and consumptions; there
are some instances of dysenteries, and rheumatisms; agues are
very rare, and there are some few cases of epilepsy and of lu-
nacy.  'A singular kind of distemper, called the louping ague,
has sometimes made its appearance in this parish.  The pati-
ents, when seized, have all the appearances of madness; thei
bodies are variously distorted; they run, when they find an
opportunity, with amazing swistness, and over dangerous pas-
ses; and, when confined to the house, they jump, and climb
in an astonishing manner, till their stregth be exhaufted.-
Cold bathing is found to be the most effectual remedy.-
