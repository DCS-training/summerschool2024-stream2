yearly. In 1834, there were 422 members, the payments in the
course of the year amounting to L. 59, 5s.
   Poor and Parochial Funds.-The inhabitants of the barony still
observe some customs of their forefathers, which have a reference
to the old parish of Kinneil. This appears particularly in the
management of their poor, which is quite distinct from that of Bo'-
ness. The inhabitants of the barony put their cburch-door col-
lections for the poor into the old ladle of Kinneil church, whilst
the inhabitants of the town put theirs into a different receptacle.
After the poor belonging to Kinneil are supplied, the remainder
of the funds that can be spared is distributed to the poor of the
town.
   The following statement of the expenditure and receipts of the
poor's funds of the barony and of the town respectively, is the
average of three years, 1835, 1836, and 1837:
