a considerable expence, built for themselves tolerable habita-
tions.  The arable part of the farm, with as much ground
as could he improved by cultivation, they divided into shares,
proportionate to their respective families.  This being done,
they felt to work with plough, spade, and mattock, occasio-
nally uniting their forces to what they could not singly per-

100 to 150 souls not only derived their living out of the
farm, but paid their rent, perhaps without any sensible dimi-

the plain had not been tilled.  By such management as this,
the hills might be covered with sheep, the plains with corn,

beautifying the face of the country, this would in time save
the money, which must otherwise be disbursed by the inhabi-
tants for various purposes.  At present the trees in the parish
are so rare, that a child could almost tell them; yet there are
