   Colliery, etc.-The greatest part of the inhabitants are far-
mers and day-labourers; but besides ordinary tradesmen and
artificers, such as masons, wrights, etc. there are a good
number of colliers, weavers, and cotton spinners.  The coal-
work has been of long standing, and is said to be the oldest in
the neighbourhood of Glasgow.  There are about 100 coal-
pits which have been wrought.  If each of these, at an a-
verage, be supposed to have lasted only 4 years, the coal-
work must have been wrought for 4 centuries, and this car-
ries it back, till within little more than a century, of the first
knowledge of coal as a fuel in Scotland *.  The field, in
which the coals are found, lies on the south side of Clyde,
and may be about a mile square.  It has a general slope to-
wards the river, with considerable swellings here and there;
and, in several places, is cut and broken by rivulets.  In this
field there are known to be 5 strata, or seams of coal, of dif-
ferent thicknesses, and at different distances from one ano-
ther.  These seams are always nearly parallel to one ano-
ther, but not parallel to the surface of the earth, having their
dip of declination towards Clyde.  At the river they lie
many feet deep, but rise gradually till they crop out, or
reach the surface within less than a mile and an half of it.
The nearer you approach to Clyde, the dip is so much the

*The earliest evidence of the use of coal as a fuel in Scotland, is said to
be a charter of William de Obervill, in which he grants liberty to the ab-
bot and convent of Dunfermline, to open a coal-pit upon his lands of Pe-
tyncrieff.  This charter is dated the day before the feast of St Ambrole,
in March 1291.  Davidson's Accounts of the Chamb. of Scotl.  Appen.
