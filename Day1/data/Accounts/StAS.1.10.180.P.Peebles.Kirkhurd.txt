   Agriculture, etc.-About 480 acres are kept in tillage.
The common mode of farming in the crost land, (which re-
ceives all the house dung of the farms), is to have a third
part under pease, potatoes, and turnips as cleaning and meli-
orating crops; which third, the succeeding year (if not dung-
ed with the cleaning crops) is dunged for bear, and next
year is-sown with oats.  Clover, and, in a great measure,
turnips, are excluded from the rotation, from the want of
inclosures, and the difficulty of defending them from the
sheep in winter.  There may be about 240 acres of crost
managed in this way, viz. 80 in pease, potatoes, turnips, and
lint, 80 in bear, and 80 in oats, in a year.  The remaining
240 acres under tillage are outfield, and are manured by the
cattle folded at night in summer, to keep them from the
growing corns.  The fo'ds are inclosures made of fod, at
the expence of about 1 1/2 d. or 2 d. the running rood of 6
yards, at 4 1/2 feet in height.  The leys intended to be brought
into tillage are inclosed in this manner early in the spring;
the sheep and black cattle are kept in distinct folds; and 10
score of sheep may dung in this way about 3 acres in a sea-
son.  When the corns are got off the fields in harvest, the
folds are levelled, and the ground ploughed.  Three crops of
oats are, in general, taken successively after folding; but,
when the folded land is also limed on the sward, 5 crops are
sometimes taken.  The land is then left to collect sward as
