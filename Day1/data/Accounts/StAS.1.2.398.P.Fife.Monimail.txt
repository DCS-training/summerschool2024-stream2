markable, that, in this neighbourhood, both to the north and
south of the Eden, the soil, in rising from the plain, becomes
richer; but is thin and sandy in the low grounds.-The hills
are rather green than heathy.  The Mount-hill is of conside-
rable height, and has been planted for several years.  Vessels,
on making the land from the east seas, are assisted and direct-

The situation of the parish, in general, is dry and salubrious.
No peculiar epidemical distempers are known.  The inhabi-

house was struck with a remarkable thunder storm.  The
whole house, on every side, and from top to bottom, was af-
fected.  The stream of lightning, it is supposed, was attrac-
ted by a long iron spike, on the top of a cupola covered with
lead.  The effects of it were felt, and are still visible in almost
every part of the house: providentially no person was mate-
rially hurt.  Professor M'Claurin, at Lord Leven's desire, exa-
mined the progress and vestiges of the storm*.-In a large
mirror, a piece, of the size of a crown, was melted, and no
