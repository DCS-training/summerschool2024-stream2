winter furrow, as soon as the season will permit; when the land
comes again in course to be manured, and undergoes the same
rotation.  The in-field land is generally an excellent soil, full
of manure, but stocked with destructive weeds, of which
wild oats and knot-grass are among the worst.  Without the
intervention of grass and green crops, to destroy the weeds
and recruit the soil, the produce of the corn crops cannot be
supposed to be in any proportion to the goodness of the land.
An average, in tolerable seasons, will not exceed from 4 to 5
bolls per acre.
   The outfield lands are managed in different ways, either
by folding or croping, without manure, or by water falling.
This last method can be practised only in particular situa-
tions, having the command of water, and where the ground
hangs considerably*, to admit of spreading the water easily
over it; and it is intended to fertilize the soil, for a succes-
sion of three or four crops of oats.  Though no great care
or attention is bestowed, in spreading the water equally, the
first and second crops are said frequently to equal those pro-
duced on the same lands by liming; but the two last are, as
it may be supposed, equally inferior.  After these corns crops,
the land is left lee 2 or 3 or 4 years, to get a sward for a-
nother watering, and succession of grain crops.  As this mode
of cultivation is limited to particular spots, out-field lands are
more generally managed, by folding and croping, without any
manure; and their extent, and the stock of cattle which the
farmer possesses on the pasture on his farm, will enable him
to keep all the circumstances, which lead him to follow either
of these methods.  Where the out-field is extensive, and does
not produce better than ordinary grass it is impossible in

never watered, as in England, for pasture.
