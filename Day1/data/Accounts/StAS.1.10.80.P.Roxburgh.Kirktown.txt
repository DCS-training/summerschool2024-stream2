   Markets, etc.-The nearest market town is Hawick, about
3 miles distant, where vivres are sold nearly at the same rate
as in Edinburgh.  The great road from Edinburgh to New-
castle, by Selkirk and Hawick, passes through the middle of
this parish; one of the great advantages of which to this
neighbourhood, is the opening up an easy access, over the
border mountains, to the coal-mines in the west parts of
Northumberland.  These and the peat-mosses, with which
the country abounds, furnish abundant, though expensive
fuel.  There are vestiges of some, wood; but, at present, not
a tree, and scarcely a bush is to be seen in the parish.
