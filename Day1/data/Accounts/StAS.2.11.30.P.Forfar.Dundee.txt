a considerable share of the commerce of Scotland, as, indeed,
might be expected from the great advantages of its situation. In
1569, perhaps the remotest period to which authentic records of
the state of the shipping here reach, we find that the principal part
of the fleet sent in pursuit of the worthless Bothwell consisted of
three ships supplied by Dundee. In 1651, when the town was sur-
prised and sacked by General Monck, one hundred ships, as before
stated, were found to belong to it, of which sixty were loaded with
booty captured by the besiegers. It is not improbable, however,
that some vessels from other parts had takdn refuge in almost the
only strong-hold that had hitherto successfully resisted the gold or
the prowess of the invaders. From the year 1652, the progressive
increase of the trade and commerce of Dundee showed the elasti-
city of the national character, not easily nor permanently subdued.
Yet it was not until the middle of the following century, when the
people of Scotland began to prize and to take advantage of their
connection with a larger, better cultivated, and richer country, that
our trade and commerce showed signs not only of life, but also of
health and vigour.

	It was only in 1815 that the first great impulse was given to
the manufactures and commerce of Dundee, by the renovation
and extension of the harbour. Prior to that date, the accommo-
dation provided for the shipping was adapted to the most limit-
ed commerce only. One small pier, and two or three clumsy
erections in a state of dilapidation, and which it required a
boat to reach, constituted the whole protection for the shipping,
and the whole convenience for discharging or loading. The
spirit of enlightened enterprise had been at work for several
years; but it was only in the year above-mentioned that appli-
cation was made to Parliament, and a bill obtained, for separating
the harbour from the other branches of the common good, and
