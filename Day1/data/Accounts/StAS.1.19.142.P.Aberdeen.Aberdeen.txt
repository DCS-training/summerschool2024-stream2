the first known inhabitants of the whole island, the ancient
Britons.  Another argument that it is from the old British
or Welch, not from the Irish or Erse, that Aberdeen is de-
rived, is, that in no place where the Erse has been, time
immemorial, the vernacular tongue, do we find any name
of similar derivation; whereas we find many in these parts
where the other language was known to have prevailed.
In Scotland, for example, all the Abers are on the east side.
There we have Aberdeen, Aberdour, Aberbrothock, Aber-
lemny, Abernethy.  In Wales they abound-Aberavon,
Aberconway.  Aberfraw, Abergely, Abergerlick, and Aber-
ystwith.  In the neighbouring western parts of England-
Aberford and Abergaveny.  But not any that we know
in the eastern parts of England, none in Ireland, nor on the
west of Scotland, the country of the Highlanders, where the
Erse has been the language of the people for many ages.
It may seem strange that there should be no example of
this British idiom on the east coast of England, of which
the Britons were so long in possession.  We know no way
this can be accounted for, but by observing, that when the
country was subdued by the Saxons, the old inhabitants,
were not, as is common, suffered to remain and intermingle
with the conquerors, but were cruelly expelled, and forced
to take refuge in the mountains of the west, a tract of
country comparatively barren, and almost inaccessible.  It
is this total and sudden extermination, by which alone we
can account for for strange a fact, that few places in the
eastern parts of England retain their old British names.
That the ancient Britons, and the Irish or Scots (for the
name Scoti was for ages used indifferently of both) were
originally and equally Gaulish colonies, there is no room to
doubt; but as they have come off at different times, and
probably from distant parts of the extensive countries peo-
pled by the Gauls, the dialects of these different colonies,
