two horses and a plough, who have only a very small piece
of ground which they dress, either by themselves, or by
joining with some of their neighbours in the same situation.
This occupies only a little of their time.  During the rest,
they find abundance of employment in carting lime from
Closeburn, and coals from Sanquhar to the limeworks and
to the town of Dumfries.  The number of carts in the parish
is about 95.  The ordinary cart-load of coals for a single
horse, which is the way they are almost all drawn, is about
12 cwt.

   Stack.-The stock in this parish, which is pretty accurately
ascertained, consists of 119 horses, 330 milch cows, 170
young black cattle, 2527 sheep, and a few swine, perhaps 40
or 50, their number varying according to the goodness of
the potatoe crop.  The sheep are all of the short-faced kind,
except small parcels of a mixed breed, feeding upon the low
lands along with the cows*.

   Village.-The village of Thornhill is the only one deser-

*The price of provisions is much the same here as in Dum-
fries market.  Only potatoes, which are a very great article of
provision, are generally somewhat cheaper, as great crops of
them are raised in this district; and they cannot be carried to-
any great distance for sale, on account of their weight.  Their
price varies from 8 d. to 1 s. 4 d. per peck, which weighs about
one cwt.  Potatoes constitute at least one half of the food of the
common people; none can be cheaper, and it would appear,
none more wholesome.
   The wages of a man servant in the house are from 6 L. to 8 L.
per annum, besides, victuals; of a woman servant, from 2 L. 10 s.
to 3 L. 10 s.  The daily wages of a mason are 20 d. of a joiner,
16 d. and of a common labourer, 9 d. during three months of
winter, and from 1 s. to 14 d. the rest of the year, without
victuals.  There are no remains of feudal services in this parish.
