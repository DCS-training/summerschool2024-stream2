hart, as soon as the requisite accommodations are provided,
which are in forwardness.
   About 40 scholars attend the parochial school in sum-
mer, and 60 in winter; and 30 the Society school in sum-
mer, and 50 in winter; but it is to be regretted, that they
are generally very young children, who do not remain long
enough at school to receive much permanent benefit.  In
Glenmoriston a Society schoolmaller is employed, with
L. 15 salary, besides the usual accommodations.  There are
seldom above 30 scholars at this school.  The Society
schoolmasters teach Gaelic, and reading the Scriptures in
that language, as well as in English.
   The Committee for managing the Royal Bounty, give
L. 12 to a catechist in this parish; and both he and the So-
ciety schoolmasters are most useful in meeting the people,
especially such as are distant from places of worship, parti-
cularly on the Lord's Day, when they pray and read with
the inhabitants, and instruct them in the principles of reli-
gion.
   In Glenmoriston there are bout 80 Roman Catholics,
and a very few in Urquhart; but they are moderate, and
several of them come occasionally to the Established Church.
The rest of the inhabitants are Protestants of the Establish-
ed  Church.
   The number of inhabitants in the parish of Urquhart, of
all ages, are 2355; of which, in Urquhart properly so call-
ed, there are 1710; and in Glenmoriston 645.  In 1755,
the number was 1943 souls; the increase consequently
amounts to 412.  The baptisms, at an average, are 80;
and the marriages 20, in both districts.   The deaths cannot
be ascertained, as there are not less than four burial-grounds,
at a great distance from each other.  The number of mar-
riages and baptisms have increased for several years past
