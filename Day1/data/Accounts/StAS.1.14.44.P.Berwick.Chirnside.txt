quarry stones, the men generally strip themselves to a
thinner shirt or waistcoat than was used in the days of
their fathers; and, from the changeability of a day, in
the months of winter and spring, expose themselves to

There were several instances, in the last generation, of
longevity, to the extent of 85 and 90 years, and 1 or 2

strength, which some above 70 now possess, promise
their arriving at a remarkable lenth of years.  Fatal

the year 1791, and through the winter months and
spring of the year 1792; when, by a contagion in the

so easily obtained, and the salutary practice of inocu-
lation being extended, will afford conviction of its hap-
