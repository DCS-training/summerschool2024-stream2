grass seed.  Proprietors of land have begun to pasture the
greatest part of their estates.  This method, they find, brings
as good a rent, and tends to improve their property.  Some
of this ground sets at 1 L. 17 s. per acre.  It is to be observed,
that the rise of their rents always makes farmers thrive:  It
calls forth their industry, and compels them to be active. 
Though the value of land be vastly increased, the people live
and dress much better than formerly.  Property here is of-
ten transferred from one owner to another, as is the case in
the neighbourhood of every great commercial town.  Indeed,
the reason why this parish is in such a high degree of culti-
vation, is, that when a merchant has been successful, he pur-
chases a piece of land, builds an elegant villa, and improves
his property at the dearest rate.  This accounts for the vast
number of gentlemen's houses with which the parish is adorn-
ed, many of them finished in the greatest taste.-There are
kept in the parish 1 coach, 5 chaises, and 5 phaetons.  Ow-
ing to the numerous inclosures, there are few sheep.  The
large kind, which feed with the cows, are very prolific.  One
ewe, for instance, in 9 years, produced 30 lambs.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-Wherever manufactures and
commerce seat themselves, their influence on landed property
is felt in an inconceivable degree; and how much is it the
interest of landholders to cherish and protect them!  conse-
quently, the rise of the value of land in this parish is aston-
ishing.  One farm, which, about the year 1730, cost 300 L.
was lately sold for 2100 L.-As the gentlemen pay particular
attention to that business, the roads are kept in excellent re-
pair.  The statute work is commuted.  The great road from
Glasgow to Edinburgh, by Whiteburn, runs through this
parish, on which there is a toll-bar, worth a vast sum yearly.
There is also a toll at Langloan, on the road from Glasgow
