to delve* their several divisions of land, than be at the
trouble of clearing the ground, or of using horses and
ploughs, especially as their immediate subsistence depends
on their success in fishing, to which they must pay regu-
lar attention: besides, it is found by experience, that
there is a much greater increase of corn, from the same
quantity of seed sown in delvings, than from the like
quantity sown in ploughed ground; bear sown in the straight
spade delving is generally found to yield sixteen in return.

   Soil of Davoch Ard-Assint, or Assint Height.-The soil
here is, for most part, a rich heavy loam; in some other
places it is gravelly.  Limestone and moss abound through
the whole extent of it.  The fields, though few, and not of
great extent, are as regularly laid out as the surface will
allow; some rocks above, and others below the surface,
give embarrassment, and require the attention of the
ploughman to avoid them; for which reason there is
in time of tilling a man who attends with the afore-
mentioned crooked spade, whose employment it is to delve
the ground where it is supposed there are concealed rocks
and stones, in order to expose them to view, so that neither
plough nor harness may receive hurt.

   Cultivation, Manure, and Implements of Husbandry.-
Yearly from the middle of July to the 15th of August, the
labourer employs a considerable part of that time in ga-
thering earth, which he forms into an oval or quadrangular
figure; above that are laid strata of dung, lime, and
whatever else may enrich his dunghills, to which a consi-
derable addition is made by the litter of cattle, housed
early in the spring.  If that season be favourable, the til-
lage commences at or about the middle of Febru-
ary.  Oats are sown in March and beginning of April.
