sist of this sort of stone; but what is found within flood
mark, being impregnated with saline particles, always retains
a moisture, and is therefore improper for building dwelling
houses.  Mill stone of a good quality is found in many pla-
ces along the shore.

   Roads and Bridges.-The post road leading from Montrose
to Aberdeen runs through this parish, in a line almost parel-
lel with the coast, and nearly at the distance of a mile from
it.  Not far from the church, and near to each other, there
are two stone bridges upon this road, which contribute much
to its improvement.  A different direction, however, would
be necessary to render it completely easy, as the ground, both
on the East and West sides of these bridges, rises to a consi-
derable height.  From the nature of the soil and the difficul-
ty of bringing gravel from the shore, the high way has hither-
to been deep in winter.  Nor are the cross roads in a better
state.  The statute labour is insufficient, and is performed with
reluctancy.  A turnpike has often been proposed through
this county, and will doubtless in the end be found the only
means for promoting social intercourse, by rendering travel-
ling more comfortable.

   Disadvantages.-Deep roads and a bad harbour are
the only material disadvantages under which this district la-
bours.  Fuel is no doubt scarce; but were the harbour im-
proved, the opportunity of landing coals at all seasons, would
prevent the want of any other kind of fuel from being felt.
At present many poor people frequently pay an exorbitant
price for this necessary article, and are often obliged to en-
dure the rigour of the cold, from not being able in summer
to lay in a sufficient supply.
