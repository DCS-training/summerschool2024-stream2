years ago L. 60 Sterling.  There are at present 6 posts; in
a few days there will be 7 posts, or runners, every week.

   Bank Agents.-There are two agents in this town for
the two banks at Aberdeen; and besides what transactions
may be made for other banks, it is supposed these two
agents do business, in the course of one year, to the extent
at least of L. 120,000 Sterling; and I am glad to find the
credit of this place is much respected, not only from its opu-
lence, but the fairness of the transactions of the inhabitants.
A bankruptcy is a very rare occurrence in this town; and
When it does happen, the loss sustained by creditors is not
very considerable.
