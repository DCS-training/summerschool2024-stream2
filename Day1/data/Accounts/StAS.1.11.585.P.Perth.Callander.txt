     of Callander.

   There is an undertaking already begun, at the joint ex-
pence of the heritors concerned, for carrying off several feet
of water from this lake, by cutting the bar, collected by the
burn of Stank, and by removing other obstructions; which,
is executed by Mr. BUCHANAN of Cambusmore, (to whom the
superintendance of the work is committed), with his usual
activity and perseverance, will gain much land to himself in his
estate of Strathyre, as well as to the other proprietors, where the
lake has been increased and turned back upon some of their
flat ground.  There is no doubt of lakes being often enlarged,
and sometimes formed, by torrents falling, at right angles, into
rivers which run in narrow valleys; especially where these
torrents have a long range, contain a great body of water, and
operate upon loose and heavy materials.

   Rivers.-All these waters meet at Callander, and form a
fine river, which is called the Teath, i.e. the warm River.
This is the most considerable branch of the Forth, both for the
quantity of its water, the straightness of its course to the sea,
the clearness of its stream, and the variety and number of its
fish.  Mr. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, and Mr.
Nimmo, in his History of Stirlingshire, call this branch by the
name of Forth; although the south branch more commonly
gets that name.  None of our rivers are navigable within the
parish.

   Mines and Fossils.-There is a beautiful quarry of lime-stone,
or rather marble, on the estate of Leney, the property of Mr.
Hamilton of Bardowie; the ground of which is a deep blue,
with variegated streaks of a pure white.  Of this beautiful
stone some gentlemen have made jams, hearths, and lintels
polished smooth as a mirror.  It is commonly burnt, and makes
a pure and valuable lime; and the fertility of the environs of
Callander are very much owing to this stimulus, judiciously
