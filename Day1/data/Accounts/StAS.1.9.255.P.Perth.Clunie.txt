its own poor in a decent manner, but also dispenses much
to indigent people from the Highlands; and especially to
a number of importunate vagrants from Perth, Dundee,
Aberdeen, Glasgow, etc. who crowd hither at all seasons
when the weather permits them to travel.  There is rea-
son to suspect, that many of those last mentioned are not
real objects of charity, but idle, profligate impostors, that
ought to be confined within the walls of a bridewell.  This
grievance calls for redress, as no person should beg, or be
permitted to beg, while Providence blesses him with the
use of his reason and of his limbs.

   Mineral Springs, Minerals and Fossils.-There is one mi-
neral spring near the Milton of Clunie, the waters of which
are sometimes used by the people of the neighbourhood as an
antiscorbutic.  There is another, of stronger powers, on the
forest, on the south bank of the burn of Lornty, a little to
the eastward of Bogmill.  Its taste resembles that of the
well at the South Inch of Perth, and its qualities are some-
what similar to those of the waters of Pitcaithly; but as nei-
ther of these springs has yet undergone any chymical ana-
lysis, their peculiar medicinal virtues are not fully ascer-
tained.
   The internal mineral strata have not been much investi-
gated.  On the surface of the ground there are masses of
the quartz, the whinstone, the moor-stone or grey granite,
the red silex with which the Caledonians pointed their
arrows, and the terra ponderosa.  In the grounds of Gour-
die, there is a species of hard red grit, quarried in different
places for the use of the proprietors.  The houses of Gourdie
and Delvin are built of it.  It is of a very durable quality,
being proof against the acid of the air, and the influence of
fire.  There is good limestone on the hill of Gourdie;
but being of a very hard nature, it is difficult to be burned.
