            an ancient ruin, called in Stobbie's map "Carquhannan Castle,"
            in Knox's Basin, 11 Carguliamian." In the neighbourhood, it goes
            by the name of Balchuinnie. There is a fine spring near it, called
            "the King's Well." The writer of this account found here, at the
            manse, what seems to have been in ancient times a baptismal font,
            an old octagon of hewn stone, perforated in the bottom, to emit
            the water occasionally.

                                            III.-POPULATION.

                There are here seven proprietors of land above L. 50 of yearly
            value.  At no distant period, the population was probably double
            of what it is at present, owing to. the smallness of farms in those
            days, to the great number of cottagers, who possessed a large, pom-
            mon as cow's grass, owing also to the number of mechanics, parti-
            cularly weavers, on the old fashioned loom.  There are still 64
            young and old in two villages, including farm-servants and their
            families.
            The yearly average of births for the last seven years is                                     5
                                  of ddaths,                                                             3

                              chiefly employed in agriculture,                                          18

                There is but one insane pauper, who had been sent to an asy-
            lum several years ago.  None blind, deaf, and dumb.
                The farms have been much enlarged within these forty years,
            and the mode of living is surely improved.  But with increased
            rents and taxes, &c., the farmers are so burdened, that even they
            can afford very few luxuries.  The lower orders are much at a
            loss for want of the usual employments of females.  For spinning
            yarn, and knitting of stockings are at so low a rase, that it is now
            hardly worth the while to attempt that kind of work, and they
            have hardly any other means of subsistence out of service, except
            for a time in the fields in summer and harvest.

                                               IV.-INDUSTRY.

            172 of imprnved pasture, without any undivided common for many
            years. There may be 297 imperial acres, which cannot well be
