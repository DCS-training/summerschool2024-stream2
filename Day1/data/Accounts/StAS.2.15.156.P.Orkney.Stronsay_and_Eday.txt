				UNITED PARISHES OF
				STRONSAY AND EDAY.

		   PRESBYTERY OF NORTH ISLES, SYNOD OF ORKNEY.
                        THE REV. JOHN SIMPSON, MINISTER.


		       I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
           Situation, Extent, &c.-STRONSAY is situated in the south-
	eastern parts of the North Isles of Orkney, having the German
	Ocean on its east side; the Stronsay Frith, by which it is sepa-
	rated from Shapinshay, on its west side; and Sanday Sound, se-
	parating it from the Island of Sanday, on the north side.  Its ex-
	treme length is 7 British miles, and its extreme breadth 5 1/2
	But, as it is of an irregular shape, being greatly indented with
	bays, it contains, including its adjacent holms, only 14 square
	miles, or 8960 imperial acres.
           Name.-Dr Barry, in his History of Orkney, gives the follow-
	ing account of the etymology of Stronsay. " From an inspection
	of the map, it appears to be not only curiously indented, but al-
	most cut into three distinct islands, which were formerly so many
	separate parishes, and this intersection has probably given rise to
	the name conferred on it by the ancients of the Isle of Strands or
	Stronsay."  More probably, the name, is derived from the word
	strom, which signifies a current.  And this epithet is not inappli-
	cable as Stronsay is swept on all sides by peculiarly rapid tides.
