favour, but of right, drawing waters, as it were, " out of
"their own cistern".  Instead of banishing delinquents
from a town or county for a limited time, by which
means they are let loose to commit their depredations in
other quarters of the country, and then, at the expiration
of their sentence, allowed to return, confirmed in their wic-
kedness, would it not tend more to reclaim them from
vice, to have a bridewell, upon a small scale, built at the
united expense of the 5 parishes, where they could be con-
fined at hard labour and solitary confinement, for a period
proportioned to their crimes:  Such a plan, it is appre-
hended, would be attended with the most salutary effects,
and reclaim many, who otherwise may be lost to society,
and become victims to the violated laws of their country.
It has already been observed, that it must always be more
grateful to the feelings of a humane magistrate to prevent
crimes than to punish them.  This humane purpose could
not, perhaps, be more effectually promoted than by such
a scheme.  The dread of solitary confinement, and the
shame of being thus exposed in a district where they are
known, would operate in many instances as a powerful
preventive.  It may be proper, before concluding this ac-
count, to observe, that though it is much to be regretted,
that there are too many instances of idleness and dissipa-
tion arising from causes already assigned, yet these
vices are by no means the general characteristic of the
people.  In hospitality, and other offices of humanity, they
yield to none, and there are many among them who are
exemplary, no less for their industry, sobriety, and de-
cency of manners, than for a strict observance of every
moral and religious duty, acting at once the part of good
subjects and pious Christians*.
