where agriculture seems to be brought to the highest state of
improvement, we see extensive farms in the possession of
tenants who appear as gentlemen, and are able to live in afflu-
ence and splendour.  Experience however undeniably proves
that those situations in life which admit of luxury, are un-
favourable to happiness.  And in these places the distance be-
tween master and servant is so very great, that though the lat-
ter may enjoy a present subsistence, yet he can have little or no
hope of bettering his circumstances to such a degree, as to rise
to independence, and obtain possession of a farm himself.
Such extensive farms are also unfavourable to the population
of the country.
   Let us next attend to those places where manufactures have
been introduced.  There the necessaries and conveniencies of
life are procured with facility.  Abundant scope is given to
exertion.  And riches pour on all who are willing to labour.
But these disproportioned rewards of labour generally tend to
enervate the sinews of industry, softer idleness, introduce a
total relaxation of morals, and consequently lead to poverty
and wretchedness*.  Population indeed appears to increase
with rapidity; but its progress is arrested by disease, which
seems to fix its abode in those extensive work-houses that are
employed in manufactures.  In the cotton works particularly,
children become able to support themselves almost as soon as
they are able to speak or walk.  But their wan and sickly as-

opulence.  Their money is dissipated as fast as it is gained.  Hence the
wretchedness of such multitudes of this description, in consequence of the
late stagnation of trade.
