which enable them to do so. Destitute children alre kept at school
by the heritors and kirk-session. There are two Sabbath schools
in the parish, which are taught, the one by the minister, and the
other by two of the elders. A mortification by Hector Foord of
Branxion provides for six college bursaries-a preference to be
given, failing his own relations and persons of his own name, to in-
dividuals born or educated in the parishes of Innerwick or Dunbar.
   Libraries.-A parish library has existed here for several years.
There are also two small itinerating libraries,-the one stationed at
Innerwick, the other at Thorntonloch. Those who avail them-
selves of these means of improvement are fewer than might be
wished.
   Poor.-At present 18 persons derive regular assistance from
the poor funds. Occasional aid is also granted. These sup-
plies are given from the interest of L. 1000 laid out on security,
together with the church collections. As to the source from which
the principal sum was obtained there is some uncertainty. It ap-
pears, however, from the session books, that, according to an Act
of the reign of James VII., the stipend of crops 1698 and 1699
was mortified by William Nisbet of Dirleton for the repair of the
bridge of Edencain, and the assistance of the poor of lnnerwick-
the annualrent of the balance, laid out on security, to be devoted
to the latter object.
   Fuel.-Peat and coal are, both used as fuel. Coals are brought
from Fife and Bo-ness to the harbour of Skateraw. A few months
ago a ton cost about 12s.,  There has lately been a considerable
advance of price.
   Alehouses.-Of these there are 2 in this parish; the one in
the village of Innerwick-the other at Thorntonloch bridge, on the
Landon road.
