and evident.  It is long before the tide of opinion turns in
favour of management plainly advantageous in the highest
degree.  The writer of this report remembers the time in
which there was scarcely a turnip field to be seen in North-
umberland, Roxburghshire, or Berwickshire, where such
fields are now so much and so justly valued.  The fallow
preceding the turnip, and the turnips themselves, being of
such high consequence to a wise system of agriculture, it
cannot be doubted that the people will loon fall into the
general use of this crop.  Those who hold this reasoning
very cheap, perhaps remember when their fathers (like
some people in Yorkshire now) thought themselves well
employed in paring and burning their fine land.
   This practice is everywhere reprobated in Galloway,
where burning is never performed but in deep mosses.
The present aversion to turnip and fallowing, will soon
share the same fate.  The good sense of the people, and
their increasing attention to potato crops, persuade me of
this.  Potato crops are valuable, but not in the same de-
gree with turnip, as they do not allow so much time for
fallowing, and as the potato remains in the ground till the
feed is ripe.  This last circumstance exhausts the soil.
   Fallows were so much valued in the days of Virgil, that
they were sometimes continued through two seasons.

     "Illa seges demum votis respondet avari
     "Agricolae, bis quae solem, bis frigora sensit,
     "Illius immensae ruperunt horrea messis."

     
     "That crop rewards the greedy peasant's pains,
     "Which twice the sun and twice the cold sustains,
     "And burists the crowded barns with more than pro-
     "mis'd gains."
