that this parish was the scene of the tragical song, known by
the name of Gill Morice.  The Carron was once distinguished
by a cascade called Auchintillin's spout.  It is now distin-
guished by a very extensive iron manufactory in the parish of
Larbert.
   The Forth is the only great river with which we are con-
cerned.  It forms the boundary of the parish on the north.
The length of the river from Gargunnock where it meets, to
Kersey where it leaves this parish, is more than sixteen miles,
though the distance betwixt these places does not in a straight
line exceed half that extent.  The windings of the Forth have
been remarked and admired by every traveller of taste; but
whilst they beautify the country, they render the navigation of
the river peculiarly tedious.  A minute description of the
Forth seems altogether unnecessary, as the Forth or ancient
Bodotria is sufficiently known to every student of British
history.
   Loch Coulter, the only considerable loch in the parish, ex-
tends about two miles in circumference.  It abounds with
perches and eels, and lies in the muirland part of the parish.
It is currently reported, on the evidence of witnesses still alive,
that about twenty-four years ago, by some convulsion of na-
ture, a stone weighing nearly a ton was thrown from its bed
in the loch to the distance of some yards to the northward.
   The Carron frequently overflows a considerable tract of
meadow and some arable land on its banks.  Some of the low
lying lands on the banks of the Forth are subjected to the
overflowings of the river.  A considerable farm called Boll-
for-nought, probably from its being gained from the Forth, is
particularly subject to this inconvenience.  The wall with
which it is surrounded has sometimes been broken down by
the weight of the water, and the greater part of the land over-
flowed.
