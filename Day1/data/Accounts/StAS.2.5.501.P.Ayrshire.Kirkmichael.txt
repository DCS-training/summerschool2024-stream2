is an excellent and commodious family residence. Contiguous is
a natural lake of five acres extent, which shows to great advantage
from the house. The extensive and judicious improvements lately
made on the grounds will serve to beautify a spot, in itself of great
natural amenity. There are some splendid trees within the policy,
and very thriving plantations, throughout the estate.
  There is a local tradition, besides some proofs from ancient do-
cuments, that Blairquhan is within the original land-marks of this
parish. Convenience, no doubt, suggests the propriety of its be-
longing to Straiton, and possibly, in this way, the old parochial
connexion may have been altered without further title or deed of
annexation, ecclesiastical or civil. The main part of the beauti-
ful approach to the castle, along the banks of the river, is within
the present admitted boundary of the parish.
