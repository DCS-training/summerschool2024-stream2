     Parish of Old Deer.

     Additional Communications.

     'Old Deer, 16th Jan. 1797.'
     'Sir,
   'It was not till some days after the departure of the ex-
press, that Mr Anderson, our minister, put the papers he
brought into my hands.  As I had the honour of transmit-
ting you an account of this parish, which I was happy to
find met with your approbation, I now return you your pre-
sent queries, with the most exact answers that can be ob-
tained.
   'I have taken the liberty of transcribing, on the other
page, a copy of a kind of bill of mortality, which I have
been endeavouring to make out for this parish.  It has not
yet been continued for a sufficient number of years to serve
as the basis of any calculations; but it is tolerably exact as
far as it goes, and will be auxiliary to any others which you
may receive of a similar kind.  Among other observations
that might be made upon it, one appears at once striking and
melancholy,-that almost one fifth part of us are carried off,
generally in the prime of life, by consumption.  How desir-
able, a remedy for so fatal a disorder!
     'I have the honour to be, Sir,
     'Your most humble servant,
     'G. CRUDEN.'
