      Modern Buildings.-The mansion-houses and offices of Her-
mand were built by the late Lord Hermand about 1797.  Lime-
field and Harburn were built about 1804.  These are large and
commodious houses, well finished, and the surrounding grounds
tastefully laid out and adorned.  Hartwood is a smaller, but a
handsomer house, built about 1807, on a good site, by the father
of the present proprietor.  This, with Harwood, built about 1768,
is in the common form of a good country manse, with a kitchen
attached to the one end, and a room of similar size attached to
the other.  Gaviside, built 1730, is a small but neat house, with
very superior offices attached to it.  Muldren, rebuilt in 1828,
is of the same stamp, and Bents was built about 1825.  Chapelton
was formed in 1780 into a neat one storey house, with good attic
bed-rooms, by the late Mr. Gloag of Limefield.  The other pro-
prietors who live on their property have only small one storey
houses.  The farm-houses and offices on the Harburn estate are of
a superior order.  Some good houses have of late been built on the
estate of Baads & and others are about to be built.  The old man.
