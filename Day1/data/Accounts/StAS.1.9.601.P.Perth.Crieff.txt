which they often fall upon the parish funds.  Including
such as are supplied weekly, 69 persons, all of different
families, appear on the list as occasionally supplied in 1792;
and to these might be added 26 more, who, as well as they, 
have been relieved from other sources of charity.  For
besides the collections, some of the heritors have at times
been very liberal in their donations of meal and money,
or wood for fuel; especially in the winter of that years,
when peats had been lost by the wet summer, and coals
greatly advanced in price, above 400 carts of wood were
given gratis by two heritors, and money advanced by 
others to purchase coals.  There is nothing, indeed, that
the people in general feel more than the difficulty of pro-
curing fuel*.

   Language.- The people speak the English language in
the best Scotch dialect:  although the Gaelic be commonly
spoken at the distance of three miles north, of four west
from Criess, yet no adult natives of the lowland part of 
the parish can either speak or understand it.  They have
not even contracted the peculiar tone of that language, by
their intercourse with the numerous Higland families now

*The poorest families have nothing but sticks and broom, the next
class have a mixture of wood, peats and coals; but those who can afford
it, find coal alone by far the cheapest fuel, though it must be brought
22 miles by land carriage.  As the price, however, of that article is
somewhat advanced at the coal-mine, and the demand there become
greater through various circumstances the rise accidentally produced
mere of late will hardly be removed by the scheme of the fine toll-roads now
in agitation, nor indeed by any thing else, except the succes of those
exertions now making to find coal in this neighbourhood.  Nothing
could be more advantageous to this part of the country than such an ac-
quisition; and next to that, the forming a canal between priess and
Perth, so soon as the progress of manufactures and of other improvements
can afford the needful expense.
