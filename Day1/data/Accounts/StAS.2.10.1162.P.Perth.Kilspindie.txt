                           PARISH OF KILSPINDIE.*

              PRESBYTERY OF PERTH, SYNOD OF PERTH AND STIRLTNG.

                      THE REV.  DAVID BLACK, MINISTER.


                      I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
        THERE were originally two parishes, Kilspindie and Rait;
      but at what period their union took place, has not been ascertain-
      ed: it must have been prior to 1634.   The walls of the church of
      Rait are still standing.
        Extent and Boundaries.--The form of the parish is oblong;
      its length from south-east to north-west, being about 5 miles; and
      its greatest breadth, from south-west to northeast, about 31/2 miles.
      It is bounded on the south and southeast, by the parish of Er-
      rol; on the south-west and west, by Kinfauns; on, the north-west
      and north, by St, Martins and Collace; and on the, east by Kin-
      naird.  The parish lies, partly in the Carse of Gowrie, and partly
      among the  Sidlaw hiIIs, about half-way between Perth and Dtn-
