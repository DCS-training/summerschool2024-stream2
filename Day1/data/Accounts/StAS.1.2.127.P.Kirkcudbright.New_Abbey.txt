the shore are of a deep coarse soil, on a dry bottom, and are
very productive.  In the upper division, among the hills, the
soil lies on a bed of wet, cold, tenacious till; and the harvest
is therefore latter; but, when the ground is well manured, es-
pecially in dry seasons, it produces good crops, though infe-
rior both in quantity and quality to the former.

   Rivers and Lakes.-The river Nith washes the east border
of the parish ofr 2 miles, or thereby, and may be about that
space in breadth when the tide is in; the water rising 15 or
16 sect in spring tides, and making frequent incraochments
upon the shore; though there are evident proofs that the land
has, on the whole, gained considerably.  Vessels of 60 or 70
tons burden come up a buru in the parish, called Newabbey-
Pow, importing lime and shells for manure, and a few coals,
and exporting oats, oat-meal, barley, potatoes, and charcoal
for England and Greenock.  There are three lakes in the pa-
rish; Lochkindar 1 1/4 mile long, and 3/4 of a mile broad, a-
bounding with trouts, and producing bull-rushes and reeds;
the first gathered by chair-makers, and the last by the weavers.
Lochend and Craigend lakes are each about 3/4 of a mile long,
and 1/2 a mile broad; they abound with pike, consequently
have few or no trout in them.

   Mountains.-The S. and S. W. boundary of this parish is a
chain of hills, beginning on the S. W. with Lowris, and end-
ing on the S. and S. E. with Crissell, both steep, high, and rocky
eminences.  Crissell, in particular, has a grand appearance, rising
about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, from whence it is
a mile distant.  On the summit there is a perennial spring of
very fine water; near which is a large heap of stones, called
Douglass cairn, probably from Douglas, Earl of Morton,
who, when he was Lord of the marches, had a castle called
