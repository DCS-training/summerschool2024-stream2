     NUMBER XXII

     PARISH OF MOFFAT.

     (COUNTIES OF DUMFRIES AND LANARK.)

     By the Rev. MR ALEXANDER BROWN.

     Situation, Boundaries, and Name.

   THE principal part of the parish of Moffat lies in the
stewartry of Annandale, now united to the shire of
Dumfries.  Two farms only belong to the shire of Lanark,
and remain under the civil jurisdiction of that county.
   The parish is bounded on the south by Wamphry; on the
east by Ettrick and Line; on the north by Tweedsmuir and
Crawford; on the west by Kirkpatrick-Juxta.  Its greatest
length, from east to west, is about 15 miles; its breadth,
from south to north is 9 miles.  Its form is irregular, parti-
cularly on the west, where it joines Kirkpatrick-Juxta.
   The name is said to be Gaelic, and to signify Long-holm.
The village of Moffat stands by the side of a holm, which,
with a few interruptions, extends full 20 miles along the banks
of the Annan.  There is river in the parish, which is like-
wise called Moffat.  But whether the village derives its
name from the river, or the river from the village, is uncer-
tain.
