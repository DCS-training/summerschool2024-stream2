     PARISH OF BLAIR-GOWRIE.

     (COUNTY OF PERTH.-PRESBYTERY OF MEIGLE.-
     SYNOD OF ANGUS AND MEARNS.)

     By the Rev. Mr JAMES JOHNSTON, Minister.

     Origin of the Name.

   THE name of the parish is BLAIR-GOWRIE, so called
from the village near which the church stands.  In
old papers it is sometimes written Blair-in-Gowrie.  Various
etymologies and interpretations of it have been suggested.
Like many other names of places in the parish, it is probably
Gaelic.  In that language Blaar is said to be descriptive of a
place where muir and moss abound.  Thus Ardblair is the
height in the muir or moss.  The muir of Blair-Gowrie, a-
bounding with moss, is in the near neighbourhood of the vil-
lage.  The Waltown of Blair, the Lochend of Blair, Little
Blair, and Ardblair, are names of places on the borders of the
muir.

   Extent, Situation, Surface, Soils etc.-The extent of it is
considerable, being about 11 English miles long from S. to
N. and in some places not less than 8 miles broad; but, (as
may be seen from Mr Stobie's map of Perthshire), the figure
is irregular, being frequently intersected by the parishes of
Kinloch, Bendochy, and Kittray.  The connected part of it
