     The Statistical Account.

daries of the parish, description of rivers, mountains, and
game, and some other particulars for which that parish is re-
markable-and which were contained in the manuscript.
Abridgers who are unacquainted with the state of the coun-
try, cannot always judge what to omit and what to insert.
When the narrative is very concise, and contains no extrane-
ous matter, the writer has reason to expect that it will not be
curtailed; and when his name is prefixed, he is responsible
to the public.  In making there observations, I have not the
most distant intentions to throw any blame on your conduct,
Which, in this most laborious and patriotic undertaking, justly
entitles you to the most grateful acknowledgments of the
public in general, and of the clergy of the church of Scot-
land in particular, and to the merited esteem of your coun-
trymen in future ages.  They will, however, I apprehend,
justify me, in your opinion, for transmitting you so abridged
an account of this parish, which is neither small nor inconsi-
derable-an account which would have been much more full
and copious, had the limits of your work permitted its inser-
tion.
