than that period, may be inferred from its structure as a house
of defence, in which are many arrow-slits for bows, but no gun-ports
for cannon or other fire-arms, which were introduced into Scotland
about nearly the same era, and were never omitted in fortified
places erected after that time. In this old castle there remains
still quite entire, one of the most perfect specimens of the Saxon
or Norman round arch, that is perhaps now to be met with in
Britain. It is erected over the principal gateway into the house.
A square tower, in one of the corners, is evidently much more an-
cient, as may be concluded not only from the style of the building,
but from the stone being greatly more decayed from the action of
the weather."
	The present Parliamentary constituency of the burgh is 258;
and the muncipal constituency of that part of the burgh within

There are six incorporations of trades, holding under charters or
seals of cause from the magistrates and council, viz. squaremen,
hammermen, coopers, tailors, shoemakers, and weavers. At pre-
sent the numbers of the different trades may be computed as
follows:--Squaremen, about 94; hammermen, 32; shoemakers,
37; tailors, 30; coopers, 4; weavers, 300.
	The principal inns are the Eglinton Arm's Inn and the Queen's
Arm's Inn. There are three annual fairs in Irvine,--first Wednes-
day of January for horses; first Tuesday of May for cows; third
Monday and third Wednesday of August for horses.
	The number of hand-loom weavers in the town and parish of
Irvine is about 400. Their earnings vary according to their re-
spective abilities and steadiness; but the following statement may
be viewed as a fair calculation:--
