and the heating apparatus having since been enlarged, so as to in-
crease the temperature of the blast to 600&deg; of Fahrenheit, and up-
wards, a proportionate saving of fuel is effected, and an immense
additional saving is also acquired by the use of raw coal instead of
coke, which may now be adopted by thus increasing the heat of the
blast, the whole waste incurred in burning the coal into coke being
thus also avoided in the process of iron-making. By the use of
this invention, with three-sevenths of the fuel which he formerly
employed in the cold air process, the iron-maker is now enabled to
make one-third more iron of a superior quality. Were the hot-
blast generally adopted, the saving to the country in the article of
coal would be immense. In Britain about 700,000 tons of iron are
made annually, of which 55,500 tons only are produced in Scot-
land. On these 55,500 tons his invention would save, in the pro-
cess of manufacture, 222,000 tons of coal annually. In England
the saving would be in proportion to the strength and quality of the
coal, and cannot be computed at less than 1,320,000 tons annual-
ly, and taking the price of coals at the low rate of 4s. per ton, a
yearly saving of L. 308,400 Sterling would be effected. Nor are
the advantages of this invention solely confined to iron-making.
By its use, the founder can cast into goods an equal quantity of
iron in greatly less time, and with a saving of nearly half the fuel
employed in the cold air process; and the blacksmith can produce
in the same time one-third more work, with much less fuel than he
formerly required. In all the processes of metallurgical science,
it will be found of the utmost importance in reducing the ores to a
metallic state.

<FOOTNOTE>Exclusive of the above furnaces, there were in preparation in June 1835, six ad-
ditional, viz. three at Gartsherrie one at Monkland; one at Calder, and one at Dun-
divan. These six furnaces will make 18,000 tones of iron annually.
