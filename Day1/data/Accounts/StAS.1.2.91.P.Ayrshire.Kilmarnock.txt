     of Kilmarnock.

As Abbot of Kilwinning, to whom the patronage of KIlmar-
nock originally belonged, disponed it to Robert Lord Boyd;
from one of whose successors it was purchased by an Earl of
Glencairn; from whose family it was lately acquired by Miss
Scot of Scotstarvet.-There are two established ministers.
The living of the first is wholly paid in meal:  the quantity
is eight chalders, wanting a boll; and, with a glebe of 12
acres, may be worth L. 120 per annum.  The second charge,
including a small glebe of 4 1/2 acres, may be calculated at nearly
L. 105.

   Heritors.-The number of heritors in the parish is about
24; but, excepting Colonel Crawfurd of Crawfurdland, no
considerable proprietor resides in it.  The greater part of the
parish is the property of Miss Scot, who has lately made ve-
ry extensive purchases in this neighbourhood.-It is a sin-
gular circumstance, in regard to the Crawfurland family,
that its present respectable representative, is the twenty-first,
Lincally descended from the original stock, without the inter-
vention of even a second brother.  The Countess of Loudoun,
another proprietor, represents the ancient family of the Muirs
of Rowallen; from whom the greater part of the sovereigns
of Europe are descended; Robert III. king of Scotland, being
the son of Robert II. by Elizabeth Muir, daughter of Sir A-
dam Muir, of Rowallen.

   State of the Poor.-The poor, in such a large and populous
parish, it is to be expected, must be very numerous, and 
would require a considerable sum for their support.  The so-
cieties and incorporations are of great service in maintaining
their indigent and distressed members, and thereby keeping
them from being a burden upon the public.  They distribute
annually, among their poor and afflicted brethren, L. 180.
