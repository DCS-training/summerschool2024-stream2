have ever been seen in this parish, though in the High-
lands, in the near neighbourhood, they are sometimes to be
met with. We have partridges in great abundance; in
the west end of the parish grouse are common; the black-
cock too, has there sometimes been seen.  We are likely
to have more of these some years hence; for, according
naturalists, corn and young plantations always attract them.
Herons are to be seen through the whole year on the
banks of the Annan.  Besides the cuckoo and swallow, we
have am annual visit from the bullfinch, who makes great
havock of gooseberries and currants in May.  The wood-
lark and fieldfare are very common.
