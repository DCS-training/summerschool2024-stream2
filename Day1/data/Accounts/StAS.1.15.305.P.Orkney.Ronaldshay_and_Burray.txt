the only fishery that is prosecuted in Orkney.  This fishing
generally begins in March, and continues until June; begins
again in October, and continues until December.  Orkney-
men are employed to catch the lobsters, and the smacks call
weekly to receive them.  They cannot be caught in the day
time.  Two men in a small boat, in the night, may catch
from 50 to 100, more or less, each night, and they receive

part of the year, and learn, during the other part of it, ha-
bits of idleness and extravagance, it is, upon the whole, doubt-
ful whether it be useful or not to the country.

   High Rocks and Curious Stones.-In South Ronaldsay there
are three headlands or rocks, presenting a bold front to the
ocean, called Barsick Head, on the west side; Halero Head

inches thick.  About these stones conjecture is silent, and e-

   Antiquities.-The Roman Catholic Religion had once a
firm footing in these isles.  In those days, South Ronald-
say was the deanery of Orkney, and its clergyman provost of

ruins of 7 old chapels.  It is believed that some of them
were erected by mariners, who, despairing of life in tempests
at sea, vowed to build a church on their arrival at the first
harbour.
   At the chapel near St Margaret's Hope, burnt earth and
stones, pieces of deer's horns, and human bones, have been
