     NUMBER VI.

     PARISH OF SPROUSTON.

     By the Rev. Mr ROBERT TURNBULL.

     Situation and Surface.
 
   THIS parish is situated in the county of Tiviotdale, pres-
bytery of Kelso, and synod of Merse and Tiviotdale.
It is about six English miles long, and four broad; being
bounded by the parish of Carham, in England, and by Yet-
holm, Linton, Kelso, Ednam, and Eccles, in Scotland.  That
part of it which lies by the side of the Tweed is flat, and
liable to be overflowed; and the corn is frequently swept off
the ground.  The southern part of the parish is higher ground,
though not hilly.  The soil, by the side of the Tweed, is ex-
cellent, and very fertile:  No part of the parish, however, is
barren.

   Cultivation, Produce, and Rent.-Corn of all kinds, clover,
rye-grass, flax, turnip, cabbage, and most sorts of garden ve-
getables, are raised in this parish.  Oxen and sheep are fed
on turnip with considerable profit.  The magnitude of farms,
which of late have been increasing, is reputed a grievance.  A
farm was lately let at L. 1: 7: 0 per acre.  The valued rent of the
parish is L. 13,263 : 6 : 8 Scots; the real rent is about L. 4350
Sterling.  There are four possessors of landed property; but
