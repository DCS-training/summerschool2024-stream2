years of age to 60, that were not engaged in the rebellion,
their number amounted to 490.  There was a garrison kept
by the rebels in Down castle, which is separated from this
parish only by the river Teath.  This circumstance renders it
probable that the 50th man, or 10 in whole, would be engag-
ed in the rebellion, consequently, that the number of men
then in the parish, above and below 60 years of age, was 500,
and that the number of souls was 2000.  The return to Dr.
Webster in 1775, however, was only 1250.-The number at
present is 2068.

The number of baptisms, at a medium of seven years
from the commencement of the register in 1696, was
annually                                                    33
Of seven years after 1731,                                  46
Of seven years after 1746,                                  44
Of seven years after 1770,                                  40
Of the seven years preceeding 1792,                         48
But according to the computation of the keeper of the re-
gister, there are about 6 baptisms yearly not registered,   
consequently, the annual average during the last period
is                                                          54
The number of parishioners married at an average of the
three last years of last century was yearly                 13
Of 1731,- 32, and - 33                                      23
Of 1749,- 50, and - 51                                      26
Of 1770,- 71, and - 72                                      19
Of 1784,- 85, and - 86                                      36

   A reason, that may be assigned for the number of marriages
not increasing of late, in proportion to the supposed increase of
population, is, that the great part of the moss tenants were 
married before they settled in this parish.
