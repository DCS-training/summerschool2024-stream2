practice of letting their carts and horses for hire for various
purposes, particularly for bringing coals to the inhabitants
either from the harbour or the neighbouring collieries.

   Minerals.-In former times coal has been wrought both
in the east and west fields of Crail.  Vestiges of the pits
and mines are easy to be traced.  It is probable that no
machinery was used, and that the crop-coal only, where it
was level free, has been exhausted.  In times of scarcity,

quantities.  There are several quarries of it in the interior
part of the parish, upon the town's moor, and the lands of
Newhall, belonging to the Honourable Henry Erskine.
But though it is of a pretty good quality, yet, owing to its
great depth, the working of these quarries has been pro-
ductive of little profit to those who have opened them.
There is plenty of freestone; but, in general, it is by no

The name formerly written Carle, Caryle and Carraille,
is supposed to signify, in the Gaelic, its situation upon a

old historians, it is mentioned as a town of considerable
note, so early as the middle of the 9th century.  It consists
of two parallel streets, extending east and west along the
