confined to two or three farms, and serve only to show what
the country might produce, were it in the hands of persons
who had abilities or encouragement to improve.

   Rent, Services, Etc.-The rent of the parish is upwards of
1000 l. Sterling, divided into farms of different extent, from
70 l. to 8 l. a year, partly paid in money, and partly in oat-
meal.  It may be proper to mention, among other causes
that retard improvement, that leases are only granted for 19
years, and some for a shorter period; that besides the rent,
as above specified, several services are exacted of the tenants,
such as leading fuel, cutting down corn in harvest, and other
exactions of a similar nature, which, if viewed in a proper
light, are more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial to the
proprietor.
   These remains of feudal vassalage are mentioned with re-
luctance; and it is to be hoped, that the good sense of the
proprietors will lead them to vie with one another in remo-
ving every restraint on industry, and consider it as their ho-
nour, as it is certainly their interest, to see their tenants
thriving and independent.  For this purpose, besides an al-
lowance to build comfortable houses, make substantial inclo-
sures, and plant trees and hedges, no lease should be for a
shorter period than two 19 years and a life; and thirlage,
and every other service, should be abolished.
   Flax answers well in this parish, and considerable quanti-
ties of it are raised annually.  Barley and oats are the prin-
cipal produce of the country.  The late harvests, for some
years past, have discouraged the growth of peale; but, in
ordinary years, they are very productive, both in point of
corn and provender for cattle, and as an excellent prepara-
tion for a crop of barley.
