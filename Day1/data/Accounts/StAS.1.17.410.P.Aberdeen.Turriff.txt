already three, one turned by water and two by horses, be-
gin to be introduced into the parish.
   Peat and turf are principally used for fuel.  Though there
is very little of it in the parish, most of the people have a
right to moss in some of the neighbouring parishes; a
right which heritors were formerly careful to secure to their
tenants; when the moss to which they had such right is ex-
hausted, which is the case with respect to some estates in
this parish, recourse is had to coals, broom, or to buying
peat at the rate of 10 s. 6 d. for spade's casting, i. e. for as much
peat as can be laid and dried upon 480 ells square.  The
more expeditious methods of carrying on work do not now,
as formerly, make it necessary to employ the whole summer
in bringing home fuel; nor, since improvements in farming
began, can so much time be afforded for that purpose; but
the time necessarily consumed in providing peat, and the dif-
ficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply in wet seasons, make
this a very expensive article, and point out the propriety of
the late salutary repeal of the coal tax.
   Mr Garden of Troup, who in many respects shews a laud-
able desire of encouraging agricultural improvements and
promoting the good of the country, has lately inclosed and
planted with forest trees about 600 acres of barren ground
on his estate in this parish Plantations of the same kind,
though less extensive, have been made on the estates of Laith-
ers, Muiresk, and Gesk.  At Balquholhe, called Hatton Lodge,
there is a considerable quantity of wood of a more advanced
growth; but it will be long before the parish can supply it-
self with this article.
   One of the greatest disadvantages of this parish is the want
of stones; of which few are to be found above ground fit
for building and of which there is only one quarry of any
consequence as yet discovered.  Hence the want of inclosures,
