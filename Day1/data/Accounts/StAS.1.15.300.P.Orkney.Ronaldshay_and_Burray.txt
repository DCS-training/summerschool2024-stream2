which, it is computed, there pass, at an average, nine vessels
daily.  Near this Pentland Skerry, there are two or three
other skerries or rocks, on which there is not nourishment
for any tame living creature.

   Soil and Produce.-The arable ground in these isles is situated
along the shores.  The soil in Swinna is shallow, composed of
some black earth, gravel, and sand.  The soil of Burray may,
in general, be called a light dry sand, mixed in a few places
with some coarse clay.  In the month of July, the bear and
oats in it promise a rich crop; but in August or September,
when the ear demands a greater degree of nourishment, it is
refused; the consequence of which is, that the grain is ill fil-
led, small, and hungry But in no part, perhaps of the king-
dom, can there be seen a richer or more beautiful crop of
natural grass mixed with white and red clover.  Potatoes,
turnips, pease, onions, carrots, cabbages, grow on it to great
perfection.  It is the sole property of Sir Thomas Dundas,
and it is let in tacks to his factor, who has very much im-
proved his breed of cattle, by raising a great abundance of as
excellent turnips as can be found in Scotland.  Glimsholm,
and particularly Burray, abounds with rabbits.  It is com-
puted, that they produce annually about 2000 skins.  The
soil of South Ronaldsay is extremely various in different
parts of the island, and even different in the same field.  It
consists of clay, black loams, sand, and moss In some pla-
ces, the soil is of an excellent quality, but almost every where
shallow.  In all the Orkney isles, the plough generally touches,
a rocky or gravelly bottom.  For want of inclosurers, there
is no sown grass:-But large quantities of ground have, from
time immemorial, been left to produce natural grass, on
which the horses and cattle are tied throughout the sum-
