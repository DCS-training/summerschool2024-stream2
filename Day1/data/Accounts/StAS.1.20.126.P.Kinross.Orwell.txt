     NUMBER VI.

     PARISH OF ORWEL.

     (COUNTY OF KINROSS, SYNOD OF FIFE, AND PRESBY-
     TERY OF DUNFERMLINE.)

     Name, Situation, and Extent.

   THIS parish, from the earliest public records, was called,
what it is to this day, Orwel.  From whence it deri-
ved this name is entirely unknown. The various accounts
from tradition, from whence it derived this name, are so fa-
bulous, as to exceed the belief of even the most credulous
antiquarian.
   This parish is better known in the neighbouring pa-
rishes, by the name of the village in which the kirk and
manse are situated, viz. Millnathort, vulgarly called Mills-
a-forth; from mulean, a mill, and atbart, across, or over;
both Gaelic words, and which are perfectly expressive of the
real situation of the town; a mill being placed upon a rivu-
let, which nearly equally divides the village.
   This parish, as mentioned above, is situated in the shire
of Kinross, presbytery of dunfermline, and synod of Fife.
