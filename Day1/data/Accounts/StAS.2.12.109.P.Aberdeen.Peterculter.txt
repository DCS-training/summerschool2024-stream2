	In one of the plantations on Binghill, there is a Druid's tem-
ple enclosed with a common stone dike; and near to it there is
a large tumulus, which is said to have been once the burying-place
of the family of Drum, a property in a neighbouring parish, where
the descendants of that family now reside.

                           III.-POPULATION.
	In the year 1755, the population of the parish was 755
                       1793,                                 1002
                       1811,                                 1010
                       1821,                                 1096
                       1831,   males, 593; females, 630      1223
	The increase of the paper manufactory, to be afterwards men-
tioned, having attracted to it 60 work people with their families,
may account in part for this small increase in population. Other
local causes are likewise assignable, such as the reclaiming of waste
lands, &c.

         Agriculture.-Though it is impossible to estimate exactly (owing
to the want of recent measurements and plans of the various
estates,) the number of acres of cultivated and uncultivated sur-
face in the parish, as well as the number under wood, yet the
following statement has been prepared with considerable care, and
may be taken as near the truth:

<TABLE>
          Number of acres cultivated,              5686 Imperial.
                        uncultivated,              2404
                        under wood, planted,       1600

         Rent.-The rent of land varies very much from 15s. to L.3 per
Scotch acre, the average may be from L.l to L,1, 15s. per
Scotch acre. The average rent of grazing a full-grown ox or
cow and keep during the year is about L.6.
         Live-Stock.-The common breed of black-cattle is a cross of
the Aberdeenshire with the polled Angus and Galloway breedes.
