labours under another disadvantage.  No gentleman resides
in it, who can act in a judicial capacity.  There are 2 or 3
sheriff officers; but no judge warranted to decide any cause
of a civil nature.  Hence, some disputes of the most trifling
nature cannot be determined, till application is made to one 
of the justices of peace on the coast side, or to the sheriff of 
Dornock.

   Miscellaneous Observations-In the lower part of the parish,
the people in favourable years, can raise crops, which not
only supply themselves with provisions. but enable them to
dispose of bear, oat meal, and potatoes for seed to the High-
landers in the to of the district, where the lands are bad,
an 1 more subject to blasting and mildew.  But the cattle on 
the might grounds are far better, larger in size, and more
valuable in every respect.  Accordingly, as much dependence
is place, on them, as the inhabitants of the strath have on
the quantity and quality of their crops.  A great deal of hay is
likewise raised in their meadows; but this crop is exposes to
much hazard, and requires much labour, as it must be car-
ried off the field as soon as cut, to prevent the risk of inun-
dations.  In the years 1782, and 1783, and some of the
suble some years, the crops were often blasted and destroyed
with frosts and mildews, which set in early in autumn.  Such
lands as lay nearest still bodies of water, as large ponds, were
not subject to this calamity; and consequently, such lands
as were furthest removed from them, or were contiguous to
the most rapid streams of the river, escaped much better.
There is a little Highland place, north of the Strath of Kil-
donan, called Costaly. which yielded some found wholesome
turn, when there was scarcely a peck of good meal in all the
rest of the parish.  In these years, the guardians of the 
Costaly Sutherland, then a minor, suppied her tenants
