occasioned by stagnated water.  The soil is various, but in
general good; in the northern part, it is a loam above a
free-stone; in some of the centrical parts, it is remarkably
rich and fertile, and lies above lime-stone; near the sea,
the soil is sandy, and what is now converted into arable, was
formerly an extensive rabbit warren; there are also many
large tracts of flow moss in this parish, not capable of im-
provement, unless at an enormous expence.

   Population.-In 1755, the population was rated at 631.  It
is probable that this estimate was inaccurately made.  The
examinable persons, above 8 years of age, amount, by a late
account taken of them, to 845, amongst whom are included
some transient people, who are employed in the lime works
at Kilhead.  Notwithstanding the quantity of waste or com-
mon land brought into culture in this parish, it is doubtful
whether population has increased since the beginning of this
century, as the farms are much more extensive than they
formerly were, and the number of tenants have decreased in
a proportional ratio.  Twenty-five years ago, about 40 peo-
ple, some of them farmers, but mostly labourers and trades-
men, emigrated from this parish to America, enticed by ad-
vertisements, sent from thence by persons who had acquired
large tracts of country, and wished to have it peopled.  The
emigrants, upon their arrival, were miserably deceived and
disappointed, and those of them who had money enough to
pay for their passage home, returned, bewailing their credu-
lity.  There is no town or village in the parish.  It is posses-
sed by 4 heritors, 3 of whom are resident.

   River and Fishings.-The Annan, which bounds this pa-
rish on the east, is the only river; it produces salmon, sal-
mon trouts, and a small fish called hirlings, that are some-
