     Statistical Account

The state of the kingdom at that time might render the
collection of forces in different parts of the kingdom a
measure of great prudence, In 1792, on clearing the
ground of a heap of stones which had been collected up-
on the top of the Crimson, or Cramestone Hill, on the
N. side of the village of Gavintown, several earthen urns,
of different sizes, were dug up.  The urns contained hu-
man bones, but had no inscription upon them.  In the
lands of Middlefield and Crease, there are several coffins
of stone, containing human bones.  On measuring one of
them, it was found to be 3 1/2 feet long, 2 deep, and 2 1/2
broad.  In the neighbourhood of the places where the
coffins are found, there is a field which still retains the
name of Battlemoor.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The people are in general
above the middle stature, and dress, perhaps, better than
their circumstances can well afford.  Three brothers in
the village of Gavintown, without any stock to begin with,
and without friends, have, by the making of shoes, in less
than 20 years, acquired upwards of 800 L. I wish I could
record, that all the workmen of the parish have been
equally economical, industrious, and successful.  Mr. Alex-
ander Low in Wood-end, who rents of the estate of Lang-
ton to the amount of 900 L. a-year, hath, by experiment
and observation, acquired much knowledge of rural eco-
nomy.  He hath greatly improved several of the imple-
ments of husbandry, and is the inventor of a steelyard for
weighing hay, etc., which it does with exactness, and is
easily removed from field to field.  The steelyard is made
by James Allan wright in Gavinton, near Dunse, and sold
by him at 6 L. 6 s.  There are different quarries in the pa-
rish of the best free-stone.  Peat and turf may be had in
