wear. With the exception of some parcels of oats sold to the
home millers, the whole disposable grain of the parish is driven,
partly to Arbroath, but chiefly to Dundee, whence all the coal,
lime, foreign wood, salt, iron, flax, seeds, and groceries, which the
parish requires, are transported with carts. These grievances
would have been completely redressed, had the canal between Ar-
broath and Forfar, projected, surveyed, and estimated by the town-
councils of these  boroughs in 1817, been carried into execution.
But this practicable and useful scheme of inland navigation was
completely overruled, at a county-meeting, by a number of gen-
tlemen who, with a view to promote the trade of Dundee, proposed
the plan of the railway between Dundee and Newtyle, which is now
open and in full operation. But, in consequence of its being opened
towards the western extremity of the county, it is of no benefit what-
ever to this parish. Of this defect the trustees on tbat road are aware;
and, with a view to supply it, are proposing to extend the railway
through Strathmore to Glammis. But although this proposal
were executed, the railway would still be of little benefit to the
parish, because its circuitousness would render the road very long,
and, consequently, would increase the rate of carriage so much,
that there would be little difference between driving to and from
Dundee with carts and the railway waggons. If, on the contrary,
the canal above-mentioned, or a railway between Arbroath and
Forfar, had been executed, they would, on account of their easy
extension to Cupar-Angus, have afforded increased facilities of tra-
velling, and have brought many commercial advantages to all the
neighbouring districts.
