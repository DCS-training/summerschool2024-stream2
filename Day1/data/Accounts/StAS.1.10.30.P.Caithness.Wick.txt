tion of George Earl of Caithness, a charter was granted by
King James VI. of Scotland, of date the 24th September
1589, erecting the town of Wick into a royal borough.  On
the 8th October 1672, his great grandson, another George
Earl of Caithness, disponed the whole Earldom of Caithness,
including the lands and tenements of the town of Wick, to
John Campbell of Glenorchy, afterwards created Earl of
Breadalbane; by whole successor in title it was sold in 1718,
to the family of Sinclair of Ulbster.  On a general order from
the convention of Royal Burghs, the set or government of
the borough of Wick, was ultimately fixed in 1716, by which,
in all time coming, the consent of the original founders of
the borough, and their successors, was declared to be neces-
sary to the election of magistrates.  By this fet, the old ma-
gistrates make out a leet, consisting of two out of which a
Provost, four out of which two bailies are to be chosen, by
the burgesses on the roll, and the leet must be presented
30 days before Michaelmass, to be aproved of by the supe-
rior.  The Provost and the two bailies thus elected, have the
right of chosing seven councillors, a treasurer, and dean of
guild.  In consequence of these regulations, Sir John Sinclair
of Ulbster, and his predecessors, have annually been in the
practice, of approving a leet, presented to them, of the ma-
gistrates to be chosen.  Wick is one of five burghs each of
whom chuses a delegate for returning a member to Parlia-
ment for the northern district.  The income or common
good of the town is very trifling, but it is on the increase, and
arises from the Customs payable on different articles fold at
market, those dues on ships, etc.  The borough pay, no sti-
pend, nor school master's salary, nor has it any real property
in the church.  Its tolbooth is seldom occupied by prisoners,
except for petty riots; and a very few for civil debts.
