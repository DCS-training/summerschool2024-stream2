through the parish, is skirted on both sides with belts of
planting, which render them pleasant in summer, and warm
in winter.

   Distempers.-It cannot be said that part of the coun-
try is liable to distempers peculiar to itself.  The rheuma-

and laborious.

   Minerals.-There are several mineral springs in the pa-

iron mine was discovered in a hill, about a mile distant from
the church to the north west; the iron stone has been tried
and found to be so rich, as to yield thirteen twentieths of 
iron, and so near the surface of the ground, that it can be
taken out at a comparatively small expence.  The road to it
is at present passable, and with little trouble can be made
easy, as the carts from the neighbouring farms draw the
fuel from the dyke which inclosed the hill, at a hundred
yards distance from the opening which has already been
made into the mine.  The reason of its not being wrought,
is the scarcity of fuel in this part of the country.

   River.-The river Don runs through this parish, and di-
vides it into two unequal parts, leaving two thirds on the
south, and one-third on the north of its banks.  It is not

parts, and having a fall within two miles of its mouth, which is
