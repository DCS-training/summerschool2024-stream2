in a worse condition than either.  As they are obliged to
depend for ploughing their land, either upon hiring, or
joining with some of their neighbours, they frequently miss
the proper season; and as the produce is usually consumed
by their families, they can seldom, without much difficulty,
afford to pay even a very moderate rent.  Thus they struggle
on from year to year, without either improving their pos-
sessions, or making any comfortable provision for their fa-
milies.  They contribute to the population of the country
indeed, but, in other respects, they contribute, I fear, but
little either to its happiness or improvement.  In the pos-
session of land, whether by property or lease, it should seem,
that there is a certain medium which is most favourable to
the industry and comfort of the possessors themselves, and
to the general improvement and produce of the country.
Though it be undoubtedly desirable, that there should be
both properties and farms of various dimensions, yet the
nearer the generality of both approach to this medium, the
interest of the community at large will probably be so
much the better secured and promoted.  Upon the whole,
this parish, in order to arrive at the highest degree of rural
improvement of which it is capable, seems to have little
more to do but to avail itself, to the utmost, of its natural
resources, and to extend and perfect those plans which are
already begun and considerably advanced.

   Antiquities.-On the northern, though not the highest part
of Blackside-end hill, there is a large cairn of stones, with-
out any mixture of earth, which, I think, is rather an un-
common circumstance.  At the base, this cairn is about 250
feet in circumstance, and its height above the surface of
the ground 10 feet.  The stones, which, as far as appears,
are not large, have, with no small labour, been collected
from the hill, and from the bottom of pretty deep chasms
