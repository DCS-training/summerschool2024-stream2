  Manufactures.-In the town of Leslie, weaving is carried on to
a very considerable extent, there being 260 weavers in it. The
most of the work is supplied from Glasgow,-being plain linen and
cotton checks. A good weaver can only earn at the rate of 1s. per
day, working twelve or fourteen hours. There are six flax mills
in the parish, employing altogether upwards of 200 people. In
these mills, they are employed twelve hours per day, or seventy-two
hours in the week. The men's wages average from 15s. to 18s.

can be engaged in. The workers in the mills have by no means
