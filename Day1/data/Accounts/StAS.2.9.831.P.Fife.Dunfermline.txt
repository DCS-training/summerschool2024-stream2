partakes more or less of the caking quality and soft texture of the
Newcastle coal. It is easily ignited, possesses great heat and du-
rability, and produces very few ashes of a brown colour, which
renders it cleanly and economical for all purposes.
  A new pit was completed at the end of the year 1839, 105 fa-
thoms deep, named the " Wallsend Pit,"* which has entirely su-
perseded the use of the Baldridge pit in the vicinity. It is the
deepest coal shaft in Scotland, and probably one of the most va-
luable. It is very productive, yielding at present as much coal as
all the other pits together previously did at any one time.
  Subjoined is a section of the different strata in this pit, showing
the order of their superposition and succession, as well as the
thickness of each. As the shaft is sunk in the bottom of an el-
liptical basin, the general dip of the strata is towards the shaft, as
to a common centre from all directions, except the north, where
the segment of the basin is cut off by a dike. The general angle
of the dip will be from 16\d to 20\d.+

<FOOTNOTE> The common name Wallsend means the end of the wall of Severns, on the north-
ern bank of the Tyne, a few miles below Newcastle, where the best coal is got.
