   General Improvements.-In 1760, a piece of uncultivated
moor ran across the whole parish from west to east, consist-
ing of between 500 and 600 acres, and yielding nothing but
heath, broom or whin (furze). In 1761, it was divided by sub-
mission, amongst the adjoining proprietors, and now no part of
it is uncultivated.  About 200 acres of it are covered with fine
thriving plantations of fir and larix, from 30 years old and
upwards; about as much is under the plough, and the rest
laid out in beautiful grass parks, and makes part of the estate
of Mylnefield, improved by the present proprietor at a very
great expence, almost equal to a purchase of the ground, but
which is worth now from 40 s. to 45 s. per annum.
   That part of it which fell to the estate of Castle-Huntly,
was either planted with fir, larix, and other trees, or let to
tenants; to some of whom lime was given by the proprie-
tor, at the rate of 45 bolls per acre *, and to others marl, at
the rate of 50 bolls per acre +, to enable them to improve the
ground.  So that what was scarce worth any thing before
the division, twenty years ago, was let at 5 s. per acre, and
now gives 20 s. and 25 s. and upwards.  But the rise of
rent was gradual, as the improvement of the land enabled
the tenant to pay.
   Formerly the hills, and all the upper part of the parish,
were one continued uninclosed moorland surface, with
scarce a habitable house upon them.  The proprietors then
were either unable or unwilling to lay out money upon
their estates, and were happy to get tenants who had mo-
ney to spend and a spirit to improve; therefore, to such,
they were willing to give long leases, as the only means,
without experience to themselves, of reimbursing the tenant
for his time, trouble, and expence, while their estates were
