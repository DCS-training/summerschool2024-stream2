   In 1838 a return was made by all the parishes in Scotland, to
certain queries proposed by Her Majesty's Government, with the
view of obtaining information respecting the state and manage-
ment of the poor in that part of the island.  Referring to the an-
swers for Greenock, let us now compare the numbers of the poor
and the money expended for their relief in 1837, with the num-
bers and expenditure in 1810.
   In 1810, the population was 19,000, and the total expenditure
L. 1630, 7s. 11d.  In 1837, the population was 28,000, expendi-
ture L. 3668, 15s. 10d.  In 1810, the number of poor on the per-
manent roll was 503, on whom were expended. L. 1272, 3s. being
on an average L. 2, 10s. 6d. to each panper-dependent on them,
326.  In 1837, the number of the same class was 1061, on whom
were expended L. 2993, 15s. 9d., being on an average L. 2, 16s.
5d. to each pauper-dependent, 527.  In 1810, the number of
poor receiving occasional relief was 305, on whom was expended
L. 304, 12s. 6d., being at the rate of L. 1 to each.  In 1837, the
number of persons of the same class was 981, among whom was
distributed the sum of L. 395, 17s. 5d., being on an average 8s.
to each.  In 1810, the number of orphan children was 21.  In 1887,
178.  In 1810, the income from ordinary collections at the churches
was L. 433, 13s. 8d., and the income from all sources, L. 1814,
3s.  In 1837, the income from ordinary collections was L. 323, 3s.
4d., and from all sources, L.3158, 16s., leaving L.509 19s. 10d.,
the excess of expenditure to be provided for out of the assessment
of 1838.
   We are not at liberty to draw any sweeping conclusions from ex-
periments in the management of the poor funds in any particular
town or parish.  But the writer of this account, attaching no more
than their due weight to the facts which havd now been stated,
trusts that he may be permitted to make the following very obvi-
ous remarks on the comparison which has now been instituted.
   In the first place, the increase of the population between 1810
and 1837 was about one-third.  If, therefore, there was iw wise
and effective administration of the affairs of the poor in the former
of these periods, the increase of the expenditure and of the num-
