sediment must have first subsided; yet it is not observed that
the lapse of ages diminishes either their depth or their extent.
   The truth seems to be, that the effects to be attributed to
running water, in changing the aspect of a country, have al-
ways been proportionably small, and that they necessarily be-
come every day more inconsiderable.  In the first ages of the
world, indeed, whilst the earth was yet recent, the adhesion
of its parts, not yet cemented by the continued operation of
gravity, must have been less than at present; and even the
tenacity which the earth might have acquired, must have
been greatly impaired by the event of the general deluge.
In the more early periods, therefore, there is room to believe
that the revolutions on the surface of our globe must have
been more numerous, and more considerable than they now
are.
   An appearance occurs in the earstern extremity of the pa-
rish, at the farm of Nether Donnans, which seems to coin-
cide with this observation.  It consists of a great number of
regular ridges or mounds, formed of beds of gravel and sand,
and covered with a green sward of fine grass.  They are from
3 to 7, and even 10 feet high, broad at the base, and nar-
rowing gradually to the top.  They run sometimes in a pa-
rallel direction, and sometimes diverge at various angles, for
the length of 200 or 300 yards.  The whole has, at first
fight, the appearance of a Roman encampment, and has by
some been determined to have been one.  But it is un-
doubtedly a Lusus Naturae, formed probably by the river
Forth, before it had scooped out its present channel to it-
self; and which, though its course be now at some distance
from this spot, and its bed considerably lower, seems to have
ranged over this and many of the adjacent fields, before it
had obtained for itself a free passage into the plain below.
