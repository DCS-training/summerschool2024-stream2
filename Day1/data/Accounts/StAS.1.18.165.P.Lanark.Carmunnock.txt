   The farmers here follow the Irish method, and churn the
whole of the milk.  They are of opinion, that the butter
is not so apt to turn rancid, as when the cream, after
having been long gathered, is only churned.  And from
various experiments in different parts of the country, there
seems to be some truth in the assertion.
   The milk of each cow upon an average, will produce
four pounds of butter per week, from the beginning of May,
till the middle month of October, which the farmer sells at
1 s. and never below 10 d. per pound.  The farmer who has
12 milk cows, will therefore, during the 6 summer and har-
vest months, when the grass is most luxuriant, make L. 50
sterling of his butter, and above L. 20 of his butter milk,
which is readily fold in Glasgow, and its neighbourhood, at 3/4
and never less than a halfpenny the Scotch pint, or two
English quarts.
   Though the farmers have a ready market in Glasgow at
all seasons for such necessary articles, as milk and butter,
yet they are not at due pains to keep winter cows in such
order, as to secure such a quantity of milk, as it would
be an object to bring to market.  Feeding with turnip
is seldom practised, though such of the farmers as have at-
tempted this, have found a very good return.  It is how-
ever hoped, that a crop so beneficial in situations where
the milk can be consumed, or the cattle fattened for the
market, will even here be brought into more general prac-
tice.

coal and lime-stone, neither of which has been wrought to
any extent.  There is also iron-stone, Which was once con-
tracked for by the proprietors of the Clyde iron works, but
owing to some failure in the contract, the agreement became
