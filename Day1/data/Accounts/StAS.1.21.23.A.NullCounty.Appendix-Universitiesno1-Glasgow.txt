haps with less propriety, the Faculty Meeting.  The record of
this meeting is visited and authenticated by the rector, dean

Other business of the University, besides matters of revenue,
and the discipline of the students, is managed in what is called

less atrocious crimes, wherein any member of the University
was party.  The university has always maintained its exemp-

since that period.  From the small beginning, derived from
the bounty of that prince, it continued to prosper to the ‘ra
of the Restoration; having, at that time, besides a principal,
8 professors, a librarian, with a tolerable library, the number
of its bursars increased, and an additional number of other
