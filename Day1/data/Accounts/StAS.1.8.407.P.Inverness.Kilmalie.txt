     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF KILMALIE.

     (Counties of Inverness and Argyll.-Presbytery of Abertarph.-
     Synod of Glenelg.)

     By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER FRASER, Minister of that
     parish.

     Origin of the Name.

   FROM the Gaelic, a branch of the Celtic language, are de-
rived the names of places, not only among the mountains
of Caledonia, but in the more campaign counties of Scotland.
Kil signifies a burying place; and Malie mutt have been a person
eminent for piety, or for some other extraordinary quality,
who probably was the first that had been interred in that particular
place, whence the parish receives its name.  This is the more
probable, as it is well known, that, wherever Popery prevail-
ed, its partisans were wont to dedicate their churches, and sa-
cred grounds, to some canonised saint.  And, as a farther evi-
dence, even the modern Highlanders, when their veracity is
suspected, will use the following phrase:  "Air Malie tha,"
i. e. "I swear, or declare, by Malie, that it is as I say."
