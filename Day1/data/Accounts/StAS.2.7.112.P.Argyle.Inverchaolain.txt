land, fortified by Archibald Earl of Argyle, when he made his
unfortunate descent upon Scotland in 1685.  The castle was taken
by his enemies and blown up; but a small portion of it is still
standing, and is seen from the steam-boats passing through the
Kyles of Bute.  This island and adjacent property at that time
belonged to the ancient family of Ellandheirrig, who posses-
sed a large estate in this part of the country, and were celebrated
as warriors in Gaelic song.  They are now extinct.  The island
now belongs to John Campbell, Esq. of Southhall, whose grand-
uncle purchased it, along with what then remained of the property,
from Sir Neil Campbell of Ellandheirrig, the last of that house.
There are tumuli in different parts of the parish.  Several of them
have been opened.  In some, stone coffins containing human bones
were found; in others, earthen urns with black ashes.  Stone cof-
fins containing human bones have been turned up in different parts
of the parish.  In digging the foundation of the present church in
1812, several dozens of human skulls were found, and near them
a few bones of a very large size.  There is a large stone ten
or twelve feet high in the middle of a field at the head of Loch
Striven, but nothing is known about it.
