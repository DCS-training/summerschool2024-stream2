        cause that salmon are at least rare, or of diminished size and modified
        appearance.  Shell-fish are abundant.  Oysters of g6od size and
        flavour occur in many situations.  The limpet is universally used
        as bait for the young coal-fish.  The kullyack (Mactra solida) is
        frequent, burrowing in muddy beaches, sheltered from the surf,
        and is in season early in spring.  Eaten raw it resembles the oys-
        ter in taste, and by many is thought to be more delicate and di-
        gestible.  In the department of marine Invertebrata, an inviting
        field awaits the culture of the naturalist.
           Botany.-Only two plants, not hitherto observed in Scotland,
        have been found in Shetland,-the Pisum maritimum and an are-
        naria, believed to be the Norvegiea.  Both occur in the island of
        Unst only, and were discovered in 1837 by a young and promising
        native botanist.  He has since surveyed botanically the most of the
        islands, and the following is his list of phenogamous plants found
        in them, which is interesting, as being, I believe, the first attempt
        at a regular Shetland flora.
