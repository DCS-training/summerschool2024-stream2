     Statistical Account

the statute-labour, which begins to take place, and the
committing the reparation of these roads to active hands,
will be productive of good effects.  The peat mosses are
distant, and high in the hills; and the roads that lead to
them, are fit only for killing the horses, and dashing the
carts in pieces.  The tenants here, as in many other parts,
are obliged to spend too much of their time in providing
the necessary fuel for the winter.  There is no coal nearer
us than the shore of Perth; the river Tay, broad and deep,
runs between; and there is not a bridge across it, in its
whole course, from Aberfeldy to Perth, i.e. in a course of
upwards of 40 miles.  There is, however, a certain pro-
spect of much benefit accruing to this part of the country,
from the new road marked out from Perth to the river
Ila, and from the bridge that is about to be built across
that river at Meiklour, which will greatly facilitate the
carriage of coal and lime, and other necessary articles from
Perth.
