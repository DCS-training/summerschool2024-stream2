some change.  At first they were remarkable for sobriety:
Their principal food was porridge and potatoes; even milk
and bread was considered as a luxury.  They displayed their
zeal and their learning in declaiming against patronage and
Arminian preaching; and the man who was able to spare
some money to support a dissenting clergyman, came to con-

   Villages.-There are two villages built in the parish, besides

the ground, adjacent to the villages and printfields, is rented

   Soil and Produce.-The parish is all inclosed and subdivid-
ed.  The soil, as in most others, is various.  The low ground,
