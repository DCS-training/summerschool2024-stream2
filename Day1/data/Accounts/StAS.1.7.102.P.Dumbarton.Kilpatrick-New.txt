     Statistical Account

   Hay harvest begins about the middle of June; and corn
harvest sometimes about the middle of August, though com-

vember.  From 200 to 300 stone per acre is reckoned a good
crop of hay, and of oats and barley 7 or 8 bolls.

prejudices against that most successful improvement in the

   There are many instances of longevity.  Within the last
year, there died one man in his 95th year, who was able,
within a few days of his death, to walk in a forenoon above
a mile to a neighbouring farm, and return; another man in
his 89th year; and a woman in her 91st: And these is now
