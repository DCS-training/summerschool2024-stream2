     Statistical Account

   Poor and Schools-The number of poor upon the ses-
sion-roll at present is 29.  But there are a great many
others, who, although they are not considered so very
indigent as to have a claim upon the funds, yet go about
begging among the tenants as often as the rest, and are
as liberally supplied.  The only permanent fund in the
parish, for their supply, is 10 s. Sterling, being the year-
ly interest of money mortified for their behoof, in the
year 1737, by a Mr. Lamont of Kilfinan, who granted
his bond to the session for payment of the above sum,
yearly, in all time coming; together with the various
collections made at church on Sundays, at marriages and
baptisms, with small dues for proclamations, fornication
fines, and fees paid for the mort-cloth.  But their prin-
cipal support is begging; and if the late excellent re-
gulaton that required all poor to keep within their
own parishes, had been properly adhered to, and stran-
gers kept off, our own poor might be tolerably well pro-
vided for.  The funds have been hitherto in the ma-
nagement of the session; but it is uncertain how long
they will continue so, as the session seems now very
desirous to devolve this trouble upon the heritors; which
is indeed but reasonable, as they are the persons who
are liable for the maintenance of the poor*.

more for the interest of the proprietor of the farm and the minister
both, that the grass had been designed, contiguous to the arable part of
the glebe; as, in that case, the one might let his farm to much better
advantage, when freed from the disagreeable burden to which it is now
subjected; and the other, having his whole ground together, might en-
close and improve it to better purpose.
*The session has been in the use of meeting regulary once a year, to
settle with the treasurer, and to distribute among the poor out of their
capital, in such proportions as they could judge most proper, according
