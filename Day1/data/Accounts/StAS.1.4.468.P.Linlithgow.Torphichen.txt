clining.  There is a very considerable quantity of planting, 
consisting of oak, ash, elm, birch, beech and sir, the latter in 
very large quantities; of the other there are some very fine 
trees, both for beauty and value.  There is a poplar the di-
mensions of which were taken about the year 1788, when it 
was somewhat more than 80 feet high, and its circum-
ference within two feet of the ground, 5 feet 11 inches. 
Planting is yearly going on, both for shelter and beauty.
The most part of the parish is inclosed, and the farmers are 
so sensible of the advantages resulting therefrom, that a 
piece of uninclosed land is not easy to be let.  There are a-
bout 30 bolls of wheat sown yearly, 80 of barley, about
80 acres of artificial grasses, and turnip is beginning to be
attended to.  Each family in general plants as many potatoes
as may serve for its own use.  The same may be said of
flax.  It is supposed that about two thirds of the parish are a-
rable, and that the parish supplies itself with provisions, and
about a third more.  Seed-time, in general, for oats, is from
the 1st of March to the middle of April, and from the
1st to the middle of May for barley.  Harvest from 1st Sep-
tember to the middle of October.  The parish has abundance
of fuel and water, for the encouragement of the manufac-
turer, with the additional encouragement of the Cleugh
turnpike road.  There are 3 oat and barley mills, and 2
lint-mills.
