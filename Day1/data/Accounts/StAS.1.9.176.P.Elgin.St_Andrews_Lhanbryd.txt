     Statistical Account

a few pairs only being employed in the plough and wag-
gon; there are 1060 sheep a small number of which are
accounted here of the Bakewell breed.  They are without
horns, and have long wool; the fleece weighs from 7 to
12 pounds; about a fifth part are of the Linton breed,
the rest are a white faced breed, that have always been in
the country, much diminished in bulk by scanty pasture;
as yet there is no idea of improving the quality of the
wool.-Tenants of the rank of gentlemen have all their
grass of sown clovers, rye and rib grass the poor tenants
depend on natural ley grass with a patch of clover in their
gardens.  The rent by the acre on most farm is varied e-
very year, by the difference of the price of grain, of which
a portion of the rent of every farm has been in general
paid.  When grain fells at 14 s. or 15 s. the boll, the a-
verage rent by the acre is about 15 s.; but a great propor-
tion of almost every farm can be only valued at 5 s. the
acre; and a part of each, if let separately, would bring a
guinea the acre.  There being little or no common pasture
pertaining to any farm, the land, considering the quantity
of grain produced from the acre, must be reckoned high
rented.
