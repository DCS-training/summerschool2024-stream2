      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON ROSS AND CROMARTY.          469

and the Island of Lewis. The western coast is indented by many
lochs and bays of the most picturesque description, and often afford-
ing excellent havens.
   The sheriffdoms of Ross and Cromarty were united by the
Jurisdiction Act of 1748.
   The general aspect of the united counties is wild and moun-
tainous,-but diversified by glens, rivers, and lochs. The western
part of the county abounds in pasture of the best quality: but the
agricultural portion of the county is that which extends from Ding-
wall along the Frith of Cromarty, onwards in a north-eastern di-
rection along the Friths of Moray and Dornoch: there, agricul-
ture, having the advantages of a fine climate and fine soil, is of the
very best description, and is nowhere excelled in any part of Scot-
land.
   The landed property of the united counties is valued in the
cess-books at L. 75,O43, 1Os. 3d. Scots. In 1815, the annual
value of real property was rated at L.121,557. The Parliament-
ary constituency in 1839 was 710.
