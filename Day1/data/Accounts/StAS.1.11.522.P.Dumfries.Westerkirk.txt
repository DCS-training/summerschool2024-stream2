pence of the county.  Five of the bridges are thrown over
burns or rivulets, which fall into the Esk from the hills on the
S., and 10 are built over those that come from the mountains
on the N. side of the river.  There are 2 public roads, which
are kept in excellent repair, and run from the S. E. end of
the parish; the one along the S., the other along the N. banks
of the Esk, for about 6 miles.  The road on the S. crosses
the river 2 miles above the church, and, on the N. side of
the Esk, joins the other, which is continued into the parish
of Eskdalemuir.  Though some of the bridges were built,
and the roads were originally formed, and are still kept in re-
pair, with money collected from the occupiers of land, in lieu
of the statute labour, in terms of an act of parliament obtained
for this county, yet the public is much indebted, for the con-
veniency of good roads and sufficient bridges, to the benevo-
lent exertions of Sir JAMES JOHNSTONE.  From him the pro-
position first came to throw a bridge over the Esk, at Lang-
holm, by which the inhabitants of Westerkirk have ready
access to the lime kills and coal pits of Cannobie; and his
attention is unremitted, while he resides in this part of the
country, to the reparation of the roads and bridges.
