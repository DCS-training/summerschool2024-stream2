     of Kiltearn.

situated in obscure corners, at a distance from the public
road.  These last are much frequented by tipplers, and dram-
drinkers, who sometimes sit up whole nights at their debauch.
Such tippling-houses have proved a great nuisance for several
years past, and have been very prejudicial to the health, the
morals, and the circumstances, of several inhabitants of this
parish.  It is not uncommon to see two mechanics, or
day-labourers, repairing once or twice a-day to one of these
ensnaring haunts, and drinking a choppin bottle of unmixed
whisky at each time, with as great case as their forefathers
would drink a Scots pint of twopenny ale, or small beer.
What adds to the grievance is, that the keepers of these cor-
rupting haunts are not always very scrupulous as to the mode
of receiving payment for their drink.  When money fails,
they will receive meal and victual at a low price, which is
often stolen from the mills, and farmers barns.  When this
resource fails, they receive household furniture, and wearing
apparel.  An evil that has come to such a height loudly calls
for the interposition of the civil magistrate; and it is a great
pity that the gentlemen of the district who are justices of the
peace, and are remarkably temperate themselves, have not
made greater excertions to suppress this growing evil.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-As it is the common lot
of mankind to have their condition in this world checquer-
ed with a mixture of good and evil, so it cannot be denied
that the inhabitants of Kiltearn have their own share, both
of the advantages and disadvantages of life.  It is a very fa-
vourable circumstance for this parish, that it is situated on
a beautiful bay, and within four leagues of Cromarty; from
which place there is a communication by sea once every fort-
night to London and Leith.  Besides, there are three several
harbours in the parish, viz. at Balcony, Fowlis, and Ardullie
