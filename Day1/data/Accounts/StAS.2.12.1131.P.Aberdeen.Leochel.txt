merks for " depauperated tenants and their widows" on her son's
lands of Craigievar and Corse; and since her death in 1742, four
bolls of meal have been distributed annually as the interest of this
bequest.  In 1761, John M William, in Briggs of Leochel, mor-
tified 500 merks for the poor of Leochel.  In 1812, Sir Charles
Forbes, Bart. gave L.100 to the poor of the united parish, and,
since 1816, has continued an annual donation of L.10, amounting
in whole to L.270.  In 1827, Miss Anna Forbes, sister of Sir
Charles, left L.100 to the poor of Leochel and Corse.  In,1833,
Peter M'Combie, Esq. of Lenturk, left L. 100 to the poor of the
united parish.  In 1841, Major Mitchell, whose first wife was
another sister of Sir Charles Forbes, left L.200 to the poor of
Leochel, payable after the death of his second wife: and, in 1842,
Peter Ritchie, in Wester Leochel, left L.100, the interest of
which is to be applied to purchase meal for the poor on the lands
of Craigievar and Corse.  In addition, there have been received
from the fund of Mr Burnett of Dens, in 1809, L.25; in 1824,
L.20; in 1834, L.24; and, in 1842, L.39, making a total of
L.108.  It is also proper to state, that much charity is given in
private.
   Fairs.-Five of these are annually held in the parish, in the
months of April, May, July, August, and September, at a con-
venient station on a moor near Scuttrie, on the Craigievar estate.
They are well frequented, and a considerable amount of business
is done in cattle, horses, sheep, and wool.
   Inns.-There is but one regular inn in the parish, excluding
Corse, where there are other two.
   Fuel.-The mosses in the parish are nearly exhausted; and
peat and turf are procured at a great expense of time and labour;
the latter chiefly from the Red-hill of Lumphanan and the Glen
of Cushnie, both distant, and of difficult access.  In consequence
coals from Aberdeen are more and more used.  They cost from
8s. to 10s. per boll, including the price of carriage.

   In preparing this account, the writer was much indebted to the unrestricted
access which he had to the extensive and valuable series of charters and documents
in possession of Sir John Forbes at Fintray House; to a short account of Leochel and
Cushnie, privately printed by Joseph Robertson, Esq., author of the " Book of Bon-
Accord; "  and to communications, both written and oral, from William M'Combie.
Esq. of Lenturk; Messrs Lumsden, Advocates in Aberdeen, factors on the Cushnie
property; Mr George Strachan, factor to Sir John Forbes; Mr William M'Combie at
Tillyfour House; Mr Andrew Ross Tarland, factor on the Hallhead estate; and Mr
John Gray in Ley of Cushnie.
