     Statistical Account

   Church, Stipend, School and Poor.-The church seems to
have been built or renewed in 1678.  The manse and
offices are at present somewhat ruinous.  The value of
the living depending chiefly on victual is in different years
different.  During the 7 years of the incumbent's ministry,
the stipend, at an average, has been L. 115 Sterling a year.
The manse and glebe cannot be estimated, both together,
at more than L. 10 or L. 12 Sterling.-The schoolmaster's
income as schoolmaster, session clerk and precentor, is a-
bout L. 35 Sterling a year.  The number of scholars is
from 40 to 50.-The poor are in general well provided
for.  None of them are reduced to the necessity of beg-

nual average of collections is about L. 23 or L. 24 Ster-
ling.  There are of seat-rents belonging to the poor about
L. 12 Sterling; and there is lying at interest at 4 1/2 per
cent. 200 Sterling.

   Miscellaneous Observations.-The roads in this parish at

to Arbroath, which intersects the lower part of the parish,
is in bad weather almost impassable.  There is turnpike-
road begun to be made, which, though a mile farther south
than the old road, yet being quite straight, will shorten the
distance between these 2 towns.  About 7 years ago, a
road was formed leading from Brechin to Dundee, and
passing through the northern part of this parish.  Upon this
road there was built about 5 years ago, a strong massy
bridge, 55 feet high, with a single arch, over a precipice at
Denfiend, or the Fiend's Den, a place deep and winding.
-Near the 8th mile-stone, E. from Dundee, there is a ridge
of small hills, called the Cur-hills, where within these 14
