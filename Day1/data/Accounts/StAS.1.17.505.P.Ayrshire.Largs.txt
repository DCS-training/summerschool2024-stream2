   The soil of the arable grounds is of two kinds; that on
the south of Nodesdale water, comprehending Lord Glas-
gow's estate, and great part of Mr Brisbane's, is light and
sandy, producing tolerable crops with little culture, if the
season be not immoderately dry, whereas, that on the north
side is a light red kind of earth lying on rocky foundations
of the same colour, and inferior to the former, both for pas-
ture and tillage.
   Neither lime nor coals, worth working, have been dis-
covered in the parish, and cannot be obtained from any place
nearer than Stevenson, which is about 11 miles distant from
the south end of the parish.  Lime, therefore, as it can only
be procured at great expence, is but little used.  The most
common manure is a mixture of sea-weed and dung, or dung
itself, where sea-weed cannot be obtained.
   The fields thus improved, and after lying five or six years
in pasture, yield tolerable crops; and though the quantity of
oats and barley, produced by these means, is, in general less,
than in some of the neighbouring parishes, the meal is gene-
rally equal; a quarter of oats yielding generally 20 pecks of
meal, sometimes more.  The great obstacle to any consider-
able improvements in agriculture is a species of traffic in
horses peculiar to this parish.
   Farmers, mechanics, and even servants, who can afford to
buy a horse, are engaged in it.  Some individuals have from
10 to a dozen of horses, some of them worth 15 L. or 20 L.
for the purpose of hiring them to the farmers in the neigh-
bouring parishes, from 20 to 30 miles round.  They are
usually let out from a guinea to 40 s. according to their
quality, from the first of February, sometimes to the 24th of
March, but most commonly to the 10th of April, when they
are all returned.  Previous to this period, there are few
horses in the whole parish; but after it there are so many in
