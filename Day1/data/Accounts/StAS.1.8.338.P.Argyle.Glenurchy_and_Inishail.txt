   Potatoes.-No where are potatoes cultivated with more care
or thrive better.  They are mostly planted in drills, and hoed
by the plough.  The largest are always selected for seed.
The kinds chiefly used, are those called here, the London Lady,
a prolific and sweet potatoe; the long white, the dun, the
wife, the early red, and the purple.  From all of them, a

   Sheep and Black Cattle-The hills and muirs, which, some
years ago, were covered with heath and coarse herbage, are,

springs and rivulets of pure and salubrious water.  Nume-
rous flocks of large and heavy sheep, now pasture almost the
whole year, on these mountains and wilds, where, formerly,
