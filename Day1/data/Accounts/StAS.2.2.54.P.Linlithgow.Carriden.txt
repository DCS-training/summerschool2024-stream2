                PARISH OF CARRIDEN.
PRESBYTERY OF LINLITHGOW, SYNOD OF LOTHIAN & TWEEDDALE.
          THE REV. DAVID FLEMING, MINISTER.

	I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name.-THE: modern name of the parish is Carriden.  In Gil-
das' "De excidio Britanniae," A.D. 560, it is written Kair Eden.
Foredun, the Scottish historian, who lived about the year 1308,
calls the village that was in existence in his days Karedin; and
in Richard of Cirencester's History of Roman Britain, written
about 1338, the orthography is Carridden.  The word is under-
stood to be of Celtic or ancient British derivation, and to denote
the relative position of the then existing village as a military sta-
tion, or the specific character of its locality.  Chalmers, in his
Caledonia, represents it as being the same with Caer Adin or
Eden, which, in the British language of Roman times, signifies fort
on the wing, or projection like a wing.
   Extent, &c.-According to Forrest's survey of the county, fur-
nished in 1817, the length of the parish from east to west is 3 sta-
tute miles, And nearly 2 furlongs; and the breadth from north to
south wants half a furlong of 2 miles; the number of square miles
which it contains being 424.  It is bounded on the east, by the
parish of Abercorn; on the west, by the parish of Borrowstounness;
on the north, by the Forth; and on the south, by the parish of
Linlithgow; presenting the appearance of an irregular four-sided
figure, the longest side stretching along the shores of the Forth.
