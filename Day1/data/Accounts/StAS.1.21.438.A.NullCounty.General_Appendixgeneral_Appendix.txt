<TABLE=Present state of the population, according to an account

   The real rent is supposed to be from 4000 l. to 5000 l.
sterling per ann.
   The stipend was lately augmented 10 chald. 2 firl. 2 pecks,
1 lip. of bear; 260 l. Scots money, stipend, and 100 l. Scots
for communion elements.  The glebe consists of 5 acres,
with grass for two cows and a horse, designed this year, after
a process before the Court of Session:  Glebe and foggage
worth about 20 l. per annum.  At present the whole is let
out; the minister having neither barn nor barn-yard to ena-
ble him to farm himself.
   The poor's funds are pretty nearly the same as in the for-
mer return; only the session has at present no money at in-
terest; having laid out what it had in erecting seats in the
church, which are let out at from 6 d. to 1 s. per seat room.
The collections at the kirk door amount to about 10 s. per
week.  Including the collection at the sacrament, and for
cloathing the poor, the amount may be from 36 l. to 40 l.
per annum.
