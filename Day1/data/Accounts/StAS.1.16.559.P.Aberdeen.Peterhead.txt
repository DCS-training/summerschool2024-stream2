on the coast.  There is great variety of pebbles to be found
on the sea-shore, very beautiful for shape, colour, and polish,
and some of them of considerable value.

   Pest Ground.-In the end of last century the plague was
in the town of Peterhead.  The persons infected with this
disease were removed out of the town; temporary huts of
timber were erected for their accommodation to the north-
ward, betwixt the town and blockhouse, on a piece of waste
ground, where the cattle of the feuers were pastured; the
people who died there were buried on the spot, and the
houses turned down and covered with earth; it was after-
wards called the pest-ground, and was never ploughed or
touched, till about 20 years ago, when this common was
disponed as property to the feuers of Peterhead; it was
then trenched, and several pieces of timber were found not
consumed; some timorous people were under apprehensions
that bad effects might have ensued from breaking up this
ground.

   Pits.-On the remotest extremity of this parish, on the
south side of the Sadle-hill of Invernettie, opposite to the
Den of Boddom, (which lies betwixt the Sadle and Stir-
ling-hill), there are a number of pits cast up along the
brae, without any order, of such a size as to contain 3 or
4 persons.  By tradition they are the Paights or Picts
houses, and the people in the neighbourhood believe the
Picts, who they imagine were of a diminutive size, dwelt
there; but this appears incredible; and it is more probable,
that in the time of incursions by the Danes, of which there
are certain accounts in the neighbouring parish of Cruden,
some of them had entrenched themselves there for a short
time, in order to be concealed, for which the place is ex-
tremely proper, as to this day no dwelling-house is in sight
