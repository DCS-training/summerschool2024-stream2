           Language, &c. of the People.-A mixture of the Scotch and
	English language is spoken by the original inhabitants of this pa-
	rish, and Gaelic and English by the moss population who settled
	here from the commencement of the moss improvement.  The
	Gaelic language has fallen so much into disuse during that time
	that few or none can profit by a sermon from the pulpit in that
	language.
	   The habits, dress, and food of the parishioners are similar to
	those of the agricultural population of Scotland in general.  It
	may be observed, however, that there has been a marked improve-
	ment generally since the last Statistical Account, in their habits of
	cleanliness, style of dress, and mode of living, arising from their
	being more independent in their circumstances.  They are a so-
	ber, industrious, contented, enterprising, and successful people,
	and generally unexceptionable in their moral and religious cha-
	racter.

	   Although the able-bodied portion of the population are em-
	ployed in field labour, yet such as are confined to their houses,
	during the winter season, are employed in thrashing grain, feed-
