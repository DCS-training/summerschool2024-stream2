   Births, Deaths, and Marriages.-There is no exact register
of the births and deaths in this parish.  This is partly owing
to the negligence of some, and to the unwillingness of others,
to pay the tax and trifling dues on births, to which the ses-
sion-clerk is legally entitled, for his trouble in filling up the
register.  According to the most probable account, the buri-
als in the parish church amount annually to about 30.  But
some families bury in the chapel ground at Kilbryde, and
others in the chapel ground at Ardoch; so that no certain
conclusion can be formed from this article.  The number of
births is supposed to exceed 70 per annum.  The number of
marriages, at an average, for 6 years past, amounts to 23;
but there are some irregular marriages in this parish and
neighbourhood.

   Rivers.-The river Allan, which runs through this parish,
takes its rise at Gleneagles, in the parish of Blackford, about
the distance of 11 miles from Dunblane.  It abounds with
burn trouts, and in some places with pike.  Some salmon,
gilses, and sea trout, are got in summer floods. Its course is
rapid for several miles.  Afterwards it flows in beautiful
curves through wide and fertile haughs.  And, in the last
part of its course, it is rapid, its banks steep, and mostly co-
vered with wood, and falls into the Forth, after it leaves this
parish, a little above Stirling Bridge.-The river Ardoch,
which takes its rife at Lochmahaick, in the parish of Kilma-
dock, likewise runs through the west part of this parish.  It
abounds with burn trout.

   Rent.-The valued rent of the parish is 7578 L 6 s. 8 d.
