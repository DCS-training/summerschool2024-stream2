expected at the same time, and a battery, now called the
Trench, was raised for his reception, at the mouth of the har-
bour.  About the same time Kintyre was visited by the plague,
which then raged over a great part of Britain.  By there ea-
lamities, the number of inhabitants was greatly reduced: And
although the loss was, in some measure, made up by a colony of
Lowlanders, introduced by the Earl of Argyll, yet it is probable
that the country did not, till very lately, recover its former
extent of population.  The returns made to Dr Webster, in
1755*, state the number of souls in this parish, to have been

*The inhabitants of the town are so apt to fluctuate, that it
it is not easy to ascertain their numbers with precision They
are computed at 5000.  In spring 1791, the exact number of
souls in the landward part of the parish (the villages of Dalin-
tober, Dalruadhain, and Lochend, being classed with the town)
was as follows:

In the same year 400 tickets for admission to the communion
were distributed to the Highlanders in the town, and 500 to the
Highlanders in the country.  By this proportion, the number
in the town should be 4644.  But as the proportion of Low-
landers in the town is much greater than in the country, and
the proportion of communicants fewer, owing to so many of the
men being absent, it is believed that 5000, computed to be in
the town and adjoining villages, is very near the truth.  The
average of baptisms in the parish, for nine years past, is 254 1/3
per annum, and of marriages 42: But from this no other infe-
rence can be drawn, but that, right or wrong, we increase and
multiply.  The average given will afford no exact rule of cal-
culation, as sailors, who make a considerable part of the inhabi-
tants of the town, are of a migratory nature, and the ministers
