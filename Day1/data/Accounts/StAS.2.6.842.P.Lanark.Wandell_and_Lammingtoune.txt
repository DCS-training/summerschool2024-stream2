<TABLE>

In this the allowance for communion elements is included.  In
the year 1824, I applied for an augmentation, when the Court mo-
dified 15 chalders, one-half meal, and the other half barley. This
was met on the part of the heritors by saying that all their teinds

decision of the Court.  The minister has a right to peat, fuel,
turf, and divot, both in Lammingtoune and Wandell, and which I
exercise as often as I have occasion for all or either of them.

50 for the school of Wandell, and 150 for the scbool of Lamming-
toune, appointed to be att the church."  Mr John Tweedie, father
of the present respectable parochial teacher of Pettinain, was the
last schoolmaster of Wandell.  He died after the commencement
of the present century, when, owing to the smallness of the salary,
and the great decrease in the population of that district, no male
teacher could be had to accept of the situation, and accordingly it
was conferred upon a female, Janet Telfer, who continued to teach
