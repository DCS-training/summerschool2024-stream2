more than a vestige.  Many farms are named which do not
now exist; and the adjoining farms have not received a pro-
portional increase.  The foundations of buildings are fre-
quently found where there is not now a house.  Indeed it
would not be surprising that population should flourish in the
immediate vicinity of a powerful family, so able, in turbulent
times, to protect its retainers, and disposed to encourage set-
tlers, by the appointment of village fairs, markets, and other-
wise.  The parish would seem to have lost, in point of popu-
lation, from the Revolution till within the space of 20 or 30
years ago, when the numbers have probably increased.
