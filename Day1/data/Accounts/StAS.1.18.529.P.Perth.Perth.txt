     of Perth.

   The Parliament house at Perth still remains, and is con-
verted, as well as it possibly could, into dwelling houses.
There remain also the ancient houses of many of the nobility;
which are now, in a manner, also modernised; such as the
houses of the Bishop of Dunkeld, Earl of Errol, and Earl of
Athole.  The Earl of Gowrie's house, which was originally
built by the Countess of Huntly, about the year 15720, remains:
but is not likely to remain much longer.  In the year 1746, it
was given by the magistrates to William Duke of Cumberland,
who sold it to government for the purpose of containing bar-
racks for a company of artillery.  It is now, I am told, to be
immediately taken down; and new barracks are to be erected
fit to contain not only a company of artillery, but also a full
regiment of foot.
   The citadel, which Oliver Cromwell built in the south
Inch, was demolished after the Restoration.  Very soon there
will not remain the smallest vestige of the entrenchments.
   The last of the large towers upon the town wall, called the
Spey tower, was taken down about 30 years ago.  There is
yet a small round tower on a remaining part of the wall,
which is called the Monk's tower, and where probably the
Monks who had been disorderly, were sometimes confined, in
order to do pennance.  In the last century, the Earl of Kin-
noul who was chancellor of Scotland, and possessed Gowrie's
house and garden, built the uppermost room of this tower, to
be a summer house.
   The revenue of the town is considerable, and well manag-
ed.  The people are ambitious of securing their money in the
funds of the public revenue, which may sometimes tempt the
managers to contract more debt in the execution of their
schemes, than they might otherwise do.  Nearly about
half of the members of the town council are deputed by the
trades.
