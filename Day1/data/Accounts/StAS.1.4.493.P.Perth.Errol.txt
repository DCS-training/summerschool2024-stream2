venience of which the people can complain, is the want of
good water.  There are few springs in the low grounds,
and the small streams which issue from the hills are pol-
luted before they reach the inhabitants of the carse.  The
country people use the water of the pows, which, in time
of drought, is of a stagnating nature, and in rain, is
deeply tinctured by the clay.  The inhabitants of the vil-
lage dig pit-wells, which, when left open, afford the most
nauseous water; and even when inclosed, and built up
with a pump, their produce is not of the most pleasant of
salutary quality.  But this is a disadvantage which it would
be very difficult to remove, and which the people must
endeavour to support as part of their natural destination.
