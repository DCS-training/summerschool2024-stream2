or more in breadth.  In this field there are eleven strata or
seams of workable coal, which usually dip (decline downward)
one fathom in fives towards the south, or the sea, but in a
circular direction, from the south-west to the south-east;
and they all rise towards the land in the opposite direction.
The first or uppermost of there reams crops out* nearest the
sea, and the rest follow it towards the land, at regular distan-
ces; all the different seams being perfectly parallel to one
another.  The distance, or respective deepness, with the
thickness of the several seams, will best appear from the an-
nexed sketch.

   The sketch exhibits a small section of the eleven seams,
they would appear to the eye if they were visible, with some-
what of their proportional distances.  They yield coal of
different qualities, all good and quick burning, except the
last, the raise coal, which is duller than the rest, and chiefly
used in making salt and lime; but it has also been exported.
The present dip-engine pit is cradled on the pavement of
The first seam.  The figures on the left side, mark the dis-
tances of the respective seams from one another in fathoms,
and consequently, their perpendicular depth, at that place,
from the surface of the ground.  The figures on the right
hand mark the thickness, from the roof to the pavement,
of the several seams, in feet and inches.  From there things
it appears, that from the pavement of the first seam to that
of the eleventh, is 104 fathoms; consequently, if the engine-
pit were removed so far to the dip as to take hold of first
seam, or Bow-bridge coal, at a depth of 20 fathoms, it would
take hold of the whole 11 seams at the depth of 124
fathoms, which is laid to be less than the depth from
which coals are railed at Newcastle and Whitehaven; and
