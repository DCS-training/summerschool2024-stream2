   State of the Poor.-There are no begging poor in the pa-
rish; but there are commonly about 12 pensioners on the
roll of the kirk session, to whom every allowance is made for
rendering them comfortable, that would not operate to the
discouragement of industry.  Besides the interest of 60 L.
Sterling, and the collections at the church, etc. a small paro-
chial assessment is made for their better support; one half of
which is paid by the heritors, and the other by the farmers,
etc. the mode of the assessment being regulated by an act and
recommendation of the county, founded upon the different
acts of Parliament relative to the poor.  It is pleasant to re-
mark, that the kirk-session never find cause to reject any ap-
plication for charity, none being ever made without real ne-
cessity:-Long may the lower classes of people in Scotland be
distinguished by that laudable pride of independence, which
makes them struggle, to the last, to maintain themselves on
the fruit of their labour, rather than depend, unnecessarily,
on the charity of others!
