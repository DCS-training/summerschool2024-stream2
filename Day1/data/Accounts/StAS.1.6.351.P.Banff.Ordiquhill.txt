   Among the many improvements that might be introduced into this part of
the country, a bridge, on the great road between Huntly and Portsoy, over the
Boyn, which partly runs through the parish, is much needed.  For want of
such an accommodation, several useful members of society have lost their lives;
and a woman, in attempting to, cross it, was with her horse burried down the
stream, where they perished.
