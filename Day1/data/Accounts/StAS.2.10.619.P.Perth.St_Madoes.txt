some fifty or sixty years ago, there were many of various sizes scat-
tered over the surface, or slightly penetrating the soil in the higher
part of the parish. In the progress of cultivation they have been
removed, and are now to be seen about the foundations of farm-
offices, &c. They were invariably of the primitive rocks, most
generally of granite, gneiss, and primitive greenstone. This is a
striking fact when viewed in connection with another fact already
stated, viz. that in that species of alluvium, which consists of a
clayey earth, mingled with, debris of the old red sandstone, there
are also considerable fragments of the trap-rocks; for it seems to
intimate that, subsequent to that watery agency which had depo-
sited the alluvium, or as geologists would perhaps term it, the di-
luvium mentioned, there had been some tremendous torrent which
had rolled the superincumbent boulders from the primitive mountains
in the west, the nearest of which is upwards of twenty miles distant.
