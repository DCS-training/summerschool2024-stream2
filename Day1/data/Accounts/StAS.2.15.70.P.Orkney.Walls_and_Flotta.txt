			UNITED PARISHES OF

			WALLS AND FLOTTA.

		PRESBYTERY OF CAIRSTON, SYNOD OF ORKNEY.

	       I.-TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL HISTORY.
   Name, &c.-THESE parishes consist of three, or more properly
speaking, of four inhabited islands. Walls comprehends the
greater part of the island of Hoy, which, in the group of the Ork-
neys, is considered to rank next to Pomona, or the Mainland, in
point of extent. It is probable that Walls derives its name from
"Voes," which signifies a bay or inlet of the sea. It was ancient-
ly called "Valis," "Waes," or "Waas." The last mentioned
is still retained in pronunciation, although Walls is the name by
which it is designated in all written documents.
   Extent and Boundaries.-The parish is about 7 1/2 miles in length
from north to south, and about 6 miles in breadth from east to
west. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Hoy; on the
east, by Scalpa Flow; and on the south and west, by the Pentland
Frith. The parish is nearly divided into two portions by the bay
of Longhope, which extends about five miles from east to west.
At one part, on the south side of the bay, the waters of Longhope
almost meet those of the Pentland Frith, which at that place
extend through a bay, and are only separated by a very narrow
strip of land, generally not exceeding 200 feet, even at low water,
while at spring tides it is for several days overflowed at high water,
so as often to be impassable except by a boat. Hence Walls is
sometimes spoken of as a separate island from Hoy; and certain-
ly, so far as regards the convenience of the inhabitants, the facili-
ties of communication are not greater than if they formed two dis-
tinct islands. This narrow strip of land, which is covered with
stones, and constantly exposed to the waves of the Pentland Frith,
seems to retain the same form which it did nearly three centuries
ago, as Buchanan, in his History of Scotland, describes these islands
