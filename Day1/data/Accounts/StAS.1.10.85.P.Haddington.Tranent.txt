     of Tranent.

   Agriculture in this parish is, in general, in the same
flourishing state that characterises East Lothian at large.
The great proportion of acres possessed by people who take
land from necessity and convenience, makes the proper ma-
nagement of it but a secondary object.

   To give an idea of the quantity of each species of crop at an
average, a statement of the different sowings for 1791, and
the supposed produce, is annexed.

   No value is put upon 423 acres of pasture.  The quantity of
turnips raised here is trifling, and no lint is sown but for
private use.  If for these articles, a sum, not exceeding 400 L.
is added to the preceding table, the total amount, 13,300 L.
will be nearly the annual produce of the parish.  The late
invention of threshing-mills seems to have met with the ap-
probation of the farmers, there being already 4 of them in
the parish.
