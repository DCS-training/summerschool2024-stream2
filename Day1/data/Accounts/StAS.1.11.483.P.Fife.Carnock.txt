there being at least 5 different coal mines in it, belonging to
as many different proprietors; viz.  Sir John Halket of Pit-
sirran-the Rev. Dr. John Erskine of Carnock-Mr. Mill of
Blair-Mr. Mutter of Annfield-and Mr. Hogg of New Lif-
ton.  There is also some iron-stone on the estates of these
gentlemen.  The produce of the mines is uncertain.  Mr.
Mutter's coallets at 100 L. a-year, and Dr. Erskine's at 40 L. Mr.
Mill's, which is wrought for his own emolument, is supposed
to produce from 80 L. to 100 L. per annum.  The stone quar-
ries on the N. part of Dr. Erskine's estate are of great ex-
tent, and easily wrought without any tiring.  They are si-
tuated within 3 miles of the port of Torry, and 5 of Lime-
kilns, where they can be conveniently shipped for exporta-
tion.  They consist of 3 different kinds of stone, one of a
bluish black colour, with a fine greek, capable of receiving a
polish like marble.  This stone will stand the fire, and the
longer it is exposed, it becomes the more durable, and con-
tracts the blacker hue.  The second is a white stone, of a fine
small greek, soft when first raised from the quarry, but gra-
dually hardening afterwards.  Though, to appearance, not
very durable, it withstands the ravages of rain and tempest.
Stones of both these species have been dug up, 24 feet long
and 5 or 6 broad; and, it is not doubted, they might be rais-
ed of far greater dimensions.  The third is of a brownish co-
lour and a harder quality than the second, well calculated for
building houses, etc.  Some of this kind have been raised 7
or 8 feet long.  They take a fine polish.  Double the quan-
tity of stones can be quarried here, in the same space of time,
that can be done in any of the other quarries in the country.

the parish, chiefly of the chalybeate kind, but they are little
