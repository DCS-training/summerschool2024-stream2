of the county, and there are no less than 28 procurators before
the Sheriff-courts, who reside and carry on a respectable busi-
ness, and hold a respectable rank in the town. Since the last Ac-
count, the number of these procurators has increased from 12
to 28. Allowing to each of them 2 apprentices or clerks, there
are no less than 84, all busied in directing the course of justice.
Since the time of the last Account, a Sheriff-court has been esta-
blished at Dunfermline for the western district.
   The principal change that has taken place in the town since
the last account is the removal of the jail, and the town and
county halls, so as to open up the streets and improve the thorough-
fares. The consequence is, that Cupar wears now the appear-
ance of a clean and comfortable English town. Being lighted
up with gas, during the night it has a very attractive appearance.
Its dimensions have been much extended by the suburbs called the
Brae-heads, New Town, and Lebanon.
   The principal change that has taken place in the parish is the
improvement of the cross roads, which are now, with few exceptions,
kept like turnpikes. The villages of Springfield and Glaidney
have also been much extended since last Account, and are still in-
creasing. There have been three handsome stone bridges thrown
over the Eden to increase the communication betwixt the north and
south sides. And should the railway that is now talked of be car-
ried through, it seems impossible to conceive the advantages that
would accrue to the town of Cupar and the neighbourhood. The
people are much the same in character as they were forty years ago,
-greatly influenced by politics, and very excitable, but upon the
whole far more temperate and reasonable than in many other places.
