the lower class as they advance in life.  A house for the
accommodation of this useful order of men is, for the most
part, constructed of stone and feal, is reared on a sudden,
and the occupant inhabits it as soon as constructed.  Ill se-
cured from the effects of the weather, and scantily provided
with fuel, which is both dear and scarce, the seeds of this
disease are rooted into the constitution, which the vigour of
youth may for a while brave; but, as old age advances, sel-
dom fail to manifest themselves in great virulence, and im-
pair the strength of manhood by immature old age.  Inno-
culation for the small-pox gains ground, from experience of
its usefulness, though contrary to the theory of religious
prejudice.

   Fish, etc.-Associations have been formed to preserve
the salmon in Tweed during close-time, which can produce
no good, so long as salmon are not permitted to come up
beyond a certain length before this season commences.  The
interest of no class of men here is concerned in their pre-
servation.  To make it so, the proprietors below must yield
up a few of their good fish, to give the people above them
an experimental proof of the difference betwixt good and
bad salmon.  The want of this makes them unable to di-
stinguish the good from the bad; and all is fish that comes
in the net.  The first streams in Tweed in which the sal-
mon deposit their spawn are within a few miles of the
bounds of this parish.  The people here can judge, by the
appearance of the fish, whether it will deposit its spawn in
Tweed or its feeders.  Tweed formerly produced a great,
quantity of salmon; now they are seldom to be caught, ex-
cept after close-time.  Trout are to be met with in great
quantity both in Tweed and Leithen.  Pike are found in
the old run of the Leithen.  Birds are of the same kinds
all over the county.  Quadrupeds the same also.
