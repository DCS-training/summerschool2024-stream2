on to such an extent, that the value of goods manufactured,
during the curr ny of the year 1792, amounted to the sum
of 76-6 l. Sterling
   In the spring of the year 1790, the public spirited exer-
tions of Mr Dunmore having been already directed to this
corner, he applied himself, with success, to procure the erec-
tion of a cotton mill in the neighbourhood of his new vil-
lage; and a happy situation having been chosen on the banks
of the water of Endrick, the work was carried on, through
his means, with such astonishing dispatch, that, in the month
of June of the same year, yarn was spun in it.  This branch
of manufacture, in December 1792, gave employment to
390 people.  Of these, 120 were men; 90 women; 180
children, from 6 to 16 years of age.
   The cotton mill, thus erected, fully answered the purpose
of extending and improving the village.  Mr Dunmore readi-
ly feued out grounds to the new settlers, for the site of a
house and gardens most commonly to the extent of a quarter
of an acre, and, at first, upon such easy terms as to afford
them ample encouragement; but here, as in many other
cases, well directed liberality proved good policy; for the
consequent prosperity of his village, and its manufactures,
soon enabled him to raise the rate of his feu-duty from 2 l.
to 4 l. per acre, without retarding the progress of building,
or at all distressing the people.  The houses, in general, are
substantial.  Most of them are covered with slate; and some
of them are three stories high.  The village now consists of
105 new houses, in which there are upwards of 430 rooms
with fire places.
   For the rapid rise, and increase of the population of this
new village, we are partly indebted to a printfield and bleach-
field, which Mr Dunmore, with the same patriotic views,
procured to be established upon the opposite banks of the
