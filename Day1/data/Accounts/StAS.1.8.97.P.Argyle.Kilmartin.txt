*There is no register of deaths.  There are few above 83 in the parish, and none so
old as 90.

   +The proportion of bachelors to the annual marriages is about 6 to 1:  Of
the latter to the whole population, as 1 to 19; and of the births, as 1 to 50.

arable land, marked out for himself, which may be, from 1, to 2, or 3 acres,
though not generally measured, with grass for 1 or 2 cows, in common with the
cattle of the next farm.  It were to be wished that this mode would become more

greater number.

   ^^The cotters are the most numerous class, in which are comprehended the
tradesmen, the day labourers, the old infirm reduced tenants, and several widows.
The cotter possesses only a small house and garden, sometimes without a cow's
grass, and even potatoe land, but what he must purchase from the tenants, He
