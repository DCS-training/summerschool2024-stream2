     COUNTY OF ROSS, SYNOD OF GLENELG, ISLAND AND
     PRESBYTERY OF LEWIS).

     By the Rev. Mr Alexander Simson.

     Name, Situation, etc.

   This parish derives its name from the numerous har-
bous which are in it, and which are always in this
country called Lochs.  They are so well secured from the
sea, that many of them are very well adapted for places of
anchorage to vessels of considerable burden, and the whole
of them for small vessels, and are excellent landing-places
for open boats.  The parish may also derive its name in
part from the innumerable bodies (lochs) of fresh water,
situated in the moor, all of which abound with small
trout of excellent quality.  It is situated in the country of
Ross, within the bounds of the presbytery of Lewis, and
