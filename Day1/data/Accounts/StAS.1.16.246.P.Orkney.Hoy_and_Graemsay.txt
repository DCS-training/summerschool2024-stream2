the Atlantic Ocean to the westward.  The parish from
N. W. to S. E. is about 9 or 10 miles long, and in gene-
ral is about 6 miles broad.  It may be called a very hilly
or mountainous district.  One of these hills in particu-
lar being so steep in many places of it, is almost inaccessible
on account of rocks of an uncommon size.  Some strangers
with their mathematical instruments have computed the
height of it, from the water's edge to the top, an English
mile.  There is neither pasture nor heath grows upon it,
and it only serves as a fine mark for mariners or seafaring
people to bring them into a safe harbour.

   Soil and Climate.-The land or arable ground in this
place is generally wet and spongy; the soil light, and bet-
ter calculated for grass than for grain.  The air is healthy,
and the people generally long-lived; one person, in parti-
cular, who had resided in the parish from his youth, died
some years ago at the advanced age of 100.

   Sheep.-The principal circumstance for which this parish
is remarkable is their sheep, if they were properly taken care
of as in other countries to the southward; but no arguments
will prevail with the country people of the parish to take
better care of them, except their landlords would interpose
their authority, which they will not.  The sheep all run
wild in these mountains, and are never got until they run
them down with their dogs, and by that means they are
much abused.  Some of these sheep will run with three or
four years wool upon them, and when hounded by their
dogs, they run generally to the rocks, where there is no
possibility of access to them.  Many of their young lambs
are devoured, and picked up by eagles and other birds of
prey, which are very numerous in this place; and in the
winter-season, when the sheep come down to the sea-side
