fures, all within a mile or half a mile of the mansion-house,
five or fix, lime quarries, some of them nine feet thick, and very
near the surface, and not interrupted by water.  The whole
ground round the mansion house is ful of coal: two seam,
one a little below the other, have been worked to great ad-
vantage.  (especially of late, as the demand has increased by
