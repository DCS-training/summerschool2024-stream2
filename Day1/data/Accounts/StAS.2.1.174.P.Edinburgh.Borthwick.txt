apt, unless well treated, to fall back speedily into its natural
state-but much, as might be expected, has been done to aug-
ment its capabilities-and the progress of improvement is still car-
ried on with spirit.
   The original domain, which lies contiguous to the house, is re-
markable for many old and venerable trees,and may easily be dis-
tinguished by the aspect of its wood from the neighbouring pro-
perties which have been successively added to it-and which now
form with it one continuous domain.
   The banks of the South Esk, within this domain, are of distin-
guished beauty and most picturesque effect. The banks of the North
Esk, indeed, are more generally known, being more in the vicini-
ty of the metropolis, and on a greater scale;-and though there is
certainly nothing in the course of the more southern stream that
can vie with Roslin-or Hawthornden-or even with the scenery
in the neighbourhood of Lasswade and Springfield, yet there is
much which is fitted to awaken the liveliest emotions of delight,
and which might, with much effect, employ the skill of the profes-
sional draftsman, or of the amateur copyist of natural scenery.
Immediately around the mansion-house, and along the banks of
the small stream which flows behind it, are several trees of rare
occurrence, of majestic size, and with which a zealous botan-
ist would be delighted to become acquainted.  The successive
proprietors of this domain have always been zealous improvers of
their property by planting-and the late Chief Baron kept a small
manuscript volume, in which he occasionally inserted such notices,
as he could obtain, of the operations, in this line, of those who had
preceded him-and of what had been done by himself for extend-
ing these operations.
  Shank Point, which belongs to this property, has been celebrat-
ed by Graham in the subjoined lines, which may be considered as
at once a correct topographical description of the locality-and a
rich poetical picture of the scenery which surrounds it.

                "What though fair Scotland's vallies rarely vaunt,
		The oak majestical, whose aged boughs
		Darken a rood breadth! yet nowhere is seen
		More beauteously profuse, wild underwood;
		Nowhere 'tis seen more beauteously profuse,
		Than on thy tangling banks, well-wooded Esk,
		And Borthwick, thine, above that fairy nook
		Formed by your blending streams.-The hawthorn there,
		With moss and lichen grey, dies of old age,
		No steel profane permitted to intrude:
		Vp to the topmost branches climbs the rose,
		And mingles with the fading flowers of May;
