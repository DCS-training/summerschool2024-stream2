from the west end of the parish, and three miles from the east
end. Formerly the greatest part of the people lived in the west
part of the parish: but as the most of the land there is in pas-
ture, and many houses have been built on the great north road,
the east quarter is now the most populous. The former church,
which was built in 1775, was unfortunately burnt on 11th of March
1832, owing  to the pipe of the stove being too near the top of the
wall, and setting fire to the wall-plates. It was rebuilt immediately,
and is now one of the handsomest, though unfortunately not one
of the most substantial, churches in the country. The expense
was about L. 850. It can accommodate upwards of 400 persons.
All of the seats are free.
   The manse was built in 1744, and thoroughly repaired, and
the offices rebuilt in 1793. * The grebe consists of 5 acres of
arable, and nearly 2 of foggage or pasture-ground. The latter
was formed into a watered meadow, and yields 5 tons of hay
annually. The foggage being under the legal quantity, 16s.
8d. was added to the stipend to make up the deficiency. The
value of the glebe is about L. 14 per annum. The stipend,
including L. 4, 3s. 4d. for element-money, and 16s. 8d. for the
above-mentioned deficiency of foggage, consists of L. 49, 8s.
10 8/12d. in money; 24 bolls of oatmeal, and 8 bolls of bear, amount-
ing, at an average of seven years, to L. 32, 3s. 11d.: the Go-
vernment allowance being L. 82, 6s. 1 10/12d.; the glebe being va-
lued at L. 14; and the manse (before the additions mentioned in
the foot-note were made) at L. 8: altogether L. 185, 18s. 11 6/12d.
   The number of persons, with their families, who belong to the
Established Church is about 620; of Seceders, 60. Divine ser-
vice is generally well attended at the Established Church. The
number of communicants is about 200. The patron of the parish
is John Young, Esq. of Cleish.
   Education.-There are three schools in the parish: the paro-
chialsebool, situated nearthe church; a private school at Maryburgh,
in the most populous part of the parish; and occasionally another
private school at Gairney Bridge, which is convenient for the
children in the neighbourhood, and also for some in the adjacent
parishes.  The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommoda-
tion; his-salary is the maximum. The school fees, in 1834,

<FOOTNOTE>Since this was written, a large and handsome addition has been made to the
manse, and an entirely new set of offices, besides a garden wall, have been built.
The whole cost nearly L. 1000.
