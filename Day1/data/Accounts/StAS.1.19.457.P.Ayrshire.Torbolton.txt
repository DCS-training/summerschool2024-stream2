   Collections for the Poor.-The average Sunday collec-
tions for the poor are from 12s. to 15s. in amount.  At
the dispensation of the Sacrament, and upon other extraor-

   Antiquities.-Tarbolton was most probably a station of
the Danes, at the remote period of our ancient history,
when these people possessed all the northern and western
isles adjacent to Scotland, and even considerable posts and
possessions upon the shores of the mainland.  Closely con-

was perhaps the boundary between the Danes and the Gael.

Black Monks of Clugni.  I know not whether it may not
rather be the same with that priory of Failefurd, to which
