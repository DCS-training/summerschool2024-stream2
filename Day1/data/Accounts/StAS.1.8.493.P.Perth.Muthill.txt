observation.  The camp at Strageath is situated on the banks
of the Ern, near Innerpefray.  Its dimensions cannot now be
ascertained with any degree of exactness; the lines and ditches
being completely levelled, except in a few places.  But from
what remains, it seems not to have been strongly fortified.
From its size, too, it appears to have been only a temporary
station for a small army.

   The camp at Ardoch, as being the most complete of any in
Scotland, or perhaps in Great Britain, is entitled to a more
particular description.  Its situation gave it many advantages;
being on the N. W. side of a deep moss, that runs a long
way eastward.  On the west side, it is partly defended by the
steep banks of the water of Knaick; which bank rises per-
pendicularly between 40 and 50 feet.  The north and east
sides were most exposed; and there, we find, very particular
care was taken to secure them.  The ground on the east is
pretty regular, and descends by a gentle slope from the lines
of fortification, which, on that side, consist of five rows of
ditches, perfectly entire, and running parallel to one another.
These altogether are about 55 yards in breadth.  On the
north side there are an equal number of lines and ditches,
but 20 yards broader than the former.  On the west, besides
the steep precipices above mentioned, it was defended by at
least two ditches.  One is still visible; the others have proba-
bly been filled up, in making the great military road from
Stirling to the North.

   The side of the camp, lying to the southward, exhibits to
the antiquary a less pleasing prospect.  Here the peasant's
rugged hand has laid in ruins a great part of the lines;
so that it may be with propriety said, in the words of a La-
tin poet, "Fam Seges est, ubi Troja suit*." However, from
the remains yet to be traced, it appears there were also 3 or
