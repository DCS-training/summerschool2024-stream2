   There is one of a similar appearances, but much larger; it
is now generally thought to be natural.
   On the top of the Knock-hill is the vestige of a small
camp, with three regular entrenchments.  Above Hailley,
and directly opposite to the camp just mentioned, about the
distance of three miles, are the remains of an ancient fortifi-
cation, which is still called the Castle-hill.
   There are likewise several tumuli in the parish, generally
believed to have been raised after the battle of Largs, over
the bodies of the slain.  This battle was fought in the reign
