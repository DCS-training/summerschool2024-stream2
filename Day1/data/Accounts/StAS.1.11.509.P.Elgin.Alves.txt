a considerable proportion of their rents was paid to the Earl of
Moray in that grain.  This his Lordship has now converted

great an extent.  They are now making a rapid progress in
the modern style of agriculture.  Grass seeds are laid down
on a large scale.  Beans are planted in drills.  Many acres
of turnips are sown both in drills, and in the broad cast way,
with great success.  Potatoes are also raised in very consider-

and, when that is not the case, the following crop is pease,
and barley with grass seeds thereafter.  The oats, that grow
in Alves, are about a fortnight later in ripening than those
produced in the neighbourhood, and therefore are in request
for seed in the light and sandy grounds in this country, and,
on trial, are found to produce an excellent quality of grain,
and superior quantity of fodder.

They would animate the farmers to superior industry and pro-

ed.  It is with pleasure that the writer of this article can
add, that in this parish, upon Lord Moray's property, there
