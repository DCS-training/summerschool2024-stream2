they consider every spot they possess as of immediate use, and useful only
as it bears a crop, on feeds a cow.  Plans, therefore, or distant prospect,
and of future advantage, but which must be attended with present ex-
pense, are seldom thought of, and never adopted.  Under these circum-
stances, it is not to be wondered at, if the parish is, with respect to trees,
what it was in the days of their fathers, very naked and bare ; in-
deed, after what has been said, the reader will be surprised when he is
told, that in no parish of the same limits, and inhabited by so plain and
frugal a people, will he find a greater number of good substantial houses.
Many of these are stated, and finished in a style that shows what might be
done in other things, was there the same inducement.  Those above us in
rank or riches, may call forth our esteem or admiration ; but those in e-
qual station with ourselves call forth our emulation, and these
active principles by which we are urged from one thing to ano-
ther, and always farther than we would otherwise go, merely that
we may preserve our equality, and our wonted distinction from
those beneath us ; and when we attribute one part of their improvement
to this, it is natural to hope, that some time or other the same principle
will operate as powerfully towards their improvement in other respects ;
and that the nakedness of the land will no longer stare every stranger in
the face.
