proper for mills and bleachfields.  The principals disadvan-
tages are, the stubborn nature of a great part of the soil, and
the want of good roads.  The latter disadvantages, however,
will soon be in a great measure removed, two lines of turn-
pike road being now carrying through the parish, leading
from Glasgow, the one to Drymen, and the other to Bal-
fron.  If to these were added a good cross road from east to
west, there would remain little cause of complaint on this
account.  The difficulty of procuring dung in sufficient quan-
tity for the land, is also no small disadvantage.  The farmers
in the south part of the parish, indeed, carry it, but at a very
great expense, from Glasgow, Port. Glasgow, and Greenock;
but it will not bear the expence of carriage, added to its
price, from these places to the north part; so that the far-
mers there are confined to the quantity made on their farms,
which is commonly far from sufficient.
