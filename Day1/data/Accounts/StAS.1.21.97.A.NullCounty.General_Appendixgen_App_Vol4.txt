     The Statistical Account.

that curse of Scotland, that bane of improvement, by which many
gentlemen who have the inclination, are deprived of the
power of improving their estates, and doing good to their
country, I mean entails; were this the case, and could gen-
tlemen be persuaded to let their estates on more liberal
terms, we may venture to prognosticate, from the spirit which
at present animates our farmers, that our country would soon
put on a different appearance.  Those large tracts of barren
muirs, and bleak out-fields, which give it so gloomy an as-
pect, would soon be covered with crops of grain or pasture,
and would be made to contribute to enrich individuals, and
to the public good.
   I shall only add, that the badness of out roads in general,
and particularly to the port of Newburgh, from which we get
our lime, and which is the general market for our grain, has
hitherto been, and still is, a great obstruction to the improve-
ment of this country; but, as a turnpike road from Aberdeen
to Ellon is contracted for, and proposed to be carried on
through Buchan, and an act of Parliament for commuting
the statute labour is proposed, it is to be hoped that this
evil, which is indeed one of the first magnitude, will soon be
remedied.
