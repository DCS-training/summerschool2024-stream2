   Productions, etc.-The produce is barley, oats, pease, turnips,
potatoes and cabbages.  Lord Peterborough, nine years ago,
planted a large field near the house of Durris, with Scots
fir, larix, etc.  This plantation is thriving very well.  He
has lately inclosed a great deal of moor ground near the
house of Durris.  Part of these inclosures is already planted.
There is a very romantic den at the back of the house of
Durris, planted with ash, elm, horse-chesnut, beech, larix,
birch, and oak.  The number of cattle may be about 5 or
600, of horses 123, and of sheep 2275.

     Church.-The stipend of Durris is L. 50 Sterling.  No
victual is paid to the minister.  The Earl of Peterborough is
both patron and proprietor.  It brings him in L. 1200 Ster-
ling, per annum.  The manse, and most of the office-houses
are new.  They were built in the years 1773 and 1774.

   Poor.-The number of poor, receiving alms, is from 30 to
40 yearly.  The total sum of annual collections, and of an-
