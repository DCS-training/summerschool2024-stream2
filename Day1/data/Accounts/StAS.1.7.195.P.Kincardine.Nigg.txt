with two cairns, which are seen several leagues off, and direct
those who fail near the coast.  The north side of the parish
consists of two haughs, on the river and the side of a hill,
ending in the Girdleness, and of a valley and hill beneath
the heathy ridge.  Though a part of the soil be clayish, the
far greater part is loamy, of various depth, and on different
bottoms, in some places incumbered with stones.  The haughs,
the valley, and tides of the two hills, to the north, are ara-
ble.  The bank to the south is in good part ploughed.  A
broad belt, of above a mile, more and less, throughout the
middle, and the whole length of the parish, with the excep-
tion of some acres lately cultivated, is unarable and uninha-
bited, consisting of moss and of heath, strewed with many
stones.  The measures of the different kinds of ground*, are,
infield, 526 acres 2 roods 7 falls; outfield, 577 acres 2 roods
26 falls; pasture, 584 acres 5 falls; moor, 1483 acres 2 roods
1 fall; moss, 203 acres 3 roods 35 falls; total, 3375 acres
2 roods 34 falls.  The infield, or croft, is ground continually
in tillage, and regularly manured.-The outfield is ground
which is never manured, but ploughed occasionally from
pasture grass.

   Coast.-A mile from the south-west boundary.  There is
a natural harbour, with very little artificial help, the cove,
fit for boats, which accommodates the fishermen of a village
lying above it, and sometimes affords refuge to others:  For
northward of the port of Aberdeen, for several leagues, is a
sand beach, and that port being formed by a river, has often
a surge rising quickly at its mouth, by the wind blowing in
shore, dangerous to boats; here, therefore, they have often
