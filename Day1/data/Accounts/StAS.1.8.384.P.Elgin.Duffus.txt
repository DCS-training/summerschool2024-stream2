     NUMBER XXII*.

     PARISH OF DUFFUS.

     (County and Synod of Moray.-Presbytery of Elgin.)

     By a FRIEND to STATISTICAL INQUIRIES.

     Extent, Surface, Soil and Produce.

   DUFFUS extends 5 miles in length, from E. to W.
along the S. coast of the Moray Frith, and in breadth
from 2 to 3 miles S. and N.  It is one continued plain, ex-
cepting a rising ground, of no great height, near the middle of
the parish, which is every where arable.  Along the coast, all
the length of the parish, and more than half a mile of the
breadth of it, the surface is a meagre, green, benty pasture.
All this ground had formerly been a rich cultivated soil; but
for many years, has been overblown with dry sand, from the
western beach.  The sand has for some time ceased to blow, and
a great part of this space may again be brought into culture,
by the application of the spade or trench plough.  There have
already been some successful experiments of this kind, and in
many places, there is but little depth of sand upon the top.

<FOOTNOTE>

*N. B.  The PARISH of CRIECH, marked NUMBER XIX, should have been
NUMBER XXI; and all the preceding parishes, (from CARLUKE, which is erro-
neously stated as NUMBER VIII, instead of NUMBER IX,) are numbered one too
low.
