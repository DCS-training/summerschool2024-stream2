the stock of the poor's fund; but, owing to the few residing
heritors in the parish, and a degree of sanaticism among
some of the lower sort of people, which takes them to other
meetings than the Established Church, the collection at the
church door is less now than formerly, and it is to be feared
that an assessment may soon be necessary, which, wherever
it takes place, is attended with many pernicious conse-
quence*.

   Minerals.-In several parts of the parish, there are coal
and lime pits which have been wrought, and at present
there is one coal work going.  Freestone in great quanti-
ties is to be found in many places, some of it of an excel-

tain their poor, but also to employ surgeons and schoolmasters for the be-
nefit of the workmen and their families:-a line of conduct highly proper,
and meritorious, and well worthy the imitation of every master manu-
facturer.
