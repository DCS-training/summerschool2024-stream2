ly a garden in the parish that deserves the name; culinary
productions being more regarded than ornament or ele-
gance.  There are 2 rivulets and 5 mills; 1 in Coupar, 3 in
Kethock, and 1 in Balgirsho.

   Manufactures.-There is a tannery in Coupar, which was
built in 1781, wherein about 2600 hides of different kinds
are dressed annually, and 9000 stone of bark used.  There is
also a very considerable linen manufacture*.  In 1792, there
were stamped at the stamp-office in this town, all manufac-
tured in the course of that year, and within the bounds of
the parish, 97,810 yards of brown linen (in about 600 reed),
and 116,793 yards of harn.  Both these kinds are sent to
the English market.  The linen is whitened at the bleach-
fields in the neighbourhood, is used for buckram and hat
linings, and is worth about 9 d. per yard.  The harn is used
for pack-sheet, and is worth about 5 d. per yard.  There is
but one bleachfield in the parish, viz. that at Balgirsho, at
which there are annually whitened about 200,000 yards.  The
number last year (1793) was only 90,000 yards.  There are
4 whisky stills in the parish, 3 of 40 gallons, and 1 of 30.

   Population.-The population of this parish has increased
considerably within there 40 years, as will appear from the
following Table:

<FOOTNOTE>

*The introduction of the linen manufacture, into this parish
and neighbourhood, was principally owing to GEORGE YOUNG,
late a merchant in this town, a man of an uncommon capacity
for business and improvements.  This man found means, by
petitioning the Board of Trustees for the Forfeited Estates of
Scotland, to procure a survey, and estimate of expence, for a
CANAL between PERTH and FORFAR by this place.  The plan
was formed on a scale too expensive for the state of the country
at that time, and was consequently dropt.
