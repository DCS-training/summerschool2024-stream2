had been limed, were luxuriant, but more straw than
corn.  Some sowed it the last year that it was in tillage
with grass feeds, and the crop was good. But they
erred in allowing the cattle to pasture on it too soon.
The roots of the grass were broken, the best of the soil
trodden down, and almost the whole reduced to the same
state in which it was before.  There is one, however,
who is to be excepted, as not having followed the ge-
neral practice.  And if he who makes three blades of
grass grow where only was produced before, de-
serves well of his country, his name ought to be men-

farm in this parish, about 12 or 14 years ago.  It had
been managed in the ordinary way, part in grass, and
part in tillage.  But there were 6 or 7 acres to which
nothing had been done, and to which be wished to do
something.  His great object was fodder for his cattle
in winter.  He hired men to dig part of it with the
spade, and to form it into ridges; he afterward limed
it, and sowed it with oats.  He had more corn than he
expected, and the straw was plentiful.  This encouraged
him to go on; he dressed the first over again, and all
that remained in the same way, sowed it with oats and
grass seeds.  The crop was as good as could have been
expected; and, for the 2 last years, the day that was
produced would have sold for 20 1. Sterling.  Before he
did any thing to it, to use his own words, an acre would
not have grazed a sheep.  He thinks that it will never
be fit for the plough.  In this, he may be mistaken.  But
he never allows any of his cattle to pasture upon it, be-
ing sensible, that even for grass it would greatly hurt it,
both by breaking the roots, and the sward, as it is call-
