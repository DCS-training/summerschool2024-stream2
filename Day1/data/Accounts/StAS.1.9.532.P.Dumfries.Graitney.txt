scene of drunkenness.  His irregular conduct has rendered him an object
of detestation to all the sober and virtuous part of the neighbourhood.
Such is the man (and the description is not exaggerated) who has had
the honour to join, in the sacred bonds of wedlock, many people of great
rank and fortune from all parts of England.  It is 40 years and upwards
since marriages of this kind began to be celebrated here.  At the lowest
computation about 60 are supposed to be solemnized annually in this
place.  Taken at an average through the year, they may be estimated at
15 guineas each; consequently this traffic brings in about L. 945 a year.
The form of ceremony, when any ceremony is used, is that of the Church
of England.  On some occasions, particularly when the parson is intoxi-
cated, which is often the case, a certificate only is given.  The certificate
is signed by the parson himself, and two witnesses under fictitious signa-
tures.  The following is a
     Copy of one of these Certificates, in the original Spelling:
   "This is to sartsay all persons that my be consernid, that A B from
the parish of C. and in county of D. and E F. from the parish of G. and
in the county of H. and both comes before me and declayred themselves
both to be single persons, and now married by the forme of the Kuk of
Scotland, and agreible to the Church of England, and givine ondie my
hand, this 18th day of March, 1793"

   Is it not a disgrace to the police of a civilized country, to permit such
irregularities to be practised with impunity?  And is it not a reflection
on the good sense and discernment of the Nobility and Gentry of Eng-
land, (for some of the English Nobility have been married here), to suffer
themselves to be imposed upon, and their pockets to be picked, by such
miscreants?
