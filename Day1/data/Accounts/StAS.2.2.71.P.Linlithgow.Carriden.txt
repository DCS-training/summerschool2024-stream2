day. The small coat is quite unsaleable; the greater part of it is,
of course, left in the waste, and, were it not for the use of the salt-
pans, none of it would be brought up at all. The pit is about a
mile from the shore, the coals being conveyed to the place of ship-
ment by a railway. The coal dips generally to the west at the
rate of 1 in 7 or 8 feet. Before the present dip workings com-
menced, which was in, 1830, the workings were above the level
of the pit-bottom reaching to the south of the pit about 900 yards,
where the coal gets below the Irongath hills, in a direction nearly
straight south, dipping to the north in some places at the rate of
1 in 3. But it became so mixed with stone and troubled with
dikes, which were generally up to the south, that the working of
it was discontinued. The quality of this seam of coal is highly
esteemed.
   In 1833, the Burn pit was sunk from the main to the smithy
coal, a seam lying 12 fathoms deeper, and about 2 feet 7 inches
thick.
   Fishery.-A stake-net for taking salmon was erected several
years ago in the Frith, on the property of Captain Hope of Car-
riden, having three pockets or chambers; and the fishing has occa-
sionally been pretty successful.
   Produce.-The following is given as an approximation to, the
gross amount of produce:

   Manufactures.-There were six salt-pans working in the village
of Grange-pans in 1834, which made about 23,000 bushels of salt
annually; now there are only four at work. In the same villagers
in 1832 and 1833, and the two following years respectively 713 5/8,
312,and 552 quarters of barley were malted. At Brickfield, near
Blackness, a valuable field of clay, averaging 12 feet deep, has
been wrought for some years past, which, in 1834, gave employ-
ment to twelve men, and then yielded at an average yearly 150,000
bricks, 200,000 roofing tiles, and 200,000 draining tiles, Since
then, the demand for the latter has been greatly on the, increase.
Some years ago, there was at Blackness a chemical work in opera-
tion, for the manufacture of sada, Barilla ash, and Roman cement;
