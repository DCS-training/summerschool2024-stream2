     Names and Extent.

   ARRAN is derived from the Celtic word Arin. Ar,
signifies high, and In an island.  Kilbride is said to
be compounded of Kil, a burying place, and Bride, a con-
traction for Bridget, the name of an ancient saint.  The ex-
tent of the parish, from Dippin on the south, to Lochranza on
the north, is 14 miles.  A ridge of hills separates it, on the
west, from Kilmorie.  The isle of Arran is 7 miles in breadth.

   Soil, Produce and Cattle.-The soil is hard and storey.
Most of the farms lying on the declivity of hills, the best
prepared land scarce yields two returns.  To supply the de-
ficiency of corn, the inhabitants plant great quantities of po-
tatoes, which are their principal food for 9 months in the
year.  They lay out, upon seed corn and meal, about 500L.
