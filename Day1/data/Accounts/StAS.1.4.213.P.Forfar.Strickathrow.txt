riages and the births of their children registered, than pay
the tax; whereas, in the case of burials, the mortcloth is
always employed, for the hire of which the clerk must ac-
count to the session.  The number of children produced 
from each marriage, at an average, is between 4 and 5-
In 1790, the number of deaths was considerably greater
than usual, occasioned by the ravages of a nervous fever,
and which raged most in marshy places.  There are in the
parish, 8 heritors, 3 of whom reside; 27 farmers, and 16
families of tradesmen.

   Stipend, Church, Poor, etc.-The stipend is L. 322, 17 s.
4 d. Scots, including L. 30 for communion elements, 13
bolls of oats, 23 3/4 bolls of meal, and 23 1/2 bolls of bear, the
whole not exceeding, at an average, L. 65 Sterling a-year.
Of the above, there is a part paid out of the neighbouring
parish of Brechin.  The manse was built in 1748; and,
as this district is composed of two united parishes, the mi-
nister has two glebes, one of 5, and the other of 3 acres,
though, as the latter lies at the distance of 2 miles from
the manse, it is of little value.  The church is little better
than a heap of ruins, and has all the marks of great anti-
quity.  In Popish and Episcopal times, it was the church
of the Chantor of the Cathedral of Brechin.  In the church-
yard are 3 graves, which, according to tradition, are the
burial places of 3 Danish Generals.-Besides families who 
receive occasional supplies, there are 10 poor on the roll;
one of this is the lunatic, and for some years cost the parish
L. 10, but the expence is now reduced to L. 7 a-year; the
others are maintained in their own houses.  The funds a-
rise from the weekly collections, which, on an average,
are 4 s. 7 d. the profits of the mortcloth, and the interest
of L. 187 capital stock, amounting altogether to about L. 22
a-year.
