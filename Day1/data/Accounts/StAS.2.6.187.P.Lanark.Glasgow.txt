	Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod fo Glasgow and Ayr.--The
Presbytery formerly consisted of ten ministers od the city, and those of
the twelve surrounding parishes, viz. Barony of Glasgow, Gorbals,
Rutherglen, Cumbernauld, Carmunnock, Cadder, Campsie, govan,
Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Cathcart, and Eaglesham, with their elders;
but as the thirteen ministers of the chapels of ease have now been
raised to the status of parish ministers, the clerical members of
Presbytery are increased to thirty-fivd. The Presbytery of Glas-
gow in 1835, for the first time, sent six ministers and three elders
to the General Assembly.
	The synod consists of eight presbyteries, viz. Glasgow, Ayr, Ir-
vine, Paisley, Hamilton, Lanark, Dumbarton, and the new Pres-
bytery of Greenock.
	The following is a view of the progressive stipends of nine of the
ministers of Glasgow. Till 1788, the stipends were paid in Scots
money, viz. in merks converted into pounds Sterling.
