however, are not well planned, little pains having been taken
to keep them upon level ground, which might easily have
been done.  There is a turnpike in the parish, upon the 
great road from Queensferry to Perth.  It was erected in 
the year 1753.  In 1756 it was let, and produced 40 L. 15 s.
a year. In 1762 it rose to 115 L.  At present it produces
250 L. or 260 L. a year.  In 1790, it was let for 300 L.; but
either this was too high, or the candidates for it, had com-
bined to lower the rent; for it afterwards fell to 230 L.
Upon several of the hills there are the remains of forts,
which appear to have been constructed with a great deal of 
labour.  They are supposed to have been the work of the
Romans, and to have formed part of a chain of posts, run-
ning from east to west, intended to defend their conquests
against the incursions of the people from the north.  They
are found in 4 places of the parish.  The most remarkable 
of them is upon the top of Drumglow, the highest hill in
the parish, or in the neighbourhood.  About a mile north 
from this hill, in the low ground, several urns were found in
spring 1791.  Four of them were got under a large stone,
and some others among a heap of small stones.  They con-
tained human bodies, mixed with ashes and pieces of charcoal.
The urns, when broken, appear to have been made of very
coarse materials.  The outside is pretty well glazed, and orna-
mented with dotted lines.-Personal services are only performed
by one tenant in the parish.  He is bound to assist his landlord
in making and stacking his meadow hay, and to carry 90 loads
of coals, (18 stones each), to his house.-The greatest part
of the names of places seem to be derived from the Gaelic,
as Drumlochran, Drumglow, Lochglow, Dowhill, Dowlach,
Blaircrumbeth, Binn, &c.-The nearest post town is Kanross.
The general character of the people is good.  No murders 
have been committed in the parish, nor has any person been
