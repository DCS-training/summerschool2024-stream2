fed in the parish.  This, though a more severe and more ex-
hausting employment, on account of the great quantity of sa-
liva requisite is deemed more profitable.  The women here
use all two-handed wheels, as they call them; they are in
general capital spinners, and bring a deal of money into the 
parish.  Their common stint is from 20 to 24 cuts a-day;
but some of them on a stretch, it is said, will spin double
that quantity:  For every spindle, or four 12 cut hanks
spun, they receive commonly about 1 s.  Sterling.  The
men are mostly employed in husbandry.  There are as
many tradesmen as suppy the exigences of the parish, ex-

pleasantly situated; but the tenants houses in general have
a very mean appearance, which gives strangers a strong im-
pression of the poverty of the country.  There are few pla-
ces where decent farm-houses could be erected as less ex-
pense than in this parish, for it has within itself almost all
the materials requisite; plenty of stones, clay, lime, fir-
timber, and even slate; but, notwithstanding these advan-
tages, little reformations in this way can be expected, till
the proprietors give more encouragement to their tenants
than they have hitherto done.-The language spoken is
English, or rather broad Scotch, excepting in Curgarff.
The people there, especially in the upper part of that di-
strict, speak also a kind of Gaelic ; but that language a-
mong them is much on the decline*.-The ancient inha-

told, derived from the Gaelic; as Ballabeg, the little town; Tolahespick,
the bishop's hollow; Dhalachlirich, the clark's haugh; Don or Dhoin,

turns through deep-marsby level ground; Nochtie, or Nuaclide, the cold
