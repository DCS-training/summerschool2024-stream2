Neither the, Roman camp upon the Marquis of Lothian's ground
to the west, nor that farther down the country, retain their dis-
tinctive characteristics so well define as the one in this parish.
   Parochial Registers.-The parochial registers have been kept
with very commendable regularity since 1687; in which year, the
ordination of the first minister after the Revolution is thus record-
ed in the register of discipline: "November (1687,) Mr Mathew
Selkrig was ordained minister of Crichton by the Presbyterian
persuasion at Steils Mains. His call was given by certain heritors
and people of the parishes of Crichton, Cranston, Ormiston, and
Humbie."
