     of Kirkmahoe.

   Schools.-There is one legal school and schoolmaster in the
parish.  His salary, together with some mortified money,
amounts to L. 8:7:8; and by the common school wages for
teaching, his income may rise to more than double that sum.
There are other schools in some of the villages; one in particu-
lar, on the estate of Dalswinton, to the support of which Mr.
Miller generously contributes.  There are few or none in the
parish, any way advanced in life, who are not capable of
reading English, and in general, who have not learned a lit-
tle writing and arithmetic.

   Ale-houses.-Within these few years the number of ale-hou-
ses has greatly diminished.  By the additional taxes upon malt,
and the more rigid exactions of excife-men, people do not
find it worth their while to sell ale:  There were at any rate,
but few in the parish.  Of late selling whisky and other spi-
rits, has chiefly prevailed.  This must, at times, produce the
common effects attending the use of spirituous liquors.  The
people, however, are in general sober and industrious.
