but in 1639, commissioners from the General Assembly, at
that time more powerful than Parliament, suppressed the of-
fices of canonist and cantor, as being supersluous.

   Thus, contrary to what has happened at St. Andrew's
and Glasgow, the original foundation of this College still
continues in force with very few exceptions.  The most ma-
terial alteration introduced by the nova fundatio regarded the
studentes in theologia, or regents in arts; who, in consequence
of it, became "quatuor regentes qui juventute instituend‘ present
"et Principali auxiliarentur, quorum unus past Principalem sub-
"principalis dicitur, cui quarta classis commissa est."  The fourth
regent was to be prafectus prim‘ et infirme classes, in which he
taught the Greek language; and the second and third had
their several departments in philosophy and mathematics as-
signed to them: and thus all of them became fixed and per-
manent masters and regents in the College.  This constitu-
tion, thus introduced, continued, notwithstanding the resto-
ration of Bishop Elphinston's foundation: the regents at
that period, and down to the present time, appearing, from
the records of the University, to have been permanent, and
to enjoy all the privileges of the other masters, such as sitting
at college meetings, and voting at all elections*.

*About the year 1741 the rights and privilages of the regents were called
in question on occassion of the election of Sir William Forbes to the office of
civilist: and a process of declarator having been raised before the Court of Ses-
sion by Sir William the Regents against Principal George Chalmers and
the masters on the opposite side of the question, Sir William's election was
found good on account of the regents, votes being sustained, and as a separate
head of declarator it was found that the regents had a permanent right to fit
in all colles meetings, and to and enjoy every privilage
competent to the other members of Bishop Elphinston's foundation.
