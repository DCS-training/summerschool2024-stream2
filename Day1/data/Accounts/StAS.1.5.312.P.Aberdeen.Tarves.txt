   Miscellaneous Observations.-The public roads through
the parish, on which the statute labour is employed, are in
tolerable repair-  There is a small village by the church,
which has been on the decline for several years past.  For-
merly a fair almost monthly was held in it, for black cat-
tle, horses, merchandise, etc. now there are only 5 or 6
fairs or markets in the parish.

*No register of deaths is kept in the parish.
