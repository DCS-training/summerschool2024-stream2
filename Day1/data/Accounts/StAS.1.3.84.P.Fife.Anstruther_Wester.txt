consisting of a large stone at each end and side.

   Isle of May.-South-east from Anstruther-Wester, and six
miles distant from it, in the mouth of the Frith of Forth,
stands the Island of May; which, after the desolation of the
Abbacy of Pittenweem, was supposed to belong to the pa-
rish of Anstruther-Wester, the mother church, and in this
light it was annually visited by the minister of Anstruther-
Wester, while it was inhabited by 14 or 15 families.

   It is computed to be one mile long, and three quarters of
a mile broad; it has a well of fine water, and a small lake,
and affords excellent pasture for sheep.  It is frequented by
a great variety of sea fowl, such as kittiewakes, scarts, dun-
ters, gulls, sea-pyets, marrots, etc.

   On the island is a light-house, erected upon a tower 45
feet high; it was built in the reign of King Charles I. and
a duty is exacted, of 2 d. per ton, upon all ships which pass
the island.  The architect, who planned and built the tower,
perished in his return to his house, in a storm, which some
old women, then supposed to be witches, were burnt for raising.
There was a priory on this island, for some monks of the order
of St Augustine; it belonged first to the abbacy of St Andrews,
and afterwards to Pittenweem.  There was a chapel dedicated
to St Adrian, who was murdered by the Danes, in one of their
incursions, and buried here in the 870.  There is a stone
coffin which has stood exposed to the injuries of the wea-
ther, time immemorial, in the church-yard.  Tradition says
that it once contained the reliques of St Adrian.
