but now only three or four have any at all.  This is principal-
ly owing to the introduction of turnips, sown grass, and plant-
ing, and the want of winter herding.-The farms are
mostly laboured by servants engaged for the half year.  Day-
labourers would be more for the advantage of farmers, could
they be readily got, when wanted.  The wages of men servants
per year, besides victuals, are from L. 4:10 s. to L. 6 sterling;
of women, from L. 2 to L. 2:10 s.  Of men, for shearing in
harvest, from L. 1 to L. 1:10 s. of women, for ditto, from
15 s. to L. 1.  Of men shearing per day, 8 d. of women, dit-
to, 6 d.  Day-labourers, without victuals, 9 d.

   Eclesiastical State, Poor, School.-There are two clergymen,
the minister of the established church, and that of the Scotch
Episcopal church.  The stipend is two chalders of bear, and
L. 61:2: 2 2/3 in money, including 100 merks for communion
elements.  The glebe conflicts of 4 1/2 acres; besides which, there
is an allowance of L. 1:14: 0 1/3 for grass.  Lord Saltoun is
patron.  The manse was built in 1758, and was repaired
lately.  The church was erected about 1575.  It is in the 
form of a cross.  Those of the Episcopal persuasion have late-
ly built a very near chapel.  Their congregation is made up
from this and some of the neighbouring parishes.
   The number of poor persons receiving charity, is about 86.
The amount of the collections and funds for their support, is
at an average, annually about L. 50.  The year 1782 added
several to the list, whilst it diminished the public funds.
The failure of the crop, that year, was severely felt in this
parish; but the effects of it would have been more heavy, had
not the heritors, and gentlemen of the town and vicinity,
contributed largely, along with the church session, for the re-
lief of the necessitous, and likewise imported flour and grain,
which they sold out, often under prime cost.  It is pleasing
