                   The chief apparent causes of the increasing population are im-
                 provements in agriculture, extension of the fisheries, and more ge-
                 neral division of labour.
                   The yearly average of recorded births (and care is taken to have
                 all regularly registered) for the last seven years, is 67; that of
                 the deaths may estimated at 14, though in this particular the
                 registration is not so correct; and that of the marriages at 15.
                   In 1821, a year for which there exist the best possible data, the
