   Agriculture, Sheep-grazing, etc-Though the lands in this
parish are better calculated for pasture than village, yet the
few fields along the sea coast, might be turned to much
better account.  The people, however, are so prejudiced
in favour of the ancient mode of farming, that they can
hardly be persuaded to adopt any other; so that the same
bad husbandry, that prevailed in this country 40 years ago, 
still obtains.  Instead of a rotation of crop, suited to the
soil, they have, for the most part, a succession of the same
crop for two or three years.  The crops, principally raised,
are oats, bear and potatoes.  After the first break they ge-
nerally sow bear, then two crops of oats successively.
Sea weed is used as manure for oats, and, where the land
has rested for two or three years, produces good crops.
The ground is manured for bear and potatoes, with the
dung of their black cattle, housed in winter; and though
there is limestone in the parish, the oppresive duty upon
coals, and the distance of every other fuel, make the ex-
pence of burning lime so enormous, that the people cannot 
afford to lay it on their land.-The only person in this pa-
rish, who has paid particular attention to farming, is James
Lamont, Esq; of Knockdow, a gentleman of considera-
ble landed property; who, under many disadvantages of
climate and soil, raises green crops, equal to any in the
west of Scotland.  He manures his ground strongly, some-
times with lime, and at other times with a mixture of
lime and earth, as it suits his land.  His returns of bear
are from 8 to 10 bolls an acre; and of oats from 6 to 8.  He
has practiced, with success, what was never known before
in this country, however frequent in the southern parts of
Scotland,-the plan of feeding sheep on turnips in the
fields.  In this manner, the sheep are fattened with little
trouble, the land manured, and the necessity of summer
fallow precluded.-The farmers, in his immediate neigh-
