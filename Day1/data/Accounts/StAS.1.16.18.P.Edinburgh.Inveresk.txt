burgh; and when the boats come in late to the harbour in 
the forenoon, so as to laeve them no more than time to 
reach Edinburgh before dinner, it is not unusual for them 
to perform their journey of five miles, by relays, three of 
them being employed in carrying one basket, and shifting 
it from one to another every hundred yards, by which 
means they have been known to arrive at the Fishmarket 
in less than 1/4 ths of an hour*.

   While haddocks were in abudance on the coast, great
quantities were taken by the seven boats fo Fisherrow; 
though the best fifh for many years have been brought
three times a-week from Eyemouth in horseback, and un- 
loaded here, to be carried in creels to Edinburgh, by which 
means the carriers are enabled to reach home the same day. 
For seven years past, since the haddocks have disappeared, 
and few fifh are to be caught by the Fisherrow boatmen, 
on account of their distance from deep water, where the 
fifh are to be found, it is usual for them to meet the boats 
from the east end of Fife, half way down the frith, and to 
purchase their fifh.  In the summer season the boats from
that coast frequently run over to Fisherrow, and fell their 
cargoes to the fifh-women here.  This they do rather than
run up to Leith, because they can dispote of their fifh im-
mediately, and fail home again to their respective harbours 
on the same day, with the ebb tide.  The fifh wives who
carry to Edinburgh, gain at least 1 s. a-day, and frequently
ouble and triple that sum.

   From the kind of life these women lead, it may naturally be
concluded, that their manners are peculiar, as they certainly

*It is a well attested fact, that three of them, not many years ago, 
went from Dunbar to Edinburgh, which is 27 miles, with each of them a 
load of herrings on her back of 200 l b, in 5 hours.  They sometimes
carry loads of 250 l b.
