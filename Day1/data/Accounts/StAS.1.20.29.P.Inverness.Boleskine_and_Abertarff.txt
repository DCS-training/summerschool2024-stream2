lent subject of improvement, when drained and sufficiently
manured with lime.  It should not be omitted, that some of
the principal tacksmen in this country, have of late years
been in the practice, of ploughing their ground, in the latter
end of harvest, and beginning of winter; but the generality
of sub-tenants continue the old mode of labouring, which,
so far as we have been able to learn, was as follows: When
a field was 3, 4, or 5 years lea, and failed to produce any 
grass, if calculated for bear, it received on ploughing as
soon after harvest as was convenient, and in spring it was
spread over with a compost of old divot, fod or turf, and
dung, and in the beginning of summer the lands were a se-
cond time ploughed, and sown with bear, and afterwards
yarly with black oats, while it yielded any tolerable pro-
cue: if unfit for bear, it was tauthed in the preceding
summer, or covered with the same compost as above-men-
tioned during the winter, and so on successively cropt with
oats, every following year, in a manner above specified; and
it was no uncommon practice, for a farmer to take 5 or 6 
successive crops of oats from the same field; the reason as-
signed for this frequency of crops is, that the severity of the
winter storms rendering it necessary for the inhabitants to 
house their cattle, it was expedient, by every method, to pro-
vide the means of their subsistence.

   Produce.-The grain of this country, was anciently bear
and black oats; and before the introduction of sheep, the
country abounded in black cattle, an on them the tenants
chiefly relied for payment of their rents; and we have been
assured, that the number of cattle annually fold from this pa-
rish, would exceed 800.  In Abertarf, from the mildness of 
the climate, these cattle were often disposed of early in the
year; but in Stratherrick they were so reduced during the
course of the winter, as not to be saleable till the months of
