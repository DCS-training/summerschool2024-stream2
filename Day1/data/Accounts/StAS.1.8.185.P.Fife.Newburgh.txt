ing food, either for feeding young cattle, and raising them to
a greater size, or fattening the old, and bringing them to a
better market.  Clover and rye grass are generally sown with
the barley; and, after a crop of grass has been taken for one
year, the ground is again broke up for oats.  Wheat is sown
after fallow or after pulse, but commonly after fallow.  Ma-
nure is laid on the fallow, or when the land is undergoing
preparation for a pease crop.  When the season will admit,
beans, or a mixture of beans and pease, are sown upon the
manure, and plowed in.  Wheat is not sown so early as for-
merly, even upon fallow.  Farmers are of opinion, that very
early sowing seldom produces the largest head, or the heaviest
grain of wheat.  Oats are sown from the beginning of March
to the end of April, and the feed, generally made use of, is a
species of oats termed Grange-bothrey, from a farm of that
name, in the county of Angus.  Barley is sown in the end
of April, and through the whole of May.  Most of the feed
employed is a mixture of different kinds, originally imported
from England.  Though the lands, being under better cul-
ture than formerly, yield greater quantities of barley, it is re-
marked, that its quality seems not to be equal.  Whether this
be owing to the frequent lowing of wheat, or to the intro-
duction of lime, as a manure, experience has not yet enabled
the farmer to determine.  The quantity of grain, raised in
this parish, is by no means equal to the maintenance of its in-
habitants; but the deficiency is abundantly matte up by the
neighbourhood.

   Population, etc.-From the report of one, who, during the
indisposition of the writer, was employed to ascertain the
number of the parishioners, it appears, that the parish, at
large, contains 1664 souls, of whom 1552 belong to the town,
suburbs, and shore of Newburgh, and 112 to the country part
