precedence among the eight different families or proprietors of

to have been divided; --is so well konown, that it would be superflu-

   Modern Buildings.--Barrogil Castle, the seat of the Earls of
Caithness, has of late received great additions, and is now an ele-
gant building, but from its not having been inhabited for many
years, is in a state of disrepair.  The mansion house of Brabster
is situated in an inland part of the parish, and is not now inhabited :
its owner, George S. Sinclair, Esq. has lately enlarged the House
of West Canisby, situated on a part of his property near the sea,
and rendered it a comfortable residence.
   The parish church recieved a very extensive repair in the years
1832-33.  It was newly floored, seated, and roofted.

   The only permanent residing heritor is George Sutherland
Sinclair, Esq. of Brabster.  The Earl of Caithness occasionally
passes a few months at Barrogill Castle.
   The are only two farms in the parish, with  the exception of
what the heritors themselves cultivate, that let for more than L.50
per annum. The inhabitants in general rent small possessions,
varying from L.1 to L.30 per annum. The most common rent is
from L. 5 to L.20.  The principal dependence of the people is
upon fishing, and, with very few exceptions, all the males fish for
themselves and their families.
   The houses in general are built partly of stones and partly of turf:
they are roofed with turf and straw, and contain two apartments.
   The people are sober and industrious, and, were it not for the
excessively high rents, would be contented with their situation and
circumstances.
   There are at present in the parish 2 insane, 3 idiots, 3 blind,
2 deaf and dumb children.
