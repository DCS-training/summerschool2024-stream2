rent is rather above 800 L. Sterling.  The great rise in this
property has taken place within these 4 years; and there has
been nearly the same proportion with regard to the rise of
rent in the rest of the pasture and arable land.  The great
demand for black cattle, and the sheep stocks, brought the ex-
tensive hill land (the greatest part of which is covered with
heath), into repute, which, about 40 years ago. and even af-
ter that period, was very low rented, as of little value to
either possessor or proprietor.  On this, property, there is about
600 L. said to be laid out in stone dikes.  The rent of cot
houses, the only kind that are let, will be from 10 s. to 15 s.,
without either grass or potatoe land:  The services are 12
days with their victuals; but there being few residing heri-
tors, these services are mostly commuted to both cotters and
tenants, the cotters for 6 d per day, the tenants for 1 s.; they
being still, however, liable for services with horses.

   Stock and Produce.-As to the average value of the live
stock, it is not easy ascertained with any great accuracy, the
knowing ones, in that way, differing in opinion; yet at a me-
dium, it may be from 4 L. to 4 L. 10 s. the cow, of 3 years old
and upwards; the horses from 7 L. to 8 L. above 2 years old;
the sheep in the stock way, being the black faced kind, about
12 s.; The small tenants sheep, being of an inferior kind,
from 5 s. 6 d. to 6 s. Wool, clean and tarred, 7 s. the stone,
of 24 English pounds; cheese, 5 s. when soft and green;
butter, 12 s. the stone:  Common fowls, a hen, 6 d., the cock,
4d.; the dozen of eggs, 2 d.  The last articles seem upon
the rise, there being a weekly packet from Loch Gilp to Green-
ock, which brought on a considerable demand.-As to the
annual produce, it can hardly be ascertained with any degree
of accuracy, the land not being laid out by acres, nor the
people very exact as to the quantity of seed they sow; but
