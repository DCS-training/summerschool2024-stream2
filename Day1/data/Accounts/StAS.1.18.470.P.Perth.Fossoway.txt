there has been a very close friendship between the two fa-
milies ever since.
   On the barony of Coldrain, or Collin's Drains, as it is
originally styled, there is a place called Hall-Yard, adjoining
to the present tenant's house.  Its form is an oblong square,
with the corners a little rounded.  It contains 3 roods and
36 falls Scottish measure of land, considerably raised above
the surface of the ground, on the north, east, and south.
It is surrounded with a ditch, which at present is in most
places pretty entire.  It is from 15 to 20 feet wide, and al-
though much grown up at the bottom, is about 5 feet deep
below the level of the yard; and as there are two or 3 springs
of water in the ditch, it is probable that it was originally
filled with water.  Within this area stood a building, which
seems to have been of some note and strength; and from the
foundation of which, not many years ago, large stones were
dug up.  The country tradition is, that it was a hunting
place, belonging to the Earls of Atholl.  It belongs at pre-
sent, to James Stedman of Whinfield near Kinross, and is
considered as an antiquity, for the same reason as the Palace
Brae.
   The whole of the barony of Coldrain, originally belonged
to the Earls of Atholl.  This appears from the copy of a
charter of apprising, in possession of the above mentioned
gentleman.  This charter is dated at Edinburgh the 26th
December 1609.  It appears that Umquhille, John Earl of
Atholl, father to James Earl of Atholl, Lord Innermay and
Balvany, owed a debt of 17,348 merks Scots, to Sir David
Henry of Lethindy; for which, the whole barony was ad-
judge.  The lands were adjudged by a special jury, to be
worth no more than 10,000 merks; and 500 merks to the
Sheriff appointed on the business.  As no person appeared
for the family of Atholl, to satisfy Sir David in payment,
