it, particularly in the spring.  The farmers are in general too
late in sowing them.  Turnips cannot be raised to a great

parish of Hounam are considerably later.

   Rent of the Parish.-The land-rent is L. 2720.  It has risert
more than a third within these last fifteen years.  The valued
rent is L. 914:4:9.  There are 8 heritors in the parish, 2
of whom are resident.  There are only 14 farms, which, at
an average, are from L. 250 to L. 300 per annum.  The 
number of sheep on a farm is from 50 to 100 score.

victual stipend is now fixed at 63 bolls.  There is no pa-
