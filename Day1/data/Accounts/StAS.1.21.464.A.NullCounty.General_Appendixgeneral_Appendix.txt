observation of facts, they cannot, if accurately adhered to,
differ widely.
   Let it also be remarked, that the actual value of the lands
does not certainly appear by these computations; only the
present value is shewn, according to the method of farming
that obtains, anno 1798.  Another mode of farming, and
other times, may occasion a total alteration.  When this oc-
curs, it will be curious to look back, and trace the modes of
1798.
   It will be seen that the charges of farming are very heavy
in this parish, and the expence of manure a heavy drawback
on the lands.  On the other hand, the lands admit of great
improvement; and as the soil is superior in quality, no ex-
pence laid out in improving is thrown away.  In the course of
time, there is no doubt that the lands in Wamphray will rise
considerably in their value.  At least a thousand acres more
of good soil will be improved; and it is hoped the method
of exhausting white crops will give place to a better, and
good pasture surface become an object to all concerned.
