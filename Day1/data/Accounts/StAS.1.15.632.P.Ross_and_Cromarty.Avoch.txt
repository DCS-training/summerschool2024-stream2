will think it much more expedient to pay them.  Whether
this scheme, however, on the whole, shall more effectually
promote the public good than the former, the county will
be better enabled to judge, after some years experience.

   Language.-Although most names of places, and many
surnames of persons here are evidently derived from the Gae-
lic, the inhabitants, in general, of this and the two neigh-
bouring parishes, of Rosemarky and Cromarty, understand
and use the English language.  They speak it also more
purely, and with less of a provincial accent or drawl, than
those of many southern counties in Scotland.  Hence some
have supposed them to be the descendents of a colony brought
from some distant part of the kingdom, especially as the com-
mon people in all the contiguous parishes around, speak most-
ly in Gaelic; and two-thirds of them understand no other
tongue.  Whereas, in this parish, there are only six or eight
families unacquainted with the English language, and three-
fourths of the parishioners use it in common.  Nor has any
Gaelic been preached in the church of Avoch since the be-
ginning of this century, although one or two of the ministers
understood it perfectly, and could deliver their sentiments in
that language with fluency.  The prevalence, however, of
the English language in this corner, may be more easily ac-
counted for, from the more frequent intercourse of its inha-
bitants by both sea and land, with those of the southern pro-
vinces.
   The patronage of this parish belongs to Miss Brodie of
Lethen.  The stipend, including an augmentation lately de-
creed, consists of six chalders, part barley, part meal; 46 L.
Sterling, money; 6 L. of conversion for the vicarage and fish
tiends; and 5 L. more for communion clements.  The glebe,
in three separate spots, all arable, measures nearly six acres.
