leys or passes that can be easily fortified against an enemy
and thus, while the hills of Scotia are the parents of so many
benefits, they overlook our foes with contempt.
   The navigation of the Forth and Teith, then, must be of
infinite benefit in a national view, as a part of that general
plan which ought to be adopted over the whole kingdom
namely, of extending inland navigation.  But let us consider
the local situation of this district.  The river Forth runs
through a fine level country, of rich deep clay, about 27
miles long, and 3 broad.  The Teith unites with Forth about
3 miles from the town of Down, to which a canal could be
easily cut, or the river made navigable.  From Down to Kil-
mahog, (a mile beyond Callander), a distance of 9 miles, the
river has a considerable fall, which would increase the ex-
pence of navigation; but this part of the river being very
eligible for water machinery, the advantage would soon re-
pay the cost.
   The beautiful countries along the banks of these two rivers
form one grand bason, surrounded with stupendous rocks and
mountains, comprehending the parishes of Stirling, Gargun-
nock, Kippen, Aberfoil, Port of Monteith, Callander, Kil-
madock, and Lecropt; and also part of Dumblane, Logie,
St. Ninians, Balfron, Buchanan, Drymen, and Killearn.  The
inhabitants of this large district of the kingdom, as well as
the whole parish of Balquhidder, and a great way to the
north of that, bring their coal and lime from Bannockburn
and its neighbourhood, by land carriage.  The rim of moun-
tains surrounding this country stops all communication with
the neighbouring districts, except at a few places.  The line
of roads, therefore, runs east and west; and all commodities
imported or exported, must be conveyed in the same direc-
