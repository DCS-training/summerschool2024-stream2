miles. The number of sittings, allowing 18 inches to each, is
502, the occupancy,of which was found, in 1836, to be engrossed
by a total population of 818. Of the sittings, 214 were formerly
let, besides others let in a smuggled way by some of the farmers.
But it is believed that few, if any, will be let in future ; the peo-
ple being convinced, since their attention was recently directed to
the matter, that the imposition of seat rents is illegal. An end,
it is hoped, has thus been put to what the minister regards, and
has publicly denounced, as a system of ungodly merchandize. The
church is by far too small for the parish.
  The stipend awarded by the Court of Teinds in 1815, was 216
bolls, half meal and half barley, besides 6 bolls meal, in lieu of
the old glebe of Crombie; L. 1, 13s, 4d. for foggage, and L. 8,
6s. 8d. for communion elements. But, when allocated, owing to
an apparent want of funds, the amount, including the allowance
for the glebe of Crombie, for foggage and for communion elements,
was found to be only 91 bolls, 3 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies meal ;
85 bolls,3 firlots, 1 peck, 3 lippies, barley; and L. 20, 5s.
in money. The glebe of Torryburn consists of three acres, and
is let at an annual rent of L. 9. The manse was built in 1768,
and repaired about thirty years ago. Most of the apartments are
small and inconvenient.
  There is no Seceding or Dissenting place of worship in the pa-
rish. The great body of the people profess to adhere to the Es-
tablisbed Church. In 1836, the religious profession of the pa-
rishioners, including children with their parents, was as follows:
