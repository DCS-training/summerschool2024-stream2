  Poor and Parochial Funds.-There are upwards of 30 persons
who receive parochial aid, at the rate of about Is. per week, and
upwards of 40 who receive it occasionally. The annual amount
of collections made for their relief at the church door, including
an extraordinary collection made on the first Sabbath of the year,
may amount to about L. 40; and to this sum is added, for the
same purpose, the interest of L. 360, bequeathed by. different in-
dividuals. There is, besides, an annual assessment laid upon the
heritors, amounting to upwards of L.50. Out of these funds,
however, are paid precentor's salary, beadle's salary, salary of sy-
nod-clerk, presbytery-clerk, presbytery-officer, and session-clerk.
It rarely happens that any indisposition to receive parochial aid is
manifested.
  Fairs.--There is an annual fair on the last Tuesday of July,
chiefly for the purpose of hiring shearers.
   Alehouses.--There are 10 or 11 alehouses in the parish, and
there is every reason to suppose that they tend to injure the mo-
rals of the people.
    Fuel.--Abundance of coal is obtained at a few miles distance,
which sells at 7s. 4d. and 9s. 4d. per ton.

                   MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.

   The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the pa-
rish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac-
count, are,--tbe decrease of the population, which was then rec-
koned at 2350, and now at 1850; the number of buildings which
have been completed; the immense improvements which have been
made in agriculture; and the improvements, scarcely inferior,
which have been made on the state of the roads. The system
of husbandry vies, in point of excellence, with what is carried
on in any district of Scotland, so that, in this respect, the parish
may be considered as not susceptible of improvement.
