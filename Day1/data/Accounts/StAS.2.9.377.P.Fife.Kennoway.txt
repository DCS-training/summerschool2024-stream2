have been occasionally worked ; but, being only two inches thick,
and not affording an adequate remuneration, nothing has been done
in them for a number of years past.
On the western boundary of the parish, there is a patch of peat-
inoss ; and towards the eastern boundary, beds of coal at various
depths are found, some of which have been wrought, with scarcely
any intermission, for nearly fifty years past. The line of dip of
the strata lies in the form f a crescent. Towards the east of the
coal-field, it dips to the southeast, and towards the west, it ap-
proaches to south-west. The dip of the strata is about one foot
in twelve.Slips or fissures, generally rUDDillg in a straight direc-
tion fromeast to west, are found frequently to interrupt the seams
of coal,throwing them up or down to a distance, varying from a
few inches to eight feet.
The following journal shows the metals with their depths re-
spectively, which have been gone through to reach the seams of
coal at present wrought, lying upwards of fifty-four fathoms from
the surface.
