Lord of lords.  From the above statement it will be infer-
red, and with justice, that the farmers in this parish, and in-
deed throughout this country, are, in general, poor; so much
so, that although leases should be granted, it would take
some considerable time before they possibly could adopt an
improved system of husbandry.  What I will a mere theorist
in farming exclaim, Is not one system of husbandry as easily
followed as another?  Does not the modern system require
fewer servants, and less seed; and does it not yield more
luxuriant crops?  Let all these be granted; but what this rea-
soning is to a poor tenant, the following facts will tend to il-
lustrate.  By the present system, it requires the utmost ex-
ertion of his industry, and an almost uninterrupted succes-
sion of crops, to pay his rent and servants, and afford a
maintenance, very sober indeed, to his family.  It may be af-
firmed, that on a farm of 30 acres, 2 L.  per annum has not
been cleared, at an average, by any one farmer, for 20 years,
by farming alone.  Let us suppose a man in this predicament,
from observing the success of others, anxious to lay a fifth
part under grass, say 6 acres; before he can possibly do this
an inclosure is necessary, which, if built by the proprietor,
exhausts, by the payment of 7 1/2 per cent.  interest, the suppo-
sed, or rather real average, profit.  Let him, however, per-
severe to manure this properly, he starves the rest of his
farm.
   The grass is notwithstanding sown at an extra expence of
20 s.  per acre, and cut the second year; but when he calcu-
lates profit and loss, he finds a deficiency of 24 bolls, the
usual average produce of 6 acres; the same the second year
of the improving aera, 48 bolls and 6 L.; so that before he
can experience the benefit of a grass crop, his corn yard
may be probably sold to the highest bidder.  It will be
asked, Why not sell the grass at 6 d. per stone?  for the best
