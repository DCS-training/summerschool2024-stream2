   The small island of Papa Stronsay, lying flat with corn
fields, which have been stimulated by plenty of ware, to raise
luxuriant crops of grain, lyes on the North East side of
Stronsay, is separated from it by a narrow found, over which
two men can row a small boat in five minutes, and adds a
varigated beauty to the prospect on that side.
   The island of Eday, consisting chiefly of hills of a mode-
rate height, and pretty extensive, had been much used of old
for pasture, as appears from ancient rentals, (1598 and pre-
ceeding, in which, a great proportion of its rent is charged
in butter and flesh.  Three fourths of it, at least, consist of
out-freedom, or common pasture, to this day; this common
is covered mostly with heathes, which, in some places, though
not in general, is pretty long, and is divided from the grass
and corn fields, by hill-dykes, a in the days of yore On
this commons a considerable number of sheep, besides horses,

the sheep from straying over the island in summer and harvest; (the ness
sheep have no herds;) but, during the winter, and more than half the spring,
they have full freedom to graze at large over the island.  Borrowhead, and
Rothesholm are also sheep walks; the latter of which, being of great extent,
comprehends the whole peat moss in the stand of Stronsay, from which moss
the inhabitants have, for time immemorial, been in use to cast peats or turf
for firing, on paying a small acknowledgement in money or services, to the
tenant or possessor of the farm of Rothesholm.
   The commons, and sheep pasture above described, are reckoned to be near-
ly two thirds of the whole island.  The other third forms the skirts or bor-
ders of it; where Nature's simple variety hath hitherto been but little en-
croached on by the regular uniformity of art.  Corn fields, of different shapes
and sizes, which fields, no man living ever saw in pasture interspersed with
a proportional extent of grass of different qualities, grass which bears no
traces of having ever been m tillage; these exhibit a scene not unpleasant
in the months of summer and harvest
   The fields too, of natural grass, even in winter, retain a degree of lively
verdure, superior to those in many of the interior parts of Scotland.  It is ob-
servable, that the flatter any of those islands are found to be, the better, use-
ally, is the quality of their grass, and the more lively their verdure.
