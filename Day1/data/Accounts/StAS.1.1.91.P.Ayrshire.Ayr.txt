in the middle, and, probably, was a herenry.  In this lake
are pike and eels, but few trouts.  There is a mineral spring
on the north side of the river, found out near 50 years ago,
and still used by a few poor people.  It comes from a mixture
of coal and iron, and has been thought efficacious in several
disorders.

   Fish.-Haddock and cod have been very plentiful on Air
coast since the herrings left it:  Mackarel has been scarce for
some years past:  Soals and turbot are rare.  White fish are
generally sold at 1 d. per English pound.  The price of sal-
mon in January, and till the month of March, is between 6 d.
and 3 d. per pound.  They are much scarcer than formerly, 
owing, it is supposed, to the liming of land.  The price is 
kept high, too, on account of their being carried to Kilmar-
nock, Irvine, Glasgow, and chiefly Paisley.  Forty years ago,
herrings were caught in great numbers, and sold from 6 d.
to 3 d. per hundred.  Sail-fish of large size are sometimes
taken, whence are got oils for tanners.  The season for white
fish is through the whole year, except about six weeks, from
the end of March till the beginning of May, old stile.  When
herrings were caught at the mouth of Air river, a lamp was
usually placed there.  This lamp was of great use in prevent-
ing ship-wrecks; and the loss of several lives, and loaded ves-
sels, at the end of the year 1789, may be imputed to the want
of it.

   Cultivation and Produce.-Very little ground in this parish
now lies waste or common.  Between 80 and 90 acres, free
to every burgess, for feeding milk cows, was lately inclosed.
About 20 acres of common was feued from the town, little
more than 30 years ago, at L. 112 Sterling, with 18 s 9 d.
of feu-duty.  Being brought into good tillage, and finely
