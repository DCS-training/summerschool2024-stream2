     NUMBER LX.

     PARISH OF KILDONAN.

     (County of Sutherland.)

     By the Rev. Mr Sage.

     Origin of the Name.

   Kildonan, the name of this parish, seems to be of
Gaelic etymology:  It is a compound of Gil (equiva-
lent to the Latin noun Cella, a cell or chapel), and Donan,
the tutelar saint of the parish, in Popish times*.  Similar to
this term, are some other names of places, as Kilearnan, Kil-
pheder, and Kilmuir; which may be translated St. Ierne's, St.
Peter's, and St. Martha's chapels; the last has the annexation

*As an evidence of the high veneration, in which St. Do-
nan was formerly held here, there was a large hollow stone, si-
tuated about 3 miles from the church, and about mid way be-
tween it and Helmsdale, which was called Suigh Donan by
some, and Cathair Donan by others, i. e. St. Donan's Seat, or
Resting Place.  The tradition is, that the saint sat down in it, to
rest himself, when passing through the Strath of Kildonan.
The stone had a cavity, so very capacious, as to hold any person
in the front of it, who, through fatigue or curiosity, chose to
fit down in it.  But an ignorant fellow, from the coast of Su-
therland, wishing to display his muscular strength by lifting it,
let it fall from his hands with such force, that it was dashed to
pieces.  There are some old people still alive, who have seen it
entire, and the incumbent was shewn a fragment of it as a pre-
cious relict.
