tening.  No parish in Scotland feeds cattle richer, or better.
There are at least 1,000 acres of rich pasture grounds, which
will seed as many bullocks or heifers, laid on in May, and
taken off in November, from 20 to 30 stones a piece.  And,
if they are kept to the proper age, (5 or 6 years old), upon
the different stock farms, they will attain from 40 to 70 stone
weight.  Better beef, in point of fatness and quality, is no

   Climate, etc.-Notwithstanding the wind blows chiefly from

frequent showers, and sometimes to long continued rains; yet
the climate, upon the whole, is neither damp nor unhealthy.
This is owing to the nature of its shallow, hazely soil; which,
by admitting the rain to pass easily through its surface, quickly
absorbs and sucks it up.  Unlike to deep, clayey grounds;
which, by long retaining the falling showers upon their sur-
face, permit the rays of the sun again to exhale them.  Hence
the air, impregnated with a constant succession of watery par-
ticles, is kept perpetually dump, which perhaps occasions
these rheumatic and consumptive disorders, that are not often
to be met with here.  In proof of this, there are no epidemi-
cal distempers peculiar to this country.  In general, the cli-
mate is remarkably healthy, and people often attain to a very
great age.-Inoculation is universally practised, and with great
success.

   Springs.-There are no mineral springs within the parish,
of much consequence.  A chalybeate water, mixed with a
little sulphur, has lately been discovered in a field adjoining to
the burgh; but as neither its strength nor virtues have hither-
to been well ascertained, nothing decisive can be said con-
cerning it.  The town is supplied with excellent spring wa-
