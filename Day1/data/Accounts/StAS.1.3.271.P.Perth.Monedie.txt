the wet swampy fields.  They also used to sow oats and rye
intermingled; but now, as by the improvements carrying
on the distinction of out and infield is wearing out, these
crops are disused.  Thet commonly fallow wirh turnips and
potatoes, which are found to be beneficial crops, as well as a
great improvement of the soil.  As all the lands in this
country seem to have been gained at first out of moor
ground, each farm has a good deal of moor intermixed with
the ploughed fields.  The farmers have begun to cultivate
these moors, which are answering very well, and in time
will be converted into good soil, and reward them for their
industry.  The prorietors are beginning to plant the moors
with  firs.  Early pease seemd to agree best with our soils,
and are therefore generally used.  Lint thrives well, which
the old tenants of small farms manufacture into linen, (most
of them being weavers), and find a good market for it in
Perth.  Some of our principal farmers now sow a consider-
able quantity of lint, and expose it to sale upon the field, a
little before it is full ripe; and they commonly make about
L. 12 or L. 14 the acre.  Last year, one farmer got L. 19 per
acre.  Barley-harvest commences usually about the end of
August; when the barley is cut down, the pease are com-
monly ripe; and then follow the oats, when the harvest is
finished.  The crops are got into the barn-yard, before the
end of September, and theb the potatoes are dug up.  In
late seasons the corns are not got in till the end of October.

   Sheep, etc.-Almost every tenant in the parish had for-
merly some sheep, but they were all banished as destructive
to the young hedges, with which the new farms are in-
closed.  But an English gentlemen, who has taken the farm
of Monedie, which Mr Graham has been improving these
two years, has got a score of pregnant ewes, of the Bakewell
