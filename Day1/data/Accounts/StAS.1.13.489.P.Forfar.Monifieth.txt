the parish, as at present they shade several; and with-
in the same period, the extensive and beautiful plantations
around the two seats Fintry and Grange were reared.  The
house of Fintry stands where the Dighty enters the parish,
and is a modern elegant mansion.  Nearly where the Dighty
falls into the aestuary, stands the house of Grange, which 
displays marks of ancient magnificence.

   Population.-According to Dr Webster's reports, the
number of souls in 1755 was 1421.  In this parish there
are at present 1218 persons of all ages.  Of these 620 are 
males, and 598 females.  There are 246 families, of which
233 belong to persons who have been married, and 13 to
persons who were never married.  Below the age of five,
there are 136; between 5 and 10, 183; between 10 and
20, 223; between 20 and 30, 251; between 30 and 40,
132; between 40 and 50, 136; between 50 and 60, 86;
between 60 and 70, 53; between 70 and 80, 15; between
80 and 90, 3.  The three villages of the parish are thus
peopled:  In the village of Drumsturdy-moor, there are
132, viz. 70 males and 62 females; in that on Monifieth,
175, viz. 84 males and 91 females; and in that of the East 
Ferry, 230, viz. 114 males and 116 females.  Of late years 
there have been annually married 12, been born 39, and 
died 18.  The great inequality of deaths to births, seems
to arise from this:  Many inhabitants of this parish early in
life settle in Dundee; many go aboard merchantmen, may
perish by the dangers of the sea, or be impressed into ships
of war, and perish by the hands of the enemy*.

*The parish appears at no former period to have been much more po-
pulous than at present.  About the year 1660, the annual average of mar-
riages was 5:  of births 26:  and deaths 14:  So that whether a calculation
