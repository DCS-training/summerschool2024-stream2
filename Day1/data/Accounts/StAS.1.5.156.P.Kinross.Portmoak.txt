     NUMBER IX.

     PARISH OF PORTMOAK.

     (COUNTY OF KINROSS.)

     By the Rev. Mr ANDREW GRANT.

     Name, Situation, Extent, Surface, and Soil.

   THE name of this parish is derived from St Moak,
in honour of whom a priory was erected on the
banks of Lochleven.  Port was prefixed to it, from its being
the nearest land to the isle of Servanus, and consequently
the usual landing place from the priory of Lochleven,
which was situated in that island.  It is in the presbytery
of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife.  It is of a very irregular
figure; the length, at one place, is 7 miles, and the breadth
5, and contains in all about 6404 acres Scotch measure.
Of these 4054 are arable, 300 moss, 300 meadow, 1400
hill, and 350 muir. The surface presents a great variety of
objects to the eye, a mixture of fertile fields, barren moss,
rich meadows, craggy mountains, and thriving plantations,
lying around a beautiful and extensive lake.  In such an ir-
regular surface, the soil must be various.  There is a tract
of arable ground, which is very fertile, having the loch and
the river of Leven to the south, and being sheltered from
the north by the Lomonds; its length is about five miles,
