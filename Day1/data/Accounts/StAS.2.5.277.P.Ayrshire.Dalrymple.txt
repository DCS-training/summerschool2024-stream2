	Plantations.--The plantations consist of oak, elm, ash, alder,
birch, plane, lime, larch,--silver, spruce, and Scotch fir.
	There are six beautiful oaks in the old garden at Skeldon, sup-
posed to be upwards of 300 years old. A native of this parish,
who died here about five and twenty years ago, on the verge of a
hundred, said, that he remembered no difference in them in the whole
course of his life; and that the aged people in his time spoke of
them as being more than 200 years old. Of two which were mea-
sured lately, one was 12 feet round, and contained within the
branches a circumference of 220 feet; the other was 10 feet round,
and 20 feet from the root to the branches. Near the oaks are se-
veral larches, equal in height and beauty to the generality of those
in the Duke of Atholl's plantations at Dunkeld. Half-way beween
the church and manse, and in the glebe, are two magnificent and
beautiful trees, a sycamore and a horse-chestnut.
