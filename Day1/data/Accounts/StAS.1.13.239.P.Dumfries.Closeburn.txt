the beneficial effects of lime discover themselves remarkably,
both by improving the quality and increasing the quantity of 
potatoes*.-There is nothing remarkable in the implements
of husbandry commonly used.  The plough in most general 
use is the Scots plough, which, the land being somewhat
stony, is found to answer better than any other.  It is made
light, and is for most park drawn by two horses.  One-horse 
carts are much in use; and it is found, that more work can 
be done, and with more ease both to man and horse, by 
these carts, than can be done by the same number of men
and horses with two-horse carts.  There is scarcely a far-
mer in the parish who has not two, some have three, some
four carts.

   Markets.-The only market for black cattle is Dumfries.
From this parish there are sold annually about 100 come
to age, whose price for three or four years has been about
L. 5 the head; 60 or 2 1/2 years old, at L. 4; and 250 of 1 1/2
years old, at L.2, 10 s.  The markets for sheep are Apple-
by and Staigshaw, in England; Lockerby, Langholm, and 
Linton, in Scotland.  The number sold annually is about 
3700 lambs, whose price for some years has been from 3
to 5 guineas the score, that is, for 21, one being always 
given in to the score; 780 hogs or sheep, of a year old past,
from L. 8 to L. 11 the score; and dinmonts, or sheep of 
two years, at from L. 10 to L. 13 the score.  Hardly any 
are fold beyond that age.  Wool is generally bought up at 
the farmers houses, and carried into England to be manu-
factured there.  It is an observation in every body's mouth,

*People begin to sow, if the season permit, about the middle of March
and it is generally near the middle of May before all is finished.  Har-
vest commences for the most part about the 20th of August, and in tole-
rable seasons all is got in by the end of September.
