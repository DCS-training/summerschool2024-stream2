Besides some copies in the rooms are a landscape and thun-
der storm, with cattle and figures, by Tempesta, a view
through a rock by Marterelli, a Moon Light by Vanderneer,
a Piper by Teniers, St Fancis in extacy by A. Carraeci, a
Mendicant by Spagniolet, etc. together with a Sea-piece
of some merit, which is the only old ornament left in one of
the walls above the fire-place.  At Monk's Haugh a fulling
mill and dyehouse, and below Harbour Craig a lint mill has
been built.  On the other side of the garden is a large field,
called the Greenbrae-park, opposite to the Steel and Harley-
