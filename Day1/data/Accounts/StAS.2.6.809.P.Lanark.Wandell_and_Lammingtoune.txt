   The earliest period at which I ever planted early potatoes in
my garden was the 17th of March 1834, and the latest at which
I ever put into the ground a first crop of the same kind, was the 19th
of April 1836.  The earliest time time I ever had new potatoes of my
own raising was on the 7th July 1834; and the latest period be-
fore the same root was fit for using, was the Ist of August 1836;
a season when every article of garden produce was extremely late
in this part of the country.  The present spring, 1840, is the
driest and warmest that I remember ever to have seen, not except-
ing 1826, which as yet it greatly resembles.  Since the 15th of
February, we have had only a very few showers.  The thermome-
ter has been steadily and unusually high, and consequently vege-
tation is nearly a month more advanced than usual.  Fruit trees,
such as apples, pears, plums, and cherries, have blossomed
most luxuriantly in the garden of the manse, and many of them
are beginning to shed very rapidly their honours in the dust !
On one or two trees, both plums and apples, and Jargonelle
pears, are beginning fairly to set in the fruit. Yesterday, May
4th 1840, the thermometer in the shade and open air was nearly
78&deg;, at two o'clock P. M.  The lilac and laburnum are beginning
to open and to shew their beautiful tints.  Gean trees and hawk-
berry or bird-cherry, are in full blow around the manse, and the
old planes behind it have been in leaf for a week past.
   Hydrography, &c.-There are many fine springs in this parish.
The most celebrated is that dedicated to St Ninian, on the, left
bank of Lammingtoune burn, a little above the village.  From
this fountain the villagers used formerly to draw water, but of late
there have been no fewer than five wells sunk by various in-
