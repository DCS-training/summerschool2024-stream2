southern and northern boundaries.  The whole is a beautiful
champaign country, agreeably diversified by vales and gentle
risings.  The eastern part of the parish is rather encumbered
with moss.-The soil is various.  The north and weft parts of
the parish are the best, consisting, generally, of a strong clay
soil, and, when properly cultivated, yield good crops.  The
middle and east parts are of a molly soil, and, in early seasons,
yield good crops of oats and potatoes; but, in cold late sea-
sons, seldom ripen well.  Wheat, barley, pease, beans, oats,
flax, clover, and rye-grass, are sown annually; but oats are
the most general crop.  Great quantities of flax are raised
for sale, some years to the extent of above 100 acres.  The
flax is generally sown the second year after the lands are bro-
ken up from pasture, after a crop of oats or pease.  An acre
of ground let for flax. brings 5 L. or 6 L.  Sterling of rent for
that year.  There are 114 ploughgates of land in the parish.
The ploughgates differ greatly with regard to extent; but,
on an average, may contain from 70 to 80 acres of arable
land, besides pasture and moss, of which last there are some
thousands of acres in the middle and eastern parts of the pa-
rish.  The estates of Airdrie, Rothsolloch, Monkland, and
Rochsoles, are greatly improved, well inclosed, and finely
sheltered with large plantations of forest trees, which thrive
well.  The parish, in general, is inclosed with ditches and
hedges of white thorn; but many of the hedges are bad,
partly owing to want of care, and partly to the mossy soil of
the higher grounds, where it is found, that thorns never
thrive, and seldom live above 20 years.  The best improved
lands are occupied in pastures and let yearly to graziers, for
fattening sheep and black cattle.  By this method, the lands
are not only improved, but also bring more rent, than by
letting them on leases.  Manures of all kinds are rather ex-
