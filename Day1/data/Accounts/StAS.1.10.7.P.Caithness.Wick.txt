called the links of Reiss and Wester, with a good rabbit war-
ren, affording a pleasant ride, and an excellent road in all sea-
sons; though at ebb tide, a more expeditious course is taken
by the sands, which extend about three miles.

   Keiss.-At Keiss in this parish, one of the estates of Sir
John Sinclair, is an excellent mansion house, with an elegant
stair and cupola, built by Sir William Sinclair the former pro-
prietor, but not completely finished.  Below is a castle where
anciently the Earls of Caithness occasionally resided.  This
estate as well as the neighbouring of Nybster, belonging to
Mr Sinclair of Freswick, abound with peat moss.  At Nybster
and Sarclett are small salt-pans, where is made a weak kind
of salt, that sells from 8 d. to 10 d. per peck.

sea-ware, which afford abundance of manure for the land.
The ware is sometimes put into large heaps, and allowed to
rot; and then becomes a very strong manure, dissolving into
a fat saponaceous substance, producing myriads of animalcu-
la, and sometimes it is mixed up in dunghills, with cods-heads,
herring garbage, and brine.  It is cut at ebb tide with corn
hooks from the stones, and burnt into kelp.-As about half
the coast of this parish is steep and rocky, the quantity of
kelp made in it is not considerable, not exceeding, at an
average, from 40 to 50 tons.

   Fisheries.-The fisheries along the shore of this parish,
form an object of considerable importance.  The coast is of
great extent, and abounds with a vast variety of fish, which,
besides what is annually exported, furnishes the inhabitants
