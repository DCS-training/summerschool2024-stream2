the neighbourhood of the town, which thrive tolerably
well; but in general the fruit does not succeed so well in
the higher parts of this parish, owing to the great eleva-
tion.  Small fruit, however, such as gooseberries, yield
considerable returns, and I have known some cultivators
of them draw from 20 L. to 25 L. for a crop, independent of
other vegetables growing among them.  Wild fruits are
here in great abundance, such as crab apples, hazel nuts,
geens, bird-cherry called here hagberry, rasp-berries, Roe-
buck-berries, and strawberries, etc.  The fruit of the
bird-cherry, (prunus padus), or the bark in winter, is an
excellent astringent, and a specific in Diarrhoeas and fluxes.
The disease common to cows in some pastures, called the
moor-ill, is cured by it, of which I have been assured by
an excellent surgeon now deceased.  The Rubus Saxatilis,
and Rubus cbam‘morus, are to be found along the rocks of
Cleghorn wood, and at Bonniton, by the tails.
   There are no mineral waters in the parish other than
the common chalybeate springs, which are found almost
every where in Scotland.

   Roads, Bridges, and Improvements, already made or
proposed.  The distance to Edinburgh is about 30 miles;
and a most excellent turnpike road was made some years
ago to that metropolis.
   The present road to Glasgow, which is 24 miles from
Lanark, is in bad repair; and on account of the great
declivity to the water of Mouss and acclivity from it, it
has been found expedient to change the tract of the road
altogether; and instead of crossing the Mouss, a new one
is finishing, that crosses the Clyde at the old bridge of
Lamark, and from thence runs along the southern banks
