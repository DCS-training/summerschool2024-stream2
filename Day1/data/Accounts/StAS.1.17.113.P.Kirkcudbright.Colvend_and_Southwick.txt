markets in the south-east counties of England.  They ge-
nerally buy upon credit; payments are not expected, until,
in the course of 4 or 5 months, they are enabled to make
them from their returns in the English markets, and conse-
quently must, in a great measure, depend upon their success
there, which they themselves have the exclusive privilege of
reporting to the farmer their creditor.  Of these adventu-
rers, who these many years have obtained the credit and
confidence of the country, the greater number have at one
time or other failed, and some repeatedly.  By such failures
large sums have been lost, honest and industrious farmers
much hurt and reduced, and whole families ruined.  It were
to be wished that the English graziers, or cattle merchants,
were to be seen buying their cattle in our own markets, ra-
ther than that our farmers should be obliged to run such
risks, in trusting their property to so great extent, in the
hands of people, so many of whom they have experienced
to be unworthy of their confidence, in order to get it dis-
posed of in the remotest parts of the island.
