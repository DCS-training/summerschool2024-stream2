of Ballantrae, is in general high and rocky, having a tremen-
dous surf or swell beating against it, when the wind blow
from the west and north-west.  Opposite to this coast the
sea appears land-locked, for a most spacious bay of nearly 25
or 30 leagues diameter is formed by part of the coast of Gal-
loway, the most part of the two counties of Down and An-
trim in Ireland, the east coast of Argyleshire, and part of
Dumbartonshire, and by the whole stretch of coast along the
shire of Ayr for about 80 miles; all this vast extent of coast
is easily discernible by the naked eye in a clear day, together
with the islands of Sana, Annan, Lamlash, Bute, and the two
small islands of Cumbray.  About four or five leagues north-
west from Ballantrae stands the island of Elsay:  It is a most
beautiful rock of a conical figure, covered on the top with
heath and a little grass.  It is not inhabited by any human
creature; but affords refuge to an immense number of sea
fowls who breed on it, and is stocked with rabbits and a few
goats.  It is the property of the Earl of Cassillis; and is
rented at L. 25 Sterling a year, the tenants paying their rent
from the feathers of the different sea sowls, from the solan
geese that breed on it, and the rabbit skins.  It affords a fine
object all round that coast, and a mark for ships either com-
ing into, or going out of the Frith of Clyde.  There is an
old ruinous castle on it, about a third part up the rock,
said by Campbell, in his Political Survey of Britain, to have
been built by Phillip II. of Spain, but on what authority is
not known.  There are four light-houses, one at the new
built harbour of Portpatrick, another at the town of Donag-
hadee, a third on the Mull of Cantyre, and a  fourth on the
island of Cambray; and it might be of singular use to the
towns of Air, Irvine, and Salcoats, which carry on a consi-
derable trade with Ireland, and the towns on the west of
England, is a fifth light-house was erected on a small low
