   Soil.--The soil of the eastern district is light and gravelly, en-
cumbered with many stones, but well inclosed and cultivated; of
the west, cold. and wet, excepting by the river side. Much of it is
still undrained, unsheltered, uninclosed, though generally under
the plough.
   Quarries.--Quarries of fine-grained blue whinstone, presenting
occasionally a vertical columnar fracture, are frequent; and there
are two quarries of excellent freestone; that of Manuelrig, exten-
sively wrought, having vertical fissures filled with the finest blue
clay, and occasional specimens of petrified equisetum; and that
of Haining having a fracture resembling marble; perhaps the finest
grained and most compact specimen of sandstone that can pos-
sibly be found, retaining its angles and chissel-marks unchanged
by the vicissitudes of centuries.*
   Coal is now wrought only at Stanrig and Craigend; but the
following strata, excepting only the uppermost coal, have been
lately ascertained to prevail over the western half of the parish:--
1st, from 5 fathoms to 10 of surface, consisting of stiff clay or
rock; 2d, from 4 feet to 5, fine coal; 3d, 33 fathoms of rock strata
and thin seams of coal; 4th, from 2 feet 8 inches to 3 feet of fine
hard coal; 5th, 14 fathoms of rock strata and one small seam of
coal intervening; 6th, from 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet, very fine
soft coal; 7th, 23 fathoms of rock strata and various thin seams
of coal; 8th, 1 foot 6 inches blaise or bituminous shale, con-
taining three or four bands of ironstone, from 1 to 3 inches
thick--and, 4 feet inferior coal, with frequent balls of iron; 9th,
5 1/2 fathoms white rock; 10th,, from 3 feet to 4, inferior coal;
11th, 9 fathoms rock strata and various thin seams of coal, and a
good band of ironstone, 10 feet above the next coal; 12th, from
1 1/2 foot to 3, Middlerig coal; 13th, 5 fathoms white rock; 14th,
2 1/2 feet of fine coal bored, but not yet seen; 15th, 17 fathoms
white freestone, with great quantities of water, some of the
stone exceedingly hard and difficult to bore.  Of these, the
lower strata are the widest spread, some of them having been
found six miles to the southward.  The dip declines gently to-
wards east-north-east, in which direction the upper seams fall
off, in consequence of the dip of the surface and a great up-dike
to the north-east; and no good coal has yet been found in that
direction. The uppermost coal is of partial extent, even in the,

<FOOTNOTE>A seam of limestone, nine feet thick, has been lately found by Mr Stirling of
Muiravonside, it the foot of the bank below the canal aqueduct, promising abundant
supply.
