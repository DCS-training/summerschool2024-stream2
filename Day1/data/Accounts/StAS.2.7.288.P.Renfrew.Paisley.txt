   If from the above sums we deduct the expenditure on repairs,
furniture, and utensils; on children at nursing out of the house;
on grants to the general session for the poor, &c. the actual cost
of maintaining each pauper in the house will not amount to L.4
per annum.
   Till 1828, the kirk-sessions took entire charge of all the poor
out of the hospital, and to this end were assisted by annual grants
from the hospital assessment.  Since 1828 the burden of manag-
ing the out-door poor, with the exception of those in communion
with the Established churches, has devolved on the directors of the
hospital, with the assistance of about sixty managers, chosen indis-
criminately from the town at large.  The mode of management
thus adopted is essentially the same with that already described in
the Abbey parish.  The gross expenditure for last year on both
in and out-door establishments of the hospital has been L.2502,

   Distributions of Charity by Public Bodies.-There are six incor-
porated societies, (Merchants, Weavers, Wrights, Tailors, Shoe-
makers, Maltmen, &c.) who distribute considerable sums annually
to their poor members; but the amount cannot be ascertained.
Nor, indeed, can these distributions be considered as properly of
an eleemosynary nature.  The members have paid their terms of
entry with the societies, and are thus entitled to relief as may be,
with this limitation, that the precise amount is not settled as in
the case of a friendly society, but is left to the discretion of the
managers.  The following mortifications are lodged in the hands
