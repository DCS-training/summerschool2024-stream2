united into one parish, to be called the United Parishes of
Houstoun and Killallan.  The Lords gave a decreet for that
purpose in the year 1760, with this provision, that the then
incumbents should enjoy their stipends, manses, and glebes,
and exercise their pastoral office in their respective parishes,
till the death, transportation, or deprivation, of the one of
them; and the patrons to exercise the right of presenting in
a vacancy by turns; and ordamed the kirk at Houstoun to
be the only kirk of the united parishes in future.

   Origin of the Name.-Killallan, or Killellen, according to
an inscription on the kirk bell, seems to be a corruption of
Killsillan, i.e. Cella Fillani, the tutelar saint of the parish.
There is a large stone a little distant from the kirk, with a
hollow in the middle, called Fillan's Seat; a little farther, a
spring well, called Fillan's Well, issuing from under a rock,
shaded with bushes hanging over it, to which, it is reported,
that the country women used to bring their weak and ricket-

of cloth as a present, or offering, to the Saint, on the bushes.
This custom continued till about the end of the last century,
when one Mr Hurcheson, who was then minister, caused the 
well to be filled with stones.  There is a fair held in the
month of January, called Fillan's Fair, and Fillan's Day.  The
font stone for holding the holy water, in times of Popery,
stood long without the quire door, after the reformation, but
is now built in the church yard wall.

   Houstoun, in ancient times, was called Hilpeter, i.e. Cella
Peirs, the tutelary saint.  There is a well at a little distance,
to the north west of the church, called St Peter's Well; it is
covered with a wall of cut free-stone, arched in the roof,
from which flows a plentiful stream of excellent water; and
