Parochial Registers.  Our oldest register is - one of births and
baptisms. It conmelices in 1689, and is continued on to 1735. It
is in very bad condition, and two years are wholly awanting. The se-7
c,ond register of births and baptisms, begins 15th May 1737, and ends
June 6, 1784. The third register of births and baptisms begins 8th
June 1784, and ends 14th March 1813. The fourth register of
births and baptisms commences 21st March 1813, and is now be-
ing filled up. The first register of proclamation of banns begins
29th January 1,737, and ends 10th December 179 1. The second be-
gins 5th January 1792, and ends 21st September 1833. The third
begins 27th September 1833, and is being filled up. _ There is no re-
gisterofdeaths,onwhichanykindofreliancocanbeplaced. There
is great' backwardness to registration here of any kind. Regu-
larity'never will b attained, till a Parriamentary enactment enforce
it under penalties.
Antiquities.--In, this parish, there are none.    Tradition has

formation, besides the parochial kick:  One of these had been
placed at the "chappell," another, at the sequestered spot
called "Boon the Brae," near Waterside bleachfield.  The springs
called           th'e Brac," nearwaterside bleachfield.                  The springs
