   Inns, Morals, and Character.-There are 5 public inns
or ale-houses in the parish; and, it is reported, still a
greater number of tippling-houses.  The multiplication of
public-houses, and so general use of spirintous liquors, are
justly thought to have a pernicious effect upon the morals
and character of the people.  It ought, however, in justice
to be mentioned, that there are, in this parish, compara-
tively speaking, few instances of that devotion to the bot-
tle, of which numerous examples are not wanting around
us.  The people in this district are upon the whole, virtu-
ous, intelligent, sober, active. industrious, regular in their at-
tendance upon public worship, and deservedly marked for
their moderation and liberality of sentiment in religious
matters.  Comparatively few instances of fraud and disho-
nesty occur to require the interposition of the civil judge.
They are kind and hospitable to strngers; benovelent
without oftentation; and, when occasion requires, ready to
relieve the wretched.  Enjoying all of them the necessaries,
and many of them, in a considerable degree, the conve-
niencies of life, though ambitious of improving, they seem
in general contented and happy in their present situ-
ation.

a blacksmith.  The price of a pair of man's clogs is about 3 s. including
plating, and with the size, the price diminishes in proportion.  A pair
or clogs, thus plated, will serve a labouring man one year; or, is good
care is taken of them, an year and a half; and at the end of that period,
by renewing the sole and plating, they may be repaired so as to serve an
year longer.  Whether considered with respect to the price or utility,
they are certainly preferable to shoes.  They keep the feet remarkably
warm and comfortable, and entirely exclude all damp, and thence are 
thought to contribute highly to the healthiness of the labouring part of
the community.
