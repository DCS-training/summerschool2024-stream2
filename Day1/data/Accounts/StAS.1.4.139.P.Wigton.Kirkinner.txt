not appear to have been naturally very fertile.  But, by
the benefit of sea-shells, lime, and marl, the soil has been
much improved, and still goes on improving.  In the carse
of Baldern, lies an abundant treasure of sea-shells, which
the proprietor however reserves for the use of hiw own e-
state, in this and two neighbouring parishes.  For the rest
of the parish, they are brought from the other side of the
Frith, and landed at Wigton, for 1 s. 6 d. or 1 s. 8 d. the
ton.  But were the land-carriage comes to exceed 3, or
at utmost 4 miles, our farmers preter lime imported in
shells, from  Whitehaven, or its neighbourhood.  In some
places marl has been found, but it begins to be exhausted.
Our marl is of the shell kind, found in bogs or moss, but
never, I think, in mosses of great extent.  It seems to be
agreed that the substance of the marl, is the shells of the
fresh water wilk.  I have seen a thin stratum of it, begin
to form at the bottom of ponds of standing water.  Our
hills, in their natural state, were covered with furze and
broom; but, from the application of the above manures,
the furze and broom begin to disappear; though both are
still troublesome to the farmer.  The air is rather dry than
moist, compared with that of the more northerly counties
of the west of Scotland, and deserves the character of
healthy.  I have not observed any prevalent distempers.
There is only one mineral spring, and I am well assured it
has been of use to remove complaints of the stomach, and
frequently proved a cure for the ague.  We have many
springs of soft and light water, which I believe contribute
much to the health of the inhabitants.
   The river of Bladnoch is the boundary between this
parish and Wigton, and between this parish and Penning-
ham.  It produces very good salmon, but not in great
quantities, from 3 d. to 4 d. the pound, and none is ex-
ported.  The tide goes up this river but a little way above
