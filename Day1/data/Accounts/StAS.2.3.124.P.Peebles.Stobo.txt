                       III.-POPULATION.
   The state of the population previous to the year 1734 cannot
be traced with any degree of certainty, but from various circum-
stances there is reason to believe the population is now partly di-
minished,-but from what causes it is not so easy to determine.

rish is Sir James Montgomery of Stanhope, Bart.; but there are
four proprietors of land in the parish of the yearly value of L. 50

   Character of the People.-My residence amongst them has been
for upwards of sixty years. I have known in the parish many re-
spectable, benevolent, and kind-hearted parishioners. They are
gone, and I have mourned their loss. Yet they have left behind
them successors to whose integrity of life and manners I am hap-
py to have the opportunity to bear testimony. There is, in one
word, perhaps, no parish where the moral character and conduct
of the people are in all respects more uniformly unexceptionable.
   During the last three years there have been, however, two illegi-
timate births in the parish.
