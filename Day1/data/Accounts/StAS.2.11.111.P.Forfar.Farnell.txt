scale of magnificence hardly exceeded, if equalled, by any in this
part of the country.
   The are two meal and two saw-mills in the parish, but no ma-
nufactories or other mills. One of these saw-mills is occasionally
employed (between twenty and thirty circular saws being fixed
upon the same axis, at a little distance from each other,) for cut-
ting into dust the jaw bones of whales to make manure for land,
especially for raising turnip crops.

   The population has of late been rather on the decrease, owing
principally to the uniting of farms, by which the number of tenants
and labourers and residing families is necessarily diminished.

600 acres in undivided common, which fall to be divided among

best adapted for the soil, and of these chiefly the plantations consist;
but the different kinds of hard-wood might also be cultivated with

of Kinnaird, as well as from the thriving state of such as have been
