receiving parochial aid amounts to nearly 50, and the average sum
allotted to each per year is L.2, 3s. 6d.  The average sum of
church collections for the relief of the poor for the last six
years amounts to L. 50.  This is contributed entirely by the
farmers and labouring classes, the heritors being principally non-
resident.  In consequence of this, an accumulation which had been
made, when the principal heritor, the late Mr Cumine, was resi-
dent in the parish, and steadily and largely contributing to the
poor's funds, is now fast diminishing.  There is a disposition
amongst the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief as long as
they can do without it; and many individuals have actually refus-
ed to accept of it when offered, although some cases of rapacity
do occasionally occur.  In the year 1806, the sum of L.200 Ster-
ling was left by the late Mr Grieve, merchant in Cuminestown,
under the control and management of the kirk-session, the interest
of which, according to the terms of his will, is annually applied to
the relief of poor householders, not paupers, in sums not under
5s., and not exceeding 10s. to each.
   Fairs, &c.-There is an annual horse and cattle fair held in
the village of Cuminestown, on the last Thursday of April, old
style.  The proprietor of Auchry has lately established several
other markets.
   Inns and Alehouses.-There are five inns and alehouses in the
parish, one-half of which might suffice.
   Fuel.-Hitherto peats and turf have been almost the only fuel
used here.  The mosses belonging to the property of Auchry,
whence the villagers have been supplied, are almost entirely ex-
hausted.
