where, but especially near Portwilliam, abounds with variety
of excellent fish, as salmon, herring, mackerel, cod, cyth,
whiting, and others.  Very few of the two first, but con-
siderable quantities of all the rest are sometimes caught; and
there is every reason to believe, that if this fishing was pur-

   Population.-There is, perhaps, no country parish in the
county that has increased so much in population as Mochrum
for these last 20 years.  The inhabitants, who now amount
to 1400, it is certain, did not exceed half the number
previous to that period.  This increase has been almost en-
tirely effected on Sir William Maxwell's estate, who, carry-
ing on extensive plans of improvement upon the lands which
he held in his own natural possession, had occasion to em-
ploy a number of additional labourers, and these happening
to consist mostly of young, stout, newly married Irishmen, this
prolific race soon contributed largely to the human stock.
   Of the lands which he had occasion to let, the worthy pro-
prietor, too, very judiciously divided several large farms into
number of small ones, and thereby put it in the power of
