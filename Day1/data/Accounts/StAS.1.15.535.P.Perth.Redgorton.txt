   There are about 30 weavers, but their number will soon
increase; three smithies, and two master house carpenters, be-
sides those belonging to the public works; there are seven pu-
blic houses, but three would be perfectly sufficient for every
useful purpose.  There are no residing heritors, neither are
there here any physicians, lawyers, or attornies.  There are
14 farms, of which 10 are the property of Colonel Graham.
Besides there, are many small possessions, having attached to
them from one to ten acres.  There seems to be a design
formed, and already carried into execution for about two
miles, to connect these small pendicles and the various villa-
ges; so that within a few years, the whole length of the pa-
rish, which is about six miles, will appear as one connected
village.  There are no oxen used there, either for plowing or
the draught; and as the common plough is generally drawn
by two horses, the number of black cattle reared here is but
small, and generally sold at the age of two or three years.
There is not a man or woman that has either hand or limb
without employment.

   Productions.-The crops raised here are wheat, rye, barley,
oats, pease, turnips, flax, potatoes, and grass-seeds of various
kinds; the one half of the farms being generally in grass.
They export some wheat and rye, large quantities of barley,
some young cattle, and considerable quantities of slates.  They
import some of the larger kind of horses, and great quanti-
ties of oats and oat meal.  There are two small pits of shell-
marle, and the rivers Almond and Shockie are lined with rock
marle, of a reddish colour.  They generally lay 50 bolls of
shell-marle on the acre, but four times that quantity of rock
marle; the former loses it virtue within five years, while the
other continues to operate for fifteen, and seems fully to com-
pensate for the extra expence in digging and carriage.
