outer door of the kitchen was made of strong bars of iron,
as thick as an ordinary man's leg, and the windows were
closed with small grates or twisted stentions of iron, so that
it may be readily supposed that it was almost impregnable
at the period in which it was erected.-There is another
very ancient castle, that of Cadboll, equally old, if not
older than either the abbacy or the castle of Lochlin.
There are little remains of it now, but 2 or 3 vaults.  There
is a very singular and remarkable tradition concerning this
castle, that though it was inhabited for ages, yet never
any person died in it; and many of those who lived in it,
wished to be brought out of it, as they longed for death,
especially Lady May, who resided there about 100 years
ago; being long sick, and longing for death, she desired  to
be brought out of her castle, which at last was accordingly
done, and no sooner did she come out of it, then she ex-
pired!

   Fuel.The principal disadvantage under which this pa-
rish labours, is the scarcity of fuel.  The common people
burn turf, a few peats, and some heath, carried from the
distance of 8 miles; there being little or no moss in the
parish, but the adjacent to the loch of Eye, and it is ge-
nerally so overflowed with water, by a servitude of the
mills of Fearn, that the proprietor can seldom get any peats
out of it.  The few heritors, and the better fort of farmers,
now burn coal.  But it is of the greatest disadvantage to
the parish, to want fuel, or not to get coal at an easy rate;
for it costs generally 2 s. 2 d. the barrel; and the farmers
and cottagers spend all the summer, and a part of the har-
vest, in procuring some bad turf.
