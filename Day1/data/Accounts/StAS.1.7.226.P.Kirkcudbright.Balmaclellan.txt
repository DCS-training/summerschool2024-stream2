     Statistical Account

   On the north east extremity of the parish, where the soil
is good, and the roads open, there is one large farm already
in part covered with lime from Closeburn, which has yielded
crops by no means inferior to those in the most esteemed
districts of the country.
   The crops produced in this parish are chiefly oats, rye,
barley, and potatoes, the culture of wheat or turnip having
been but seldom attempted in this district.  The plough is
here drawn generally with three, although now frequently
with two horses; and potatoes are beginning to be planted
regularly in drills, so as to admit of the horse-hoeing culture.
On the whole, in this interior part of the country, a metho-
dical stile in farming can yet be reckoned only in its infancy;
and the parish, according to the present mode of cultivation,
is not supposed to grow within itself above three fourths of
its own consumption.
   From the description already given of the surface of the
parish, it will be easily perceived that the greater part is only
sit for pasturage.  The sheep and black cattle are both esteem-
ed good, being of the true Galloway breed; and there is a
greater breed of horses in the parish than might be expected
from the numbers kept.  The little labour required in most
of these farms, added to the cheapness of pasture, generally
disposes the farmer to turn some of his mares to breed, which
in two or three years repays him better than any other way
in which he, could have employed his capital.  From a pretty
accurate computation, there are supposed to be in the parish
8200 sheep 1340 black cattle, 130 horses, a few goats, and
not more than a dozen of swine.
   The valuation of this parish in the county books is 3481 L.
Scots; the present rental nearly 1900 L. Sterling.  This is
divided among 14 proprietors, of whom only three are resi-
dent.  The principal heritors are the Honourable John Gor-
