     Statistical Account

writer, are industrious, sober, and decent, in all re-
spects.  The same may be said of the generality of the
other class of inhabitants; although, it must be owned,
there are exceptions, which, it is apprehended, would 
still be fewer, if spirituous liquors were more rare; and 
perhaps also, if parents were more attentive in teaching
their children the first lesion of obedience to themeselves:
for by preserving the curb of parental authority, the young
would be in a great measure prevented from contracting
habits of dissipation in the early part of life, which after-
ward are not casily eradicated.

   The people are of the middle size, with a due propor-
tion of bodily strength, capable of enduring hardships;
sagacious, humane, and benevolent.  Many are seriously
disposed, and all for the most part regular in their attend-
ance upon the public ordinances of religion.

   Advantages and Disadvantages.-The advantages have
already been stated in the course of this inquiry.  The
only obvious disadvantage is the want of manufactures;
which, from the increase of population, is already felt,
and must be still more sensibly felt, if the population holds
on in a progressing state.  In the event of manufactures
being established, the many small farms would, from that
circumstance, acquire additional value; in which both
landlord and tenant would have a joint interest.  And it
is humbly presumed, considering the advantages of public
roads in all directions; of coal, lime, free-stone, and tim
ber upon the spot; and every rsource that rivers and ri-
vulets may yield, that no place can be more favourably 
situated for many branches of manufacture, to which those 
articles are essential.
