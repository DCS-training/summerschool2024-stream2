plained of by them, that they could not clear their goods, or
bring them to such a degree of whiteness as they wished,
owing to the water being so often turbid, they shifted their
station to the parish of Neilston.  Since this change took
place, the bleaching carried on by their successors, has been
but in a languishing state, and we believe is now entirely
given up.  If this be an incurable defect in the water of
Cart, it accounts for its having been so little occupied for
uses of this kind; as otherwise, there are certainly very fa-
vourable situations in the parish, for prosecuting the busi-
ness of bleaching.-The paper manufacture, too, was very
early attempted here.  One Nicholas Deshan, a paper-
maker, who, we are told, was driven from France, his na-

of Nantz, took refuge, and established his business in this
parish, about the end of the last century.  Having connect-

very lately; but not finding it a profitable business,
the present proprietor of these buildings, has converted
them into a snuff manufacture, which yields him a more
certain and permanent profit.-Higher up the stream, a
paper work is still carried on.  In this business a consi-
derable stock is engaged, and 8 men usually find employ-

writing paper, are manufactured.  It would appear, that
the same defect, which is complained of in the bleaching
business prevents them also from carrying this manufac-

one for the lands of Dripps above mentioned.  Two of
these, are kept up by the services, which the tenants in the
