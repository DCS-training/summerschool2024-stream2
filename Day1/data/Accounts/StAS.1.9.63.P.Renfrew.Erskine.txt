is occupied by 10 proprietors, who keep in their own hand
the whole or some part of their ground; by 48 tacksmen,
who may be called farmers, in so far as they subsist wholly
or chiefly by their farms; by 12 who have smaller farms,
and when not employed upon them, work as day-labour-
ers; and lastly, by 22 handicrafts men, or people of diffe-

valued rent of the parish is L. 4451 Scots.  The real rent
is at present about L. 2980 Sterling.

light soil and moist climate of Erskine.  He perceived, at
the same time, that the system of the country was bad, and
that by more gentle cropping, by more plentiful manuring,
