  An ancient and interesting grave was also found last year, on the
farm of Downby, by the proprietor, from the plough accidentally
coming in contact with its cover stone. It contained a human
skeleton, which could not be got out entire, but which seemed to
have been buried in a sitting posture, and at the right hand lay a
mallet bead of gneiss, finely marked with dark and light layers,
and beautifully polished, now in the museum in Stromness. The
head lay north-west by north.

  The amount of the population at each census, taken at the

seamen, 1019 ; but when I took an account of my parishioners in
1833, visiting every cottage, I found it amounted to 1088, and,
according to the present return for this Account, it is 1056.

belonged to other parishes: deducting the latter, who wopuld probably take their
wives to their own homes with them, we obtain the above number.
  In many case, there are females living in cots by themeselves, which makes the
