common in translations.
   Mr Patrick Bannerman was translated from St Madoes,
and admitted minister of Kinnoul, 13th November 1746, and
remained minister there till November 1760, when he was
translated to the parish of Salton, in the presbytery of Had-
dington.
   Mr Patrick Meik was translated from the parish of Monei-
dy, to Kinnoul, July 29th, 1761, and died there, 18th
July I782; and the present incumbent was translated from
the parish of Dunning, in the presbytery of Auchterarder,
and was admitted minister of Kinnoul on the 7th Novem-
ber 1782.
   The church was rebuilt in 1779.  It is a decent and commo-
dious house of worship; but by rough too small for accommo-
dating the parishioners.  Several families have been obliged to
take seats in the churches of Perth, a circumstance which dimi-
nishes the provision for the poor which depends on the weekly
collections of this parish.  The church is beautifully situated on
the banks of the Tay, opposite to Perth; upon the north side of
it, there is an aile, belonging to the family of Kinnoul, and
which was the burying-place of that noble family, till about 20
years ago, when a vault was built for that purpose, on the east
end of the church of Aberdalgie.  In 1635, an elegant monu-
ment was erected on the north wall of the aile, to the memory
of chancellor Hay, the first Earl of Kinnoul; in the middle of
which, is a statue of his Lordship, as large as the life, dressed
in his robes as chancellor, and embellished with escutcheons,
and coats of arms.  It is a very striking likeness of that great
man, if we can judge from the best portraits of him in Dup-
plin castle.  There is no inscription on the monument.
   The manse was built in 1735; it has received some addition
since, and has been at different times repaired.  The stipend
