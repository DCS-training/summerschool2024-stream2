and in the back ground you perceive the green summits of
the Ochills, stretching westward from the neighbourhood
of Perth, to where they decline at the scene of the battle
of Sheriffmuir near Dunblane.  Mr Kinloch, too, has done
much in the way of improvement; his grounds are well

in the county, is thriving very well.  From the vicinity
of Perth, 16 miles to the southward, it appears a large,

intends to continue it along the whole extent of the hill
westward, till it join the Duke of Athole's march, at the
barony of Laighwood.  This large wood, lined longitudi-
