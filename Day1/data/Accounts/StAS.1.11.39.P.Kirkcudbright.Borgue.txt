of both, constitutes the staple of the country. The average
price of wool, of the sheep bred in the parish, is 16 s. per
stone, of 28 lb. avoirdupois.  Muir sheep, brought down in
harvest, answer very well without smearing, and the wool
improves in quality. The wool of the Cheviot appears to be
of the same quality with that of the natives. The Cheviot
sheep are very well made.  By crossing the breed of them
with the Shetland, whose wool is remarkably fine, it is pro-
bable that both the quality of the wool and of the mutton will
be improved.-The soil here is no less adapted for horses than
for cattle.  Not many are reared for sale; though, under proper
management, they commonly pay extremely well, and are
esteemed much more durable, for the purposes of agriculture,

   Commerce, Manufactures and Fuel.-The prices of vivres
of all kinds are regulated by Kirkcudbright, which is our
nearest market town, being only four miles distant.  This
district has long been deservedly celebrated for fine honey.
It is clear us crystal, and of the richest flavour.-A small
manufacture of cotton has lately been established at Kirk-

increase with rapidity.  Until the duty on coal is taken off,
it is not to be expected, that population will greatIy increase,
or manufactures of any kind be carried on with spirit.  This
partial and oppressive tax is highly prejudicial to agriculture,
as well as to manufactures.  The farmer must be employed
during a considerable part of the summer months, in prepar-
ing and bringing home his peats; the materials of which are
with great difficulty dug from deep pits, carried to a consi-
derable distance, and must afterwards be mixed with water,
kneaded, and formed into loaves, after the manner that the
