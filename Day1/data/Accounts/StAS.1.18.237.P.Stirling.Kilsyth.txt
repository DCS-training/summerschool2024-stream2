     of Kilsyth.

Great Britain; and happily it is inexhaustible.  The colour
of it is exquisite; for the most part, it is a beautiful white,
with a tinge of yellow.  But some of it is finely variegated
with brown and yellow veins, like marble.  Other parts of
it are decorated with the most delicate vegetable impressions,
as black as coal.  Some of these are as small as a hair, and
when the stone is finely polished, they are a beautiful contrast
to the rest of the mass.  I believe no free-stone is capable
of a finer polish.  For though it is soft and easily wrought
when first brought from the quarry, it becomes daily whit-
er and harder when exposed to the weather.  It becomes
hard, white, and of a fine consistence; and so durable, as to
stand all weather, and suit every climate.  Of course, it is
equally calculated for building above or below the surface of
the earth or water; and for the finest ornaments, and strong-
est and coarsest pieces of architecture.  In the erection of
bridges, where it is exposed to the constant attrition of the
water, and in paving streets, it is particularly useful.  Of
course, it is much esteemed in Glasgow, and wherever it is
known.  Many streets in the New Town of Glasgow are
paved with it; and it has been formed into some of the
finest ornaments, such as vases, columns, and fretted work.
The demand for it is great, and it is sold at a reason-
able price.  Even when delivered at Glasgow in blocks,
it is only 2 s the yard for pavement; and there are upwards
of 1000 tons conveyed to Glasgow by the great canal every
year*.
   I am convinced if its value were known, there would be
a greater demand for it than there is from many places of Scot-

*This quarry is set at L. 40 sterling annually.  Each quarier is allowed 7 d 1/2
the yard, for his work.  Land carriage to the canal costs 3 pence per yard;
for lordship 3 pence; trackage and tonnage in the canal are trifling.
