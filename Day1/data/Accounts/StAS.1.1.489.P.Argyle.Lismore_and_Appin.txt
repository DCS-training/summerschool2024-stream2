till last autumn, when another ship, with emigrants, mostly
from Appin, and the higher parts of Ardchattan parish, car-
ried away about 200 people for North Carolina.  Prepara-

this year.

   Births, Deaths, and Marriaged.-It is a difficutl matter to
ascertain exactly deaths, births, or marriages, in thease exten-
sive parishes, particularly on account of the great number of
Episcopals and sectaries in Appin.  It is impossible to deep
any register of deaths, because there are seven of eight dif-
ferent places of interment, and some of these at great distan-
ces from each other.  There are several christenings in Glen-
co not inserted in the Register, as also all that are baptised
by the sectaries.

   Rent, etc.-The rent of these parishes has increased
exeedingly within these few years.  When the present in-
cumbent gave in a rental reutal lately, in a process of augmenta-
tion, it amounted only to L. 4400 and odd pounds yearly.  As
present, the rantal is about L. 8000 Sterling yearly, eclusive
of keip, woods, etc.  Some lands in the parish are let at 102,
the acre, and some even higher; but this is not the case in
general.  These are 17 heritors possessed of property in these
parishes; eight of whom are resident.

   Crops.-The only crops raise in these parishes are oats,
barley, and potatoes, with a little flax.  From the small trials

little clover and rye-grass on his glebe for 18 to 20 years
past, and he finds great benefit from it.  Most of the rents
of Linmore are paid in kind, i.e. in meal and barley.  Some
