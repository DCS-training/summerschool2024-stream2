fertile, that without improvement would have remained
barren, or even makes an acre of good land considerably
better, is more entitled to the esteem of mankind than all
the train of conquerors, 'From Macedonia's madman to
'the Swede.'-As the distance here from the most valu-
able manures is so great, it were much to be wished that
the farmers, though some of them do a great deal, yet
would still do a little more with such as they have in their
power.  By paring and burning the surface of mossy and
benty ground, as is the custom in many parts of Scotland,
great quantities of ashes might be produced, which, for the
time they last, are as good a manure as lime.  By gather-
ing into heaps, while full of sap, thistles, fern, ragweed, all
forts of green vegetables, and covering them with earth till
they rot, an excellent manure may with a little industry
be procured.  The dung and urine of animals, which are
manures that suit every foil, and are, for the time they last,
as effectual as any, might be preserved more entirely than
they generally are, and mixed with other ingredients to
make them cover a greater extent of land.  The channel
of the cow-house of byre might, especially in summer, if
the cows lie within, be covered with thin turf, or surface
earth, together with chass, straw, or litter of any kind, by
which means the stale of the cattle, and the sap of their
dung, might be very completely preserved.  As the sap of
a dunghill is the most valuable part of it, and yet is in the
greatest danger of being at least partly lost through inatten-
tion, it may be preserved by the following method:-
Make the seat of your dunghill either in a place naturally
hollow and dry, whence the sap may have no descent, or
in a foot naturally dry, and artificially dug to a consider-
able depth, or banked all around with earth to a consider-
able thickness; cover the bottom two or three feet deep
with the finest surface earth you can conveniently find; on
