the children get 8s. 6d. per quarter each. The total amount dis-
tributed among the poor, young and old, is about L.88, 8s. annual-
ly, besides house rents to some, and occasional supplies to others,
in time of distress. The sums for the support of the poor are
raised by assessment by the collections at the church, which amount
annually to about L.15, and by proclamations of marriage, and by
mortcloths, and by L.4 of interest of money mortified by the late
Alexander Hay, Esq. of Drummelzier, once the patron of this pa-
rish. The assessment for this year amounts to L.70. Out of the ses-
sion funds, the session-clerk, the precentor, and officer, are paid small
salaries. The patron of the parish occasionally sends donations
to the minister for the su port of the industrious poor, not on the
list, who may stand in need of some temporary supply; and his
lady benevolently distributes among them coals and clothes annu-
ally, as their necessities require.
   The receiving of parochial aid is here now reckoned no degra-
dation. Many demand it as a legal right; and instances are not
uncommon of active young men in good circumstances, who do not
think it incumbent on them to supply the wants of their aged pa-
rents, but who without scruple, consign them to the support of the
parish.
