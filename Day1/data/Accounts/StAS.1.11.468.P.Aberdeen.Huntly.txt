     Statistical Account

benan and Kinore were united by a decree of the Lords of
Session and Plantation of Kirks, and called the parish of
HUNTLY, in honour of the Duke of Gordon's eldest son; and
a place of worship erected, centrical to both, in the year 1727.

   Extent and Roads.-The extremity of that part of the parish,
called Kinore, is distant from the town of Huntly 3 computed
miles, over very rough and rocky ground; and to the extremity
of the other, called Dumbenan, it is also 3 computed miles,
equally rough and rocky; and, indeed, in those parts where
the roads through the parish have been attempted to be made
by statute labour, as they have hitherto been conducted, they
are often impassable.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The air of Huntly is falubrious.
There are no distempers peculiar to this place, but what are
common to other manufacturing towns.  Weavers, and those
whole business confines them to low and damp shops, may be
more subject to asthmatic and scorbutic complaints, but the
place, on the whole, is healthy, and the inhabitants, who
are in general sober and industrious, live to a good age.
There are many now living in the parish aged from 70 to 87;
and one died a few years ago aged 90.  But the number of
ale houses, and private retailers of spiritous liquors, not only
becomes hurtful to the health, but very prejudicial to the
morals of the lower class of tradesmen and mechanics.

   Hill, etc.-In Kinore there is a hill called St. Mungo, on
the W. side of which there is a spring issuing from it, called
St. Mungo's Well, of no medicinal quality but what arises
from superstitious credulity.  On the top of the N. end, there
is a large circular opening, which, in a rainy season, is full
of water, and seldom quite empty.  In very dry summers
