produce a moderate quantity of excellent line.  A species
of limestone, called by some stone-marl, is dug out of a
quarry at Cuttlebrae, in the Duke of Gordon's lands,
spread on the field, and left to the operation of the seasons
to pulverize it.  This is reckoned an expensive, nut valu-
able manure.  As most people have access to one or other
of the above manures, recourse is seldom had to lime, though
it can be procured in sufficient quantity for the purposes of
agriculture.

   Seed Time and Harvest.-As the soil is early, seed time
for pease seldom commences before the middle of March;
for oats it begins about the 26th, and continues to the end
of April or middle of May; and for barley thence to the
middle or end of June.  Harvest begins about the middle
or end of August, and is finished in October*.

   Crops, Produce, and Rent.-It is no easy matter to state
with any kind of precision, what proportion of the farm is
allotted to each kind of grain.  Here no uniformity can be
expected, because the least alteration in circumstances may
introduce deviations from established rules.  The following
however, is the most satisfactory state of the general practice
that I have been able to obtain.  One fourth of the farm
is laid down with pease and barley; scarce one fourth in
grass; and the other two fourths in oats. fallow, flax, tur-
nips, and potatoes.  Wheat is seldom sown by the tenants,

*In 1782, recorded in Scotland for the failure of the crop, this parish
had the good fortune to escape the general calamity.  Scarcely had they
ever a better crop, or more to spare.  The great demand for meal and
seed, and the high prices which they brought, bettered their circum-
stances.  Seed-oats and meal fold at L. 1, and barley at L. 1, 5 s. the 
boil.
