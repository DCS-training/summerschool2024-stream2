   About the beginning of this century, it became necessary
to station a company of soldiers at Inversnaid, in the parish of
Buchanan, in order to suppress the depredations of freeboot-
ers, who then inserted this neighbourhood.  Proper barracks
were built for them, and a very tolerable road carried through
the whole length of this parish, by which, alone Inversnaid is
accessible.  Several bridges have been thrown over the tor-
rents, by the judicious application of the vacant stipend which
has fallen from time to time; and the roads are still impro-

who, with great propriety, has lately converted the statute
labour into money.

   Poor and Schools.-The number of poor at present in the
parish roll is about 24.  Of there, not above 4 or 5 go about
as common beggars.  The rest are able, in some measure, to
contribute to their own subsistence, and receive, from time to
time, some aid from the parish funds, which, at an average,
amount to 22 L. annually.  They consist of the following
particulars, viz.
