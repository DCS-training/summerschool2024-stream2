   Agriculture.-The land under tillage is nearly 5000 acres.
The waste land is about 2000.  Of this a third part might be
advantaneously improved.  About 400 acres are planted.
   Average rent of land in cultivation is 14s. per acre.
   The sheep are of the South Down, Leicester, and Scotch
breeds.  Several farmers have superior cattle, chiefly of the old
Aberdennshire breed.  Lord Kintore has long had a very select.
stock of Ayrshire and short-horn or Teeswater cows and bulls,
and is very indulgent to his tenantry in this matter.  The Keithhall
ox, as one of his Lordship's bullocks was called, was for some time
on of the greatest wonders in the north of Scotland.  Thid animal
carried the first premium at the Highland Society's show in 1834,
was sold at seven years of age for one hundred sovereigns, and cer-
tainly was one of the hugest animals ever seen in the shambles.
The gross weight of the bullock alive was 1 ton 8 cwt. or
8136lbs.
   There as been a considerable extent of waste land reclaimed
within a short time.  The duration of leases is ninteen years.
   All the turf-covered houses have disappeared.  A few of the
farmers have their houses slated, and the others are neatly thatch-
ed.  The enclosures are mostly of stone.  Lord Kintore brought
a hedger from berwickshire, a few years ago, and has planted
hedges of hawthorn on several farms.
   None of the proprietors give any encouragement for improving
waste gound.  Only two or three individuals have accepted the
terms of one who advances money at seven and a-half percent on
that security.
