     of Abercorn,

der the direction of Sir William Bruce of Kinross.  Mr
Adam afterwards took up the plan, and completed it in
the time of the second Earl.  Considering the wealth
which has been employed, in the course of a century, and
under the direction of excellent taste, in beautifying a place
possessed of so many natural advantages, it is not wonderful
the result should be general admiration.  I forbear giving
a detailed description of this princely seat, which is visited
by all those who travel through Scotland, and fully celebrat-
ed by every itinerant bookmaker.

   Abercorn Estate.-Abercorn appears to have been always
a principal estate in Linlithgowshire.  The sheriffship of
the shire belonged to it previous to the passing of the juris-
diction act.  In the 13th century it belonged to the Gra-
hams.  Sir John Graham of Abercorn, the friend of Wal-
lace, fell in the vicinity of Falkirk, fighting for the liberties
of his country against Edward I. of England, on the 22d of
July 1298.  Since that time it has belonged to several
noble and distinguished families, the Douglasses, Mures,
Lindsays, and Setons, from whom it came to one of the
ancestors of the present proprietor, as formerly mention-
ed.  Its extent was greatly diminished when sold by Sir
Walter Seton; but it has regained its original importance in
the possession of the family of Hopetoun.  An authentic
history of such an estate, for a long period, would be a cu-
rious and interesting work, exhibiting its transitions from
family to family, and the additions and diminutions which
is experienced, according to the rise and fall of the fortunes
of its possessors.

   Abercorn Wall.-The wall built by the Romans in the
time of Antoninus, between the Friths of Forth and Clyde,
has been called by some historians the Wall of Abercorn.
