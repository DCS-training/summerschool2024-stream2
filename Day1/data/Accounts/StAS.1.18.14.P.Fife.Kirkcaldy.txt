     Statistical Account

seams of coal from 2 1/4 to 4 1/2 feet thick were formerly wrought;
but they have for sometime been exhausted above the draining
level.  They continue, and are supposed to be more valu-
able, below the level; but the expence of machinery for
draining, has hitherto prevented the working of them.-At
present, the inhabitants are supplied from the coaleries of Dy-
sart, belonging to Sir James St. Clair Erskine, or of Cluny,
belonging to Mr Ferguson of Raith.  The former is distant
from Kirkaldy about 2 miles, the latter about 4.  At the for-
mer, 2 meters, about 9 1/2 cwt of small coals or thews, the kind
generally used for home consumption, are sold for 2 s. 1 d. and
the expence of carriage to Kirkaldy is 1 s: At the latter, 3
loads, weighing about 9 3/4 cwt. are sold at 1 s. 6 d. and the ex-
pence of carriage is 2 s. There is a depot of Cluny coals kept
at Kirkaldy for exportation; from which about 600 tons have
been annually shipped during the last 5 or 6 years, partly for
Hamburgh, but chiefly for Middleburg, where the Cluny splint
is said to have the preference of every other species of Scotch
coal.  As there is now a turnpike road from Cluny to this
place, it is probable that the quantity of coal exported from
it will increase.

   Turnpikes.-Turnpikes begin to be generally introduced in
this part of the county.  The erection of toll-bars, and the
imposition of the highest toll which the law permits to be
exacted before a foot of road was made, excited at first, a pre-
judice against them.  But in proportion as the roads have
been put in repair, the prejudice has abated: And there can
be no doubt, that if the interest of the public is sufficiently
consnited in fixing the courses of the roads, the introduction
of turnpikes will, on the whole, be beneficial*.
