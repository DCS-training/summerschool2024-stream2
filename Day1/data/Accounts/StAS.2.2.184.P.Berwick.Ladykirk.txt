   Husbandry.-Generally speaking, the rotation of crop is to have
two year's pasture, and to sow down with the crop succeeding the
fallow or turnips. There is, however, a peculiarity in this parish
very unusual in the low districts in Scotland, viz. that nearly one-
fourth part of the whole land is in pimennial pasture, generally
speaking of the finest quality, and capable of fattening oxen of the
largest size; and, by a deed of entail by the late Mr Robertson of
Ladykirk, it cannot be ploughed up.
   In the year 1788 this gentleman, remarking the superior qua-
lities of a beautiful description of cattle in the possession of a few
yeomen and farmers in the county of Durham, particularly the late
Messrs Collings, purchased seventeen of them, which were consi-
dered to be the best of the breed, and fixed an extra price on this
kind of cattle now so celebrated. One of the cows thus brought
to Ladykirk appears to have possessed extraordinary properties;
and from her the whole existing race of short-horns have descend-
ad. Her name was Strawberry, bought from a Mr Mainard by C.
Colling. She produced the famous bull Bolingbroke, and was sis-
ter to old Phoenix, from whence sprung Favourite, Comet, &c.
The latter bull sold at 1000 guineas, and the blood is now univer-
sally diffused throughout the kingdom. The sheep are of the Lei-
cester breed, and great attention is paid to this description of stock.
   The general duration of leases is nineteen or twenty-one years.
The farm-buildings are generally commodious, and the enclosures
well preserved.
   Fisheries.-There are three stations for salmon-fishing, and the
rest of the whole at present is L. 100 per annum, which is about
one-half the former rent, the quantity of the fish having greatly
decreased.
