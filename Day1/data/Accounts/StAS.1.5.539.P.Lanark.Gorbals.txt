     of the Gorbals of Glasgow.

     NUMBER  XXXVIII.

     PARISH OF THE GORBALS OF GLASGOW,

     (COUNTY OF LANARK.)

     By the Rev. Mr WILLIAM ANDERSON.

     Name, Erection, Extent, etc.

   The Gorbals of Glasgow was disjoined from the parish
of Govan, and erected into a separate parish the 21st
of February 1771.  The ancient name of the village was
Bridge-end.  Its modern name is the Gorbals of Glasgow.
The village and burying ground only were at first erected
into a new parish, containing about 12 or 14 acres.  The
lands of Rea, of Little Govan, and Polmadie, containing
about 500 or 600 acres, and the barony of Gorbals, be-
longing to the city of Glasgow, the patrons of Hutchison's
hospital, and the Trades-House of Glasgow, (containing
upwards of 400 acres,) were afterwards, at the desire of
the inhabitants of these lands, annexed to the parish of
Gorbals by the presbytery of Glasgow.
