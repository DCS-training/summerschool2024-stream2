     Of Rutherglen.

Of the weavers, 10 only continue at customary work; the
rest are employed in the muslin branch.  Most of the ma-
sons prosess the wright business.  About three fourths of
the smiths are nailers, and work to employers in Glasgow.
Mr Robert Bryce hath distinguished himself for making
edge-tools, especially augers and screws, both black and
polished.  He sells the black from 3 s. 6 d. to L. 1, 5 s. the
dozen, wholesale; and the polished, from 13 s. to
L. 2:9:6 the dozen.  His carpenters and coopers
axes and adzes, are sold from 5 d. to 8 d. the lb.  All his
tools, on account of their excellent workmanship, and ex-
tremely good temper, are preferred, in Glasgow and
Greenock, to any from England.  His demands are al-
ways greater than he can execute.  For grinding his tools,
he prefers the stones from Hamilton-hill, in the neighbour-
hood of Glasgow, to Newcastle grindstones.  The former
are composed of a smaller grit than the latter, but take
down remarkably fast; they wear equally round, because
no part of them is harder than another; and they are not
intermixed with nodules and streaks of the martial-pyrites,
which are extremely hurtful to edge-tools, and frequently
render grindstones totally useless.-Mr Bryce hath also ac-
quired a peculiar skill in the dextrous management of bees.
He can, without killing the queen-bee, unite different
swarms, or parts of swarms, and make them keep together
in harmony: His apiary is sometimes stocked with
42 hives.-There are two printfields in the parish,
known by the names of Rutherglen and Shawfield-bank
printfields.  The former is carried on by Mr Cummin and
Company, and the latter by Mr Dalgleish; they employ
about 200 persons.  All the women in the parish find a-
bundance of suitable employment.  Every 4 looms give
work to at least one woman, who winds the yarn for them.
