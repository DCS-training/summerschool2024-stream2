   Glenmuick Parish.-Glean muc, are two Gaelic words, which
signify the "Sow's Valley." from which it should seem, that
that animal had some time run wild here, as none are now
kept by the inhabitan s.  This parish is about 15 miles in
length, and lies entirely on the S. side of Dee.  The present
manse and glebe stand in this parish on the N. bank of the
small river Muick, about 200 yards from its junction with
the Dee.  The manse is an old house, small, but in tolerable
repair.  The glebe, by a late addition, contains 6 1/2 acres.
The stipend, including the small tithes of the parish of Tul-
loch, is 67 L. 12 s. Sterling, all in money.  The church of
Glenmuick stands close by the manse.  It is a very old house
thatched with heath.  It seems to have been dedicated to the
Virgin Mary, from an annual meeting of the inhabitants on
Candlemas day.  There is a parochial school here, with a
salary of 100 merks in money. The small river Muick takes
its rise in the Grampian hills, from a large lake or loch of
the same name, S. W. of the church, and after forming a
large water-fall, called the Lin of Muick, is lost in the Dee,
after a course of 10 miles.  Across the Muick, and near the
church, there is a very useful and substantial stone bridge of
one arch, built about 50 years ago by subscription, and about
half a mile below the church, a beautiful bridge of three
large arches; and a small one at each end, called the Bridge
of Ballatar, was lately built by subscription, and other contri-
butions, under the patronage of the late Francis Farquharson,
Esq. of Monaltrie; a gentleman who has left many lasting
monuments of his public spirit in this country.  In this pa-
rish are the celebrated wells of Pananich, on the N. side of
a hill of the same name, about 2 miles E. of the church*.
