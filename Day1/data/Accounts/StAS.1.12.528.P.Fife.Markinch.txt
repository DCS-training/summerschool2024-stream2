has been mostly put into excellent repair.  On this road there
are several bridges within the bounds of this parish; but 3
only of such consequence as to deserve notice; one over the
Orr, another over Lochty, a small water, about a mile N. of
the Orr; and another over the Leven, near Balbirnie.  The
first of these is very old and narrow*.  The other two have
been lately rebuilt.  There is another line of road, which
leads from Kirkcaldy to Cupar, and passes through the east-
ern part of the parish.  On this road there is another excellent
bridge over the Leven at Cameron.  There is also a public
road, which leads from Kinross to Leven, Largo, and the east
coast, and nearly divides the parish in the middle.  It is in
tolerable order, though not yet in the same state of repair
with the two just now mentioned.  On the W. road, there
is a toll-bar near the northern extremity of the parish; and
another on the E. road, at Windygates, near Cameron bridge.
Besides the bridges already taken notice of, there is one over
the Orr, about a mile and a half above its influx into the Le-
ven; and two over the Leven, one at Balgonie, and the other
at Balfour.  The by-roads are in a very bad condition.  In
winter, and in wet weather, even during the summer months,
they are, in many places, almost impassable.  This evil the
parish of Markinch feels in common with the rest of the coun-
ty; to remove which, some effectual remedy ought surely to
be, as soon as possible, applied.  Good toll roads are doubt-
less highly advantageous to a country: but the advantage will
be almost entirely confined to passengers, and those who live
in the immediate neighbourhood, unless a ready communica-
tion with these be opened up for the remoter parts of the
country, by putting the by-roads into a proper state of re-
pair.

Andrew's, son to the laird of Balfour in this parish.
