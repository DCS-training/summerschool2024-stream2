west division approaches to the figure of the larger segment
of an half-elipse, and is separated from Dalmaik by the
Gormack-burn, which makes an oval sweep from the
N. W. to the N. E. point.  Its length is 3 miles, its great-
est breadth as many; but it diminishes at the north-west
boundary, to a quarter of a mile.  It contains ten ploughs.
Culter burn separates the estate of Culter from the barony
of Kenarty, which makes the second or south division of
the parish, extending from the burn to the south-west, be-
yond the church of Dalmaik.  In that direction it is above
3 miles long.  In some places it is 2 miles broad, in others
1 mile; and towards the south-west boundary, it is not ma-
ny paces in breadth.-The eastern division may he said
to be a many-sided trapezium.  Its breadth from N. to S.
is 5 or 6 miles; except on the W. side, towards the burn
of Leuchar, where it diminishes to 3 miles, and at last to
the half of that measure.  From E. to W. it measures
from 5 to 3 miles.  This is the largest division, and com-
prehends the estates of Culter and Countesswells, and the
lands of Murtle.-The figure of the parish being so irre-
gular, it would be difficult to compute its square contents.
There was never any survey made of it, except of Coun-
tesswells and Murtle.

to the seat of the Honourable Mr Duff of Echt, and to the house of
Skene.  By means of this, and other streams, the communication might
be carried forward, between Castle-Fraser and Kemnay, to the river Don,
joining it not far from the termination of the intended canal betwixt A-
berdeen and Monymusk.  When we consider the present state of the
country, its population, improvement, opulence, commerce, etc. the
construction of such a canal seems to be a remote event; but it may,
like other events of a similar nature, be anticipated by the contemplative
mind.
