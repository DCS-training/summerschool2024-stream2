     of Laurencekirk.

   The same dialect of the English language is spoken here, as
along the greater part of the eastern coast of Scotland.-No
murders or suicides have been committed in this parish,
nor have any emigrated, or been banished from it, so far as
can be remembered.  None have died for want, there
being plenty both of bread and work in the place.-There
is very little waste ground, and no common in the parish.
There is a great deal of inclosed ground.  The peo-
ple are sensible of the advantages of inclosure, when
made properly sencible, which is seldom the case where
stone cannot be had, but at a great distance and expence.-
As a specimen of the change, that has taken place within
these 20 years, with regard to dress, it may be worth
mentioning, that about 18 or 19 years ago, a hatter
came from Edinburgh to settle in the village, and having
arrived upon a Saturday, he attended public worship on
Sunday; but seeing only three hats in the whole church be-
sides his own, he was so discouraged, that he dropped his
scheme, and left the place on Monday.  But were he now
here, he would hardly see a single bonnet in the whole
congregation.  The dress of the women has kept pace
with that of the men, and the stile of living, in general, is
proportionally altered.
