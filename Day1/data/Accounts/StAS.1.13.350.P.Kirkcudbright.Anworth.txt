     Statistical Account

are 10 persons on the poor's list, some of whom are entirely
supported; some who can earn part of their sultenance re-
ceive a quarterly aid, and others an occational one, as their
necessities require.  The fund for this purpose arives from
the weekly collections, amounting to about L. 14 a-year,
from dues received for the use of the mortcloth, fines im-
posed on delinquents, and from the interest of L. 200 lent
money. This last sum has accumulated, partly from do-
nations, and partly from the overplus of the poors funds,
after their necessities had been supplied.

   Antiquities.-There are two old buildings in the parish,
the Tower of Rusco, and Castle of Cardoness.  The for-
mer has a slate roof on it, and is inhabited; the latter has
had no roof in the memory of the oldest person living.
Both are nearly of a square form, and like many of the old
buildings seem to have been designed for strength and mag-
nificence rather than convenience.  They have no characters
on them by which their age can be ascertained; nor can
we find any records in which it is mentioned.  Both these 
stand on the banks of the Fleet; the Tower about 2 1/2 
miles above where the river ceases to be navigable, and 
the Castle a mile below where it becomes navigable.  This 
latter is situated on an eminence, or point of land, looking
towards the bay at the mouth of the river, and a more 
beautiful situation and prospect can hardly be imagined*.

*At the S. W. end of the parish there is a beautiful moat, standing
on a steep and rocky peninsula that juts our into the sea.  It has been
completely fortified by a deep trench, cut quite across the narrow piece 
of ground that joins it to the main land.  Near to this moat stands a thin 
stone, nearly perpendicular, 5 feet 3 inches high, engraved on both sides 
with the rude figure of a cross, accompanied with several ornamental 
strokes, which some antiquaries supposed to be Runic Interiptions. An
