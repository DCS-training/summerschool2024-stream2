upon the acts of Parliament 1469 and 1474, by which all
officers and members of the councils of burghs are appointed
to be annually elected: "That the auld council of the
"town shall chuse the new, in sic number as accords to it;
"and that the new and auld councils together shall chuse

   This ancient custom was at last, 1590, openly challenged
and complained of as arbitrary and illegal by a Mr John
Cheyne, then a member of council, who insisted, that they
should make an annual election, in terms of these statutes,
which they not only refused to comply with, but expelled
