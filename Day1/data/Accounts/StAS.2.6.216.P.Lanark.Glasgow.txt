	It appears from the above statement, that, besides the sum of
L. 116, 5s. 3d. paid to inmates, the produce of the work perform-
ed maintained all the prisotiers, with a surplus of L. 401, 14S. 11d.
--which surplus goes to lessen the expense of repairs on the build-
ings, and the salaries, and wages. The whole deficiency, amount-
ing to L. 590, 10s. divided by 1967, the number committed, shews
that the net expense to the public for every committal is no more
than 6s., the average period of residence being 59 1/2 days. Taking
another view, the dificiency of L. 590, 10s. when applied to 320,
the daily average of inmates, shews the expense of each prisoner
to be L. 1, 16s 11d. per annum, 2s. 10d. per month, or about
8 1/2d. weeky.
	This distinguished establishment, so creditable to the city and
co unty, while inferior to no prison for discipline and cleanliness, is
tonspicuous for tbe economy * with which it is managed. The bare
