in the end of September, October, and beginning of No-
vember.  It is generally observed of the Carse farmers,
that they continue sowing wheat as long as the season will
allow; but I have never seen any spring-wheat here.  This
last autumn there has been more wheat sown in this Carse,
that ever was known in one season in the memory of man.
Autumn 1789 was remarkably wet and rainy, and the far-
mers could not in many places catch a single day to sow
even their fallowed ground.  They depend upon their
wheat crop for paying the landlord, and they seem deter-
mined to make up in this, what they sell short in last sea-
son.  The wheat harvest generally begins the end of Au-
gust, and continues all September; oats, barley and pease
in September and October; and beans in October, or be-

L. 1, 15 s. to L. 2, 15 s. the acre; hill ground from 15 s. to
L. 1, 15 s.  The size of farms is very different, from 40 to
250 acres, and their number is greatly diminished.  Ploughs
are between 60 and 70, drawn by 2 horses, all over the
low grounds; but through the hills, by 2 horses and 2 oxen,
except on 3 farms, where the 2 horse-plough is used.  The
plough which is now universally used here, is much after
the make of Small's.  On one or two of what are called the
Brae-farms, that is, the farms on the slope of the hills,
where the ground hangs, they often yoke 3 horses a-breast.
The middle horse, the leading one, being before the 2 side-
horses, by the length of the head and neck, which makes a
very strong plough, but kneads the ground very much for
the 6 last ploughed surrows of a ridge.  The grounds are
generally uninclosed; there are no stones to build sen-
ces; and hedges nestle such a number of small birds, that
they are generally disliked.  No body sends out cattle with-
out a man or a boy to attend them.  The people seem so
much accustomed to open grounds, that they seldom think
