     Statistical Account of the

   Attempt to found a Professorship of Mathematics.-But before
many years had elapsed, the society thought proper (though
with some prudent cautions) again to burden their funds with
a similar salary, and almost of the same extent, for the esta-
blishment of a professor of mathematics in their seminary.
The minutes of election, which took place in 1703, shew at
once their good will to promote the interests of learning, and
the scanty means with which they were furnished.  It bears,
that "The meeting, taking into their consideration how
"much it may be for the advancement of learning and inte-
"rest of the College that mathematics should be taught
"therein, nominate, appoint and empower Mr Thomas
"Bower to profess and teach mathematics, both publicly and
"privately, in said College: and for the encouragement of
"the said Mr Thomas Bower, until a fitter and better fund
"be procured, do hereby promise and engage unanimously
"to give and accommodate the said Mr Thomas Bower, in
"his diet at the college table, during the winter session of the
"said College, as also to pay him two hundred merks Scots
"out of the college revenue; in case, only, that it appear, af-
"ter clearing the yearly procuration accounts, that the ba-
"lance can bear the same*.

   Royal Visitation, 1716.-Strong marks of disaffection to
government were shewn by some of the masters of King's
College in the time of the rebellion 1716; and a royal com-
mission for visiting both colleges having been issued in July

<FOOTNOTE>

*Doctor Bower, whose reputation for mathematical science stood very high,
sound interest to procure a royal patent or presentation to his office; and a sa-
lary was assigned him arising from a tax on ale and beer within the burgh of
Old Aberdeen.  No provision could be more embarrassing and improper than
this.  Dr Bower, after contending some years with the difficulties of his situa-
tion, demitted his office, and withdrew to London.
