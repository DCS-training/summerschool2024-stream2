     Statistical Account

   EcclesiasticaI State.-The living is exactly 800 merks
Scotch, paid in money, and a glebe.  A new manse is build-
ing.  Small as the stipend is, it does not all arise from the
rents of the parish, 200 merks of it being paid out of the
lands of Skibo, in the parish of Dornoch; which is one evi-
dence that the rent-roll of the district is not very great.

   Manners and Morals.-Notwithstanding the disadvantage
of a rainy climate, surely nothing but that want of industry,
which reigns among the inhabitants, could prevent their
availing themselves of the lime-stone they have in such
abundance, for meliorating their land.  Respecting their cha-

and would not permit the minister of the district to draw up
an account of it, as if conscious that it could not turn out
much in their favour.

   Improvements Suggested.-The greatest improvement, of
which this part of the kingdom is capable, (and indeed it is a
national concern), is that of making an inland navigation,
through this parish, from the E. to the W. sea.  It is but
5 computed miles (or about 7 1/2 English), from the end of
Loch-Shin to a navigable arm of the Western Ocean.  The
loch, (or lake), itself is about 18 miles long.  It was never
fathomed, but is supposed to be very deep.  It is joined to an-
other small loch, out of which the river Shin runs, and enters
the Moray Frith, an arm of the E. sea.  The advantage that
would result, from joining the two seas, to the district in the
neighbourhood, and to the public at large, need not be dwelt
upon.  It would soon be the means of establishing fisheries,
manufactures, commerce and industry, over all the neighbour-
hood.  Perhaps it might also prevent the dangerous and cir-
