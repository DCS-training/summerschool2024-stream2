ist meeting house, was built last Summer on the east fide of
the town.  The methodists have as yet been joined by very
few and as they had a footing here so very lately, I cannot
pretend to ascertain their numbers.

   Schools.-There has been immemorially a respectable
school at Brechin, consisting of a rector and a doctor.
   The rector has a salary of L. 8: 6: 8 sterling, paid. from

Alexander, kings of Scotland, John, Earl of Chester and
Huntington, his brother, Henry, his father, and Juliana, his
mother.  To his charter of foundation the subscribing wit-

Alto.  The original is inserted in a confirmation charter of
James the Third in the year 1477.  It was situated in a ven-

   Here I am under the necessity of making a digression to
