   Climate and Soil.-The climate is healthy, and seems not
so liable to infectious disorders, as other parishes in the neigh-
bourhood.  The putrid sore throat raged with great violence
2 or 3 years ago, in most parishes in the neighbourhood, and
carried off great numbers; but though a few were seized with it
in Crimond, none died of that disorder.  Consumptive disorders
are most frequent here.  At present an infectious sever pre-
vails, which has proved fatal to several.  In spring 1792, 20
people, from 1 to 16 years of age, were inoculated for the
small pox.  One of them did not catch the infection; the
other 19 had them in the most favourable manner.  But not-
withstanding this success, the example is not likely to be
followed.
   The land next the shore is a very light sandy soil, which
produces, in general, weighty crops of bear, pease and beans.
It is easily cultivated, and would produce excellent crops of
early grass; but this husbandry has been seldom attempted in
that part of the parish.  In the N. W. part of the parish, for
2 or 3 miles from the sea, is a light loam, earlier than most
other parts; and some of it produces weighty crops.  Part is
on a clay bottom; much of it is a cold damp late soil, particu-
larly near the mosses; and as a great part of the parish ap-
pears once to have been covered with moss, this soil is to be
found in many places.  The only grain produced here is oats,
bear, pease and beans; the two last in not very great quan-
tities.

   Agriculture and Produce.-It is but lately that any consi-
derable improvements in agriculture were made here.  It is
indeed nearly 60 years since Mr. Irvine of Crimond began to
use lime.  But so little was the nature of that manure known
at that time, that he took 7, 8, and even II successive crops
