the thermometer stands higher during the year in Buittle
than at London.  For some ages, this parish was, in conse-
quenee of the above natural advantages, distinguished as a-
bounding with orchards.  Of late, however, there have fal-

12 or 15 miles up into the country, where they have lived
fed on worms, and even bred for several weeks, and might
have existed much longer, if they could have been supplied
with sea-water.  In a word, it seems probable, that an
