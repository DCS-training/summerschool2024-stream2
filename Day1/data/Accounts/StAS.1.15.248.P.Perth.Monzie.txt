   Conditions and Occupations.-All the inhabitants of this pa-
rish are either proprietors, farmers, tradesmen, or day-la-
bourers.  The great part of the farming work, is done
by the farmers themselves, their wives, their sons, and their
daughters.  There is a great number of pendiclers and cot-
tagers in this parish.  The former class are those who rent
a house and a small piece of ground from the proprietor;
the latter rent it from the tenant, and are obliged to work to
him during the harvest, and even at other times, if it be need-
ful.

   Manufactures.-The principal one in the parish is that of
weaving.  They weave all kinds of plain and tweeled linen,
and woolen cloth; and these not only for their own use, but
also for sale; the chief kinds of cloth made by them are plaid-
