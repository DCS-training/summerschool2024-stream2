     Statistical Account

   The soil is chiefly clay, of various mixture, loam, sand
and till, and some of a lighter mould.  It is good toward
the Clyde, where there is more warmth and shelter; and
there is a great deal of excellent ground in the parish.
   Placed in so fine an exposure to the south, occupying so
large a space, and so commanding a view of one of the
finest countries in Scotland, the situation is from these cir-
cumstances very beautiful, and peculiarly adapted to the
purposes of cultivation.

   Air and Climate.-The air is good, and the climate
healthful.  A ridge of high hills, about ten miles north,
carry off the clouds and vapour, that may be raised from
the Atlantic, or otherwise.  A long stretch of high ground
does the same service on the south; and the parish, on ac-
count of its separate state, happily remains unaffected,
while the storm is driving along both.  The chief incon-
venience arises from the clay soil tenaciously keeping up-
on the surface the rain that falls in winter.  But the de-
clining polition of the parish, the good roads and ditches,
serve as drains, and prevent any sensible bad effects upon
the health of the people.  Their houses are placed upon a
dry situation, and well covered.  There is no disease pecu-
liar to the parish.  When the small pox enter a village,
from their close connexion and mode of frequent visiting
each other in distress, the infection becomes general, but
seldom fatal.  The air at the east end is sharper, the ground
considerably higher, and the snow lies longer.
   Many arrive at old age; yet the employment of the hus-
bandman is not the moss favourable for a very advanced
life.  Engaged in incessant toils, driven often from the ex-
tremity of heat to cold, exposed to all the inclemencies of
the elements; these wear out the best constitutions; and
extreme old age is to be ascribed more to the uncommon
