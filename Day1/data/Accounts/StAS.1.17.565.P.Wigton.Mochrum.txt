   The simple undesigning peasant put thus in possession, sits
not down to study tables of calculation, on the probabilities
of life, the security or the danger that are supposed to attach

adage, which he understands far better; that while a "set
day soon comes," he shall remain unaffected by any such
events, and continue to enjoy, undisturbed, the fruits of his
labours to the end of a long life.

   Manures and Tillage.-The arable and pasture lands of the
parish, it is presumed, may be nearly of equal extent; and
there is not much natural meadow ground.  The lands are
let from 10 s. to 30 s. an acre, and no balliework or services
are demanded.  For many years past, considerable quantities
of fine clay-marl have been dug in Sir William Maxwell's
lands, 50 single horse cart-loads of which being laid on the
acre, produced abundant crops of grain and grass.  This va-
luable treasure appears now to be nearly exhausted, or is be-
come so deep and difficult to work as to exceed the expence
of lime.
   All the lime used here, which may be about 12,000
Carlisle bushels annually, is imported burnt from Whithaven,
at 1 s. 2 d. or 1 s. 3 d. a bushel, of which 45, 50, 60, or
more are put on the acre, according to the ability of the far-
mer, or the quality of the soil.  Shell sand is also brought
hither, in small vessels, from the ferry town of Cree, at 2 s.

this is only used upon lands situated near the shore, its great
weight rendering it too expensive to be carried far into the
country.  After the land has received one or other of these
manures, or rather the stimulants, it is commonly plowed
and sown with oats for 2 years successively, at the rate of 7
or 8 Winchester bushels to the acre, and 5 or 6 seeds are the
