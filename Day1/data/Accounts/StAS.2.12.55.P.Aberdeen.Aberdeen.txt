   House of Industry and Magdalene Asylum.-Within these few
months, the same benevolent individual whose liberality was the
means of establishing the House of Refuge, has conveyed to trus-
tees, named by himself, along with the directors of the House of
Refuge, the property of Oldmill, situated about four miles west-
ward from the town, which yields about L.164 of yearly rent, for
the purpose of erecting and maintaining a House of Industry and
a Magdalene Asylum.  The necessary arrangements are not as
yet completed, but there is no doubt that every possible diligence
will be used, and that these beneficial institutions will be opened
in the course of a very short time.
   Deaf and Dumb Institution.-This institution was opened in
1819, a fund having been raised for the purpose by contributions
gradually collected for a year or two previously, and the direction
and instruction of its inmates were entrusted to Mr Robert
Taylor, who had been sent to Paris to receive the necessary in-
structiom under the celebrated Abb‚ Sicard.  In consequence of
the insufficiency of the funds to provide for the entire maintenance
of the institution, it was found necessary to adopt a rule that one-
half of the board of the pupils only should be defrayed by the in-
stitution, the other half being required to be advanced from
some other source; and although the rate of board charged be on-
ly L. 16 per annum, this rule has in several instances prevented
the admission of children whose parents were unable to raise the
required sum ; though, on the other hand, those who have used
exertions, and made application either to public funds or to bene-
volent individuals have seldom been disappointed.
   Another class of boarders is also received under the charge of
the teacher, who do not draw on the funds of the institution for
any part of their maintenance, and the teacher, whose salary is
only L. 60, is thus enabled, with advantage to the institution, from
the increased number of pupils, to earn a comfortable livelihood.
