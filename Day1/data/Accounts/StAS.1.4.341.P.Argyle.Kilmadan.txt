   Miscellaneous Observations.-There is a mineral spring,
once famous for curing the scurvy and other disorders, but
is not now resorted to.  There are 2 tumuli supposed to
have been raised by the Norwegians, but have not been
opened.-The river Ruail produces salmon, grilse, trouts
of different kinds, par and eel, but not in great quantity,
sold at 4 d. the pound; they are best between May and
August.-There is moor and limestone.  There is a great
quantity of what is called pipe-clay in the parish.  Peats
are the common fuel, and for the most part very ill to be
got, on account of the height of the hills, and bad access to
them.  This is one of the greatest inconveniencies to which
the people are subject.-The inhabitants are much dis-
posed to industry, and it is a pity that some manufacture,
especially in the linen way, is not established among them,
as the soil is so favourable for flax.  They are judicious,
economical, and disposed to generous and humane actions.
They are not remarkable for size of strength; some are
5 feet 6 inches, some 6 feet; the greatest height known
was 6 feet 2 inches.  They are remarkably altered with
regard to their dress within these 30 years; and their li-
ving is little inferior to their dress.  The Gaelic is the
language chiefly spoken.-The people are not averse to the
sea.  There is but one boat in the whole parish.  Few or
none have been in the navy, and none in the army, except
in the Fencibles.-Property has changed three times in the
the present century.  Land sold at 6 years purchase not
50 years ago.  The people complain of high rents.  Poor
people get a house and garden for 10 s. a-year.  The statute
labour is exacted in money.  The bridges are built and re-
paired by the statute money.  Very little land is inclosed.
