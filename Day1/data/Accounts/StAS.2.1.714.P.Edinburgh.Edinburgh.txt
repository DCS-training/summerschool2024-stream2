the whole court; and the Judges of either division are also
empowered to require the opinions of the other division upon
questions stated in writing, or even of the Permanent Ordinaries.
The causes are conducted in the courts by written statements and
viva voce pleadings of the advocates, in the first instance, before
the Lord Ordinary, and afterwards before one of the inner divi-
sions. The decision of the Inner-House is final; but the los-
ing party may, if he choose, appeal to the House of Lords.
The Court of Session tries all questions affecting civil rights, and
decides not only on the law of the cases, but also in matters of
equity. They also constitute the Teind Court, which is held for
the settlement of all civil matters relating to the church.
   The court has two terms in the year,-the winter session com-
mencing on the 12th November, (the Lords Ordinary meeting
on the 1st,) and terminating on the 11th March, (the Lords
Ordinary sitting till 20th March); the other, or summer session,
beginning on the 20th of May, and ending on the 19th July.
During the vacation, one of the Judges, called the Ordinary on the
Bills, attends for the furtherance of routine and summary business.

       Total number of causes brought into the Court of
                 Session in septennial periods.

<TABLE>

   In the seven years ending with 1787 there were 15,292 causes.
                                  1794     ---    18,851
                                  1801     ---    17,579
                                  1808     ---    17,093
                                  1815     ---    17,138
                                  1822     ---    16,560
                                  1829     ---    14,130
                                  1836     ---    13,156
                                  1843     ---    10,816

   It thus appears that the maximum number of cases occurred in
the septennial period ending with 1794, when the average for each
year was 2693. From that period the number has gradually de-
creased; and at present the average number for each year is only
1544. Of this whole number of annual cases, about 311 have
come to decision in the Inner-House, on an average of the last
seven years.
   The salaries of the Judges about a century ago were, to the
Lord President L. 1600 a-year; the Lord Justice Clerk L. 1250;
the ordinary Judges L. 250; and L. 200 additional to each of the
Lords of Justiciary. By a recent act of 29th July 1839, the sa-
laries of the Judges were constituted as follows:-Lord Justice-
General, L. 4800; Lord Justice-Clerk, L. 4500; each of the
other eleven Lords L. 3000 a year.
