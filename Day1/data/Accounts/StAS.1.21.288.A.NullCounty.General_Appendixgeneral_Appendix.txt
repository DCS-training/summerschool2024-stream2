money laid out upon it, is evident, from its giving an inland
navigation of more than 40 miles, being the distance from
the Crinan Canal to the N. E. end of Lochow:  And this
mostly upon one of the largest fresh water lakes in Scotland;
where shoals of salmon, trout, char and eel,-where hanging
precipices of limestone,-and waving forests, nodding o'er
the deep-with the wool of the bleating slocks, spread over a
thousand bites- powerfully invite the genius of commerce to
these long-neglected regions.  From the difficulty of exporta-
tion, the finest and largest salmon have been frequently sold
to the inhabitants at 6 d. each.  The Lochow trout are unri-
valed perhaps in any part of the known world.  They are of
the finest quality, and are found from the smallest size to
30 lb. weight.  As a specimen of the value of the Lochowside
woods:  The stool of oak, upon a farm of 40 L. rent, cut down,
when only 20 years old, for bark and charcoal, though these
articles could be exported only by an expensive land carriage,
sold, more than 30 years ago, at 800 L. sterling, What then
must be the value of such woods, when they can be removed
by water carriage; some of them probably manufactured into
farming utensils for the comparatively woodless districts of
Kintyre, Islay, Bute, and Arran, and the other Western Is-
lands?  when the establishment of the canal will make ship
building no inconsiderable article of the Lochow trade?  or,
when the Lochow oaks will attract the attention of govern-
ment, and be carefully preserved for the purposes of the
Royal Navy?
   But, though salmon, wool and timber would be the chief
articles of exportation; they are by no means to be considered
as the only ones.  A valuable lead mine has been wrought with
advantage, for a considerable time past, at Tiendrom, with-
in 12 miles of the extremity of Lochow, most distant from
the proposed canal.  Lead and iron ore have likewise been
