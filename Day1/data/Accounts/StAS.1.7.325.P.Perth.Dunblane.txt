the presbytery of Dunblanes chosen by the synod of Perth
and Stirling.
   Mr Lightmaker sent a very rich marble stone, of oval
figure, well cut, having on it Bishop Leighton's arms, with
this inscription, Bibliotheca Leightoniana, and a gilded mitre
on the top of it, which is set upon the front of the house
towards the street, as Lord Strathallan had advised.  The
inscription and carving are now very much defaced.

   Situation and Surface.-This parish, which is about 9 miles
long, and 6 broad, is situated within the western district of the
county of Perth.  It is the seat of a presbytery, which bears
its name, and subject to the superior jurisdiction of the synod
of Perth and Stirling.  The soil is various.  A great part of
the parish consists of arable land.  But the greatest part of
it is moorland, covered with heath, and swampy.  The
grounds, in general, have a gradual declivity from the sur-
rounding hills to the river Allan, which runs through the
parish, giving the name of Strathallan to a considerable track
of land along the river.  These hills are partly green; but,
for the most part, covered with heath.  There are a consi-
derable number of sheep, and some black cattle, grazed up-
on them; but very few of either, in proportion to the extent
of surface.  There is a great deal of moor game here; and
the low grounds produce plenty of hares and partridges,
which afford excellent coursing and shooting.

   Climate, Diseases, etc.-The climate is in general healthy.
The rheumatism is a very frequent disorder among the lower
ranks, and a great number die of consumptions.  Severals
have survived 90, during the incumbency of the present mi
nister; and many now living are above 80.  The ravages
