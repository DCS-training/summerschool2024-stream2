   There are 11 heritors, 4 of whom, at present, reside.
Tradesmen and mechanics, excluding apprentices, are as
follows: Merchants, 20; tailors, 28; weavers, 27;
wrights, 25; smiths, 19; shoemakers, 17; masons, 7
dyers, 2; and 1 physician.  The annual average of bap-
tisms for 7 years previous to 1783, is 50 4/7; and for 9 years
since, ending 1791, it is but 33 2/9.  The only cause that
can be assigned for this decrease, is the tax upon registra-
tion; for, since this tax commenced, there are many chil-
dren (particularly females) born and baptized in the pa-
rish, whose names are not inserted in the register; be-
cause their parents are unwilling to pay the duty.
This indeed is not so much the case in regard to males, for
two very obvious reasons, the chance of emigrations, and
the difficulty of getting an exemption from labour upon
the public roads, without an attested extract from the re-
gister to show that they are superannuated.  It was there-
fore deemed proper to give the average of baptisms, pre-
vious to the date of the act, because no certain conclusion,
with regard to population, can be drawn from them since.
that period, and, even before, many of them were never
desired to be registered; otherwise, instead of 50, the
average number would have amounted nearly to 70.-
Marriages and burials only began to be registered in 1785;
and the average of the former, for 7 years ending 1791, is
18 3/7, and 31 3/7 burials.  But neither of these can afford any
certain data for calculation, for many strangers are buried
