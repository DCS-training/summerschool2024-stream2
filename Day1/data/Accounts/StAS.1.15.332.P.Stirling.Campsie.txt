     Statistical Account

varies according as the coal is soft or hard; every coallier may
be said to be his own drawer; seldom or ever has he any person
to assist him; they commonly go to their work at four in the
morning, and continue until two in the afternoon; formerly
the coals were put out by the dark, consisting of twenty eight
hutches, for which dark the coallier received one shilling and
eight pences and the proprietors had for lordship one shilling
and ten pence; an active workman could very easily put out
two of these darks per day, making three shillings and four
pence; these hutches becoming more and more uncertain as to
the quantity contained in them, both the landlord and public
being imposed upon, it became necessary to adopt some new
regulations relative to the measure; which has been done
accordingly; so that now we compute by loads; each load
contains 2184 cubic inches, equal to twenty one Scotch pints
and a half, water measure; six of these loads make an exceed-
ing good carts which should weigh betwixt twelve and thir-
teen hundred weight; the price, at the pit mouth, being eigh-
teen pence per cart, or threepence per load; a tolerable work-
man can put out twenty four loads per day, for which he has
three shillings; and the landlord the other three shillings.  In
order to ascertain the quantity of coals raised at the different
pits, of which there are no less than sixty going this month of
December 1793, we shall calculate the average out-put of the
coaliers:  There are, in all the different pits, forty six coalliers;
allowing three carts and a half per day to each, makes one
hundred and sixty one carts per day, supposing them only to
work five days in the week; the out-put per week will be eight
hundred and five carts; reckoning the coalliers weeks in the
year only to be fifty, the out-put in the year will be forty
thousand two hundred and fifty carts; supposing that the
measure, at a medium, does not exceed eleven hundred weight
