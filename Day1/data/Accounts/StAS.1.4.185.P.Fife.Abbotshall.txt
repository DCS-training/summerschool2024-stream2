     NUMBER XXIV.

     PARISH OF ABBOT's HALL.

     (COUNTY OF FIFE.)

     By the Rev. Mr GEORGE SHAW.

     Name, Situation, Soil, etc.

   IT is said that an Abbot of Dunfermline built a summer-
house near the place where the church of Abbot's Hall
now stands, and callled it the Hall of the Abbot.  Abbot's
Hall is in the county and Synod of fife, and presbytery of
Kirkaldy.  Its form is very irregular, being intersected in
several places by the neighbouring parishes.  In the broad-
est and longest corners it may be about 2 miles each way.
It is bounded by Kerkaldy on the E. Kinghorn and Auch-
tertool on the W. Auchterderran on the N. and the frith
of Forth on the S.  The general appearance of the coun-
try is very pleasant; it is flat for about near half a mile
north of the coast; from thence rises into pretty high
grounds, or beautiful banks, sloping gently.  The air is
dry and healthy.  The soil, immediately by the town, is
light and sandy, but very fertile, especially in showery
summer.  It can scarcely be hurt by rain, but easily by
drought.  As it rises northwards, it is deeper and stronger,
