   Character of the People.-Within the mountains already de-
scribed, one will naturally expect to find untoward aspects,
with asperity of temper: this conclusion 40 years ago was tru-
ly incontestible, but the greatest change has taken place of late
years.  The natives or Kintail are tall, robust, and well-limb-
ed; able to endure much cold and fatigue; generous and hos-
pitable; and if they are sometimes peevish to strangers, it is
by reason of encroachments on their grazings and hill pasture.
This peculiarly arises from their being wholly devoted to the
pastoral life, without intermeddling with any other branch of
manufacture or trade.  In the last century, or rather later,
the inhabitants of Kintail wore nothing but the woolen manu-
factures of the place; but at present, every individual purchas-
es linen, and affect as much neatness in dress as any of their
neighbours.  It is easy to remark, that their attachment to

battle of Glensheal, 1719, received a commission from government to repair
to Kintail with a select body of men, to collect the rents of that place, in
name of his majesty.  His intentions, however, were announced to the Kin-
tail men, who assembled with great precipitation, and meeting Mr Ross at
a place called Lochan cloigh, 2 miles from Knocfin, a musket was fired from
the summit of a grove, hanging over a pond of water, the ball grazing slightly
the back of Mr Ross's neck, he dismounted instantly, and replaced his son
on his horse.  After this accident, he pursued his journey for 4 miles, till
coming to a place which divides the hill road, called Doir no meatlach, a
party at the foot of a spreading fit-tree, on the opposite bank of the river,
fired and wounded Mr Ross's son.  This second alarm so intimidated the troops,
that Mr Ross was easily persuaded to offer terms of capitulation to the Kin-
tail men, at that time commanded by a Colonel Murcheson; a gentleman,
whose natural parts qualified him for a higher station.-Mr Ross's son,
young Walter, died of his wounds, on his way home, his body was carried on
a litter to the priory of Beaulieu, and there interred.-After this fruitless ex-
pedition, another was attempted next year by the Lochcarron road, by a
captain M'Neal, whose fate was little better.  He received a wound, and
returned immediately.
